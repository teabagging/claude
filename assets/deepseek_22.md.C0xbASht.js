Normally, a follicle ruptures when it is around 28 to 30 mm.2) This means that the body is not responding to HCG injection. So, either the brand or the dosage must be changed.3) Even if the follicle does rupture, chances of pregnancy is less as there is a possibility that the egg might have perished. The egg stays alive for 24 hours only.4) Having said that, however, you need to keep trying for pregnancy.5)Do not lose hope and wish for the very best.Regards,Dr. Shikha S"},{"Patient":"have been trying to conceive for three years but have failed.my gynae put me on letrozole and hyponidd combo but failed too. later she ntroduced me to injections which have also not bore fruits... what could be the problem because i do ovulate normaly. cecyl","Doctor":"Hi there, After going through your query, I am of the opinion that:1) Simply put, infertility could be due to male partner, female partner or both.2) Male factor can be easily tested by a simple semen analysis.3)For the female part, infertility can be caused due to :  - Ovulation problems - Abnormalities in genital tract - Immunological factor.4) This means that if you are ovulating normally and there is no male factor abnormality, problem could be in your genital tract like cervix, uterus and fallopian tubes.5) My suggestion is that you go for a hysterosalpingography to check for tubal potency as the next step.6) If this does not work out, then test for immunological factor can be carried out called PCT ie post-coital test.I hope I was able to be of some assistance,Regards,Dr. SHikha"},{"Patient":"I am 16 years old girl and already a few days my heart palpitations.

From the limited information you have provided, I can gather that you have irregular periods and are trying to conceive. The medroxy progesterone acetate is just a progestogen to induce withdrawal bleeding i.e period. Clomiphene citrate is an ovulation drug most commonly used in patients with anovulatory infertility, which means patients who are not ovulating regularly as evidenced by your irregular periods. It is a safe drug. However, it can sometimes cause multiple pregnancy and ovarian hyperstimulation. It is helpful in a majority of cases where there is no other cause of infertility like male factor or tubal and uterine anomalies. A full picture can be given if you provide reports of hormonal studies, ultrasound and your husband semen analysis. I suggest you do these tests if not already done.To answer your question, YES. Clomiphene is very effective in treatment of infertility.Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us.

USG to know about any structural cause in the uterus that might lead to infertility.If all these tests are normal then you need not worry about getting pregnant.Secondly, you need to know about ovulation.As you might be aware that in a woman with regular cycle day 10 to 20 of the cycle is the most fertile period of the cycle.if you have unprotected sex activity in this period at least on alternate days , it will help to get pregnant.If needed you can seek prescription support from your treating doctor for ovulation induction medicines followed by follicle study from day 10 of the cycle. Whenever ovulation occurs you can opt for IUI- Intrauterine insemination on the day of ovulation or opt for unprotected sex activity on and around the day of ovulation.This all will help you to get pregnant.Also, please start on Folic acid and vitamin B 12 supplements.

It is is an abnormal heart rhythm that occurs when a short circuit rhythm develops in the upper chamber of the heart. Which results in a regular but rapid heartbeat (150-200/min) that starts and stops abruptly. ECG can show rapid heartbeat only during the episode. Diagnosis of PSVT requires continuous heart monitoring (Holter) to catch the episode. For rare and short duration episodes treatment is not indicated. Lifestyle changes can greatly help to prevent PSVT episodes. Try to find out a situation that triggers the episodes and avoid those situations. Alcohol, caffeine, anxiety, exercise or sudden movements may trigger the episode of PSVT. During the episode, you may use vagal maneuvers (coughing, deep breathing, muscle tensing or putting your face in ice-cold water) to stop it. You should seek medical attention if PSVT episode does not go away with vagal maneuvers or the episodes become longer up to a few minutes. Also, avoid over-the-counter decongestants or herbal medicines that may also trigger the episode. Hope I have answered your query.

It can destroy eggs and scar the tunes. Hence time is of vital importance. I recommend :-as you wish, you can try Iui. However success rate is low. -try iui  for 2 cycles, then other options and treatment need to be considered. If you have just one cyst, you may conceive. If many cysts or big cyst, laparoscopy helps in reducing its effects on the hormone levels and also helps to assess the condition of the fallopian tubes.-a hysterosalpingogram (hsg) can be done to check for blocked tubes (a complication in endometriosis). This is where they inject a dye and x-rays are taken it see of it comes out through both tubes (proving patency). It takes 10 minutes. This can help get rid of small blocks too and facilitates conception.  -try to maintain a healthy lifestyle and diet. Take folic acid supplements. Check thyroid and hemoglobin levels.

PROLACTIN, ULTRA TSHUSG abdomen and pelvishusband's semen analysis after three days of abstinenceIf you have gone through all then I generally recommend my patients to go for Diagnostic laparohysteroscopy.about bloating, it can be hormonal changes in premenstrual timings or may be because of some digestion issue. you can give attention to overall nutrition and exercise to reduce such problems.I hope this helps.

So basically you have two eggs for fertilization.The chance of getting pregnant in this cycle is around 15%. If repeated the cumulative pregnancy rate will go higher. Best regards"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Pooja here... Actually i am gonna complete 2 yrs of my marriage in upcoming december but yet i didn t get pregnant after one year i consulted with doctor she suggested me go through follicle study and my report was okay after that i went through hsg en my report told me my both tubes were blocked so i had laparoscopy en luckily my both blockage are opened.. this month we tried to conceive but i got periods.. me en my husband keep losting all hopes to be a parents.. I went to my doctor en she prescribed me oosure m tablet.. Could i be get pregnant with this medicine?? Does it really helps in getting pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for letting us know your health concern. Oosure M is useful in the correction of insulin resistance, folate deficiency and helps to regulate ovulation status. As your difficulty in conception seems to be associated with tubal patency, you may benefit more with ART procedures like IVF. This should be decided by your consultant. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Respected doctor,i am trying to conceive 2 years.i have regular peroids.but my doctor said you had pcod. it is possible..now i amvery scared.my egg ruptuer in 15th day can i pregnent normally.i consult another docter she told ur egg is slow growth but i had regular period...then she priscribe miprogen tablet for my 16th day from please clear my doubt doctor","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for sharing your health concern with us. I have gone through your query and would like to offer some suggestions. It is possible for regular menstrual cycles to happen without ovulation. To establish the diagnosis of PCOD, certain factors like hormone imbalance, altered LH/FSH ratio, abnormal AMH titers, infertility, obesity, abnormal hair growth etc., should exist. If you are anxious to conceive, proper evaluation and plan for further management are necessary. Maintain a healthy lifestyle. You have been prescribed progesterone. This helps in correction of deficiency but not in induction of ovulation. Follow your health care provider for further information. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"My period is irregular after marriage last since 9 month and now my gyn prescribed me M2TONE and deviry10gm will this help me to become pregnant and what is the duration of the course and if I stopped the medicine then is there is the chance of pregnancy without period has been came","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.

My daughter who is only 34 had her first lipid panel done . Everything came back high . Isn t she young for this? She didnt fast before test ,. My husband and I didnt start having those issues til we were in our mid 50 s. She has a cardiac risk factor of 5.8 , cholesterol 256, triglycerides 180, LDL 176, HDL 44 . should they be redone ? Thanks","Doctor":"Hello,Yes, your daughter’s laboratory lipid profile is quite high. This could be a false positive result. Not fasting before the test is a frequent reason for abnormal lipid profile.She should re-take the test. But this time she should fast 12 hours before the test and should not drink alcohol 24 hours before the test.If she is taking medications (example as birth control pills), that may also be a reason for the abnormal lipid panel. Please, consult with your doctor regarding stopping the medications before the test.If the second lipid profile comes high again she needs further investigation (thyroid function test, blood glucose et cetera) to find out the cause of abnormal lipid profile.Hope I have answered your query.

Your studies show normal follicular development. *how much was your endometrial thickness? *have you checked your thyroid, prolactin levels? *has your husband had a semen analysis? How old is he? Does he smoke or consume alcohol? *how long is your menstrual cycle? It takes an average of 6-12 months to conceive naturally with regular intercourse at your age. I recommend :- maintain healthy weight and lifestyle -exercise regularly -Have intercourse every alternate day, especially in the middle third of your cycle. (day 10-20in a 30 day cycle) -minimize stress, stay well hydrated -use ovulation prediction kits & basal body temperature monitoring to pinpoint ovulation date and fertile period (if you have regular cycles) -after 3 more months of trying check for thyroid prolactin and hemoglobin levels, if not pregnant. After a year of trying, See a fertility specialist if you haven't conceived. Pease be positive, try your best but don't focus on it too much. The stress is counter productive.

Further more I understand that the semen examination of your husband has revealed normal sperm count with normal motility.In such case, I would suggest you to go for ovulation monitoring. You will have to submit yourself for ultrasonography from day 9 onwards till the ovulation (egg release) takes place. Usually the ovulation occurs when the follicle of the egg attains the size of 18 mm. Utilize this day , a day before and after this. Plan your sexual intercourse on these days. If there is no other abnormality, this should make you happy. If the ovulation takes place after the follicle attains more than 21 mm size, the chances of fertilization are very poor. May I suggest you one more test, if you have not done it already. Please get the post-coital semen examination done. In this test, semen is collected from your vagina after the intercourse for microscopic examination. Some times, the vagina contains antibodies or environment which is hostile to the sperms. In such cases, the sperms which were normal in semen examination, show dead or sluggish in this test. Thus this test reveals whether your intravaginal environment is hostile to your husband's semen or you have got antibodies against his sperms which is preventing factor for the fertilization. If it is so, you may ask me direct question by going to my profile and upload the reports for my review so that I can advise you some measures. I hope this much advice should give you some direction."},{"Patient":"Dear Sir,My Sperm count is 30%Total Motility is 50%Sperm Motility is Like - Grade I - 30%Grade II - 30%Grade III - 20%Grade IV - 20%Sperm Morphology is - Normal % Abnormal 10% and Dead 60%Pus Cells - 8-10so can you please tell me about my report is it normal or not if no so can u suggest me Which treatment  can i do?","Doctor":"Hi, I think your sperm motility is on lower side.

Sleep as long as necessary to feel rested (usually seven to eight hours for adults) and then get out of bed. Maintain a regular sleep schedule, particularly a regular wake-up time in the morning and try not to force sleep.Avoid caffeinated beverages after lunch especially during evening hours. Avoid alcohol near bedtime (example, late afternoon and evening). Also, avoid smoking or other nicotine intake, particularly during the evening.Adjust the bedroom environment as needed to decrease stimuli (example, reduce ambient light, turn off the television or radio). Avoid prolonged use of light-emitting screens (laptops, tablets, smartphones, and eBooks) before bedtime.Resolve concerns or worries before bedtime. Exercise regularly for at least 20 minutes, preferably more than four to five hours prior to bedtime. Avoid daytime naps, especially if they are longer than 20 to 30 minutes or occur late in the day.If this is not helpful, then you can get prescribed tablet Zolfresh bedtime as needed basis.

So, you need to take some medicines like clomiphene for the growth of your follicles.  Duphaston will not help in growth of your follicles.  It will only support the implantation.  So, track your follicles growth by repeated ultrasound after taking clomiphene and when your follicles is more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for 2 to 3 days after injection.  Take duphaston for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 to  6 months.

Above 40 chances of pregnancy is low, as the of healthy eggs left in your ovary will be very low. But you should try as chance is NOT ZERO .Use of IUD is not a treatment for pregnancy.As you grow older the number of healthy eggs reduce, hence you should know how many eggs are left in ovaries , By Serum AMH level. Beware this only shows the Quantity of eggs , not the Quality of eggs. If value is within normal range you better go for IVF. You should meet an infertility specialist & also get in-depth investigated for those two abortions.

Varicocele alone is not a cause for infertility. Only when all other possible causes have been ruled out, varicocele should be blamed.I assume that repeated semen analysis showed a poor count & quality. Before going for higher management try to remove the cause for the poor sperm quality. Only healthy sperm can give a healthy baby. Kindly confirm if1.your blood sugars/ Serum Thyroid & Prolactin are normal  2. Reduce body weight , if your on to overweight 3. Avoid smoking( even passive smoking )  / alcohol/ any other substance abuse4. Have cold water bath 2-3 time / day if possible5. Try methods to reduce mental stress( I know it's easy to say , but tough to practice)- by meditation , Yoga6. Kindly repeat semen analysis from an infertility centre- with abstinence not less than 3 days & not more than 6 days.If they report any infection / WBC/ Pus cells above normal , you will need a course of antibiotics for 2 weeks.Expecting your wife's tubal factor & ovulation factors have been ruled out.Since you are married for 7 yrs, after this basic evaluation & treatment you can try IUI with good hormonal induction & support.

Progesterone is needed for stabilising the pregnancy after conception. If by any chance the levels of Progesterone are less in the body, then the pregnancy cannot get stabilized and gets aborted before missing a period; which is perceived as no conception. In such cases, this medicine can support stabilizing the pregnancy. I would advise you to get your ovulation monitoring evaluated. If you are releasing the eggs regularly, this medicine will help stabilizing the pregnancy after conception. If you are not ovulating, you may need ovulation induction treatment. Also get your tubal patency evaluated by Hysterosalpingography and Laparoscopy. If there is block, you may need surgical recanalization. Get husband's semen examination done after 4 days of sexual abstinence. I hope both of you get evaluated thoroughly instead of taking any empirical treatment.

As you are trying since 6 months only let me clarify you that chances of being pregnant in each cycle if everything is normal is hardly 10-15 %. As your cycles are pretty regular so mostly you dont have any issue with ovulation. Cerophene basically is an ovulation induction agent that will help to those not ovulating and premarin will cause endometrial lining growth if your lining is not upto appropriate. The symptoms you have told may be a part of PMS & it can never predict pregnancy. I think further plan is basically depends on your age. If You are more than 30 You need to consult your doctor along with your partner to get a baseline evaluation done.

Any external procedure carried out on our body has to be considered seriously and carries a risk of infection. Your fever could be due to any viral or bacterial infection unrelated to the procedure carried out or any mild infection due to embryo transfer which is very unlikely as you don't have any other pelvic symptoms.   You have been advised rightly to take paracetamol to keep your temperature low. Do hydrate yourself well and get plenty of rest.  Regarding your question about chances of conception, there are no direct studies done in humans how fever affects fertilisation and embryo implantation. The animal studies done shows it possibly affects egg and sperms, fertilisation and embryo implantation. With such equivocal evidence, all that one can do is treat fever effectively.

This situation with your mother, is not normal or correct in any sense. This is incest/ sexual abuse.

Although you are a major now, your mother is entirely responsible for this situation. Please try to take some time away and see this for your self. You deserve a life of your own.

The risk of CIN 1 progressing to higher grades is very low which means 6 months is reasonable to wait expecting spontaneous resolution. However , there are two things that need to be discussed here.1. If you wish to have children, you can get screened regularly at 6 monthly intervals until you finish family and opt for treatment later.2. If you think you have completed your family, you can discuss with your doctor for its treatment as the cervical changes are long standing. It depends absolutely on your preference and is validated.3. Your doctor may wish to treat you by laser, cryo, loop excision which will be discussed in detail before procedure.4. There s nothing wrong to wait for 6 more months before treatment.

And if HPV test is positive, as your wife is young, you can expect the infection to fade off in sometime.

Can u please help us out OR give a good gynae address in delhi.","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for writing in. Let me explain you some basics of conception.For conception to take place, three basic things are essential.1. The ovary has to release egg once a month ( ovulation). This is the most important event which regulates your menses or conception. If the egg gets fertilised by sperm following intercourse, one gets pregnant, else the lining of the uterus is shed as menses.2. The fallopian tubes has to be open and functional to allow the transit of sperm and egg towards each other. Doing a tube test (hysterosalpingogram) ll reveal the condition if tubes.3. The semen should contain adequate and good quality sperms.As your periods are irregular and scanty (if that's what you mean by your description) you seem to have ovulatory disturbance and you may need a little help with medication to help you ovulate.   You are on cabgolin and b long f both are used for suppressing prolactin hormone in your body which is elevated. If your prolactin hormone is normal I recommend you to stop it as it doesn't help in anyway.  I would also suggest you to get your thyroid profile (TSH and free T4) done as it causes menstrual problems. If the above mentioned tests are normal you may go ahead and try naturally.

Your are 37 years of age. At this age, the frequency of egg release is rather less and irregular. Moreover, every released egg may not be healthy. 2. To have assured egg release (ovulation), you doctor is giving you Tab. Cerofene, which is clomiphene citrate. This medicines induces ovulation. These tablets should not be taken for more than 6 months. Though the ovulation rate with tablets is good, the pregnancy rate is not that high. After trial of six months if you do not conceive, you may have to change over to HMG/hCG combination. If you are taking these tablets for 5 days from the day 2 of cycle, please subject yourself for ovulation monitoring by ultrasonography from day 9 of the cycle. It will help you to spot the day of ovulation. Then you may plan your intercourse keeping in mind that egg has life of 24 hours and the sperms are active for 72 hours. The eggs released from the follicles of size between 18 mm to 21 mm are the healthiest eggs. Also, it is very important to note the thickness of the uterine lining (endometrium) at the time of ovulation. Endometrium of thickness between 09 to 13 mm is the most conducive endometrium for the implantation of fertilized egg. If your endometrium is remaining thinner, then request your Gynaecologist to work upon increasing endometrial thickness by use of Oestrogenic preparation before induction of ovulation. Clomiphene citrate is known to affect endometrial thickness due to its anti-oestrogenic action. 3. If you have got any reproductory infection, its needs to be cured before you attempt for conception. Infection creates a hostile atmosphere for the sperms. Usually, when women have any infection of reproductory tract, their partners also have it, leading to repeated infections. Hence, it is advised that both of you get the treatment simultaneously. 4. The vaginal wash you are taking with baking soda will create more detrimental atmosphere in the vagina since it is alkaline in nature. If at all you want to have a perineal wash or vaginal douche for healthy vagina, please use some Lactobacilli preparations like Lactacyd. This will help cure the vaginal infections as well as will create a very healthy vaginal environment for the sperms also.  5. Since you already have 2 kids, there should not be any issue with the sperms; however considering the problem you are facing with conception, it is a good idea to get semen examination performed. I hope this should give you sufficient guidance to motivate you to caste a \\"Helpful vote\\" for me. If you want any more information, you may ask me Direct question.

I understand your anxiety. Let me explain you a few things.1. Endometrium acts like soil where embryo gets implanted. The desired endometrial thickness for embryo transfer is at least 8 to 9 mm. Having said that, I would like to add that the blood supply to the endometrium is much more important than thickness alone. This can be found out by using Doppler technique by your sonologist. If your blood supply is fine, and your endometrium is giving a triple line appearance, a thickness at least 6 to 7 mm is acceptable. There are a FEW reports where pregnancy has happened with even 5 mm endometrium.2. Its quite unlikely that endometrium has shrunken unless progesterone has been started after good endometrial growth with estrogen. The thickness is subjected to inter observer and intra observer variability which means there will be a difference of 2 or 3 mm when same person measures at different times or different people measure.3. You may try estrogen gel three times to see if it works better for you after discussing with your doctor. It bypasses liver and makes maximum estrogen available to the endometrium to support its growth.Hope you find this useful. Good luck."},{"Patient":"I have been taking famera for infertility.

Its not quite possible to fix the reason for your intermittent bleeding without doing urine pregnancy test. It may be unlikely if you had good flow for 6 days. But I recommend you to do the home urine pregnancy test with morning urine sample to rule out pregnancy for sure.  If its not pregnancy you can just choose to wait for a few days to see if your bleeding stops. Random menstrual disturbances are not uncommon to find and just letting it settle on its own will do the trick most of the time. If you still continue to bleed or if your UPT comes positive do visit your doctor who may do an ultrasound scan to find the cause for bleeding and evaluate further if needed. Hope this helps.

OVARY AND THE REMAINING ONE IS BLOCKED I DONE 2TIMES IVF BUT SAD SAID NOT SUCCESSFUL ALL FAILED IS THERE ANYN CHANGE FOR ME TO BECOME PREGNANT 1AM NOW 52 YEARS AND NO BABY","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for your query.Preterax doesn't cause infertility. There are few reasons why you are not able to conceive.1. Age is the first and fforemost. Unfortunately, the number of eggs in the ovaries are constant and keeps getting depleted from the time of menarche. At 52 years of age, the number of remaining eggs in the ovary is very very less that even with ivf it is difficult to harvest a good number.  Age also compromises the quality of eggs which is very important for the success of ivf.2. Blocked fallopian tube makes it almost impossible for pregnancy to happen in natural way. Its unfortunate that one of your tube is blocked and the other has been removed.3. In such a scenario, your doctor might have offered embryo donation as an option which you may like to consider if you wish.4. You must also be aware of the possible effects of pregnancy on your health and take caution if pregnancy happens. Hope this helps. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi I m sumaira 34 years old..

I will discuss the issue ina bit details. couple years back i decided to have a baby so me and amy wife started this natural phenomenon of conciving a natural baby. However to our surprise we werent able to do so we decided to consult a gynec and he suggest for detailed siemen analysis. The report was low sperm count at that time 20 Millions .Gynec said we can go ahead and give it a try naturally but obviously we didnt succeed. We were asked to check my PH ,FSH, TH and Testotorne soon after that. The PH and FSH level was very high so my gynec suggested me to go for an MRI. Soon after the MRI i was diagnosed with a micro adenoma which in medical terminology is a Pitutary tumor. I was directed to a endocrinologist and he advised me to have Cabergoline. I was on Cabergoline for almost a year and a half and i had couple if blood test which revelad a PH of 0.6 to 0.6 and FSH was max till 11. I did a siemen anaysis in between as well and it went till 11 millions.i went an urologist as well and and a 3 doppler test done which revealed an 3 mm vericosile.

(just to mention my siemen volume also keeps on flactuatin from 0.8 ml to 2.00 ml 1- Does FSH and PH affects fertility. 2- if yes what is the best medicine for it. 3- i had been on Fertil M medication which has shown significant improvement. Any suggestion on this. 4-does Vericocile affects fertility. If yes what is the medical treatment. Lastly i am now very confused and dont know the future course of action and line of treatment. Can anyone suggest me a way out of this confusion please.","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for the query. I understand your confusion regarding the endocrine orchestra. Let's try to sort one by one.Firstly it would have been great and could have helped to draw a line of management if you provided few more details likeA. Duration of your married lifeB. How long have you been tryingC. Your job natureD. Your thyroid hormone, testosterone levels.Coming to your questions, I can suggest you these things based on the available information.1. Prolactin is an important hormone that affects fertility and fortunately this cause is easily correctable by drugs which can normalise sperm count and motility. An increase in prolactin causes decrease in sperm count, motility and quality. It reduces testosterone (male hormone) levels as well.   I see that your prolactin has been adequately treated and you have stopped it three months ago. But your sperm count is at 6 million recently which is low and cannot be reasoned accurately without evaluating in depth. Unfortunately, male factors like oligospermia (low sperm count) are difficult to treat and intrauterine insemination (iui) where good quality sperms are separated in adequate numbers and are injected directly into the uterus, is tried as treatment method to aid conception.2. Your FSH is at the higher end of normal range and difficult to remark as I don't have your testosterone levels available. It varies in response to other hormonal levels like prolactin and testosterone.3.Fertyl M works by increasing FSH which augments sperm count. As your FSH is normal, its unlikely to help you significantly.4. Your varicocele is currently mild and doesn't require a surgery. Wearing cotton and comfortable undergarments, quitting alcohol and smoking if you are used to, helps. Nothing needs to be done for varicocele as of now. Vitamin A, E and C supplements enhance sperm qualby working as antioxidants.5. To know the best line of action your partner needs to get few tests to know if she s ovulating and if her fallopian tubes (hysterosalpingogram) are good. If yes, you can try iui for 4 to 6 cycles provided your processed semen count is preferably 5 million.Hope you have been answered satisfactorily. Good luck."},{"Patient":"I have failed ICSI treatment?? Reason stated were there could be possible kochs still present after 8 months of ATT treatment in the past with AKT3. Now physician again putting me on AKT4 excempting ethambutol as i have reaction to this drug. Is it suggestable to go again with AKT4 along with DHEAPREG for ovarian reserve at the same time as AMH value is 2.9. OB/GYN says to continue this for three months and then go for laparoscopy to check for any healing. Please suggest is okay to go before i go forward with another cycle of ICSI or try naturally as suggested by second opinion when there is no problem with tubes and uterus there are also chances to conceive during this treatment.... Please suggest.","Doctor":"Semen ello, Thanks for writing in. Let me answer your basic concern first.      A.I don't think you need to be treated for Koch's for the second time just on presumption that the disease may still be persisting. Currently there are no proper set of guidelines to dictate when genital Koch's has to be treated. As lot of tests used for diagnosis indicate only presence of bacteria but not an ONGOING INFECTION which is very important to differentiate. So I recommend you to not opt for it unless 1. Your RNA PCR for kochs in endometrial sample comes positive.2.There is direct evidence of Koch's on hysteria laparoscopy which your doctor will let you know.3. TB bacteria is seen on histopathology slide made from endometrial biopsy sample.Other tests done for Koch's should only support diagnosis but should not be the basis for unnecessary treatment.   B. I would also suggest you to not take DHEA preg as it is meant for women with very low ovarian reserve. Your AMH value which talks about your ovarian reserve is well above 2 meaning you have good number of eggs in your ovaries.  C.Its difficult to opine regarding your chances of natural conception as you haven't mentioned your age and duration of infertility, semen report, indication for icsi, tubal function test report and other relevant information in your query.But if your tubes are fine and no ovulatory problem , semen analysis is normal, and if you are trying for less than 2 or 3 years you may try another 6 months. You may conceive naturally even without treatment but it may take few months to many years which can't be predicted.Hope this helps.

Few things you have mentioned here is reassuring. Firstly, you already have a child from natural conception.Secondly, your tubes are functioning fine and the inner lining of uterus (endometrium ) and cavity look fine. And there are no other issues on hysteria laparoscopy. Rather terming this scenario as secondary infertility I would just call it subfertility which means the ability to conceive naturally in on the lower end of time frame needed for conception. In simple words, it may just take a little more than longer for you to conceive on your own.   Having said that, if you are past 30 years of age and have been trying for more than 2 years, I recommend you to opt for ovulation induction drugs with intra uterine insemination to help you increase your chances of conception.    Delayed periods once in a while are not concern  If you are a previously regularly menstruating woman. You can choose to wait for 10 more days for your periods or take Tab.Regesterone 5mg twice daily for 5 days. Periods are expected to happen 2 to 7 days once you stop medication.

I have visited doctor at second day of my period and he has done a scan on my whom and ovaries. And suggested to visit again at 12th day of my period for checkup and he said that tranfer will be on 15th-16th day of period. i would like to know that in this case what is meaning of ERA because earlier in 2 cycle they have transfered on 15th or 16th day so what is meaning of ERA. And i want to know that what should be the uterus size before transfer and miprogen or progaynova is useful to increase size of uterus please answer as soon as possible","Doctor":"Hello there, Thanks for writing in. I learnt from your writing that you have so far undergone 4 ivf cycles which were unsuccessful. Let me help you understand in this scenario the meaning of 'implantation failure'.   When pregnancy test comes negative in two or more ivf cycles where 6 or more reasonably good quality embryos are transferred then it is assumed to be implantation failure which means the embryo has failed to get burried in the soil(which is endometrium). When the embryo is transferred,  the endometrium needs to receive it with the help of finger like microscopic structures to help it get burried . And the endometrium can do it only within a very short time frame, usually 6 to 7days post ovulation. Sometimes this timeframe within which it can receive seems to be shifted either early in the cycle or later. By doing an ERA(Endometrium receptivity array) test we are able to predict this timeframe much precisely so that the embryo transfer can be timed accordingly.  2. The size of the uterus doesn't matter for pregnancy unless its extremely small. 3. Progynova is not being used for increasing the size of uterus.Hope your question is satisfactorily answered. Good luck."},{"Patient":"Hello, We recently learned that my husband had zero sperm in his ejaculate during a recent sperm analysis. The doctor suggested he do blood work and see a Urologist to learn more however a few days later and a week stay in the hospital we learned my husband endured a Pulmonary Embolism.

Also, does Coumadin have any male fertility/infertility history? Thank you in advance!","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for the query. First of all there can't be any possible relationship between pulmonary embolism and lack of sperms in semen as the blood clots won't affect blood supply to the testes.

(Nov - feb) Later in March Dr suggested to do Laproscopy (done in April) after which she asked us to take a break for 2 months. In July, Aug and Sep we did IUI (Siphene + Folligraf injection + Siphasi 10000 iu) but no positive response, for October and November it was a break time again as the endo lining was not shedding properly.

Are we on the right track and why there is no outcome till now. what is the possibility with the change of medicine. what are the chances of getting positive result. else the doctors have told to move on to IVF. Please suggest a remedy or solution.","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for the query. I understand your disappointment regarding unsuccessful treatment so far. Let me guide you through treatment and success rates.  It helps if you understand the chances of pregnancy around the time of ovulation by natural method is only 8 to 10% per cycle.   This pregnancy rate is increased to 12 to 15% per cycle when medication is used to get more than one egg in a cycle ( superovulation) which is again combined with iui. At least 50% of the people will be able to conceive by the end of 4 cycles of iui failing which the chances of conception in further cycles of iui is not any higher than before. And hence its not advisable to continue iui cycles for more than 6 cycles.  Ivf can come up as next best available option as it allows to harvest multiple eggs and freeze excess embryos. It also allows your doctor to evaluate the quality of eggs and embryo and transfer it to the uterus. The chances of conception in an ivf cycle can be 45 to 50%. You have seemingly followed right steps. Good luck with your treatment."},{"Patient":"I am under IVF w/ ICSI Fertility treatment. I had 3 PGD tested Normal embryos.

Any pregnancy detected by doing beta hcg but not evident on scan is biochemical pregnancy. Yes, this could be a chemical pregnancy as you mentioned. The likelihood of continuation of pregnancy depends on the serial nearly doubling values of beta hcg every 48 hours rather than a single value. Having said that beta hcg of about 11.7 is interpreted as a low value to expect a marked rise on the next testing and to witness a clinical pregnancy except in extremely rare situations. But clinicians do want to wait and see to give it a benefit of doubt. Hope your concern is addressed satisfactorily.

Let me help you understand few things.1. As you mentioned about your 8 cm right ovarian simple cyst is unlikely to resolve on its own as its size is bigger and it may need to be removed surgically. You may try to get ovarian drilling( about 4 punctures on each ovary) at the same time to help you ovulate( egg release process) regularly.2. Neodipar (metformin) is currently recommended in women who have intolerance to glucose (prediabetic like state) . But as you seem to be amenorrhoeic for a long time it helps if you continue it. For best results you need to maintain your weight by diet and exercise if you are on heavier side.3. If you are planning conception your doctor may suggest you ovulation induction drugs to help you release egg and conceive.4. Diane 35 will help you with acne but prevents pregnancy.5. For resuming your periods you may take T. Regesterone 5mg twice daily for 5 days . you can expect your periods once you discontinue medication. Hope this helps.

I am very confused of the results and what to do or expect","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for your query. Your question suggests me few things.1. The fact that beta hcg is positive tells that implantation has happened which means to say the embryo has embedded in the uterine lining that is endometrium.2. Any pregnancy that shows up as beta hcg positive(above 5) but is not evident in ultrasound even by more than 2 weeks post transfer is called biochemical pregnancy which you are experiencing now.3. The ultimate fate of such a pregnancy can be two things- a failing intrauterine pregnancy or an ectopic pregnancy. But in your case it looks quite unlikely for the pregnancy to continue. But the chances that it can be ectopic is extremely small. Sometimes it can happen that even though embryo has grown till day 5 its ability to continue to grow in the womb is compromised. So it results in biochemical pregnancy. But it's tells you have a fairly good chance of conception through ivf next time due to positive implantation.   You can now wait for another beta hcg result as your doc suggests and if no good rise, your doc may ask you to stop medication and follow up your beta hcg levels or wait for your periods to resume whichever is the earliest.

But having said that desire to parent a child needs a great deal of commitment and motivation from your side. Please have patience and take care of yourself before attempting for another time.  I assume you were suggested ivf when your DNA PCR test results were positive and does your tube test( hysterosalpingogram) reveal blocked tubes? If the answer to these two questions is yes, there are few things I would like to tell you.1. DNA PCR does not reflect an ongoing TB infection in the uterus. It is more appropriate to treat when RNA PCR comes positive. But the facility to test RNA PCR is not available everywhere. Having said it is very important to finish entire course of anti TB medication as discontinuation leads to drug resistance which is a public menace and for you as well.2. Secondly, did you mean you didn't undergo ovum pick up due to typhoid fever or is it embryo transfer. If its egg pick up, nothing can be done but you need to undergo another ivf. If it is embryo transfer and embryos are frozen, you can undergo frozen embryo transfer anytime after your endometrium is ready either naturally or with medication.3. If your tubes are open, you can consider iui for 3 more cycles if your husband's semen analysis is normal.4.

There are few things I would like to suggest.1. When we do follicular scan we can assess ovulation by noting that the follicle has collapsed and not visible and the fluid inside bthe follicle can sometimes be seen in the pelvis on scan. At times the follicle gets filled with blood and other tissues that it becomes difficult to know if ovulation has occurred. A good sonologist makes use of other techniques like Doppler to assess ovulation. Having said that its not always possible to tell certainly if the egg has been effectively released which applies to your scenario as well. But the possility of pregnancy cannot be negated.2. Current evidence suggests in endometriosis of stage 1 and 2, mild, if the fallopian tubes are open ,best results are obtained when ovulation is achieved by gonadotropins (injections for achieving many follicles) and combining with intra uterine insemination provided your husband's semen is normal.3. Make sure your fallopian tubes are open by getting tube test done. (Hysterosalpingogram). This is necessary for iui. Please remember in fertility issues we only talk about probability and likelihood.

I m from India Bangalore, but now I have come to London for the last 2 months. I m married for almost 1 1/2 year. My husband and me have been desperately trying for a child, but in vain. In 2008, I was hospitalized for food poison and the doctor told me to take a scan, only then did the doctor say that I have PCOS. The doctor suggested me to meet a gynecologist. I immediately met Dr Shanta, who is a gynecologist in Chennai (My aunt s friend), She explained what PCOS is and started off with my treatment immediately, She gave me MEPRATE & GLYSOFATE (I m not too sure about the spelling) and she told me to do a lot of exercise and walking as my weight was 72 kgs then and my age was 28. Till then my cycles were regular I got married in December 2008, I did not get my periods at all that month. I got it on 14th Jan 2009, My first cycle after marriage, And I had terrible stomach pain. So my husband s granny gave me some herbal leaves to take to avoid this stomach pain, It was a normal cycle for 5 days, and I took this herbal leaves only for the first 3 days. Again I did not get my cycle in the month of February. I was wondering what could be wrong with me, So i told my husband that we need to see a Gyno, In the mean time I had also told what Dr Shanta had told about PCOS. So we went to Apollo Dignostic and got a complete master health check up done for my husband and me. After the reports came the doctor said that my husband is in the initial stage of Diabetes. As the sugar level was high, his urine & semen report was also not proper, We were asked to meet the Sr. Doctor in the same hospital. We had to again explain everything to that doctor, and also told her about my irregular cycles. She suggested that she does not handle all this as she is just a general physician so she suggested us to go to ANKUR FERTILITY and get a semen analysis done, I suggested my husband that we shall go to Dr Shanta itself but since we came to know that he has diabetic now and we were married for only 3 months then and Dr shanta is a very good friend of my aunt so he was not willing to come there. We had no choice but to go to ANKUR, we got the semen analysis done and the doctor said that his sperm count is very less. Then they told us about the treatment, that I need to get treated for my cycles to get regular and my husband for his sperm count to increase, Then the doctor told she has to do a IVF for us. For which my husband was not OK with it. His sugar level started increasing more and every times when ever we used to have an intercourse I used to have infection, Even he was undergoing terrible pain, We stopped going even to ANKUR, We were going to a local nursing house in our area, and that doctor had give heavy dose, so there was bleeding in his penis, then that doctor told my husband to do a circumsection. Then we took a second option from a doctor who is a Sr Doctor in Diabetes and that doctor told us not to get into all this, she prescribed GLOCONORM - G for my husband by the time all this happened it was in the month of September, In October my husband flew to London as he got his job here. Even I started taking treatment from Dr Kamalini who is a mother and child care specialist in a nursing home near my house and she prescribed for me FOLININE, CHROMINA - A (1) EVERDAY, ROSINORM - M (1-0-1) EVERDAY for PCOS, and to get my cycles regular DUPHASTON for 5 days. Now I have been taking this tablets from the month of November till date. I came to London 2 months back now my husbands sugar has come to normal it is 80 - 90 before fast and 110 - 120 after fast and after 1 month of intercourse my husband and me checked in the pregnancy kit, but still it is showing negative, We are very very disappointed and upset with this, and because of this now and then we are having small fights at home. Everybody has now started questioning me why still I m unable to get pregnant. Which make me feel very unsecured. Doctor can you please help me out with this, Is there any chance that I can get pregnant soon. I m very desperate and have lost my patience now, cause my friends who were married after me have conceived by now and are in their 4 month and 5 month, and I m feeling so bad that I m still not able to and even my age is passing, Please suggest me how do I get pregnant soon and come out of it.

I did the testicular biopsy and they found sperm, thank God. They took 7 samples from the right testes only 4 of which contained 300,000 sperms and 2 of which contained 1 million sperms but the motility is 1% the 7th sample was sent to the pathology to be examined and the following was concluded from the test: Microscopic Picture: Serial sections examined from the testicular biopsy revealed within normal size seminiferous tubules. The tubules were populated by germ cells. Most of the tubules showed spermatozoa. Sertoli cells lining was intact and showed no abnormality. The basement membrane was thickened. Leydig cell population was within normal. No evidence of granuloma, specific infection or neoplasia in the specimen received.

Q2 one of the doctors told me that due to the obstruction or blockage the sperms age and die and their motility and vitality is affected. Is this a fact?

My problems are: 1) i never attain orgasm during sex even after 15-20 min,though my husband attains. but i always attain orgasm if i masturbate. -Is this a problem with me or my husband fails to stimulate me? -though i don t attain orgasm with him,i feel satisfied and it gives me a pleasure.but Can i get pregnant only if i attain orgasm? 2) my cycles are mostly regular-30 to 32 days(since i attained menarche),normal flow,no dysmenorrhea.Occasionally when i am deeply emotionally stressed periods gets delayed further by 2 or 3 days,but never more than 35 days.all my cycles are initially slightly painful(not severe dysmenorrhea).i have mid cycle pain,irritability and breast tenderness just before my periods. -am i suffering from PMS? - can i assume that i am ovulating because of all these?or should i get tests done? -it has been just two months since we are planning for a baby.so should i wait more or can we consult a doctor after a month,since it is one year after marriage? THANK YOU","Doctor":"Higreetings. you are absolutely normal as far sex is concerned. There are more than 40 %of women who will not get orgasam during intercourse and they need to be stimulated.You both can involve in foreplay for more than 15 to 20 min and masterbating by clitorial stimulation will definitely reach orgasam for you.since females can have multiple orgasam intercourse can be immediately followed by your orgasam. So that both of you will be satisfied.coming to fertility.your husband can get a semen analysis done from a very good laboratory who are familiar with semen analysis as there are lots off fallacies with semen analysis.If it is normal you should be having daily intercourse from 10 the day of your cycle for 10 to 12 days continuously. usually ovulation happens 14 days prior to expected date of menses if your cycles are regular. since it cannot be predicted it is better to start intercourse from 10th day.You can try for 3 months like this if semen analysis is normal. still no pregnancy it is better to get it evaluated. day 2 hormone analysis ,ultrasound scan etc .hope you are convinced.

Im having normal periods and was advised for an IUI. My lh level was 11. So im advised to take duoluton tablet. I took 3 tablets for 3 days n I stopped it. 10 th day I have my periods again. Do I need to take hormone test tomorrow 2nd day. My husband has low sperm count and motility. Im very much afraid of my very soon periods.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear Arulmozhi,From your history, it appears that your main concern now is additional periods you had. You had taken Tab. Duoluton for 3 days. Duoluton is Progesterone preparation. Progesterone causes secretory changes in the lining of uterus (endometrium). After 3 days you discontinued Duoluton; hence you were expected to get the withdrawal bleeding after 4-7 days, which you got. In fact if you are to be put on Progestational medicine for the support throughout the cycle, I would advise you to go for retroprogesterone preparations throughout the cycle so that they would not hamper egg release. If you discontinue these medicines in between, you will get withdrawal bleeding. Now as far as the low sperm count of your husband is concerned, your doctors have suggested you and taken the decision of IUI which you should follow. Please start ultrasonography ovulation monitoring. When the follicle is between 18 mm to 21 mm size AND the endometrial thickness is between 9 mm to 14 mm, it is the most ideal time for IUI. So follow these instructions. You need not be afraid for that additional 'period' since it was due to discontinuation of Duoluton. I hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"hi!

But I am mentally prepare for pregnancy please suggest me other way to reduce my pain and increase chances of conceiving. As I am planning to get pregnant after 1 yr","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. I understand your concern. Adenomyosis is a condition in which the inner lining of the uterus (the endometrium) breaks through the muscle wall of the uterus (the myometrium). It causes uterus to become two or three times larger than normal. In addition, adenomyosis can cause problems with infertility. Before you can begin adenomyosis infertility treatment, the following tests needs to be done, which includes:1. Blood work2. Pelvic exam and ultrasound scan3. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The following treatments may help reduce your adenomyosis symptoms, increasing your chances of becoming pregnant:1. Birth control pills2. Intrauterine devices (IUD)3. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonistsSome women will be able to conceive within a few months after completing these hormonal therapies. If these treatments don't help, you need to go for invitro fertilization (IVF) treatment to help you get pregnant. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best."},{"Patient":"Hi, We are trying for a baby for last 1 yr. But as of now nothing positive. I had a history of endometriotic cyst. I had gone through an operation almost 9 yrs back.

I understand your concern. Trying to conceive for more than a year with reports indicating normal could be due to secondary infertility. Both male factor and female factor needs to be clinically evaluated along with the investigations to know what could be the cause for the delay in conceiving. You can consult Infertility specialist in this regard in any of the corporate hospitals or Infertility hospitals in Bangalore to get a proper check-up and management.

Kindly help me out, why both the tab i m taking.","Doctor":"Hi there,Welcome to HCM,Since you are trying to conceive for 1 year and have not been able to, you and your partner both need to be evaluated. Since you do not suffer from PCOS there is no need for you to undergo follicular monitooring and ovulation induction using Siphene. Moreover the minimum dose of Clomiphene (Siphene) to be taken is 50 mg per day not 25 mg.Also, Cabgolin is used in prolactin excess, it should not be given empirically unless prolactin levels are done and they show abnormality .So please get yourself evaluated before taking treatment and do not take treatment without finding the cause of infertility.Take folic acid 400 micrograms which is given for fetal brain and spinal cord development while trying to conceive, it prevents birth defects in babies.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am married for 5 years and planning for a baby. I had irregular menstrual cycle and visited a Gynecologist in a local clinic. I am undergoing treatment from 8 months and now menstrual cycle is regularized, however not conceived yet. Doctor prescribed to take Gestmate 200, Natural Micronised Progesterone Soft Gelatin Capsules. I am little confused about its side effect and its preventing me from getting pregnant. Please let me know if I can continue taking it.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. I understand your concern. Gestmate belongs to a class of hormones called progestogens, which is a C-21 steroid hormone involved in the female menstrual cycle, supports gestation and embryogenesis of humans. Progersterone also does the same function, which helps the implantation of fertilized ovum and further carrying pregnancy further. One of the reason why you might be still having delay in conceiving despite taking these medicines could be issues related to the following: 1. Patency of Fallopian tubes, which needs to be assessed by 'Hysterosalpingography'. 2. Status of the ovary and timing of ovulation by doing follicular studies. 3. Semen analysis of your partner. Kindly consult Infertility specialists with the reports after undergoing the above tests for proper evaluation and management. Hope the information provided would be helpful.

I understand your concern. If HSG report and your husband's semen analysis is normal, then what needs to be done is to time properly by means of ovulation study.

She s saying that the semen sample I gave was stinky. I ve some questions regarding this matter. 1) Does semen being stinky affect the fertilization? 2) They retrieved 8 eggs from my wife and with my stinky semen produced 5 good embryos (3 with 8 cells and 2 with 7 cells). Since 5 embryos were produced it seems the stinkyness of the semen has no effect? 3) They wash the semen and said the movement of sperms were good before doing the fertilization so I don t understand that now they say everything else was good both partners weren t sick during the transfer and all went well except the semen sample I gave was stinky. I don t believe their reasonning and let me to think that they are looking for excuses. 4) Just up to 3 days before producing my semen sample, due to a dental treatment I was taking an antibiotic capsule for 7 days and I m wondering that was the only difference compare to previous sampling. Just couple of months before the treatment started I gave a sample for analysis and told all good and I didn t drink coffee or anything that would affect the semen for a month until the transfer is over.

I'm from India Bangalore, but now I have come to London for the last 2 months. I'm married for almost 1 1/2 year. My husband and me have been desperately trying for a child, but in vain. In 2008, I was hospitalized for food poison and the doctor told me to take a scan, only then did the doctor say that I have PCOS. The doctor suggested me to meet a gynecologist. I immediately met Dr Shanta, who is a gynecologist in Chennai (My aunt's friend), She explained what PCOS is and started off with my treatment immediately, She gave me MEPRATE & GLYSOFATE (I'm not too sure about the spelling) and she told me to do a lot of exercise and walking as my weight was 72 kgs then and my age was 28. Till then my cycles were regular I got married in December 2008, I did not get my periods at all that month. I got it on 14th Jan 2009, My first cycle after marriage, And I had terrible stomach pain. So my husband's granny gave me some herbal leaves to take to avoid this stomach pain, It was a normal cycle for 5 days, and I took this herbal leaves only for the first 3 days. Again I did not get my cycle in the month of February. I was wondering what could be wrong with me, So i told my husband that we need to see a Gyno, In the mean time I had also told what Dr Shanta had told about PCOS. So we went to Apollo Dignostic  and got a complete master health check up done for my husband and me. After the reports came the doctor said that my husband is in the initial stage of Diabetes. As the sugar level was high, his urine & semen report was also not proper, We were asked to meet the Sr. Doctor in the same hospital. We had to again explain everything to that doctor, and also told her about my irregular cycles. She suggested that she does not handle all this as she is just a general physician so she suggested us to go to ANKUR FERTILITY and get a semen analysis done, I suggested my husband that we shall go to Dr Shanta itself but since we came to know that he has diabetic now and we were married for only 3 months then and Dr shanta is a very good friend of my aunt so he was not willing to come there. We had no choice but to go to ANKUR, we got the semen analysis done and the doctor said that his sperm count is very less. Then they told us about the treatment, that I need to get treated for my cycles to get regular and my husband for his sperm count to increase, Then the doctor told she has to do a IVF for us. For which my husband was not OK with it. His sugar level started increasing more and every times when ever we used to have an intercourse I used to have infection, Even he was undergoing terrible pain, We stopped going even to ANKUR, We were going to a local nursing house in our area, and that doctor had give heavy dose, so there was bleeding in his penis, then that doctor told my husband to do a circumsection. Then we took a second option from a doctor who is a Sr Doctor in Diabetes  and that doctor told us not to get into all this, she prescribed GLOCONORM - G for my husband by the time all this happened it was in the month of September, In October my husband flew to London as he got his job here. Even I started taking treatment from Dr Kamalini who is a mother and child care specialist in a nursing home near my house and she prescribed for me FOLININE, CHROMINA - A (1) EVERDAY, ROSINORM - M (1-0-1) EVERDAY for PCOS, and to get my cycles regular DUPHASTON for 5 days. Now I have been taking this tablets from the month of November till date. I came to London 2 months back now my husbands sugar has come to normal it is 80 - 90 before fast and 110 - 120 after fast and after 1 month of intercourse my husband and me checked  in the pregnancy kit, but still it is showing negative, We are very very disappointed and upset with this, and because of this now and then we are having small fights at home. Everybody has now started questioning me why still I'm unable to get pregnant. Which make me feel very unsecured. Doctor can you please help me out with this, Is there any chance that I can get pregnant soon. I'm very desperate and have lost my patience now, cause my friends who were married after me have conceived by now and are in their 4 month and 5 month, and I'm feeling so bad that I'm still not able to and even my age is passing, Please suggest me how do I get pregnant soon and come out of it.

Thank You very much.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,You have spelt out your diagnosis as informed to you by your Doctor; i.e. PCOS. PCOS is a complex dysfunction in the body. What previously was thought as only ovarian dysfunction, is now found to be working at three different functions: Ovulatory, Metabolic and Hormonal. It is anovulation at ovaries leading to menstrual irregularities and infertility, hyperinsulinism due to tissues insensitivity to insulin and hyperandrogenism.  To manage PCOS, all these three levels have to be targeted. All these together lead to irregular delayed menses with anovulation with infertility, obesity, hair growth at unwanted and abnormal places in the female; i.e. face, chest, abdomen, coarse hair on legs, etc. The classic feature of fat deposition is in the abdominal region and hence abdomen:waist ratio goes on increasing. For ovulation purpose, different medicines like Clomiphene citrate, gonadotrophin hormones with hCG are tried and have proved to be fairly successful. Along with medicines for ovulation, to control obesity, high protein, moderate carbohydrates and low fat diet with exercises is advocated. Metformin tablets help controlling hyperinsulinism. So I would suggest you to control weight and continue with Clomiphene citrate that you are receiving for maximum 6 months . If Clomiphene citrate fails, your doctor will have to shift to gonadotrophins (HMG+hCG regimen). It is always advisable to monitor ovulation and endometrial thickness while on the treatment for ovulation induction. The follicles which ovulate between 18 mm to 21 mm size release healthiest eggs and have better chances of conception. Also, for successful implantation of fertilized ovum, the endometrial thickness between 9 mm to 13 mm is very conducive. Thus, artificial ovulation may be planned accordingly, if needed. If natural conception even after induction of ovulation fails, you may have to go for Artificial Reproductory Techniques like Intrauterine insemination, In vitro fertilization and Embryo transfer, etc. I am not a homeopath and hence would prefer not to comment on homeopathic management of PCOS. However, please do not discontinue the allopathic treatment. I hope you remain adherent to the treatment to get the success.

Me & My wife SHIKHA SHARMA are planning to have IVF from Dr.Swarnkar. Patient is 35 yrs old elder primigravida.Had a missed abortion 3 yrs back of 2 months.DNC was done in udaipur.RIght frm then she had scanty periods fr 3 yrs. We consulted with Dr.Arun Gupta in udaipur n underwent the treatment for six months.But the periods were still not proper. 6 months back she underwent hysteroscopy in which a septum was revealed in the anterior wall of uterus.The septum was large enough, so it was removed in front of me & multiload was intalled for 2 months. she was under medication of EVADIOL & DUPHASTON & GYARGIN sachet as the endometrial blood flow was not normal as revealed in TVS. One month back multiload was removed & she is following the same medication.Recent cycle was for 2 days only.Please suggest as soon as we can undergo IVF from DR.SWARNKAR.","Doctor":"Hallow Dr. Ravindra,From your history I have understood that the cause for Mrs. Shikha's abortion was intrauterine septum. Now that is removed. However, with all the surgical interventions she has undergone (including D&C), it seems that her endometrium is damaged and has become very thin. This is known as Aschermann's Syndrome, wherein there are adhesions in the utrerine cavity. She had Multiload in her uterine cavity to keep both the walls of the uterus apart and facilitate the healing. Oestrogen preparations are given to facilitate endometrial growth. . Many reports in the literature inform us that endometrium between 9 mm to 13 mm with triple line appearance are conducive for implantation of the blastocyst (fertilized ovum). Hence, before you attempt any IVF, please undergo ultrasonography to find out the endometrial thickness. From your history it appears that endometrium is not well built up as yet. I would suggest you to wait till endometrium attains thickness of at least 9 mm before you attempt IVF. For taking care of synachae,  continue with Multiload. For endometrial growth, take oestrogen preparations only (without any progesterone) for continuous 3 months without any cyclical break. Thus she should not have menses for three months. Monitor the treatment at monthly interval by ultrasonography to find out the endometrial growth. Once the endometrium is built up to 9 mm in thickness with triple line appearance, you can attempt pregnancy. In fact, her previous pregnancy was a natural pregnancy. Now you are finding difficulty in conception due to thin endometrium. So I feel, once the endometrium is built up,  she may conceive naturally also. However, considering her age, she may have low oocyte reserve left in her ovaries. Hence, you may not give trial for natural conception very long. I would suggest you following:1. While her endometrium is getting built up, monitor her ovulation by ultrasonography. If she is ovulating normally, you may attempt natural pregnancy by planning your intercourses on and around the day of ovulation. 2. If it fails, you may opt for Intrauterine insemination for 3-6 months. 3. If that also fails, then you may think of IVF & ET. After conception due to any method, please support the pregnancy by hCG and/or Progesterone. However, this all is after the endometrium is well built, between 9-14 mm. So my answer to your query in one line would be not to attempt any method of conception till the endometrium is not 9 mm thick.

Yes, it is possible that some women do not respond to Goodova (Clomiphene), these could be due to Clomiphene resistance or improper use.If you have been diagnosed with PCOS delayed periods and anovulation are common and it could be due to the same that you have not yet got your period.You need to get proper medication for PCOS, Metformin 500 mg twice a day is advisable and can be continued even when you get pregnant. It is not advisable to take thyroid tablets unless you have a documented thyroid deficiency, it will not help you to take it randomly.Diet, exercise and Metformin will help you with the PCOS. For ovulation induction with Clomiphene you need to take Clomiphene from day 2 to day 7 of the cycle and under go follicular monitoring from day 9 of the cycle to track the ovulation.Also Folic acid should be taken by any women trying to conceive. You could take Duphaston to get your period and start Clomiphene from day 2, after confirming with another pregnant test that you are definitely not pregnant.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"if your late for depo provera shot and start spotting, does this mean you are fertile?

Further more you are using lutinus vaginal pessaries also, which again are progesterone. Progesterone is smooth muscle relaxant and thus relaxes even the blood vessels. Therefore drop in blood pressure after progesterone injection (and vaginal pessaries in addition) is a known side effect.  It is most likely that your blood pressure is getting lowered which causes hot flushes and sweating at night. Please take your Gynaecologist's opinion. If it is not alarming, please continue taking Gestone and lutinus since Progesterone helps to stabilize the pregnancy. Since you are on ICSI treatment, doctors are taking all the precautions to support your pregnancy and minimize the chances of any abortion. Your previous pregnancies were not supported by Gestone and they unfortunately ended in abortion. Therefore, this time the doctors have taken additional preventive precaution by giving Gestone to prevent the possibility of abortion. I hope Gestone and lutinus will work to stabilize your pregnancy and you will have a bonny baby to breastfeed at the end of the term.

I would like to get married and have a child but at the moment it seems impossible. I ve seen many specialists but none seem t know what s wrong. Something is wrong with my reproductive sytem. I suffered from a brain tumor at the age of 2","Doctor":"Hello, It is a shame that your physicians do not seem to be able to adequately explain to you why you do not menstruate. It is possible, through a combination of diagnostic tests (hormone levels, diagnostic studies such as an MRI of your brain, and an ultrasound to evaluate the organs of your pelvis) to obtain an accurate diagnosis.In order to develop sexually and menstruate normally woman or girl must have five organs of the body that develop normally and function properly; it includes the hypothalamus of the brain, the pituitary gland, which is located below your brainstem, and then your reproductive organs themselves: your uterus, vagina, and ovaries. Abnormalities of function in any of these organs can prevent a woman from being able to menstruate.If you developed normally as a young girl, meaning that you grew breasts, underarm hair, and pubic hair without taking hormones suggest that your brain tumor was not the cause of your inability to menstruate. Furthermore, if your pituitary gland were the source of the problem, you most likely would've needed other types of medication to treat other hormonal abnormalities, such as your thyroid function, during childhood as well.So at this point, if you have never menstruated, there is a possibility that you may have an abnormality of your ovaries, or even your uterus or vagina. Imaging studies such as an MRI or even ultrasound of your pelvis can make sure that you have all your required reproductive organs and they are connected to each other properly. Some women may be born without a uterus, or with a blockage between the uterus and the outside of the vagina which prevents menstrual flow from leaving the body.Another way that it can be tested if your reproductive organs work is to give you some hormonal medication, like birth control pills, which will make a woman have regular periods as long as she has a functioning uterus and vagina. If they were, it means that you have all the required parts for menstruation and that it is a hormonal problem.A specialist called a reproductive endocrinologist is a kind of gynecologist doctor who specifically studies hormones, both to help women achieve pregnancy as well is treat other hormonal health conditions of women. I strongly suggest that you consult with a specialist in this area as I truly believe that that type of specialist should be able to get you the information that you need and help you conceive if it is physically possible for you.Hope I have answered your query.

Establish the egg release (Ovulation): It can be done bya. Study of the uterine lining by hysteromicroscopy just before the menses.b. Ultrasonography ovulation monitoring: It will even help to locate the day of ovulation and thus you can plan the intercourse accordingly.c. Ovulation monitoring kit.d. Study of the hormones like FSH, LH, prolactin in the blood.2. Find out the patency of woman's genital tract. For this information:a. Hysterosalpingography: X-ray of the uterus after filling in the radio-opaque dye.b. Laparoscopy: It will give the information about the normalcy of the genital organs and any other relevant information from the pelvis.3. Semen examination after four days abstinence.Once all this information is available, further planning of the management can be done.Currently, most of the medicines Mrs. Arpita is receiving are to induce the ovulation. Their need can be opined only after seeing all the reports. Please visit a gynecologist and get all these investigations done. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards, Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I am a 21 year old female and my partner is 36 years old. We are trying for a baby but nothing has happened yet.

Is there is any chance for miscarriage if any there is conceive ?","Doctor":"Homeopathic Remedies for Urinary Bladder InfectionsHomeopathy treats patients on every level, addressing the emotional, physical, and mental state of the patient. Each treatment is highly individualized to the symptoms of the illness and the personal characteristics of the patient. The most common remedies for urinary bladder infections are outlined below. These remedies are designed to relieve acute episodes, and are especially useful for chronic problems.When the patient feels anxious both before and during urination, with scanty, hot urine and a burning or spasmodic sensation in the bladder outlet, Aconitum apellus is often useful.When the person frequently needs to urinate, but only small quantities are passed; when stinging and burning sensations are felt, especially with the last few drops; and there might be soreness in the abdomen, Apis mellifica might provide relief.If a cramping or writhing sensation is felt in the bladder area, the bladder feels very sensitive, the patient experiences frequent and intense urges to urinate, and small amounts of highly colored urine are passed a homeopath might suggest Belladonna.When there is inflammation of the bladder experienced as twinges of cutting pain; a burning sensation that extends to the urethra and its opening, even when no attempt at urination is being made; and after emptying the bladder, the person feels as if some urine still remains inside, a homeopath might prefer Berberis vulgaris.When there is a strong urge to urinate; cutting pains that are felt before, during, and after the urine passes; only several drops pass at a time, with a scalding sensation; and a feeling that the bladder has not been emptied, the homeopath may suggest Cantharis.For inflammation of the bladder that aches, with smarting pain in the urinary opening and a feeling that the urine is retained, Borax is often indicated.When the patient feels a troublesome urge to urinate, but with a need to strain or even stand up and lean forward to make urine pass, Chimaphila umbellate might help.When a person must urinate frequently, feels constriction in the urinary passage, has an interrupted flow, only passes a small amount, dribbles afterward, and experiences a tingling sensation long after urination is finished, the solution might be Clematis.If an inflamed bladder has a dull but distressing pain and feels full even after urinating, with a greater sense of urgency and discomfort that decreases as the bladder fills up again, then Equisetum may relieve symptoms.If a patient has to urinate frequently during the night and passes large amounts of urine, or feels a painful urge but has to strain to make the urine flow, and experiences pain in the back before the urine passes, Lycopodium may be helpful.If the patient has an irritated bladder with a constant need to empty, passing only small amounts; cramping or burning pain in the bladder area; and an itching sensation in the urethra while the urine passes, Nux vomica might be suggested.When the bladder is inflamed; a frequent urge to urinate is felt; there is a burning sensation at the end of urination; urine only dribbles while sitting, but passes more freely when the person is standing up; and flakes or sediment are sometimes seen in the urine, Sarsaparilla is often useful. Sarsaparilla can help when the kidneys are involved or stones are forming, but a medical doctor’s care is also needed.If the patient needs to urinate frequently, with a sense that urine will leak if there is a delay, and there are small amounts of involuntary urine loss, Sepia may be helpful. Other symptoms include pressure above the pubic bone or a bearing-down feeling in the bladder region.If a woman’s bladder becomes inflamed after sexual intercourse, especially if sexual activity is new to her, the homeopath might suggest Staphysagria. There also might be a constant burning sensation, a feeling that a drop of urine is rolling down the urethra, or a sense of pressure in the bladder after urinating, as if it is still not empty"},{"Patient":"hi i am taking thyronorm 25 mg and krimson 35 what are the side effects of this tablets will i be pregnant i am taking krimson 35 from just 3 days and thyronorm from 3 years. my tsh levels are normal doc has asked me to take thyronorm for 5 days a week. but i am unable to conceive due to irregular periods","Doctor":"Stop using Thyronorm (levothyroxine sodium )  and get emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an allergic reaction: hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.

Their focus remains on treating the visible and most troublesome signs and symptoms. The cause is left untreated. When it comes to alternative systems or complementary treatments for PCOS, homeopathy offers the best alternative. This is because homeopathy focuses on treating and curing the root cause of the problem. The homeopathic philosophy of disease is not based on the external causes of diseases. Homeopathy believes that the human body has been perfectly enabled by nature to keep itself disease free. It is only when the immunity or its own internal vitality is deranged that the body becomes incapable of keeping itself disease free. Therefore, homeopathy tries to restore the balance of that vitality. Once the vitality regains its original balance, it is able to nurse itself back to health without any external aid. That is why homeopathic medicines are given in very minute doses. Homeopathic medicines like apis, pulsatilla, sepia, lachesis, and graphites are often used in the treatment of PCOS.Hope I have answered your query.

I have carefully gone through your case, and I think I have understood your concern. I will try to address your medical concerns and would suggest you the best of the available treatment options.If IVF doctor is using down regulation protocol for you, then it involves use of medicines called as GnRH analogues.With these injections, your body stops producing sex hormones from ovaries for some time, this leads to hot flushes.Please do not worry, these symptoms will vanish very soon, as doctor starts to give you medicines and injections for egg formation.I hope my answer helps you.Thanks.Wish you great health."},{"Patient":"hi DR,yesterday i have my embryo transfer after PGD/IVF process.3 months ago it was done too but did nt worked.m 25 year,m stressed ,tell me what i do to make it successful,? 16 month passed of my marriage and i also lost my baby when i was 5 month pregnant after marriage,what i do,i have lot of pressure from family too in this regard","Doctor":"Hi there, welcome to HCM,Taking more stress and anxiety will not increase your chances of getting pregnant, please continue to take the medicines given, like Folic acid, Progesterone, Aspirin which must be given to you by the doctor.At 25 years age and at 2nd IVF cycle you have a very good chance of conceiving.

If after surgical treatment for your undescended testes on both the sides, your semen shows no sperms, it is now unlikely that you can have your own sperms. You can go for donor's sperm; then either intra uterine insemination or in vitro fertilization with embryo transfer. However, you have to understand the legal provisions and aspects of donor's semen. Each country has its different laws. Please find out the legal status before you go for donor's sperms. In India, (provided there is no legal hassle)  the cost depends upon the procedure required to be performed and the number of times it needs to be performed. More details may be on the Direct question. Best Wishes,Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hi. I have pcocs and am overweight.. In process of losing weight.. I m trying to conceive.

Thanks","Doctor":"Hi,Ikaclomin helps in egg formation and has to be taken for 5 days from the second day of your period. In women with PCOS the main concern is eggs not being formed, the ikaclomin corrects that.There is a 10-20% chance of pregnancy with each cycle when on ikaclomin.But you should also keep in mind that follicular monitoring from approximately 9th day of the cycle will help time the fertilization.

Today it was still bright yellow and it was clear (not cloudy). Normally, it is clear color or pale yellow, no cloudyness. I am not having unsual urine frequency, or pain or any discomfort (it feels completly normal, but is just different color). I drink iced coffee and I drink water, I havent had any soda or other juice beverages. I do not take multivitamins, I havent changed my diet (egg whites, sausage patty and american cheese on a wrap for breakfast). small soup (either chicken noodle or beef noodle) for lunch with a side of veggies, and usually a meat, veggie and starch for dinner. Also, please note that I have PCOS but do not have diabeties. Could the urine change be pregnancy, or perhaps something else?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,From your history, I have not understood whether you have missed your period or not. Of course, though the first cardinal symptom of pregnancy is missing the period, since you are a case of PCOS, your menses could be irregular. Hence missed period cannot be relied upon in you . However, the urinary changes that you have explained are not the signs of pregnancy. Still if you have got doubt, please get your urine tested for pregnancy. Cloudy appearance of your urine could be due to crystals in the urine. Please get your urine examined to find the cause. If you are keen on becoming pregnant, you have to get your PCOS treated. In this condition, the eggs get stuck up in the ovaries. The doctors will give you medicines to release eggs; however you also have to cooperate in the management of PCOS by bringing down your weight. I hope this helps you.

And nearl30% of them had pelvic inflammation disease. The rest 30% were caused by other medical conditions, such as uterine fibroids, Pelvic Congestion Syndrom, ovarian cysts, and tumors. Medicines like common antibiotics and hormones can't drive away the kind of pain completely. Because most of antibiotics and hormones couldn't reach to the root of the diseases. Pelvic pain would easily reoccur once patients stop taking the medicines. Through yoga and physiotherapy could reduce the pain temporally, since patients always compensate with other muscles to avoid using the ones that hurt, leading to ankle pain, for example.

However, there is a thought amongst we Gynaecologists that it should not be continued for more than 6 months. The chances of success become less after that. As you have very rightly proposed, IUI seems to be a good option for you. With prolifen you are forming eggs; however, the oligospermia seems to be the apparent factor for non-conception in you. There are good chances that intrauterine insemination after sperm washing (capacitation) would work for you. You may try it for 3 months. If this also does not work for you, then there are other methods of assisted reproduction like intracellular sperm injection (ICSI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), etc. which you may go for after your Gynaecologist's advice.

Sperm morphology as measured by the so called Krugerberg Strict criteria does correlate with pregnancy outcomes, but I would also like to know the sperm count. If the sperm count is very high, a low morphology will not be very detrimental, as you should understand that even among men who have conceived normally, the sperm morphology as measured by the strict criteria will be quite often only 5-8%. We have seen people with 1% morphology conceiving and therefore this is not the end of the world.

I have normal periods, I ovulate every month(confirmed through temping my bbt), and I feel like i ve been trying close to a year. I have always been pretty healthy. No, we have not actually had a pre conception check up so I really don t know how good of a sperm count my fiance has yet. but my question is, I check my cervical position and have noticed in the passed that I have tiny bumps on my cervix. I googled it and it said cervical polyps. I heard it can hurt chances of conceiving, and I m just wondering if there are any home remedies I can do to get rid of them. Like I said, I don t always have them. Just feel them every now and then.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.The bumps you likely are feeling on your cervix are most likely Nabothian cysts rather than polyps.  Polyps are fleshy soft growths that are just outpouching of the normal glands that line the canal of the cervix.  It would be difficult to feel them and they usually cause irregular bleeding or bleeding after sex.  They do not cause infertility (uterine polyps can, but those are not the same and are not possible to feel because they are inside your uterus.Nabothian cysts are just blocked mucus glands that can feel like knobby bumps on the cervix.  They also are not harmful and do not interfere with fertility.Both of these findings on your cervix can be seen on a speculum exam, so a GYN doctor would be able to tell you what you are feeling if they looked inside you.Also, regarding the position of your cervix, this also has no bearing on fertility and does not change from month to month, so you do not need to check your cervix regularly especially if you have a yearly gynecologic checkup.Regarding BBT charting for conception, your temperature goes up AFTER you ovulate, so I recommend not checking it anymore if you know around when you ovulate in your cycle and just have sex every other day from the time your period finishes until you feel premenstrual symptoms.  Some women only have sex after their temperature goes up and they miss the actual time of ovulation. So there is no reason to suspect you will have problems conceiving and you do not need to be treated for this because it is a normal finding in many women.  80 percent of couples will conceive within a year.  If you have been having sex at the right time and it's almost a year, it might be wise to have a GYN exam and a hormonal evaluation, and also have your fiance get his sperm count checked, as 50 percent of the time it can be a male factor.I hope I was able to answer your question and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes and good luck with your pregnancy plans, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, My wife and I are going through IVF due to MFI.

If you have done your pregnancy test 2 weeks after missed period, it is most unlikely to give false negative results. Still, I would suggest you to get ultrasonography done. At this stage, it should provide you direct visual evidence of the fact. During ultrasonography, please request the doctor to have a look at the ovaries and the thickness of the endometrium (uterine lining). This will help to arrive at some diagnosis of the missed period. If you are not pregnant and the ultrasonography does not show any abnormal finding (and even if some abnormal findings are noted), you may get your reproductory hormonal profile done: FSH, LH, Oestrogen, Progesterone and Prolactin. Usually, most of the women having regular marital relations conceive within first year, many of the remaining conceive during the next year. Now it is 3 years that you are trying for pregnancy, in vain. So I feel it is high time you and your husband start investigating yourselves for the infertility problem. The easiest and simple investigation to start with is semen examination of your husband. Report to the Gynaecologist who will advise you the required investigations and follow up. I sincerely hope, you do not require any follow up for infertility."},{"Patient":"hi doctor iam mamata and iam married 3months ago and we are trying for child now periods for last 3months are irregular due to stress and  travelling my LMP was on 10 june and we tried on ovulation day so what are the chances for conceiving","Doctor":"Hi dear, I have gone through your question and understand your concerns.

I am interested in fertility drug without a lot of timely testing. We are both lawyers in a small town and we do not want anyone to know . I am 45 years old. I had two healthy pregnancies (ages 25 and 21). I miscarried in 2012. I have not conceived since that time. My SO has never had children (except for the miscarriage). Is there a fertilty drug that is safe and my help me conceive at my age?","Doctor":"Hallow Lawyer,There are many medicines which help in assisting the conception. However, each medicine is fault specific. Problems in fertility could be due to either fault in man or woman. The fault in man could be low or unhealthy sperms. Depending up on the fault, the treatment changes. If there are any transport problems, the treatment differs. In woman, the faults can be grossly trifurcated into non formation or release of eggs, unfavourable uterine environment and block in the genital tract not allowing the sperms to meet the egg. Each fault needs a specific treatment. There is no blanket treatment for infertility without knowing the cause behind it. You cannot defend your client if you do not know the offence. It is just like that. Please take help of a Gynaecologist to pinpoint the cause of infertility. For the diagnosis, you will have to undergo a battery of investigations. Once the fault is detected, the case can be managed effectively and scientifically.Since you have conceived previously,  the chances are good however, your age is against the good chances.

Your sperm count is not bad to label you incapable of fertilization; however, your semen volume is low. Try to increase the volume by including extra proteins in your diet. The other important parameters of the semen examination are missing. The sperm motility, morphology of the sperms, etc. form vital parameters of the semen examination. If you mention that, I may be I a better position to guide you further. You may please ask me direct question and upload your reports for me. Siotone that you have been prescribed is a medicine which is supposed to help in sexual weakness and improving the libido. I have my own doubts how much it will be useful in improving the quantity and quality of your sperms. I would advise you to get your post coital semen examination performed. For this examination, the semen is collected from the vagina after the intercourse. The motility of the sperms is assessed under microscope. If the motility is grossly affected, it suggests that there are antibodies present in the vagina of your wife which are killing the sperms. In such case, intrauterine insemination may help. I hope this will guide you for further steps."},{"Patient":"hello my name is ana i have a i benn with my husband for 5 yrs almost 6 i benn trying to get pregnant but i cant i had to take birth control pilss to regulate my period i was using them and it was helping me. now i stopped using them like a month or two and i been getting my period normally. now do you think i could get pregnant? im 18 yrs old","Doctor":"hii ana..i understand your concern. you said you were trying to get pregnant since 5yrs, in order to know your clear history, i have a few questions for you like,1) did you use any treatment while you were trying to get pregnant?2) do you have irregular periods because you said you were on birth control pills?Usually after stopping the birth control pills, you should be able to conceive in around 4 to 5 cycles of your period.

Our first child is now 8 years old (same father).  This cycle, I did 100 mg of Clomid on days 5-9 and went for the progesterone test on Day 22.  On Day 23, I got a positive Ovulation Predictor Kit result along with ovarian pain and tenderness.  The bloodwork results (from a draw on Day 22) showed that I did not ovulate.  I am not surprised as I believe I ovulated on Day 24 or so.  I am now on Day 29.  My doctor's office did not mention having my progesterone levels tested again but are sending me to a reproductive endocrinologist on a referral.  I truly believe I ovulated around Day 24.  My average cycle is around 38 days, which would mean a luteal phase of 14 days.  Could I be pregnant or does the negative results on the bloodwork (taken before I believe I ovulated) indicate otherwise?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can clarify this for you.You are absolutely correct in the fact that the length of your cycle is related to when you ovulate... and your ovulation date is 14 days back from when you got your period, rather than counting 14 days from the start of your period.  It is typical for most women to have a 14 day luteal phase, as you suggested.  You absolutely may ovulate later in your cycle.  I do not know how long you and your partner have tried to conceive before trying Clomid.  I would not recommend trying Clomid at all unless you have tried for a year (meaning unprotected sex at least 2-3 times per week) and not become pregnant.  A reproductive endocrinologist is an appropriate referral if you have a history of infertility for one year, and if you fail at least 3 cycles of Clomid.  They can prescribe Clomid and combine it with intrauterine insemination, which can increase the success rate.  Even though you may have had a child together before, there can be an issue with the male partner too, and it would be advisable he get his sperm count evaluated.But you can still have conceived this cycle if you ovulated on the clomid, and continued to have unprotected sex at least a week after your ovultion kit showed positive.  Your progesterone level pre-ovulation is not relevant at all. So- if you don't get a period by day 35 or so, do a pregnancy test.  And if you didn't conceive this cycle, a reproductive endocrinologist might be a better choice to manage your Clomid.I hope this answered your question, and best of luck in getting pregnant.Take care, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"hello, my heart keeps stop beating and it makes me feel like i have been on aroller coaster ride like a real rush or something this is happenin alot prob. 10  to 15 time a day I also have SVT and take meds for this and this has never happened before been on meds for five years what is going on?","Doctor":"Hello,SVT (supraventricular tachycardia) often associated with increased heartbeats.

Hence, immediately on the next day, very rightly IUI was performed. Now daily intercourse for two days after that is advised for additional coverage, in case the egg is released late. After the ovulation life of an egg is 24 hours. So any intercourse after that may not be of use from fertility angle. Continuation of ultrasonography for confirmation of ovulation might have been useful to decide how long daily or alternate days intercourse is to be continued.

Apparently, your semen parameters show that it might be the problem you are not achieving pregnancy. Especially the motility is very low (only 25%). Generally, if the semen motility is under 50%, then the chances of conceiving naturally are extremely reduced as the semen can not pass the natural barriers of the female reproductive tract. Moreover, the presence of pus cells might indicate an active infection of your genital tract. However, the motility of the semen could be affected by some infections. Therefore, try to diagnose the infection and treat it and then examine your sperm motility again. If it is still low, than your chances of achieving a natural conception are very low and maybe you should go for artificial conceiving techniques.Hope it helps!

I split up with my partner after suspecting he had been cheating and started a relationship with a new partner at the end of July. At the end of August I went for an STI check (because of entering a relationship with my new partner) and tested positive for Chlamidiyah my new partner was also tested but was negative although they treated us him as well as myself for precautionary measures.

I am also worried about my fertilitiy after all of this. Could you please shed some light. Many thanks","Doctor":"Hallow, I have gone through your detailed history and have got the gist of it.We have to discuss your problem in two parts.1. Chlamydia can co-infect with gonorrhoea also. These STI can block the tubes. If the block is complete, it will lead to infertility while if it is incomplete, it may cause ectopic pregnancy (which you had). Now I would advice you to undergo thorough investigations for tubal patency by hysterosalpingography (injecting a radio-opaque dye in the uterus and tubes and taking an X-ray). Depending up on the conditions of your tube(s) you may take further decision.2. Now you are having pain in the abdomen, your doctors have started antibiotics for you: both these facts indicate that you may have pelvic infection. Pelvic infection does result in adhesions in the pelvis resulting in to partial or tubal obstruction. To see the adhesions, laparoscopy will be right intervention through which these adhesions may be broken. I must appreciate your attitude and your doctor's decision to treat both of you simultaneously. In fact that is the dictum of treatment of STI, otherwise the recurrence is known. Now please get investigated on the lines I have suggested you for achieving a normal pregnancy.

No myomertrial lesions are observed. A central central echogenic endometrium with normal thickness is observed; it measures 8.2mm. There is no fluid in the endometrial cavity. the ovaries are of normal morphology and show an increase in echotexture due to multiple small peripheral cysts. the right ovary measures 38.8x37.5x4.8mm (volume 18.9 ml) and the left ovary measures 38.5x38.1x24.8mm (volume 19.1ml) there is no fluid in the cul-de sac. My question is what exactly is this saying? will i be able to have kids since I am trying to? Please help","Doctor":"hello dearI understand your problem , dear  you can plan for pregnancy as according to your ultrasound picture you have polycystic ovaries while no uterine pathology and endometrial thickness is normal so before planning the concern are first if your menstrual are not regular you can start oral contraceptive pills for 3 to 4 cycles to regularise cycles, secondly if you are obese or have insulin resistance you should reduce weight by exercise , diet control and you can also try metformin then also if you are not able to conceive consult doctor get thorough examination done and can go for ovulation induction.

The fact that your husbands' moving sperm is less than 50% then your doctor is right to suggest you go for an IUI, meaning artificially placing the washed sperm of your husband into your uterus in order to increase the chance of pregnancy. Since you already had an abortion it means that you are able to conceive and maybe the low quality of husband's sperm is the problem. Therefore, IUI seems the best option for you.As regards the rhesus issue, yes, you should be vaccinated against anti-rhesus antibodies but this is done once you are pregnant, usually at week 28 and 34 of pregnancy, in order to protect your second baby. Therefore, you need this only if you plan to have a second child since non-vaccination is not harmful for the first baby. However, if you are pregnant then the medical staff will definitely remind and suggest you to get vaccinated regardless of your attention to have a second child or not.Best !"},{"Patient":"Hello Dr, Me and My wife are trying to have a baby from 1 year, but there is no luck till now. i have gone through semen analysis couple of times and im taking a medicine called (SPEMAN & PHARMATON), im eating vegetables, fruits, but no regular excercise.

Most recently the conclusion seems to be that her egg quality is being affected by an early spike in progesterone before her eggs are fully mature on a lupron protocol (10 iu daily) that should be suppressing the progesterone. The level jumped from 1.7 to 3.5 between days 7 and 8 of her last egg retrieval cycle.. My questions are: 1) what type of testing could be done to try to determine the root cause of this early progesterone spike? 2) is there any other way to regulate this type of thing through diet or medication? 3) any other recommendations on how to approach this problem?

In fact you should have asked this question as a premier question where you could have uploaded all your reports for our review before advice.

Currently, since you have mentioned that there is nothing abnormal in both of you and you fulfil the required criteria for fertilization, I would advise you to follow the following ordeal: 1. Please subject your wife routinely for ovulation monitoring to locate the day of egg formation (ovulation).2. Usually the ovulation takes place after the follicle has attained the size of 18+ mm.3. Base on the size of the ovulation, plan your intercourse around this day. Try to have it at least on alternate days. Give such a trial for 3-6 cycles. 4. If this does not work, you may require hCG support. Please consult your Gynaecologist for that.5. If still this does not work, you may go for intrauterine semen instillation (with advice of your Gynaecologist only).6. Otherwise you may have to think of Artificial Reproductory Technique.I know I have give you a broad general outline of the plan. If you share with me your all the reports and then answer my some questions based on the reports and your history, I can specify the advice to a narrow options.

I was not ovulating but I am now, with the help of meds. I have had EVERY test in the book and besides the anovulation, everything else is good. My husband had a Semen Analysis done and the RE we are seeing said I would need an IUI to achieve pregnancy while an independent Urologist said the results look just fine. I would love to have a 3rd opinion.

Similarly spouse's spermatogenesis and erectile actions and mutual rapport to reach orgasm without stress also plays a pivotal role in conceiving.

I can understand that you have had a stressed day and that may contribute to higher blood pressure. If you don't have any other disease (renal disease), you can take another Losartan.

It's a complex issue of discretion of various specialists and should not be commented upon by all and sundry.Here is where holistic approach gains importance.  In Ayurveda medicines which help to manage thyroid problems, also manage endometrial cleansing to help conception and maintaining Hb levels too e.g. Arogyavardhini Vati. ( this is only an example). Ayurveda doctors also plan various combos such as Kanchnar guggul and Arogyavardhini vati etc decided on the basis of given circumstances.To abridge, my opinion is that Ayurveda specialistay be consulted to find a middle way. Current regime and Ayurveda do not counteract or interact if given concurrently at required gaps.In our career we have seen such complex cases finally conceiving with the help of Ayurveda.

No invasive methods, no synthetic drugs, no side effects....only herbo mineral Ayurveda.Yes, if you want your current regime to continue, you may do so but by giving some gap between two kinds of medicines.

I don t want my Bp to go any lower.","Doctor":"Hello,Brief Answer: Your blood pressure readings are good, no need to take the spironolactone evening dose. The heart rate of 85 is accepted.Explanation: My opinion is that the normal heart rate is from 60 to 100,  increasing or decreasing according to physiological conditions such as stress or sleeping. Some times we need heart rate to be resting at 60 in some patients such as an ischemic patient. If you are not ischemic, your heart rate of 85 is accepted. All diuretics should be taken during the day and it is not recommended to take it during the night as it would bother you going to the bathroom all night long.I suggest my patients the following: Maintain good hydration, salt restriction and follow up lower limb edema. The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition I would ask them about the diagnosis and other comorbidities.Conclusion: I suggest you as for heart rate,  nothing to worry about, do take a night dose of spironolactone and check with your physician.Hope I have answered your query.

But there are limits to it also. When best of advancements are not able to help a patient, he/ she should not hesitate to get help of herbal options without interrupting their current treatment. These herbal Ayurveda med are safe and totally harmless and doesn't counteract with allopathy. Can be taken by giving reasonable gap of say 30 to 60 minutes of allopathy medicine.The principle involved is Aartav Shudhhi i.e. cleansing reproductive systems in females by inducing normal m.c. and ovulation by activating the organs with the help of pure herbal decoctions etc. Males may need different approach if reqd.After these functions attain normalcy, endometrium and other uterine consistencies are taken care of. We have seen many successful results in failed fertility cases. Yes any surgically correctable deformity may not be helped much. Had I been your family doctor, would have instructed to see Ayurveda doctor without delay. The only hitch with people is that it doesn't look very fancy to seek Ayurveda. Though these are time tested over 70 centuries. Modern advancements have their own value but in case of need both systems are complimentary and supplementary to each other for the benefit of mankind.Hope it helps you."},{"Patient":"I had a heart cath on 10-12 the doc nicked my fem.artery I was took from stone crest to centennial by ambulance given over 5 pints of blood in ICUs sent home thu.Now my r leg is swollen purp,my testicles are black and can barely walk.I am a subox patient can t take pain killers ,but I am in agony.I am so scared","Doctor":"Hello,If I were you, I would go to the hospital and visit a doctor to rule out any possible hematoma in the region of the femoral artery.

I asked for a copy of the report and the report says that my ejection fraction is 91 %. I did some reading and learned the 50 to 70 % is normal. So I guess my 91% IS HIGH. Does that mean that my test results are not good and that I need to see a specialist?","Doctor":"Hello, Brief Answer: During stress or exercise, your heart ejection fraction increases.Explanation: My opinion is that during vigorous exercise or excessive stress, the heart responds by increasing both heart rate and function. That is meant by ejection fraction. In normal conditions, ejection fraction ranges from 50 to 70 %. Ninety percent ejection fraction may be a little bit overestimated but as long as there’s the test is negative, nothing to worry about. The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition I would ask them about hydration status during the stress test.Conclusion: I suggest you check with your physician.Hope I have answered your query.

I get blotted, noxious after drinking only one glass of white wine. Although I do not drink much, I ve had a couple episodes of atrial fibrillation in the past 2 to 3 years. These episodes were serious enough for me to be kept in the ICU of the hospitals I went to. Both lasted for 48 hours+ followed by a couple of days of watch time. Ever since the second episodes, I was prescribed to take Rytmonorm 150 coupled with Coraspin 300 to avoid any blood clots. After 2 years on the treatment, I ve hoped that my heart would be clear of the problem and tried to get off of the medicine. Within 24 hours, my heart started to beat erratically, enough so that I immediately reached for the pills... Along with my heart beating awkwardly, I ve noticed an almost instant pain in my head coupled with a slight but persistent confusion... I have repeatedly told about the combination of effects to a few doctors only to be dismissed at once as there doesn t seem to be any correlation with the heart/brain (as per the doc s opinions)... I have gotten a check-up with my cardiologist a couple of weeks ago and he recommends that I stay on the medication (one of my valve (top?) is 4cm wide whereas it should be at maximum 3.8cm (from memory, and I can t remember what was what exactly). Also, there was another measure from the ECG of 450ms or such between beat... Where it should stay under 450 or 430... Again, I do not recall the exact lingo... My question is simple. Are there any known adverse effect to taking a medication such as Rytmonorm, does it affect the initial problem (atrial fibrillation)? Is there any way to remedy the problem without resorting to ablation (which has a low success rate) or cut through the electrical system (old style)... I really would like to get off the medication. Thank you for your time and feedback on this case. Best Regards, Frederic","Doctor":"Hello,Ritmonorm is for rhythm control that means if you have had episodes of atrial fibrillation that have been resolve in sinus rhythm you must take these medicines, to stay in sinus rhythm and to prevent episodes of atrial fibrillation.

Low sperm count is even before your husband had this viral infection.What is the count? What about complete semen analysis?Has he undergone any investigations?

Please get him examined from a urologist to find out whether he is having varicose veins in the scrotum. That also brings down the sperms. Moreover, you are also having irregular menses. Your work up is very important. Please find out first whether you release eggs regularly or not. For that your hormonal estimations in the blood is required. Also study of the lining of uterus reveals so many things. Have you got it done?

Though count per ml looks normal, due to low amount, the total sperm count is also low; moreover the abnormal morphology count is considerably high. Presence of WBCs - white blood cells, pus cells and epithelial cells in the semen suggest presence of some infection. However, many times, immature sperms are misread as pus cells in the semen.This infection could be the cause of seminal low quality and quantity. You may have to take antibiotics for this infection.

Our 4 IUI's by this doctor were unsuccesful. Now we are taking another doctors treatment from Lilavati Hospital. Our 5th IUI was also unsuccesfull. So we underwent the ICSI procedure in the month of may. After being pregnant for 2 and 1/2 months we learnt form the sonography that the baby had no heart beat and it seemed to be abnormal. So i had the abortion done as per doctors consultation. The remains of the fetus were sent for testing and it was learnt that the X chromosome was missing in each of the 23 pairs. Now we are awaiting for 2 iCSI procedure to be done . What are my chances of successful pregnancy. Further more this with the continous injections and medicine this procedure becomes more tiring and stressful.","Doctor":"Hi I have gone through your question and understand your concerns. An AMH level of2.69 indicates that your ovaries are having very low activity. In such conditions, IVF or ICSI has to be done for conception. Low sperm count and low motility in your husband also is a reason for ICSI or IVF  required for conception.ICSI has  success rate of 30-40% in each cycle,depending upon the quality of ovum and sperm.Absence of X chromosome in your fetus means it was having Turners Syndrome, which is a chromosomal anomaly and has low recurrence rate in subsequent pregnancies.I would suggest you to be hopeful and not to take stress, as that also has effect on the result of ICSI.Hope you found the answer helpful.

I had surgery for endometriosis about a year ago and have been on clomid for past 7-8 months. I ve been through 2 cycles of IUI with no luck. I know clomid is the first choice of drugs for infertility. If that does not work what do you suggest I should try next?","Doctor":"Hi, I have gone through your question and understand your concerns. Clomid is clomiphene citrate which is a ovulation induction drug, and it is the drug of choice in infertility caused by disturbances in ovulation. Clomid should be taken for maximum 6 cycles continously at a time, as it leads to rapid depletion of follicles and poor response rate after 6 cycles.Intrauterine insemination can be tried for 3-6 cycles in a row, depending upon your age and other medical factors.Endometriosis leads to distorted fallopian tubes which lead to infertility. It has a high recurrence rate, and thus can be a cause of infertility in your case.I would suggest you and your partner to consult an infertility specialist and get properly examined, investigated and treated accordingly.

There is hormonal imbalance in this. Infertility, irregular menses and coarse hairs on the unwanted sites are few symptoms of the whole underlying syndrome. The main aim is to get the eggs released. There are different types of medicines which are given to get these eggs released. I am specifically not prescribing them here as they are to be prescribed by a specialist only after thorough investigations. Moreover, these medicines have to be taken under an expert supervision. There is another mode of managing these cases by surgical intervention. Now-a-days, puncture of the ovaries is done through laparoscope (telescope). Some prefer to do it as a primary line of treatment while others only after the failure of conservative line of treatment.However, while your treatment is on, please get your partners evaluation also done.

In that case you will have to undergo an antibiotics treatment.Anyway, both of you are undergoing infertility treatment. So all physical and laboratory investigations must be on the card.

WSinEce thiNs query is directed to our panel of specialists and super-specialists, please mention your problem in as much detail as possible. Do not forget to highlight your Age, Gender, Medical History and Treatment History of the problem you are facing.I'M 34Years old, Female, i got married last year and since then i have been trying to conceive, i have gone for series of test, like HSG, HORMONAL TEST, SO MY DOCTOR RECOMMEND BROMOCRIPTINE TO BE TAKEN THREE TIMES DAILY. CAN THESE DRUG MAKE ME PREGNANT","Doctor":"You should have furnished with the results of the test. Bromocryptine is usually prescribed for the women who are facing infertility due to non formation of eggs with milk production.This milk production is because of increased levels of a hormone called as prolactin coming from pituitary gland. This hormone in turn suppresses the production of other hormones which are required for egg formation and release. So if your hormone tests indicate that prolactin levels are high, Bromocryptine is indicated and it does help in egg formation. This drug does cause a lot of nausea and vomiting, however, you will have to show good adherence to the drug.Please follow your doctors advice."},{"Patient":"iam a 27 year old lady, taking the treatment for infertility since two years. two years before with medication i was conceived but happened a missed abortion. i had a teeth pain and  taken some tablet also for that just before tha missed abortion.

Humog HP 75 is human menopausal gonadotropin which is given for ovulation induction. It will increase the chances of conception, especially in anovulatory infertility caused by PCOS and hypothyroidism.The line of management in infertilty in PCOS is ovulation induction, intrauterine insemination and in vitro fertilization in that order.Hypothyroidism has to be controlled by levothyroxin because abnormal TSH levels also lead to ovulation disorder.Hope you found the answer helpful.Wishing you good health."},{"Patient":"I am 40 yr old, my semen test shows: Physical exam- milky white,translucent,self liquifaction occurred in 20 min,normal viscosity, vol-0.5 ml.

During the last couple of months of normal fetal development, the testicles gradually descend from the abdomen through a tube-like passageway in the groin (inguinal canal) into the scrotum. In order for testicles to develop and function normally, they need to be slightly cooler than normal body temperature. The scrotum provides this cooler environment.If the testicles do not descend they remain in the abdomen or in groin.In order to prevent the complications of undescended testes like infertility and testicular cancer later, a surgical operation (orchiopexy) is done to correct their position and fix them in the scrotal sac.This is usually done between 3 months to 12 months of the age to reduce the risk of complications.Low sperm counts, poor sperm quality and decreased fertility are more likely to occur among men who've had an undescended testicle. Since the surgical operation was delayed in your case, that could be reason behind azoospermia.You are advised to consult your doctor for the follow up.Best regards!"},{"Patient":"hi dr, im 31 yr old married women and im under treatment for infertility for past 10 yrs. my husband is having severe azoospermia.

As i am in a colder country am a bit over weight (though my doctor said its fine) and am not able to reduce my weight inspite of being on proper diet and cycling, will this medicine have any effect in ganning weight? Normally when am in India I easily reduce weight and also am able to maintain it as I sweat a lot. please do advise me as I really dont want to miss out on any option cause of which i can get pregnant as its more than 2 years of trying and its sometimes depressing inspite of evrything being ok with me and my husband. Please help :)","Doctor":"Hi, I have one through your problem. When all the tests of the couple are normal and still they are unable to conceive naturally, then the condition is known as unexplained infertility. It is responsible for approximately 30-40% cases of infertility. In such cases, the stepwise treatment protocol is followed, the next step is taken when the previous one fails:1. ovulation induction drugs (clomiphene, letrozol)2. Intrauterine insemination (IUI)3. In- vitro fertilization (IVF)Letroz is an ovulation induction drug, while naturagest and lupigest are progesterones to make uterine environment more conducive for pregnancy.These are hormones which do cause increase in weight and very minor side effects. I would suggest you to go for IUI if you have failed to conceive after 5-6 cycles of the above drugs.Hope you found this answer helpful. Wishing you good health."},{"Patient":"So when i was 3 i was diagnosed with growth hormone defciency and i took daily shots in my stomach until i was 14 and my doctor said if i didn't get my period by 16 i have to go back and see whats wrong. i am 16 and still no period. so i was wondering what could be wrong? what tests they will run? if it will be awkward? if its normal? ya know just so i'm not freaked out about this! ps.. i really don't like going to my doctor. it's a guy and i just think its awkward talking about period stuff.","Doctor":"thank you for posting your query in healthcaremagic.com.....see first of all, talking to a doctor about anything is not awkward....but for proper diagnosis and treatment, you should tell your doctor everything...anyways, primary amenorrhea is said to be present when there is no periods and no secondary sexual character at age 13 or no periods but presence of secondary sexual character at age 15...so irrespective of your secondary characters like breast growth, pubic hair etc you are suffering from primary amenorrhea....well there are various reasons behind primary amenorrhea, most common being genetic and uterine developmental defects...so in my opinion, you should definitely visit your GYNAECOLOGIST and he/she would run some tests like usg, laparoscopy or hysteroscopy and might be karyotyping also depending on your features...also definitely some hormonal studies also....it might not be very serious till now, so dont worry but visit your doctor immediately...hope this was helpful....come back to me for further queries...regards"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have done a Hb electrophoresis test (for fertility treatment) and the result come back that my ALT is high 90 and the dr asked me for another test after 1 month.

Heartburn and night sweats may need some attention.Explanation: My opinion is that ischemic heart disease is a bit of concern. Risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and lifestyle are leading causes. Chest pain you describe may need more investigations. Sweating that is related to chest pain or effort is also a symptom of ischemic heart disease. Shoulder pain you describe is mostly not related to other symptoms. I suggest my patients the following: Full medical history clinical examination and some laboratory investigations and electrocardiography. The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition, I would ask them about other risk factors.Conclusion: I suggest you check with your physician.

That is the common cause of hormonal imbalance resulting in irregular ovulation. Have you done any investigations before. Since you are not menstruating regularly it suggests that you are not ovulating regularly. As you conceived once in all probably your husbands semen analysis is normal. You and your husband should consult subfertiliy specialist . You need to do hormone test including thyroid function tests  and Fallopian tube patency test.  Your husband should do semen analysis. Based on the results of investigations treatment can be given.  For irregular ovulation you need to take medications like clomiphene to induce ovulation. I hope I have answered to your satisfaction.

MAINTAING a normal BMI definitely improves your chances of pregnancy. So take this issue seriously. Are your periods regular?  Since your doctor has said everything is normal I presume your hormone tests and Fallopian tube patency test and your husbands semen analysis are normal. Some amount of semen flowing back after sex is normal. Don't worry about itYou are still young. So first Work on reducing weight for 6 months.  If you don't conceive in a years time consult your doctor. Then you may need tablets or hormones to achieve pregnancy. Take one tablet of folic acid daily from now on.

When PCOD is diagnosed usually siphene is given to promote ovulation. This helps in ovulation and hence conception.Susten is given to maintain initial pregnancy if you conceive with siphene.If this fails for 2 to 3 cycles then IUI may be started . It is Intrauterine ingestion of sperms. This further increases chances of pregnancy .

While doing IVF we give strong drugs to stimulate ovary. This may cause over stimulation and side effects like pleural effusion, ascitis , breathlessness , weight gain etc. These all are due to estrogen excess leading to water accumulation. In IVF we transfer 4 to 5 embryo so that 1 or 2 survive . Sometimes all may survive and cause multiple pregnancy. These are main side effects . Others are like infection , mood changes due to hormone supplement and weekness , failure of IVF etc. Infection occurs due to putting of outside grown embryo.Hope I Have answered your query.

To increase your chances of conception maintain normal BMI, quit smoking ( if you're a smoker) and have intercourse at least three times in a week.Since  you had an ectopic earlier there is a small possibility that the fallopian  tubes may not be doing their job as they should be. If I were your doctor, I would wait for 4-5 months. If you don't conceive by then I would suggest a diagnostic laparoscopy.

Were the two ultrasounds done by the same doctor?The fact that it was not seen on day 13 means that you have ovulated ( the follicle must have ruptured). In all probability this is the reason. So don't worry. A small possibility is that the first ultrasound itself was wrong and that there was no dominant follicle in the first ultrasound.

You have  not mentioned  how low is your husbands sperm count. Is there any evidence of infection in the semen analysis done. What about other parameters of sperm   like morphology , motility etc. Your husband needs to see a andrologist who can assess him better.  If you have already done six cycles of insemination and have not conceived the next mode of treatment will be IVF.

I had got pregnant in 1st year of my marriage, but got miscarriage, due to unknown reasons (as per my doc). In these 2yrs., I have gone through Folliculometry - 3 times, then an IUI. But, all these tests didn t gave me result. Then my Gynaec informed me that as my cervix is tight, hence she dilated it. Also, I have already got my fallopian tubes checked, and it is clear. Last December, I got Laproscopy done, to check if there are any other issue. But, overall the result - NO ISSUE. My Gynaec is calling it - An Unexplained Infertility. Now, the problem is, that after the laproscopy, I have started getting irregular periods. I am having a 28days cycle, but in 1 month it came 12days before, and now since 3 months its 30 days cycle. I really don t know now what to do. Even bcoz of the menstrual cycle disturbance, I am unable to calculate my Ovulation Cycle. I am also now afraid and tired for taking so much medications. Some of my friends around me, have even told me that I should not have gone through so many test. And are advising me to take break from all this medications. Pls help. Need your guidance.","Doctor":"HiIt appears that your doctor has done all necessary investigations and now concluded that infertility is unexplained.How young are you?  You have done the right thing by undergoing these investigations. Don't get concerned with your friends comments.I want to make it clear to you that laparoscopy you had is not going to affect your menstrual cycle.Having  28 or 30 days cycle is normal. It does not amount to irregular cycles.Once in a year or so if you had one irregular cycle, that is also fine. Now coming to treatment of your unexplained infertility. If I were your doctor first I would recommend six cycles of gonadotropin stimulated IUI. If you don't conceive with this I would advise IVF treatment. Take one tab of folic acid daily. Maintain normal BMI.If you both are smokers you need to quit smoking.To increase your chances of conception you need to have regular intercourse 2-3 times in a week and not just during ovulation period.

We have recently just started our first cycle of superovulation and I just had a question to ask.  During superovulation can your body naturally ovulate without having the hgc injection.  It's just i was due to take the injection and i felt some pains as though i was starting to ovulate.  I have now taken the injection and i am still feeling the pains.  Does this mean i might be ovulating now (at my normal time) and not 36 hours or so after the injection was taken.  It's just that i want to get the timing right and as it is a bank holiday weekend i am not able to ask my clinic for a couple of days.  If this is the case and i am ovulating now, how long do i have in order to fertilise the egg.  Thank you","Doctor":"HiIn many cases of ovulation induction we don't even prescribe Hcg injection as most women ovulate even without it. The reason the injection is prescribed is to make sure that you ovulate. So it is very much possible that you ovulated before the injection. It is generally said after ovulation the egg remains fertile for 24 hrs. Let me know if you have any other queries.

It is a test to diagnose tuberculosis. Sometimes genital / womb tb can cause infertility and to diagnose it we gynaecologists take a biopsy from your womb and do the PCR test. It is considered gold standard for diagnosing TB. Secondly , LUF . Lutenised up ruptured follicle syndrome. Normally , every month a follicle starts it journey in the ovary ...it slowly increases in size ,and then when it reaches 18-20 mm it ruptures to release the egg. When this egg and sperm meet pregnancy occurs. In some cases the follicle does not rupture and it is called LUF. In these Cases an injection of HCG can help. Because your follicle has reached 25mm and hasn't ruptured yet ,it is likely that you are suffering from LUF.

I understand your wife took medications  to induce ovulation twice.  Was there ovulation as evidenced by ultrasound or serum progesterone test.If all your tests are normal and there was ovulation with medication continue the treatment for at least six cycles. Don't be anxious. You are a young couple and have a very good chance to conceive. I would also wish to advise regarding the following facts which are important.Your wife should take folic acid 5 mg dailyIf you are smoker you should cut down on it.If your wife is obese she should reduce weight to improve chances of conception.You should have regular intercourse 2-3 times /weekGood luck.

Once you complete duphastone treatment you will get periods within a weeks time and you can start taking medications for induction of ovulation.It is good to know that your BMI is normal. This increases your chances of conceiving.What is your age?  I presume that necessary preliminary tests like semen analysis , hormone test and tubal patency are done.

Now I am very desperate and frustrated. Please help.","Doctor":"HiNoted your history. I can give you advise on allopathy medicines. Levotal is a antibiotic. I did not understand why you took this or may be you wrote the name  of the medication wrong.If your BMI is more than 25kg/M2 you must reduce weight. This is extremely important to improve your chances of ovulation and pregnancy.You need to confirm that your right tube is functioning normally. So you need to get a tubal patancy test done. Since you have irregular cycles it is clear that you are not ovulating regularly. You need help of induction of ovulation medications.When you are taking these medications ovulation should be confirmed with folliculometry studies( ultrasound examination to monitor the growth of follicles in the ovary). Discuss with your doctor regarding this treatment. It is good to do a semen analysis for your husband if not done yet as the last pregnancy was two years ago.Take  folic acid 5mg dailyIf your husband smokes cigarettes he should cut down on smoking.

Concerning activity, it is encouraged as a general rule to do exercise with moderate strength. As for sex life, as important it is, the ischemic patient is advised not to do any vigorous activity that may cause angina. I suggest my patients the following; discuss with your partner the best ways and positions that should satisfy your needs without risking your condition. Also, avoid taking sildenafil or drugs of the same category while on nitrates. Some local creams may be of benefit in some cases. The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition I would ask them about their drug history.Conclusion: I suggest you check with your physician and discuss some ideas with your partner.Hope I have answered your query.

I aim to keep healthy and eat well however lately have been noticing that I am frequently mildly short of breath, even when at rest. It can be at various points during the day and for no real apparent reason and frequently causes me to yawn, feel tired or have limited concentration. Sometimes I feel so tired and almost wheezy that my voice sounds different... almost as if its not getting all the air it usually does behind it. When I was around 14 my parents often told me they thought I may have asthma, however this was never diagnosed and I mostly just ignored it as it wasn t too noticeable to me. 8 Years ago I went for a routine check up and the Doctor mentioned that I had a heart murmur. Again it was never fully looked at as never really noticed it (except for the odd flutter now and again which I considered normal). Now recently i ve been noticing that I m short of breath more frequently, daily even. So I went to the hospital for an unrelated matter last week and whilst was there thought id mention all the above. The shortness of breath has seemed to have affected my confidence lately. They gave me a pre-operative ECG and noticed that it had an incidental RBBB on the charts. Therefore, my question is whether there a chance that these symptoms could all be connected and what might that reason by? Could the murmur, RBBB and mild shortness of breath all be completely separate or possibly something more serious? I know you cant diagnose as such, however i m just looking for thoughts whilst I await an appointment with the Doctor. For info, whilst in hospital my resting pulse rate was 69 (although i ve noticed that can be about 75 at rest on other occasions), and my BP was 129 over 89 at rest which I think is normal. Many thanks","Doctor":"Hello,Right, Bundle Branch Block (RBBB) is a common finding in many young patients. The Heart murmurs may be normal in a young patient too. Shortness of breath and change in voice may be from the heart or lungs. I recommend you thorax radiography and echocardiography.Hope I have answered your query.
