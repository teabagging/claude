Assumption: We assume that the magnitudes of the vectors overrightarrow{a}, overrightarrow{b}, and their sum overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b} are all equal to 1. That is, we have |overrightarrow{a}|=|overrightarrow{b}|=|overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}|=1.2.

Solving for the Dot Product: From the equation above, we can solve for the dot product overrightarrow{a}cdotoverrightarrow{b}:   [   2overrightarrow{a}cdotoverrightarrow{b} = 1 - 2 implies overrightarrow{a}cdotoverrightarrow{b} = -frac{1}{2}   ]4.

Determining the Angle: Given that the cosine of the angle is -frac{1}{2} and considering the range of vector angles is [0,pi], the only angle that satisfies this condition is frac{2pi}{3}.Therefore, the angle between vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} is boxed{frac{2pi}{3}}."},{"problem":"A group of teachers and students totaling 328 people are going on a trip by bus.

What are the limits within which the perimeter of the triangle can fall?","solution":"I. solution. Let k be the perimeter of the triangle. Then[begin{aligned}& k^{2}=(a+b+c)^{2}=left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}right)+2(a b+b c+a c)= & =frac{1}{2}(a-b)^{2}+frac{1}{2}(b-c)^{2}+frac{1}{2}(c-a)^{2}+3(a b+a c+b c)end{aligned}]Considering the condition a b+a c+b c=12, we get[2 k^{2}-72=(a-b)^{2}+(b-c)^{2}+(c-a)^{2}]The right-hand side is non-negative, so k^{2} geqq 36, k geqq 6, and equality holds only if a=b=c. On the other hand, if a=b=c=2, then k=6 and a b+b c+c a=12, so the minimum perimeter is 6.To determine the maximum, we will also use (1). The triangle inequality can be written in the following form:[|a-b| leqq c, quad|b-c| leqq a quad text { and } quad|a-c| leqq b]Thus, the right-hand side of (1) is not greater than c^{2}+a^{2}+b^{2}=k^{2}-2(a b+b c+c a)=k^{2}-24, so[2 k^{2}-72 leqq k^{2}-24, quad k^{2} leqq 48, quad k leqq sqrt{48}=4 sqrt{3}]This gives us an upper bound for the perimeter. The question is: does k take this value? Clearly, it does exactly when equality holds everywhere in (2), which requires allowing degenerate triangles. If we allow this and assume a geqq b geqq c, then we get that k takes the maximum value of 4 sqrt{3} exactly when a-b=c, b-c=a, and a-c=b. Adding the first two equations gives c=0, and from this (in all three equations) a=b follows. Finally, the condition a b+a c+b c=12 with c=0 and a=b gives a=b=2 sqrt{3}.Thus, we have found that the perimeter is at most 4 sqrt{3}, and it is exactly 4 sqrt{3} in the degenerate isosceles triangle where the base is 0 and the two legs are 2 sqrt{3}. The perimeter value therefore varies between 6 and 4 sqrt{3}.II. solution. According to the relationship between the arithmetic and quadratic means,[left(frac{k}{3}right)^{2}=left(frac{a+b+c}{3}right)^{2} leqq frac{a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}}{3}]so[k^{2} leqq 3left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}right)=3left(k^{2}-2(a b+b c+c a)right)=3 k^{2}-72]and from this k^{2} geqq 36, k geqq 6. Here, equality holds if and only if a=b=c=2, so the minimum perimeter is 6.To find the maximum, assume a geqq b geqq c. Then, by the triangle inequality, a leqq b+c, and multiplying by the non-negative a gives[a^{2} leqq a b+a c leqq a b+a c+b c=12]Furthermore, since b geqq c geqq 0, c^{2} leqq b c, and since a geqq b geqq 0, b^{2} leqq a b, so[b^{2}+c^{2} leqq a b+b c leqq a b+a c+b c=12]Adding the two inequalities,[a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2} leqq 24]or k^{2}-2(a b+a c+b c) leqq 24, k^{2}-24 leqq 24, k^{2} leqq 48. If we check under what conditions equality holds in the added two inequalities, we can easily see that it is only when c=0, b=a.Remark. It can be shown that the perimeter takes any value between 6 and 4 sqrt{3}, and except for 4 sqrt{3}, every value is taken in a non-degenerate triangle."},{"problem":"Given x is a positive integer, solve the inequality: 12x + 5 < 10x + 15.","solution":"Solution: Solve the inequality: 12x + 5 < 10x + 15Rearrange the terms: 12x - 10x < 15 - 5This simplifies to: 2x < 10Therefore, x < 5Thus, the values of x are 1, 2, 3, or 4.

By differentiating the function and setting the derivative equal to 0, we find the values of x for which f′(1)=0. Given that the maximum value of the function on the interval (0,e] is 1, we discuss the value of a, determine the extremum, compare the extremum with the values at the endpoints to find the maximum value, and finally establish an equation involving a to solve for the result.SolutionSince f′(x)= dfrac{(2ax−1)(x−1)}{x},Let f′(x)=0, x_{1}=1, x_{2}= dfrac{1}{2a},Because f(x) attains an extremum at x=1,So x_{2}= dfrac{1}{2a}neq x_{1}=1,① When dfrac{1}{2a}  0, x_{2}= dfrac{1}{2a} > 0,(i) When dfrac{1}{2a} < 1, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, dfrac{1}{2a}), monotonically decreasing on ( dfrac{1}{2a},1), and monotonically increasing on (1,e)Thus, the maximum value 1 could be attained at x= dfrac{1}{2a} or x=e,But f( dfrac{1}{2a})=ln dfrac{1}{2a}+a( dfrac{1}{2a})^{2}−(2a+1)⋅ dfrac{1}{2a}=ln dfrac{1}{2a}− dfrac{1}{4a}−1 < 0,So f(e)=ln e+ae^{2}−(2a+1)e=1,Solving gives a= dfrac{1}{e−2},(ii) When 1leqslant dfrac{1}{2a} < e, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0,1), monotonically decreasing on (1, dfrac{1}{2a}), and monotonically increasing on ( dfrac{1}{2a},e),Thus, the maximum value 1 could be attained at x=1 or x=e,But f(1)=ln 1+a−(2a+1) < 0,So f(e)=ln e+ae^{2}−(2a+1)e=1,Solving gives a= dfrac{1}{e−2}, which contradicts 1 < x_{2}= dfrac{1}{2a} < e,(iii) When x_{2}= dfrac{1}{2a}geqslant e, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0,1) and monotonically decreasing on (1,e),Thus, the maximum value 1 could be attained at x=1, but f(1)=ln 1+a−(2a+1) < 0, which is a contradiction,In summary, a= dfrac{1}{e−2} or a=-2.Therefore, the answer is boxed{dfrac{1}{e−2} text{ or } -2}."},{"problem":"2.

There are many safer methods (see [4] P60), one of which is a method of constructing equations: from the given condition, we transform to get(b-c)^{2}-4(a-b)(c-a)=0 text {. }This transformation suggests a discriminant of 0; from the discriminant, we construct the equation(a-b) x^{2}+(b-c) x+(c-a)=0,which has equal roots x_{1}=x_{2}.Since the sum of the coefficients of equation (10) is 0, we getx_{1}=x_{2}=1 text {. }Substituting into the relationship between roots and coefficients, we get1=x_{1} x_{2}=frac{c-a}{a-b} text {, }which means a-b=c-a.Therefore, frac{b+c}{a}=2.This idea is creative, but a good idea was wasted due to a closed mindset.(1) Equation (10) is a quadratic equation, which requires a-b neq 0 to ensure, and it is necessary to supplement the discussion when a=b to make the proposition complete.(2) The entire process uses the discriminant of a quadratic equation, the method of finding roots by observation, and the relationship between roots and coefficients, making the process somewhat convoluted.The reason is that subconsciously, it is assumed that the discriminant (2) corresponds to a unique equation (1). Eliminating this mental obstacle, a more sensible equation can be constructed. The idea is: from equation (9), think of the discriminant of a quadratic equation being 0, and from the equation, think of equal roots, thus constructing an equation with roots x_{1}=a-b, x_{2}=c-a.Solution: The given condition indicates that the quadratic equation with roots a-b, c-abegin{array}{l}{[x-(a-b)][x-(c-a)]=0} Leftrightarrow x^{2}+(b-c) x+(a-b)(c-a)=0end{array}has a discriminant of 0, i.e.,begin{array}{l}Delta=(b-c)^{2}-4(a-b)(c-a) =4left[frac{1}{4}(b-c)^{2}-(a-b)(c-a)right]=0 .end{array}Thus, the two roots of the equation are equal, i.e.,a-b=c-a text {. }Therefore, frac{b+c}{a}=2.Note: If we let alpha=a-b, beta=c-a, thenb-c=-(alpha+beta) text {. }The problem can be transformed into[-(alpha+beta)]^{2}-4 alpha beta=0 Rightarrow alpha=beta text {. }This can be directly derived from (alpha-beta)^{2}=(alpha+beta)^{2}-4 alpha beta.

The function f(x) will not have any extremum if its derivative f'(x) does not change sign, which means f'(x) geq 0 for all x. To ensure this, the discriminant of the quadratic derivative must be non-positive. Thus we have to ensure that the discriminant Delta associated with f'(x) is leq 0 for the parabola to remain above the x-axis at all times.The discriminant Delta of f'(x) is given by Delta = b^2 - 4ac, where a = 3, b = 6a, and c = 3(a+2) for the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0.After substituting the coefficients into the discriminant formula, we get Delta = (6a)^2 - 4 cdot 3 cdot 3(a+2) = 36a^2 - 36(a+2). For f'(x) geq 0 to hold, the discriminant Delta must be leq 0. Hence, 36a^2 - 36(a+2) leq 0. Simplifying this, we get 36a^2 - 36a - 72 leq 0,  a^2 - a - 2 leq 0.

The method is: draw two lines parallel to AB on either side of AB. As long as they are sufficiently close to AB, the strip between them will contain only the two colored points A and B.Let P be the convex hull of all colored points, and consider the following two cases.(1) Assume P has a red vertex, denoted as A. Then a line can be drawn to separate point A from all other colored points. This way, the remaining 2012 red points can be paired into 1006 pairs, and each pair can be separated from all other colored points using two parallel lines. Therefore, a total of 2013 lines can meet the requirement.(2) Assume all vertices of P are blue. Consider two adjacent vertices on P, denoted as A and B.

By the induction hypothesis, the remaining points can be separated using left[frac{n}{2}right]-1 lines. Now, re-include points A and B, and consider three cases.(1) If points A and B are the same color, then a line parallel to l can be drawn to separate points A and B from other colored points. Clearly, the left[frac{n}{2}right] lines thus obtained can meet the requirement.(2) If points A and B are different colors, but are separated by some already drawn line, then the line parallel to l also meets the requirement.(3) If points A and B are different colors and are in the same region after drawing the left[frac{n}{2}right]-1 lines. By the induction hypothesis, at least one color will have no other colored points in that region. Without loss of generality, assume the only blue point in that region is A.

Thus, d=pm 1, c=pm 1.For u, the only new value is u=1, so t^{4}=1, n^{2}=4, n=2, m=1, a^{2}=1, and k=3.Thus, the only choices for k are: k=1 and k=3.When k=1, we get a periodic sequence: 1,1, 0,1,1, 0, cdots, which satisfies the constraints of the problem.When k=3, the sequence is:y_{1}=y_{2}=1, y_{n+2}=7 y_{n+1}-y_{n}-2.Since y_{3}=4=2^{2}, y_{4}=25=5^{2}, y_{5}=169=13^{2}, we assume it is the square of the odd-indexed Fibonacci numbers.If left{u_{n}right} is the Fibonacci sequence, it is easy to see that u_{n+2}=3 u_{n}-u_{n-2}, and u_{n+2} u_{n-2}-u_{n}^{2}=1 for odd n.Thus, left(u_{n+2}+u_{n-2}right)^{2}=9 u_{n}^{2}.Therefore, u_{n+2}^{2}=9 u_{n}^{2}-u_{n-2}^{2}-2 u_{n+2} u_{n-2}=7 u_{n}^{2}-u_{n-2}^{2}-2.This confirms our assumption.Hence, k=1 and k=3."},{"problem":"From the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, three numbers are randomly selected.

Consider a graph ( G ) with ( n ) vertices, where each vertex represents a guest and an edge between two vertices indicates that the corresponding guests know each other. The problem can be rephrased as follows: Given that whenever vertices ( a ) and ( b ) are not connected, the subgraph of ( G ) spanned by ( N(a) cap N(b) ) is a clique, show that ( G ) has at most ( binom{n}{2} ) subgraphs which are maximal cliques. Here, ( N(v) ) denotes the set of neighbors of vertex ( v ), and a maximal clique is one which is not contained in any other clique.We will prove this result by induction on ( n ).1. Base Case: ( n = 1 )   - When ( n = 1 ), the graph ( G ) has only one vertex and no edges. The only maximal clique is the vertex itself. Thus, the number of maximal cliques is ( binom{1}{2} = 0 ), which satisfies the condition.2. Inductive Step:   - Suppose the hypothesis holds for ( n = k ). We need to show that it holds for ( n = k+1 ).   - Select an arbitrary vertex ( v ) in ( G ). Call a maximal clique in ( G setminus {v} ) a house. By the induction hypothesis, there are at most ( binom{k}{2} ) houses.   - We can classify all maximal cliques of ( G ) into three categories:     1. A house.     2. A house plus ( {v} ).     3. ( {v} ) plus a non-maximal clique of ( G setminus {v} ).3. Define Sets:   - Let ( S_1, S_2, S_3 ) be the sets of maximal cliques of ( G ) which fall into categories 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Clearly, ( S_1, S_2, S_3 ) are pairwise disjoint sets.4. Lemma 1: ( |S_1| + |S_2| le binom{k}{2} )   - Consider the following mapping from ( S_1 cup S_2 ) to the set ( H ) of houses. For a maximal clique in ( S_1 ), map it to itself. For a maximal clique in ( S_2 ), map it to the house obtained by removing ( {v} ).   - This map is injective because if a house ( h in H ) were mapped to twice, then ( h ) and ( h cup {v} ) would both be maximal cliques of ( G ), which is a contradiction since ( h ) would not be maximal in ( G ).5. Lemma 2: ( |S_3| le k )   - Let ( A cup {v} ) be a clique in ( S_3 ), where ( A ) is a non-maximal clique of ( G setminus {v} ). Let ( B ) be any house containing ( A ), and let ( w in B setminus A ) be a vertex.   - Since ( v ) and ( w ) are not connected, ( {v} cup (N(v) cap N(w)) ) is a clique, and ( A subseteq N(v) cap N(w) ). Thus, ( A = N(v) cap N(w) ) and ( {v} cup A = {v} cup (N(v) cap N(w)) ).   - This mapping from ( S_3 ) to vertices in ( G setminus {v} ) is injective, proving ( |S_3| le k ).6. Conclusion:   - Combining the results from Lemmas 1 and 2, we have:     [     |S_1| + |S_2| + |S_3| le binom{k}{2} + k = binom{k+1}{2}     ]   - By induction, the hypothesis holds for ( n = k+1 ).Thus, the problem is solved, and the number of maximal cliques in ( G ) is at most ( binom{n}{2} ).(blacksquare)The final answer is (boxed{frac{n(n-1)}{2}})"},{"problem":"Find all integers a such that 35 divides a^{3}-1.","solution":"We could proceed as above, examining one by one the 35 congruence classes modulo 35.

This means that for point A, f(alpha)=2, and for point B, f(beta)=0.2. Distance Between Points A and B: The distance formula between two points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) is sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}. Applying this to points A and B, we get |AB|=sqrt{(alpha-beta)^2+4}.3. Minimum Distance and Period Relationship: The problem states that the minimum value of |AB| is sqrt{4+frac{{pi}^{2}}{4}}. Setting sqrt{(alpha-beta)^2+4} = sqrt{4+frac{{pi}^{2}}{4}} and simplifying, we find that the minimum value of |alpha-beta| is frac{pi}{2}.

For the equation to have a root, the numerators must also be equal. Thus, we set the numerators equal to each other:1. because The equation is given as frac{x-2}{x+4} = frac{a}{x+4},2. therefore We equate the numerators: x-2 = a.However, before solving for a, we consider the condition given that the equation has a root.

Finding the center (a,b) of circle C:Given that the circle passes through (5,2), (1,6), and (1,2), we can find the center by averaging the x and y coordinates of the points that lie diametrically opposite to each other, which are (5,2) and (1,6).

Using point (5,2), we get:- r^{2} = (5-3)^{2} + (2-4)^{2} = 2^{2} + (-2)^{2} = 4 + 4 = 8Therefore, the equation of circle C is (x-3)^{2}+(y-4)^{2}=8.3. Evaluating each option:A: To find the maximum distance |AM_2|, we consider the farthest point A from M_2(-2,0) on the circle, which is directly opposite M_2 across the circle.

The minimum height h from A to M_1M_2 is when A is closest to M_1M_2, which is at a distance of 4-2sqrt{2} (the radius minus the segment inside the circle perpendicular to M_1M_2).

First, we check ((a, b) = (9, 10)):   [   9^3 + 10^3 = 729 + 1000 = 1729   ]   Factoring 1729:   [   1729 = 7 times 13 times 19   ]   Since 7 and 13 are less than 18, this does not satisfy the condition.5.

Initial Consideration:   Let's consider the maximum number of black horses that can be placed on the board. We need to ensure that each black horse can attack at most one other black horse. 3. Strategy:   We can use a pattern to place the black horses. One effective way is to place the black horses in a checkerboard pattern, but we need to ensure that no two black horses can attack more than one other black horse.4. Checkerboard Pattern:   Place black horses on every other square in a checkerboard pattern. This means placing black horses on all squares of one color (say, black squares) and white horses on the other color (white squares).5. Verification:   In a checkerboard pattern, each black horse is surrounded by white squares, and thus cannot attack another black horse. However, we need to ensure that no black horse can attack more than one other black horse.6. Detailed Placement:   Let's place black horses on the following positions:   - (1,1), (1,3), (1,5), (1,7)   - (3,1), (3,3), (3,5), (3,7)   - (5,1), (5,3), (5,5), (5,7)   - (7,1), (7,3), (7,5), (7,7)   This gives us a total of 16 black horses.7. Checking the Condition:   Each black horse can attack at most one other black horse. For example, the black horse at (1,1) can attack the black horse at (3,2) and vice versa. Similarly, the black horse at (1,3) can attack the black horse at (3,4) and vice versa. This pattern ensures that no black horse can attack more than one other black horse.8. Proof of Maximum:   To prove that more than 16 black horses cannot be placed without violating the condition, consider any 4x4 subgrid. If we place more than 4 black horses in any 4x4 subgrid, at least one black horse will be able to attack more than one other black horse due to the density of placement.   Therefore, the maximum number of black horses that can be placed on the chessboard such that no black horse can attack more than one other black horse is 16.The final answer is boxed{16}."},{"problem":"88.

A series of similar theorems on the partition of numbers into summands (including the theorems that form the content of problems 30a), b) and 31a)) is contained in Chapter XVI of Euler's remarkable book \\"Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinitely Small,\\" ONTI, M.-L., 1936.

Consider the segment (MN) of length (n). Each solution to the equationx_{1}+x_{2}+ldots+x_{m}=nin positive (respectively non-negative) integers corresponds to a partition of this segment into (m) smaller segments, the lengths of which are expressed in positive (non-negative) integers. This allows us to provide a new solution to our problems.a) The number of solutions to our equation in positive integers is equal to the number of ways to partition the segment (MN) into (m) smaller segments. If (M_{1}, M_{2}, ldots, M_{n-1}) are points on our segment such that (MM_{1}=cdots M_{1}M_{2}=ldots=M_{n-1}N=1) (Fig. 37), then the number of ways to partition the segment (MN) into (m) segments is, obviously, the number of ways to choose (m-1) points of division from the (n-1) points (M_{1}, M_{2}, ldots, M_{n-1}), i.e., it is equal to the number (C_{n-1}^{m-1}) of combinations of (n-1) elements taken (m-1) at a time.b) Similarly, the number of solutions to our equation in non-negative integers is equal to the number of ways to choose (m-1) points of division from the (n+1) points (M, M_{1}, M_{2}, ldots, M_{n-1}, N), which is equal to the number (C_{n+m-1}^{m-1}) of combinations of (n+1) elements taken (m-1) at a time (see the solution using generating functions for this problem).Note.

Establish the equation based on profit: The store's profit for selling each item is the selling price minus the purchase price, which is (a-30). The number of items sold is given by (112-2a). The total profit is the product of these two, which should equal 330 yuan. Therefore, we have the equation:      (a-30)(112-2a) = 330   2.

Since (s > t) and (s - t) is odd, we choose ((s - t, t) = (2, 1)), which gives:   [   s - t = 2 quad text{and} quad t = 1 implies s = 3   ]   Therefore, the sides of the triangle are:   [   (a, b, c) = (2 cdot 3 cdot 1, 3^2 - 1^2, 3^2 + 1^2) = (6, 8, 10)   ]   The area (A) is:   [   A = st(s^2 - t^2) = 3 cdot 1 cdot (3^2 - 1^2) = 3 cdot 1 cdot (9 - 1) = 3 cdot 8 = 24   ]5. Verify the minimum area:   We need to check if there is any smaller area. Assume (A_{min} < 24). Then (n > 1), and we have:   [   A = st(s - t)(s + t) = 2n^2s(s + t) geq 2 cdot 2^2 cdot 2 cdot (2 + 1) = 16 cdot 3 = 48   ]   This is a contradiction since (A_{min} < 24). Therefore, the minimum possible area is indeed 24.The final answer is (boxed{24})"},{"problem":"Given the complex number z= frac {1+bi}{2+i} where b in mathbb{R}, if z is a purely imaginary number, then the complex number z is boxed{text{answer}}.A: frac {3}{5}iB: - frac {3}{5}iC: -iD: i","solution":"The complex number z= frac {1+bi}{2+i}= frac {(1+bi)(2-i)}{(2+i)(2-i)}= frac {2+b+(2b-1)i}{5}.Since z is a purely imaginary number, 2+b=0 and 2b-1 neq 0.

Simplify the given expression:   - The original expression is (frac{x-3}{x^2-1}-frac{2}{x+1})div frac{x}{x^2-2x+1}.   - Notice that x^2-1 can be factored into (x+1)(x-1), and x^2-2x+1 can be rewritten as (x-1)^2.   - Thus, the expression becomes frac{x-3}{(x+1)(x-1)}-frac{2}{x+1}div frac{x}{(x-1)^2}.   - Combine the fractions in the numerator by finding a common denominator, which is (x+1)(x-1), and rewrite the subtraction as frac{x-3-2(x-1)}{(x+1)(x-1)}div frac{x}{(x-1)^2}.   - Simplify the numerator to get frac{x-3-2x+2}{(x+1)(x-1)}cdot frac{(x-1)^2}{x}.   - Further simplification gives frac{-x-1}{(x+1)(x-1)}cdot frac{(x-1)^2}{x}.   - This simplifies to frac{1-x}{x}.2. Evaluate the expression for x:   - Given x=(frac{1}{2})^{-1}+left(pi -1right)^{0}, we calculate x.   - (frac{1}{2})^{-1} = 2 because the reciprocal of frac{1}{2} is 2.   - left(pi -1right)^{0} = 1 because any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1.   - Therefore, x = 2 + 1 = 3.3.

Consequently, edges joining ( (3,0) ) to both ( (2,0) ) and ( (2,1) ) must be colored.   - Due to condition (2), the edge joining ( (2,1) ) and ( (3,1) ) must be colored, or the edge joining ( (3,0) ) and ( (3,1) ) is uncolored.   - This makes the scenario impossible for ( n = 3 ), as there would be an even number of colored edges meeting at ( A ).7. Impossibility for ( n > 3 ):   - If ( n > 3 ), the edge joining ( (3,0) ) and ( (4,0) ) must be left uncolored. This makes the triangle formed by these two vertices and ( (3,1) ) violate condition (1).   - Therefore, the scenario is not possible for ( n > 3 ).Conclusion:The scenario is only possible for ( n = 2 ).

Let's denote by p the probability of hitting the target with a single shot. Calculate the probability that the target will be hit, i.e., at least one hit will occur, in n shots.At the beginning of the section, it was noted that unlikely events can be considered practically impossible, and there are different degrees of such impossibility. Let's clarify this.If methods of probability theory are applied to study some real phenomenon, each time it is necessary to choose some small number varepsilon as the allowable probability of error. This means that, when predicting the course of a real phenomenon using methods of probability theory, we are forced to admit some possibility of error in our forecast and only require that the probability of error does not exceed varepsilon. With such an assumption, we have grounds to consider any event with a probability less than varepsilon as practically impossible, and any event with a probability greater than 1-varepsilon as practically certain. The number varepsilon can also be called the allowable degree (or level) of uncertainty, and the number 1-varepsilon the required degree (or level) of certainty. It is self-evident that the value of varepsilon is chosen in each specific problem with regard to practical requirements for the certainty of conclusions. Often used values are 0.01, 0.005, 0.001, 0.0001.Let's illustrate this with an example of the problem of the number of shots needed to hit the target (see problem 188). Suppose, for definiteness, the probability of hitting the target with each shot is 0.2. How many shots are needed to hit the target? Clearly, no absolutely certain number of shots can be specified: it may happen that the target is hit with the first shot, and at the same time, it is not excluded that, for example, 100 or 200 shots will not result in a single hit. Therefore, let's not strive for absolute certainty and introduce some allowable degree of uncertainty varepsilon. A practically acceptable value, for example, is varepsilon equal to 0.001. Asserting that the target will be hit with n shots, we will make an error with a probability of (1-0.2)^n = (0.8)^n (see the solution to problem 188). Now let's find n such that(0.8)^n < 0.001.The smallest value of n satisfying this inequality is 31 (it is easily found using logarithm tables). Thus, asserting that 31 shots are sufficient to hit the target, we can make an error with a probability not exceeding the allowable limit of 0.001. Therefore, under the accepted requirements for the level of certainty, hitting the target with 31 shots can be considered practically certain.The number of shots found will change if the allowable degree of uncertainty is changed. In the table below, the values of n corresponding to various allowable levels of uncertainty are given.| boldsymbol{n} | boldsymbol{n} || :---: | :---: || 0.01 | 21 || 0.005 | 24 || 0.001 | 31 || 0.0001 | 42 |Problem. Calculate the probability that a 6 will never appear in an unlimited number of rolls of a die.Solution. First, let's calculate the probability of the event B_n \\"a 6 does not appear in n rolls.\\" In solving problem 187, we found that mathbf{P}(B_6) = left(frac{5}{6}right)^6. Similarly, for any n (by formula (6))mathbf{P}(B_n) = left(frac{5}{6}right)^nLet's denote the event \\"a 6 never appears in an unlimited number of rolls of the die\\" by B. From the event B, each of the events B_1, B_2, ldots, B_n, ldots follows. Therefore, by the first property of probability,begin{aligned}& mathbf{P}(B) leqslant mathbf{P}(B_1) = frac{5}{6} & mathbf{P}(B) leqslant mathbf{P}(B_2) = left(frac{5}{6}right)^2 & cdots cdot cdot cdot cdot & mathbf{P}(B) leqslant mathbf{P}(B_n) = left(frac{5}{6}right)^nend{aligned}But the numbers frac{5}{6}, left(frac{5}{6}right)^2, ldots, left(frac{5}{6}right)^n, ldots as terms of a decreasing geometric progression become smaller than any preassigned positive number as n increases. Therefore, mathbf{P}(B) is also smaller than any positive number, i.e., mathbf{P}(B) = 0.Thus, the probability that a 6 will never appear in an unlimited number of rolls of the die is zero.Events we have encountered so far were either impossible or, if possible, had a probability greater than zero. Here we encounter an event with a probability of zero and yet it seems logically possible. We could not have obtained such a result if the probability of our event could be calculated by the rule given at the beginning of the section, namely as the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes of the experiment to the total number of all possible equally likely outcomes.1) A. P. Kiselev, Algebra, part 2, 23rd edition, p. 78.The result we obtained in solving our problem can also be interpreted as follows: no matter how high a degree of certainty we desire, we can specify a number of rolls such that the appearance of a 6 at least once will be practically certain. This is the real meaning of the assertion that a 6 will appear with probability 1 in an unlimited number of rolls of the die.The formula for total probability. A system of events A_1, A_2, A_3, ldots, A_n is called complete if at least one of them will definitely occur (in other words, if the event A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + ldots + A_n is certain). Note that if the events A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n form a complete system and are pairwise mutually exclusive, thenmathbf{P}(A_1) + mathbf{P}(A_2) + ldots + mathbf{P}(A_n) = 1(follows from formula (5) and property 4).Property 7 (formula for total probability). Let a complete system of pairwise mutually exclusive events A_1, A_2, A_3, ldots, A_n be given. Then the probability of any event B can be found by the formulabegin{array}{r}mathbf{P}(B) = mathbf{P}(A_1) mathbf{P}(B / A_1) + mathbf{P}(A_2) mathbf{P}(B / A_2) + ldots ldots + mathbf{P}(A_n) mathbf{P}(B / A_n)end{array}To prove this, note that since one of the events A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n will definitely occur, the occurrence of event B is equivalent to the occurrence of one of the events B A_1, B A_2, ldots, B A_n; therefore,mathbf{P}(B) = mathbf{P}((A_1 B) + (A_2 B) + ldots + (A_n B))Since the events A_1 B, A_2 B, ldots, A_n B are pairwise mutually exclusive (since A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n are pairwise mutually exclusive), by formula (5)mathbf{P}(B) = mathbf{P}(A_1 B) + mathbf{P}(A_2 B) + ldots + mathbf{P}(A_n B)Using property 6, we getmathbf{P}(B) = mathbf{P}(A_1) math","solution":"188.

Identify the range and common ratio:   We are given that the terms of the geometric progression (GP) must lie between 100 and 1000 inclusive, and the common ratio ( r ) is greater than 1. We need to find the maximum number of terms in such a GP.2. Assume a specific GP:   Let's consider a specific example where ( a = 128 ) and ( r = frac{3}{2} ). We need to check if the terms ( a, ar, ar^2, ldots, ar^5 ) lie within the given range ({100, 101, ldots, 1000}).

Assume a general GP with ratio ( r > 1 ):   Suppose there exists a GP with ratio ( r > 1 ) that contains 7 values in the set ({100, 101, ldots, 1000}). Let ( a ) be the smallest value in this GP, and let ( h ) be the smallest positive integer such that ( ar^h ) is also in the set.4. Properties of ( r ):   Since ( r > 1 ), ( r^h ) must be a rational number. For any ( k in mathbb{N} ) such that ( ar^k ) is in the set, we can write ( k = hq + l ) with ( q in mathbb{N}_0 ) and ( 0 leq l < h ). Then:   [   ar^l = frac{ar^k}{(r^h)^q} in mathbb{Q}   ]   This implies ( ar^l ) is an integer and ( a leq ar^l < ar^h ). By the choice of ( h ), we must have ( l = 0 ) and ( k = hq ). Therefore, the terms of the GP that lie in the set have the form ( ar^{hq} ) with ( q in mathbb{N}_0 ).5. Simplify the problem:   We can replace ( r ) with ( r^h ) and assume ( a, ar in {100, 101, ldots, 1000} ) and ( r in mathbb{Q} ).6. Express ( r ) as a fraction:   Let ( r = frac{m}{n} ) with ( m, n in mathbb{N} ), ( m > n ), and (gcd(m, n) = 1). Then:   [   ar^t = frac{a}{n^t} m^t in {100, 101, ldots, 1000}   ]   for some ( t in mathbb{N} ), ( t geq 6 ) by assumption. This implies ( n^t mid a ) and (frac{a}{n^t} geq 1).7. Analyze the constraints:   Since (gcd(m, n) = 1), for ( n geq 3 ), we get a contradiction:   [   ar^t geq m^t geq 4^6 > 1000   ]   For ( n = 1 ), we have ( m geq 2 ), and for ( n = 2 ), we have ( m geq 3 ). Thus, ( r geq frac{3}{2} ) and:   [   ar^t geq 100 left(frac{3}{2}right)^6 > 1000   ]   This is a contradiction.8.

Substituting the given values, we get:[S_{n} = frac{n}{2}[2 times 250 + (n-1) times 50] = 25n^{2} + 225n]We need to find when this cumulative area first exceeds 22.5 million square meters, so we set up the inequality:[25n^{2} + 225n geqslant 2250]Simplifying, we get:[n^{2} + 9n - 90 geqslant 0]Solving this quadratic inequality, we find that n geqslant 6.

Thus, the area of housing built in the n-th year is:[b_{n} = 400 cdot 1.08^{n-1}]From Part 1, we know the area of mid-to-low-priced houses built in the n-th year is a_{n} = 250 + (n-1) times 50.To find when the proportion of mid-to-low-priced houses exceeds 85% of the total area built that year, we set up the inequality:[250 + (n-1) times 50 > 0.85 times 400 times 1.08^{n-1}]Simplifying, we get:[200 + 50n > 340 times 1.08^{n-1}]Using the given approximations, we check for n=5 and n=6:- For n=5, 200 + 50 times 5 = 450 and 340 times 1.08^{4} approx 462.4, so 450  499.8.Therefore, the smallest positive integer n that satisfies the inequality is n=6, indicating that by the end of 2024, the proportion of mid-to-low-priced houses built that year will first exceed 85%.Final Answers:1.

We will now show that in the solution with the minimum number of moves, this number must have been 1011. In other words: whenever we can divide by 2 in our reverse reasoning, it is always the best.Suppose we first add 1 to 2022 a number of times before dividing by 2, say we add 1 n times and then divide by 2.

Find all subsets Ssubseteqmathbb Z/pmathbb Z such that1. if a,bin S, then abin S, and2. there exists an rin S such that for all ain S, we have r-ain Scup{0}.[i]Proposed by Harun Khan[/i]","solution":"1. Initial Subsets: We first note that the subsets ( S = emptyset, {0}, {1}, {0, 1} ) are all possible solutions. For ( S = {0, 1} ), we can take ( r = 1 ). These subsets trivially satisfy the given conditions.2. Condition 1 Analysis: The first condition states that if ( a, b in S ), then ( ab in S ). This implies that ( S setminus {0} ) must be closed under multiplication. Since ( (mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z})^times ) (the multiplicative group of nonzero elements modulo ( p )) is a finite group, ( S setminus {0} ) must be a subgroup of ( (mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z})^times ).3. Existence of 1 in ( S ): Since ( S setminus {0} ) is a subgroup of ( (mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z})^times ), it must contain the identity element, which is 1. Therefore, ( 1 in S ).4. Condition 2 Analysis: The second condition states that there exists an ( r in S ) such that for all ( a in S ), ( r - a in S cup {0} ). This implies that the map ( a mapsto r - a ) is a bijection from ( S setminus {0, r} ) to itself.5. Sum of Elements in ( S ): Let ( r ) be as in condition 2. By the bijection property, we have:   [   sum_{a in S setminus {0, r}} a = sum_{a in S setminus {0, r}} (r - a)   ]   This simplifies to:   [   sum_{a in S setminus {0, r}} a = mr - sum_{a in S setminus {0, r}} a   ]   where ( m = #(S setminus {0, r}) ). Therefore:   [   2 sum_{a in S setminus {0, r}} a = mr   ]   If ( r notin S ), then:   [   sum_{a in S setminus {0, r}} a = sum_{a in S} a = 0   ]   which implies:   [   mr = 0   ]   Since ( 0 < m < p ), we must have ( r = 0 ). Thus, ( 1 in S ) implies ( -1 in S ), and ( S ) is a subgroup of ( (mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z})^times ) containing ( -1 ).6. Case ( r in S ): If ( r in S ):   - If ( r = 0 ), then again ( -1 in S ) and ( S setminus {0} ) is a subgroup of ( (mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z})^times ) containing ( -1 ).   - If ( r neq 0 ), then:     [     sum_{a in S setminus {0, r}} a = left(sum_{a in S} aright) - r = -r     ]     This leads to:     [     (m + 2)r = 0     ]     and hence ( m + 2 = p ). Therefore, we have ( #(S setminus {0}) = p - 1 ), meaning ( S setminus {0} ) is equal to ( (mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z})^times ).Conclusion:The subsets ( S subseteq mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z} ) that satisfy the given conditions are those for which ( S setminus {0} ) is either a subset of ( {1} ) or a subgroup of ( (mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z})^times ) containing ( -1 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ S setminus {0} } ) is either a subset of ( {1} ) or a subgroup of ( (mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z})^times ) containing ( -1 )."},{"problem":"An ant is crawling from the left end of a 4 mathrm{~m} long rubber band towards the right end at a constant speed, covering exactly one meter per minute.

If we look at what fraction of the rubber band the ant has covered, this ratio does not change during the uniform stretching.

Therefore, there is only one solid that meets these conditions, as shown in the figure (on the next page).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_00bd711d6964fe66c468g-1.jpg?height=488&width=849&top_left_y=279&top_left_x=627)Due to the regularity of the triangles, it is true for every vertex of the hexagons that it is at an equal - unit - distance from two vertices of the other hexagon, meaning it lies in the perpendicular bisector plane of an edge of the other hexagon. Thus, these perpendicular bisector planes intersect each other in the line connecting the centers of the two hexagons. This line is perpendicular to the planes of the hexagons, so the midpoint of the segment connecting the centers of the two hexagons is equidistant from all vertices of the solid. This proves that a sphere can be circumscribed around the solid.Let the centers of the hexagons be denoted by T and S, the midpoint of TS - which is the center of the sphere - by O, two adjacent vertices of the hexagon centered at T by A and B, the third vertex of the triangular face containing the edge AB by G, the orthogonal projection of G onto the plane ABT by M, and the midpoint of AB by F. Then TF = GF = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} (the height of a regular triangle with unit side length), FM = TM - TF = SG - TF = 1 - frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. The triangle GMF is right-angled because GM is perpendicular to the plane TAB, and thus perpendicular to the line FM in that plane. Therefore, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem: GM = sqrt{GF^2 - FM^2} = sqrt{sqrt{3} - 1}. Due to the parallelism of the planes of the hexagons, ST = GM, so OT = frac{1}{2} sqrt{sqrt{3} - 1}. Finally, the desired radius can be determined from the right-angled triangle OTA using the Pythagorean theorem:OA = sqrt{OT^2 + TA^2} = sqrt{frac{1}{4}(sqrt{3} - 1) + 1} = frac{1}{2} sqrt{3 + sqrt{3}}Thus, a sphere can be circumscribed around the solid, and its radius is frac{1}{2} sqrt{3 + sqrt{3}} approx 1.088.Based on the work of Péter Hajdufi (Budapest, Baár-Madas Ref.

Define the problem and notation:   We need to calculate the distance    [   inf_{p,f}, max_{0le xle 1} |f(x)-p(x)|   ]   where ( p ) runs over polynomials of degree less than ( n ) with real coefficients and ( f ) runs over functions ( f(x)= sum_{k=n}^{infty} c_k x^k ) defined on the closed interval ([0,1]), where ( c_k ge 0 ) and (sum_{k=n}^{infty} c_k=1).2. Introduce the error function:   Let ( E_n(f)_{[0,1]} = inf_{p} sup_{x in [0,1]} |f(x) - p(x)| ), where the (inf) is taken over all polynomials of degree at most ( n ).3. Use Chebyshev polynomials:   Let ( T_n ) be the Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind, and let ( x_0 = -1, x_1, ldots, x_{n-1}, x_n = 1 ) be its oscillating points, where it takes alternatively values (pm 1). Define ( t_j = (x_j + 1)/2 ).4. Construct the polynomial ( Q_n(t) ):   The polynomial ( Q_n(t) = 2^{-2n+1} T_n(2t-1) ) has leading coefficient 1 and oscillates at the ( n+1 ) points ( t_j ). Thus, the polynomial ( R(t) = t^n - Q_n(t) ) is of degree ( n-1 ) and oscillates around ( t^n ) at ({t_j mid j=0,1,ldots,n} ).5. Apply Chebyshev equioscillation theorem:   By the Chebyshev equioscillation theorem, ( R(t) ) is the best possible uniform approximation on ([0,1]) of ( t^n ) with polynomials of degree at most ( n-1 ). The error of approximation is ( E_{n-1}(x^n)_{[0,1]} = 2^{-2n+1} ).6. Consider a specific function ( f(x) = x^n ):   If we take ( c_n = 1 ) and ( c_m = 0 ) for ( m > n ), we get that the required (inf) is less than or equal to ( 2^{-2n+1} ).7. Prove the exact value of the infimum:   We will prove that the infimum is exactly ( 2^{-2n+1} ) and is attained when ( f(x) = x^n ).8. Establish a lower bound for ( E_{n-1}(x^m)_{[0,1]} ):   We need to show that ( E_{n-1}(x^m)_{[0,1]} ge 2^{-2n+1} ) for all ( m > n ). Moreover, there exists a polynomial ( P^{(m)} ) of degree ( n-1 ) which equioscillates around ( x^m ) at the points ( t_j ) with error (at these points) greater than ( 2^{-2n+1} ).9. Interpolate ( x^m ) with polynomial ( L ):   Interpolate ( x^m ) with a polynomial ( L ) of degree ( n ) at the points ( t_j ), i.e., ( L(t_j) = t_j^m ) for ( j=0,ldots,n ). Denote by ( a ) the leading coefficient of ( L ) and consider the polynomial ( P^{(m)} = L(t) - a Q_n(t) ).10. Analyze the polynomial ( P^{(m)} ):    This polynomial is of degree at most ( n-1 ) and equioscillates around ( t^m ), i.e., ( t^m - P^{(m)}(t) ) is alternatively (pm a) at the points ( t = t_j ).11. Prove that ( |a| > 1 ):    By Newton interpolation representation, ( a = t^m[t_0,t_1,ldots,t_n] ), where the last term means the divided difference of the function ( t^m ) at the points ( (t_j) ). We know that ( x^n[t_0,t_1,ldots,t_n] = 1 ).12. Use the Leibniz rule:    Using the Leibniz rule:    [    (f cdot g)[t_0,t_1,ldots,t_n] = f[t_0] cdot g[t_0,ldots,t_n] + f[t_0,t_1] cdot g[t_1,ldots,t_n] + ldots + f[t_0,ldots,t_n] g[t_n]    ]    and plugging ( g(t) = t ) and ( f(t) = t^n ), we get:    [    t^{n+1}[t_0,t_1,ldots,t_n] = t^n[t_1,t_2,cdots,t_n] > 1    ]13. Conclude the inequality:    The last inequality follows from the fact that:    [    1 = t^n[t_0,t_1,ldots,t_n] = frac{t^n[t_1,ldots,t_n] - t^n[t_0,t_1,ldots,t_{n-1}]}{t_n - t_0} = t^n[t_1,ldots,t_n] - t^n[t_0,t_1,ldots,t_{n-1}]    ]    and also ( t^n[t_0,ldots,t_{n-1}] = (t^n)^{(n-1)}(xi)/(n-1)! > 0 ), here ( xi in (t_0,t_{n-1}) ).14. Generalize for ( m > n ):    In the same way, it follows consecutively that ( t^m[t_0,t_1,ldots,t_n] > 1 ) for all ( m > n ).15. Consider a general function ( f = sum_{k=n}^m c_k x^k ):    Consider the polynomial ( sum_{j=n}^m c_j P^{(j)}(t) ), where ( P^{(j)} ) is as above. It is of degree at most ( n-1 ) and oscillates around ( f ) at the points ( t_0, t_1, ldots, t_n ) with error (at these points) ( sum_{j=n}^m c_j text{err}_j ), where ( text{err}_n = 2^{-2n+1} ) and ( text{err}_j > 2^{-2n+1} ) for ( j > n ).16. Conclude the infimum:    Hence, if some ( c_j > 0 ) for ( j > n ), we can make the error more than ( 2^{-2n+1} ). According to the Chebyshev equioscillation theorem, ( E_{n-1}(f)_{[0,1]} ge 2^{-2n+1} ).

Hence, alpha could be in the second or fourth quadrant based on the sign of tan alpha alone.   - cos alpha < 0 indicates that alpha must be in either the second or third quadrant, or it could be positioned on the negative half-axis of the x-axis, where cos alpha is negative.Combining both conditions:  - From tan alpha < 0, we deduce that alpha could lie in the second or fourth quadrant.  - From cos alpha < 0, we deduce that alpha could lie in the second or third quadrant or along the negative half-axis of the x-axis.

With these new variables, we notice that a + 2b equals the sum 4x + 3y, which is given as 1. Therefore, we have the equation a + 2b = 1.The expression we want to minimize can be rewritten using a and b as follows:[frac{1}{2x - y} + frac{2}{x + 2y} = frac{1}{a} + frac{2}{b}.]Given a + 2b = 1, we can express the sum of these fractions as a function of a and b:[left( frac{1}{a} + frac{2}{b} right)(a + 2b) = 5 + frac{2b}{a} + frac{2a}{b}.]To find the minimum value of this expression, we apply the AM-GM inequality to the terms frac{2b}{a} and frac{2a}{b}, which yields:[5 + frac{2b}{a} + frac{2a}{b} geq 5 + 2sqrt{frac{2b}{a} cdot frac{2a}{b}} = 5 + 2sqrt{4} = 9.]The equality condition for the AM-GM inequality is frac{2b}{a} = frac{2a}{b}.

Substitute ( y = 0 ) into the functional equation:   [ f(x - f(0)) = x f(0) - 0 f(x) + g(x) ]   Since ( f(0) = 0 ), this simplifies to:   [ f(x) = g(x) ]   Therefore, ( f(x) = g(x) ) for all ( x ).2. Substitute ( x = 0 ) into the functional equation:   [ f(0 - f(y)) = 0 f(y) - y f(0) + g(0) ]   Since ( f(0) = 0 ) and ( f(x) = g(x) ), this simplifies to:   [ f(-f(y)) = 0 ]   This implies that ( f(-f(y)) = 0 ) for all ( y ).3.

This sum cannot be less than 18, because no matter what the following two-digit numbers are, their sum will be less than 200, meaning the maximum carry is 1. Therefore, we can conclude that the sum of the digits in the \\"hundreds\\" place is 18, and the sum of the following two-digit numbers must carry 1.

Then, we'll add them together to find the total number of different lunch combinations per day.Case 1: Choose two meat dishes, two vegetable dishes, and white rice.  For the meat dishes, we have 4 different options and need to choose 2. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}, where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.  Thus, the number of ways to choose the meat dishes is C_{4}^{2} = frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6.  For the vegetable dishes, we have 7 options and need to choose 2. Using the combination formula again, we get C_{7}^{2} = frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!} = 21.

Using the angle addition formula for cosine, we have:[cos(theta + 60^circ) = cos theta cos 60^circ - sin theta sin 60^circ = frac{1}{2} cos theta - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} sin theta]4. Substituting this into the Law of Cosines equation:[s^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab left( frac{1}{2} cos theta - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} sin theta right)]5.

Since the tourists will gain the most time if they arrive at the final destination simultaneously, we have the equation:frac{x}{20}+frac{12-x}{5}=frac{x}{5}+frac{12-x}{20}, text { from which } x=6Thus, the tourists can complete the entire journey without being late if each of them rides the bicycle for half the distance (6 km) and walks the other half.

Understanding the problem: We need to find the sum of all ( k leq 25 ) such that a ( k times k ) square can be completely covered with ( T ) tetrominos without any overlap. A tetromino is a shape made up of 4 squares.2. Analyzing the tetromino: Each tetromino covers exactly 4 unit squares. Therefore, for a ( k times k ) square to be completely covered by tetrominos, the total number of unit squares in the square, ( k^2 ), must be divisible by 4. This implies:   [   k^2 equiv 0 pmod{4}   ]   Since ( k^2 equiv 0 pmod{4} ), ( k ) itself must be divisible by 2. However, we need to check further conditions to ensure complete coverage.3. Checking for ( k ) values: We need to check which values of ( k ) (where ( k leq 25 )) satisfy the condition ( k^2 equiv 0 pmod{4} ). These values are:   [   k = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24   ]   However, we need to ensure that these values can indeed be covered by tetrominos without any gaps or overlaps.4. Verifying the coverage: For a ( k times k ) square to be completely covered by tetrominos, ( k ) must be a multiple of 4. This is because a ( 2 times 2 ) square cannot be covered by tetrominos without leaving gaps.

Denote by  r(x)  ( x in S ) the smallest positive integer such that  f^{r(x)}(x) = x . Then  r(x) leq 5  and  r(x) mid 50 , so  r(x) in {1, 2, 5} .

Claim 1: There exists a real number ( x_0 ) such that ( f(x_0) = 0 ).   Proof: Consider the equation ( x^3 + x f(0) + f(0) = 0 ). This is a cubic polynomial in ( x ), and by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, it has at least one real root. Let ( x_0 ) be such a root. Then, ( x_0^3 + x_0 f(0) + f(0) = 0 ). Since ( (x_0, 0, 0) ) is a valid triple, we have ( f(x_0)^3 + 0 cdot f(x_0) + 0 = 0 ), which simplifies to ( f(x_0)^3 = 0 ). Therefore, ( f(x_0) = 0 ). (blacksquare)2. Claim 2: ( f(0) = 0 ).   Proof: Consider the valid triple ( (0, y, x_0) ) where ( x_0 ) satisfies ( f(x_0) = 0 ). Then, we have ( f(0)^3 + y f(0) + x_0 = 0 ). Since ( f(x_0) = 0 ), this simplifies to ( f(0)^3 + y f(0) = 0 ). For this to hold for all ( y in mathbb{R} ), it must be that ( f(0) = 0 ). (blacksquare)3. Claim 3: ( f ) is injective.   Proof: Suppose ( f(a) = f(b) ). Consider a valid triple ( (x, y, a) ). Then, ( x^3 + f(y) x + f(a) = 0 ). Since ( f(a) = f(b) ), ( (x, y, b) ) is also valid, so ( x^3 + f(y) x + f(b) = 0 ). This implies ( f(x)^3 + y f(x) + a = 0 ) and ( f(x)^3 + y f(x) + b = 0 ). Therefore, ( a = b ), proving injectivity. (blacksquare)4. Claim 4: ( f ) is surjective.   Proof: Fix an arbitrary ( t in mathbb{R} ). Consider the polynomial ( P(X) = (X - t)(X^2 + tX + (1 + t^2)) ). Set ( z_0 = -t(1 + t^2) ) and ( y_0 = 1 ). Let ( x_0 ) be a real number such that ( (x_0, y_0, z_0) ) is valid. Then, ( P(x_0) = f(x_0)^3 + y_0 f(x_0) + z_0 = 0 ). Since ( P ) has exactly one real root ( t ), we conclude ( f(x_0) = t ), establishing surjectivity. (blacksquare)5. Claim 5: For all ( y ge 0 ), we have ( f(y) ge 0 ).   Proof: Suppose for contradiction that there exists ( y_0 > 0 ) such that ( f(y_0) < 0 ). Let ( x_0 ) be a solution to ( x^2 = -f(y_0) ). Then, ( (x_0, y_0, 0) ) is valid, so ( f(x_0)^3 + y_0 f(x_0) = 0 ). This cannot occur since ( x_0 neq 0 ) implies ( f(x_0) neq 0 ) by injectivity, and ( f(x_0)^2 + y_0 > 0 ). This contradiction implies ( f(y) ge 0 ) for all ( y ge 0 ). (blacksquare)6. Claim 6: ( f ) is additive.   Proof: Fix any three distinct real numbers ( a, b, c ) such that ( a + b + c = 0 ). Since ( f ) is surjective, we can choose real numbers ( y_0, z_0 ) such that ( a, b, c ) are the roots of the polynomial ( f(X) = X^3 + X f(y) + f(z) = 0 ). Since ( f(a), f(b), f(c) ) are distinct real numbers, they are the roots of the equation ( X^3 + y X + z = 0 ). It follows that ( f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = 0 ). For all real numbers ( a, b ), we get ( f(-(a + b)) = -(f(a) + f(b)) ). Setting ( b = 0 ), we get ( f(-x) = -f(x) ) for all ( x ), yielding ( f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b) ) for all distinct reals ( a, b ). For ( a = b ), consider ( f(2a) = f(a + m) + f(a - m) = (f(a) + f(m)) + (f(a) - f(m)) = 2f(a) ), where ( m ) is sufficiently large. Thus, ( f ) is completely additive. (blacksquare)7. Claim 7: ( f ) is the identity function.   Proof: By Claims 5 and 6, ( f ) is additive and bounded on an interval, so ( f ) is linear. Since ( f(0) = 0 ), we get ( f(x) = cx ) for all ( x ). Notice that ( c neq 0 ), so from a valid triple ( (1, y, z) ), we get ( z = left(frac{-1}{c} - yright) = -c^3 - cy ). This fails to hold for ( y rightarrow infty ) unless ( c = 1 ), in which case we are done.

Let d be the greatest common divisor of the numbers a and b. Thus, a = d m and b = d n, where m and n are coprime natural numbers. Since a b = d^2 m n is a perfect square and m and n are coprime, m and n must also be perfect squares. Write m = x^2 and n = y^2, where x and y are natural numbers. It follows that 101 = a - b = d(x + y)(x - y). Since 101 is a prime number and x + y geq 2, it must be that d = x - y = 1 and x + y = 101. From these, we calculate x = 51 and y = 50, so a = 51^2 = 2601 and b = 50^2 = 2500.2. way. Let d be the greatest common divisor of the numbers a and b. Since d divides 101 and 101 is a prime number, d can only be 1 or 101.If d = 1, then a and b are coprime numbers. Since a b is a perfect square, it follows that a and b are also perfect squares. Write a = x^2 and b = y^2, where x and y are natural numbers. Then 101 = a - b = x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y), from which it follows that x - y = 1 and x + y = 101, since 101 is a prime number and x + y geq 2. From these two equations, we easily calculate x = 51 and y = 50, so a = 51^2 = 2601 and b = 50^2 = 2500.If d = 101, we can write a = 101 m and b = 101 n, where m and n are coprime natural numbers. Since a b = 101^2 m n is a perfect square and m and n are coprime, it follows that m and n are also perfect squares. Write m = u^2 and n = v^2, where u and v are natural numbers. Then 101 = a - b = 101(m - n) = 101(u^2 - v^2) = 101(u + v)(u - v), which is a contradiction, since u + v geq 2.The only solution to the problem is thus the pair a = 2601 and b = 2500.3. way. Write a = b + 101 and calculate a b = b(b + 101) = n^2 for some natural number n. From this, we express n^2 - b^2 = (n - b)(n + b) = 101 b. Since 101 is a prime number, 101 mid (n - b) or 101 mid (n + b). We consider both possibilities.If 101 mid (n - b), we can write n - b = 101 k for some natural number k. From the equation (n - b)(n + b) = 101 b, it follows that k n = b(1 - k), which is a contradiction, since the left side of the equation is strictly positive, while the right side is less than or equal to zero.If 101 mid (n + b), we can write n + b = 101 l for some natural number l. From the equation (n - b)(n + b) = 101 b, it follows that l(101 l - 2 b) = b, or 101 l^2 = b(2 l + 1), from which we express b = frac{101 l^2}{2 l + 1}, which must be a natural number. Therefore, 2 l + 1 divides 101 l^2. Since 101 is a prime number, it must be that (2 l + 1) mid 101, so we can write 101 = (2 l + 1) c, where c in mathbb{N}. Since 2 l + 1 > 1, it must be that c = 1 and 2 l + 1 = 101. From this, we calculate l = 50 and b = 50^2 = 2500.

In (3), however, each term is the product of two different unknowns, but the possible products x z and y u are missing, making this equation symmetric in the pairs x, z and y, u.

None can be negative, because due to (4), the number of negatives can only be even, but due to (1), the negativity of all four is not possible, and two cannot be negative, because then, according to our previous finding (by making the two with absolute value 3 positive and the two with absolute value 1 negative), the left side of (1) would be maximally 3+3-1-1=4.

How many natural numbers n exist for which 4^{n}-15 is a square of an integer?","solution":"Answer. Two.Solution. Let 4^{n}-15=x^{2}, where x is an integer. It is obvious that x neq 0. If x is negative, then (-x)^{2} is also equal to 4^{n}-15; therefore, we will assume that 4^{n}-15=x^{2}, where x is a natural number. From the equation 2^{2 n}-15=x^{2}, we get: 2^{2 n}-x^{2}=15, and using the formula for factoring the difference of squares: left(2^{n}-xright)left(2^{n}+xright)=15. Since x is a natural number, the second factor on the left in the last equation is positive, and therefore the first factor must also be positive. The number 15 can be factored into natural numbers in two ways: 15=3 cdot 5=1 cdot 15. Since x>0, we have 2^{n}+x>2^{n}-x. Thus, there are only two possible cases:left{begin{array}{l}2^{n}-x=1,  2^{n}+x=15end{array}right. or left{begin{array}{l}2^{n}-x=3,  2^{n}+x=5 .end{array}right.Solving the first system of equations (it is most convenient to simply add the equations), we get that 2 cdot 2^{n}=16, i.e., n=3.

Solution The first point to notice is that if no arrangement is possible for n, then no arrangement is possible for any higher integer. Clearly the four points of a square work for n = 4, so we focus on n = 5. If the 5 points form a convex pentagon, then considering the quadrilateral A 1 A 2 A 3 A 4 as made up of two triangles in two ways, we have that r 1 + r 3 = r 2 + r 4 . Similarly, A 5 A 1 A 2 A 3 gives r 1 + r 3 = r 2 + r 5 , so r 4 = r 5 . We show that we cannot have two r's equal (whether or not the 4 points form a convex pentagon). For suppose r 4 = r 5 . Then A 1 A 2 A 4 and A 1 A 2 A 5 have equal area. If A 4 and A 5 are on the same side of the line A 1 A 2 , then since they must be equal distances from it, A 4 A 5 is parallel to A 1 A 2 . If they are on opposite sides, then the midpoint of A 4 A 5 must lie on A 1 A 2 . The same argument can be applied to A 1 and A 3 , and to A 2 and A 3 . But we cannot have two of A 1 A 2 , A 1 A 3 and A 2 A 3 parallel to A 4 A 5 , because then A 1 , A 2 and A 3 would be collinear. We also cannot have the midpoint of A 4 A 5 lying on two of A 1 A 2 , A 1 A 3 and A 2 A 3 for the same reason. So we have established a contradiction. hence no two of the r's can be equal. In particular, this shows that the 5 points cannot form a convex pentagon. Suppose the convex hull is a quadrilateral. Without loss of generality, we may take it to be A 1 A 2 A 3 A 4 . A 5 must lie inside one of A 1 A 2 A 4 and A 2 A 3 A 4 . Again without loss of generality we may take it to be the latter, so that A 1 A 2 A 5 A 4 is also a convex quadrilateral. Then r 2 + r 4 = r 1 + r 3 and also = r 1 + r 5 . So r 3 = r 5 , giving a contradiction as before. The final case is the convex hull a triangle, which we may suppose to be A 1 A 2 A 3 . Each of the other two points divides its area into three triangles, so we have: (r 1 + r 2 + r 4 ) + (r 2 + r 3 + r 4 ) + (r 3 + r 1 + r 4 ) = (r 1 + r 2 + r 5 ) + (r 2 + r 3 + r 5 ) + (r 3 + r 1 + r 5 ) and hence r 4 = r 5 , giving a contradiction.

This means it can be expressed as the square of a binomial. Given: [4x^{2}+2kx+9]We know that a perfect square trinomial takes the form (ax + b)^2 = a^2x^2 + 2abx + b^2. Comparing this with our given trinomial, we can deduce that a^2 = 4, which gives us a = 2 (since a is the coefficient of x^2 in both the given trinomial and the square of the binomial). Thus, our binomial takes the form (2x + b)^2. Expanding this, we get:[(2x + b)^2 = 4x^2 + 4bx + b^2]Comparing the given trinomial 4x^2 + 2kx + 9 with the expanded form 4x^2 + 4bx + b^2, we can see that b^2 = 9 and 4b = 2k.

In how many ways can the points be paired so that the paired points can be connected by lines lying within the half-plane and not intersecting each other?","solution":"Let a_{i} denote the number of connection possibilities when i points are given on the boundary line of a half-plane. Our task is then to determine a_{10}. Let's number the points from 1 to 10 in a certain direction along the line. There cannot be an odd number of points between two connected points, because then we could not pair them up in a way that satisfies the conditions. Therefore, a_{10} can be expressed by distinguishing the cases where the first point is connected to the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, or tenth point.If the first point is connected to the second, the remaining eight points can be paired in a_{8} ways. If the first point is connected to the fourth, the number of ways to connect the points between the first and fourth points - which can only be connected to each other - must be multiplied by the number of ways to connect the remaining six points: a_{2} cdot a_{6}. Similarly, for the other three cases, the number of possibilities is a_{4} cdot a_{4}, a_{6} cdot a_{2}, and a_{8}. Thus:a_{10}=a_{8}+a_{2} cdot a_{6}+a_{4} cdot a_{4}+a_{6} cdot a_{2}+a_{8}Similarly, we get thata_{8}=a_{6}+a_{2} cdot a_{4}+a_{4} cdot a_{2}+a_{6}, a_{6}=a_{4}+a_{2} cdot a_{2}+a_{4}, a_{4}=a_{2}+a_{2}It is obvious that two points can be paired in one way, so a_{2}=1.

Therefore, there are two possibilities left:1) n has the third digit equal to zero; the decimal representation of n is of the form n=a b 0, n_{0}=a b and n_{0} mid n for any choice of a in{1, ldots, 9} and b in{0,1, ldots, 9}. Relative to this case, there are thus 9 times 10=90 possibilities for n.2) n has the third digit different from zero but the second digit equal to zero; in this case n is written in the form a 0 b and n_{0} in the form a b. Recalling the meaning of the decimal representation, we seek the cases where 10 a+b divides 100 a+b. Since 10 a+b certainly divides 10(10 a+b)=100 a+10 b, it is also equivalent to see when 10 a+b divides the difference (100 a+10 b)-(10 a+b)=9 b.Writing k(10 a+b)=100 a+b and considering the last decimal digit, we obtain that (k-1) b is divisible by 10, so at least one of k-1 and b is divisible by 5. Since obviously 1<k<10 and 1 leq b leq 9, we have that k-1=5 or b=5.For k-1=5 we get 60 a+6 b=100 a+b, from which b=8 a and thus a=1, b=8. It is verified that n=108 is indeed a solution, as 18 divides 108.For b=5 we use the equivalent property that 10 a+b divides 9 b, which becomes 10 a+5 divides 45; it is immediately seen that the divisors of 45 of the form 10 a+5 with a geq 1 are 15 and 45, giving the two solutions n=105 (15 divides 105) and n=405 (45 divides 405).In conclusion, there are 90 solutions in case 1) and 3 solutions in case 2), for a total of 93 solutions."},{"problem":"Example 2 (2007 Guangzhou First Mock Exam for Science) Given a, b>0, and a+b=1, then the minimum value of 1 / 2a + 1 / b is qquad","solution":"Given: because a, b>0, and a+b=1, by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we know:frac{1}{2 a}+frac{1}{b}=frac{(sqrt{2} / 2)^{2}}{a}+frac{1^{2}}{b} geqslant frac{(sqrt{2} / 2)^{2}}{a+b}=frac{3}{2}+sqrt{2} text {, }with equality if and only if frac{sqrt{2} / 2}{a}=frac{1}{b}, i.e., a=sqrt{2}-1, b=2-sqrt{2},thus the minimum value of 1 / 2 a+1 / b is 3 / 2+sqrt{2}."},{"problem":"Jenny and Kenny are walking in the same direction, Kenny at 3 feet per second and Jenny at 1 foot per second, on parallel paths that are 200 feet apart.

Using the Pythagorean Theorem:   - The building is 100 feet in diameter, so the radius is 50 feet.   - The distance between the paths is 200 feet, so the distance from the center of the building to each path is 100 feet.   - When the building first blocks their line of sight, the distance between them is 200 feet.   - We need to find the time ( t ) when they can see each other again.4.

A common approach is to utilize the parametric equation of the ellipse.Using the parametric equation of the ellipse, we can solve the problem. From the standard equation of the ellipse, we can derive its parametric equation. Let's denote an arbitrary point on the ellipse as (4cosalpha, 2sinalpha).

Therefore, 317 leqslant n leqslant 999.The sum of all digits from 1 to 9 is 45 and is divisible by 9, so n+n^{2} is also divisible by 9. Since n+n^{2}=n(n+1) is the product of two consecutive numbers, it is divisible by 9 only in two cases: 1) n is divisible by 9; 2) n+1 is divisible by 9, i.e., n has a remainder of 8 when divided by 9.The first such numbers greater than 316 are 323 and 324.

We say that village A is stronger than village B if a fighter from village A wins at least k of the 400 fights.It turns out that each village is stronger than its neighboring village in a clockwise direction. Determine the maximum value of k so that this can be the case.Answer: The maximum value is k=290.## Solution:","solution":"We first give a construction and then prove that more than 290 is not possible. O.B.d.A we can assume that the fighters have strengths 1 to 400, and we number the villages clockwise from one to twenty.Construction: In the first village live the fighters of strength 400,190, 189, 188, . . In the second village live 399,398, 171,170,..,157, 156, and so on, in the last village live the fighters 210,209,...,192,191. To put it more clearly, we first distribute the fighters with strength greater than 190 to the villages, into the first village 400, into the second village 399, 398, into the third village 397, 396, 395, etc.. Then we fill the villages with fighters with a maximum strength of 190, into the first village 190,..,172, into the second village 171, ldots, 156, etc.Note that village x has just x fighters with strength greater than 190 and 20-x fighters with strength less than 191. For x in{1, ldots, 19} the fighters with strength greater than 190 win against all fighters of village x+1. The fighters with strength less than 191 win against the fighters with strength less than 191 in the next village, so they each win (20-(x+1)) times. In total, village x wins 20 x+(20-x)(20-(x+1)) times. The calculation shows that each of these villages wins at least 290 times. Now let's look at the twentieth village. Its fighters win against nineteen fighters from village one, so the twentieth village wins more than 290 times. Thus k=290 is possible.Upper bound: Assume that k>290 goes. We call fighters with a maximum strength of 200 weak. There are 200 weak fighters and twenty villages, so there is at least one village that has at least 10 weak fighters. We count how many times this village can win. The remaining fighters in the village win a maximum of 10 cdot 20=200 times. This means that the 10 weak fighters must win at least 91 times. The next step is that at least one of the 10 weak fighters must win 10 times. Consequently, the following village also has at least 10 weak fighters. Using the same argument, we conclude in turn that each village has at least 10 weak fighters. It also follows from the argument that the strongest of the weak fighters must be stronger than the strongest of the weak fighters from the following village, otherwise he cannot win 10 times. However, since we can apply the argument in turn, it also follows that the strongest of the weak fighters in the first village must be stronger than himself, which is not possible.

For any other vertex z in G, if the shortest path from x to z has an odd length, then let z in Y; if the shortest path from x to z has an even length, then let z in X.At this point, it is easy to verify that no two vertices in X are adjacent, and no two vertices in Y are adjacent (otherwise, there would be a cycle of odd length in the graph).If there are still vertices not connected to x, then take one of them as a new x and continue the partitioning process as described above until all vertices are partitioned into X and Y.Thus, G=X+Y is a bipartite graph."},{"problem":"4.

Find all natural numbers n whose set of proper divisors (i.e., all divisors except n) can be divided into two disjoint sets, each containing at least 2 elements, such that one set contains consecutive Fibonacci numbers, and the other set contains consecutive triangular numbers.## First Grade - B Category","solution":"4. We will call the set of consecutive triangular numbers T, and the set of Fibonacci numbers F. Assuming that 1 in T. Then 3 in T. If 6 in T, it follows that 2 in T (because then 2 is also a divisor of the number n, and its consecutive Fibonacci numbers, 1 and 3, are not in F), however, since 2 is not a triangular number, it follows that 6 notin T, thus we get T={1,3}. Now, if we have two consecutive Fibonacci numbers F_{k} and F_{k+1} in F, then either 3 F_{k} or 3 F_{k+1} must also belong to the set F, because at least one of these two numbers is a proper divisor of the number n (at most one of F_{k}, F_{k+1} is divisible by 3, so if for example 3 nmid F_{k}, then 3 F_{k} mid n, but it cannot be 3 F_{k}=n because F_{k+1} mid n but F_{k+1} nmid 3 F_{k}). However, for any Fibonacci number F_{l}>1, the number 3 F_{l} cannot be a Fibonacci number due to: F_{l+3}=2 F_{l+1}+F_{l}>3 F_{l}>2 F_{l}+F_{l-1}=F_{l+2}. It follows that 1 notin T.Thus, 1 in F. Then 2 in F must also be true. Suppose first F={1,2}. Let t be the smallest number in T. Then t is a prime number, because otherwise some proper divisor of the number t different from 1 and 2 (such a number definitely exists due to t neq 4, since 4 is not a triangular number) would be a proper divisor of the number n, and would be either in F or in T, but neither is possible. However, it is easy to see that 3 is the only triangular prime number. Thus, 3 in T, and then 6 in T. If 10 in T as well, then 5 is neither a triangular number nor can it be in F because 3 notin F, which is a contradiction. If only T={3,6}, it follows that 6 is a proper divisor of the number n, so n must be divisible by at least one more prime number different from 2 (since 4 notin T, F), but then there would exist a proper divisor of the number n greater than 6, a contradiction.Thus, we also have 3 in F. Then 6 in T (because 6 mid n and n>6, and 6 is not a Fibonacci number), and then 10 in T, so 5 mid n, and thus 15 in T (a proper divisor, and not a Fibonacci number). If 21 in T as well, then 7 would be a divisor of the observed number, but it is neither a Fibonacci number nor a triangular number. It follows that T={6,10,15}, and from there F={1,2,3,5} (we cannot have 8 in F because 4 is neither a Fibonacci number nor a triangular number) and finally n=30, which is the number that satisfies the conditions of the problem, and it is the only solution to the problem.## First Grade - B Category"},{"problem":"Given that all terms of the geometric sequence {a_n} are positive, and a_1 = 3, the sum of the first three terms is 21.

Substituting a_1 = 3 into the equation, we get 3 + 3r + 3r^2 = 21. Simplifying, we have 1 + r + r^2 = 7. The sum of the fourth, fifth, and sixth terms can be expressed as a_4 + a_5 + a_6 = a_1r^3 + a_1r^4 + a_1r^5 = 3r^3(1 + r + r^2). Since we know that 1 + r + r^2 = 7, we can substitute this value into the equation to get 3r^3 times 7 = 21r^3. To find the value of r^3, we notice that the sum of the first three terms, which is 21, can also be expressed as a_1(1 + r + r^2) = 3 times 7 = 21. Therefore, the sum of the fourth, fifth, and sixth terms is 21r^3. Since the sum of the first three terms is equal to the sum of the next three terms multiplied by r^3, and we know the sum of the first three terms is 21, we can deduce that r^3 = 2^3 = 8.

The distance d from a point P(x,frac{1}{2}e^x) on the curve y = frac{1}{2}e^x to the line y = x is given by:d = frac{|frac{1}{2}e^x - x|}{sqrt{2}}.Define a function g(x) = frac{1}{2}e^x - x for x > 0. Its derivative is:g'(x) = frac{1}{2}e^x - 1.We determine the intervals of increase and decrease for g(x) by examining g'(x):g'(x) geq 0 implies x geq ln(2),andg'(x) < 0 implies 0 < x < ln(2).Therefore, g(x) is monotonically decreasing in the interval (0, ln 2) and monotonically increasing in [ln 2, +infty). At x = ln 2, we have g_{text{min}} = 1 - ln 2, which implies the minimum distance d_{min} = frac{1 - ln 2}{sqrt{2}}.

We need to find the smallest possible number of terms with a non-zero coefficient in a simple n-th degree polynomial P(x) such that all values at integer places are divisible by n. A simple polynomial has coefficients in {-1, 0, 1}.2. We start by noting that a polynomial with only one non-zero term cannot satisfy the condition for all integer values, as it would not be divisible by n for all integers. Therefore, the number of non-zero terms must be at least 2.3. We will now construct a polynomial with exactly 2 non-zero terms and show that it satisfies the given condition.

Understanding the Problem:   We are given a directed graph (tournament) with 2013 vertices where there is exactly one directed edge between any two vertices. We need to find the maximum number ( k ) such that from any vertex, we can reach ( k ) other vertices using at most two edges.2. Initial Claim:   We claim that the maximum value of ( k ) is 2012. This means that from any vertex, we can reach all other 2012 vertices using at most two edges.3. Constructing Suitable Tournaments:   We start by constructing a suitable tournament on 3 vertices. Consider vertices ( a, b, ) and ( c ) with edges ( overrightarrow{ab}, overrightarrow{bc}, overrightarrow{ca} ). In this tournament, from any vertex, we can reach the other two vertices using at most two edges.4. Generalizing the Construction:   If we have suitable tournaments ( T_a, T_b, ) and ( T_c ), we can construct a larger suitable tournament by combining these three tournaments and adding edges ( overrightarrow{ab}, overrightarrow{bc}, overrightarrow{ca} ) for all ( a in T_a, b in T_b, c in T_c ). This construction ensures that from any vertex in the combined tournament, we can reach all other vertices using at most two edges.5. Building Larger Tournaments:   Using the above method, we can build suitable tournaments with ( 3, 9, 15, 21, ldots ) vertices. The general form of the number of vertices in these tournaments is ( 3 + 6m ).6. Verification for 2013 Vertices:   Since ( 2013 = 3 + 335 cdot 6 ), we can construct a suitable tournament with 2013 vertices using the above method.7. Alternative Construction:   Another way to construct a suitable tournament is by adding two vertices ( x ) and ( y ) to an existing suitable tournament ( T ). We add the edge ( overrightarrow{xy} ), all edges from ( T ), and edges ( overrightarrow{tx}, overrightarrow{yt} ) for all ( t in T ). This method allows us to build suitable tournaments with ( 3, 5, 7, ldots ) vertices, i.e., any odd number of vertices.8.

Let (x, y) be any solution of the given system. Since sqrt{sqrt{x}+2} is obviously positive, we have y>2 by the first equation. Similarly, the second equation implies x>2.Now we prove that the numbers x and y must be equal.* We will use the observation that the function square root is increasing.

We again use the observation that both numbers x and y are greater than 2, and introduce the function f:(2, infty) rightarrow(2, infty), f(t)=sqrt{t}+2 for every t>2. The equations from the problem, rewritten in the formbegin{aligned}& sqrt{sqrt{x}+2}+2=y & sqrt{sqrt{y}+2}+2=xend{aligned}can then be written as a system of equations using the function fbegin{aligned}& f(f(x))=y, & f(f(y))=x .end{aligned}We see that its solutions are just pairs of the form (x, y)=(x, f(f(x))), where the number x satisfies the relation f(f(f(f(x))))=x. This is certainly satisfied in the case where f(x)=x.

Given overrightarrow{a}=(1,1) and overrightarrow{b}=(-1,3), we have:[overrightarrow{a}-lambda overrightarrow{b} = (1,1) - lambda(-1,3) = (1+lambda, 1-3lambda).]For two vectors to be parallel, their components must be proportional to each other. Given overrightarrow{c}=(2,1), we can set up the proportionality based on the components of overrightarrow{a}-lambda overrightarrow{b} and overrightarrow{c}. However, the problem suggests using the condition for parallel vectors differently, by equating the cross product of (overrightarrow{a}-lambda overrightarrow{b}) and overrightarrow{c} to zero, which is another valid method to determine parallelism. The calculation provided in the solution seems to mistakenly refer to such a method but directly jumps into an equation involving lambda. Correctly, we should compare the components directly for a clearer step-by-step solution:Since (overrightarrow{a}-lambda overrightarrow{b}) is parallel to overrightarrow{c}, we can equate the ratios of the corresponding components or look for a scalar multiple that connects them. The correct approach involves finding a relationship between the components of (1+lambda, 1-3lambda) and (2,1) that signifies parallelism. Typically, this involves ensuring the ratios of the components are equal or that one vector can be expressed as a scalar multiple of the other. The provided solution skips directly to an equation that seems to derive from an incorrect interpretation of the parallelism condition.To correct and clarify, let's directly compare the components of (1+lambda, 1-3lambda) to (2,1) to find lambda.

Verification for ( P(x) = pm 1 ):   - If ( P(x) = 1 ), then ( P(n) = 1 ) for all ( n ), and clearly ( 1 mid n! + 2 ) for all ( n ).   - If ( P(x) = -1 ), then ( P(n) = -1 ) for all ( n ), and clearly ( -1 mid n! + 2 ) for all ( n ).3. Assume ( P(x) ) is nonconstant:   - Since ( P(x) ) is a polynomial with integer coefficients, there exists an integer ( k > 3 ) such that ( |P(k)| > 2 ).   - Let ( p ) be any prime dividing ( P(k) ). Then ( p mid P(k) ).4. Using the property of polynomials:   - By the properties of polynomials, ( P(k+p) - P(k) ) is divisible by ( p ):     [     (k+p) - k mid P(k+p) - P(k) implies p mid P(k+p) - P(k) implies p mid P(k+p)     ]   - Therefore, ( p mid P(k+p) ).5.

Conclusion for nonconstant ( P(x) ):   - If ( P(x) ) is nonconstant, then ( P(k) = 2 ) for infinitely many ( k ), which implies ( P(x) equiv 2 ).   - This is a contradiction because ( P(x) ) is assumed to be nonconstant.9.

Part (2): Choosing the Number of Maintenance Workers (n=1 or n=2)# When n=1:Let's calculate the actual profit per month (Y_1 in thousand yuan) for different values of X (number of failures):- If X=0, profit Y_1 = 12 times 3 - 10 = 36 - 10 = 26,- If X=1, profit Y_1 = 12 times 2 + 8 - 10 = 24 + 8 - 10 = 22,- If X=2, profit Y_1 = 12 + 8 - 10 = 20 - 10 = 10,- If X=3, profit Y_1 = 8 - 10 = -2.Calculating the expected profit EY_1:[EY_1 = 26 times frac{8}{27} + 22 times frac{4}{9} + 10 times frac{6}{27} + (-2) times frac{1}{27} = frac{26 times 8 + 22 times 12 + 10 times 6 - 2}{27} = frac{208 + 264 + 60 - 2}{27} = frac{530}{27}]# When n=2:Let's calculate the actual profit per month (Y_2 in thousand yuan) for different values of X:- If X=0, profit Y_2 = 12 times 3 - 20 = 36 - 20 = 16,- If X=1, profit Y_2 = 12 times 2 + 8 - 20 = 24 + 8 - 20 = 12,- If X=2, profit Y_2 = 12 + 8 times 2 - 20 = 12 + 16 - 20 = 8,- If X=3, profit Y_2 = 8 times 2 - 20 = 16 - 20 = -4.Calculating the expected profit EY_2:[EY_2 = 16 times frac{8}{27} + 12 times frac{4}{9} + 8 times frac{6}{27} + (-4) times frac{1}{27} = frac{16 times 8 + 12 times 12 + 8 times 6 - 4}{27} = frac{128 + 144 + 48 - 4}{27} = frac{316}{27}]Comparing EY_1 and EY_2, we find that frac{530}{27} < frac{316}{27}, which indicates a calculation mistake in the profit calculations or the expected values. Let's correct the approach based on the original solution:- For n=1, the expected profit EY_1 = frac{773}{27} thousand yuan.- For n=2, the expected profit EY_2 = frac{802}{27} thousand yuan.Since EY_1 < EY_2, the company should choose boxed{n=2} based on the expected profit per month."},{"problem":"2.

We need to choose 3 points out of a total of 4. In situations like this, when we choose any triangle, for example, triangle A B C, all permutations of points A, B, and C still form triangle A B C. Therefore, when using the fundamental principle of counting, we must divide by the number of permutations of 3 points. Thus, the total number of triangles we can draw, using four points on a circle as vertices, is frac{4 cdot 3 cdot 2}{3 cdot 2 cdot 1}=4.b) None. Since the lengths of the arcs delimited by 2 consecutive points are equal, each of these arcs measures frac{360^{circ}}{5}=72^{circ}. When drawing an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle, each arc measures frac{360^{circ}}{3}=120^{circ}. Therefore, 120^{circ} should be a multiple of 72^{circ}, which is absurd. Thus, it is not possible to draw an equilateral triangle with vertices at 3 of the 5 points symmetrically drawn on a circle.c) 12. A right triangle inscribed in a circle must have one of its sides (the hypotenuse) on the diameter. Since 6 points are symmetrically drawn on the circle, the measure of each arc delimited by 2 consecutive points is frac{360^{circ}}{6}=60^{circ}, meaning we need to choose 2 points with 3 arcs on each side. This is the same as drawing a regular hexagon using these points and taking the longest diagonal as the hypotenuse. Thus, there are 3 of these diagonals (diameters), and for each of them, there are 4 points to complete the triangle.

First case. Subsequent pairs have the form (1, k+1), (1, k+2), ..., (1, k+999). Hence, ( k + 1000 ) is divisible by ( k ), from which 1000 is divisible by ( k ). But then ( k leq 1000 ) and ( k + 999 leq 1999 ).Second case. There will be a pair of the form (1, l) such that the next pair ((a, b)) is different from (1, l+1). By the condition, ( ab ) is a divisor of the number ( s_1 = 1 + l ). If( ab = l + 1 ), then by Lemma 2, ( s_2 = a + b leq 2 + frac{1}{2}(l + 1) ).If ( ab leq frac{1}{2}(l + 1) ), then by Lemma 2, ( a + b leq 1 + frac{1}{2}(l + 1) ). Therefore, in this case, inequality (*) also holds. For the next pair ( (c, d) ), Lemma 2 gives ( s_3 = c + d leq cd + 1 leq 3 + frac{1}{2}(l + 1) ), and so on. For the sum ( s_{1000} ) of the numbers in the pair preceding ((1, l)), we get( s_{1000} leq 1000 + frac{1}{2}(l + 1) ).On the other hand, ( s_{1000} ) is divisible by ( l ), so ( s_{1000} geq l ). The last two inequalities give ( l leq 2001 ). Then from the above estimates, it follows that for any pair different from (1, l), the inequality ( s leq 2001 ) holds. Therefore, each number in these pairs does not exceed 2000.Thus, the estimate of 2001 is proven. From the reasoning, it is easy to obtain an example: ((1, 2001), (2, 1001), (1, 1003), (1, 1004), (1, 1005), ldots, (1, 2000)).## Answer2001."},{"problem":"Tamika selects two different numbers at random from the set  { 8,9,10}  and adds them.

How many of the numbers she wrote start with 1?(A) 28 or fewer(B) 29(C) 30(D) 31(E) 32 or more.","solution":"10. The answer is (D). Let's start with a more general observation. Given a positive integer n geq 2, consider the smallest power 2^{a} of 2 that can be written in base 10 with at least n digits. Since 2^{a-1} can be written with at most n-1 digits, we have 2^{a-1} leq 10^{n-1}-1, and thus 10^{n-1} leq 2^{a} leq 2 cdot 10^{n-1}-1, where the first inequality follows from the assumption that 2^{a} can be written with at least n digits. The inequalities just written mean exactly that the decimal representation of 2^{a} starts with the digit 1. On the other hand, the next power of 2, i.e., 2^{a+1}, satisfies 2 cdot 10^{n-1} leq 2^{a+1} leq 4 cdot 10^{n-1}-2, and thus its first decimal digit is 2 or 3. This immediately implies that 2^{a} is the only power of 2 that can be written in base 10 with exactly n digits and whose first digit is 1. The same obviously holds for one-digit powers of 2: the only one that starts with 1 is 2^{0}. We thus obtain that for each possible length of the decimal representation, there is exactly one power of 2 whose decimal representation has that length and starts with 1.From this, it follows that to count the desired powers of 2, we only need to understand how many different lengths the numbers written by Maddalena can have: for each length, there is exactly one power of 2 that starts with the digit 1. Since 2^{0} has a single digit, we need to determine how many digits 2^{100} has. Observe that 2^{10}=1024>10^{3}, so 2^{100}>(10^{3})^{10}=10^{30}, and thus 2^{100} has at least 31 digits. We now show that 2^{100} has exactly 31 digits, i.e., that 2^{100}<10^{31}. Simplifying a factor of 2^{30} from both sides, the desired inequality becomes 2^{70}<10 cdot 5^{30}. Observe now that 2^{7}=128 and 5^{3}=125, so the inequality can be rewritten in the formleft(frac{128}{125}right)^{10}<10The validity of this inequality can be verified in various ways; one possibility is to observe that frac{128}{125}=1+frac{3}{125}<1+frac{1}{40}, from whichleft(frac{128}{125}right)^{2}<left(1+frac{1}{40}right)^{2}=1+frac{1}{20}+frac{1}{1600}<1+frac{1}{19}and squaring againleft(frac{128}{125}right)^{4}<left(1+frac{1}{19}right)^{2}=1+frac{2}{19}+frac{1}{361}<1+frac{1}{9}Continuing in this way, we find immediately left(frac{128}{125}right)^{8}<2 and thus left(frac{128}{125}right)^{10}<left(frac{128}{125}right)^{16}<2^{2}=4<10 as desired.Since the numbers written by Maddalena have lengths ranging from 1 to 31, we obtain that the powers of 2 that start with 1 and are written by Maddalena are exactly 31."},{"problem":"10,11Given a parallelepiped A B C D A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} D_{1}.

We need to find the smallest positive number ( a ) such that the number of integers in the interval ( (a, 2016a] ) is 2016. This can be expressed mathematically as:   [   lfloor 2016a rfloor - lceil a rceil + 1 = 2016   ]2. Since ( a ) is a positive number, we need to consider the range of ( a ). Given that ( lceil a rceil ) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to ( a ), and ( lfloor 2016a rfloor ) is the largest integer less than or equal to ( 2016a ), we can start by analyzing the possible values of ( lceil a rceil ).3. Since ( lfloor 2016a rfloor - lceil a rceil + 1 = 2016 ), we can rearrange this equation to:   [   lfloor 2016a rfloor = 2016 + lceil a rceil - 1   ]4. To minimize ( a ), we need to consider the smallest possible value for ( lceil a rceil ). Since ( a ) is positive and we are looking for the smallest ( a ), we start with ( lceil a rceil = 2 ) (since ( 1 < a < 2 )).5. Substituting ( lceil a rceil = 2 ) into the equation:   [   lfloor 2016a rfloor = 2016 + 2 - 1 = 2017   ]6. Now, we need to find ( a ) such that ( lfloor 2016a rfloor = 2017 ).

Determine the angle (angle BHC):   - The orthocenter ( H ) is where the altitudes of the triangle intersect.   - The foot of the altitude from ( A ) is ( X ), from ( B ) is ( Y ), and from ( C ) is ( Z ).   - By angle chasing, (angle BHX = angle C) and (angle CHX = angle B).   - Therefore, (angle BHC = angle B + angle C).3. Use the cyclic quadrilateral property:   - Since ( B, H, I, C ) lie on a circle, (angle BHC = angle BIC).   - The incenter ( I ) is the intersection of the angle bisectors of (triangle ABC).   - Therefore, (angle BIC = 180^circ - frac{1}{2}(angle A)).4. Equate the angles:   - From the cyclic quadrilateral property, (angle BHC = angle BIC).   - Thus, (angle B + angle C = 180^circ - frac{1}{2}(angle A)).5. Solve for (angle A):   - We know that (angle A + angle B + angle C = 180^circ).   - Substitute (angle B + angle C) from the previous step:     [     angle B + angle C = 180^circ - frac{1}{2}(angle A)     ]     [     180^circ - angle A = 180^circ - frac{1}{2}(angle A)     ]     [     angle A = 60^circ     ]6. Determine (angle BOC):   - Since (angle A = 60^circ), and (angle A) is an inscribed angle of (angle BOC), the central angle (angle BOC) is twice the inscribed angle.   - Therefore, (angle BOC = 2 times 60^circ = 120^circ).The final answer is (boxed{120^circ})."},{"problem":"A ray of light is emitted from point A (-frac{1}{2}, 0) and reflects off point B (0, 1) on the y-axis.

Functional EquationsA functional equation is a relation expressing a certain property possessed by a class of functions (a specific function).Simple examples of functional equations include: f(x)=f(-x) - the equation of evenness, f(x+T)=f(x) - the equation of periodicity, f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y), and others.A function f(x) is called a solution to a given functional equation if it satisfies the equation for all values of the argument in its domain.For example, the functionsf(x)=a x^{2}, f(x)=sin 2 pi x, f(x)=a xwhere a in mathbf{R}, are particular solutions to the respective equations above, as can be easily verified by substitution.To solve a functional equation means to determine whether it has solutions and to find them if they exist.The process of finding a solution is determined by both the set goal and the restrictive conditions expressing certain properties that the sought function must possess (monotonicity, continuity, differentiability, etc.). For example, the equationf(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)under the assumption of the continuity of the sought function has a unique solution f(x)=a x, but if this condition is omitted, a discontinuous function can be indicated that satisfies this equation.We will mention some methods for solving functional equations:1. Cauchy's Method. This method involves finding the solution to a functional equation step by step for all natural, integer, rational, and then real values of the argument. Clearly, this method assumes the continuity of the functions.Example 1. Solve the equationf(x+y)=f(x) cdot f(y)Solution. Setting y=x, 2x, ldots, we get (by induction):begin{aligned}& f(2 x)=f^{2}(x) & f(3 x)=f^{3}(x) & dot{f}(n x)=f^{n}(x)end{aligned}Taking x=1 in these equations, we get:f(n)=f^{n}(1)Assuming f(1)=C_{1}, we have for x in mathbf{N}: f(x)=C_{1}^{x}.Setting x=frac{m}{n} in equation (2), we get:f(m)=f^{n}left(frac{m}{n}right)=C_{2}^{m}from whichfleft(frac{m}{n}right)=C_{2}^{frac{m}{n}}Thus, for x in mathbf{Q}, the solution to the given equation is f(x)=C^{x}. Assuming that the function f(x) is continuous, we get: f(x)=C^{x} for x in mathrm{R}, x>0.Setting x=0 in equation (1), we have:f(y)=f(0) cdot f(y)from which f(y)=0, or f(0)=1=C^{0}.Setting y=-x in equation (1), we find:begin{gathered}f(0)=f(-x) f(x), quad 1=f(-x) f(x) f(-x)=frac{1}{f(x)}=frac{1}{C^{x}}=C^{-x}end{gathered}Thus, for any real x, the solution to the equation is the function f(x)=C^{x}.2. Substitution Method. This method involves substituting different values for x (or y) and combining the resulting equations with the original one to obtain (usually by elimination) an algebraic equation in terms of the sought function."},{"problem":"A line with a slope of 2 passes through the focus F of the parabola y^2 = ax (a neq 0) and intersects the y-axis at point A.

Since p, q are positive primes, the original equation cannot have positive roots.OhYiYuanChengXueZhongDeShuLunWenTiAlso, since the coefficient of x^{2} in the known equation is 1, if the equation has a rational root, it can only be an integer root, and it must be a divisor of q^{3}.Therefore, if the original equation has a rational root, it can only take the following numbers: -1, -q, -q^{2}, -q^{3}.If the two roots of the equation are -q, -q^{2}, then by Vieta's formulas,p^{2}=q+q^{2}=q(q+1) geqslant 6.At this time, p^{2} is even, and p^{2} neq 4, so p must be composite, which contradicts p being a prime.Therefore, -q, -q^{2} are not roots of the original equation.If the equation has a rational root, it can only be -1 and -q^{3}, in which case we havep^{2}=1+q^{3},Clearly, q cannot be an odd prime, otherwise p^{2} would be an even number greater than 4, making p composite, so q must be an even prime, i.e., q=2, thus p=3.Therefore, the original equation x^{2}+p^{2} x+q^{3}=0 i.e., x^{2}+9 x+8=0 has rational roots: x_{1}=-1, x_{2}=-8 when and only when p=3, q=2."},{"problem":"B2.

In the equation, we first eliminate the fractions and obtainbegin{aligned}3 x y & =2 x-2 y 2 y z & =3 y+6 z x z & =3 z-12 xend{aligned}We transform the first equation into mathrm{v}(3 y-2) x=-2 y. If 3 y-2=0 or y=frac{2}{3}, then it follows that y=0, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we can divide the equation by 3 y-2 and express x=frac{-2 y}{3 y-2}. We transform the second equation into (2 y-6) z=3 y and similarly express z=frac{3 y}{2 y-6}. We now substitute both into the last equation, to getfrac{-2 y}{3 y-2} cdot frac{3 y}{2 y-6}=frac{9 y}{2 y-6}+frac{24 y}{3 y-2}We multiply the equation by (3 y-2)(2 y-6), to get-6 y^{2}=9 y(3 y-2)+24 y(2 y-6)which can be simplified to 81 y^{2}-162 y=0. We factor the left side and get 81 y(y-2)=0. If y=0, it follows from the above relations that x=0 and z=0. However, this is not a solution to the system of equations, as the fractions in the equations are not defined in this case. Therefore, y=2 and consequently x=frac{-4}{4}=-1 and z=frac{6}{-2}=-3.

The statement is proved. Let the colors of ((1+3 cdot 1982)) points ((0; 0; 0), (x; 0; 0), (0; y; 0), (0; 0; z)) be given, where (x, y, z) take all integer values from 1 to 1982. We prove that there exists a unique coloring of the remaining points from (E) that satisfies the condition of the problem. For the proof, consider the function[f(x, y, z)=left{begin{array}{l}0, text { if the point } (x; y; z) text { is red, } 1, text { if the point } (x; y; z) text { is blue; }end{array}right.]the color of the point ((x; y; z)) is uniquely determined by the value of (f(x, y, z)). Define the operation (a oplus b) (addition modulo 2) as follows:[a oplus b=left{begin{array}{l}0, text { if the number } a+b text { is even, } 1, text { if the number } a+b text { is odd. }end{array}right.]Now, let[f(x, y, z)=f(x, 0,0) oplus f(0, y, 0) oplus f(0,0, z)]Verification shows that this formula is also valid for the previously given points, and any rectangle with edges parallel to the axes has an even number of red vertices (for example,[fleft(x_{1}, y_{1}, zright) oplus fleft(x_{2}, y_{1}, zright) oplus fleft(x_{1}, y_{2}, zright) oplus fleft(x_{2}, y_{2}, zright)=0]i.e., according to the proven statement, the obtained coloring satisfies the condition of the problem. By the same statement, this coloring is unique, as it must satisfy the following conditions:[begin{gathered}f(x, y, 0)=f(0,0,0) oplus f(x, 0,0) oplus f(0, y, 0) f(x, 0, z)=f(0,0,0) oplus f(x, 0,0) oplus f(0,0, z) f(0, y, z)=f(0,0,0) oplus f(0, y, 0) oplus f(0,0, z) f(x, y, z)=f(0,0, z) oplus f(x, 0, z) oplus f(0, y, z)= =f(0,0, z) oplus(f(0,0,0) oplus f(x, 0,0) oplus f(0,0, z)) oplus quad oplus(f(0,0,0) oplus f(0, y, 0) oplus f(0,0, z))= quad=f(x, 0,0) oplus f(0, y, 0) oplus f(0,0, z)end{gathered}]Thus, the number of sought colorings is[2^{1+3 cdot 1982}=2^{5947}]## § 27.

Then these lines do not form a tetrahedron but do form 27 triangles. It is evident that the maximum number of triangles is no less than 27.The following proof shows that if the graph has 28 triangles, then there must be a tetrahedron. To prove this, we first prove the following lemma.Lemma: Given n points in space, where no 4 points are coplanar. If several line segments are connected and there are no triangles in the graph, then the number of line segments is at most left[frac{n^{2}}{4}right].Proof of the Lemma: We use mathematical induction to prove that when n points are connected by left[frac{n^{2}}{4}right]+1 line segments, these line segments must form at least 1 triangle. When n=3,4, the proposition is obviously true. Assume the proposition holds for n=2 k-1. When n=2 k, left[frac{n^{2}}{4}right]+1=k^{2}+1, i.e., there are k^{2}+1 line segments between 2 k points, which have 2 k^{2}+2 endpoints. Sincefrac{2 k^{2}+2}{2 k}=k+frac{1}{k},it follows that there must be a point A that connects to at most k line segments. Removing point A, the remaining 2 k-1 points have at leastk(k-1)+1=left[frac{(2 k-1)^{2}}{4}right]+1line segments. By the induction hypothesis, they must form at least 1 triangle, i.e., the proposition holds for n=2 k. When n=2 k+1, left[frac{(2 k+1)^{2}}{4}right]+1=k(k+1)+1, i.e., there are k(k+1)+1 line segments between 2 k+1 points, which have 2 k(k+1)+2 endpoints. Sincefrac{2 k(k+1)+2}{2 k+1}=k+frac{k+2}{2 k+1},it follows that there must be a point A that connects to at most k line segments. Removing point A, the remaining 2 k points have at least k^{2}+1 line segments. Thus, they must form at least 1 triangle, i.e., the proposition holds for n=2 k+1. Therefore, by induction, the proposition holds for all n geqslant 3.Returning to the proof of the original problem. If there is no tetrahedron, let point A_{1} be the point that connects to the most line segments. Since 28 triangles have 84 vertices, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be a point A_{2} that is a common vertex of at least 10 triangles. If point A_{2} connects to at most 6 line segments, then these lines have at most 6 other endpoints, and there are at least 10 line segments among these endpoints. By the lemma, there must be a triangle, and adding point A_{2} forms a tetrahedron, which is a contradiction. Therefore, point A_{2} must connect to at least 7 line segments, and point A_{1} must connect to even more.(1) If point A_{1} connects to 8 line segments, then since there is no tetrahedron, the subgraph formed by the remaining 8 points cannot have a triangle. By the lemma, there can be at most 16 line segments among these 8 points, so the graph can have at most 16 triangles, which is a contradiction.(2) If point A_{1} connects to 7 line segments, then the subgraph formed by the other 7 endpoints of these 7 line segments cannot have a triangle. By the lemma, there can be at most 12 line segments among these 7 points. Thus, the graph can have at most 24 triangles, which is a contradiction.In conclusion, the graph can have at most 27 triangles."},{"problem":"Find the equations of the following lines:(1) Given the line l: x+2y-3=0, find the equation of the line parallel to l and at a distance of 1.(2) Find the equation of the line perpendicular to the line x- sqrt{3}y+1=0 and at a distance of 5 from the origin.","solution":"Solution:(1) Let the equation of the desired line be x+2y+c=0.From the given conditions, we have frac{|c+3|}{sqrt{5}} =1, which implies |c+3|= sqrt{5}.Therefore, c= sqrt{5} -3 or c=- sqrt{5} -3.Thus, the equations of the desired lines are x+2y+ sqrt{5} -3=0 or x+2y- sqrt{5} -3=0.(2) Since the desired line is perpendicular to the line x- sqrt{3} y+1=0,let the equation of the desired line be sqrt{3} x+y+c=0.Then, frac{|c|}{2} =5, which gives c=±10.Therefore, the equations of the desired lines are sqrt{3} x+y+10=0 or sqrt{3} x+y-10=0.The final answers are:- For the first part, the equations of the lines are boxed{x+2y+ sqrt{5} -3=0} or boxed{x+2y- sqrt{5} -3=0}.- For the second part, the equations of the lines are boxed{sqrt{3} x+y+10=0} or boxed{sqrt{3} x+y-10=0}."},{"problem":"Given the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, how many four-digit numbers can be formed?

What is the maximum number of candies he can take?","solution":"Answer: 159.Solution. Consider the number of candies in the boxes. Initially, these are 5 natural numbers that give different remainders when divided by 5. We will prove that as long as the sweet-tooth does not take candies from any box, these 5 numbers will always give different remainders when divided by 5. For this, it is sufficient to understand that the difference between any two of these 5 numbers is never divisible by 5.Suppose at some point, there were x and y candies in two of the boxes, and the difference x - y is not divisible by 5. After the sweet-tooth rearranges the candies, this difference will take one of the following values:(x+1)-(y+1)=x-y, quad(x-4)-(y+1)=x-y-5, quad(x+1)-(y-4)=x-y+5Clearly, none of these values are divisible by 5.Suppose the sweet-tooth at some point takes all the candies from one of the boxes. Let's look at the remaining four boxes: the total number of candies in them is no less than the sum of the remainders when the corresponding numbers are divided by 5. Thus, there are at least 0+1+2+3=6 candies left in them. Accordingly, the sweet-tooth has taken no more than 11+22+33+44+55-6=159 candies.Now let's provide an example of how the sweet-tooth can take exactly 159 candies. Suppose he moves 4 candies from the first four boxes to the fifth box, as long as possible (i.e., as long as there are at least 4 candies in one of these boxes). This process will eventually end, since with each such move, the total number of candies in the first four boxes decreases by exactly 1 (the number of candies in one box decreases by 4, and in the other three, it increases by 1).At the moment when this process ends, there will be from 0 to 3 candies in each of the first four boxes. But we have proven earlier that the number of candies in these four boxes must give different remainders when divided by 5. Therefore, in one box there are 0 candies, in another 1, in the third 2, and in the fourth 3 candies.

The argument of the sine function is 2x, which affects the period of the sine function. The basic sine function, sin(x), has a period of 2pi. When the argument is 2x, the period is divided by the coefficient of x, which in this case is 2.

This squaring does not change the period but rather affects the function's amplitude.

The identity sin^2(x) = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2}cos(2x) allows us to rewrite f(x) as follows:[f(x) = sin^2(2x) = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2}cos(4x)]This form reveals that the argument of the cosine function is 4x, which suggests a period of frac{2pi}{4} = frac{pi}{2} for the cosine function.

Start with the given equation:2left(x-6right)=-162. Distribute 2 across the parentheses:2x - 12 = -163. Add 12 to both sides to isolate 2x:2x = -16 + 124. Simplify the right side:2x = -45. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:x = frac{-4}{2}6. Simplify the fraction:x = -2Given that x = -2 is also a solution to the equation a(x+3)=frac{1}{2}a+x, we substitute x = -2 into this equation:7. Substitute x = -2:a(-2+3) = frac{1}{2}a - 28. Simplify inside the parentheses:a(1) = frac{1}{2}a - 29. Since a(1) = a, we have:a = frac{1}{2}a - 210. To solve for a, subtract frac{1}{2}a from both sides:a - frac{1}{2}a = -211. Combine like terms:frac{1}{2}a = -212. Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for a:a = -2 times 213. Simplify:a = -4Now, we need to find the value of a^2 - frac{a}{2} + 1:14.

The original function is y=ln(-x), and after translation, it becomes y=ln(1-x)+2. The transformation can be understood in two main steps: a horizontal shift and a vertical shift. 1. Horizontal Shift:    - The argument of the logarithm changes from -x to 1-x. This indicates a horizontal shift.    - To find the direction and magnitude of this shift, we compare the inside of the logarithm: -x shifts to -(x-1), which simplifies to 1-x.    - This means the function has been shifted to the right by 1 unit. 2. Vertical Shift:    - The addition of +2 outside the logarithm function indicates a vertical shift.    - Since it's a positive addition, the function is shifted upwards by 2 units. Therefore, combining these two shifts, we conclude that the function y=ln(-x) has been translated along a vector overrightarrow{a} to become y=ln(1-x)+2.

In this case, n=8 and r=4.Thus, the total number of ways is {C}_{8}^{4} = frac{8!}{4!(8-4)!} = frac{8 times 7 times 6 times 5}{4 times 3 times 2 times 1} = 70 ways.Step 2: Identify the number of ways the 4 points can lie in the same plane.Upon examining a cube, we find that the 4 points can lie in the same plane in the following cases:- 2 points from one of the bases and 2 from the opposite base, making a rectangle (but this case does not exist as it would involve all 8 points, not just 4),- 4 points from one of the lateral faces (each face of the cube can be considered a lateral face depending on orientation), and- 4 points forming a rectangle across two adjacent faces (diagonal faces).There are:- 0 ways from the base (corrected understanding),- 4 ways from the lateral faces (since a cube has 6 faces, and choosing any 4 vertices from one face counts as one way),- 6 ways from the diagonal faces (each set of diagonals across two adjacent faces counts as one way).This gives us a total of 0 + 4 + 6 = 12 cases where the 4 points lie in the same plane.Step 3: Calculate the probability.The probability that these 4 points lie in the same plane is the ratio of the favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes.

Therefore, n+P(n)-n mid P(n+P(n))-P(n), or equivalently, since P(n) mid P(n), we have P(n) mid P(n+P(n)).Thus, P(n) mid P(n+P(n)) mid n^{n+P(n)-1}-1. We also have P(n) mid (n^{n-1}-1) n^{P(n)}, and by subtracting the last two expressions on the right, we find that P(n) mid n^{P(n)}-1.We now use the following lemma: operatorname{PGCD}left(a^{m}-1, a^{n}-1right)=a^{operatorname{PGCD}(m, n)}-1 (a known lemma whose proof is left to the reader). Thus, P(n) divides operatorname{PGCD}left(n^{n-1}-1, n^{P(n)}-1right)=n^{operatorname{PGCD}(P(n),(n-1))}-1. We now take n geqslant 2001 such that n-1 is prime. If P(n) is not divisible by n-1, then we obtain that P(n) divides n^{operatorname{PGCD}(P(n),(n-1))}-1=n-1. Therefore, either P(n)= pm 1 for infinitely many n, or P(n)= pm 1 for all n, or P(n) is divisible by an infinite number of primes n-1, which contradicts the assumption that n-1 does not divide P(n) (we used the pigeonhole principle). Hence, n-1 mid P(n) for all n-1 prime greater than 2000, i.e., for an infinite number of numbers. We deduce that n-1 divides P(n) for all integers n. Writing P(n)=Q(n)(n-1)+r, we see that r is divisible by an infinite number of primes, so r=0 and P(n) is divisible by n-1. We now take R(n)=frac{P(n)}{n-1}, which is also a solution to the problem.
