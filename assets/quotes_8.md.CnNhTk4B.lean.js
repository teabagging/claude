The roots are x = -1 and x = 2.2. The inequality (x+1)(x-2) < 0 means the product of the two expressions is negative; this occurs when x is between the roots, excluding the roots themselves since the inequality is strict (< 0 and not ≤ 0).3.

Seventeen people dine every Saturday evening around a round table.How many times is it possible to dine if everyone wants to have two new neighbors each time?What is the result for eighteen people?Note: This exercise is the same as Exercise 1 (middle school students had to solve 1, high school students 5), but in a less specific case. The proposed solution below is very general, but difficult for an average high school student to access. This exercise was therefore intended to identify students who are best able to tackle formidable Olympic problems.","solution":"Solution: The first thing to notice is the following. Let n be the number of guests (17 or 18), and k be the number of dinners; we are interested in a particular guest among the n. Knowing that he has two neighbors at each dinner, and that he must never meet the same person more than once, he will therefore meet 2 k different people in total. Since there are only n-1 people he can meet, we have 2 k leq n-1, which means - in both cases - that there are at most 8 possible dinners.Now let's show that there indeed exist 8 arrangements such that two people are never neighbors more than once. We number the guests and the seats from 0 to n-1 (since the table is round, the (n-1)-th seat is therefore next to the 0-th), and the arrangements from 1 to 8.For n=17, we can proceed as follows: at the i-th dinner, we place the j-th person at the i j-th seat modulo 17. (The complete scheme of arrangements is presented a bit further down. In a less abstract, but longer and vaguer way, we can say thaton the first Saturday, we place all guests in order; on the second Saturday, we place one out of two; on the third, one out of three; and so on; knowing that when the numbers exceed 17, we \\"return to 0\\".) We need to verify two things.First, let's verify that this is a valid arrangement. Each guest receives one and only one seat, because between 0 and 16, there is one and only one number congruent to a given residue modulo 17. No seat is occupied by two guests: indeed, let j and j^{prime} be two guests who occupy the same seat at the i-th dinner. Then we have i j equiv i j^{prime}(bmod 17), or 17 mid i j-i j^{prime}, or 17 mid ileft(j-j^{prime}right). Since 17 is prime and 0<i<17, i is coprime with 17, so 17 mid j-j^{prime}. Therefore, j equiv j^{prime}(bmod 17), which means j=j^{prime}. And since there are as many seats as guests, all seats are necessarily occupied.Now let's verify that this is indeed a solution to the problem. Since the difference between the numbers of two adjacent seats is congruent to pm 1 modulo 17, this means that at the i-th dinner, the difference between the numbers of two adjacent people is congruent to pm i modulo 17. The numbers pm 1, pm 2, ldots, pm 8 are all different modulo 17: two given people can therefore be neighbors only once.We could also have explicitly presented the scheme of arrangements:| Place quad 012345678910111213141516 || :--- || 1st dinner 012345678910111213141516 || 2nd dinner 024681012141613579111315 || 3rd dinner 036912151471013162581114 || 4th dinner 048121637111526101415913 || 5th dinner 051015381316111649142712 || 6th dinner 061217132814391541016511 || 7th dinner 071441118155122916613310 || 8th dinner 081671561451341231121019 |and verify that each guest appears once and only once in each row and has different neighbors in each row. But such a solution, although less abstract, would be much more laborious (366 checks to make in total!), and has the drawback of being \\"parachuted\\": one can see that it works, but one does not understand very well why it works.For n=18, a possible solution is to start from the previous arrangement and to intercalate the new person each time. Since we already know that the first 17 people are well placed as required, it is enough to ensure that the last person (who, in this case, bears the number 17: this is not an error, as we numbered from 0) has different neighbors each time. We can, for example, place her between 3 and 4 at the first dinner, between 11 and 13 at the second, then between 2 and 5, between 10 and 14, between 1 and 6, between 9 and 15, between 0 and 7, and finally between 8 and 16 at the eighth dinner: each number between 0 and 16 appears at most once in this list. The complete arrangement is therefore as follows:\`\`\`Place (quad 01234567891011121314151617)    1st dinner 01231745678910111213141516    2nd dinner 02468101214161357911171315    3rd dinner 03691215147101316217581114    4th dinner 04812163711152610171415913    5th dinner 05101538131176111649142712    6th dinner 06121713281439171541016511    7th dinner 01771441118155122916613310    8th dinner 08171671561451341231121019 .\`\`\`"},{"problem":"2.3.

Separate the first term of ( B ) from the product:   [   B = left(1 + frac{1}{1 cdot 2}right) prod_{i=2}^{infty} frac{i^2 + i + 1}{i(i+1)} = frac{3}{2} prod_{i=2}^{infty} frac{i^2 + i + 1}{i(i+1)}   ]6.

Therefore, it is sufficient to distribute the prime numbers of the factorization of 2030 between the two factors x+5 and y+5, in all possible ways.Since x must be positive, then x+5 must be at least 6, as must y+5. In particular, both factors must be positive. Furthermore, the equation is symmetric in x and y, so we can assume that the only factor 2 divides x+5.

Initially, these are 5 natural numbers that give different remainders when divided by 5. We will prove that as long as the sweet-tooth does not take candies from any box, these 5 numbers will always give different remainders when divided by 5. For this, it is sufficient to understand that the difference between any two of these 5 numbers is never divisible by 5.Suppose at some point, there were x and y candies in two of the boxes, and the difference x - y is not divisible by 5. After the sweet-tooth rearranges the candies, this difference will take one of the following values:(x+1)-(y+1)=x-y, quad(x-4)-(y+1)=x-y-5, quad(x+1)-(y-4)=x-y+5Clearly, none of these values are divisible by 5.Suppose the sweet-tooth at some point takes all the candies from one of the boxes. Let's look at the remaining four boxes: the total number of candies in them is no less than the sum of the remainders when the corresponding numbers are divided by 5. Thus, there are at least 0+1+2+3=6 candies left in them. Accordingly, the sweet-tooth has taken no more than 11+22+33+44+55-6=159 candies.Now let's provide an example of how the sweet-tooth can take exactly 159 candies. Suppose he moves 4 candies from the first four boxes to the fifth box, as long as possible (i.e., as long as there are at least 4 candies in one of these boxes). This process will eventually end, since with each such move, the total number of candies in the first four boxes decreases by exactly 1 (the number of candies in one box decreases by 4, and in the other three, it increases by 1).At the moment when this process ends, there will be from 0 to 3 candies in each of the first four boxes. But we have proven earlier that the number of candies in these four boxes must give different remainders when divided by 5. Therefore, in one box there are 0 candies, in another 1, in the third 2, and in the fourth 3 candies. This means that the remaining 159 candies are in the fifth box, which the sweet-tooth will take."},{"problem":"If frac{sin alpha + cos alpha}{sin alpha - cos alpha} = frac{1}{2}, find the value of tan 2alpha.","solution":"Analysis: The given equation's left side has its numerator and denominator simultaneously divided by cos alpha, utilizing the basic relationships between trigonometric functions to transform the equation into one involving tan alpha.

What is written on the board?","solution":"Answer: 2021.Solution. Let a and b be the prime divisors of x, with b=a+4. The pairs of the last digits of a and b can be (3,7),(7,1),(9,3). Since x cannot end in 7, only the first case is possible. Then the number y=frac{a+b}{2} ends in 5 and, therefore, has the form y=10 m+5. From this,y^{2} bmod 100=25left(4 m^{2}+4 m+1right) bmod 100=25which means y^{2} ends in 25. Therefore, x=y^{2}-4 ends in 21, and 21 is the last number written by Petya. Thus, x can take one of the following values:2021,192021,18192021, ldots, 1011 ldots 2021The first one fits, since 2021=43 cdot 47.

According to the first condition, we discard numbers starting with 10,12,13,15,16,18,19, and according to the second condition, the number starting with 11 (the sums of its digits at even and odd positions differ by 33).

Iterative Inequality:   [   |u_{n+1} - 5| < frac{1}{5} |u_n - 5| < left( frac{1}{5} right)^n |u_1 - 5|   ]   Since ( |u_1 - 5| = 1 ),   [   lim_{n to infty} |u_n - 5| = 0 implies lim_{n to infty} u_n = 5   ] Part (b)Given ( a ge 0 ), we need to prove that there exists a finite limit of ( (u_n) ).1. Initial Condition and Recurrence Relation:   [   u_1 = 6, quad u_{n+1} = frac{2n + a}{n} + sqrt{frac{n + a}{n}u_n + 4}   ]2. Defining a New Sequence:   Let ( v_n = frac{u_n}{n} ). Then,   [   v_1 = 6, quad v_{n+1} = frac{frac{2n + a}{n} + sqrt{(n + a)v_n + 4}}{n + 1}   ]3. Simplifying the Recurrence Relation:   [   v_{n+1} < frac{2n + a}{n^2 + n} + frac{sqrt{(n + a)v_n}}{n + 1} + frac{2}{n + 1}   ]   Using the inequality ( sqrt{a + b} < sqrt{a} + sqrt{b} ),   [   v_{n+1} le frac{2n + a}{n^2 + n} + frac{2}{n + 1} + frac{1}{2} left( frac{1}{n + 1} + frac{(n + a)v_n}{n + 1} right)   ]4. Applying the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM):   [   v_{n+1} le frac{2n + a}{n^2 + n} + frac{5}{2(n + 1)} + frac{1}{2} cdot frac{n + a}{n + 1} v_n   ]5. Bounding the Terms:   Since ( lim_{n to infty} frac{n + a}{n + 1} = 1 ), there exists ( N ) such that for all ( n ge N ),   [   frac{n + a}{n + 1} < frac{3}{2}   ]   Therefore, for ( n ge N ),   [   v_{n+1} < left( frac{2n + a}{n^2 + n} + frac{5}{2(n + 1)} right) + frac{3}{4} v_n   ]6. Applying the Lemma:   By the well-known lemma, if ( z_n ) is a positive sequence and ( z_{n+1} le cz_n + q_n ) with ( lim q_n = 0 ) and ( c in (0, 1) ), then ( lim z_n = 0 ). Here, ( v_n ) satisfies this condition, so   [   lim_{n to infty} frac{u_n}{n} = 0   ]7. Analyzing the Difference Again:   [   |u_{n+1} - 5| = left| frac{u_n - 5 + frac{au_n}{n}}{sqrt{frac{n + a}{n} u_n + 4} + 3} + frac{a}{n} right| < frac{1}{5} |u_n - 5| + left( frac{a}{5} cdot frac{u_n}{n} + frac{a}{n} right)   ]8. Applying the Lemma Again:   Since ( lim_{n to infty} frac{u_n}{n} = 0 ) and ( frac{a}{n} to 0 ), applying the lemma, we have   [   lim_{n to infty} |u_n - 5| = 0 implies lim_{n to infty} u_n = 5   ]The final answer is ( boxed{ 5 } )"},{"problem":"Given a parabola y^2 = 2x and a point A(x_0, y_0) on the parabola where x_0 > 2, two tangents are drawn from point A to the circle (x-1)^2 + y^2 = 1, intersecting the y-axis at points B and C.

If d were odd, then every second term of the sequence would be even, and the terms could not be prime numbers. (We are, of course, considering only integers as terms.) Therefore, d must be divisible by 2. If d were not divisible by 3, then among any three consecutive terms of the sequence, one would always be divisible by 3, so d must also be divisible by 3. Similarly, it can be shown that d is divisible by 5 and 7, so d is divisible by 2 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdot 7 = 210.In order to work with as small (positive) numbers as possible, we look for a sequence with a difference of d = 210. We will examine the primes that can be the starting term a of the sequence in increasing order until we find one for which all terms (a + 210i) for (0 leq i leq 9) are prime. It is clear that a geq 11.We expect to find a solution where every term is less than 2500, so it is sufficient to ensure that the subsequent terms (1 leq i leq 9) are not divisible by any prime less than sqrt{2500} = 50. The starting term itself can only be divisible by such a prime if it is equal to it.We can work with smaller numbers if, for successive values of p, we consider the remainder m of the division (a : p) instead of a and the remainder r of the division (210 : p) instead of d, i.e., a = alpha p + m, 210 = delta p + r, where alpha, delta are natural numbers, 0 leq m < p and 0 < r < p. Thus, we consider the following 10 numbers:m, m + r, m + 2r, ldots, m + 9rsince m + ri = (a + 210i) - (alpha + delta i) cdot p is divisible by p if and only if (a + 210i) is divisible by it.For each of the above p values, we collect in a table those values of m for which (1) none of the terms is divisible by p.

The further search is significantly simplified by taking as a basis that a gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 11. The first such prime number is 23, but it also gives a prohibited remainder for p = 13. Similarly, a = 67, 89 give prohibited remainders for p = 17, 13, and 45, 111, 133, 155, and 177 are not prime.

It is obvious that the number we are looking for is odd. The number 3 does not satisfy the condition because 3+6=9- is not a prime number. The number 5 satisfies the condition because 5+2=7, 5+6=11, 5+8=13, 5+12=17, 5+14=19, which means the ages of all the children are indeed prime numbers.Let's prove that this answer is unique. For this, consider the remainders when the numbers added to the age of the youngest child are divided by 5: the remainder of 2 is 2, the remainder of 6 is 1, the remainder of 8 is 3, the remainder of 12 is 2, and the remainder of 14 is 4. Thus, all remainders from 1 to 4 are present.

This still seemed too little to her. In the end, she prepared a total of 52 sandwiches. Each guest could then take four sandwiches, but five would not be enough for everyone. How many guests was Mrs. Siroka expecting? She herself is on a diet and never eats in the evening.","solution":"First, let's work with the part of the problem where 25 sandwiches are considered. According to this, Mrs. Siroka expected no more than 12 guests, because 25: 2=12, remainder 1, which means that 12 people could take two sandwiches each, but only one would be left. Here we also find out that Mrs. Siroka expected more than 8 guests, because 25: 3=8, remainder 1, which means that with 8 guests, everyone could take three sandwiches. So far, it is plausible that she expected 9, 10, 11, or 12 guests.Now let's consider only the part of the problem that talks about 35 sandwiches. We determine that Mrs. Siroka expected at most 11 guests, since 35: 3=11, remainder 2, and more than 8 guests, since 35: 4=8, remainder 3. Therefore, Mrs. Siroka could have expected 9, 10, or 11 guests.Next, let's work only with the consideration of 52 sandwiches. According to this, Mrs. Siroka expected at most 13 guests, because 52: 4=13, and more than 10 guests, because 52: 5=10, remainder 2. She therefore expected 11, 12, or 13 guests.We see that the only number of guests that fits all the data in the problem is 11.Another solution. Just as in the first paragraph of the previous solution, we determine that Mrs. Siroka could have expected 9, 10, 11, or 12 guests. For each number, we will check whether it corresponds to the other data in the problem.9 guests: With 35 sandwiches, everyone could take three sandwiches, not four, because 9 cdot 3 < 35. With 52 sandwiches, everyone could take four sandwiches, but even five, because 9 cdot 4 < 52. With 52 sandwiches, everyone could take four sandwiches, but even five, because 10 cdot 4 < 52.

The possible values of X can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, since there are 4 plain zongzi in total. Next, we calculate the probability of each possible value of X:- For X=0, no plain zongzi is taken. The probability of this happening is calculated by choosing 3 zongzi from the 6 that are not plain (red bean and meat) out of the total 10 zongzi. This gives us P(X=0) = frac{C_6^3}{C_{10}^3} = frac{20}{120} = frac{1}{6}.- For X=1, one plain zongzi is taken. The probability of this happening is calculated by choosing 2 zongzi from the 6 that are not plain and 1 from the 4 plain zongzi out of the total 10 zongzi. This gives us P(X=1) = frac{C_6^2C_4^1}{C_{10}^3} = frac{60}{120} = frac{1}{2}.- For X=2, two plain zongzi are taken. The probability of this happening is calculated by choosing 1 zongzi from the 6 that are not plain and 2 from the 4 plain zongzi out of the total 10 zongzi.

How many such six-digit numbers are there? (Answer with a number.)","solution":"To solve this problem, we consider the placement of 5 and 6 relative to 3. Since 5 and 6 must be on the same side of 3, there are two scenarios:1. 5 and 6 are both to the left of 3: In this case, we treat 5, 6, and 3 as a single unit. There are 3! ways to arrange 5, 6, and 3 within this unit. The remaining three digits (1, 2, 4) can be placed in the remaining three positions in 3! ways. Since the unit can be placed in any of the four positions in the six-digit number, there are 4 choices for its placement. Therefore, the total number of six-digit numbers in this scenario is 3! times 3! times 4 = 6 times 6 times 4 = 144.2. 5 and 6 are both to the right of 3: This scenario is symmetric to the first one. Therefore, it also produces 144 six-digit numbers.Adding the numbers from both scenarios, we get the total number of six-digit numbers as 144 + 144 = 288.However, the correct approach to solving this problem involves considering all possible arrangements of the six digits and then subtracting the cases where 5 and 6 are on different sides of 3. There are 6! ways to arrange the six digits without any restrictions. To find the number of arrangements where 5 and 6 are on different sides of 3, we consider placing 3 first, which can be done in 6 ways. Then, we place 5 and 6 on opposite sides of 3, which can be done in 2 times 5 times 4 = 40 ways (choosing sides for 5 and 6, and then arranging the remaining digits). Therefore, the total number of arrangements where 5 and 6 are on different sides of 3 is 6 times 40 = 240. Subtracting this from the total number of unrestricted arrangements gives 6! - 240 = 720 - 240 = 480.Therefore, the total number of six-digit numbers where both 5 and 6 are on the same side of 3 is boxed{480}."},{"problem":"p parallel lines are drawn in the plane and q lines perpendicular to them are also drawn.

Now, we need to check if ( n = 10 ) satisfies the condition:   - For ( p = 3 ), ( n - p = 10 - 3 = 7 ), which is prime.   - For ( p = 5 ), ( n - p = 10 - 5 = 5 ), which is prime.   - For ( p = 7 ), ( n - p = 10 - 7 = 3 ), which is prime.9. Therefore, ( n = 10 ) satisfies the condition that for each prime ( p ) with ( 2 < p < n ), the difference ( n - p ) is also prime.The final answer is ( boxed{10} )."},{"problem":"Given a quadratic equation x^{2}-4x-2=0 with two real roots x_{1} and x_{2}, the value of x_{1}x_{2} is ____.","solution":"Given the quadratic equation x^{2}-4x-2=0, we aim to find the product of its roots, x_{1}x_{2}.From the quadratic formula, we know that for any quadratic equation of the form ax^{2}+bx+c=0, the product of its roots x_{1} and x_{2} is given by frac{c}{a}.Applying this to our equation, we have:- a = 1 (the coefficient of x^{2}),- b = -4 (the coefficient of x),- c = -2 (the constant term).Thus, the product of the roots is:[x_{1}x_{2} = frac{c}{a} = frac{-2}{1} = -2]Therefore, the value of x_{1}x_{2} is boxed{-2}."},{"problem":"In the expansion of the binomial ({left( sqrt{x}+frac{3}{x} right)}^{n}), the sum of the coefficients of all terms is (A), the sum of the binomial coefficients is (B), and (A+B=72).

Prove that every positive integer ( N ) has a finite depth:   We need to show that repeatedly applying the sum of digits function ( S(cdot) ) to any positive integer ( N ) will eventually result in a one-digit number.   - Consider a positive integer ( N ) with ( k ) digits. The maximum sum of the digits of ( N ) is ( 9k ) (since each digit can be at most 9).   - If ( N ) has ( k ) digits, then ( N geq 10^{k-1} ). Therefore, ( S(N) leq 9k ).   - For ( k geq 2 ), ( 9k < 10^{k-1} ), which implies ( S(N) < N ).   Since ( S(N) < N ) for all ( N ) with two or more digits, the sequence ( N, S(N), S(S(N)), ldots ) is strictly decreasing until it reaches a one-digit number. Therefore, the process must terminate at a one-digit number, proving that every positive integer ( N ) has a finite depth.   (blacksquare) Part (b)1. Define ( x(n) ) to be the minimal positive integer with depth ( n ). Find the residue of ( x(5776) mod 6 ):   - To find ( x(n) ), we need to understand the minimal number that requires ( n ) applications of ( S(cdot) ) to reach a one-digit number.   - For depth ( n = 1 ), the minimal number is 10 (since ( S(10) = 1 )).   - For depth ( n = 2 ), the minimal number is 19 (since ( S(19) = 10 rightarrow S(10) = 1 )).   - For depth ( n = 3 ), the minimal number is 199 (since ( S(199) = 19 rightarrow S(19) = 10 rightarrow S(10) = 1 )).   - Generally, for depth ( n ), the minimal number ( x(n) ) is of the form ( 1underbrace{99ldots9}_{n-1 text{ nines}} ).   Therefore, ( x(5776) = 1underbrace{99ldots9}_{5775 text{ nines}} ).   - To find ( x(5776) mod 6 ), we note that the sum of the digits of ( x(5776) ) is ( 1 + 9 times 5775 = 1 + 51975 = 51976 ).   - The residue of ( 51976 mod 6 ) can be found by summing the digits of 51976: ( 5 + 1 + 9 + 7 + 6 = 28 ).   - The residue of ( 28 mod 6 ) is ( 4 ).   Therefore, ( x(5776) mod 6 = 4 ).   (boxed{4}) Part (c)1. Find the residue of ( x(5776) - x(5708) mod 2016 ):   - From the previous part, we know that ( x(n) = 1underbrace{99ldots9}_{n-1 text{ nines}} ).   - Therefore, ( x(5776) = 1underbrace{99ldots9}_{5775 text{ nines}} ) and ( x(5708) = 1underbrace{99ldots9}_{5707 text{ nines}} ).   - The difference ( x(5776) - x(5708) ) is essentially the difference between a number with 5775 nines and a number with 5707 nines:     [     x(5776) - x(5708) = 10^{5708} times (10^{67} - 1)     ]   - To find the residue modulo 2016, we need to consider the properties of powers of 10 modulo 2016. Note that ( 2016 = 2^5 times 3^2 times 7 ).   - Using Euler's theorem, ( 10^{phi(2016)} equiv 1 mod 2016 ), where ( phi(2016) = 2016 times (1 - frac{1}{2}) times (1 - frac{1}{3}) times (1 - frac{1}{7}) = 576 ).   - Therefore, ( 10^{5708} equiv 10^{5708 mod 576} equiv 10^{500} mod 2016 ).   - Calculating ( 10^{500} mod 2016 ) is complex, but we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to simplify:     [     10^{500} mod 32, quad 10^{500} mod 9, quad 10^{500} mod 7     ]     - ( 10^{500} mod 32 = 0 ) (since ( 10^5 = 100000 equiv 0 mod 32 )).     - ( 10^{500} mod 9 = 1 ) (since ( 10 equiv 1 mod 9 )).     - ( 10^{500} mod 7 = 4 ) (since ( 10 equiv 3 mod 7 ) and ( 3^6 equiv 1 mod 7 )).   - Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we combine these results to find ( 10^{500} mod 2016 ).   - Finally, we find the residue of ( x(5776) - x(5708) mod 2016 ).

For the intersection point (S) of both lines and the coordinates (left(x_{S}, y_{S}right)), it holds that (fleft(x_{S}right) = gleft(x_{S}right)), i.e., (-frac{1}{a} x_{S} + 1 = x_{S}) or (1 = left(1 + frac{1}{a}right) cdot x_{S} = frac{a+1}{a} cdot x_{S}), thus (y_{S} = x_{S} = frac{a}{a+1}).Therefore, the height (h_{a}) from (S) to (A B) has the length (h_{a} = y_{s} = frac{a}{a+1}) and the height (h_{d}) from (s) to (A D) has the length (h_{d} = x_{s} = frac{a}{a+1}).

From the drawn graph, it follows that a, b, and c are negative. Indeed, a is negative because the branches of the parabola are directed downwards. The free term c is negative because it equals the value of the trinomial at x=0. Finally, b coincides with the slope of the line b x+c, which is tangent to the graph of the trinomial at the point with abscissa x=0; it is not difficult to see that this coefficient is also negative. (Alternatively, one can notice that the abscissa of the vertex of the parabola is negative, and it equals -frac{b}{2 a}, which determines the sign of b.Since among the three numbers given to us, one is positive, it can only be the discriminant d=1 / 4. Consider the distance A B between the roots of the trinomial. By the condition, it equals 1. On the other hand, subtracting the formulas for the roots of the quadratic trinomial from each other, one can express this distance in terms of a and d:1=A B=frac{sqrt{d}}{|a|}=frac{1}{2|a|}We get |a|=1 / 2, that is, a=-1 / 2.

Find the probability distribution and mathematical expectation of X.","solution":" Solution:# Part 1: Probability a Batch Cannot be SoldLet's denote the event that a batch of waxberries cannot be sold as A. The probability of not passing the first round of testing is frac{1}{9}, and the probability of not passing the second round of testing is frac{1}{10}. Since the two rounds are independent, we can calculate the probability of passing both rounds and then subtract this from 1 to find the probability of not passing at least one round (i.e., cannot be sold).- Probability of passing the first round: 1 - frac{1}{9} = frac{8}{9}- Probability of passing the second round: 1 - frac{1}{10} = frac{9}{10}- Probability of passing both rounds: frac{8}{9} times frac{9}{10} = frac{72}{90} = frac{4}{5}- Probability of not passing at least one round (cannot be sold): 1 - frac{4}{5} = frac{1}{5}Thus, the probability that a batch of waxberries cannot be sold is boxed{frac{1}{5}}.# Part 2: Probability Distribution and Mathematical Expectation of XGiven that the waxberries can be sold or not, with profits of 400 yuan and -800 yuan respectively, and there are 4 batches of waxberries, we calculate the probability distribution of X (the profit from the 4 batches) and its mathematical expectation.- Possible values of X are -3200, -2000, -800, 400, and 1600 yuan, corresponding to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 batches being sold, respectively.Calculating the probabilities for each scenario:1. P(X=-3200) = (frac{1}{5})^4 = frac{1}{625}2. P(X=-2000) = C_4^1(frac{1}{5})^3(frac{4}{5}) = 4 times frac{1}{125} times frac{4}{5} = frac{16}{625}3. P(X=-800) = C_4^2(frac{1}{5})^2(frac{4}{5})^2 = 6 times frac{1}{25} times frac{16}{25} = frac{96}{625}4. P(X=400) = C_4^3(frac{1}{5})(frac{4}{5})^3 = 4 times frac{1}{5} times frac{64}{125} = frac{256}{625}5. P(X=1600) = (frac{4}{5})^4 = frac{256}{625}The probability distribution of X is summarized as follows:| X    | -3200 | -2000 | -800 | 400 | 1600 ||--------|---------|---------|--------|-------|--------|| P(X) | frac{1}{625} | frac{16}{625} | frac{96}{625} | frac{256}{625} | frac{256}{625} |To find the mathematical expectation E(X):E(X) = -3200 times frac{1}{625} - 2000 times frac{16}{625} - 800 times frac{96}{625} + 400 times frac{256}{625} + 1600 times frac{256}{625} = 640Therefore, the mathematical expectation of X is boxed{640} yuan."},{"problem":"Let the set A={x|x^{2}-2x=0}, and B={0,1}.

Therefore, the slope k = 3x^2 - 6x = -3,  which gives x = 1. This means the x-coordinate of the tangent point is 1. Substituting into the curve equation gives the coordinates of the tangent point as (1, -2).  Since this point also lies on the tangent line,  substituting into y = -3x + b gives b = 1.  Therefore, the value of the constant b is boxed{1}.  From the geometric meaning of the derivative, the slope of the tangent line at the point on the curve is equal to the value of the derivative at that point. By combining this with the fact that the tangent point must lie on the curve, we can solve for the constants b and c.  This question primarily examines the geometric meaning of derivatives, the concept of the slope of a line, and other fundamental knowledge, focusing on computational and problem-solving skills.

These n lines have no skew lines among them (all are within the (n+1)-th plane). Note that the intersection line (n+1,1) is not skew with the original n planes' intersection lines (1,2)(1,3), cdots,(1, n) (all are in plane 1), so (n+1,1) can only form skew lines with the intersection lines of planes 2,3, cdots, n, and thus (n+1,1) can form at most C_{n-1}^{2} pairs of skew lines with the original intersection lines.Similarly, (n+1,2), cdots,(n+1, n) can each form at most C_{n-1}^{2} pairs of skew lines with the original intersection lines.

How should the first sage play to his advantage? How should the second sage play? How much will the second sage pay the first if both play optimally? (Compare with problem underline{78710} and problem underline{78716}.)","solution":"Answer: with correct play, the difference between the remaining numbers is 32 (as they say, the \\"cost of the game\\" is 32). The following considerations lead to this answer: the first player aims to maximize the difference between the remaining numbers and should always try to \\"thin out\\" the remaining set of numbers as much as possible, while it is advantageous for the second player to cross out numbers \\"from the edges.\\" Of course, these considerations do not constitute a rigorous proof. To fully justify the answer, in this problem (as in the analysis of any game situation), two statements need to be proven: 1) no matter how the second player plays, the first can achieve no less than 32; 2) no matter how the first player plays, the second can lose no more than 32. To prove statement 1), we will indicate a strategy for the first player that guarantees, regardless of the second player's moves, that the difference between the two remaining numbers will be no less than 32. This strategy is described very simply: at each move, cross out every other number, i.e., the second, fourth, sixth, ... number from the remaining ones (we assume that the numbers are arranged in ascending order). Then after the 1st move, the difference between any adjacent remaining numbers will be no less than 2, after the 2nd move - no less than 4, after the 3rd move - no less than 8, after the 4th move - no less than 16, and after the 5th move - no less than 32. To prove statement 2), it is sufficient to indicate a strategy for the second player that will allow him, regardless of the first player's moves, to lose no more than 32. It consists of the following. On the first move, he crosses out all numbers less than 512 or all numbers greater than 512 (it is clear that either of these sets will not exceed 256). After this, the difference between the extreme remaining numbers will be no more than 512. Similarly, on the second move, he can ensure that all remaining numbers are in one of the segments [0, 256]; [256, 512]; [512, 768]; [768, 1024], that is, reduce the difference between the extreme numbers to at least 256. In the same way, on the 3rd move, he can reduce this difference to 128, on the 4th move - to 64, and on the 5th move - to 32. Of course, similarly, it could be proven that if the game consists of n moves and starts with the numbers 0,1,2, ldots, 2^{2 n}, then the \\"cost of the game\\" is 2^{text {n }}. However, a detailed study of a similar game starting with an arbitrary set of numbers (not necessarily an arithmetic progression) represents a significantly more difficult task.## AnswerWith correct play, the difference between the remaining numbers is 32 (as they say, the \\"cost of the game\\" is 32)."},{"problem":"In the polar coordinate system, given points Aleft(begin{matrix}1, dfrac{3}{4}piend{matrix}right) and Bleft(begin{matrix}2, dfrac{pi}{4}end{matrix}right), find the distance between points A and B.","solution":"This problem tests your understanding of the conversion between polar and rectangular coordinates, as well as the calculation of the distance between two points.

Chapter 2 OPERATIONAL CALCULUSWhen studying the topic of OPERATIONAL CALCULUS, you will become familiar with the concepts of the original function and its image (by Laplace), study the properties of originals and images, and learn to apply them to solve ordinary differential equations and systems using the operational method.Using the RESHEBNIK VM package, you will be able to compute integrals, find the partial fraction decomposition of rational functions, compute derivatives, and perform all other actions necessary for studying the topic. Once you are proficient in it, you will be able to compute images and restore originals from their images with simple keystrokes on the computer keyboard, using the capabilities of the STEM Plus module, which is part of the RESHEBNIK VM package. 2.1. Concepts of Original and Image Problem Statement. Prove that the function f(t) is an original and find its image (by Laplace). Plan of Solution. A complex-valued function f(t) of a real variable t is called an original if it satisfies three conditions:a) f(t) equiv 0 for all t<0 and s geqslant 0 such that|f(t)|<M e^{s t} quad text{for all } t>0The smallest number s for which this inequality holds is called the growth indicator of the function f(t).If f(t) is an original, then its Laplace transform F(p) (where p is a complex variable) is defined by the formulaF(p)=int_{0}^{infty} e^{-p t} f(t) d tThe function F(p) of the complex variable p is also called the image (by Laplace) of the function f(t). The connection between the original and the image is denoted by the symbolf(t) longleftrightarrow F(p) .Remark. In the half-plane operatorname{Re} p>s (where s is the growth indicator of the original f(t)), the integral (1) converges absolutely and defines an analytic function F(p).1. We prove that the function f(t) is an original by verifying the conditions a)-c). We determine the growth indicator s of the function f(t).2. We find the"},{"problem":"Find the largest positive integer n such that the number (2n)! ends with 10 more zeroes than the number n!.[i]Proposed by Andy Xu[/i]","solution":"To solve the problem, we need to find the largest positive integer ( n ) such that the number ( (2n)! ) ends with 10 more zeroes than the number ( n! ).1. Understanding the number of trailing zeroes in a factorial:   The number of trailing zeroes in ( k! ) is given by:   [   leftlfloor frac{k}{5} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{k}{25} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{k}{125} rightrfloor + cdots   ]   This formula counts the number of factors of 5 in ( k! ), since there are always more factors of 2 than factors of 5.2. Setting up the equation:   We need:   [   leftlfloor frac{2n}{5} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2n}{25} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2n}{125} rightrfloor + cdots = left( leftlfloor frac{n}{5} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{25} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{125} rightrfloor + cdots right) + 10   ]3. Calculating for specific values of ( n ):   Let's try ( n = 42 ):   [   leftlfloor frac{2 cdot 42}{5} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2 cdot 42}{25} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{84}{5} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{84}{25} rightrfloor = 16 + 3 = 19   ]   [   leftlfloor frac{42}{5} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{42}{25} rightrfloor = 8 + 1 = 9   ]   Therefore, ( (2 cdot 42)! ) ends with ( 19 ) zeroes and ( 42! ) ends with ( 9 ) zeroes. The difference is ( 19 - 9 = 10 ).4. Checking ( n = 43 ):   [   leftlfloor frac{2 cdot 43}{5} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2 cdot 43}{25} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{86}{5} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{86}{25} rightrfloor = 17 + 3 = 20   ]   [   leftlfloor frac{43}{5} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{43}{25} rightrfloor = 8 + 1 = 9   ]   Therefore, ( (2 cdot 43)! ) ends with ( 20 ) zeroes and ( 43! ) ends with ( 9 ) zeroes. The difference is ( 20 - 9 = 11 ).Since ( n = 43 ) results in a difference of 11 zeroes, which is more than 10, the largest ( n ) that satisfies the condition is ( n = 42 ).The final answer is ( boxed{42} )."},{"problem":"Ancient Chinese mathematics has many astonishing achievements.

The corresponding value of frac{x_k+y_k-|x_k-y_k|}{2} is 0 for the first three cases and 1 for the last case.Therefore, each element in B should contain an odd number of 1s, which implies that the elements in B can only be (the paired elements are called complementary):(1,0,0,0), (0,1,0,0), (0,0,1,0), (0,0,0,1)or(0,1,1,1), (1,0,1,1), (1,1,0,1), (1,1,1,0)Any two elements with exactly one 1 from B will satisfy that M(alpha,beta) is even.

Let the sides of triangle ABC be a, b, c and the sides of triangle A'B'C' be a', b', c'. We know that a < a', a < b < c, and a = 8.2. Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. Therefore, we can write:   [   frac{a'}{a} = frac{b'}{b} = frac{c'}{c} = k   ]   where k is the similarity ratio.3.

Also, a' = k cdot 8 must be an integer, which implies that k must be a rational number.6. Let's consider the possible values for b and c. Since a = 8, we need b and c to be integers greater than 8. We also need to ensure that b and c are such that a' = k cdot 8 is an integer.7. We can express c in terms of b and a using the similarity condition. Since c = frac{b^2}{a}, we have:   [   c = frac{b^2}{8}   ]8. For c to be an integer, b^2 must be divisible by 8. The smallest integer b that satisfies this condition is b = 12 (since 12^2 = 144 and 144 is divisible by 8).9. Substituting b = 12 into the equation for c, we get:   [   c = frac{12^2}{8} = frac{144}{8} = 18   ]10. Therefore, the sides of triangle ABC are 8, 12, 18.11. For the second triangle triangle A'B'C', we have a' = k cdot 8, b' = 12, and c' = 18. Since a' = k cdot 8 and k = frac{b'}{b} = frac{12}{8} = frac{3}{2}, we get:    [    a' = frac{3}{2} cdot 8 = 12    ]12. Therefore, the sides of triangle A'B'C' are 12, 12, 18.13. However, we need to check if there is another possible solution. If we consider the second triangle to have sides frac{a^2}{b}, a, b and c = frac{b^2}{a}, we need to ensure that a + b > frac{b^2}{a}.14. Substituting a = 8 and b = 12, we get:    [    frac{8^2}{12} = frac{64}{12} = frac{16}{3}    ]    which is not an integer. Therefore, this case does not provide a valid solution.15.

Therefore, the smallest possible sizes for these fractions are (5, 6, 7, ldots, 14).2. Total Number of Deputies:   Calculate the total number of deputies initially:   [   5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 = sum_{i=5}^{14} i   ]   Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:   [   sum_{i=5}^{14} i = frac{n}{2} times (text{first term} + text{last term})   ]   where (n = 10) (the number of terms):   [   sum_{i=5}^{14} i = frac{10}{2} times (5 + 14) = 5 times 19 = 95   ]   So, there are 95 deputies in total.3. Formation of New Fractions:   After the vacation, no two deputies from the same initial fraction can be in the same new fraction. Therefore, each new fraction can have at most one deputy from each of the original fractions.4. Maximum Number of Deputies in New Fractions:   Since there are 10 original fractions, each new fraction can have at most 10 deputies (one from each original fraction). To maximize the number of deputies in new fractions, we need to form as many new fractions as possible, each with 10 deputies.5. Calculation of Deputies in New Fractions:   The maximum number of deputies that can be in new fractions is:   [   10 times 10 = 100   ]   However, this exceeds the total number of deputies (95), so we need to adjust our approach.6. Optimal Distribution:   To find the optimal distribution, consider the following:   - We can form new fractions with sizes ranging from 5 to 10 (since each new fraction can have at most one deputy from each of the original fractions).   - For each (5 leq i leq 10), create a new fraction consisting of exactly one deputy from the original fractions with sizes (15-i, 16-i, ldots, 14) respectively.7. Number of Independent Deputies:   Calculate the number of deputies in new fractions:   [   5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 45   ]   Therefore, the number of independent deputies is:   [   95 - 45 = 50   ]8. Verification:   Verify that this is the smallest possible number of independent deputies:   - Since each new fraction can have at most 10 deputies, the maximum number of deputies in new fractions is 45.   - This leaves 50 deputies who must be independent.Thus, the smallest possible number of independent deputies after the vacation is (boxed{50})."},{"problem":"2. For a natural number ending not in zero, one of its digits was replaced by zero (if it is the leading digit, it was simply erased). As a result, the number decreased by 9 times. How many numbers exist for which this is possible?","solution":"Answer: 7.Solution. Let's represent the original number in the form m+10^{k} a+10^{k+1} n, where a is a decimal digit, and k, m, n are non-negative integers, with m>0, otherwise m=a=0. Then the number 8 m is a multiple of 10 and therefore ends in 0. By the condition, the number m does not end in 0. Thus, the last digit of m is 5 and the number m is odd. Therefore, 8 m is not divisible by 16, which implies k leqslant 3. Let's consider three cases.1) Suppose k=3. Then m=125 a. Since the number m is odd and less than 1000, the digit a can take the values 1,3,5,7, which gives us 4 options.2) Suppose k=2. Then m=frac{25 a}{2}. Since the number m is odd and less than 100, the digit a is 2 or 6. These values give us another 2 options.3) Suppose k=1. Then m=frac{5 a}{4}. Since the number m is odd and less than 10, we get a=4.Note that in 1) we get four-digit numbers, in 2) - three-digit numbers, in 3) - two-digit numbers. Therefore, each number satisfying the condition of the problem falls into exactly one of the sets 1) - 3). Thus, the total number of options is 4+2+1=7."},{"problem":"Show thatsqrt{36+14 sqrt{6}+14 sqrt{5}+6 sqrt{30}}can be written as the sum of the square roots of four positive integers.","solution":"I. solution.

Therefore, none of the terms in the second parenthesis can be equal to14 sqrt{6}=2 sqrt{294}, quad 14 sqrt{5}=2 sqrt{245}, quad 6 sqrt{30}=2 sqrt{270}In other words, none of the products x y, x z, ldots, z u can be equal to 294, 245, 270. Indeed, the possible two-factor decompositions of the numbers 294=2 cdot 3 cdot 7^{2}, 245=5 cdot 7^{2}, 270=2 cdot 3^{3} cdot 5 are:begin{aligned}& 294=1 cdot 294=2 cdot 147=3 cdot 98=6 cdot 49=7 cdot 42=14 cdot 21 & 245=1 cdot 245=5 cdot 49=7 cdot 35 & 270=1 cdot 270=2 cdot 135=3 cdot 90=5 cdot 54=6 cdot 45=9 cdot 30=10 cdot 27=15 cdot 18end{aligned}Among these, only 15 cdot 18 has a sum of factors less than 34. However, from the assumption x=18, y=15, it follows that z+u leqq 3, and from this,text { either } z=u=1, quad text{or} z=2, quad u=1But both further assumptions lead to a contradiction; in the first case, 2 sqrt{z u}=2, and thus the rational part is at least 37, - in the second case, 2 sqrt{z u}=2 sqrt{2}, but there is no integer multiple of sqrt{2} on the left side, while every term on the right side is positive, and the 2 sqrt{2} term cannot cancel out. Therefore, each radical term on the left side is equal to the sum of two radical terms on the right side. From this, it also follows that x+y+z+u=36.If, for example, sqrt{x y} and sqrt{x z} could be combined, then this would also stand for sqrt{y} and sqrt{z}, so (1) on the right side would have fewer than 4 terms. We will ignore this possibility for now, assuming that there are no identical variables under the radicals in the combinable pairs, so for example,begin{aligned}& 2 sqrt{x y}+2 sqrt{z u}=14 sqrt{6} & 2 sqrt{x z}+2 sqrt{y u}=14 sqrt{5} & 2 sqrt{x u}+2 sqrt{y z}=6 sqrt{30}end{aligned}By taking the difference of the squares of (2) and (3), and (4) and (3), the radical terms disappear. Simplifying and factoring,begin{gathered}x y+z u-x z-y u=49 (x-u)(y-z)=49 x u+y z-x z-y u=25 (x-y)(u-z)=25end{gathered}We can assume that x>u, then from (5) y>z, and since x-u cannot be 49, x-u=y-z=7. From this, x-y=u-z, so according to (6) their common value is +5, or -5. We can assume that x>y, so x-y=5. Adding this to the three independent equations and x+y+z+u=36, we get: x=15, y=10, u=8, z=3.These are positive integers, they meet the requirements, and indeed,sqrt{36+14 sqrt{6}+14 sqrt{5}+6 sqrt{30}}=sqrt{15}+sqrt{10}+sqrt{8}+sqrt{3}(the approximate value of both sides is 11.5957).Judit Szentai (Budapest, Kanizsay D.

Let's check this by evaluating f(1) and f(-1):- For f(1), we have:[f(1) = frac{e}{1+e} - frac{1}{2}]Thus, left[f(1)right] = 0 because frac{e}{1+e} - frac{1}{2} is between 0 and -1, but closer to 0.- For f(-1), we have:[f(-1) = frac{1}{e+1} - frac{1}{2}]Thus, left[f(-1)right] = -1 because frac{1}{e+1} - frac{1}{2} is negative and closer to -1.Since left[f(1)right] neq left[f(-1)right] and left[f(1)right] neq -left[f(-1)right], left[f(x)right] is neither an even function nor an odd function.

Since t = 1+e^x is monotonically increasing on R, the function y = frac{1}{1+e^x} is monotonically decreasing on R. Therefore, f(x) = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{1+e^x} is an increasing function on R, making option C correct.Determining the range of left[f(x)right]:Given e^x > 0 for all x in R, we have 1+e^x > 1.

Thus, there are exactly 3^{k-1} cdot 6^{30-k} sequences in which the k-th roll is a six, and no 4, 5, or 6 values appear before it (1 leq k leq 30).The number of favorable cases is therefore the sum of these values, which can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:begin{aligned}3^{0} cdot 6^{29} + 3^{1} cdot 6^{28} + ldots + 3^{28} cdot 6 + 3^{29} = & 3^{29} left(2^{29} + 2^{28} + ldots + 2 + 1right) = & = 3^{29} cdot frac{2^{30} - 1}{2 - 1} = 3^{29} left(2^{30} - 1right)end{aligned}The total number of cases is the number of 30-element sequences containing the digits 1 through 6: 6^{30}.

What is the maximum number of stones that can be in a single pile?","solution":"Solution to Exercise 6 The statement presents a sequence of operations and describes a certain initial situation. A first idea to try in this case is to look for an invariant.A second idea is to test the statement for smaller values, for example for piles of size 0,1,2,3 and 4. After several trials, one notices that the piles always have, up to permutation, the sizes 0,1,2,3 and 4. After testing on piles of size 1,2,3,4 and 5, one realizes that the piles always have distinct values modulo 5. One hastens to prove this conjecture.Removing 4 stones from a pile is equivalent, modulo 5, to adding 1. Since one adds one stone to each of the other piles, the values of the piles all increase by 1 modulo 5. Thus, if before the operation these values were distinct modulo 5, after the operation they will remain distinct modulo 5. We have thus determined our invariant.Thus the sum of the sizes of any 4 piles will never exceed 0+1+2+3=6 and therefore no pile will ever contain more than 2020-6=2014 stones.Conversely, we now need to prove that it is always possible to ensure that a pile contains 2014 stones after a finite number of operations. For this, it suffices to never touch the pile containing 404 stones, and to perform the operation on the other piles until it is no longer possible to perform a single operation. Thus the remaining piles will have 0,1,2,3 stones at the end of the process, so there will indeed be 2020-(0+1+2+3)=2014 stones on the same pile.Graders' CommentsMany students are content with constructing the bound without showing that it is indeed optimal.

Combining both cases, we have 0 ≤ x ≤ frac{20}{3}.   Therefore, if a patient takes a 9-gram dose, the treatment will be effective for boxed{frac{20}{3}} hours.2. For 6 ≤ x ≤ 8, y = 2(4 - frac{x}{2}) + m(frac{10}{4 + (x - 6)}) = 8 - x + frac{10m}{x - 2}.   Both y = 8 - x and y = frac{10m}{x - 2} (m ≥ 1) are decreasing functions in the interval [6, 8].

Since we have 3 units, there are 3 spaces to choose from, but we cannot place C and D next to each other, effectively treating them as separate units.

The provided solution directly calculates a specific scenario which doesn't fully address the condition that C and D cannot be adjacent.

Taking the derivative: h'(x) = -frac{3}{2} left(1 - frac{1}{x^2}right) = -frac{3(x^2 - 1)}{2x^2} = -frac{3(x - 1)(x + 1)}{2x^2}, which is less than zero on the interval [1, 2], thus proving h(x) is decreasing on this interval.To find the minimum value of h(x) on [1, 2], we evaluate it at the endpoint x = 2: h(2) = -frac{3}{2}left(2 + frac{1}{2}right) = -frac{3}{2}cdot frac{5}{2} = -frac{15}{4}.

Initial Setup and Analysis:   We need to find pairs of odd integers (a) and (b) such that there exists a natural number (c) for which the expression (frac{c^n + 1}{2^n a + b}) is an integer for all natural numbers (n).2. Choosing Specific Values for (n):   Let's start by choosing (n = 2^t) for all (t). This simplifies our expression to:   [   frac{c^{2^t} + 1}{2^{2^t} a + b}   ]   For this to be an integer, the denominator (2^{2^t} a + b) must divide the numerator (c^{2^t} + 1).3. Order Analysis:   By analyzing the order of the terms, we note that every odd prime factor of (c^{2^t} + 1) is congruent to (1 mod 2^{t+1}). Since (2^{2^t} a + b) is odd, it must also be congruent to (1 mod 2^{t+1}).4. Congruence Condition:   This gives us the congruence:   [   2^{2^t} a + b equiv 1 mod 2^{t+1}   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   b - 1 equiv 0 mod 2^{t+1}   ]   This implies:   [   2^{t+1} mid b - 1   ]   Since this must hold for all (t), (b - 1) must be divisible by arbitrarily large powers of 2. Therefore, (b = 1).5. Simplifying with (b = 1):   Now, we need to check if there exists a natural number (c) such that:   [   frac{c^n + 1}{2^n a + 1}   ]   is an integer for all (n).6. Prime Factor Analysis:   For all primes (p), we have:   [   2^p a + 1 mid c^p + 1   ]   By Fermat's Little Theorem, every prime divisor of (c^p + 1) is either (1 mod p) or divides (c + 1).7. Defining (f(p)):   Let (f(p) = 2^p a + 1). We denote (s_p = gcd(c + 1, f(p))). By Fermat's Little Theorem:   [   2a + 1 equiv f(p) equiv s_p mod p   ]   Thus:   [   p mid 2a + 1 - s_p   ]   Since (s_p leq c + 1), for sufficiently large (p), we must have (s_p = 2a + 1).8. Divisibility Condition:   For large primes (p), we have:   [   2a + 1 mid f(p)   ]   This implies:   [   2a + 1 mid a (2^{p-q} - 1)   ]   for primes (p > q). Since (gcd(a, 2a + 1) = 1), it follows that:   [   2a + 1 mid 2^{p-q} - 1   ]9. Order of 2 Modulo (2a + 1):   This implies (2a + 1) divides (2^d - 1) where (d mid p - q) for all pairs of such primes. By Dirichlet's Theorem, for (k geq 2), there are large primes (p equiv 1 mod 2k) and (q equiv -1 mod 2k), so (2k nmid |p - q|). Thus, (k = 1) and:   [   2a + 1 mid 3   ]   This implies (a = 1).10. Verification:    For ((a, b) = (1, 1)), we can take (c = 2) and verify:    [    frac{2^n + 1}{2^n + 1} = 1    ]    which is an integer for all (n).The final answer is ( boxed{ (a, b) = (1, 1) } )"},{"problem":"The circumcircle of acute triangle ABC has center O.

Notice that triangle{OMB} sim triangle{QOB} because both are right triangles, and angle{OBQ} cong angle{OBM}. By frac{MB}{BO}=frac{BO}{BQ}, MB = rleft(frac{r}{4.5}right) = frac{r^2}{4.5}. However, since O is the circumcenter of triangle ABC, OM is a perpendicular bisector by the definition of a circumcenter. Hence, frac{r^2}{4.5} = 2 implies r = 3. Since we know BN=frac{5}{2} and triangle BOP sim triangle BNO, we have frac{BP}{3} = frac{3}{frac{5}{2}}. Thus, BP = frac{18}{5}.  m + n=boxed{023}.Solution 2 (fastest)Minor arc BC = 2A so angle{BOC}=2A. Since triangle{BOC} is isosceles (BO and OC are radii), angle{CBO}=(180-2A)/2=90-A. angle{CBO}=90-A, so angle{BQO}=A. From this we get that triangle{BPQ}sim triangle{BCA}. So dfrac{BP}{BC}=dfrac{BQ}{BA}, plugging in the given values we get dfrac{BP}{4}=dfrac{4.5}{5}, so BP=dfrac{18}{5}, and m+n=boxed{023}.Solution 3Let r=BO. Drawing perpendiculars, BM=MC=2 and BN=NA=2.5. From there, [OM=sqrt{r^2-4}] Thus, [OQ=frac{sqrt{4r^2+9}}{2}] Using triangle{BOQ}, we get r=3. Now let's find NP. After some calculations with triangle{BON} ~ triangle{OPN}, {NP=11/10}. Therefore, [BP=frac{5}{2}+frac{11}{10}=18/5] 18+5=boxed{023}.Solution 4Let angle{BQO}=alpha. Extend OB to touch the circumcircle at a point K. Then, note that angle{KAC}=angle{CBK}=angle{QBO}=90^circ-alpha. But since BK is a diameter, angle{KAB}=90^circ, implying angle{CAB}=alpha. It follows that APCQ is a cyclic quadrilateral.Let BP=x. By Power of a Point, [5x=4cdotfrac 9 2implies x=frac{18}{5}.]The answer is 18+5=boxed{023}.Solution 5textit{Note: This is not a very good solution, but it is relatively natural and requires next to no thinking.}Denote the circumradius of ABC to be R, the circumcircle of ABC to be O, and the shortest distance from Q to circle O to be x.  Using Power of a Point on Q relative to circle O, we get that x(x+2r) = 0.5 cdot 4.5 = frac{9}{4}. Using Pythagorean Theorem on triangle QOB to get (x + r)^2 + r^2 = frac{81}{4}. Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get that 2r^2 = 18 and therefore r = 3. Now, set cos{ABC} = y. Using law of cosines on ABC to find AC in terms of y and plugging that into the extended law of sines, we get frac{sqrt{4^2 + 5^2 - 2 cdot 4 cdot 5 x}}{sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2R = 6. Squaring both sides and cross multiplying, we get 36x^2 - 40x + 5 = 0. Now, we get x = frac{10 pm sqrt{55}}{18} using quadratic formula. If you drew a decent diagram, B is acute and therefore x = frac{10 + sqrt{55}}{18}(You can also try plugging in both in the end and seeing which gives a rational solution). Note that BP = 3frac{1}{sin{OPB}} = frac{3}{cos{angle ABC - angle QBO}}. Using the cosine addition formula and then plugging in what we know about QBO, we get that BP = frac{162}{2cos{B} + sqrt{5}sin{B}}. Now, the hard part is to find what sin{B} is. We therefore want frac{sqrt{324 - (10 + sqrt{55})^2}}{18} = frac{sqrt{169 - 20sqrt{55}}}{18}. For the numerator, by inspection (a + bsqrt{55})^2 will not work for integers a and b. The other case is if there is (asqrt{5} + bsqrt{11})^2. By inspection, 5sqrt{5} - 2sqrt{11} works. Therefore, plugging all this in yields the answer, frac{18}{5} rightarrow boxed{23}.

Therefore,frac{6}{5} cdot frac{s}{x} + frac{6}{5} cdot frac{s}{x-1} = sorfrac{1}{x} + frac{1}{x-1} = frac{5}{6}By simplifying, we get the equation 5 x^{2} - 17 x + 6 = 0, whose solutions are 3 and frac{2}{5}.Since x must be greater than 1, we conclude that the time required for the bus to travel the distance from B to A (or vice versa) is 3 hours.## NATIONAL MATHEMATICS COMPETITION## 3rd grade - high school - B variant  Šibenik, April 29, 2010.IF A STUDENT HAS A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO SOLVING THE TASK, THE COMMITTEE IS OBLIGED TO GRADE AND EVALUATE THAT APPROACH IN AN APPROPRIATE MANNER."},{"problem":"Let the complex number z=-1-i (where i is the imaginary unit), and bar{z} be the conjugate of z.

We will show that this is generally true, i.e., if P is a palindromic number with an even number of digits, then it is divisible by 11. This implies that the only solution to the problem is 11.If P has 2n digits and the first n digits are a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n}, then the second n digits, according to the condition, are a_{n}, a_{n-1}, ldots, a_{1}. Therefore, P can be written as the sum of at most n numbers of the form overline{a_{i} 00 ldots 00 a_{i}} cdot 10^{i-1}, where the number of zeros in the middle is even. (If a_{i}=0, then the corresponding term does not appear in the sum.)Such a number is an integer multiple of 100 ldots 001 (specifically, a_{i} cdot 10^{i-1} times), which can be written as 11 ldots 11 - 10 cdot 1 ldots 1. In this latter expression, the second factor being subtracted consists of 2 fewer 1s than the minuend, and thus also an even number of 1s. Since numbers consisting of an even number of 1s—being the sum of 11 times the appropriate even powers of 10—are divisible by 11, both terms in the above difference are divisible by 11, and thus the difference itself is divisible by 11.Therefore, P is a sum of multiples of numbers divisible by 11, and thus is indeed divisible by 11. This completes the proof.Remark. It is well-known that a number is divisible by 11 if and only if the difference between the sum of the digits in the even positions and the sum of the digits in the odd positions in its decimal representation is divisible by 11—generally, the number and this difference give the same remainder when divided by 11.

Note that 5^{x}>x ln 5+1 for x>0 (which can be proven, for example, by taking the derivatives of both sides). Then for t neq 0 we get 5^{t^{2}}>t^{2} ln 5+1>t^{2}+1. Therefore, when a=1, the equation has a unique solution.Let a=5. Then the equation will take the form 5^{t^{2}}=5t^{2}+1.

The necessary subtraction can be written with the expression K_{1}=left[1+(-1)^{n}right] / 2, so a_{n}= a_{1}+7(n-1)-K_{1} and this is identical to (1).

By symmetry, this is also the probability that Bilyana has more heads than Maria. Let ( q ) be the probability that Maria and Bilyana have the same number of heads among the first ( 2023 ) coins. Since these are the only possible outcomes, we have:   [   2p + q = 1   ]2. Now consider the ( 2024 )-th coin that Maria has. There are two cases to consider:   - The ( 2024 )-th coin is a tail.   - The ( 2024 )-th coin is a head.3. If the ( 2024 )-th coin is a tail, then Maria wins if she has more heads than Bilyana among the first ( 2023 ) coins. The probability of this happening is ( p ).4.

We have two types of horses: big horses and small horses. Let's denote the number of big horses as x and the number of small horses as y. The problem states two key pieces of information:1. Together, the big and small horses total 100. This gives us our first equation:[x + y = 100]2. One big horse can pull 3 pieces of tiles, and three small horses can pull 1 piece of tile. This means for every big horse, we count 3 pieces of tiles, and for every small horse, we count frac{1}{3} of a piece of tile since it takes three small horses to pull one piece.

To find the equation of the tangent line, we need to understand the geometric interpretation of derivatives: the derivative of a function at a specific point is equal to the slope of the curve at that point. To solve the problem, we set up the tangent line equation using this property and utilize the fact that two lines are tangent to each other if they have exactly one point of intersection.First, find the derivative of y=x+ln x. This yields y'=1+frac{1}{x}. The slope k of the tangent line at x=1 is thus k=2. Consequently, the tangent line of y=x+ln x at x=1 is y-1=2(x-1), which simplifies to y=2x-1.Now, since the tangent line and the curve y=ax^2+(a+2)x+1 are tangent, they share exactly one point of intersection. Therefore, we can solve for a by setting the two equations equal to each other and using the discriminant of the resulting quadratic equation.Setting the equations equal, we have ax^2+(a+2)x+1=2x-1. Rearranging, this quadratic equation becomes ax^2+ax+2=0. Since aneq 0 (otherwise the curves wouldn't be tangent), we can use the discriminant triangle=a^2-8a=0 to solve for a.

Claim:   - We claim that the maximum possible value for the path number in a connected graph with independence number ( k > 1 ) is ( k-1 ).3. Construct paths:   - Consider the largest path ( P ) in the graph ( G ) with vertices ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_l ).   - Remove the vertices of ( P ) from ( G ) to get a subgraph ( G - {v_1, v_2, ldots, v_l} ).   - In this subgraph, find the largest path ( P_1 ) and continue this process to construct paths ( P_2, ldots, P_s ) until all vertices are covered.4. Show ( s le k-2 ):   - Let ( w_1, w_2, ldots, w_s ) be the first vertices of paths ( P_1, ldots, P_s ).   - We need to show that ( v_1, v_l, w_1, ldots, w_s ) form an independent set.   - Since ( P ) is the largest path, ( v_1 ) and ( v_l ) do not have any adjacent vertices outside of ( P ).   - For any ( 1 le i < j le s ), ( w_i ) and ( w_j ) cannot be adjacent because ( P_i ) is the largest path in the subgraph without vertices of ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_{i-1} ).5.

Understanding the Problem:   We are given a connected simple graph ( G ) and we know that by adding an edge ( e ) between two unconnected vertices, the diameter of the new graph ( G+e ) is at most 17.

It is worth noting, however, that there were half as many participating countries then as there are today: several European countries subsequently split up.This exercise uses reasoning techniques that have become classic and useful for a wide range of problems. First, the idea is to look for the smallest prime factor ( p ) of ( n ), using the concept of the order of 2 modulo ( p ). Since ( n ) is odd, ( p geq 3 ). The order of 2 modulo ( p ) is the smallest non-zero exponent ( b ) such that ( 2^b equiv 1 pmod{p} ), and it is shown that ( b ) divides any other exponent ( a ) such that ( 2^a equiv 1 pmod{p} ). It suffices to write the Euclidean division ( a = bq + r ) and note that ( 2^{bq} equiv 1 pmod{p} ) to deduce ( 2^r equiv 1 pmod{p} ), with ( 0 leq r < b ). Since ( b ) is the smallest positive integer satisfying this relation, necessarily ( r = 0 ) so ( a = bq ).According to Fermat's theorem, ( 2^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p} ), which implies that the order of 2 divides ( p-1 ). And since ( p ) divides ( n ), and thus ( 2^n + 1 ), and ( 2^{2n} - 1 = (2^n + 1)(2^n - 1) ), the order of 2 also divides ( 2n ). It is coprime with ( n ), since it is strictly less than ( p ) and ( p ) is, by hypothesis, the smallest divisor of ( n ) other than 1 (the order of 2 cannot obviously be 1, as for no prime ( p neq 2 ) is 1 congruent to 1 modulo ( p )). Therefore, by Gauss's theorem, it divides 2: it can only be 2, so ( p ) divides ( 2^2 - 1 = 3 ), and the smallest prime factor ( p ) of ( n ) is necessarily 3.If we were to look for integers ( n ) such that ( n ) divides ( 2^n + 1 ), there would be many, and their prime factors could be numerous, even if the smallest of them is necessarily 3. For example, if ( n ) divides ( 2^n + 1 = nq ), ( 2^n + 1 ) divides ( 2^{nq} + 1 = 2^{2^n + 1} ) because ( q ) is odd, so ( 2^n + 1 ) is also a solution. 3, 9, but also ( 513 = 2^9 + 1 ) and even one-third of 513, ( 171 = 9 times 19 ), are solutions. Only these numbers do not satisfy ( 2^n + 1 ) being divisible by ( n^2 ), because, for example, ( 2^9 + 1 = 3^3 times 19 ) is not divisible by ( 9^2 = 3^4 ).The second step of the proof is to show that ( n ) cannot be divisible by 9. Let ( n = 3^k d ), with ( k geq 1 ) and ( d ) odd and not divisible by 3. We will prove by induction on ( k ) that the highest power of 3 dividing ( 2^n + 1 ) is ( 3^{k+1} ). For ( k = 1 ), ( 2^{3d} + 1 = (2^3 + 1)(2^{3(d-1)} - 2^{3(d-2)} + cdots - 2^3 + 1) ). The second parenthesis contains a sum of ( d ) terms all congruent to 1 modulo 9, since ( 2^3 equiv -1 pmod{9} ), so it is congruent to ( d ) modulo 9, which implies that it is not a multiple of 3, and the first parenthesis is precisely 9, which initializes the induction by proving the result for ( k = 1 ), regardless of the factor ( d ). Now if the result is true for a given ( k geq 1 ), since ( 2^{3n} + 1 = (2^n + 1)(2^{2n} - 2^n + 1) ) and ( 2^n equiv -1 pmod{3^{k+1}} ), ( 2^{2n} - 2^n + 1 equiv 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 pmod{9} ) is divisible by 3 but not by 9, which completes the proof. It follows that if ( k geq 2 ) and ( n = 3^k d ), the highest power of 3 dividing ( 2^n + 1 ) is ( 3^{k+1} ), while ( n^2 ) is divisible by ( 3^{2k} ). Therefore, a solution to our problem must be a multiple of 3 and not a multiple of 9.This result generalizes by an analogous proof: for a given prime ( p ), if we denote ( v_p(n) ) the exponent of the highest power of ( p ) dividing ( n ), and if ( a ) and ( b ) are integers such that ( p ) divides ( a - b ) but does not divide ( a ) or ( b ), then:[v_p(a^n - b^n) = v_p(a - b) + v_p(n)]This is the LTE (Lifting The Exponent) theorem, which allows solving many exercises. In the present problem, we apply this LTE theorem for ( p = 3 ), ( a = 2 ), and ( b = -1 ).What can we say now about the factor ( d )? For which values of ( d ) not multiples of 3 is ( 2^n + 1 ) divisible by ( n^2 ) with ( n = 3d )? Let ( p ) be the smallest prime factor of ( d ) (( p geq 5 )). The order of 2 modulo ( p ) divides ( p-1 ) by Fermat's theorem, but it also divides ( 2n = 6d ) since ( 2^{2n} equiv 1 pmod{p} ), and it does not divide ( n ) since ( 2^n equiv -1 pmod{p} ), so it is even. Since it is strictly less than ( p ), the smallest prime factor of ( d ), it is coprime with ( d ). Therefore, it divides 6 (by Gauss's theorem). The only even divisors of 6 are 2 and 6, but 2 cannot be the order of 2 because ( 2^2 - 1 = 3 ) has no prime factor other than 3, and it cannot be the order of 6 because ( 2^6 - 1 = 3^2 times 7 ) has ( p = 7 ) as its only prime factor different from 3, but 7 is not of order 6 but of order 3 (it divides ( 2^3 - 1 ), so it also divides ( 2^{3d} - 1 ) and not ( 2^{3d} + 1 )). Since ( d ) cannot have a smallest prime factor, ( d = 1 ), so the only integer ( n ) such that ( frac{2^n + 1}{n^2} ) is an integer, besides the trivial solution ( n = 1 ), is ( n = 3 )."},{"problem":"The domain of the function f(x) = log_a(2^{x} - 1) (a > 0 and a neq 1) is (  ).A: (0, +infty)B: (-infty, 0)C: (-infty, 1)D: (1, +infty)","solution":"To ensure the function f(x) is well-defined, the argument of the logarithm must be positive.

Therefore:   [   f(x + y + f(y)) = x + 2f(y)   ]6. Now, substitute ( y ) with ( x + y ) in ((alpha)):   [   f(f(x) + (x + y)) = x + f(x + y)   ]7. By ((alpha)), we have:   [   f(x + y + f(x)) = x + f(x + y)   ]8. From the above, we can infer:   [   f(x + y + f(y)) = x + 2f(y)   ]   and   [   f(x + y + f(x)) = x + f(x + y)   ]9. By comparing these two equations, we get:   [   x + 2f(y) = x + f(x + y)   ]10. Therefore:    [    f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)    ]11. The functional equation ( f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) ) is the Cauchy functional equation. Since ( f : mathbb{R}_+ to mathbb{R}_+ ) and ( f ) is strictly increasing, the only solution is:    [    f(x) = cx    ]    for some constant ( c ).12. Substitute ( f(x) = cx ) back into the original equation ((alpha)):    [    f(f(x) + y) = f(cx + y) = c(cx + y) = c^2x + cy    ]    and    [    x + f(y) = x + cy    ]13. Equating both sides, we get:    [    c^2x + cy = x + cy    ]14. Therefore:    [    c^2x = x    ]15. Since ( x neq 0 ), we have:    [    c^2 = 1    ]16. Since ( f : mathbb{R}_+ to mathbb{R}_+ ), ( c ) must be positive. Thus, ( c = 1 ).17. Therefore, the function is:    [    f(x) = x    ]The final answer is ( boxed{f(x) = x} )."},{"problem":"6.

On his first move, Vasya always fills the edge glass (let's assume it is the first one; otherwise, we can renumber the glasses in reverse order). By 2), it is sufficient to show that Vasya can avoid a draw. Consider two cases.a) n is odd. Vasya can play arbitrarily. A draw is impossible because in this case, the last glass would have been filled by Petya, which contradicts 1).b) n=2 m n p u ~ m geqslant 4. On his second move, Vasya must fill a glass with an even number greater than 2. This is possible because there are at least three glasses with such numbers, and thus one of them is empty. Vasya can then play arbitrarily. Suppose the game ends in a draw. Then m glasses with lemonade are placed in positions 2,3, ldots, 2 m. They must be on even positions, as no two glasses stand next to each other. But this is impossible, as there are only m even positions, and one of them has already been used by Vasya."},{"problem":"Given the functions f(x)=ax^{2}-2ax+a+ frac {1}{3}(a > 0) and g(x)=bx^{3}-2bx^{2}+bx- frac {4}{27}(b > 1), determine the number of zeros of the function y=g(f(x)).","solution":"Since f(x)=ax^{2}-2ax+a+ frac {1}{3}(a > 0) and g(x)=bx^{3}-2bx^{2}+bx- frac {4}{27}(b > 1),we have y=g(f(x))=b(ax^{2}-2ax+a+ frac {1}{3})^{3}-2b(ax^{2}-2ax+a+ frac {1}{3})^{2}+b(ax^{2}-2ax+a+ frac {1}{3})- frac {4}{27}.Taking the derivative, we get y′=3b(ax^{2}-2ax+a+ frac {1}{3})^{2}(2ax-2a)-4b(ax^{2}-2ax+a+ frac {1}{3})(2ax-2a)+b(2ax-2a).Solving y′=0, we obtain x_{1}=1, x_{2}=1- frac { sqrt {6a}}{3a}, x_{3}=1+ frac { sqrt {6a}}{3a}.Therefore, the function y=g(f(x)) has 4 zeros.So the answer is: boxed{4}.First, find the derivative of the function y=g(f(x)).

In this way, the number of pieces of news known to each person doubles every hour.

Considering that the tangent is negative and it is positive only in the third quadrant, we can conclude that α must be in the second quadrant, which means cos α < 0.The angle (π - α) is the supplementary angle of α. The cosine of a supplementary angle equals the negative of the cosine of the original angle: cos(π - α) = -cos α. To find the value of cos α, we can use the identity 1 + tan^2 α = sec^2 α, or equivalently, cos^2 α = frac{1}{1 + tan^2 α}. Plugging in the value for tan α, we get:cos^2 α = frac{1}{1 + left(-frac{12}{5}right)^2} = frac{1}{1 + frac{144}{25}} = frac{1}{frac{169}{25}} = frac{25}{169}Since cos α < 0, we have cos α = -sqrt{frac{25}{169}} = -frac{5}{13}.

Since a cosine function is symmetric about its maximum (or minimum) value and cos(2(-frac{pi}{3}) - frac{pi}{3}) = cos (-pi) = 1 is a maximum value for the cosine function, the axis x = -frac{pi}{3} is indeed an axis of symmetry.
