The volume (V) of this tetrahedron is given by:   [   V = frac{1}{6} times text{base area} times text{height}   ]   The base is a right triangle with sides (frac{a^2}{x_0}) and (frac{b^2}{y_0}), so its area is:   [   text{Base area} = frac{1}{2} times frac{a^2}{x_0} times frac{b^2}{y_0} = frac{a^2 b^2}{2 x_0 y_0}   ]   The height of the tetrahedron is (frac{c^2}{z_0}). Therefore, the volume is:   [   V = frac{1}{6} times frac{a^2 b^2}{2 x_0 y_0} times frac{c^2}{z_0} = frac{a^2 b^2 c^2}{6 x_0 y_0 z_0}   ]5. To minimize this volume, we use the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality:   [   frac{x_0 y_0 z_0}{abc} leq left( frac{frac{x_0^2}{a^2} + frac{y_0^2}{b^2} + frac{z_0^2}{c^2}}{3} right)^{3/2}   ]   Since (frac{x_0^2}{a^2} + frac{y_0^2}{b^2} + frac{z_0^2}{c^2} = 1), we have:   [   frac{x_0 y_0 z_0}{abc} leq left( frac{1}{3} right)^{3/2} = frac{1}{3sqrt{3}}   ]6. Equality in AM-GM holds when:   [   frac{x_0}{a} = frac{y_0}{b} = frac{z_0}{c} = frac{1}{sqrt{3}}   ]   Therefore, (x_0 = frac{a}{sqrt{3}}, y_0 = frac{b}{sqrt{3}}, z_0 = frac{c}{sqrt{3}}).7. Substituting these values into the volume formula:   [   V = frac{a^2 b^2 c^2}{6 x_0 y_0 z_0} = frac{a^2 b^2 c^2}{6 left( frac{a}{sqrt{3}} right) left( frac{b}{sqrt{3}} right) left( frac{c}{sqrt{3}} right)} = frac{a^2 b^2 c^2}{6 frac{abc}{3sqrt{3}}} = frac{3sqrt{3} abc}{6} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} abc   ]8.

Furthermore, since the chords are of equal length and not zero, the amplitude A must be greater than frac {2+1}{2} = frac {3}{2}, i.e., A> frac {3}{2}.

This implies that Delta = k^2 - 4ksqrt{e} + 4e = (k - 2sqrt{e})^2 leq 0, and thus k = 2sqrt{e}. The equation of the line is then y = 2sqrt{e}x - e.   Now, let's prove that phi(x) leq 2sqrt{e}x - e holds for all x > 0. Let G(x) = 2sqrt{e}x - e - phi(x) = 2sqrt{e}x - e - 2eln x.   G'(x) = 2sqrt{e} - frac{2e}{x} = frac{2sqrt{e}x - 2e}{x} = 2sqrt{e}frac{x - sqrt{e}}{x}.   When x = sqrt{e}, G'(x) = 0. When 0  0.   Thus, when x = sqrt{e}, G(x) attains its minimum value, which is 0. This is also the global minimum of G(x).   Therefore, G(x) = 2sqrt{e}x - e - phi(x) geq 0, meaning that phi(x) leq 2sqrt{e}x - e holds for all x > 0.   Hence, functions h(x) and phi(x) have a unique isolating line, which is boxed{y = 2sqrt{e}x - e}."},{"problem":"7. Romeo, Giulietta, Elena, Paride, Ulysses sit on a bench.

In principle, two possibilities are conceivable: either epsilon lies in the same half-space generated by the base as D (then D lies on epsilon), or the plane epsilon lies in the corresponding other half-space. Since the further conditions do not depend on which of the two cases occurs, symmetrical structures arise, so we can assume w.l.o.g. that epsilon lies in the upper half-space together with D, so that both D and D' are points on epsilon.According to condition b), D' lies on the surface of the two spheres centered at points B and C with radius a. Since h < a, these two spheres are intersected by epsilon (and not just touched), resulting in two circles k_B; k_C as intersection figures in the plane epsilon. These two circles intersect in up to two points, one of which is D (since |BD| = |CD| = a also holds) and the other (if it exists) is D'.A second intersection point would only not exist if the circles only touched at D. Since the centers M_B and M_C of the two circles, like the sphere centers B and C, have the distance a (since epsilon is parallel to the base), their equal radii would thus add up to a and in the right triangle triangle BM_BD the Pythagorean theorem would yield the relationship left|BM_Bright|^2 + left|M_BDright|^2 = |BD|^2 or h^2 + frac{a^2}{4} = a^2, thus h = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} a. However, in a regular tetrahedron, h = frac{sqrt{6}}{3} a, so the circles do not just touch and there is therefore another point D' besides D that satisfies conditions a) and b).Since |AD| = a, condition c) also rules out D = D'. Let's now calculate the distance from A to the second intersection point D' of the two circles:The two intersection points of two circles are symmetric with respect to the line connecting the two centers. Since the plane epsilon_1, which is perpendicular to the base and passes through the line BC, is also perpendicular to epsilon and there passes through the line M_B M_C, D is thus transformed into D' by reflection at epsilon_1. Due to the orthogonality of epsilon_1 to both epsilon and the base, the foot of the perpendicular L_D from D to the base is also transformed into the foot of the perpendicular L_{D'} from D' to the base by reflection at epsilon_1: The perpendiculars are parallel to the reflection plane. When considering only in the base, L_D is thus transformed into L_{D'} by reflection at the line BC.Since in the equilateral triangle triangle ABC the medians and altitudes coincide and L_D is the centroid of this triangle, the line AL_D as a median and at the same time an altitude is perpendicular to BC and passes through its midpoint M. In particular, the reflection point L_{D'} also lies on this line and it holds thatleft|AL_{D'}right| = left|AL_Dright| + 2 cdot left|L_D Mright| = frac{2}{3} s + 2 cdot frac{1}{3} s = frac{4}{3} swhere s is the length of the median in the equilateral triangle with side length a. For this, in the right triangle triangle ABM the relationship s^2 + frac{a^2}{4} = a^2 holds and thus s^2 = frac{3}{4} a^2. Substitution yieldsleft|AL_{D'}right|^2 = frac{16}{9} s^2 = frac{4}{3} a^2.In the right triangle triangle AL_{D'}D', we finally haveleft|AD'right|^2 = left|AL_{D'}right|^2 + left|L_{D'}D'right|^2 = frac{4}{3} a^2 + h^2 = frac{4}{3} a^2 + frac{2}{3} a^2 = 2 a^2thus left|AD'right| = sqrt{2} a."},{"problem":"The minimum point of the function f(x)=x+2cos x on the interval [0,pi] is (quad)A: 0B: dfrac {pi}{6}C: dfrac {5pi}{6}D: pi","solution":"Solution: y'=1-2sin x=0, we get x= dfrac {pi}{6} or x= dfrac {5pi}{6},  thus y=x+2cos x is increasing on the interval [0, dfrac {pi}{6}], decreasing on the interval [dfrac {pi}{6}, dfrac {5pi}{6}], and increasing on [dfrac {5pi}{6},pi].  therefore x= dfrac {5pi}{6} is the point of minimum value of the function,  therefore, the correct choice is: boxed{C}.

We need to find the number of big horses (x) and the number of small horses (y).Given these conditions, we can write two equations. The first equation comes from the total number of horses.

First, we determine the total number of such tuples. This is given by the binomial coefficient ( binom{99}{5} ), since we are choosing 5 distinct integers from the set ({1, 2, ldots, 99}).3. Next, we need to calculate the sum of all possible values of ( d ) over all tuples in ( mathcal{S} ). We will use the fact that ( d ) can take any value from 4 to 98, and for each value of ( d ), we need to count how many tuples have ( d ) as the fourth element.4. For a fixed ( d ), the number of ways to choose ( a, b, c ) from ({1, 2, ldots, d-1}) is ( binom{d-1}{3} ), and the number of ways to choose ( e ) from ({d+1, d+2, ldots, 99}) is ( 99 - d ).5. Therefore, the total number of tuples with ( d ) as the fourth element is ( binom{d-1}{3} cdot (99 - d) ).6. The sum of all values of ( d ) weighted by the number of tuples is:   [   sum_{d=4}^{98} d cdot binom{d-1}{3} cdot (99 - d)   ]7. To find the average value ( D ), we divide this sum by the total number of tuples ( binom{99}{5} ):   [   D = frac{sum_{d=4}^{98} d cdot binom{d-1}{3} cdot (99 - d)}{binom{99}{5}}   ]8.

Using the hockey-stick identity for binomial coefficients, we have:   [   sum_{i=1}^{95} i cdot binom{99-i}{4} = binom{100}{6}   ]10. Therefore, the numerator becomes:    [    4 cdot binom{100}{6}    ]11. The denominator is ( binom{99}{5} ), so:    [    D = frac{4 cdot binom{100}{6}}{binom{99}{5}}    ]12.

Given Condition and Setup:   We are given a cyclic quadrilateral (ABCD) such that (AB cdot BC = 2 cdot AD cdot DC). We need to prove that the diagonals (AC) and (BD) satisfy the inequality (8BD^2 le 9AC^2).2. Area Relationship:   The given condition can be interpreted in terms of areas. Specifically, it implies that the area of triangle (ABC) is twice the area of triangle (ACD). This is because the product of the sides around the common vertex (C) is proportional to the areas of the triangles sharing that vertex.3. Intersection of Diagonals:   Let (E) be the point of intersection of diagonals (AC) and (BD). We need to analyze the triangles formed by this intersection.4. Similarity of Triangles:   From the given condition, we can infer that (Delta DHE sim Delta BHE), where (H_1) and (H_2) are the feet of the perpendiculars from (D) and (B) to (AC), respectively. This similarity gives us the ratio of the segments:   [   frac{BE}{ED} = 2   ]   Therefore, (BE = 2ED).5. Using the Ratio:   Since (BE = 2ED), let (ED = x) and (BE = 2x). The length of (BD) is then:   [   BD = BE + ED = 2x + x = 3x   ]6. Length of (AC):   The length of (AC) can be expressed in terms of (AE) and (EC).

Let's analyze the given statements step by step.Step 1: Determine the eccentricity of CGiven that the distance from the focus to the asymptote is 1, we can write the relationship as frac{|cb|}{sqrt{{a}^{2}+{b}^{2}}}=1. Since the distance from the center to the focus (denoted as c) is sqrt{3}, we have c=sqrt{3}. The eccentricity e of a hyperbola is given by e=frac{c}{a}. We need to find a and b to determine e. From the relationship frac{|cb|}{sqrt{{a}^{2}+{b}^{2}}}=1, substituting c=sqrt{3}, we get b=1. Since c^2=a^2+b^2, we can solve for a:[c^2 = a^2 + b^2 implies (sqrt{3})^2 = a^2 + 1^2 implies a^2 = 2 implies a = sqrt{2}]Thus, the eccentricity e is:[e = frac{c}{a} = frac{sqrt{3}}{sqrt{2}} = frac{sqrt{6}}{2}]Therefore, statement A is correct.Step 2: Minimum value of |PF_{2}|The minimum value of |PF_{2}| is given by c-a = sqrt{3} - sqrt{2}. This is not equal to frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, so statement B is incorrect.Step 3: Product of the slopes of lines PA and PBLet P(x_{0}, y_{0}) be a point on C. The vertices A and B are at (-sqrt{2}, 0) and (sqrt{2}, 0) respectively. The slopes of PA and PB are frac{y_{0}}{x_{0}+sqrt{2}} and frac{y_{0}}{x_{0}-sqrt{2}} respectively. The product of these slopes is:[frac{y_{0}}{x_{0}+sqrt{2}} cdot frac{y_{0}}{x_{0}-sqrt{2}} = frac{y_{0}^2}{x_{0}^2-2}]Given that frac{x_{0}^2}{2}-y_{0}^2=1, we can express y_{0}^2 as frac{x_{0}^2}{2}-1. Substituting this into the product of slopes, we get:[frac{frac{x_{0}^2}{2}-1}{x_{0}^2-2} = frac{1}{2}]Therefore, statement C is correct.Step 4: Area of triangle PF_{1}F_{2} and angle F_{1}PF_{2}Given that the area of triangle PF_{1}F_{2} is frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle to find the angle theta between PF_{1} and PF_{2}. The area is given by frac{1}{2}|PF_{1}||PF_{2}|sintheta. From the given information and the relationship between the area and the tangent of half the angle, we find that tanfrac{theta}{2}=sqrt{3}, which leads to theta = frac{2pi}{3}.

The line connecting the centers has slope -1 (since they are reflections), which leads to:[frac{b - 0}{a - (-1)} = -1 implies b = -a - 1.]The midpoint of the segment connecting the centers of the two circles lies on the line of symmetry x+y-1=0. The midpoint is left(frac{a - 1}{2}, frac{b}{2}right), and substituting this into the line equation gives:[frac{a - 1}{2} + frac{b}{2} - 1 = 0.]Combining the two conditions, we have the system of equations:[begin{cases}b = -a - 1 frac{a - 1}{2} + frac{b}{2} - 1 = 0end{cases}]Solving these equations yields a = 1 and b = 2.Hence, the equation of circle C is:[(x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 1.]boxed{(x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 1}"},{"problem":"## 16.

Representatives of the equivalence classes are: all blue, all blue with one longitudinal red ring, all blue with one transversal red ring, all blue with one longitudinal and one transversal red ring.First, show that these four classes are non-equivalent. Consider any ring, transversal or longitudinal, and count the number of red edges going out from vertices of this ring in the same half-torus. This number cannot be changed mod 2.Now we show that each configuration can be transformed to one of these four classes. We suggest two independent reasoning.Scanning of the square.Cut the torus up into a square (16 times 16). In order to restore the initial torus, we will identify the opposite sides of the square, but we will do it at the end of the solution. Now we will work with the square. It is clear that during all recolorings, each vertex of the torus has an even red degree. The same is true for the degrees of the inner vertices of the (16 times 16) square when we deal with it instead of the torus.Scan all cells of this square one by one from left to right and from bottom to top. For convenience, we may think that in each moment the scanned area is colored grey. First, we take the bottom left corner cell ( (a1) in chess notations) and color it grey. Then we consider the next cell ( (b1) in chess notations), color it grey, and if the edge between the cells (a1) and (b1) is red, change the colors of the cell (b1) edges.We obtain a grey area with no red edges in its interior. After that, when we scan each new cell, we append this cell to the grey figure and if necessary, change the colors of the edges of the new cell to make the color of all new edges in the grey area blue.The latter is always possible because the new cell has either one common edge with the grey figure (as in the case \\" (a1-b1) \\" above) or two common edges. For example, let the grey figure consist of the first row of the square and the (a2) cell. When we append the cell (b2) to the grey figure, two edges of its lower left corner vertex already belong to the grey figure, they are blue. Therefore, the other two edges (a2-b2) and (b1-b2) have the same color, and we can make them both blue (if they are not) by recoloring the edges of cell (b2).So by doing that with all cells of the square, we obtain a (16 times 16) square with blue edges inside it. Now it's time to recall that the sides of the square should be identified, and the red degree of each vertex of the torus is even. It follows that the whole (identified) vertical sides of the square are either red or blue, and the same for horizontal sides.Deformations of red loops (sketch).To see that any configuration can be made into one of the above four configurations, it is most clear to cut the torus up into a square with opposite edges identified.Since the red degree of each vertex is even, we can always find a loop consisting of red edges only. Now, suppose that one can make a (simple) red loop that does not cross the boundary of the square. We can change the color of this loop by changing one by one the colors of unit squares inside it. In the remaining configuration, every vertex is still an endpoint of an even number of red edges, and we can repeat the operation. So by doing that to every red loop, we are left with a configuration where one cannot make red loops that do not intersect the boundary. Second, any red loop left that passes through more than one boundary vertex can be deformed into a loop containing only one boundary vertex. Finally, any two loops crossing the same side of the square can be removed by changing the colors of all unit squares between these loops. Thus, we are left with only the four possibilities mentioned."},{"problem":"1.

Thus, the sample space, which represents all possible outcomes, is given by:{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}② For the second scenario, where two dice are rolled in succession and the sum of the numbers is 7 with the condition that the result of the second roll is greater than the first roll, we consider pairs of outcomes that satisfy these conditions. The pairs that meet these criteria are:{(1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4)}This is because only these pairs sum to 7 and have the second number greater than the first.# Part 2:To verify whether events A (the result is an even number) and B (the result is not less than 3) are independent, we first define the events as follows:- A = {2, 4, 6}, which represents the outcomes where the result is an even number.- B = {3, 4, 5, 6}, which represents the outcomes where the result is not less than 3.The intersection of A and B, denoted as A cap B, includes outcomes that are both even and not less than 3:A cap B = {4, 6}Next, we calculate the probabilities:- The probability of A, P(A), is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes in the sample space. Since there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes, we have:P(A) = frac{3}{6} = frac{1}{2}- Similarly, the probability of B, P(B), is the ratio of outcomes in B to the total number of outcomes. With 4 outcomes not less than 3 out of 6, we get:P(B) = frac{4}{6} = frac{2}{3}- The probability of A cap B, P(A cap B), is the ratio of outcomes that are both even and not less than 3, which gives us:P(A cap B) = frac{2}{6} = frac{1}{3}To determine if A and B are independent, we check if the product of P(A) and P(B) equals P(A cap B):P(A)P(B) = frac{1}{2} times frac{2}{3} = frac{1}{3} = P(A cap B)Since P(A cap B) = P(A)P(B), we conclude that events A and B are independent.Therefore, the final answers are encapsulated as follows:- Sample space for ①: boxed{{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}}- Possible results for ②: boxed{{(1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4)}}- Independence of A and B: boxed{text{Independent}}"},{"problem":"There is a colony consisting of 100 cells.

Volume Calculation:   To find the smallest positive integer ( n ) such that a cube with sides of length ( n ) can be divided into exactly 2007 smaller cubes, each of whose sides is of integer length, we start by considering the volume relationship. The volume of the larger cube is ( n^3 ), and the total volume of the 2007 smaller cubes must also be ( n^3 ).   [   n^3 geq 2007   ]2. Finding the Minimum ( n ):   We need to find the smallest integer ( n ) such that ( n^3 geq 2007 ). Calculating the cube root of 2007:   [   sqrt[3]{2007} approx 12.6   ]   Since ( n ) must be an integer, we take the next whole number:   [   n geq 13   ]3. Verification for ( n = 13 ):   We need to verify if ( n = 13 ) can be divided into exactly 2007 smaller cubes. First, calculate the volume of the cube with side length 13:   [   13^3 = 2197   ]   We need to check if we can partition this volume into 2007 smaller cubes with integer side lengths. One possible way to do this is to use a combination of cubes of different sizes.4. Partitioning the Volume:   Let's consider the partition:   [   13^3 = 3 cdot 3^3 + 16 cdot 2^3 + 1988 cdot 1^3   ]   - ( 3 cdot 3^3 ) represents three 3x3x3 cubes.   - ( 16 cdot 2^3 ) represents sixteen 2x2x2 cubes.   - ( 1988 cdot 1^3 ) represents 1988 1x1x1 cubes.   Calculate the total number of smaller cubes:   [   3 + 16 + 1988 = 2007   ]   This confirms that the partition is correct.5. Other Possible Partitions:   The solution also mentions other ways to dissect the cube of length 13, such as:   - {1x5, 2x3, 2x2, 2002x1}   - {1x4, 3x3, 7x2, 1996x1}   These partitions also satisfy the condition of having 2007 smaller cubes.The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 13 } )."},{"problem":"Let A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} be an equilateral triangle with the midpoints of sides A_{1} A_{2}, A_{2} A_{3}, A_{3} A_{1} being B_{3}, B_{1}, B_{2}, respectively.

If, for example, the points C_{1}^{prime}, C_{2}^{prime}, C_{3}^{prime} also satisfy the problem's requirements, and C_{3}^{prime} neq C_{3}. Assume that C_{3}^{prime} is an interior point of the segment C_{3} B_{1}. Since A_{3}, C_{3}^{prime}, C_{1}^{prime} are collinear, C_{1}^{prime} must lie in the interior of the segment C_{1} B_{3}. Similarly, since A_{1}, C_{1}^{prime}, C_{2}^{prime} are collinear, C_{2}^{prime} must lie in the interior of the segment B_{3} C_{2}. However, this means that the line A_{2} C_{3} separates the points C_{2}^{prime} and C_{3}^{prime}, so A_{2}, C_{2}^{prime}, C_{3}^{prime} cannot be collinear. We arrive at the same conclusion if C_{3}^{prime} is an interior point of the segment B_{2} C_{3}; thus, we have shown that the solution to the problem (if it exists) is unique.Rotate the points A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3} and C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3} by 120^{circ} around O. Since the points A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3} are rotations of each other, the images of C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3} also form a solution. By the uniqueness, this is only possible if C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3} map to each other under the rotation, meaning that the triangle C_{1} C_{2} C_{3} is also regular. This implies thatbegin{gathered}C_{2} B_{1}=C_{3} B_{2}=C_{1} B_{3} B_{3} C_{2}=B_{1} C_{3}=B_{2} C_{1} .end{gathered}Let the lengths of the segments in (1) and (2) be denoted by a and b, respectively, and let the side length of the triangle B_{1} B_{2} B_{3} be 1. The triangles C_{3} C_{2} B_{1} and A_{2} C_{2} B_{3} are similar because their angles are equal. Therefore, a: b = b: 1, and since a + b = 1,a: b = b: (a + b)This means that, for example, the point C_{2} divides the segment B_{1} B_{3} in the golden ratio. The equation (3) can be written as: b^{2} = a(a + b) and since a = 1 - b, b^{2} = 1 - b. From this equation, b = frac{-1 pm sqrt{5}}{2}, and since b is a positive number, b = frac{-1 + sqrt{5}}{2}. (The construction of the segment b is shown in Figure 2.)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_174d6917e0346e20323eg-1.jpg?height=404&width=548&top_left_y=1907&top_left_x=775)If, for example, the point C_{2} is constructed on the segment B_{1} B_{3} according to (3), the 60^{circ} angles at B_{1} and B_{3} and the equality of the ratios of the sides enclosing these angles will make the triangles A_{2} C_{2} B_{3} and C_{3} C_{2} B_{1} similar. This implies that the points A_{2}, C_{2}, C_{3} are collinear. Similarly, this is true for the point sets A_{3}, C_{3}, C_{1} and A_{1}, C_{1}, C_{2}, so our construction is correct.Remark. Let's consider the case when the triangle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} is not regular. It is known to those familiar with affine transformations that for any two triangles, there exists a unique affine transformation (a transformation that preserves lines) that maps the vertices of one triangle to the vertices of the other. We also know that an affine transformation preserves the division ratio of three collinear points, so it maps a midpoint to a midpoint and a point that divides a segment in the golden ratio to a point that divides a segment in the golden ratio. Therefore, for a regular triangle and any triangle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3}, there exists an affine transformation with the above properties. This means that the procedure found for the regular triangle to construct the points C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3} can be applied to any triangle.Marianna Csörnyei (Főv. Fazekas M. Gyak.

Understanding the Problem:   - We have a set ( S ) with ( |S| = 25 ).   - We need to find the maximum number of subsets of ( S ) such that any two subsets have a non-empty intersection.2. Key Insight:   - The problem is equivalent to finding the largest family of subsets of ( S ) where every pair of subsets intersects.   - A well-known result in combinatorics states that the largest such family is obtained by fixing an element and considering all subsets that contain this element.3. Constructing the Family:   - Fix an element ( x in S ).   - Consider all subsets of ( S ) that contain ( x ).   - The number of such subsets is ( 2^{n-1} ) because each subset can be formed by choosing any combination of the remaining ( n-1 ) elements.4. Maximality Argument:   - Suppose we have a family of subsets where each pair has a non-empty intersection.   - If a subset ( A ) is in the family, its complement ( S setminus A ) cannot be in the family because ( A cap (S setminus A) = emptyset ).   - Therefore, for any subset in the family, its complement is excluded.   - This implies that the family can have at most half of the total number of subsets of ( S ), which is ( frac{2^n}{2} = 2^{n-1} ).5.

Calculating the number of distinct values: Since there are 101 terms from S_{0} to S_{100}, and we have identified that S_{0} = S_{5} = 0, S_{2} = S_{3} = -3d, and S_{1} = S_{4} = -2d, we subtract the 3 non-distinct cases (considering S_{0} = S_{5} as one case, and the pairs S_{2} = S_{3} and S_{1} = S_{4} as two more cases) from 101 to get the number of distinct values:   [   text{Number of distinct values} = 101 - 3 = 98   ]Hence, the number of distinct values in S_{i} for i=1,2,ldots,100 is boxed{98}."},{"problem":"If 2in{1,x^{2}+x}, then the value of x is (   )A: (-2)B: (1)C: (1) or (-2)D: (-1) or (2)","solution":"Since 2in{1,x^{2}+x},we can get: x^{2}+x=2,solving which yields: x=1 or x=-2.Hence, the answer is boxed{text{C}}.The judgment is based on the relationship between the element and the set.This question primarily tests the understanding of the relationship between an element and a set, and is a basic question."},{"problem":"Given that the sequence {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence, and a_1+a_5=-20, a_3+a_8=-10.

Consider:    - (CE) as (2x) and (ED) as (x).   - Since (BH) is the altitude, ( angle BHC = 90^circ ).4. Triangles:   - (triangle AED cong triangle AEH) by AAS (Angle-Angle-Side) similarity. This implies that (angle AED = angle AEH).5. Triangle (EHC):   - Since ( angle BHC = 90^circ ) and (CE = 2x), (ED = x), (triangle EHC) is a right triangle with sides (x) and (2x).   - This implies (triangle EHC) is a 30-60-90 triangle, where (angle HEC = 60^circ).6. Angles:   - Since (triangle AED cong triangle AEH), (angle AED = angle AEH).   - Notice that (angle AED + angle AEH + angle HEC = 180^circ).   - Given (angle HEC = 60^circ), we have (angle AED + angle AEH + 60^circ = 180^circ).   - Therefore, (angle AED + angle AEH = 120^circ).   - Since (angle AED = angle AEH), each of these angles is (60^circ).7. Conclusion:   - (triangle AED) and (triangle AEH) are 30-60-90 triangles.   - Thus, (angle DAE = 30^circ) and (angle CAE = 30^circ).   - Therefore, (angle BAC = angle DAE + angle CAE = 30^circ + 30^circ = 60^circ).The final answer is (boxed{60^circ})."},{"problem":"Problem 7.5.

Prove that the sum of the four prime numbers is divisible by 60.(Walther Janous)","solution":"Given four prime numbers ( p, q, r, s ) such that ( 5 < p < q < r < s < p + 10 ), we need to prove that the sum of these four prime numbers is divisible by ( 60 ).1. Prime Number Properties:   - Note that any prime number greater than 3 can be expressed in the form ( 6k pm 1 ) for some integer ( k ). This is because any integer can be written as ( 6k, 6k+1, 6k+2, 6k+3, 6k+4, ) or ( 6k+5 ). Among these, ( 6k, 6k+2, 6k+3, ) and ( 6k+4 ) are not primes (except for 2 and 3 themselves).2. Case Analysis:   - We will consider two cases based on the form of ( p ).   Case 1: ( p = 6k + 1 )   - If ( p = 6k + 1 ), then the possible values for ( q, r, s ) within the range ( (p, p+10) ) are:     [     p+2 = 6k+3, quad p+4 = 6k+5, quad p+6 = 6k+7, quad p+8 = 6k+9, quad p+10 = 6k+11     ]   - Among these, ( 6k+3 ) and ( 6k+9 ) are not primes. Therefore, the possible primes are ( 6k+5, 6k+7, ) and ( 6k+11 ).   - However, ( 6k+11 ) is not within the range ( (p, p+10) ). Thus, this case does not provide a valid set of four primes.   Case 2: ( p = 6k + 5 )   - If ( p = 6k + 5 ), then the possible values for ( q, r, s ) within the range ( (p, p+10) ) are:     [     p+2 = 6k+7, quad p+4 = 6k+9, quad p+6 = 6k+11, quad p+8 = 6k+13, quad p+10 = 6k+15     ]   - Among these, ( 6k+9 ) and ( 6k+15 ) are not primes. Therefore, the possible primes are ( 6k+7, 6k+11, ) and ( 6k+13 ).   - Thus, the primes are ( p = 6k+5, q = 6k+7, r = 6k+11, s = 6k+13 ).3. Sum of Primes:   - The sum of these primes is:     [     p + q + r + s = (6k+5) + (6k+7) + (6k+11) + (6k+13) = 24k + 36     ]   - We can factor out 12:     [     p + q + r + s = 12(2k + 3)     ]   - Therefore, ( p + q + r + s ) is divisible by 12.4. Divisibility by 5:   - Since ( p, q, r, s ) are all primes greater than 5, they must be of the form ( 5m pm 1 ) for some integer ( m ).   - Considering the forms ( 6k+5, 6k+7, 6k+11, 6k+13 ), we can see that:     [     p equiv 0 pmod{5}, quad q equiv 2 pmod{5}, quad r equiv 1 pmod{5}, quad s equiv 3 pmod{5}     ]   - Summing these congruences:     [     p + q + r + s equiv 0 + 2 + 1 + 3 equiv 6 equiv 1 pmod{5}     ]   - This shows that the sum is not divisible by 5, which contradicts our earlier assumption. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the forms of ( p, q, r, s ).5. Revised Analysis:   - Given the constraints, we need to ensure that the sum is divisible by both 12 and 5. The correct forms should be re-evaluated to ensure the sum is divisible by 60.The final answer is ( boxed{60} )"},{"problem":"# Problem 8.Let A(n) denote the greatest odd divisor of the number n.

Then the altitude AT of triangle ABC contains the median of triangle AMN, that is, it intersects segment MN at its midpoint - point E (see Fig. 10.5a, b). We can reason in different ways.First method. Since MN | AB, triangles ETN and ATB are similar (see Fig. 10.5a), hence frac{TN}{TB}=frac{TE}{TA}=frac{EN}{AB}=frac{1}{4}. Let TN=x, TE=y, then BN=3x, AE=3y.Therefore, CT=CN-TN=2x, and EH=frac{1}{3}AE=y (by the property of the centroid of a triangle).Notice that in right triangles CTH and BTA, frac{CT}{BT}=frac{2x}{4x}=frac{1}{2} and frac{HT}{AT}=frac{2y}{4y}=frac{1}{2}.

Mark point K - the midpoint of side AB (see Fig. 10.5b). Then AMNK is a parallelogram, its diagonal MK passes through the midpoint of AN, so it also passes through point H.Since MH | BC, triangles EMH and ENT are equal (by side and two adjacent angles), hence EH=ET. The median CK of triangle ABC passes through point E and is bisected at it, so CHKT is a parallelogram, thus TK | CH.But CH is part of the altitude CQ of triangle ABC, so TK perp AB. Thus, TK is both an altitude and a median of the right triangle ATB, meaning this triangle is isosceles, so angle ABC=45^{circ}.There are other ways to solve this problem.

However, in the case of the smallest three-digit number, 12 digits are used: 100^{2}=10000,100^{3}=1000000, so the numbers in question are all two-digit.For every two-digit number n, the number of digits in its square is: a=3, or 4, because 10^{2}=100 and 99^{2}=9801. The change occurs when n^{2} exceeds the smallest four-digit number, 1000. This is not a perfect square, its square root (to one decimal place) is 31.6, so 31^{2} is still three-digit, and 32^{2} is already four-digit.In the cube of two-digit numbers, the number of digits is beta=4,5, or 6, because 10^{3}=1000 and 99^{3}=970299.

Thus, the child's genotype probabilities are calculated as follows:- The probability for genotype dd is frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{4}.- The probability for genotype rr is frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{4}.- The probability for genotype rd (which can arise from two possible gamete combinations, dr or rd) is frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{2}.To exhibit the characteristic determined by the dominant gene, a child can have either a dd or rd genotype. Therefore:(1) The probability that one child will display the dominant characteristic is the sum of the probabilities for genotypes dd and rd, which is frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{2} = frac{3}{4}.[therefore P(text{one child with dominant trait}) = frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{2} = boxed{frac{3}{4}}.](2) To calculate the probability that at least one of two children displays the dominant characteristic, we first find the probability that both children are pure recessive (rr). We can then subtract this probability from 1 to find the required probability.The probability that both children have genotype rr is (frac{1}{4}) times (frac{1}{4}) = frac{1}{16}. Therefore, the probability that at least one exhibits the dominant characteristic is 1 - frac{1}{16} = frac{15}{16}.[therefore P(text{at least one child with dominant trait}) = 1 - left(frac{1}{4} right)^2 = boxed{frac{15}{16}}.]"},{"problem":"5.

Given the conditions (1 le a, b, c le 2), we need to determine the largest possible value of (T = (a - b)^{2018} + (b - c)^{2018} + (c - a)^{2018}).2. First, note that (|a - b| le 1), (|b - c| le 1), and (|c - a| le 1) because (a, b, c) are all within the interval ([1, 2]).3. Since (2018) is an even number, ((x)^{2018} = |x|^{2018}). Therefore, we can rewrite (T) as:   [   T = |a - b|^{2018} + |b - c|^{2018} + |c - a|^{2018}   ]4. To maximize (T), we need to consider the maximum values of (|a - b|), (|b - c|), and (|c - a|).

The number of lamps sold changes by -10x, making the new sales volume (600 - 10x) lamps.The profit equation becomes:[begin{align*}(40 + x - 30)(600 - 10x) &= 10000 10(600 - 10x) + x(600 - 10x) &= 10000 6000 - 100x + 600x - 10x^2 &= 10000 -10x^2 + 500x - 4000 &= 0 x^2 - 50x + 400 &= 0end{align*}]Solving this quadratic equation, we find:[x = 40 quad text{or} quad x = 10]Thus, the new selling prices are:[40 + 40 = 80 quad text{or} quad 40 + 10 = 50 quad text{(yuan)}]Therefore, the selling price of these desk lamps should be set at boxed{80 text{ yuan or } 50 text{ yuan}}.# Part 2: Possibility of Making a 15,000 Yuan Daily ProfitAssuming a profit of 15,000 yuan, the equation becomes:[begin{align*}(40 + x - 30)(600 - 10x) &= 15000 -10x^2 + 500x - 6000 &= 15000 x^2 - 50x + 900 &= 0end{align*}]The discriminant (Delta) of this quadratic equation is:[Delta = 2500 - 3600 = -1100]Since Delta < 0, this equation has no real roots, meaning it is not possible to achieve a daily profit of 15,000 yuan. Therefore, it is boxed{text{not possible}} to make a daily profit of 15,000 yuan.# Part 3: Maximizing ProfitLet the selling price of the desk lamps be x yuan, and the profit be y yuan. The profit equation is:[y = (x - 30)[600 - 10(x - 40)]]Expanding and simplifying, we get:[y = -10x^2 + 1300x - 30000]The vertex form of a quadratic equation y = ax^2 + bx + c is given by x = -frac{b}{2a}. Here, a = -10 and b = 1300, so:[x = -frac{1300}{2(-10)} = 65]At x = 65, the profit is maximized. Substituting x = 65 into the profit equation:[y_{text{max}} = -10(65)^2 + 1300(65) - 30000 = 12250]Therefore, to maximize profit, the selling price of the desk lamps should be set at boxed{65 text{ yuan}}, and the maximum profit is boxed{12250 text{ yuan}}."},{"problem":"Calculate: (-2) + 3 equals to ( )A: -5B: -1C: 1D: 5","solution":"To calculate (-2) + 3, we follow the steps:1.

Proof of the Lemma:   - Define a function ( g: V rightarrow mathbb{Q} ) which associates each vertex with the average of the degrees of vertices connected to it in ( G_1 ).   - Clearly, ( g(v) le f(v) ).   - We need to show that ( sum_{v in V} g(v) ge sum_{v in V} deg(v) = 2|E_1| ).4. Calculation:   - Let ( S ) be the set of ordered pairs of connected vertices in ( G_1 ).   - Then, ( sum_{v in V} g(v) = sum_{(u,v) in S} frac{deg(u)}{deg(v)} ).   - Let ( S_1 ) be the set of unordered pairs of connected vertices in ( G_1 ) (i.e., ( S_1 equiv E_1 )).   - Then, ( sum_{v in V} g(v) = sum_{(u,v) in S_1} left( frac{deg(u)}{deg(v)} + frac{deg(v)}{deg(u)} right) ).   - By the AM-GM inequality, ( frac{deg(u)}{deg(v)} + frac{deg(v)}{deg(u)} ge 2 ).   - Therefore, ( sum_{v in V} g(v) ge sum_{(u,v) in S_1} 2 = 2|S_1| = 2|E_1| ).5. Return to the main problem:   - Define a function ( h ) that associates each vertex with the number of edges in ( E_3 ) which start from it.   - Clearly, ( frac{1}{2} sum_{v in V} h(v) = |E_3| ).6. Relate ( h(v) ) and ( f(v) ):   - Note that ( h(v) ge f(v) - 1 ).   - Consider the vertex ( u ) such that ( (u,v) in E_1 ) and its degree in ( G_1 ) is ( f(v) ).   - Define ( V_{1,u} ) as the set of vertices connected to ( u ) in ( G_1 ).   - Then, ( {v} times (V_{1,u} setminus {v}) subseteq E_3 ).7. Calculate ( |E_3| ):   - ( |E_3| = frac{1}{2} sum_{v in V} h(v) ge frac{1}{2} sum_{v in V} (f(v) - 1) ).   - Therefore, ( |E_3| ge frac{1}{2} left( sum_{v in V} f(v) - 2017 right) ).   - By the lemma, ( sum_{v in V} f(v) ge 2|E_1| ).   - Hence, ( |E_3| ge |E_1| - frac{2017}{2} ).8. Minimum average calculation:   - Since ( |E_3| ) is an integer, it must be at least ( |E_1| - 1008 ).   - The minimum average is reached when ( |E_3| ) is minimum.   - Therefore, the minimum average is at least:     [     frac{3(|E_1| - 1008) + |E_1| + 2 left( binom{2017}{2} - 2|E_1| + 1008 right)}{binom{2017}{2}} = frac{4033}{2017}     ]9. Verification:   - This optimal situation is reached if all edges of ( K_{2017} ) are labeled with ( 2 ) except for edges connecting ( v_{2i-1} ) and ( v_{2i} ) for ( i = 1, ldots, 1008 ), which are labeled with ( 1 ).   - It is easily verifiable that in this case, the hypothesis is respected.The final answer is (boxed{frac{4033}{2017}})"},{"problem":"9. find all functions f: mathbb{R} rightarrow mathbb{R} such that x, y in mathbb{R} holds for all x, y in mathbb{R}:(f(x)+y)(f(x-y)+1)=f(f(x f(x+1))-y f(y-1))","solution":"Solution (Paul): Let x=0, y=1 :(f(0)+1)(f(-1)+1)=f(0)If we set y=-f(x), it immediately follows that an a in mathbb{R} exists with f(a)=0.

Consequently, a+1 neq 0, so that f(-1)=-1 follows from the last equation. If we insert this into the first equation, f(0)=0 immediately follows. For x we now insert 0 and -1 one after the other so thaty f(-y)+y=f(-y f(y-1))=(y-1)(f(-1-y)+1) Longleftrightarrow y f(-y)+f(-1-y)+1=y f(-1-y).If we replace y with -y here, we get the form:y f(y)=y f(y-1)+f(y-1)+1Now we insert y=0, y=1 one after the other into the original equation:f(x)^{2}+f(x)=f(f(x f(x+1)))=(f(x)+1)(f(x-1)+1) Longleftrightarrow f(x)^{2}=f(x) f(x-1)+f(x-1)+1.We now subtract the last two equations obtained from each other and getf(x)^{2}-x f(x)=f(x) f(x-1)-x f(x-1) Longleftrightarrow(f(x)-x)(f(x)-f(x-1))=0So if we can show for all real x that f(x) neq f(x-1) applies, f(x)=x follows and we are done.

Otherwise its colour is red.Suppose the bottom level has 2048 disks of which 2014 are red. What is the colour of the disk at the top?","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   - We have a triangular arrangement of disks.   - The bottom level has 2048 disks, of which 2014 are red.   - Each disk not at the bottom level touches two disks below it.   - A disk is blue if the two disks below it are of the same color, otherwise it is red.   - We need to determine the color of the top disk.2. Induction Hypothesis:   - Let's denote the number of disks at level ( k ) as ( 2^k ).   - We will use induction to show that the parity (even or odd number of red disks) of each level determines the color of the top disk.3. Base Case:   - For the bottom level ( k = 11 ) (since ( 2^{11} = 2048 )), we have 2014 red disks.   - The number of blue disks at this level is ( 2048 - 2014 = 34 ).4. Inductive Step:   - Assume that for level ( k ), the parity of the number of red disks determines the parity of the number of red disks at level ( k-1 ).   - Consider the transition from level ( k ) to level ( k-1 ):     - Each disk at level ( k-1 ) is determined by two disks at level ( k ).     - If both disks at level ( k ) are of the same color, the disk at level ( k-1 ) is blue.     - If the two disks at level ( k ) are of different colors, the disk at level ( k-1 ) is red.5. Parity Analysis:   - The parity of the number of red disks at level ( k ) affects the parity of the number of red disks at level ( k-1 ).   - Specifically, if the number of red disks at level ( k ) is even, the number of red disks at level ( k-1 ) will also be even.   - If the number of red disks at level ( k ) is odd, the number of red disks at level ( k-1 ) will be odd.6. Applying Induction:   - At the bottom level ( k = 11 ), we have 2014 red disks, which is even.   - By induction, the parity of the number of red disks remains even as we move up each level.   - Therefore, at the top level (level 0), the number of red disks is even.7.

(1) Please find the coordinates of the vertex and the axis of symmetry of the parabola using the completing the square method or the formula method.  (2) Write down the coordinates of the intersection points of the parabola with the y-axis.","solution":"To solve the given problem, we will address each part step by step. Part (1): Finding the Vertex and Axis of SymmetryGiven the parabola equation y = x^2 + 6x - 1, we can find the vertex and the axis of symmetry by completing the square or using the vertex formula. We'll use the completing the square method here.1. Completing the Square:   Start with the given equation:   y = x^2 + 6x - 1.   To complete the square, we need to form a perfect square trinomial on the right-hand side. We do this by adding and subtracting the square of half the coefficient of x, which is (6/2)^2 = 9:   y = x^2 + 6x + 9 - 9 - 1.   Simplify and rewrite the equation:   y = (x + 3)^2 - 10.   From this form, we can directly read off the vertex of the parabola. The vertex is at (-3, -10), and since the parabola is in the form (x-h)^2 + k where (h, k) is the vertex, the axis of symmetry is x = h. Therefore, the axis of symmetry is x = -3.   So, the coordinates of the vertex are (-3, -10), and the axis of symmetry is x = -3. Part (2): Intersection Points with the Y-axisTo find the intersection points of the parabola with the y-axis, we set x = 0 in the original equation:2.

To find the value of sin B, we use the Sine Rule in triangle ABC:begin{align*}frac{sin B}{b} &= frac{sin A}{a} sin B &= frac{b sin A}{a} &= frac{8 times frac{sqrt{3}}{2}}{7} &= frac{4sqrt{3}}{7}.end{align*}Thus, sin B = boxed{frac{4sqrt{3}}{7}}.2. To find the height on side BC for an obtuse triangle:Method 1: Using the Cosine Rulebegin{align*}a^2 &= b^2 + c^2 - 2bccos A 49 &= 64 + c^2 - 2 times 8 times c times frac{1}{2} c^2 - 8c + 15 &= 0.end{align*}Solving the quadratic equation, we find c = 5 or c = 3. Since triangle ABC is obtuse and b > a, angle B is the largest, making c=3 the valid choice because it satisfies the condition for triangle ABC to be obtuse. Thus, c = boxed{3}.Given c=3 and sin B = frac{4sqrt{3}}{7}, the height h on BC is:begin{align*}h &= c sin B &= 3 times frac{4sqrt{3}}{7} &= frac{12sqrt{3}}{7}.end{align*}Therefore, the height on side BC is h = boxed{frac{12sqrt{3}}{7}}.Method 2: Analyzing AnglesGiven b > a, B > A = frac{pi}{3}, and thus C < frac{pi}{3}. Since triangle ABC is obtuse, B is the largest angle and is obtuse. With sin B = frac{4sqrt{3}}{7}, we find cos B = -frac{1}{7}, and consequently, sin C = sin(A+B) = frac{3sqrt{3}}{14}.For the height h on BC, we have:begin{align*}h &= b sin C &= 8 times frac{3sqrt{3}}{14} &= frac{12sqrt{3}}{7}.end{align*}Thus, the height on side BC is h = boxed{frac{12sqrt{3}}{7}}."},{"problem":"Given a quadratic function f(x) = (x + a)(bx + 2a) where a, b in mathbb{R} is an even function, and its range is (-infty, 4], find the expression for f(x).","solution":"Analytical Approach: Simplify f(x).

Given that increasing work efficiency by 25% is equivalent to completing the project in (x-6) months, we can set up the equation based on the relationship between work efficiency and time. The increase in efficiency means that the work done per month is increased by 25%, which can be represented as 1.25 times the original efficiency.

In part b) of the given solution, we used a fact known as the Dirichlet principle or the pigeonhole principle. It states, for example, that if we distribute 13 items into 2 containers, at least one container will have at least 7 items. Or if we distribute 13 items into 3 containers, at least one container will have at least 5 items. Or when distributing 2n+1 items into 2 containers, at least one container will have at least n+1 items. Generally, when distributing at least kn+1 items into k containers, at least one container will have at least n+1 items (we wrote this above for k=2 and n=6, as well as for k=3 and n=4, and for k=2 and general n). The \\"items\\" can be numbers, geometric shapes, people, statements, essentially anything. The containers can then represent any properties of the individual items. For example, we often divide integers into 2 containers based on whether they are even or odd (see introductory problem N2).In our solution, we used the Dirichlet principle twice, each time for 2 containers. In the first case, the siblings played the role of \\"items\\" and gender (male/female) played the role of \\"containers\\". In the second case, the \\"items\\" were the statements and the \\"containers\\" were statements about sisters and statements about brothers.NOTE.

If the intersection point of lines l and m lies outside the segment A 1 C 1 (Fig.2), then by dropping perpendiculars A D and B E from points A and B to lines B B 1 and C C 1 respectively, we obtain similar triangles A D B and B E C, which is impossible, sincefrac{B D}{A B}=frac{3}{18}=frac{1}{6} neq frac{5}{14}=frac{C E}{B C}Similarly for the case when the intersection point of lines l and m lies on the segment A 1 C 1.

Let points P, Q and R be the orthogonal projections of points A, B and C respectively, and M be the projection of points A 1, B 1 and C 1.

Therefore, P R=16 x=16. Since M P 2+P R 2=144+256=400=M R 2, triangle M P R is a right triangle, with angle M P R=90^{circ}. Therefore, P M is perpendicular to the projection P R of the inclined line l on the plane alpha.

It remains to note that the segment MP is the orthogonal projection on the plane alpha of the common perpendicular of lines l and m.

Solution. We will prove that cos k x can be expressed as a polynomial of cos x of degree at most k. We will use induction. For k=1, the statement is obvious, and for k=2, it follows from the identity cos 2 x = 2 cos^2 x - 1. Assume that cos k x can be expressed as a polynomial of cos x of degree at most k for all k < m. Then, from the identity2 cos (m-1) x cos x = cos (m-2) x + cos m xwe have cos m x = 2 cos (m-1) x cos x - cos (m-2) x. By the induction hypothesis, cos (m-1) x is a polynomial of cos x of degree at most m-1, and cos (m-2) x is a polynomial of cos x of degree at most m-1. Therefore, the right-hand side is a polynomial of cos x of degree at most m. This proves that cos m x is a polynomial of cos x of degree at most m.From this, it follows that a_{1} cos x + a_{2} cos 2 x + ldots + a_{n-1} cos (n-1) x can be expressed as a polynomial of cos x of degree at most n-1. Therefore, there exists a polynomial p(y) of degree at most n-1 such thatp(cos x) = a_{1} cos x + a_{2} cos 2 x + ldots + a_{n-1} cos (n-1) xfor all x. If (1) holds for all x, thenp(cos x) = -a_{n} cos n xfor all x.Letx_{1} = frac{pi}{2 n}, ldots, x_{j} = frac{(2 j-1) pi}{2 n}, ldots, x_{n} = frac{(2 n-1) pi}{2 n}For each such x_{j},cos n x_{j} = cos frac{(2 j-1) pi}{2} = 0and the values y_{1} = cos x_{1}, ldots, y_{j} = cos x_{j}, ldots, y_{n} = cos x_{n} are distinct. Therefore, by (1) and (2),p(y_{j}) = p(cos x_{j}) = -a_{n} cos n x_{j} = 0Thus, y_{1}, ldots, y_{j}, ldots, y_{n} are n distinct roots of the polynomial p(y). Since p(y) is of degree at most n-1, it can only have n distinct roots if it is identically zero. Therefore,0 equiv p(cos x) equiv -a_{n} cos n xwhich implies a_{n} = 0, since cos n x is not identically zero.By repeating this argument (n-1) times, we get a_{n-1} = 0, a_{n-2} = 0, ldots, a_{1} = 0. Therefore, the function a_{1} cos x + a_{2} cos 2 x + ldots + a_{n} cos n x = f(x) is identically zero if and only if a_{1} = a_{2} = ldots = a_{n} = 0. In this case, it is indeed zero for all x.II. Solution. We will prove that if any a_{k} neq 0, then the function f(x) = a_{1} cos x + a_{2} cos 2 x + ldots + a_{n} cos n x cannot be identically zero. To this end, multiply the function f(x) by cos k x and integrate the product from 0 to 2 pi. The integral of the l-th term of f(x) cos k x, if l neq k:begin{aligned}& a_{l} int_{0}^{2 pi} cos l x cos k x , dx = frac{1}{2} a_{l} int_{0}^{2 pi} (cos (k+l) x + cos (k-l) x) , dx = & = frac{1}{2} a_{l} left[ frac{sin (k+l) x}{k+l} + frac{sin (k-l) x}{k-l} right]_{0}^{2 pi}end{aligned}The integral of the k-th term:begin{aligned}& a_{k} int_{0}^{2 pi} cos^2 k x , dx = frac{1}{2} a_{k} int_{0}^{2 pi} (cos 2 k x + 1) , dx = & = frac{1}{2} a_{k} left[ frac{sin 2 k x}{2 k} + x right]_{0}^{2 pi} = frac{1}{2} a_{k} cdot 2 pi = a_{k} pi neq 0end{aligned}Therefore,int_{0}^{2 pi} f(x) cos k x , dx = a_{k} pi neq 0which cannot hold if f(x), and hence f(x) cos k x, were zero for all x. This proves that if any a_{k} neq 0, then f(x) is not identically zero. Therefore, a_{1} cos x + a_{2} cos 2 x + ldots + a_{k} cos n x is zero for all x if and only if a_{1} = a_{2} = ldots = a_{n} = 0. In this case, the expression is indeed zero for all x.Judit Helyei (Pécs, Leöwey K. Gymnasium, 4th grade)Remark. In the first solution, we essentially proved the following: cos k x is a polynomial of cos x of degree exactly k. If a_{1} cos x + ldots + a_{n} cos n x = 0 for all x, then a_{1} cos x + ldots + a_{n-1} cos (n-1) x equiv -a_{n} cos n x. Here, the left-hand side is a polynomial of degree at most n-1, while the right-hand side is a polynomial of degree n in cos x if a_{n} neq 0, which is impossible since cos x takes infinitely many distinct values. This implies that a_{n} = 0."},{"problem":"To compare the sizes of two real numbers, a common method is to determine the sign of the difference between the two numbers.

Since q inleft[frac{1}{3}, 2right], it follows that q+frac{1}{q} inleft[2, frac{10}{3}right], and a b = x_{1}^{2} cdot q(1+q)left(1+q^{3}right) = frac{1+q+q^{3}+q^{4}}{q^{2}} = left(q^{2}+frac{1}{q^{2}}right) + left(q+frac{1}{q}right) = left(q+frac{1}{q}right)^{2} + left(q+frac{1}{q}right) - 2.

Also, the expression sqrt{1-x^2} often appears in trigonometry, for example in the relationship between the sine and the cosine. Both observations suggest that the formula may have a neat geometric interpretation.Consider the equation:[y = frac45 x + frac 35sqrt{1 - x^2}]Note that for t=sin^{-1} frac 35 we have sin t=frac 35 and cos t = frac 45. Now suppose that we have x=sin s for some s. Then our equation becomes:[y=cos t cdot sin s + sin t cdot |cos s|]Depending on the sign of cos s, this is either the angle addition, or the angle subtraction formula for sine. In other words, if cos s geq 0, then y=sin(s+t), otherwise y=sin(s-t).We have b_0=0=sin 0. Therefore b_1 = sin(0+t) = sin t, b_2 = sin(t+t) = sin (2t), and so on. (Remember that t is the constant defined as t=sin^{-1} frac 35.)This process stops at the first b_k = sin (kt), where kt exceeds frac{pi}2. Then we'll have b_{k+1} = sin(kt - t) = sin ((k-1)t) = b_{k-1} and the sequence will start to oscillate.Note that sin frac{pi}6 = frac 12  frac 35, hence t is strictly between frac{pi}6 and frac{pi}4. Then 2tinleft(frac{pi}3,frac{pi}2 right), and 3tinleft( frac{pi}2, frac{3pi}4 right). Therefore surely 2t < frac{pi}2 < 3t. Hence the process stops with b_3 = sin (3t), we then have b_4 = sin (2t) = b_2. As in the previous solution, we conclude that b_{10}=b_2, and that the answer is lfloor a_{10} rfloor  = leftlfloor 2^{10} b_{10} rightrfloor = boxed{983}."},{"problem":"5.3.

Similarly, it can be shown that the geometric mean of the numbers e_{i},sqrt[n]{e_{0} e_{1} ldots e_{n-1}}=frac{n}{sqrt[n]{n!}}also tends to e, so we get a good approximation of the value of n! by taking the n-th power of the ratio n / e. A more accurate estimate is given by the following inequality:left(frac{n}{e}right)^{n} sqrt{2 pi n} < n! < left(frac{n}{e}right)^{n} sqrt{2 pi n} cdot e^{1/(12n)}The exponential function a^x can be defined for all real x on the basis of the positive base a neq 1. For the base a=1, the function is constant, for a>1 it is monotonically increasing, and for a<1 it is monotonically decreasing. Based on the relationshipb^{x}=a^{x} log _{a} bit is sufficient to examine the function for a base, say a=e.The convergence of the sequence left(1+frac{1}{n}right)^{n} can be used to show that the derivative of the function e^{x} is itself, and thus the derivative of the logarithm with base e is 1 / x. The logarithm of the sequence examined in the problem is an approximate sum of the integral of the function (2 x-1) log x over the interval (0,1), and its limit can also be determined based on this."},{"problem":"13.

Therefore, we can assumen=3^m c, quad m geqslant 1, quad 3 nmid c.The second step is to prove that m=1. From n^2 mid (2^n + 1), we get 2^{3^m c} equiv -1 pmod{3^{2m}}, hence2^{2 times 3^m c} equiv 1 pmod{3^{2m}}.If m geqslant 2, then by Example 5 of Unit 8, the order of 2 modulo 3^{2m} is 2 times 3^{2m-1}, so from (2) we deduce that 2 times 3^{2m-1} mid 2 times 3^m c, i.e., 3^{m-1} mid c, thus 3 mid c (since m geqslant 2), which contradicts (1) where 3 nmid c. Therefore, we must have m=1.The third step is to prove that c=1 in (1). This can be done similarly to the first step, i.e., Example 1 of Unit 8: squareIf c>1, let q be the smallest prime divisor of c, then2^{3c} equiv -1 pmod{q}.Let r be the order of 2 modulo q. From (3), we get 2^{6c} equiv 1 pmod{q}, and also 2^{q-1} equiv 1 pmod{q}, so r mid 6c and r mid (q-1), hence r mid (6c, q-1). By the selection of q, we have (q-1, c)=1, so r mid 6. From 2^r equiv 1 pmod{q}, we deduce that q=3 or 7. It is easy to see that q=3 is impossible; and from (3), q=7 is also impossible. Therefore, we must have c=1. Thus, n=3.Note that if we first prove that c=1 in (1), it will not be effective. The order of the arguments here is quite important. Additionally, in the second step, m=1 can also be proven by comparing powers of primes:By the binomial theorem,2^n + 1 = (3-1)^n + 1 = 3n + sum_{k=2}^n (-1)^k binom{n}{k} 3^k.Let 3^a parallel k!, thenalpha = sum_{l=1}^{infty} left[frac{k}{3^l}right] k + m - frac{k}{2} geqslant m + 1.Thus, beta geqslant m + 2, so the sum on the right-hand side of (4) is divisible by 3^{m+2}. If m>1, then 2m geqslant m+2, so from 3^{2m} mid (2^n + 1) and (4), we get 3^{m+2} mid 3n, i.e., 3^{m+1} mid n, which contradicts (1). Therefore, we must have m=1."},{"problem":"39.

Since line l_2 is perpendicular to line l, their slopes are negative reciprocals of each other. As we found earlier, the slope of line l is -frac{3}{4}, hence the slope of line l_2 is frac{4}{3}.So, the equation of line l_2 can be written in the point-slope form as: y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), where m = frac{4}{3} and (x_1, y_1) = (1, 2). Substituting these values gives: y - 2 = frac{4}{3}(x - 1).Simplifying this equation yields: y = frac{4}{3}x - frac{2}{3}, or in the standard form: boxed{4x - 3y + 2 = 0}."},{"problem":"Given the complex number z = frac{2+i}{1-i}, the point corresponding to the complex number z on the complex plane is located in (　　)A: The first quadrantB: The second quadrantC: The third quadrantD: The fourth quadrant","solution":"To find the position of the complex number on the complex plane, we need to put the complex number into standard form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers.Let's start with the given complex number: z = frac{2+i}{1-i}.To eliminate the imaginary part from the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:z = frac{2+i}{1-i} cdot frac{1+i}{1+i}This simplifies as follows:[z =frac{(2+i)(1+i)}{(1-i)(1+i)}= frac{2 cdot 1 + 2i + i cdot 1 + i^2}{1 - i^2} = frac{2 + 2i + i - 1}{1 + 1} = frac{1 + 3i}{2}]Now, we have the complex number in the form a + bi, where a = frac{1}{2} and b = frac{3}{2}.

Thus, if one book is sold, the revenue is 5 yuan; if ten books are sold, the revenue is 50 yuan, and so on.

To find the total weight of the cans, we calculate:200g times 10 - 5g = 1995gSo, the total weight of these cans is 1995g, which is less than the standard total weight for 10 cans of 2000g.Therefore, the answer to part (1) is that the total weight is less than the standard, and the total weight is 1995g.boxed{1995g} Part 2: Maximum Difference in WeightTo find the maximum difference in weight between any two cans, we look for the cans with the maximum and minimum deviations since these will give the largest difference:The maximum deviation is +3g and the minimum deviation is -5g. The difference between these two values is:3g - (-5g) = 8gThus, the maximum difference in weight between any two cans is 8g.Therefore, the answer to part (2) is that the maximum difference in weight between any two cans is 8g.boxed{8g}This problem demonstrates the application of rational number addition and subtraction in solving real-life problems, emphasizing the importance of accurate calculation."},{"problem":"Four students, A, B, C, and D, have signed up for a community service activity during the holidays.

For example, 35+8=43,3+5+8=16,4+3=7,16-7=9. Carrying twice reduces the sum of the digits by 18, for example, 67+44=111,6+7+4+4=21,1+1+1=3,21-3=18. Similarly, carrying three times reduces the sum of the digits by 27. Because S(a)=S(2 a), it must involve a carry to meet the condition, and the carry will reduce by 9, 18, or 27. For example, 108+108=216, one carry reduces the sum of the digits by 9, and the two sums are equal. The required three-digit number must be a multiple of 9. Therefore, those that do not carry or carry too many times do not meet the condition.【Solution】Solution 1: Let a represent the three-digit number that meets the condition.0=S(2 a)-S(a) equiv S(2 a-a) equiv S(a) pmod{9},So a is a multiple of 9.

Three-digit numbers with a sum of 9 cannot have 2 digits greater than 4.(3) Three-digit numbers with a sum of 18 must have at least 2 digits greater than 4. As explained above, three-digit numbers with a sum of 18 and exactly 2 digits greater than 4 meet the condition. Three-digit numbers with a sum of 19 and exactly 3 digits greater than 4 are the sets:{x, y, z}, x leqslant y leqslant z .{x, y, z}={5,5,8} ;{5,6,7} ;{6,6,6} ;The set {5,5,8} can form 3 numbers, the set {5,6,7} can form 6 three-digit numbers, and the set {6,6,6} can form 1 three-digit number, totaling 10 numbers. These 10 three-digit numbers do not meet the condition.(4) The three-digit number with a sum of 27 is only 999, which meets the condition.In summary, among the 100 multiples of 9, 20 do not meet the condition, so there are 80 three-digit numbers that meet the condition.Solution 2: Among the three-digit numbers, every 100 numbers contain 10 multiples of 9. From 100 to 999, there are 100 multiples of 9. When S(a)=9, a carry is needed once to meet the condition. Three-digit numbers with all digits less than 5 do not carry and do not meet the condition:(2,3,4) combinations form 6 numbers, (1,4,4) combinations form 3 numbers, (3,3,3) form 1 number. When S(a)=18, a carry is needed twice to meet the condition. Three-digit numbers with all digits greater than 4 carry three times and do not meet the condition: (5,5,8) combinations form 3 numbers, (5,6,7) combinations form 6 numbers, (6,6,6) combinations form 1 number.

Case when m=0:   - If m=0, then the equation for set B becomes 0cdot x + 1 = 0, which has no solution for x.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to determine the maximum number of \\"good\\" pairs ((i, j)) where (1 leq i leq j leq 2n-1) and the number of blue numbers among (i, i+1, ldots, j) is odd.2. Constructing the Graph:   Let's construct a graph (G) with vertices labeled (1, 2, ldots, 2n-1). We will connect vertices (i) and (j) (where (i < j)) if the segment ([i, j]) contains an odd number of blue numbers.3. Graph Properties:   Observe that this graph is triangle-free. This is because if there were a triangle, say with vertices (a, b, c) (where (a < b < c)), then the segments ([a, b]), ([b, c]), and ([a, c]) would all need to have an odd number of blue numbers. However, the union of two segments with an odd number of blue numbers would result in an even number of blue numbers, contradicting the condition for the third segment.4. Applying Turán's Theorem:   Turán's theorem states that a triangle-free graph on (n) vertices has at most (leftlfloor frac{n^2}{4} rightrfloor) edges. In our case, the number of vertices is (2n-1), so the maximum number of edges is:   [   leftlfloor frac{(2n-1)^2}{4} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{4n^2 - 4n + 1}{4} rightrfloor = leftlfloor n^2 - n + frac{1}{4} rightrfloor = n^2 - n   ]5. Constructing the Optimal Coloring:   To achieve the maximum number of good pairs, we can color exactly (n) numbers blue. This ensures that every segment containing exactly one blue number is a good pair. The number of such segments is:   [   sum_{k=1}^{n} k = frac{n(n+1)}{2}   ]   However, this does not directly give us the maximum number of good pairs. Instead, we need to consider the total number of segments and ensure that the number of blue numbers is odd in as many segments as possible.6. Final Calculation:   By carefully choosing the positions of the blue numbers, we can ensure that the number of good pairs is maximized. The optimal configuration is to place (n) blue numbers such that each segment containing an odd number of blue numbers is counted. This results in:   [   n^2   ]   good pairs.Therefore, the maximum number of good pairs is (boxed{n^2})."},{"problem":"The slope of line l is 3, and it passes through point A(1, -2).

Simplify the equation:   Simplify the right-hand side:   [   n^alpha = 3 left(frac{2n}{3}right)^alpha = 3 left(frac{2^alpha n^alpha}{3^alpha}right) = 3 cdot frac{2^alpha}{3^alpha} cdot n^alpha   ]   [   n^alpha = 3 cdot left(frac{2}{3}right)^alpha cdot n^alpha   ]4. Isolate the term involving (alpha):   Divide both sides by ( n^alpha ):   [   1 = 3 cdot left(frac{2}{3}right)^alpha   ]5. Solve for (alpha):   [   1 = 3 cdot left(frac{2}{3}right)^alpha   ]   [   left(frac{2}{3}right)^alpha = frac{1}{3}   ]   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:   [   alpha lnleft(frac{2}{3}right) = lnleft(frac{1}{3}right)   ]   [   alpha lnleft(frac{2}{3}right) = -ln(3)   ]   [   alpha = frac{-ln(3)}{lnleft(frac{2}{3}right)}   ]   [   alpha = frac{ln(3)}{lnleft(frac{3}{2}right)}   ]6. Calculate ((243/32)^alpha):   [   (243/32)^alpha = left(frac{3^5}{2^5}right)^alpha = left(frac{3}{2}right)^{5alpha}   ]   Substitute (alpha):   [   left(frac{3}{2}right)^{5 cdot frac{ln(3)}{lnleft(frac{3}{2}right)}} = left(frac{3}{2}right)^{5 cdot frac{ln(3)}{ln(3) - ln(2)}}   ]   Simplify the exponent:   [   5 cdot frac{ln(3)}{ln(3) - ln(2)} = 5 cdot frac{ln(3)}{lnleft(frac{3}{2}right)}   ]   [   left(frac{3}{2}right)^{5 cdot frac{ln(3)}{lnleft(frac{3}{2}right)}} = 3^5 = 243   ]The final answer is (boxed{243})."},{"problem":"If X=1+x+x^2+x^3+cdots and Y=1+y+y^2+y^3+cdots, what is 1+xy+x^2y^2+x^3y^3+cdots in terms of X and Y only?","solution":"1. We start with the given series:   [   X = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + cdots   ]   and   [   Y = 1 + y + y^2 + y^3 + cdots   ]2. Recognize that these are geometric series. The sum of an infinite geometric series ( sum_{n=0}^{infty} ar^n ) is given by:   [   sum_{n=0}^{infty} ar^n = frac{a}{1-r}   ]   where ( a ) is the first term and ( r ) is the common ratio.3. For ( X ), the first term ( a = 1 ) and the common ratio ( r = x ). Therefore:   [   X = frac{1}{1-x}   ]4. Similarly, for ( Y ), the first term ( a = 1 ) and the common ratio ( r = y ). Therefore:   [   Y = frac{1}{1-y}   ]5. We need to find the sum ( 1 + xy + x^2y^2 + x^3y^3 + cdots ). This is also a geometric series with the first term ( a = 1 ) and the common ratio ( r = xy ). Therefore:   [   1 + xy + x^2y^2 + x^3y^3 + cdots = frac{1}{1-xy}   ]6. We now express ( x ) and ( y ) in terms of ( X ) and ( Y ):   [   X = frac{1}{1-x} implies 1 - x = frac{1}{X} implies x = 1 - frac{1}{X}   ]   [   Y = frac{1}{1-y} implies 1 - y = frac{1}{Y} implies y = 1 - frac{1}{Y}   ]7. Substitute ( x ) and ( y ) into the expression ( frac{1}{1-xy} ):   [   xy = left(1 - frac{1}{X}right)left(1 - frac{1}{Y}right)   ]8. Expand the product:   [   xy = 1 - frac{1}{X} - frac{1}{Y} + frac{1}{XY}   ]9. Substitute this back into the expression for the geometric series sum:   [   frac{1}{1-xy} = frac{1}{1 - left(1 - frac{1}{X} - frac{1}{Y} + frac{1}{XY}right)}   ]10. Simplify the denominator:    [    1 - xy = 1 - 1 + frac{1}{X} + frac{1}{Y} - frac{1}{XY} = frac{1}{X} + frac{1}{Y} - frac{1}{XY}    ]11. Therefore:    [    frac{1}{1-xy} = frac{1}{frac{1}{X} + frac{1}{Y} - frac{1}{XY}}    ]12. Simplify the fraction:    [    frac{1}{frac{1}{X} + frac{1}{Y} - frac{1}{XY}} = frac{XY}{X + Y - 1}    ]Thus, the sum ( 1 + xy + x^2y^2 + x^3y^3 + cdots ) in terms of ( X ) and ( Y ) is:[boxed{frac{XY}{X+Y-1}}]"},{"problem":"In a trapezoid, the length of the midline is 10cm, and one diagonal divides the midline such that the difference between the two parts is 3cm.

From the properties of the trapezoid, we know that the length of the midline is the average of the two bases, which gives us our first equation: frac{x+y}{2} = 10 The diagonal divides the midline into two segments. Since the problem states that the difference in length between these two segments is 3cm, the longer segment corresponds to half the difference in lengths of the two bases plus half the length of the shorter base, while the shorter segment corresponds to half the length of the shorter base minus half the difference in lengths of the two bases. Hence, the second equation based on the difference of these two segments is: (frac{y}{2} + frac{x-y}{2}) - (frac{y}{2} - frac{x-y}{2}) = 3 Simplify the second equation: x - y = 6 Now we have a system of two equations:begin{align*}frac{x+y}{2} &= 10 x - y &= 6end{align*}Solve the first equation for y: y = 20 - x Substitute y into the second equation: x - (20 - x) = 6 Solve for x:begin{align*}2x - 20 &= 6 2x &= 26 x &= 13end{align*}So the final length of the larger base is (boxed{13text{cm}})."},{"problem":"An island has 10 cities, where some of the possible pairs of cities are connected by roads. A [i]tour route[/i] is a route starting from a city, passing exactly eight out of the other nine cities exactly once each, and returning to the starting city. (In other words, it is a loop that passes only nine cities instead of all ten cities.) For each city, there exists a tour route that doesn't pass the given city. Find the minimum number of roads on the island.","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   - We have 10 cities, and some pairs of cities are connected by roads.   - A tour route is a loop that starts from a city, passes exactly 8 out of the other 9 cities exactly once each, and returns to the starting city.   - For each city, there exists a tour route that doesn't pass through the given city.   - We need to find the minimum number of roads on the island.2. Graph Representation:   - Represent the cities as vertices of a graph ( G ) with 10 vertices.   - The roads are the edges of the graph.   - A tour route corresponds to a 9-cycle in the graph that excludes one specific vertex.3. Degree Condition:   - For each vertex ( v ), there must be a 9-cycle that excludes ( v ).   - If a vertex ( v ) has a degree less than 3, it cannot be part of a 9-cycle excluding ( v ) because it would not have enough connections to form such a cycle.   - Therefore, each vertex must have a degree of at least 3.4. Minimum Number of Edges:   - Let ( d(v) ) denote the degree of vertex ( v ).   - By the Handshaking Lemma, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is twice the number of edges: (sum_{v in V} d(v) = 2|E|).   - Since each vertex has a degree of at least 3, we have (sum_{v in V} d(v) geq 3 times 10 = 30).   - Thus, (2|E| geq 30), which implies (|E| geq 15).5. Construction of a Graph with 15 Edges:   - We need to construct a graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges where each vertex has a degree of exactly 3.   - One possible construction is to use a 10-cycle and add 5 additional edges to ensure each vertex has a degree of 3.6. Verification of the Construction:   - Consider the vertices labeled ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_{10} ).   - Connect the vertices in a cycle: ( v_1 - v_2 - v_3 - ldots - v_{10} - v_1 ).   - Add the following edges: ( v_1 - v_6, v_2 - v_7, v_3 - v_8, v_4 - v_9, v_5 - v_{10} ).   - Each vertex now has a degree of 3, and the total number of edges is 15.7. Ensuring the Existence of 9-Cycles:   - For each vertex ( v_i ), removing ( v_i ) leaves a subgraph with 9 vertices and 14 edges.   - This subgraph is connected and has enough edges to form a 9-cycle, ensuring that the condition of the problem is satisfied.[boxed{15}]"},{"problem":"Find the minimum value of the function y = x^2 - x on the interval [0, 1].","solution":"The function y = x^2 - x opens upwards and has a symmetry axis at x = frac{1}{2}.

We can pair residues as follows:   [   (0), (1, 2008), (2, 2007), ldots, (1004, 1005)   ]   This gives us ( 1005 ) pairs plus the single residue ( 0 ).4. Pigeonhole Principle:   If we select ( 1006 ) integers, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one of these pairs must be chosen twice. This is because there are only ( 1005 ) pairs, and we are selecting ( 1006 ) integers. 5. Sum or difference condition:   If two integers ( a ) and ( b ) are chosen from the same pair, then either:   [   a + b equiv 0 pmod{2009} quad text{or} quad a - b equiv 0 pmod{2009}   ]   This satisfies the condition that their sum or difference is divisible by ( 2009 ).6. Verification for ( n = 1005 ):   If we select ( 1005 ) integers, it is possible to choose one integer from each pair without repeating any pair. For example, selecting ( {0, 1, 2, ldots, 1004} ) ensures that no two selected integers have a sum or difference divisible by ( 2009 ).7. Conclusion:   Therefore, the smallest positive integer ( n ) such that for any selection of ( n ) integers, there exist at least two whose sum or difference is divisible by ( 2009 ) is ( 1006 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 1006 } )"},{"problem":"31. frac{1^{2}-2^{2}+3^{2}-4^{2}+5^{2}-6^{2}+7^{2}-8^{2}+9^{2}-10^{2}}{2^{0}+2^{1}+2^{2}+2^{3}+2^{4}+2^{5}+2^{6}+2^{7}} 的值是The value of frac{1^{2}-2^{2}+3^{2}-4^{2}+5^{2}-6^{2}+7^{2}-8^{2}+9^{2}-10^{2}}{2^{0}+2^{1}+2^{2}+2^{3}+2^{4}+2^{5}+2^{6}+2^{7}} is","solution":"Reference answer: -11 / 51"},{"problem":"Let w = dfrac{sqrt{3} + i}{2} and z = dfrac{-1 + isqrt{3}}{2}, where i = sqrt{-1}.

If varepsilon_i = 1, then the considered sequence has its i-th term equal to 1, and thus belongs to A_i^{varepsilon_i} = A_i^1; if, on the other hand, varepsilon_i = -1, then the considered sequence has its i-th term equal to -1, and thus belongs to X - A_i = A_i^{-1}. Therefore, the set A_1^{varepsilon_1} cap A_2^{varepsilon_2} cap ldots cap A_n^{varepsilon_n} contains the sequence (varepsilon_1, varepsilon_2, ldots, varepsilon_n), and thus is non-empty.We will now show that if r > n and B_1, B_2, ldots, B_r are some subsets of the set X, then they are not mutually independent. If the sequences (varepsilon_1, varepsilon_2, ldots, varepsilon_r) and (varepsilon with values -1 and 1 are different, then the setsare disjoint. Specifically, if, for example, varepsilon_i = 1, then we have B subset B_i^{varepsilon_i} = B_i and B subset X - B_i, and the sets B_i and X - B_i are obviously disjoint.Thus, if the sets B_1, B_2, ldots, B_r were mutually independent, then all sets of the form B_1^{varepsilon_1} cap B_2^{varepsilon_2} cap ldots cap B_r^{varepsilon_r} would be non-empty and pairwise disjoint. There are 2^r > 2^n such sets. This is impossible, since the set X contains only 2^n elements.We have thus proved that n is the maximum number of mutually independent subsets of a 2^n-element set."},{"problem":"Calculate: C_3^0+C_4^1+C_5^2+⋯+C_{10}^7=____.

We will convert the common fraction frac{34}{275} to a decimal. For this, we will perform long division (fig.). As a result, we find frac{34}{275}=0.123636363 ldots=0.123(63). We obtain the non-repeating part 123 and the repeating part 63. Let's discuss why the non-repeating part appears here, and show that the fraction frac{1}{221} does not have a non-repeating part. The matter is that in the decimal representation of the fraction frac{34}{275}, the digit 3 appears every time the remainder is 100 when dividing by 275. We see (and this is the key point!), that the same remainder 100 is given by different numbers: 650 and 1750. Where, in turn, did these 650 and 1750 come from? The number 650 was obtained by appending a zero to the number r_{1}=65 (the remainder from dividing 340 by 275). That is, 10 r_{1}=650. Similarly, 10 r_{2}=1750, where r_{2}=175. The numbers 650 and 1750 give the same remainder when divided by 275 because their difference is divisible by 275: 1750-650=10left(r_{2}-r_{1}right): 275. This is possible only because the numbers 10 and 275 are not coprime. Now it is clear why the fraction frac{1}{221} does not have a non-repeating part: if r_{1} and r_{2} are different remainders from dividing by 221, then the product 10left(r_{2}-r_{1}right) is not divisible by 221 (the number 221, unlike 275, is coprime with 10 - the base of the number system, so there is no non-repeating part).Thus, the decimal representation of the fraction frac{1}{221} has the form frac{1}{221}=0,left(a_{1} a_{2} ldots a_{n}right).

From this, A=frac{10^{n}-1}{221}. Since A is a natural number, we need to find (the smallest) natural n for which the number 10^{n} gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 221.Note that 221=13 cdot 17. In general, an integer B (in our case B=10^{n}) gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 221 if and only if B gives a remainder of 1 when divided by both 13 and 17. The necessity is obvious. Sufficiency: if B=13 k_{1}+1 and B=17 k_{2}+1, then 13 k_{1}=17 k_{2}, which means that k_{1} is divisible by 17, i.e., k_{1}=17 m. Therefore, B=13 cdot 17 m+1, and when divided by 221, the remainder is indeed 1. Now let's find such n that the number 10^{n} gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 13. Consider the sequence b_{n}=10^{n}. Replace its terms with remainders when divided by 13. We get this: b_{1}=10, b_{2}=9, b_{3}=13, b_{4}=3, b_{5}=4, b_{6}=1, ldots Each subsequent term is uniquely determined by the previous one. Therefore, left{b_{n}right} is a periodic sequence, where every sixth term is 1. We will do the same for 17. There, 1 will be equal to every 16th term.

Indeed, if a square with 26 points does not exist then the points are at most 83.24=19922000. Further, move the square with more than 25 points towards the square with less that 25 points. Since the number of points in this square changes at most by one we get the assertion of the problem.To prove b) let x_{1}=0, x_{i}=x_{i-1}+frac{83}{1999} and y_{i}=0 for i= 0,2,4, ldots, 2000 while y_{i}=1 for i=1,3, ldots, 1999. Let X Y Z T be an unit square. WLOG we assume that it intersects the linesy=0 and y=1 in the points P, Q and R, S respectively. ThenP Q+Q R+R S+S P<P Y+Y Q+Q Z+Z R+R T+T S+S X+X P=4But S P, Q R geq 1 and we get P Q+R S<2. This implies that in the square X Y Z T there are no more than 25 points.We found that n=25 is a solution of the problem. It is unique since 24<frac{2000}{83}<25."},{"problem":"5.

Existence of Minima:   To determine if the function ( f(x) = sum_{k=1}^{m}(x-k)^{4} ) has a minimum, we first compute the second derivative ( f''(x) ).

Therefore, ( f(x) ) is strictly convex, implying that ( f(x) ) has a unique minimum.2. Uniqueness of Minima:   Since ( f''(x) > 0 ) for all ( x in mathbb{R} ), ( f(x) ) is strictly convex. A strictly convex function has at most one critical point, and this critical point is where the minimum occurs. Thus, ( f(x) ) has a unique minimum.3.

The parameter of the parabola is p, which measures the distance from the focus to the directrix. In our case, y=x^{2}, i.e., frac{1}{2 p}=1, p=frac{1}{2}, and the coordinates of the focus are Fleft(0 ; frac{1}{4}right). Let E be a point of tangency (we will only consider tangents in the first quadrant for now), with coordinates left(x_{0} ; x_{0}^{2}right). We seek the equation of the tangent e that forms a 45^{circ} angle with the line E F.First, let's write the equation of the line E F. A direction vector of E F has coordinates V left(x_{0} ; x_{0}^{2}-frac{1}{4}right); a point on the line has coordinates Fleft(0 ; frac{1}{4}right), so the equation of E F is:y=frac{x_{0}^{2}-frac{1}{4}}{x_{0}} x+frac{1}{4}It is known that the general equation of the tangent to a parabola is:x x_{0}=pleft(y+y_{0}right)where x_{0}, y_{0} are the coordinates of the point of tangency and p is the parameter.In our case, p=frac{1}{2}, so the equation of the tangent is: x x_{0}=frac{1}{2}left(y+x_{0}^{2}right).

Thus, the coordinates of the point of tangency are left(frac{1}{2} ; frac{1}{4}right) in the first quadrant; and left(-frac{1}{2} ; frac{1}{4}right) in the second quadrant. Substituting these values into (1), the equations of the two tangents are: y=x-frac{1}{4}, and y=-x-frac{1}{4}.Note. The problem can also be solved differently, for example, by determining the coordinates of the intersection point T of the tangent e and the x-axis, and applying the cosine rule to the triangle F E T, from which the value of x_{0} can be calculated.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_2b06091fd7d1dd6d32dcg-1.jpg?height=599&width=461&top_left_y=2091&top_left_x=821)"},{"problem":"## Task ConditionCalculate the areas of figures bounded by lines given in polar coordinates.r=sin phi, r=2 sin phi","solution":"## SolutionS=frac{1}{2} int_{alpha}^{beta}left(r_{1}^{2}(varphi)-r_{2}^{2}(varphi)right) d varphiWhere alpha=-frac{pi}{2} ; beta=frac{pi}{2}, and then we get:begin{aligned}& S=frac{1}{2} int_{-pi / 2}^{pi / 2}left(4 sin ^{2} varphi-sin ^{2} varphiright) d varphi= & =frac{3}{2} int_{-pi / 2}^{pi / 2} sin ^{2} varphi d varphi= & =frac{3}{2} int_{-pi / 2}^{pi / 2} frac{1-cos 2 varphi}{2} d varphi= & =left.frac{3}{4}left(varphi-frac{sin 2 varphi}{2}right)right|_{-pi / 2} ^{pi / 2}= & =frac{3}{4}left(frac{pi}{2}-frac{1}{2} sin piright)-frac{3}{4}left(-frac{pi}{2}-frac{1}{2} sin (-pi)right)= & =frac{3}{4} cdot frac{pi}{2}+frac{3}{4} cdot frac{pi}{2}=frac{3}{4} cdot piend{aligned}Source — \\"http://pluspi.org/wiki/index.php/%D0%9A%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%BE%D0%B2_%D0%98%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8B_16-16%\\"- Last edited on this page: 12:52, 9 July 2010.- Content is available under CC-BY-SA 3.0.## Problem Kuznetsov Integrals 16-17## Material from PlusPi"},{"problem":"Calculate  (1)(2sqrt{3}-1)^{2}+(sqrt{3}+2)(sqrt{3}-2)  (2)(sqrt{6}-2sqrt{15})times sqrt{3}-6sqrt{frac{1}{2}}.","solution":" Problem 1:Calculate  (1)(2sqrt{3}-1)^{2}+(sqrt{3}+2)(sqrt{3}-2)  (2)(sqrt{6}-2sqrt{15})times sqrt{3}-6sqrt{frac{1}{2}}.

In this scenario, the sides of the triangle would be 4, 4, and 9. - To check if these sides can form a triangle, we apply the triangle inequality theorem:  - For the two sides of length 4 and the third side of length 9, we see that 4 + 4 = 8 which is not greater than 9. This means that these side lengths violate the triangle inequality theorem, and thus, cannot form a triangle.Step 2: Consider the case where the base is 9. In this scenario, the sides of the triangle would be 4, 9, and 9.- Applying the triangle inequality theorem again:  - For the two sides of length 9 and the third side of length 4, we see that 9 + 9 = 18 which is greater than 4. This means that these side lengths satisfy the triangle inequality theorem and can form a triangle.Step 3: Calculate the perimeter of the triangle with sides 4, 9, and 9.- The perimeter P of a triangle is the sum of its side lengths.

The segments A_{1} B, C_{1} B, C_{1} A, B_{1} A, B_{1} C, A_{1} C are all of unit length, somathbf{a}+mathbf{c}=overrightarrow{P B}, quad mathbf{a}+mathbf{b}=overrightarrow{P C}, quad mathbf{b}+mathbf{c}=overrightarrow{P A}The vector pointing to the midpoint of the segment A A_{1} is:frac{overrightarrow{P A_{1}}+overrightarrow{P A}}{2}=frac{mathbf{a}+mathbf{b}+mathbf{c}}{2}We get the same vector for the midpoints of B B_{1} and C C_{1}, so the three midpoints indeed coincide. The reflection of the triangle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} about O is the triangle A B C. Since a unit circle can be circumscribed around the triangle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} with center P, the same can be done for the triangle A B C.Based on the work of Stomfai Gergely (Budapest, ELTE Apáczai Cs. J. Gyakorló Gimn. és Koll., 10th grade)Note. It can be seen from the solution that the point O is the center of the Feuerbach circle of the triangle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}, the point P is the center of the circumcircle, and the reflection of the point P about O is the orthocenter of the triangle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}, which, as we learned, is the center of the circumcircle of the triangle A B C. This can also be stated as follows: the pedal triangle D E F of the triangle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} was dilated by a factor of two from the center P of the circumcircle, resulting in the triangle A B C."},{"problem":"A box contains 36 pink, 18 blue, 9 green, 6 red, and 3 purple cubes that are identical in size.

We are given two conditions:1. Purchasing 2 units of type A and 3 units of type B costs a total of 690 yuan.2. Purchasing 1 unit of type A and 4 units of type B costs a total of 720 yuan.These conditions can be represented by the system of equations:[begin{align*}2x + 3y &= 690 x + 4y &= 720end{align*}]To solve for x and y, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we'll use elimination:- Multiply the second equation by 2 to align the coefficients of x:[begin{align*}2x + 3y &= 690 2x + 8y &= 1440end{align*}]- Subtract the first equation from the modified second equation to eliminate x:[begin{align*}(2x + 8y) - (2x + 3y) &= 1440 - 690 5y &= 750 y &= 150end{align*}]- Substitute y = 150 into the first equation to solve for x:[begin{align*}2x + 3(150) &= 690 2x + 450 &= 690 2x &= 240 x &= 120end{align*}]Therefore, the price per unit of type A is 120 yuan and the price per unit of type B is 150 yuan.

The total cost does not exceed 5400 yuan: 120m + 150(40 - m) leq 5400.Solving the inequalities:- For the first condition:[begin{align*}m &leq 3(40 - m) m &leq 120 - 3m 4m &leq 120 m &leq 30end{align*}]- For the second condition:[begin{align*}120m + 150(40 - m) &leq 5400 120m + 6000 - 150m &leq 5400 -30m &leq -600 m &geq 20end{align*}]Combining both conditions, we find that the range of the number of units of type A to be purchased is 20 leq m leq 30.

This probability is also given by the formula for the probability of a tie in a large number of games, which is ( frac{1}{11} ).3. The probability of a tie in total wins after ( 2k ) games is given by:   [   binom{2k}{k} n^k (1-n)^k   ]   where ( binom{2k}{k} ) is the binomial coefficient representing the number of ways to choose ( k ) wins out of ( 2k ) games.4.

Assume that some k vertices (0 leqq k leqq 66) of a regular 66-gon are assigned the number 1, and the remaining 66-k vertices are assigned the number -1.
