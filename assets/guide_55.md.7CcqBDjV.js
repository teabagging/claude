My gums have become a lot more sensitive since my pregnancy.","Doctor":"Hi. Welcome to Healthcaremagic.I read your query. During pregnancy, hormonal changes makes gums and teeth more prone to plaque. This is called Pregnancy gingivitis. Best care is to maintain good oral hygiene. Brush twice daily. Ask your dentist about correct brushing method. Use non alchoholic mouthwash or do warm saline rinses.

You have got a lower abdominal pain that travels across the abdomen and becomes sharp on standing up after sitting for a long time. Thinking of Psoas muscle.Yes , this is a possibility and a clinical examination of a Psoas test will confirm or rule out the diagnosis.

Another possibilities are :HerniaMuscular strain and sprains of the anterior abdominal wall.

Also, my right ear is staying hot and is very sore.","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for your query.Directly following wisdom tooth extraction, there may even be difficulty swallowing, so it is best to consume liquids, including water, energy drinks, juices, smoothies, and shakes, etc. In all phases of recovery, it is important to stay well-hydrated, so be sure to drink roughly five to eight glasses of these liquids per day.When you feel ready to eat solid foods, it is best to begin with softer things like heavier smoothies, soups, pudding, gelatin, and yogurt. When the pain and discomfort of chewing has lessened more, you may be able to eat soft breads, eggs, and thicker, more hearty soups. Pureed foods are also a great option at this point because they are so easy to eat. These include applesauce, mashed potatoes and gravy, cottage cheese, and hummus.There are also things to avoid in your diet following wisdom tooth removal, especially during the day directly after extraction. To avoid aggravating the pain and soreness, tough or chewy foods should not be consumed. Any foods with small grains or seeds should be avoided, as these grains and seeds can easily become lodged in the tooth removal site, causing irritation.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"Had a wisdom removed Monday.

IBD is different than IBS but similiar, IBD can only be determined by a colonoscopy. I am only 19 years old I am also a female and I have experienced pain similar to this.

Turns out your gall bladder is located on the upper right side of your stomach and your pancreas is located in the center of your upper stomach which can feel like pain in your chest. Both of which could all hurt your abdomin intensely if you have gallstones. Gallstones can cause pancreatitis, which in a nutshell is swelling of your pancreas.

She is only four years old. I knew it wasn't god when I brought her in. She has experienced no pain what so ever. I know it was my fault from lack of care but it is my job to make her feel the most comfortable as possible. Her molar on her right side is bothering her gums because it is infected and is starting to puss. She was prescribed amoxicillin. They scheduled four separate appointments to do the dental work. The appointments seem fairly close together. I don't believe it is enough time for her to recover before going back. I had asked for her to be put to sleep when the teeth were pulled and the dentist told me she recommended her to be on laughing gas because she was very cooperative.

Do you think I should demand her to be put to sleep?","Doctor":"Hello, thank you for consulting with healthcaremagic. As you are mentioning that your daughter molar teeth are infected, and even there is pus discharge , then you should get them removed as these are milk teeth not permanent and if you will leave them they will infect the erupting permanent tooth also.These capping which the dentist has mentioned will maintain the space for permanent teeth,  so they are necessary.

If the tooth is having decay, or fracture pain can be due to that.A x ray can rule any abnormality. Dologel can help if there is any ulceration or soreness in the gums.It acts as a topical anesthetic agent thus numbing the sensation and reducing pain. You can apply it 2 to 3 times a day with your finger on the affected area. I would suggest that if the pain is not coming down or worsens go back to your dentist and get a thorough examination done.

Thank you."},{"Patient":"Hello, I recently had a root canal done. During the procedure, my dentist would repeatedly remove the drill from my mouth and place the drill bit into a blue box that contained several holes. He would read off a measurement to his assistant and then return the drill/drill bit into my tooth and drill more. The blue box looked old/worn. I now have several sores in my mouth and am paranoid that it is the result of his putting the drill bit ito the box where all other root canal measurements are made and then back into my mouth. I am scared about the procedure not being sterile and getting disease from this. Is this something that should be reported? Should I switch dentists?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome.Thanks for sharing your concern.Please note that if you are paronoid or curious to know if the instruments being used are sterilized or not then please feel free to ask.It is your right to know if the treatment offered is aseptic or not.Therefore rather than changing the dentist please talk about your problem and ask them to use a new set of kit for you.Hope it helps.Thanks.Take caretake care."},{"Patient":"I went to the dentist a few months ago to get a retainer (the clear plastic one) and it creates big ulcers so bad that i cant put it back in.

If a certain medication is the cause, stopping or changing your medicine may help eliminate the problem. (Do not stop taking your medications unless directed by your doctor, however.) Some people, notably those with respiratory infections or allergies, regain their sense of taste when these conditions are resolved. Often, the correction of a general medical problem also can correct the loss of taste. Occasionally, a person may recover his or her sense of taste spontaneously.

To get relief from pain you are adviced to do-1) Add 1 tbs of salt in warm water and gargle with it thrice a day,this will definitely give some relief. you can use alcohol free mouth wash also.2)if you smokes then stop smoking until the wound heals because smoking causes unbearable pain in such situations.The extraction site has to be cleaned and dressed with medicated pack for that you have to go to your dentist becaue mere above steps are not sufficient to reduce the pain. your dentist would prescribe antibiotics and pain killers which would help in healing of wound.I hope you get well soon.

I needed an emergency appointment because the gum had grown over my tooth by Saturday. The referred dentist broke the remainder of my tooth off when placing a dental dam on it. After two more try's, he was able to secure the dam on my capped tooth beside the afflicted area. Is it common for a dam to break a tooth like this? Shouldn't the surgeon have known the structure of the tooth when he examined it three days prior? I am really concerned that this refered dentist accidentally did something wrong. I will not dispute or disrespect the service because I am grateful for it, but I would like to know if something was done with poor judgement, just for my own knowledge.

So try to make regular and thorough teeth cleaning part of your routine. Ask your dentist or dental hygienist about the best ways to clean your teeth and the best brushes and toothpastes to use.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"my dentist prescribed me to take two 500 mg of amoxicillin on my first dosage and the one every six hours.

The reason is that the ear, nose, throat and teeth are intimately connected. In this setting the nerves which deliver sensation and pain to the teeth are disturbed and inflamed.

Bad breath is also called halitosis and many a reasons from acid reflux to dental hygiene can be the reason. Unless there is an etiology connected here with this symptom all i can advise is a good oral hygiene most of which you are already practicing. Flossing, brushing, tongue brushing, tongue scraping, and chewing gums will help.The tongue should be brushed in a gentle but thorough manner, in a posterior to anterior direction, keeping in mind that the least accessible posterior portion smells the worst. Keep hydration status checked as it worsens when the mouth dries out (eg, at night, while fasting).Mouth washes, garlic water mouth rinses would help.

There's no redness, whiteness, swelling or anything else I can see. It doesn't hurt as long as my tongue doesn't move or put pressure on it. Its on the roof of my mouth, near the gums of my very back molars. It's a sharp pain. It feels kind of like like how you'd imagine rubbing sand on a rug-burn would hurt. It gets worse throughout the day, probably because of the friction of my tongue on it. Any ideas?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for your query.The roof of the mouth is divided into two major parts. The hard palate is a bony area in the anterior region of the mouth. Behind it, towards the back of the mouth, is the fleshy soft palate, which lacks a bony plate. Pain in this area may be due to a number of issues. A burning sensation on the palate along with the tongue and cheeks may be burning mouth syndrome, a chronic condition that does not have a clear cause.Discomfort accompanied by open sores may be canker sores or herpes.Effective treatment depends on the cause of palatal pain. Non-viral infections can be treated with antibiotics or, in the case of thrush, antifungal medication. The cause of burning mouth syndrome is unknown, so the best course of action is determined on a case by case basis. Canker sores, herpes and mild inflammation due to irritation usually resolve themselves on their own, but antiseptic mouth rinses can help with symptoms. Whatever the issue may be, it is best assessed by a doctor who can give a diagnosis and a plan of action for treatment.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"Hello dr, I've fainted after wisdom tooth extractions, 2 extraction about two years apart and on both occasions I fainted and collapsed in the reception after the painless procedure.

When implants no longer fit properly, excessive pressure may impact the gums and bone below the implant resulting in sinus pressure. If the biting surfaces have worn down as well, then headaches may result. Any type of pain or pressure should be evaluated by your dentist or prosthodontist to ensure the tissues are healthy.

It is sore to the touch.I'm an ex smoker so scared of the worst.What do you recommend?Thanks","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for your query.But first let me address what that hard lump is..... since it is not draining, it is most likely a cyst that has formed in the bone and grown into the hard tissue. This is seen frequently with root canaled teeth because it is caused by the bacteria that has been residing in your root canaled tooth. Not just from the \\"missed canal\\", but from the microscopic canals that cannot be cleaned out. So the re treatment may have removed some dead nerve material from the missed canal, but it did nothing to access the microscopic ones. Therefore, the tooth will continue to be infected. An apicoectomy is a surgical root canal, it accomplishes the same thing that a re treatment does with the exception that the surgeon physically goes in and removes the cyst.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"I had a whits spot  nudre my tongue it was hurting then stoped after a few daysnd went away then it was on my gums lower lip it hurt to eat after 3 days it no longer hurts however my lip andd gums are separating I no longer have my lower lip connection with each day it gets deeper and deeper???

I was wondering if it is possible that I Remove 3 wisdom teeth along with the lower 28, then got braces to move over my other teeth and make room for my wisdom tooth (on the lower right not coming in compacted) to come in and act as a molar. If this is possible I would rather do this than have a false tooth in my jaw. I ask online because I dont want any bias from my dentist or the surgeon.","Doctor":"Hello, thank you for consulting with healthcaremagic. Yes it is possible to get extracted all wisdom tooth but it should not be done on the same appointment. But if the dentist is mentioning that 28 needs to be extracted then  there must be some infection left in the apical region of tooth which will create problem in the future.Better you should go with the dentist as he must have diagnosed all the conditions.

Medications can reduce the duration and frequency of herpes outbreaks. They can also help reduce the risk of HSV type 1 transmission to a susceptible partner.

There's no bleeding at all, no pain at all (I didn't even feel pain after the extraction...none whatsoever fortunately) and I feel pretty much normal...been rinsing with slighty warm water with salt and the dentists told me to apply Clorohexidine LACER gel on the socket.Since the clot fell off, am I at risk of dry socket?I'm also a smoker and haven't smoked anything in week and a half, since the abcess began developing.

It caused the left side of my face to swell. I saw an oral surgeon who gave me antibiotics to clear it up until I could get an appointment to get them removed. The swelling went away but also at this time I noticed my lymph nodes under the left side of my jaw were larger than the other side. They cause no pain but you can definitely tell a difference. I read that that sometimes occurs with wisdom teeth infections. A week or two later I had all four wisdom teeth removed and everything went fine. I didn't take the recovery seriously due to the fact I only took my antibiotics for a week until the pain went away instead of finishing out the bottle.

Can such tooth pastes can be used over a prolonged period of time?","Doctor":"Hello,Choosing a desensitizing tooth paste depend on your degree of tooth wearing and the amount of sensitivity. You should start with a very basic one like plain sensodent , apply for 10-15 minutes, do it for two times daily for at least 1 week. If you did not  feel relief from that then you should visit your dentist as he will examine the tooth and then prescribe you what is needed, as without proper examination just experimenting with anything is not done.Hope it will help youThank you"},{"Patient":"My teeth are suddenly breaking.

This was 10 days ago. I have only taken four of the motrin, as I don't really feel how they help with any pain. Instead I finished off a bottle of Tylenol 3 that had been previously prescribed by my dentist for different extraction. Not sure why I was prescribed two different pain killers, but it is a father/son denistry and both did extractions on me. The most recent one was difficult and after two follow up visits, it is healing fine, but I was told to finish off the penicillin, which I did today. So I have taken penicillin for 10 days, stopping today. I have also occassionally taken an Advil PM to sleep when the pain killers didn't work during the worst of my tooth pain. Yesterday, after not having eaten this in months, I made a bad choice and had a McDonalds cheeseburger. It usually upsets my stomach and that is certainly what happened, as I was up at early hours of the morning in the toilet. Finally it turned diarrheal, which is always a sign for me that the worst of my digestive issue is over for that episode. However, it has lingered throughout the day. Finally, I had another bowel movement around noon or so and it had no smell, seemed to have some blood in it and it was dark and sort of shredded in texture. My stomach pain is still lingering. I learned antibiotics can wipe out good bacteria that helps with digestion and so I've been eating yogurt with a lot of cultures since that fearful bowel movement. I know I need to see my doctor, but from the sound of it, does this sound terribly serious?  I also have to take iron for anemia, but I'm very slack on that every week. I take a women's multivitamin daily and for the past few days I've drank a smooth of kale, strawberries, cucumbers, yogurt, and almond milk which has helped my bowel movements. I have a history of constipation but it has gotten a bit better with me incorporating better foods and cutting down on fast food. I don't exercise at all, which I know is a huge factor. I have also tried maca root twice this week, just a single capsule on two separate days and felt no effects. I did this after researching a natural way to gain some energy. I work from home, so again, not very active these past few years, but I plan to definitely change that. I don't drink quite enough water according to my doctor, but do not drink much of any other liquids either, mostly just bottled water and ginger ale. I have a history with what I believed to be gluten-intolerence where eating things I'd always eaten, like oatmeal and Nutri-grain bars, would break my skin out, actually peeling away a top layer of skin in circle-shaped break-outs. I have not seen one of those on my skin in years, but still stay away from certain what products while I've began to eat others that I had shied away from, like granola cereal.  Overall, eating red meat isn't that common for me. I eat little meat generally, mostly chicken, fish, and the occasional bacon. That is pretty much all of my health history and lifestyle.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome Thanks for consulting HCM,  as u mentioned that you have undergone extraction and you have taken good amount of antibiotics as you have constipation problem also I will suggest that you dont worry about that take a course of vitamin B complex for one week twice daily it will help you and if problem continues then consult physician."},{"Patient":"dental question.

The head injury would have caused a hematoma or edema, which may be the cause of pain. Use an ice pack on the injured area. Watch out for any loss of consciousness, vomiting or severe head ache, and if so, consult a surgeon immediately. A CT scan may have to be taken then, to rule out any intra cranial injury."},{"Patient":"Hello. I am in generally good health and today I was told by my dentist that I may suffer from TMJ, after a week of discomfort in my jaw. I have no throat or ear infections, and my only discomfort is in my jaw.

The only similarity is the jaw pain in both. However, the pain in TMJ can be provoked during eating or talking while the pain in heart problems can only be felt there but not provoked. I think there are really no reasons to get too worried about heart disease as you have not reported any concerning symptoms about that.I hope this addresses your query fully.

The first is that, in the process of filling the space normally taken up by your tooth pulp, the dentist has used too much filling material. Doing this sometimes results in the material penetrating to the main sensory nerve and chemically burning it. It is very common for overfill in rear teeth to cause lip and chin numbness.

This condition is very common. In dental terminology we call it as crowding or malaligned teeth. This condition can be definitely corrected with orthodontic treatmentDepending on the severity of the condition, your age and your oral health, there are various options available in orthodontic treatment.- The first option is to go for conventional orthodontic treatment (Braces). This may take about 1-3 years depending on the severity and age. The dentist may or may not extract few of your teeth to gain space so that the front teeth can be aligned. - The second option is to ask for invisalign, where there are no braces, but a series of appliances will be given to you. The appliance would be transparent and hence it would be aesthetically pleasing, nobody would get to know that you are being treated.- If the crowding is minor and if the teeth have to be moved very little to align, then the dentist may recommend removable appliance. However there are more chances of recurrence if the condition is treated with removable appliance. Hope I have answered your queries.

Got worse recently. I tried reading on the internet all I can about this problem, and still cannot identify the reason and possible answer as to what I can do to solve this problem.","Doctor":"HelloThe metallic taste that you have in your mouth can be associated with a variety of factors that can range from cancer, allergies to diseases such as kidney failure, pregnancy, dental problems, deficiency in certain vitamins, and more. Disorders of the nervous system can also cause you to have an altered sense of taste. Nervous system disorders affect how your nerves send messages to the rest of your body.How to treat this?1. Most often, lifestyle changes are all you need to improve your sense of taste. If you are a smoker, quit smoking to taste your food fully.2. Proper dental hygiene can also reverse impaired sense of taste.3. Through brushing and flossing, you can eliminate plaque from your mouth, protect your teeth from disease and decay, and help regain your full sense of taste.Bacterial sinusitis, salivary glands, and throat infections can be treated with antibiotics.Symptoms of colds, flu, and allergic rhinitis that impact taste may be relieved with decongestants or antihistamines.Once you are feeling better, your taste will most likely return quickly.Hope this helps.Please write back for further queries.Wishing you good health."},{"Patient":"Hi I have a recurring sore throat (no tonsils) headache, jaw ache which I've had for three weeks now.

Regarding your condition, you have reported that your wisdom tooth is broken, hence it would require treatment. The three treatment options available for your condition is1. Extraction of the tooth. (removal of tooth)2. Root Canal treatment (if the broken teeth has involved the pulp- pulp is the part where nerves and blood vessels are present)3. Removal of decayed area and filling (if the broken teeth has not involved pulp)Since you have opted not to get your teeth removed, either Root canal treatment or filling are the only options left for you. Your dentist will be able to decide whether you require root canal treatment or mere filling is sufficient.

After the 3rd day taken those medication, I felt my tongue numb and no taste.   I was old that can be a lingual nerve.

Today, I took the amoxicillin again, and my tongue feels more numb, and no taste, for tingling and burning cold hot feeling that was fading away.

I don't think that allergy of amoxicillin causes these kind of symptoms like numbness of the tongue,  because before the surgery also you were taking it if it did not caused numbness at that time,  then it should not happen this time.

She instructed me to try a hot wash clothe, wait for 30 mins. then to apply a cold/ice pack, along with taking Ibprofen's to see what effect that would have on it.

With regard to the healing it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to heal completely. But I think by 2weeks at least you should be relieved of  your soreness.

I thought it was natural losing hair but it's quite fast now and not only from the head. What should I tell the doc before I go for a check up. How bad can a dead tooth/ root canal be than? I also experience some joints problem sometimes which takes a massive time to recover. The swelling just never stops. I tried some antibiotics and omega's but no avail.","Doctor":"Hello,Swelling in between two upper teeth can be due to-periodontal infection resulting in bone loss or due to deep dental caries involving pulp tissue.I would suggest you to get a thorough clinical as well as x-ray evaluation done.Tooth has to be either extracted or root canal treated depending on the condition of underlying tooth.Complete course of metronidazole as well as analgesics has to be administered.Maintain oral hygiene well.Take care."},{"Patient":"I have had a very small lump or nodule on the inside of my upper jaw for the past 3-4 years. It started when my wisdom teeth came in. All four wisdom teeth are in. I have a horrible sinus infection, chronic, but I thought my wisdom tooth was the cause, I couldn't decide which one it was. About 7 days ago, I noticed I had a small cut near one of the nodules. It ended up getting infected, then drained and closed. The infection was still apparent in my mouth, so I then went to the dentist thinking it must be my wisdom tooth. Many x-rays were taken and all 4 wisdom teeth are healthy and look amazing. I started on antibiotics yesterday and the infection in my mouth and sinuses are clearing up. My dentist wants me to see a maxillofacial/oral surgery for problems with my #16th tooth. Should I be concerned","Doctor":"Hello thankyou for sharing your problem with us. the type of infection you are mentioning it looks like it is some tooth infection only, if not from the wisdom tooth then some other tooth, it is better to get a full mouth x-ray done, which is called as OPG,or for sinus infection get an PNS view done because without an x-ray it can not be ruled out."},{"Patient":"I am having pain in my lower abdomin that is going into my side and back on the right side.

It also hurts when I move my jaw certain ways, however the tooth has no pain and I have no pain from eating etc. it has been 4 days and I have been using mouthwash and salt water rinses in case it is an open wound. I am not getting much discomfort from jaw movement anymore however it is still sore to touch. Unfortunately as it is right up the back of the molar up the very top of the gum I cannot see what the gum looks like. I am planning to go to the dentist but won't be able to make it for another week and a half when I am off work. What could this possibly be? And is it safe to wait another week and a half before seeing a dentist?","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for writing to us.Since you are c/o pain at the site of back molar,chances of impacted wisdom tooth as well as gingivitis has to be ruled out.I would advice you to get a thorough scaling done.Impacted tooth has to be extracted or retained if present.Amoxycillin along with analgesics has to be administered.Meanwhile,maintain oral hygiene well.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi my name is angelo. Before I had this swollen hard palate I had a toothache (2 days) and then followed by sore throat (1 day) then followed by fever (1 day) then this swollen hard palate I have now. My hard palate is swollen and it is in pain when it is been touched by my tongue or when I'm chewing food. I already seen my dentist and she told me that there is no any problem about my hard palate swollen or any thing in my mouth. She just prescribed me to use oral mouthwash 2-3 times daily and apply iodine liquid 3-5 times a day. I didn't find any iodine liquid so what I did, I use Oral mouthwash 3 times a day and then I rinsed my affected hard palate with warm salt water 4-5 times a day. Now, it is already 4 days and still nothing has change. May I ask if it is really long to treat this swollen hard palate and may I ask if there is a better way to treat this. thank you so much.","Doctor":"Hello,Swollen hard palate usually occur due to-deep dental caries of associated tooth or periodontal infection as well as traumatic injury to any tooth.I would advice you to visit a dentist and get a thorough clinical as well as x-ray evaluation done.Based on the investigations,root canal treatment of the respective tooth as well as drainage of abscess has to be done.Complete course of analgesics along with antibiotics has to be administered.Meanwhile,maintain oral hygiene well.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi I have hard plaque on the back of my lower teeth.And the gums below my lower teeth are swollen.Sometimes it bleads when I bite into something.It bleeds all the time when I brush my teeth.I can see plaques between my lower back teeth too.I want to know what is happening to my teeth,what kind of food should I avoid and what should I do about this.Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood your concerns. You need to find out the actual cause as if you are a smoker then it may be due to nocotine stain and if you are chewing tobacco or related substances then also you will have same problem. If you are on phenytoin drug therapy consult your doctor for this. If you were my patient I will suggest you vitamin c chewing tablets which will help you and good oral hygiene will also get you out from this problem.

The thing is, this wasn't on my tongue yesterday, or at least for the most part I didn't feel it. It is quite painful and feels like a little cyst near the tip of my tongue. It is internal and I feel like it has been getting larger because I have beenagitating it, so I don't know what to do. It isn't really visible when I try to look in a mirror, it's just visible because it feels like a little sphere is there.Can you help? Thank you!","Doctor":"Hi! welcome to HCM! Tip of the tongue is sometimes painful and red due to Transient lingual papillitis.It occurs as an inflammatory condition of the fungiform papillae. The condition is the result of an injury or irritation to the front of the tongue, causing one or more  bumps on the tip that are painful and inflamed. Transient lingual papillitis typically resolves on its own after one to two days. It may develop again after another triggering event, including trauma to the tongue or other circumstances, such as stress.if it doesnot subside then it may be infection .you may need antibiotics. hope this helps!take care!"},{"Patient":"just had a dentist appointment about a week ago. I have braces and they broke my wire! So the back brackets don't have a wire on the bottom. Now the place I go to is Western Dental and it's also a Orthodontist place. They said they couldn't fix it until my next appointment which is on December 11. What should I do? Is this bad?","Doctor":"Hello, thank you for consulting with us for your problem. When  you are taking an orthodontic treatment it is better to keep in touch with the dentist as these type of problems arise commonly. if the wire is broken at the time of treatment it will delay the treatment as the wire will not be able to put pressure on the teeth and there will be no effect of the treatment. it is better to consult you dentist and get it fixed because visiting other dentist will be difficult for your treatment."},{"Patient":"I have excessive saliva gathered in my mouth at night.

My jaw hurts, ear pain and I have a swollen tonsil/gland all on my right side and neck pain. It doesn't hurt but sometime feels awkward swallowing. Initially the doctor said that it wasa sinus infection or allergies but it has been like this for going on three months. I went on antibiotics and allergy medication and I still have the swollen gland/tonsil at the back of my right throat. Could this all be due to the wisdom teeth? I'm getting them removed in a few weeks. I've also been in a lot of stress at work.","Doctor":"Hi, Thank You for contacting with us. the type of problem you are mentioning it can be because of your wisdom teeth only, because some times the wisdom teeth are impacted means they are placed inside the bone and they create similar problems. To get it confirmed it is better to get an x-ray done. Visit your dentist and get it removed as soon as possible."},{"Patient":"I have small red lines on one side of my mouth *roof* near my molar teeth. It looks kind of like veins. Awhile back I had some jaw breakers and I believe I chipped a tooth, but it wasn't too bad. By awhile back I mean like 3 months. My teeth are a little sensitive on that side, and I'm going to the dentist tomorrow. I can't really find anything already written, but I would like to know what it may be. My teeth don't seem to have cavities, though yesterday I accidentally scratched my gums trying to get something out of my front teeth. It's on the same side, though not far back and on the opposite side of the 'red veins'. Is it normal? If not, what could it be? My family has no oral cancer in it,  and both sides have relatively decent teeth. My mother has awesome teeth (and hers and so on) whereas my dads teeth are kind of brittle now that he is getting older and cavity prone. Let me think... yes, I do try to brush my teeth but I'm going going to lie and say \\"Every single day--- TWICE A DAY!\\" I normally brush them once and mouthwash. I understand this is not the way to go. Trust me, I understand whatever may be wrong with my mouth is my responsibility. Thank you and I hope to hear from you soon.","Doctor":"Hello, thank you for contacting with us as you have mentioned that one of your tooth chipped off, the red lines can be because of trauma from that tooth.

My question is that I had a very little black dot or spot inside my mouth, specifically in the soles of the cheek. It has been in my soles cheek for long time prob more than a year. The dot or spot that I had is normal which means I have never seen any strange changes on it. There is no changing in this dot. I had X- rea for my cheek at my Dental clinic, and they said nothing dangerous in my mouth. Is it normal or something will be dangerous in the future?? Please answer me I'm very tense and worried. ):","Doctor":"Hello, thank you for communicating with us for your problem. There can be many reasons for this black spot. But if there is no problem since one year and there are no changes associated with that then there is nothing to worry it can just be a melanin pigmentation. but still you have any adverse habit of taking areca nut, pan masala or gutkha then it will be much better to give a regular visit to your dentist."},{"Patient":"Hello. I have had these two reddish color, slightly raised at the bottom, bumps on the inside of my cheeks (1 on each side) with what apear to be cheek bites underneath. The \\"cheek bites\\" are white in color and slightly raised from the surface of the skin. It just looks like a white line in my mouth. At first I thought it was an irratation from my retainers, but it has been about 2 months now and they still havent gone away. I went to my doctor and he gave me some medicine for the bumps but they still havent completely gone away. They look better in appearance, (they are not as red now) but that's about all it did. Recently, I noticed that my throat hurts upon swallowing and an awkward feeling when food goes down my throat. I'm starting to get a little worried. In addition, the area around my last bottom tooth (just before the flap of skin from the removal of my wisdom teeth are) looks like it has a small yellow bump on it as well. It has become a little difficult to eat of that side of my mouth. I am a 17 year old female, btw. What do you think it is? Should I go to my dentist and have them look at it?","Doctor":"Hi, thank you for communicating with us for your problem, as you have mentioned that you have been noticing the white line or the cheek bite in your mouth since two months and after taking medication also it is not going off there is no need to take tension about that because in some people where the cusp of the teeth are slightly prominent they tend to make a mark on the both the cheeks which as called as linea alba in medical terms but if you  have some habit of taking areca nut,guthka or pan masala then you need to take care of it leave the habit and visit a good dentist. The hurting of throat is not related to this it seems you have some throat infection and the yellow bump which is present on the area of your tooth can be an aphthous ulcer or traumatic ulcer, you just apply an ointment named Mucopainit will heal within 1 week if not then visit your dentist nearby."},{"Patient":"hi i have 7mm cyst in my gallbladder and have advised to remove coz it may be cancer?","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to Healthcare Magic Forum.
