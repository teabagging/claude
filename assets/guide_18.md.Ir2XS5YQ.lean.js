In turn, she develops a bacterial infection. In the last three months, she has six bacterial infections. Her doctor gives her antibiotic medicines. She has chronic cough now and Budecort was suggested for three months Asthalin if cough. I need to know why she has frequent cold. The doctor suggests it is allergic, but no idea to what. There is no family history of asthma. I am worried about my daughter. She has developed this after two and a half years of being healthy.Does allergic cold happen due to the local home environment? My flat is in the first floor and near a hill. Nights are extremely cold. I have an oil-filled room heater. My kitchen has some leakage and a fungal smell comes out. Is this the reason for frequent allergy? Please suggest if I need to change my flat.","Doctor":"Hello. I went through in detail regarding your daughter's problem. According to me, the reason for her frequent chest congestion and repeated cough is not her bacterial infection. It is because her allergy level is high. Although you do not have any asthmatic in the family, your surrounding environment is not favorable to her. That is why she is continuously having cough off and on. These symptoms come under the heading of childhood asthma and medications which your daughter is using is actually the required treament. Try to clean the nearby environment in which she is living. There should be no smell of oil or any antifungal spray or any sort of smell which provoke her symptoms. So, try to avoid triggering factors of asthma as much as you can and add up one medicine, namely Myteka (Montelukast) tablet 5 mg at night time daily for three months to prevent future attacks of asthma.

About one week before, we have done a health checkup. His SGPT level has increased by 108. What should I do now?","Doctor":"Hello. Regarding quitting the alcohol, firstly you need to take him to nearby deaddiction center. You need to talk to him regarding the harmful consequences like liver damage which has now begun. You need to take him into confidence and take him to deaddiction center. There he will get counseling and assistance to quit alcohol. The patients are given medicine to reduce alcohol craving like Naltrexone and also medicines which will produce adverse effects on alcohol consumption, which you must have heard about. This medicine is Disulfiram 250 which you will be provided there which is given once daily. Regarding his SGPT, the best treatment is abstinence from alcohol. Also, other contributory factors like obesity, healthy lifestyle and weight loss will help to prevent further liver damage. At this stage, damage can be recovered but later this may become irreversible. Also, get him vaccinated for hepatitis B if not yet done. Also, he should be given plenty of water, adequate nutrition, fruits, and vegetables. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have gone through your medical history carefully and understood your concerns. Your uric acid level falls within the normal range for female patients (the normal range is between 2.5-7.5 mg/dL). I think Fabulas 40 (Febuxostat) you are taking is taking good control of your uric acid levels. For the moment, you are having pain in both knees and swelling in the ankle. Get an X-ray of the knee and ankle joints to evaluate the changes there.

She did pregnancy test today morning again; it came negative. We are confused and worried if she is pregnant. She has PCOD also. She had her last periods 45 days back. Do we have to go for a blood test?","Doctor":"Hello. The best way to rule out pregnancy conclusively is serum beta HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) test if she has not had her menses yet. If the HCG levels are less than 3mIU/ml, then she is not pregnant for sure. The delay in menses is then likely to be due to PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease) itself. An ultrasound pelvis would be required to confirm the diagnosis and then a withdrawal bleed can be opted for with progesterones to initiate a bleed.

I went to the urgent care, strep was negative but the doctor said it must be strep and would not listen to any of my symptoms. He spent about 30 seconds with me and is treating me with Biaxin. Pain is killing me, and my stomach is having a hard time with these antibiotics even with food.","Doctor":"Hello. From the picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity), your diagnosis is acute follicular tonsillitis. Usually, this is caused by strep, other bacteria responsible are Hemophilus and Moraxella. Starting an antibiotic at this stage helps in early recovery. As you have been started on antibiotics I would advise continuing that, but only one antibiotic that is Biaxin (Clarithromycin) to be taken after food. Antibiotics are known to cause gastric upset, which usually gets relieved once the course stops. If this is too much take Zantac (Ranitidine) 150 mg before food twice daily and take warm salt water gargles at least thrice a day. If there is no relief, please follow up after seven days.

I first noticed the symptoms when I had a sinus infection and was on Doxycycline three months back. I had pain in my right eyebrow that went away after antibiotic use, but the visual issue stayed. I had an eye exam with an ophthalmologist who told me he did not see anything wrong and that it was ocular migraines. I have since had recurring headaches that are persistent, but the visual disturbance does not change whether or not I have a headache.

Currently, I am on Lexapro 10 mg.","Doctor":"Hello. Regarding your concern, I would explain that your symptoms could be related to optic nerve damage or low blood pressure. As standing up triggers these symptoms, orthostatic hypotension cannot be excluded. Coming to this point, I would recommend measuring your blood pressure in sitting and standing up position.

However, it is important to learn if she has any hormonal imbalances and ever had irregular menses or not with possible causes being hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinemia or PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease). Nevertheless, the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) indicate rubella IgG positive, which indicates previous infection, not recent or ongoing. Secondly, the urine report shows urinary tract infection with WBC (white blood cells) and pus cells. So, she would require a short course of antibiotics for the same.

I have taken several different medications over the years and was most recently taking Lexapro 20 mg, Lamotrigine 50 mg, and Vyvanse 70 mg. The Lamotrigine is the newest medication I was prescribed. I had gotten the dose to 150 mg, but then I started having panic attacks, so we lowered the dose to 100 mg. That was fine for about a week, and then I started having panic attacks at that dose. We lowered the dose to 50 mg, and in two weeks, I started having panic attacks at that dose as well. It was helping with my depressed mood, but I have not taken it in the last three days. I am starting to feel more depressed, and I am not sure if it would be fine to take it at 25 mg or just stop taking it all together. I was previously prescribed Abilify 2 to 5 mg, but I was concerned that it was making me gain weight.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your query and understand your concerns. First of all, I would like to inform you that possibility of panic attacks is dose independent. I mean to say for panic attack prone individuals the panic attack can occur at a wide range (starting dose of 12.5 mg to 200 mg). However, it is observed that at a higher level, the chances remain much lower in some individuals. In other words, it can be stated that most of the individuals are prone to panic attacks at certain range. For example one of my patients had panic attacks in the dose range of 50 to 100 mg per day, but panic attacks ceased to exist once we crossed 100 mg per day.  Secondly, I would like to state that it is most likely fear of panic attacks which is bringing panic attacks to you even at the lower dose on the current day (presuming slow titration I feel it was not there when up-titration of Lamotrigine was done while building the dose of Lamotrigine). In other words, even our fear of panic attacks can bring more panic attacks and controlling our nerves may help you. Thirdly, I feel that Lamotrigine should be tried again under the cover of benzodiazepines (Diazepam or Lorazepam or Clonazepam or Alprazolam). My recommendation is based on the fact that benzodiazepines can take care of panic attacks while the Lamotrigine can take care of depression. Over a period of time, the propensity to cause panic attacks will decrease and benzodiazepines can be stopped slowly.

Coughing is now also accompanied by wheezing sometimes, and is at the peak during the dawn hours and causes extreme difficulty in sleeping.

Initially, he should have MDI (metered dose inhaler) or Rotahaler Asthalin (Salbutamol/ Albuterol) two puffs or one Rotacap whenever needed, up to four to six times a day. If coughing and shortness of breath are not relieved then he should also have Foracort (Formoterol and Budesonide) two times a day.

Initially, it was told to be a cyst. I followed up after four weeks, and the cyst was unchanged. My PCP recommended a needle biopsy to be safe. My surgeon felt more comfortable with lumpectomy because I have a family history of thyroid tumors, and I have a pituitary tumor. After the lumpectomy, I have been diagnosed with ER/PR positive, HER2 breast cancer. I am confused with my pathology report. It states DCIS, but also states a test was performed to confirm the lesion was invasive. It also calls it an infiltrating carcinoma. From what I have researched, this is contradictory. Currently, I am on Paxil 40 mg a day, Nexium OTC a day, Trulicity 1.5 mg SQ, Trulicity 1.5 mg SQ a week, Lisinopril 2.5 mg a day, Cabergoline 0.5 mg a day, and Amaryl 4 mg BID.","Doctor":"I have seen your reports. It looks like early breast cancer, and it is predominantly a cystic lesion. It is staged as pT1c Nx hormone receptor positive and HER2/neu negative. Histopathology is showing low-risk breast cancer as it is predominantly a cystic lesion with a predominance of intracystic papillary components, but there are areas of infiltrating mammary carcinoma and areas of DCIS (ductal carcinoma-in-situ). So, it is an early stage low-risk breast cancer. Have they done sentinel lymph node biopsy to check the lymph node status? You have a family history of thyroid tumors and previous personal history of a benign pituitary tumor. That may be part of some genetic syndrome. For that, you may need to go for genetic counseling. Your breast lesion is showing ER+, PR+ and HER2/neu negative. These are also good prognostic factors in breast cancer.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Help me out.","Doctor":"Hello. As you have given a history that you experience smelly white vaginal discharge without redness burning or itching since more than a year, and you had treatment for trichomonas, I would suggest you have a high and low vaginal swab to confirm the diagnosis. But as per history, it seems like an imbalance between normal and abnormal bacteria of the vagina. This might be due to: It increases the risk of getting other STDs like chlamydia, gonorrhea, or PID (pelvic inflammatory disease). It even increases the chances of getting HIV if having contact with an infected person. If pregnant, there are more chances of preterm labor/premature delivery. At present, you are not having symptoms, but you might have pain, itching and burning in the vagina, burning during urination, itching outside the vagina and strong fish-like odor after having sex as well. I would recommend you take some precautions along with recommended treatment: Metronidazole 500 mg orally twice a day for seven days or Metronidazole gel 0.75 % one full applicator (5 g) intravaginally once a day for five days or Clindamycin cream 2 % one full applicator (5 g) intravaginally at bedtime for seven days.

The symptoms of poor focus, lack of concentration, etc., can occur in depression but these are not sufficient to make a diagnosis of depression. Low mood, reduced energy, lack of interest in day to day routine, etc., are seen commonly in depression. Daydreaming could be due to poor focus and underlying anxiety.

Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

I can understand your concern. Sudden onset of anger could occur due to underlying mood disturbance. This can be due to depression or may be due to poor impulse control. If you have sudden onset anger with poor impulse control like throwing things, hitting others or abusing others suddenly then that should be treated properly.  Anger with symptoms like lack of interest in day to day routine, poor motivation, irritability, lack of desire to do anything then that could be due to depression. Depression can present with multiple pain symptoms too. The pain you have could be a somatic symptom of depression. In your reports, you have high bilirubin levels. This jaundice should be treated properly. Aztor (Atorvastatin), Ursodiol will help to treat jaundice. This can be the reason of your worsening of mood. You should wait for around four more weeks and get repeat liver function tests done. Once the levels become normal then we will see if the mood worsening is persistent. Did you have these symptoms prior to the onset of jaundice too? If these symptoms were present even before jaundice then that is due to depression. Drugs like SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) can be used to treat the depression. This will help in improving the mood too.

It acts by inhibition of ovulation. It increases the risk of heart attack, stroke and blood clot so better to avoid for years and years.

You missed Levlen and took two pills next day. Rule of missed pill for oral contraceptive pills is if less than three pills missed or low dose estrogen one pill, take next pills as per schedule, no need extra precautions.

But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Since your periods are regular and there is no other period-related issue, there is nothing to worry about. Just an accidental finding of a fibroid and such tiny size is no worry at all. Try to keep track of the fibroid, by repeating a scan after three months, just to check if it is growing in size. Till then, just relax and do not worry. You need not worry about the PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) as well. Just take proper diet, keep a check on your weight, exercise, and yoga will help you keep your PCOS in control.

In such a patient what we would do is a laryngoscopy. Just to rule out any growth or inflammation. Chronic sinusitis due to contact post nasal drip tends to cause reflux-related symptoms and globus feeling. Secondly, we need to check your hemoglobin status to rule out Plummer Vinson syndrome.

Last Sunday, he was knocked over while playing and hurt his arm. After getting up, he fainted. He was fine after that. There were no broken bones, but the medical center did an ECG, and it says on the ECG as non-confirmed diagnosis, incomplete RBBB marked left ventricular hypertrophy. We took this to a pediatrician and he said his ECG can be normal but said maybe seeing a cardiologist would make us feel better.

The pediatricians report says incidental finding of a partial RBBB and slight tall R waves in V4-V6. I have a copy of the ECG if needed.","Doctor":"Hello. The ECG (electrocardiogram) is showing incomplete RBBB (right bundle branch block) or early RBBB and features of left ventricular hypertrophy, and also heart rate is on lower side nearing 60 beats per minute.

Due to chronic exercises, there is thickening of heart wall similar to our biceps on workouts. This is seen as hypertrophy on. ECG and may cause RBBB and minor conduction abnormalities. So overall, it does not look worrisome, but we need to rule out hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as he also has fainting. So he will need echocardiography to confirm the findings.

Is it keeping my body from self-aborting?","Doctor":"Hello. All these drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, methamphetamine have their psychosocial side effect as well as harmful long-term effects on the body. They are just temporary anxiety relieving drugs, not only directly affect brain, bones, reproductive system, mental and physical health by accumulating in the body on long-term use, but also have withdrawal effects and pass via the mother's tissues to the baby and causes harmful effects on developing baby and even can cause long-term effects in the future. As you said, you already had previous two miscarriages and now in third-time pregnancy. You are still using meth, but have reduced its amount to half but still feeling anxious and stressed. Mostly, the baby gets affected at and starting 8 to 10 weeks of pregnancy. Organogenesis takes place in the early few weeks. So, the maximum effect is in these days. Before having an idea or planning for a baby, try to quit these harmful drugs including alcohol, cocaine, meth, tobbaco smoking, ketamine.etc. Before starting pregnancy, you should start Folic acid 0.4 mg if no other chronic illness and 5 mg if having chronic disease. In addition to quitting all the harmful drugs and habits, try to have an antenatal appointment as soon as possible, start Folic acid now and try to quit harmful drugs and habits.

I have been prescribed with AKT-4 kit and Benadon 40 mg for one month. I am taking this medication for the last five days and am feeling pain in my chest and rib area during breathing for past two days. Is it normal to have such pain during this medication or shall I visit the doctor?","Doctor":"Hello. I would like to ask a few questions. I am asking this because, though in more than 90 % cases effusion is due to TB, there can be other causes also. Anyway, for TB pleural effusion, you will need to take AKT-4 (Ethambutol, Isoniazid, Pyrazinamide, Rifampicin) for two months followed by AKT-3 (Rifampicin, Ethambutol, Isoniazid) for four months. In some cases, treatment might be extended to nine months. Now, regarding pain while breathing, it is a usual sign of pleural inflammation. While breathing two layers of pleura rub if they are inflamed and it causes pain. It is expected in case of pleural effusion. If you are having symptoms, you can take analgesic for a few days to relieve pain. But you will have to continue ATT (antitubercular treatment).

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours.

You can consult your Ayurvedic physician regarding this if you want to. Also, tell her to do simple breathing exercises daily. It will help her a lot. Take Desi ghee (clarified butter) made of cow's milk and put two drops of it in the lukewarm state in each nostril daily for one to two months. It will also help her in relieving symptoms.

Is there any basis to this claim? What if you are already anemic and suffering from menorrhagia? What complications are associated with the same? What precautions should one take if suffering from iron deficiency anemia? Please give me some tips to keep me healthy during my periods.","Doctor":"Hi. It is common for a woman to experience blood loss of 60-80 ml per menstrual cycle. In cases of menorrhagia the blood loss is heavier and in the form of clots or in terms of using more than 6-7 sanitary napkins daily during menses. Menorrhagia easily leads to anemia over a period of time if it has been chronic and has not been investigated and controlled or treated. Reasons for menorrhagia can be many, but most common being progesterone deficiency in reproductive age group. This can be easily diagnosed with a day 21 serum progesterone test and can be dealt accordingly with cyclical progesterone. If you are already anemic and have ongoing menorrhagia then likely that you would become further anemic if you have not been taking iron supplements and adequate green vegetables and salads in your diet maintaining the iron balance. A level of hemoglobin less than 7 g% is severe anemia in women, any levels less than 10.5 g% is termed as anemia. For preventing anemia, you must take green leafy vegetables in your diet and salads which are rich in iron and keep yourself well hydrated. Also take plenty of citrus fruits especially rich in vitamin C, which helps in absorption of iron in the body and promotes red blood cell production and increases hemoglobin and keeps healthy periods.

But the size of your cyst is large, more than 10 cm and it is a complex cyst (not simple) which would mean surgeon may have to see other intrabdominal structures also and may take more time to complete surgery, also you may feel uncomfortable if he has to extend incision above the umbilicus. So he has advised you for general anesthesia which is the most reliable option in your case.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

My shirt cannot stay on for at least 5 minutes. In some half an hour to one hour my whole shirt and armpit area will drench in sweat. Yes, I take a shower twice a day and put deodorant every day. I have even tried the antiperspirant deodorant, but that did not stop it and I think it made it worse. I really want to believe it is just puberty as this has been going on since I was 12 or 13. But, something tells me that it is not because of puberty. Everyone else at school does not have this problem and some relatives in my family has it too. Just like my shirt, my pants will start soaking after 30 minutes of sitting down. I really want a diagnosis or close to one before I actually go to a doctor as I have not yet regarding my issue. Also are there any home remedies or other over-the-counter deodorant to help minimize this issue or completely stop it? I am really fit and regularly lift weights, play lots of sports (soccer, boxing, etc.,) and keep my body in good shape. I know that weight lifting could not be a problem if that was a suggestion. I sweat a lot when I am in social places such as school or when I go out. It is not because of anxiety, but I rarely feel nervous when my arms are getting drenched. This is a more serious problem in the morning either at home or at a social place and gradually calms during the afternoon when I am at home. It is so bad that my armpits can drench two layers of clothing. For example, if I wear a shirt and a jacket over it, then it does not really matter how many layers and by the end of the day my clothing will be soaked in sweat. I do not really have any symptoms besides the fact that I am always on alert when I am out. This is really embarrassing and I have no idea what to do about this. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi.

She had it for almost a year and nothing was diagnosed from the tests and then suddenly it got fine. Now again she got a fever from some stomach infection and it has been 15 days that the fever is there between 99 to 100 degrees. What could be the possible reason?","Doctor":"Hello. Did your mother undergo urine culture sensitivity? Because many of the postmenopausal or perimenopausal women suffer from urinary tract infection that is chronic and drug-resistant due to urinary leak and urinary urgency. Low-grade fever can also be there due to chronic infections like tuberculosis. So, if a chest X-ray is not done, I suggest you do so. Lymphoma or lymphoid malignancy can often be missed as a differential diagnosis of low-grade fever. At last, some autoimmune diseases can present with a similar type of low-grade fever and diffuse musculoskeletal pain. If there is pain associated, get a blood test done for ANA (anti-nuclear antibody).

This has happened for many months now. I wash my face with Cetaphil cleanser and sometimes Ketoconazole shampoo. This removes some of the pus but my face is still red and a little itchy. I took several different antibiotics for severe acne in my teenage years and early 20s. I shave using an electric shaver with a guard so the blade never touches the skin and the hair is still about 2 mm long.","Doctor":"Hi.  I saw your pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity). This condition is called folliculitis. It is the infection of hair follicles that form red bumps and pustules around the opening of hairs on the skin surface. Most of the time the infection is bacterial in origin, caused by Staphylococcus or Streptococcus. Sometimes the yeast in the skin can also be the cause for folliculitis. The treatment for folliculitis includes: Before applying the medication, after washing face, clean the area with warm saline water using clean cotton cloth or gauze (never cotton, because cotton gets stuck to the skin). Dip the cloth or gauze in warm saline, gently clean the area. Then apply Clindamycin lotion in the morning and Miconazole gel at night. Do not prick the lesions. Wash face very gently. Avoid close shaving or reverse shaving. If this problem is occurring repeatedly then you need to undergo swab testing for culture and sensitivity of the bacteria inside the pus. Other possibilities are acne and Rosacea. Both can have pustules. Acne involves almost whole of face, chest, and back. Rosacea involves center of the face, chin, nose, and prominence of the cheek. Trying to rule out these two conditions.

I have too much anxiety. I am unable to eat food too due to fear. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hello. The chances of transmission of HIV by protected intercourse is nil if used in a right way. Tri-dot being negative after one month is good. The chances of HIV tests coming positive later is almost nil.

The strips will whiten only the portion of the tooth that it comes in contact with. If it is a fixed retainer, then you can use it on the front surface, but do not let the chemical touch your inner surfaces of teeth. I will prefer not using it in such a case, as there will be a difference of color in your outer (front) and back (inner) surfaces of teeth. If it is removable, you can. Make sure you remove all the excess material from the mouth and teeth before putting the retainer back on. If your teeth are sensitive, then it might ache a little while placing back the retainers.  I would recommend you not to whiten teeth regularly as it can weaken your teeth and cause sensitivity in the long run. You can also ask your dentist regarding tray and gel method, for at-home whitening methods. Take care.

A week ago, he suddenly fell on the ground while walking and his right leg was injured. He was transferred to hospital and X-ray indicted his leg is not broken but severely ricked, as a result, it is not moving and will need time to recover. However, the problem is not the injured right leg but the left leg. His left leg is fully functional (i.e., he can move his knee and toes without any pain and numbness) in laying down and sitting position but once he stands up, he can not even rise up his left leg from the ground. Therefore, he is now completely paralyzed and unable to walk. What could be the reason? Here are some details about his medical background. He is about 70 years old. He has been suffering from type 2 diabetes for over 20 years and three years ago was prescribed to use Insulin. Recently, his doctor told him that his blood sugar is under control. He experienced previous imbalance feeling and fell several times while walking in past. Basically, whenever he stood up, he would need an effort to gain his balance. His hands also have been shaking a bit. He had an open heart surgery 10 years ago. He had a back pain (even in laying down position) which went worse after the accident. He has lost a majority of his vision over the years due to glaucoma. His X-ray indicates no broken bone.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I read carefully your question and would explain that this clinical situation could be caused by a stroke, which is probably the cause of falling. Another possible cause would be a nerve damage related to the trauma. For this reason, it is important performing a brain CT (computed tomography) scan or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) to investigate for a possible stroke. If this test result is normal, I would recommend performing a nerve conduction study to examine his nerves.

Calcium score is not as informative as Lexiscan. It is a screening test and not a diagnostic. CT coronary angiography may yield a better information, but has false positive and negative rates. However, CT coronary angiography may be used as an alternative rather than calcium score. Also, treadmill test is an alternative to Lexiscan if he is able to perform exercises.

But, I have forgotten some numbers and I am frequently mixing things up. Another thing that has happened is that I cannot sleep at nights. I have to leave the window open and wrapped in several blankets to sleep, because either I feel too hot or too cold where in a split second I am either sweating or shivering. I also get massive waves of heat or cold. My hands and feet normally go cold and numb during my cold episodes and when I get hot, I feel dizzy and nauseous. I feel distressed. I generally see myself as a person who barely eats or drinks, but for the past month I have been drinking three times more than usual and eating full, but healthy meals. I would just like to know if there is a diagnosis or at least some steps that I can take to minimize this. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi.

I never had shortness of breath, severe chest pain, heavy sweating/dizziness, or like I will pass out. It also never goes on for several minutes, just around 10 to 20 a day. I went to see a cardiologist, who did an ECG and echo - said there is nothing to worry and this is normal. He said to call him when more per minute (so a lot of PVC each minute). He also said it is not stress related, but I have highly stressful work. I am still little worried. Will it never go away and can it, in the long run, hurt me?","Doctor":"Hello. I passed carefully through your question and would explain that some PVC or ectopic heartbeats are quite normal in every healthy individual during emotional stress or physical activity. Anyway, a cardiac arrhythmia cannot be excluded either. Coming to this point, I would recommend performing an ambulatory 24 to 48 hours ECG monitoring (Holter) to examine your heart rhythm trends for a prolonged time and investigate for possible cardiac arrhythmia. Some blood lab tests are needed to exclude some metabolic disorders which may trigger this clinical scenario: If all these tests result normal, you should consider anxiety as a possible cause of your complaints. In such case, consulting with a specialist in this field (physiotherapist, psychiatrist) would be needed. If the situation persists, a low dose of beta-blockers (Metoprolol) could help reduce the ectopic heartbeats.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Also, I get scared of certain people or situations where I feel that I will be judged. Always, I think that people are judging me on whatever I do. So, I get anxious. This is a pattern since long. I understand that I can overcome it, as I find that there are few reference points in my memory where I have handled those situations well. I think I need help now as it interferes in my day to day life. Although I am able to manage it till now and am leading a good life, I think that I can do much better at work and relationships and will be able to enjoy life.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your problem. Feelings that people are judging you, becoming conscious when people are around you could be occurring due to anxiety, most likely social anxiety. This should be evaluated properly. Social anxiety can be treated easily with medicines and behavior therapy. This will help improve your productivity. Please provide me more details in follow up.

Yesterday, he went without peeing for about five to six hours at night. Since few days he is also crying when urinating (before and after as well). His penis is also ballooning during peeing and at times it seems like he is straining or pushing. He does not cry always also when peeing. I showed a doctor about the ballooning and pain and he looked at the penis and told that his skin is too tight and the hole is small. He told to push the skin back and apply an ointment (Fusidic acid based) after bath. I just applied it once as I am not sure about pushing the back skin and the ointment itself. We also did a urine routine today and everything is nil (pus 1-2 /hpf and epithelial 2-3 /hpf). Is there anything to worry about? Please advice. It is very hot climate here right now.","Doctor":"Hello. Relax and do not worry. Yes, what the doctor suggested is absolutely right. He has tight foreskin called physiological phimosis.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

After three months from my last exposure I did ELISA test for HIV 1 and 2. It came back negative. Again, I did the same mistake after one year, condom break with a sex worker. Then after five years I did HIV test ELISA 1 and 2 and it came back negative. I was about to get married that time. I did not believe the results because my brain keeps telling me maybe the last laboratory did not do a good job or maybe the one who is working in the laboratory did not know how to perform the test.

Does one receive a higher SAR limit and RF exposure if they weigh more? For example, if a patient weighs 225 lbs would his or her SAR limits and subsequent RF exposure be higher or lower than someone who is 250 pounds? Thank you in advance.","Doctor":"Hello. The SAR (specific absorption rate) is directly dependant on the patient's weight and would definitely be more for a 250 lb person than a 225 lb. The second issue is that radiation heat is more at the surface than the deeper layers of the tissue. So, to conclude, chances of burns are more in patients with more weight than lean patients. However, there are FDA guidelines to prevent such incidences. In case you are suspecting burns, please inform the respective MRI unit regarding management and also to prevent such incidents in the future. Take care.

Further, as I complained stiff calf muscle and a bit of pins and needle in the legs, especially after sitting in the bathroom, a nerve conduction study was taken. Before that, a VEMP test was done.

He currently has below symptoms:  Body tremors. Swallowing problems. No saliva control. Speech difficulty. Unable to stand on one leg. Severe weakness. Looks skinny. Frequent urination (it seems fine now after medication).  We are currently giving medications which are Roslay Gold, Solitral, Liofen-XL, Rejunex CD3, Urimax, Telpres + Aldactone, Glimsame MV, Cilidoc and Donep M forte. I would like your suggestion if any of the above drugs are optional or duplicate? I do not know but want to do my best for my father. So, I am checking online for many things. I got one doubt if Donep M forte and Rejunex CD3 can be given together? Will they cause any side effect if combined? I can show my father online if that is possible. You may ask for more details as I am not sure which data you may need to suggest me a better option. I do not see much improvement after four months of this treatment.","Doctor":"Hello. I reviewed all your father's therapy. I would explain that there is no interaction between these drugs and it is fine to take them concomitantly. Donep-M (Donepezil plus Memantine) is a drug used for dementia. While Rejunex CD3 is composed of vitamin B1 and alpha lipoic acid. It is fine to take these drugs. I would also recommend taking daily Aspirin 80 or 100 mg if no contraindications. It seems that your father has vascular dementia, urinary incontinence, diabetes, and arterial hypertension. Peripheral neuropathy cannot be excluded, considering the fact that he suffers from diabetes. Investigations to be done: Brain MRI, and nerve conduction study. Hope you will find this answer helpful.

For the past six to seven months, his blood pressure has been very much under control with Ayurvedic treatment. So, he very gradually decreased and stopped taking the medicines. Around four to five weeks back, his blood pressure started rising again. So, he re-started some medications after consultation with the doctor. Now, we are seeing fluctuations in his daily blood pressure varying from (systolic readings) 115 - 170 during a day (his systolic blood pressure reading even dropped to 95 after taking one of the tablets - Prazopress, after which doctor asked to take that specific tablet - Prazopress on requirement basis). We have had all the relevant tests, which look fine as per our doctor, except for high cholesterol and Vitamin-D deficiency. He is currently taking Nebicard, Clopitorva, Olmax and sometimes Prazopress when his blood pressure shoots over 170. He also takes appropriate precautions with food and goes for morning and evening walks each for 30 minutes. What is the significance of this fluctuating blood pressure? Are there any risks involved? Do we need to change the medication?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your query, and I have seen the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Firstly, I think that the Atorvastatin dose you are getting may be too low. A dose of 20 mg may be needed at the least, and Clopitorva (Atorvastatin plus Clopidogrel) has only 10 mg. So, I think you need to change it. Secondly, I think I would suggest the vitamin D replacement. A Calcerol (Cholecalciferol) sachet of 60000 units once in a week with a glass of milk should help. Take this for six weeks. Then repeat Vitamin D for seven weeks. Take it on the same day every week. I think Olmesartan that you are getting is a good choice. But the dose may not be sufficient. Since you have not mentioned the dose in the query, I cannot comment on it. Also, considering the fluctuations, I would recommend two doses of Telmisartan instead. This may help keep the blood pressure uniformly stable. Also, he is on too many anti-hypertensives. I usually recommend giving any one and then step up slowly. Personally, I do not understand the query why Clopivas is being given. A blood thinner is usually given in a patient of heart disease or stroke. So, this point you may discuss with the good doctor who initiated the medicine. This is same for Nebicard. I would suggest testing kidney function. I hope this information helps.

I had HSG again, and I do not know if there was spilling on the right side but no hydrosalpinx. Some doctors suggest left tube corneal end cauterization, but I was afraid. I had the hysteroscopy and was free, and I am now on the second trial with the frozen ones but experienced now some watery vaginal discharge, and I am worried if there is hydrosalpinx and the second HSG after disconnection what do you think and what you suggest?","Doctor":"Hello. I find lots of misunderstandings in the history. From the report you have sent, I can say that your uterus is normal and thereby there will be no problems in undergoing IVF. Once the tubes have been disconnected, how can you still have HSG showing spill in either tube? The inner diameter of the tube is 1 mm and is so sensitive. Once the tube has been disconnected by a knot or clip or cautery or any other method, then there can be the reversal of patency only by surgery, if the prognosis is bad. I do not see any fluid collection inside the tubal area. As you see there is no such connection between uterine cavity and tubes. So the watery discharge cannot be from tubes. Fluid could be from erosion on the cervix, or a vaginal infection, which can be treated locally. So in total, I feel the uterus is normal and can confidently go ahead with IVF, no need to have any further interventions on tubes. They are not visible and have no connections with the uterine cavity. So neither can fluid enter uterus from tubes nor can embryo enter tubes from the uterus. To further substantiate my advice, your hysteroscopy was also normal. So just do not worry about it. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more queries and give me your feedback.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

And another rheumatologist told me I do not have enough symptoms for RA. However, I have been using Methylprednisolone 4 mg for almost four years every day. And this helps me completely get rid of any problems. If I do not take it for a day all my joints start to swell and it is unbearable. The second rheumatologist prescribed Methotrexate to me and now I am taking this for already four months together with the Methylprednisolone. But, I still cannot get rid of the Methylprednisolone. How dangerous is it taking this drug for already so long? Will it prevent me being able to have children? What is my best option? I am open to travel to any hospital in the world. Symptoms started four years ago.","Doctor":"Hello. Well, it is a tough spot you are on. It will be difficult for a new rheumatologist to diagnose if you are already on steroids and the symptoms get masked. But I will try to simplify it for you here. Could you let me know the results of rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP antibody, and ANA? If they are negative, it will reduce the probability of rheumatoid arthritis. Steroids on a long-term basis are always harmful. It can cause cataract, osteoporosis, and diabetes mellitus. It is like a drug which cannot be withdrawn so easily. So, to figure out if it is rheumatoid or not the first thing is serology (blood test advised). Second is to get an ultrasound of the joints done. It will help us detect if there is anything underlying. Either way, steroids are not the option for you. You will have to put in a lot of effort to go off it. Your doctor may have to give you a steroid-sparing agent for a short course to help you come of it. Steroids as such do not cause difficulty in pregnancy, but they do cross the placenta if taken on a higher dose and may affect the baby. So, we got to get you off it and streamline your treatment. Firstly, if it is rheumatoid or not and secondly what medications you need.

I completely understand that you are concerned about your symptoms of social anxiety, panic, and depression. All of the signs you mentioned are clearly indicative of a psychological disturbance which is affecting your current life functioning. Generally, there are past negative experiences related to social and academic functioning which create fear of humiliation if the person undergoes panic attack in social situations. Therefore, individuals with agoraphobia avoid social situations and might experience panic attacks. Cognitive behavior therapy is found to be the best treatment for agoraphobia and panic attacks. Do start your treatment at the earliest as those who complete treatment at early stages of their disorder are likely to recover faster.

Unprotected oral sex carries negligible to low risk for HIV acquisition especially if there are fresh cuts or sores or lesions or bleeding gums. Mutual masturbation and kissing are quite safe.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill.

Sciatica is usually due to local compression over the nerve supplying legs like the one with disc prolapse. Arimidex (Anastrozole) is a hormone used for the treatment of breast cancer and can cause diffuse bone loss. That is why we give calcium and Vitamin D with these hormones to maintain the bone density. So my suggestion is to continue Arimidex till the response is there.

I have thoroughly gone through the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity), and I understand that she did not have any symptoms, but you got the tests done just for the regular checkup. Out of these, there are some red flags which need to be further evaluated like the low iron and low values indicating an iron deficiency anemia. Also, the stimulating thyroid hormone is raised, but T3 and T4 are normal which could be subclinical hypothyroidism. For this, we need to see if there are any thyroid antibodies present. Please get the tests that I mention below done. Also, the raised ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase) needs to be looked at. Given that CRP (C-Reactive Protein Test) is raised it means there is an underlying disease process. It could be the subclinical hypothyroidism, or it could be something else. Sometimes autoimmune hypothyroidism can be associated with other conditions that can cause both anemia and a raised ALP. Please get the tests done so that we can promptly get to the bottom of this.

I am 43 years old, non-smoker, and drink one to two glasses of wine per month. Kindly tell me what this could be?","Doctor":"Hello. I saw the photo you have attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Although there is a lot of reflected light, I can make out that you have enlarged tonsils and edematous uvula. However, due to the reflected light and distortion of natural color, I cannot make out whether the area is congested, red or pale. The color is essential to conclude the condition of the mucosa, whether it is inflamed or not. Second, I assume that the only symptom you feel is a sense of something stuck in the throat. There is no pain, fever, cough or thick phlegm, etc. These symptoms if present would indicate infection and you may need antibiotics for that. Hence, in your case, I would like to give the following medicines if you were to come to me in my clinic. A proton pump inhibitor like Prilosec (Omeprazole) or Prevacid (Lansoprazole). These prevent acid reflux into the throat and reduce inflammation and edema inside. Reflux worsens any inflammation in the throat due to constant irritation by the acid that escapes into the esophagus and comes up to the level of the throat. Anti-inflammatory medicines like Chymotrypsin, Trypsin, Bromelain, and Rutoside. These components increase the recovery and hasten healing. They promote mucosal regeneration and reduction of edema. Deslor 5 mg (Desloratadine) will remove any allergic component of the condition. Many a times allergy to any offending agent causes inflammation and enlargement of tonsils. General and supportive measures would be to drink plenty of fluids, avoiding spicy oily and masala foods, drinking plenty of warm water, avoiding smokes and drinks till you are completely better, avoiding the dust outside, wearing a mask if you travel to polluted areas, etc. Suppose there is an infection, the symptoms of which I have told you, then you may need a Macrolide antibiotic, with some decongestants and gargles. Gargles in reflux will worsen or aggravate the symptoms. Hence, I have not suggested gargles now. However, in the event of infection, we will have to tweak the medicines a bit. If you can click a better picture of the throat, without torch light, focussing your smartphone alone with flash, it will be better. Try sending us few more images. Also check for any enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, under the jaw, under the ear, etc. For more information consult an ENT otolaryngologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have sex problem such as zero to one-minute timing.

It seems like you are suffering from premature ejaculation. There are several causes for this condition. Like regular masturbation, watching porn movies, engaged in erotic novel or thought, stress, anxiety, smoking and drinking habits, other medical conditions like diabetes, etc. Premature ejaculation is mostly psychogenic and it reflects your psychology and thoughts while intercourse. But it can be managed through ayurvedic medicines and Yoga practices. Small-sized penis does not matter but the penis should be erected for a period while intercourse. Even two to three inches of erected penis would be able to provide sufficient pleasure while intercourse. Before intercourse, foreplay is very important to improve your concern.

We did some blood tests a year back as per our gynecologist's advice in view of positive ANA two years back which came normal in the same year. According to that, her IgG for antiphospholipid was normal, and IgM was positive. Also, IgG and IgM for toxoplasmosis were positive. Our doctor started tablet Rovamycin Forte and Ecosprin 75. She took Rovamycin Forte for two months. Eight months back we again checked for toxoplasmosis which was found negative, i.e., IgG and IgM for toxoplasmosis were negative. Hence, the doctor stopped Rovamycin but continued Ecosprin 75. Two months later, my wife became pregnant, and her LMP was at the end of the same month. Two months later, the doctor again advised for antiphospholipid and toxoplasmosis. IgG and IgM for antiphospholipid were negative, but IgG and IgM for toxoplasmosis were dramatically high. Hence, the doctor started Rovamycin Forte again. Now, we are taking Rovamycin Forte for past six months again. Please guide me on the below queries:  Is there any other way to check the presence of toxoplasmosis in view of dramatic results of tests found? Is it necessary to take Rovamycin? If yes, for how long it should be taken? Will Rovamycin prevent infection to the fetus? Will Rovamycin affect baby’s growth? (double marker test was done five months back and was normal). Is there any way to check the presence of infection of toxoplasmosis in the baby?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, to rule out acute infection or re-infection there is a role of IgM avidity testing and once the toxoplasmosis IgM is negative and IgG titers are high, then IgG titer is repeated every four weeks.The rising titers are suggestive of active infection, and amniocentesis is done to detect congenital toxoplasmosis infection in placenta and baby. If an active infection is there, then to prevent the transmission of infection to the baby, Rovamycin (Spiramycin) in a dose of 1 to 2 gm daily for three weeks and then one week off for three to four months is given. It is the infection which affects the baby's growth and not the drug itself so much.

You will need a scaling but as of current lockdown situation, I would advise not to hurry as you and your babies safety is of utmost importance. You can have it later. Use a soft brush and learn proper verticle stroke technique of brushing instead of forceful horizontal motion. Avoid sticky or sweet food as much as possible. Hormonal changes during pregnancy initiate gingivitis. Gingivitis. Medications for now. Medication may cause a transient metallic taste but nothing to worry. Avoid sweet or sticky food."},{"Patient":"My 3.4year old kid has nasal polyps which is 3/4th coveres into his left nostril and 1/4th covered in right nostril, he always breaths through his mouth, whenever he does some activity he feels little dypsnea, but never stops being naughty, he snores while sleeping which is more concern to me. Till now, he did say any headache or other issues like pain in nostril or something, please please need your help. Due to this lockdown can't visit ent clincs near by.","Doctor":"Hello, welcome to iCliniq Nasal blockade due to any cause be it adenoids or polyps do cause snoring.It is because any obstruction in the the nasal cavity nasopharynx does alter the normal resonating properties of the nasopharyngeal chamber causing snoring. The masses you are seeing are not polyps. They are turbinates. Turbinates are normal structures. The left one seems to be enlarged though. What problems does your child have ? Does he complain of nasal obstruction? Is his sleep disturbed? He is probably having adenoids. Adenoids usually grow only up to 5 to 6 years and disappear on their own by 9 to11 years. However if it is causing difficulty in breathing , then you can get them removed. However snoring isn't that much a problem. You can use decongestants like Otrivin P nasal drops. that would help relieve the congestion and improve breathing."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I just read your query and from what you have mentioned it appears that your thyroid nodule and lymph nodes are enlarged. Your thyroid function test results are good (attachment removed to protect patient identity) but you have to do an FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) as your nodule is more than 1 cm in size and it is mandatory to get an FNAC of the same. After FNAC, we will decide whether you need a surgery or not. But, in my opinion, it is of utmost importance to get an FNAC done as soon as possible.

Surfers eye or pterygium can only be corrected by a small surgery. The precaution you are taking are very good, but these are for stopping the growth or stopping the recurrence.

I always clear throat coughing up clear mucus or clumps. I have a very little sore throat. Always feel like I got something stuck in the bottom of my throat.","Doctor":"Hi. Mucus trickling down to the throat from nasal cavity is suggestive of sinusitis. When your sinuses are infected, the normal physiology of nose is lost, and mucociliary action of the nasal mucosa is lost which causes the formation of thick mucus which trickles down to the throat and causes secondary throat, and larynx infection. The patient will feel that something is stuck in their throat. Do you have any symptom of a headache (frontal especially) or excessive sneezing or watering of eyes? A headache is again the symptom of sinusitis, and excessive sneezing and watering of eyes will be more of allergy.

This chronic pain started with a fever eight and half years back since then it has been with me. Sometimes it soars for 10-15 days once in six months. Symptoms are chronic pain, cough and sore throat, pain in the jaw, pain in the eye (burning sensation) like some inflammation starts in right half of my body, fever due to this cough, sore throat (not high but 99-100), the repetitive urge of micturition in worse days.

I would suggest you start on tablet Soliten (Solifenacin) 5 mg morning and evening for seven days and see how do you feel. Somewhere in your reports, you have mentioned that you have RBC in urine? If that is there, then it is not normal. So do the urine routine and microscopy test.

Recently, I have elevated AST levels. There is no hepatitis or inflammatory diseases, alcohol, drug use, or fatty liver, or Addison's. Liver biopsy showed inflammation, but a resolving process likely attributed to a year long Lyme disease treatment with various pharmaceuticals but discontinued two years ago. Liver enzymes dropped to 50 ALT, but have recently elevated to 130 ALT. At this point, there is no known cause. I was told to continue to wait and see. I would like to take a different approach and determine if there is something my hepatologist is not seeing. The current medications are Lamictal and Gabapentin, Trazodone. I had abdominal CT, abdominal MRI, liver biopsy, ultrasounds, and a significant amount of blood work.","Doctor":"Hi. You should not wait. There is some cause that is creating an issue for the liver. It is continuously damaging your liver. Cause of hepatitis in your case could be drug-induced liver injury (DILI). All these three medications are reported to cause liver injury; though this is more common with Lamotrigine (1% case have hepatotoxicity) and less common with rest two and only described in case reports. To prove DILI, we need to rule out other treatable causes of liver disease, DILI is a diagnosis of exclusion. Most common causes are nonalcoholic fatty liver, alcohol, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis B&C, cholestatic and muscle disorders. We need to evaluate as soon as possible to prevent the further damage to the liver. First, we need to diagnose the liver disease. Secondly, we need to quantify the damage severity for prognostication. Probable cause: Drug-induced liver injury, NASH, Autoimmune hepatitis. Investigation to be done: Liver function test, complete blood count with ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation test) and peripheral smear examination, Immunoglobin G, ceruloplasmin, ANA/ASMA/A-LKM/ASLA antibodies, TSH/T3/T4, serum iron-ferritin-total iron binding capacity, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, CPK (creatine phosphokinase test) total, ultrasound liver, and fibroscan. Differential diagnosis: Drug-induced liver injury, NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), Autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, and viral hepatitis (B/C) Treatment plan: The treatment plan will be started after identifying the etiology.

For your tiredness, you have investigated properly with liver, kidney and thyroid profiles (attachment removed to protect patient identity). That reports are within range. So, liver, kidney, and thyroid illness are ruled out here. Your lymphocytes are slightly high. So, a temporary viral infection can be the possibility. For that, symptomatic management can be done, and Vitamin C tablet can be prescribed too.  If fatigue remain persistent, then EMG (electromyography), NCV (nerve conduction study) can be done to rule out neuromuscular illness for which the neurologist should be consulted for neurological examination and the reports. Autoimmune disease, more work, lack of sleep, etc., also can be associated with fatigue.  If no specific cause is found, then anxiety related or chronic fatigue syndrome can be the possibility. If any other specific history is associated, then provide it for giving more comment. Consult neurologist for your physical examination and discuss all these.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

He was taken to the hospital a year back due to confusion and memory loss and was treated for diabetic ketoacidosis and had a quadruple bypass performed. They also did various scans and MRIs and found nothing to indicate a reason for the memory issues. They ascribed it to the DKA and lack of oxygen to the brain due to heart blockages and told us his symptoms should subside after his recovery. After 13 months, he is only getting worse. He cannot remember appointments or plans and has to put everything on his phone to remember (including his birthday). He does not remember what he has done the previous day and sometimes believes he did something he did not. He does not remember events of past 10 to 15 years (including forgetting where his house is that he has lived in for 24 years), but his youth is still vivid in his mind. He turns 61 tomorrow, so he is fairly young for this kind of memory loss. Does this point to Alzheimer's, and if so, what stage is he in? Or does this seem more likely to be vascular dementia? Or something else entirely?","Doctor":"Hello. Your father's symptoms are indicative of dementia. I would like to review his brain MRI report, to give a more professional opinion if it is Alzheimer disease or vascular dementia. As he is diabetic, vascular dementia cannot be excluded. Anyway, you should know that vascular dementia is associated with many small strokes visible in the brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) while Alzheimer is associated with brain atrophy in the temporal lobes. I would recommend consulting with a neurologist and performing some cognitive tests to determine the stage of the disease. Based on your prescription, it seems to be an advanced stage, as he forgets about his past too. I would recommend starting treatment with Donepezil or Memantine. Taking Aspirin daily and better control of diabetes and hypertension is necessary to slow the progression of the disease. You should discuss with his doctor on the above treatment options.

If at all she has asthma, does she has to take medicine life long?","Doctor":"Hello. According to the history you have provided, it is difficult to conclude whether she has asthma. Pneumonia sometimes takes a month to completely flush out of the lungs. The doctor must have prescribed the medication according to her physical and laboratory examination. Coming to your question of Budecort (Budesonide), if the doctor has confirmed that she has asthma, then yes, the year-long inhaler is necessary.

They will get used to this sensation and start feeling comfortable with it. Next time if he says so, put a wet cloth over the penis so that it calms down. Coming to the whitish discharge. Since you have already taken him to the doctor they must have ruled out any urinary tract infection which is the most common reason for the discharge. It must be the normal body secretions. Nothing to worry. But, if he has developed fever or redness around the area, please consult immediately.

They put me on Metformin 500 mg twice daily. I have been taking it for almost two weeks, and my fasting glucose levels are not going under 300 mg/dl. I do not have the doctor's appointment until next week. So, shall I continue with just 1000 mg of Metformin a day?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome back to icliniq.com. I understand your concern. Going by your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it looks like you need an increase in the dose of medication. Your doctor may either choose to increase the dose of Metformin or to add another new drug to the existing dose of Metformin. Another option is to prescribe insulin injections. Metformin can be taken at a dose up to 1000 mg twice a day (2000 mg/day). But it is ideal for you to meet your doctor so that you get a proper prescription for a clinical examination. Lifestyle changes will help you a lot. Avoid sweet food and high-calorie food (containing oil, cheese or cream). Include lots of raw vegetables in your diet. Exercise regularly. You can start by walking 30 to 45 minutes daily. Weight loss will help you to a great extent to bring down blood sugar levels. Even a 10 % reduction in weight can reflect as significant improvement in your health status.

What remedy do you advise? If I did the valvoplasty surgery will there be any other problem? If there is a problem, is there a possibility to do the valvoplasty again? I am afraid. Please relieve my tension. The left atrium is 46 mm. I am currently on Spiromide 20 mg and Tinormin 50 mg daily once. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hello. There are specific criteria for surgery in case of mitral valve stenosis. Surgery does not resolve the problem and you may have to stay on anticoagulation therapy for your entire life. It can help improve your physical performance and avoid pulmonary edema (shortness of breath during physical exertion). Anyway, as you have mild mitral valve stenosis, I would recommend anticoagulation therapy and follow up with your cardiologist with a cardiac ultrasound every six months. Hope this would be helpful for you. For more information consult a cardiologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am four days late, and today I had some very light spotting mixed with discharge. I have very light cramping and no other symptoms. I had a miscarriage two months ago. Is it related to my hormones being imbalanced?","Doctor":"Hi. I feel there is some hormone imbalance and it could be the reason for the miscarriage too. Your weight is more than expected. This extra fat will be converted into hormones in the body. This hormone can prevent or delay ovulation, could be the reason for the delay in periods. The inner lining of the uterus will start getting detached on its own. This would appear as bleeding of different severity and as it tries to come out will cause cramps. This is what you are experiencing. You should get bleeding in the coming days, with thick fleshy masses. This is common after miscarriages. So just relax, this will get corrected over next few months. Over these months, try to be as active as possible and have controlled diet. Your weight will reduce over time, and this hormonal imbalance will get corrected. All the best.

So, kindly assist me to gain weight.","Doctor":"Hello. To gain weight in a healthy way, you need to build muscle; I advise you to indulge in regular physical activity and a healthy diet pattern. For a healthy diet, do not start eating oily food or junk food to gain weight, because that would only lead to a gain in fat and lead to health problems, like high cholesterol and heart disease. For a healthy diet, increase the intake of protein in the form of sprouts, nuts, egg white and lean meats like fish and chicken. Follow up your workouts by drinking a whey protein supplement within 10 minutes of completing your workout. Instead of three major meals in a day, divide it into small meals every two hours. That makes it 8 to 12 small meals in a day. For physical exercise, do 10 minutes cardio followed by strength training. Start off by lifting lighter weights. Listen to your body, and when it allows you, slowly move on to heavier weights. You can hire a qualified trainer to help you get results faster, and also guide you to do your exercises correctly. Improper posture and breathing pattern during exercise can lead to injury. Before you start any exercise program, visit a doctor for a proper physical examination, to understand if the exercise suits you and to prevent injury. A good eight-hour sleep and eating meals right on time are very important. Having said this, I would like to say that everybody is born beautiful, inside and out. Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.

It is suggestive of a fibroadenoma which is a very common and mostly harmless condition. It occurs as a result of some hormonal changes during the course of development of the breast.

I feed him mother's milk only till now. By next month I need to join my job. So this month I want to start other foods. Which food can I give to him?","Doctor":"Hi. As your baby reached five months, great that you only gave exclusive breastfeed. Now once he approaches six months you can start giving weaning diet. All homemade stuff along with breastfeeding until 2-year of age. It is always better to introduce baby with rice potato first as they are gluten-free and gradually built-up to multi cereal diet like grilled thick dal, mashed banana, mashed dal, mashed roti, bread, biscuit mixed in sweetened undiluted milk, cheeku, mango, and papaya as snacks. Basically our aim is to give small energy dense feeds at frequent intervals. You can add ghee or oil to make it more energy dense. Until 6-12 months keep frequency three to four times at least per day if breastfed. Always make the baby sit on your lap and then feed and maintain all the hygiene and clean your hands before preparing food and while feeding. Avoid all packed food."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Also, low hemoglobin can cause shortness of breath.Now, firstly, after how much exertion he gets shortness of breath? Is this shortness occurs only during a particular time like in the morning? Are there any symptoms other than shortness of breath like wheezing, whistle like sound during shortness of breath? How this shortness of breath begins? Since when is this happening? Does this happen in every winter? So, in short, tell me some more details about shortness of breath as there are numerous causes for shortness of breath. Also, tell what possibilities were kept by your physician? The common cause of shortness of breath is asthma and heart problems where ECG (electrocardiography) can be normal many a times and low hemoglobin. So, since his ECG is normal, the next step is echocardiography. Echo will complete the cardiac evaluation, and we can be assured regarding the cardiac cause. So, get back with some information.

After six Oxidil injections, the pus comes out and the red area decreases. Now pus does not come and we are using a bandage on it. Oxidil was stopped now and after about one week pus comes again today and the red area is about 1.5 square inches. The area below that red is hard. What do you suggest?

According to the history you have provided I believe she has developed injection site abscess though it is not uncommon in elderly people it can happen. Your doctor has started her on a single antibiotic injection Oxidil (Ceftriaxone) but it is my opinion that it is better for her to undergo incision and drainage procedure. It is a small procedure once wound is opened she will have immediate relief following by antibiotics. If she has no other conditions such as diabetes her wound should heal within a week or two. If you continue to treat her only with antibiotics (Oxidil) I believe it will not subside completely and it will reoccur. She should have also been given injection Metronidazole iv thrice a day if pus is present. If you send a picture of the wound site I can comment further.

I have been experiencing muscle spasms and pain in the back, neck, and leg since 10 years intermittently. I am currently undergoing physical therapy and chiropractic. However, I wanted to consult from a naturopathic perspective on what can be the root cause of these problems. I have undergone medical tests, blood test and urine test. Everything indicates normal parameters. Body weight and height ratio is normal as well. I do moderate or light exercises and consume healthy diet and multivitamin. However, I have been plagued by muscle sprains or spasms. Sometimes on feet or leg and other times on back or neck. I am looking for a solution to this problem.","Doctor":"Hi. I looked at your laboratory report, and that is absolutely within the normal range (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I wonder whether your occupation or daily activities cause more stress to your neck and back muscles. If so, you may reduce giving stress by that activities. For example, if you sit and work on laptop continuously, neck muscle get stressed. In that case, relax neck in between. You may take help from physiotherapist to relax those muscles. The other chance is chair and bed. You need to maintain the straight back spine while sitting and sleeping. Sitting straight (no bending the back forward) is important. Choose a chair that makes your spine erect and sit. Keep the neck straight. Even people having a belly, the spine bends to produce back pain. If your back is already not straight, then use pillow support while sitting. While sleeping, please make sure the bed is not having the cushion effect to make pits against your back. It should be the flat and hard, which will maintain the natural spine alignment/posture. Avoid pillow to head. Raising head by pillow will cause more stretch-stress to neck muscles. Keep small round pillow around the neck that needs support. You may also take a small towel to roll and keep under the neck, at any cost the head should not be raised. This is how you can prevent neck, hand and back pain associated with irregular posture. Yoga also helps in relieving back and neck muscle stress. Before going to bed, you can apply aromatic oils or herbal pain relieving oils to back and neck. Do self-massage with hands. Then apply hot water to it. This heat application at night will prevent morning stiffness or pain. Each joint is capable of moving in different direction, but in day-to-day life we do limited movements. If you start the yoga practice, that enables all joints to be moved in all possible directions, thus reduce the pain due to non-using the joint. The next possibility is cervical and lumbar spine degeneration, that leads to local structural alteration which will compress the nerves to cause pain. If any issues with intervertebral discs (bulging, prolapse or inflammation), that also compress the nerves to cause pain. These can be diagnosed by X-ray or CT scan. If you consult an orthopedic physician, they will diagnose. If this is the cause of your pain, then physiotherapist can give appropriate therapy.

First of all, I like to inform you that there are no medications available for penis enlargement. This is only the marketing of bogus products and till date, there is no product discovered which can increase the penis size. The only approved option for enlargement of the penis is a surgical procedure. The surgical procedure is indicated when there is a condition called micropenis (less than 2 inches). With surgical correction, the size of the penis can be increased to the required size with little complications. I also take this opportunity to inform you that size of the penis have little relevance when it comes to sexual pleasure. As per the anatomical details of female, any penis which is larger than 3 inches can give required sexual pleasure.

As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Now after a week, wounds are almost normal and nose stitches are going to be removed tomorrow, but there are dark stitch marks on her nose skin which has totally changed the face shape of our child now. How can stich marks permanently be removed from her nose to restore actual previous shape? What is the treatment name of this case? Which doctor or specialist should we consult for the said treatment? Please guide.","Doctor":"Hi. Sorry to hear about the injury to your child. These injuries lead to permanent scarring if not properly stitched at the initial. Kindly attach the photo because I have to see whether the bone part is deformed or the cartilage (the front part) is deformed. If deformity is permanent it can be later mended by a plastic surgeon so for that, you have to consult a plastic surgeon later on. For darkening or minors scar marks I will advise you to use sunscreen like calamine lotion during the daytime. Vaniza gel (Polysiloxane and Silicone dioxide) twice daily over the lesions. Darkening do recover with time and scars also recover with time but if there is disfiguration of the bone of the cartilage they cannot be cured without intervention by a plastic surgeon.

I am in good health and take 1 mg of Synthroid daily. When I go to the doctor's office my BP goes sky high. At home, it is around 120/70. I went to the doctor last Monday. Just before leaving for the appointment at home it was 140/80. At the appointment, it was 180/90, and the pulse was 123. I got home an hour later. It was 120/75 again. I have a great fear of high BP since I was a child. At my last appoinment, I took Xanax 37.5. It is the first time ever I have taken any meds like that hoping that would calm me down. I guess it did not work. I am so worried that that high number will kill me. I am so tired of worrying about it.","Doctor":"Hello. These blood pressure spikes related to white coat syndrome are not dangerous and do not cause any permanent damage to your heart or blood vessels. They are caused by the anxiety when consulting with your doctor.  These spikes do not need to be treated. There is no need for any treatment, as they do not impose you to any increased cardiovascular risk.

All your reports are normal (attachment removed to protect patient identity) except CRP (c-reactive protein). It is a marker of inflammation in the body. It indicates that some damage is going on in the body and your case it is because of smoking. It also indicates that you are at a higher risk of cardiac disease, so now the priority for you is to cut on smoking and then stop gradually. The cramp is probably due to gastritis and acidity. CRP does not cause cramps. You can get prescribed by your doctor tablet Pantoprazole 40 mg before breakfast once a day for two weeks. Avoid fatty, oily food and a high-calorie diet.

Started with constant sneezing followed by a runny nose, then nose cleared and sneezing stopped but felt an uneasiness in palate and throat turned sore, getting worse with time and then persistent coughing. I consulted my general practitioner on the fourth or fifth day who prescribed some medications. I started feeling better after the seventh day and the throat improved. But almost the next day onwards I started feeling worse again but this time it was not sore throat or a runny nose exactly, just felt the mucous inside throat all the time. Never felt feverish as such or found raised body temperature (by touching only) and experienced mild body ache here and there. Nevertheless, around 1 month after this resolved totally as said above, since yesterday I have started feeling same common cold symptoms, runny nose (not sneezing or coughing much though) with uneasiness in the palate, no raised body temperature but little feverish with mild body ache here and there.In both the aforesaid cases I had taken a Cetirizine tablet on the same day (but little later in the day) the symptoms started. But the medicine did not work. However, previously whenever I experienced a runny nose and constant sneezing, one Cetirizine tablet helped.In fact, it resolved the problem. Could you please share your opinion on this, please, why the cetirizine did not work? Secondly, I may have had (but I am not sure at all) a possible HIV exposure around 10 months ago. I did not get tested. I have consulted few doctors online who said that the chances of HIV infection is quite less. Assuming I may have HIV, could it be the reason why the cetirizine did not work? I wish to mention here that I had high blood pressure for which I take medicines and last month when I checked, it was under control.","Doctor":"Hi. Firstly, I do not think it has any relation with HIV status and you should not worry about it. It seems you are quite worried and unconvinced about HIV status. So, I would advise you to get yourself checked. It will help in relieving your anxiety and fear. Unresponsiveness to Cetirizine is likely due to development of tolerance which means some medicine becomes less efficacious if taken repeatedly, which recovers within few months of a drug-free interval. It is not at all related to HIV. You appear to have another viral infection now and I would suggest Tablet Paracetamol 500 mg whenever needed for your body aches, uneasiness and fever if develops. Also, instead of Cetirizine, you can have Tablet Allegra (Fexofenadine hydrochloride) 60 mg twice a day up to two to three days. Its similar to Cetirizine. If you don't respond in 3-4 days then you will need antibiotics as well. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicines with their consent. You keep on monitoring blood pressure and it should be less than 140/90 mmHg. It is not related to your current illness.

I have tried to maintain good personal hygiene with daily change of undergarments to no avail. Over time it returns and the patches only get bigger and leaves the skin discolored. I have also been given Fluconazole. Could you please recommend some form of treatment to get rid of it completely? I am currently on Thyronorm and Ciplar-LA 40. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Recurrence of tinea is most commonly due to either incomplete treatment or wrong medication most commonly the combination of a topical steroid with a topical antifungal e.g Candid-B (Beclometasone Topical and Clotrimazole Topical) or other similar preparations. Topical steroids and antifungal combination creams though more effective in providing symptomatic relief from itching, actually prolonging the infection which manifests as clinical recurrence as soon as the treatment is stopped. Therefore, you should use a plain topical antifungal like Lulifin cream (Luliconazole) 1% creamor Onabet cream (Sertaconazole) 2% cream twice daily for five to six weeks rather than using a combination cream that contains a topical steroid and topical antifungal. In addition to this, I also suggest you take a different oral antifungal like tablet Zimig (Terbinafine) 250 mg once a day for five to six weeks. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicine.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

He gave me Azee 250 mg and one multivitamin for five days and I have taken it till 30th. From that day I am doing basic gargling and taking milk with pepper and haldi in the night. But yesterday I got the message that whoever visited one mall from the date 10th -17th and having any symptoms of Covid-19 should seek medical support. I visited that mall on 12th and after that, I got throat pain but it is already 22 days since I visited that mall and almost 10 days I have this throat pain. Should I consider this throat pain as a symptom? I do not have any temperature or any other problem. I called the helpline and told them that I visited the mall on 12th March but not that particular shop and told me about my current situation and the person told me to take the Azee tablet for two more days if I still have mild throat pain. I want to know since it is already 22 days I visited the mall and also my throat pain is already there for almost 10 days, do I need to worry about anything? I am very scared and panicked after seeing that news. Please help me with your suggestion.","Doctor":"Hi. Is there any cough or breathing difficulty or wheezing?

First, she started off with a protected blowjob followed by protected sex which lasted no more than 30 seconds.My concern is that three to four hours prior to sex, I shaved my penis and got a tiny cut on the shaft. Although during the entire activity I made sure that the cut was covered with the condom, but still wanted to check if this was a risk situation. I am worrying a lot. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I have noted your concern. Protected sex is safe as far as risk of HIV is concerned. However, there is still a risk of genital herpes, HPV infection or warts as a condom does not cover the entire penis and there is some uncovered skin at the base of the penis for a skin to skin contact. If the cut was covered, it obviously does not increase the risk. Even if it was exposed, then HIV is still not a risk as it has to be a fresh actively bleeding cut for the virus to pass through. A paper thin cut that is a few hours old is self-sealing. Regards. For more information consult an HIV AIDS specialist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,My daughter is 13 years old. For the medical record, she is yet to experience menarche. She is intelligent, cheerful, very creative, bubbly and incredibly empathetic child. I believe she is the best thing ever happened to us. I have a concern about her. She is very sensitive and cries at the first instance of disappointment. Even as a baby, she has always been a cry baby and I thought this would change as she grows. Now that she is in her teens, she is becoming hypersensitive to criticisms, insults and even when her friends make fun of her. She yearns for attention. She is slightly on the plumper side, so she is very conscious when someone comments about her body and cries for hours, especially when her friends or boys do it. She has also got on to the habit of blaming others for every failure of hers.Initially, I attributed the entire thing to hormonal changes and adolescence. But, this is affecting her too much. I cannot see her losing confidence. My fear is if she continues like this, she might lose confidence and added to it, might never be an independent and confident woman. I have seen this trait of being hypersensitive to anything in my mother. Initially, I thought she had taken it from my mom. But now, I feel I have to step in and change course for her good. I am spending more time with her. She is pretty open to me to the extent even about the boy who has a crush on her or even her physical changes, despite me being her father. I am trying to find a way to make her more confident, take comments or bullying or criticism in the correct perspective, to make her bold to face the world all alone.

I have never seen this with an ulcer.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen the pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You are having an ulcer on the posterior tonsillar pillar. It looks like a benign ulcer. The protocol is medicines must be given for the ulcer to heal. If the ulcer persists in spite of medication, a biopsy must be taken from the ulcer margin.

Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Medicine to reduce weight is never recommended especially if you are breastfeeding until and unless the weight is causing problems to maintain good health. Diet and exercise are best. Fresh fruits, nutritious diet, sprouts are best. Avoid junk and fast food and oily food. Exercise in any form like running, skipping, jogging, aerobics, yoga to keep yourself active can help.

Thereafter, there were some drops of blood when I passed stool. My stool was slightly covered in blood too. I cleansed my anus with water and wiped it. Then, there was no sign of blood.","Doctor":"Hi. From what you mentioned, you have an anal fissure which is a cut injury in the anal canal. Most commonly due to constipation and hard stools. They cause severe pain during and after bowel motion (may last for hours). If not treated appropriately, it could become chronic with recurrent pain and bleeding in the future. My advice would be to treat constipation with laxatives and stool softners and local GTN (Nitroglycerin) will be helpful. The other possible cause is bleeding piles. For further advice, I highly recommend that you follow up in order to set the appropriate management plan.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have been trying to treat it back and forth since the medicines being prescribed are so expensive. Every time I see my skin healed I stop the medication. The fungal infection I first had was ringworm. Recently, my infection started acting up again, then I did the same routine taking medication and putting cream (but this time my doctor told me to use vinegar instead cause my skin was not healing well and instead make it worst), but this time I plan on finishing the medication so that I will finally be gone for good. The couple of weeks I have my skin treated well and it was healing just right until this quarantine happened. My skin was still good the first week of the quarantine then the second week my grandma showed me some vitamin D that I believe would be good since it is just vitamin D, but after a few days my skin started showing some bumps in arms also feet. They are very small bumps but also so itchy, I am still taking the same medicine prescribed to but why did bumps like this start showing up?

The cream I used to use Clotrimazole to now just pure vinegar. I drink apple cider every morning. Use a sulfur soap. These are all prescribed by my doctor.","Doctor":"Hi. Fungal infections are very difficult to treat and your case is resistant fungal infection. In such cases, I give Itraconazole as last resort only some patient respond to Itraconazole some patient respond to Terbinafine and in some both have to be given. Take Ketoconazole bath soap. Wash your clothes undergarments especially daily dry them in Sun. Wear clothes after drying the body only after drying your body properly. Avoid sweating and moist conditions keep your room dry and well ventilated. Do not wear much clothes during the night so that is sweating may promote the growth of fungus. Keep your body clean. The bumps are actually bacterial infection not fungal. l do not use any over the counter steroid in ever they also increase fungal infection follow the following treatment given below and revert me back after three weeks. Take tablet Terbinaforce 250 mg twice daily after meals for three weeks, Terbinafine cream twice daily for three weeks, tablet Citizen once daily.

After feeling around, I then noticed that the testicle is normal size. There is just some excess fluid around my right testicle.

He noticed the fluid and did some inspection along with his assistant and felt was around and did not feel any lumps, bumps, or swelling of the testicles themselves. Regardless, he went ahead and referred me to a urologist. The fluid has remained pretty consistent since I noticed. I have some time before I visit the urologist, but my GP did not seem to be concerned. Do you have any idea on what this could be? Is there any way this could be from testicular cancer? Currently, I am on anti-anxiety medicine Lexapro 10 mg. I had my complete blood count done a month ago and everything was normal.","Doctor":"Hello. Relax and do not worry. If you or GP do not feel any lump from testis, then it is not likely to be testis cancer. So, I feel it would be a simple hydrocele. So, do not worry at all. Yes, show to the urologist as he will advise you an ultrasound of scrotum to diagnose 100 percent. Till then relax and enjoy.

I recently did a test at home measuring my blood pressure before and after exercise using an Omron M3 comfort blood pressure monitor. In each case, I did for two minutes of step-ups, walking up and down two steps for that period of time. My blood pressure before exercising was 114/84 mmHg, and my heart rate was 71. Afterwards, I was sweating lightly and my heart was pounding. My blood pressure was 153/94 mmHg and my heart rate was 88. Two minutes after resting, my blood pressure was 145/108 mmHg, and my heart rate was 88. Two minutes after that, my blood pressure was 136/85 mmHg and my heart rate was 81. I am worried about the rise in my diastolic blood pressure immediately after exercise, and especially the fact that it seemed to continue to rise before dropping back. I should also say that I have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and as a result, I recently had two resting electrocardiography, blood work, a cholesterol test, and a blood sugar test, all of which have come back normal. Many thanks.","Doctor":"Hi. Blood pressure is a dynamic thing. It will always vary in relation to activity, stress, time of the day, and physical status.

She always had a deep voice and body hairs on her chest and stomach. She was taking birth control pills two months ago because of her irregular periods. Routine blood test for being on birth control revealed the results above. Her cholesterol and lipids are high as well. She is not overweight and she has a healthy diet. My concern is why there is a high level of DHEA sulfate and what does it mean?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query about your daughter. It appears that your daughter has irregular menses and hirsutism which is mostly due to polycystic ovarian disease. DHEA means dehydroepiandrosterone. The levels are usually raised in two conditions: If the testosterone levels are normal as in your daughter’s case, then this rise is due to polycystic ovarian disease and congenital adrenal hyperplasia is ruled out.

This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have been taking Xarelto for about a year-and-a-half due to a pulmonary embolism that I had. They were very small. I have done every test including the factor 5 and the conclusion was my constant driving. My biggest fear is obviously getting another blood clot which I know you can get one while taking Xarelto. Obviously, every ache and pain I think that I have another one. Sometimes, I do get mild cramping in my legs but it comes and goes. My biggest question is if I was to get another blood clot. Is basically the only thing that can be done is just continuing to take Xarelto?","Doctor":"Hello. Xarelto is the brand name for the generic drug Rivaroxaban. It blocks the activity of certain clotting factors in the blood. It is used to prevent or treat deep vein thrombosis in which blood clots form in the deep veins of the legs. This can lead to pulmonary embolism in certain cases as in yours and can be fatal. Your current medication comprising of Xarelto daily is a form of prophylaxis to prevent the occurrence of deep vein thrombosis. The dose is lower than that when you are being treated for deep vein thrombosis. There are other anticoagulants which can be used but Xarelto is preferred. If you were to get another episode of deep vein thrombosis, the treatment would differ. Deep vein thrombosis is associated with prolonged periods of inactivity, inherited clotting disorders, surgery, and certain cancers. Since in your case it is due to driving for prolonged periods, you could reduce that and try and walk around every 15 to 20 minutes. If you smoke, then you should stop that as well. Thank you.

We can determine its direction by inserting the probe. Sometimes it is healed with proper medications and changed lifestyle. But if its root (fibrosed tissues) remain inside the sinuses, then it recurs due to changes in food habits and lifestyles. Ksharasutra ligation treatment is the best option to treat it.

Using a meter he was able to demonstrate current flows in my mouth which are the equivalent of electrolysis. Have concerns about mercury from amalgam been debunked?","Doctor":"Hello. Well, amalgam carries mercury which is a key product to make filling for the mouth. Electrolysis happens and mercury is not healthy for oral health and general health too. We use amalgam as it has a good strength and it is one of the oldest material used for filling in dentistry. Nowadays, amalgam is somewhat replaced by composite. Amalgam caries silver and mercury. Silver as it is a metal, it forms electrolysis in the mouth when it comes in contact with saliva. Removing all amalgam restoration is a good choice and it will help you to prevent poisoning.

DVT or deep vein thrombosis is a condition where blood clot accumulates in lower limb veins due to prolonged bedridden state, reduced physical activity, after a major surgery or fracture of bones. These blood clots can often dislodge and go through the right heart to block the pulmonary artery. This condition is known as pulmonary embolism and can cause right ventricular cardiac dysfunction.

As her period was irregular and the last one was two months ago, it is a bit difficult to predict the chances of pregnancy quite surely. However, I-pill is a very effective medicine to prevent pregnancy.  So, considering her irregular period and bleeding, do a pregnancy test first after 14 days of intercourse.

I am afraid it might be a false negative since it was a few years ago. May I know should I test for Treponemal test such as TPPA or FTA-ABS to rule out the false negative by VDRL after three years test, I worry it might false negative by VDRL? The negative VDRL test was one month ago and possible exposure was three years ago. Does this mean the person does not have active syphilis infection? Does this also mean it would not proceed to latent or tertiary syphilis that will damage the body such as paralysis, numbness, gradual blindness and dementia?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, sometimes many years after an infection with Treponema pallidum, VDRL may turn negative. TPHA (Treponema pallidum hemagglutination) or FTA ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test) would be confirmatory in that case. You may take this test. Syphilis may slowly progress to the tertiary stage with neurological involvement. CSF VDRL is more diagnostic rather than serum VDRL in case of neurological involvement.

I would like to request your kind review for some of her recent symptoms as well, which I try to summarize below along with brief history. Early this year, she had a fever (100 to 101 F) with cold and was on Calpol 650 and Cetirizine for a few days. One morning, right after breakfast, while sitting on a chair, she started feeling reeling of the head along with darkness in both eyes, which resolved on its own after she went to bed and laid down. The same evening, when the doctor visited her for fever, her BP was 130/80 (left arm - sitting position) with pulse 102. She also had a left-sided headache, which took two to three days to settle down along with Calpol 650. Two months later - This time she was too worried about her son's health and recovery and night sleep was affected for a couple of days. She herself was also not too well due to stomach issues, antibiotic, gastritis, lack of appetite, etc. One morning, she started having running nose along with some amount of sneezing, for which she had taken a couple of Cetirizine tablets that day. The next day, right after lunch, while being in the sitting position itself and talking about her son's health issues, suddenly she reported to feel reeling of the head along with darkness in both eyes, followed by she was bent towards her left with left-hand palm shaking for 10 to 15 sec and was almost about to fall down, which however did not happen with help from others. We felt for next 5 minutes or so she was in an altered consciousness, staring at something silently, although the rest of us got extremely anxious. When we tried to speak to her, she was initially making some strange sounds, followed by normal words in hoarse voice and after that she started talking normally. However, she was crying and worrying about her son's health, although my wife was trying to console her. Later she mentioned not to have any memory of the whole incident, except the last part of consolation from my wife. She was back in normal activities in next 10 minutes, but reported to feel too tired and sleepy for at least next two weeks. As per doctor's appointment, I took her to our medicine doctor after five to six days of the incident, who classified this as a case of viral infection, noted BP 118/82 (right arm - sleeping position) and 'no H/O convulsion'. After a week of the incident, she had four times motion (not loose motion although) on an evening and started feeling headache after that. On the next morning, she reported feeling heaviness in legs as well as the head, which was, in fact, disturbing her daily activities. When we talked to the doctor, he advised testing serum sodium (138.4) and potassium (3.72) levels, which were normal. With rest, she improved in the evening and was able to get back into regular routine. In the following few months she had only one instance of reeling of head which happened in the morning and got cured on its own. She also had fever with cold sometime in the middle of the year, which caused her a left-sided headache, which also lasted for three to four days in spite of taking Calpol 650. Most of her BP readings during this period were around 110/80 (left arm - sitting position) and 120/72 (right arm - sleeping position), which prompted the doctor to change BP medicine to Stamlo 2.5 mg. However, due to slight swelling in feet after a month, it was changed back to Olmezest 20 mg. Around two months ago, some of her previous issues such as gastritis, constipation, three-four times of motion resumed back. One day she woke up pretty early (4.30 AM) and felt a significant amount of reeling of the head, which lasted almost 10 minutes, before settling on its own. She also had a left-sided headache, which again took three days to settle down, even after taking Calpol 650. She visited the doctor within next few days, who noted BP 132/82 (right arm - sleeping position) and mentioned the headache symptoms are clinically similar a migraine. The doctor suggested taking Olmezest 20 mg twice daily as her BP seemed a little higher as compared to the previous readings. He also advised for CT scan and Holter monitor for 24 hours, in case there are recurrences of reeling of head, seizure or presyncope. I have also uploaded her past six months of test reports for your kind review. She also started feeling mild to moderate pain in the waist joint (middle portion) since past one month, but I am not sure if that is relevant to our current discussion. What do you feel about the possible cause of these incidents? Was there really a possibility of stroke, seizure or syncope, or, are these some warning signs? What should be our next step from here on? As people at home are really scared hearing CT scan or Holter, is there anything else we could do to rule out such possibilities?","Doctor":"Hello. It is difficult to comment if the episodes are solely syncope/ fainting spell due to orthostatic hypotension or abnormal heart rhythm. I agree with Holter monitoring. I would also, recommend EEG study for one hour to make sure we are not dealing with seizures. Her hemoglobin is low and needs further workup regarding the cause. Low hemoglobin or anemia can make her more susceptible to syncope episodes. I hope this helps.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours.

The symptoms mentioned by you could be due to other medical conditions not related to STDs, like hypertension, diabetes, and thyroid related disorder or vitamin B complex deficiency.

Today I could see tiny rashes on my genitals. I tested again for HIV yesterday and it came as non-reactive. Do I need to test again for STD? Could you please help me with this?","Doctor":"Hello. I have noted your concern and I have viewed the attachments (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Receiving unprotected oral sex though much less of a risk as compared to unprotected vaginal or anal sex, is still not entirely safe. There is a possibility of acquiring herpes simplex infection, gonorrhea and chlamydia through oral sex though HIV has a negligible risk unless the person performing oral sex has oral sores or bleeding gums. As far as testing is concerned HIV has been convincingly ruled out in you at six weeks. Even CDC says a negative HIV combo test (antibody and P24 antigen test) is conclusive at six weeks. Though your HSV, IgG, and IgM are negative at six weeks a 12 to 16-week negative HSV, IgG would be more reliable as IgG may sometimes appear later. A negative IgM is not very reliable in ruling out HSV as it is short lasting even though it appears quite early. Chlamydia has been adequately ruled out. Gonorrhea is mostly symptomatic in males. So, if you still do not have any symptoms of gonococcal urethritis like pus discharge from the urethra and burning on micturition, it suggests that you do not have gonorrhea. So to summarize, you just need to repeat HSV IgG at 12 to 16 weeks. Rest all the STDs have been ruled out. HCV (hepatitis C) and HBV (hepatitis B) is not a risk through oral sex. Regards.

Your expected body weight is between 52 to 57 kg which I know is impossible. But try to reduce at least four to five kilograms. Hope the thyroid hormone and Prolactin hormone abnormalities have been ruled out. As your problem is of secondary infertility, the first thing to do is to confirm the fallopian tube patency. This is the tube where the egg meets the sperm to form an embryo. It can never be seen on the scan. You will have to do an HSG (hysterosalpingogram) or laparoscopy. Once confirmed as patent, your chances of pregnancy will be very high. Your doctor can plan for ovulation induction with hormonal tablets and injections.

This has fluctuated from time to time. Last year, I was referred to a hematologist as my hemoglobin was high and my platelet count was low. With a number of tests over time, including a bone marrow, there was no indication of cancer. At that time, I smoked one cigarette a day and although my usage was light, I thought that it might have raised my hemoglobin so I stopped the smoking for a number of months. About six months later, I started smoking cigarettes that were nicotine free. Although the usage limited to one a day, I am concerned that even this light usage might be causing my hemoglobin count to rise. So, my question is do you think that this smoking of one nicotine-free cigarette a day could be causing my hemoglobin count to rise? My current medications are vitamin supplements, Apixaban 5 mg two times daily, Blast dietary Supplement, Phenylalanine 600 mg one times daily, CoQ10 300 mg one time daily, Fish Oil 1000 mg [300 mg Omega-3] two times daily, Glucosamine HCL 1500 mg with MSM 1500 mg two times daily, Latanoprost 0.005 % Ophthalmic Solution one time daily, Levothyroxine 50 mcg one time daily, Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg one time daily, Multivitamins one time daily, Mucinex DM two times daily, Niacin 1000 mg one time daily, Palmetto Guard one time daily, Simvastatin 40 mg one time daily, Timolol Maleate 0.5 % Ophthalmic Solution one time daily, and Vitamin D3 2000IU one time daily. I have had the following lab tests and the results are as follows: Hemoglobin is 17.7 H, 13.2 - 17.1 g/dL, hematocrit 51.0 H, 38.5 - 50.0%. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello. I have reviewed your complaints and your current medications. From that, I could deduce that you are on medication for hypothyroidism, hypertension, and glaucoma with additional multivitamins. Also, your testosterone levels are slightly elevated. Your elevated hemoglobin levels could be due to many factors which in your case include smoking, hypothyroidism, elevated testosterone and your increased age. All these factors can contribute to elevated hemoglobin levels. Now coming to the question of nicotine-free cigarettes: They have been found to be harmful even if they do not contain tobacco. Any cigarette-like product which requires the user to inhale smoke, the byproduct of combustion, is still subject to unsafe quantities of tar and carbon monoxide. These chemicals lead to lung cancer, mouth cancers, and esophageal cancers. The smoke causes low oxygen levels in the blood which can lead to increase in the hemoglobin level. So I suggest that you quit smoking altogether. You did it for six months and I am sure you can do it for the rest of your life.

I do not know the health status of that lady. After 30 days of exposure, I got fever and body pain and I went to the hospital for treatment. He suggested checking a Widal test and a urine test. The results came as typhoid and I had taken medicines for that too and for stomach pain. Three courses of antibiotics have been taken. The stomach upset was the main problem that time. I am normal now. After one month, I had white plaques like formations on the tongue and one side of the tongue color also slightly changed. I consulted a dentist and he told me the tongue was normal. I went for HIV tests as below:HIV rapid test after 40 days - negative HIV Combo test after 70 days - negativeHIV CD4 test after 70 days - normal HIV Duo test after 84 days - negative HIV rapid test after 88 days - negativeSTD full test after 88 days - all negativeHIV ELISA test after 110 days - negative unit as 0.06 HIV ELISA test after 155 days - negative unit as 0.07My doubt is I have many symptoms like a sore throat with red patches, white tongue, body ache, muscle ache, white dot on the head like itching. I sometimes have a burning sensation. These symptoms have been there for three months. I am wondering it could be due to the exposure. Mostly, I have consulted with a general physician for muscle ache and body ache. I feel like my neck muscles have reduced a little bit.My doubt is whether I have been infected with HIV? My recent test is HIV antibody test at 155 days from my exposure being negative. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello. Your screening tests have convincingly ruled out HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). Perhaps you have oral thrush which may have started because of repeated courses of oral antibiotics. I suggest you use a topical antifungal like Clotrimazole mouth paint. In addition, I also suggest you take an oral antifungal like tablet Fluconazole 50 mg once a day for two weeks.

I have had a mild burning sensation in the middle of the chest for the past few days and along with slight irritation in my throat. I also sometimes feel bloated and have slightly more than normal amount of burps. I have no cough or fever (checking temperature on a daily basis and highest is 98.6ºC).","Doctor":"Hello. Based on your history and symptoms you may be having gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). If the acid goes up to the throat area, it might cause thick mucus. In this case, this is classified as laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPR). You would need to take a different medication. I recommend you take Omeprazole 40 mg one tablet 30 minutes before breakfast for two to three weeks. I would also recommend you avoid oily, fatty, spicy, and dairy food. Avoid alcoholic, carbonated, and caffeinated drinks. Avoid smoking and avoid lying down within one hour after eating. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Is it healthy to take Anuloma from time to time?","Doctor":"Hi. There are several causes of constipation and irregular bowel movements like lack of exercises and physical work, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, taking more oily, fried junk foods, consuming alcohol and smoking habits, etc. Sometimes, it is due to neurological issues. Drinking lots of water stimulate bowel movement which facilitates motion. You can take Anuloma (Senna) tablets. It is a good laxative medicine, but along with this, you should change your food habits and lifestyles. Here are some useful tips which help you to improve your concern: You should take some ayurveda medicines too along with your change in lifestyle like Panchasakar Churna (Svarna Patri, Sunthi, Misreya) 3 gm twice a day with warm water after meals, Arogyavardhini Vati (shudha Mercury, shudha Gandhak, shudha Gaggul) one tablet twice a day with warm water after meals, Abhayaristam (Abhaya) 15 ml twice a day with the equal amount of water after meals.

It looks like you have a huge epithelial defect due to trauma caused by contact lenses. But the possibility of infection can only be ruled out by examining your eye.

Left anterior fascicular block is always associated with left axis deviation and caused by either hypertension, myocardial infarction or idiopathic fibrosis.

She gave me oral sex and then we had vaginal sex. I did not touch her vagina with my fingers.

Immediately after sex, she wiped me down toward the tip of my penis. I then went to the bathroom and urinated. Now, I am scared that I caught something. All this happened about 90 minutes ago.

Her expected date for the period was 6th this month but a doctor suggested she should wait till 15th. She started with an odorless vaginal discharge and has reduced since but is yet to have her periods. She has no common symptoms of pregnancy but is under tremendous stress. What would you suggest?","Doctor":"Hello. The bleeding that she had from 26th to the 31st, post Unwanted-72 intake was the withdrawal bleed or her menses which got initiated as per the schedule of emergency pill intake. So, now her next bleeding or menses would only be after a month post 31st, that is by 2nd or 3rd next month onwards. In some cases, this may be delayed by a further one or two weeks as it is a known side effect of Unwanted-72 to delay natural menses for the next one or two cycles. So, pregnancy is unlikely as she had a withdrawal bleed. However, if you wish to confirm as well, then get a urine pregnancy test done. Regards.

In a day, 20 to 25 times the pain is repeated. I consulted a neurologist here in my hometown. He suggested a CT scan, EEG, CBC, and ophthalmologist and psychologist opinion. All the reports are normal but today she does not feel better. Please advice. What is the main problem and what can I do?","Doctor":"Hello. I have checked the attached reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). From what you mentioned, I suspect that your sister has a migraine headache. Is there nausea or photophobia (avoiding lights)? A migraine causes severe pulsating headache usually on one side and lasts few minutes up to few hours. She should receive chronic treatment if there are repeated attacks. When was her first attack? The other possible cause is glaucoma (high eye pressure). I suggest Paracetamol 1000 mg tablet. If unsuccessful to abort the headache, Sumatriptan should be tried. Consult a specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I am not sure if it was a third or fourth generation test. I tested negative with a fourth generation test four months back because I thought I might be having some symptoms. And I remembered the flu-like illness about six months after exposure. I weighed 204 kg three months back and now I weigh 191 kg. I have worried a lot (pacing the floor, sleep loss) for past five months, took Paxil, and realized my worry could account for some weight loss. Shortly, after the test, I had the following symptoms:  I started having a small patch of 8 to 10 pinpoint sized pink-light red dots under the skin of my left wrist that have been there for two to three weeks. I also had a smooth, flat spot about 3/8 inch in diameter that appeared on the back of my right hand about a week ago, that has now faded to a pinkish brown. I have read about Kaposi sarcoma being a definer of AIDS, but do not understand how that could happen with a non-reactive fourth generation test four months back. Three months back, I had sinus type headaches multiple times that would sometimes be severe. After three rounds of antibiotics and a CT scan two months back that showed shadowing in a sinus, my ENT doctor just told me this week that there is something in my sphenoid sinus. He is treating it with a rinse for inflammation for three weeks before I see him again. I have had blood in my mucous from my nose for past three months. It dries out in my nose and causes blood almost every time I pick at it. The ENT doctor said that the lining of my nose had been worn down from this, but did not seem concerned about it. I do mess with it a lot, and blow my nose a lot. My PSA elevated quickly in the last six months, going from 1.2 to 3.5. A biopsy two months back showed an early cancer in one of the 12 regions biopsied. I had a lithotripsy on an 8 mm kidney stone this month and I am still passing dark urine. I was told that I do have several small stones still in each kidney. I have had multiple stones over the years. I have a swelling sensation all the way around my waist down into my groin at times that has been there for about two months, but no noticeable swelling. Several doctors have felt in my abdomen and detected nothing abnormal. A CT scan with no contrast 10 days ago showed no abnormalities other than a little swelling in the right kidney where the 8 mm stone was blocking the passage into the ureter. A CT with contrast five months back was normal except for showing stones. But I have microscopic blood in my urine since then.  My vital signs have consistently been normal for past five months, including temperature, BP and oxygen. I know I am getting old and some of these symptoms happen with age. But it is driving me crazy that so much has happened since my negative fourth generation test which is supposed to detect antibodies may not be conclusive after three to four years of exposure. I had Zoloft 100 mg daily earlier but currently, on Paxil 40 mg and Propranolol 60 mg daily. After nearly four years of exposure and a negative antibody test four months back, would that test have detected antibodies if I were in a stage of HIV or AIDS? Do you think it was conclusive? Or is there another test I should have done? I have read about an HIV RNA test, but it says early detection. I understand that it detects more than the antibodies. What are your thoughts on my next step?","Doctor":"Hi. Your test done before four months is certainly conclusive and final. A three months intervening period/window period between risk exposure and a fourth generation HIV screening test is good enough for it to be considered conclusive. 95 % of those infected with HIV will have detectable antibodies by four weeks and by 12 weeks, or three months 100 % of HIV infected individual will have detectable antibodies. Antibodies once formed will remain detectable by screening tests. In fact, antibody based HIV screening tests are the gold standard tests for the diagnosis of infection whereas an HIV RNA PCR test is more commonly utilized as a measure of response to antiretroviral therapy in HIV AIDS patients rather than as a diagnostic or screening test.

The pain is not intense though, and it does not disrupt my daily activities, though it comes for a few minutes and then goes.

I did urine analysis (sample was taken after sweating from the heat of the sun), the result says crystals of calcium oxalate (+) was found. I took Buscopan, Amoxicillin and Ciprofloxacin. I need your expert opinion on this.","Doctor":"Hello. Relax and do not worry. Yes, it is possible that you may have a stone in the urinary system. Sometimes, stones get missed on ultrasound examination. I suggest you get plain CT scan (without contrast) of abdomen and pelvis region. It will 100 percent rule out the stone in the urinary system. If no stone in CT scan is there, then your pain is musculoskeletal origin.

It will be fine after about three weeks. Then, my throat will start to itch, and I will begin to have trouble talking. Later, I start coughing explosively. Once I get to the coughing phase, my eyes start watering. It looks like I am crying and I will either cough until I throw up mucus or fluid or vomit if I have just eaten, and then I can breathe again. It happens on the bus, at work, and sometimes at night. When I do not have these odd coughing spells, I feel fine. There are no sore throat, vomiting or GI symptoms. Sometimes I will have the sniffles. I hugged a friend at the dance, and I went from fine to immediate coughing in about 5 to 10 seconds. I will have a few weeks of this, and then it will clear up on its own. Last week, this happened about 10 times, and itchy throat spells where I worked on breathing through it. I am always sucking on throat lozenges during these weeks.My total IgE level taken during one of these symptoms filled weeks was 736 ug/L, where reference range is less than 416 ug/L for adults. Medications I was on during testing include Zantac (Ranitidine) just in case it is acid reflux and Ibuprofen for menstrual cramps. They did a skin test this week to try and start figuring things out, and two types of dust mite and something else came back positive. Spirometry is waiting on results. I have never been able to run a mile outside without stopping to catch my breath a few times. I got bronchitis a lot as a kid. It seemed like if I got a cold, it would inevitably move to my lungs before getting better. My GP was hesitant to order the total IgE level because she said it was often falsely positive.

Two days after it happened, I got sick. I have cold and I am scared if this is related to the incident. I want to make sure that there is no chance of any viruses (like HIV) in my body. I just need reassurance","Doctor":"Hi. The risk of infection from needlestick injuries depends on: Diabetics use fine gauge needle and that too for injecting insulin into the skin rather than into a blood vessel. Moreover, the needlestick injury you have mentioned here actually did not prick deep enough, you just touched the needle and I think your chances are minimal if at all.Are you unsure about the HIV status of the patient? If you are sure that the used needle belongs to him and no one else, and if you know the person very well, you may straight away go and tell him/her about the incident and your reason to be anxious and inquire about the person's HIV status. That would be the easiest way. You may get a HIV combo test (antigen and antibody based test) done after 1 month of exposure, for your own peace of mind.

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Does having sex increase estrogen hormone? Will it result in belly fat and sagging breast in women? Is it true or a myth? Please explain.","Doctor":"Hi. All these are false beliefs and let me explain it to you. Whether you have sex or not any lady who puts on weight will have sagging of breast, belly fat, and increase of hormone estrogen. When you have sex, only testosterone hormone is increased in females, which gives a final orgasm or pleasure of sex. Due to the manipulation of the breast during sex repeatedly, the shape of the breast may change, and it will sag. When a lady puts on weight, the typical obesity is called \\"lemon on toothpick\\" appearance. Fat is mainly around thighs, breast (one more reason for sagging breast), waist, lower abdomen or belly and upper arm. The hands ( below elbow) and legs (below knees) will be thin. This fat gets converted in the body to estrogen - the female hormone. You would have seen obese men developing breast, which is the fat converted into estrogen and forming breasts, so also girls at younger age develop periods at the younger age if they are obese. So, sex has nothing to do with any of these features. For further doubts consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a single male, 34 years.

As you said that you have been smoking for five years and now have cough with clear mucus expectoration, it is most likely due to bronchitis. It is very common to have cough if you smoke more than five cigarettes per day. Also, because of cold weather, it gets aggravated and takes longer to heal. So, better is to stop smoking as you did rightly and take a good expectorant like syrup TusQ-X 10 ml (combination of Ambroxol, Guaifenesin, and Terbutaline) three times a day. Continue with salt water gargles and steam. It will help to loosen and liquefy the cough. If there is no relief even after seven days, better get your chest X-ray done from your family doctor and get treated accordingly.

As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have noticed that for three years my blood tests have been on the high levels for WBC. Should I be concerned? I have been in and out and they never call me for a follow up. Maybe I should change the doctor? Also, can Phentermine be the cause of this? I only took it for two days before the blood test. I am a 39-year-old female. I have bone pain, neck pain, dizziness, and hair loss.","Doctor":"Hello. Following is my opinion for your asked question. Your total WBC count and neutrophils are high. Mild increase of immature granulocytes and high count with neutrophilia could be due to infection or inflammation in the body. Your detailed physical examination and investigation should be done to find the underlying cause. For your complaint you can investigate further with ANA (antinuclear antibody) estimation, USG (ultrasound) abdomen, Vitamin D estimation, serum calcium estimation, blood pressure measurement, and blood sugar estimation. Your ear examination also should be done. Antibiotic courses can be prescribed as per the provided report. However, before that physical examination and above investigation can be done. You need to follow up your CBC (complete blood count) with peripheral smear examination report after a few days to check values once again. You can consult a good internal medicine specialist for your examination and investigation accordingly."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis.

There is no scratch on the upper part, no problem in urine passing or bleeding but still paining. What can this be?","Doctor":"Hi. Since there is no external injury as well as internal injury (normal passage of urine) I feel the problem is with muscle damage rather than anything. The simple muscle injury can be dealt with analgesics such as Ibuprofen 400 to 800 mg to be taken two to three times a day. Also, over the next three to four days there is a good chance of recovery from damage, and there is little to worry about it. It is also essential to maintain proper lubrication, and hard penis should not be rubbed over a hard surface as it is risky and may cause more damage.

Some white hyperintensities were found on the MRI. As a result, I had a lumbar puncture. Everything came back normal, no oligoclonal banging was present. However, my IgG synthesis rate appears abnormal. The values are IgG CSF 19.4 mg/dl, albumin CSF 69.2 mg/dl, IgG serum 453 mg/dl, albumin serum 2.3 g/dl and IgG CSF index 1.42.","Doctor":"Hello. The increase of protein (IgG and albumin) production in the LCS (liquide cerebro-spinal) could be related to different chronic neurological disorders like an autoimmune disorder, a chronic infection like Lyme disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), etc. Although the presence of oligoclonal bands has been excluded, MS cannot be excluded (in 20 % of the patients with MS, these bands are not present). As there is a presence of white matter changes, there is something wrong, and further investigations (blood and LCS laboratory tests) are needed to determine the diagnosis. I would like to directly review your brain MRI report for a more professional opinion. What is your medical history?

I have not met with any kind of accident or lift any heavyweights.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, your SI (sacroiliac joint) joint would have got into a bit of dysfunction as it normally happens from faulty posture. In addition to the ice packs, I want you to do cobra raise exercise with left leg bent at the knee and foot kept under opposite thigh like a figure of four position at least 20 times once in two hours if possible. Do lots of stretching for your piriformis and gluteus muscles. Gently massage the butt muscles. It will give you relief.

I would like to know the stage, chances of survival and the life expectancy.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the images (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The imaging is clearly showing a gallbladder tumor. There are different types of gallbladder tumors and the prognosis, outcome, and survival is different from one person to other. Here we do not know yet which type of gallbladder tumor it is. That will be known only after surgical removal of the tumor or after a surgical biopsy from the tumor. The PET/CT (positron emission tomography/computed tomography) is showing tumor is free from distant metastasis (spread). It looks stage-3 radiologically. But actual staging will be known after surgery (pathological staging). The most common type of gallbladder tumor is adenocarcinoma and the prognosis for adenocarcinoma gallbladder is usually poor except in early stages. It is usually a chemoresistant tumor. The only curative treatment in these tumors is radical surgery (removal of the tumor along with gallbladder) if technically feasible. So, it is necessary to have a tissue confirmation of the diagnosis before commenting on survival and prognosis and actual staging.

So, you have to take medicine for a long term. The effect of rheumatoid arthritis varies from patient to patient. In some people, after taking proper medicine, further damage to joints can be prevented. However, in some, it persists even after taking medicine.

It was happening to me when I lay down and now it happens when I am standing too. I took medicine for acid reflux for two weeks. I have no heartburn. But still, have symptoms. Blood pressure is normal and heart rate changes frequently from 59 to 78. No stress and no anxiety. It happens when I am very relaxed. Mostly at night, but lately during the day too. I did ECG but they said my heart is good. But maybe I have something it does not detect. I had a reading of 152/99 two weeks ago, but after a diet, it went down to 120/81.","Doctor":"Hello. This can be cardiac arrhythmia like PSVT (paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia) or atrial fibrillation, in which heart rate suddenly goes up and also suddenly decreases. Blood pressure falls during these episodes and one has dizziness, fainting, chest pain or discomfort, blackouts, sometimes syncope. Usually, ECG is normal as it is usually done in between the episodes. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You will need 24-hour Holter monitoring. So, visit a nearby cardiologist for these investigations. Is there any stress or anxiety associated? Until your evaluation is complete, you can ask your local doctor for tablet Ciplar LA (Propranolol) 20 mg once a day.

MCV stands for mean corpuscular volume which is the mean volume of the red blood cells. MCH is mean corpuscular hemoglobin, which is the mean amount of hemoglobin in each red blood cell. From your test results (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it does not look like you have anemia since your hemoglobin, RBC count and MCHC are normal.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

The next day, I felt pressure in my head and as though I was about to die. I then could not recall getting home or the rest of the night. I was fine in the morning.

I agree with you on the fact that when dealing with hemiplegic migraine, it is necessary excluding a brain aneurysm or any arterio-venous malformation, which may mimic this clinical situation. That is why it is necessary performing a brain MRI, which would detect any possible brain aneurysm if present. Regarding the loss of conscience, I would also recommend performing an EEG (electroencephalogram) to investigate for seizures (although 40 minutes is a long period for a seizure, not typical).

He never penetrated me fully but his penis was around that area for a while and probably pushing around entry area. When we actually had sex, he used a condom and ejaculated into that.

Receptive oral sex carries a risk of transmission of herpes simplex virus if he has a history of cold sores. Otherwise, it can be assumed to be safe. HIV is not a risk because saliva is not infectious. As far as rubbing genitals is concerned, if there was no penetration or any fluids exchanged (precum), then it carries a negligible risk of HIV though there is a risk of genital herpes and HPV especially since it was a prolonged rubbing. However, penetrative sex is not safe, and there is a risk of HIV and other STDs like herpes simplex virus infection, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and HPV.

Moreover, it has formed a loop as now you are in the fear that every time it will not erect. So, I feel it is basically a psychological cause.

Is there anything to worry or is it just a dry skin?","Doctor":"Hi. Is it associated with itching or pain? Did you apply any cream or commercial hair dye? Is it present only on one side of the face?

The pain in the gut is persistant. She does crossfit twice weekly and wall climbs at the gym. But says the pain discourages her from having sex. Any ideas?","Doctor":"Hello. So we need to consider partial response for the treatment. We should also rule out other causes for the abdominal pain. What is the exact site of pain? Is it upper abdomen, lower abdomen or generalized? Is there any vaginal discharge, burning and frequent urination or diarrhea? I am keeping the possibility of simple gastritis, which is usually associated with upper abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, burping, increase in pain on food, sour water feeling in the throat or chest burning. If associated, she needs some antacids like Esomeprazole and Domperidone combination. Other possibility is of pelvic inflammatory infection of genital tract which may cause pain in the lower abdomen and pain during sex. If it is not fitting in either, then antibiotics course needs to be repeated with another antibiotic. Usually, Rifaximin is given but if inadequate relief is there, then she should be given a combination regimen of Metronidazole 500 mg three times per day along with Cephalexin 500 mg three or four times per day. She should also receive multivitamin supplements. For immediate pain relief, she can have antispasmodic like tablet Dicyclomine 20 or Hyoscine 10 mg whenever needed upto three times a day. This should give her symptomatic relief. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him/her and take the medicines with their consent.

Although it was not causing any pain, she is just curious to know if it can get treated by medication. She felt that its size increased slightly, but she does not prefer surgery. For your information, the present size is the size of a peanut.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your case. Most likely, the diagnosis is a sebaceous cyst. It is spontaneous, which means it has no obvious cause. And in most cases, it is painless. Sometimes, it increases in size. As you know, the best treatment for this is excision through surgery as it sometimes bothers a lot while combing or washing hair. But please counsel your mother that it will not go away with creams or oral medication. It is going to persist. My recommendation is reassurance and that means either do nothing or go for surgery which is only a minor procedure and takes only about five minutes. If you do not want it, then just apply Polyfax plus ointment (Polymyxin B Sulfate and Bacitracin Zinc) on a trial basis for two weeks. Otherwise, you can just forget about this as it is benign. Relax in short. Wish your mother a very good health. Mothers often need reassurance and some kind attitude. And just tell her this is not something to worry about.

I had gone through extreme stress early that year and after that, I had a flare-up. I lost 9 kg in a month. Then, the doctors detected ulcers in my ileum I was diagnosed with Crohn's. I was out of work for 14 months. Assuming that it is a genetic or immune system-related disease, I have a couple of questions.  Does it initiate due to stress? Does Crohn's get worse due to stress because now I need to take Humira every alternate week? Does the ulcers/flare-up happen due to stress?  I am currently on Humira (Adalimumab), Azathioprine, and Omeprazole.","Doctor":"Hi. You have a very good treatment response to Adalimumab. You are on top-down therapy. Usually, flares are due to non-compliance with medications, secondary infections or malignant transformation. Usually, stress does not cause flare-ups.  You may be switched back to Pentasa granules (Mesalazine) and Azoran (Azathioprine) as your terminal ileum has normalized endoscopically. You need to comply with medications.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

My dermatologist recommended me to use Restreta tablet for improving my complexion. I have to take it twice in a day before a meal. I want to know whether there will be any hormonal imbalance because of this tablet. Is it safe for me to eat? Will it affect my body internally? And I have been told to eat it for three months. So will the result be permanent or will they fade after I discontinue it?","Doctor":"Hello. Restreta (Glutathione, Collagen, and L-cysteine) contains Glutathione which is an antioxidant. It effectively prevents melanin synthesis in the skin which helps in skin lightening. It is available in oral and injection form. Oral capsules do not produce much of a change in complexion because of its poor absorption in the stomach. It does not have any side effects. The injection form produces good results but it is not FDA approved. The results with Restreta are not permanent. It will definitely decrease within few months of stopping the drug. So, it is better to go for natural forms of antioxidants present in fruits such as carotene and papaya. Have plenty of water. Avoid sun exposure and use sunscreen every day along with a good moisturizer for your skin. That will eventually help in the long term.

During which my condom broke and then immediately I withdrew my penis and went to the washroom and cleaned my penis with water. After this incident, I am having a little cough and small red spots on my hand. Can this be HIV symptom? Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. Unprotected sexual encounters are a risk factor for multiple STDs including HIV. Condom slippage is considered as condom failure, and it is regarded as unprotected act. However, the risk of acquiring HIV through the sexual route is as low as 0.02 to 0.5 %. HIV has a window period up to three months during which the test results can be a false negative. Hence, it is advisable to get a screening test done now and again at 12 weeks after the last exposure. Coming to your symptoms, they appear non-specific and unlikely to be due to HIV. The usual symptoms are fever, joint pains, and skin rashes which last hardly few days and usually start around two to three months after getting infected. The investigations to be done are ELISA, HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen), anti-HCV (hepatitis C virus) and VDRL (venereal disease research laboratory test).

Bleeding from rectum can be because of a number of conditions, but since it is bright red blood it suggests, Having said that, you do not have to worry by any means about the condition.

Even for anteroseptal infarction, it does not satisfy the criteria. But, considering your symptoms, the first possibility is of minor heart attack called as unstable angina. So, it raises the possibility of blockages in your arteries. Were Troponin or CK-MB (Creatine kinase) levels done? Have you been started on any medicines like Aspirin or Statin? I think, you should be started and should get an evaluation done. Have a healthy lifestyle, avoid smoking, and heavy activities till then.

For that, you can use interdental brushes (available in different sizes in a single pack - looks like miniature bottle brushes). You just have to give a push motion in the gap from the facial to the tongue/palate side of the gap.

Most of the time the noise is constant 3 or 4 on a scale of 1 to 10. Yesterday morning I experienced my best day as the noise seemed to reduce to a 2. However, it went back up to a 3 and 4 again yesterday afternoon and most of today. I did see an audiologist several days who examined and tested my hearing. No hearing loss was found, and he said my ears looked healthy. He was optimistic in saying I should improve in the coming weeks. Should I be concerned that the loudness returned?

Every normal person can hear that sound many times in their lives. It goes away as suddenly as it had started. There is no reason for worrying as you have no hearing loss.

I suppose she was in a rush? Not to mention she discovered four cavities under sealants I have had in the past. I have been here checking online about short roots and making myself paranoid. I wish I had a picture of my X-rays from today to make this more clear. But my main concerns are just does this have anything to do with root resorption and are my retainers making my short roots worse? I have not had braces since I was 14 and I have always worn my retainers since. I cannot sleep without them. But are my retainers causing my short roots more stress? And can this lead to root resorption?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand how you feel. But, root resorption occurs in deciduous teeth prior to shedding. In permanent teeth, root resorption occurs during pathology/disease. Regarding the cavities, if it is not near to pulp (blood vessel of the tooth), you can get it filled. There is nothing to worry about short roots. If the cavity is near the pulp, you will have to go for a root canal and again short roots will not create a problem with that but the crown placement might be affected. Yes, orthodontic treatment causes mild tooth resorption for tooth movement but is compensated and retainers will not cause much of root resorption. You may genetically or developmentally have short roots. Nothing to worry much, if there is no pathology, problem or mobility. I would suggest you remove the retainers at night as the tissues need some rest (eight hours). I hope I have answered your doubt.

I have looked up other options which suggest taking a birth control pill, but since it has other side effects too, I am not actually in favor of taking it. My period is in two weeks, and since the symptoms of pregnancy and PMS are almost the same, I am worried. Maybe it is just because it was the first time but still, should I take a pill? Or should I just leave the situation as it is?","Doctor":"Hi. Since there was no ejaculation, there is no chance of pregnancy. But, if you have a doubt then take an emergency contraceptive pill within 72 hours of intercourse. There is no chance of pregnancy. However, if you have a doubt then get back to me.

I was given Imiquimod cream to be applied for 10 to 15 minutes in the morning on alternate days and then wash off. The treatment went on for two months. Warts became lighter but did not go completely. It is definitely better than before. Do I need a biopsy or should I change to Glizigen cream which another doctor prescribed for two months twice daily?","Doctor":"Hi. Imiquimod is good medicine for genital wart. It has to be applied thrice a week for 16 weeks. If you see results with Imiquimod, I would suggest you stick to Imiquimod and complete the full course. Other options for genital wart are Podowart application (Podophyllotoxin), cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen, topical TCA (Trichloroacetic acid) application. You can discuss these options with your doctor. For more information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 33-year-old male. I would like to consult about my recurring mild cough during night time, and sneeze and runny nose in the morning that usually go away before lunchtime. I recently consulted a pulmonary doctor due to severe cough she gave me antibiotics, anti-histamine in the morning, Seretide oral spray, and medicine that uses a nebulizer. I have finished it, the cough as well as the sneezing, and runny nose went away for a couple of days. Suddenly the mild cough, sneezing, and runny nose came back. I also mentioned the recurring allergic attack to the pulmonary doctor that is why she gave me the anti-histamine because she told me that the cough might be an allergic reaction. I just take in vitamin C tablets and ginger daily. I do not use any medications right now. Last night I experienced mild cough again, I have resorted to use the Seretide oral spray because I experience slight discomfort in breathing. I have no idea what I could be allergic to? I have no food allergy. I usually have a jacket when I sleep because we sleep with air condition on. It is fine if it is just me but I sleep with my partner and a 2-year-old kid in a room. I do not have a fever or any symptoms of Coronavirus. I can no longer consult an allergologist near me due to the lockdown in our area. I hope you can put an end to this recurring problem. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi. Please continue the antihistaminic. Preferably pair it up with Montelukast. Take the medicine at 6 PM in the evening. You need a steroidal nasal spray like Mometasone as well. Take Albuterol inhaler SOS and a Budesonide inhaler twice daily for a week. Avoid exposure to cold air from the AC. Keep the blower of Aircon away from you. Keep an optimum temperature of 25 degrees. Do not lie down directly under the fan. Keep all surfaces extremely clean and tidy. Wipe all areas with a wet cloth every few days. Keep carpets, curtains, upholsteries, puffed toys, etc., very clean and dust free.

No fever or unusual swelling, etc. I have what I feel to be a normal pain. My only concern is that sometimes (not always and not with same movements) I hear what sounds like a gurgling sound (squishy) or a clicking sound (very light with no pain) almost like a little pop near my shoulder. I just want to make sure that this is normal. I called my surgeon and he said that it will go away.","Doctor":"Hello. What your surgeon has said is true. Few days postoperative may be until two weeks there will be slight crackling sound near and around the implant site. It is normal. The space created for the implant during surgery is what makes that sound. Nothing much to worry about as it will resolve on its own.

How many motions are you having in a day and since how many days? It is likely to be enteritis. Most importantly have ORS (oral rehydration solution) 100 to 200 ml with each stool and keep yourself rehydrated. Drink liquid as much as possible. You should also visit a hospital to assess hydration status and whether you need IV fluids. You should get prescribed capsule Vizylac or Sporulac sachet three times a day for five days, tablet Norflox TZ (Norfloxacin and Tinidazole) two times a day along with some antacid like tablet Pantoprazole before breakfast once a day for five days.

For the past seven days, she is not regular in pooping. She pooped four times throughout seven days that too like a paste. We consulted a doctor three days before and were told that this is normal and we have to wait for three more days. Today when we consulted the doctor, he told to admit her in the hospital because he will give rectal suppository which needs one-day observation in case if loose stool happens. Then, she will be under medical care. We said we will admit her tomorrow and they prescribed Bifilac sachet 1/2-0-1/2 for two days. Is it normal for babies to have irregular pooping? Baby is normal and she is not continuously crying and on Bevon multivitamin with D3 oral drops. Kindly suggest what has to be done. Should I consult a different doctor?","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, It is normal for the baby to have irregular pooping for at least three months. If you are saying that the baby was passing stool two to three times a day before, then, I will say increase breastfeeding frequency and duration. Baby passing paste like motion can be due to inadequate breastfeeding. If the baby is fed well, no irritability or abdominal fullness or distension, the baby is playful and passing adequate urine (five to six times a day), then I will suggest you to wait. I do not think there is a need for treatment at this stage. I do not recommend rectal suppository at this early age as the baby is playful, passing urine adequately and there is no abdominal distension. If feeding improves (breastfeeding every two hourly), pooping habits shall improve. You can stop multivitamin and D3 drop till pooping improves. I will encourage the focus on breastfeeding. The mother should take a lot of fruits, vegetables, and enough water.

I take fastidious care of my teeth and gums, including flossing, using a proxy brush and water pick at least two to three times a day, which helps to keep the periodontal inflammation under control. But, every few months, I have a flare-up of redness, swelling and sometimes bleeding with pus in this area in spite of diligent care. During times of flare-ups, I use hydrogen peroxide in water pick, good germs designed specifically for gums and Peridex following cleaning. Sometimes, this regimen works well and resolves the infection. Other times, it does not, and I have to resort to having the pocket cleaned out using Cavitron ultrasonic and treated with Arestin (Minocycline) 0.1 % antibiotic gel by my periodontist. I started having symptoms of pressure and mild pain in and around tooth #8 about two days ago. I guess these symptoms to be the beginning of infection. There is no redness, swelling or abscess of the gum at this point. I do not want to lose the tooth, so I am very concerned to treat this infection early but, I am concerned about using the antibiotic gel too much and creating a resistant superbug. The X-ray consistently shows a large pocket between #7 and #8 with some bone loss. I am unable to post the X-ray here. The tooth is intact. The pocket was treated using Arestin (Minocycline) 0.1 % antibiotic by placing it in the pocket on several occasions since five years with in-between gaps of one to two years. Otherwise, it is managed with my daily hygiene regimen, regular hygienist cleanings every two months, including using Cavitron ultrasonic to clean out the pocket, and, use of Hydrogen peroxide, good germs, and, Peridex during flares. My questions for you are:  I am concerned about developing a superbug in my mouth (i.e., antibiotic-resistance) from frequent use of the Arestin antibiotic gel in that pocket. How dangerous would that be? What is the likelihood such a resistant bacteria is created? Is there anything you can do about it? In the situation where the gum gets infected to the degree I need to get an antibiotic gel put on by the periodontist, would oral antibiotics be preferable or more effective? How effective would oral antibiotics be for this? Would a root canal help to reduce the problem of ongoing, repeated infections in regards to the gum disease? Or would that be irrelevant to the gum disease?","Doctor":"Hi. The antibiotic resistance is not a big issue as such, but I would suggest to not apply antibiotic gel more than two weeks with one or two months gap in between. Using warm salt water gargle twice a day is more than enough for good hygiene of gums. Root canal treatment will not help much in resolving gum infection as such but will stop any toothache or sensitivity you might be having in the concerned tooth. The X-ray which you have attached suggests a ceramic bridge which is placed to replace a missing tooth (attachment removed to protect patient identity), but root canal treatment has not been done for the supporting two teeth. It is better to get them root canal treated to prevent any mobility of those teeth and to get added strength by ankylosis of the roots to the bone. And if the gum infection is around that bridge then it is highly recommended to get them root canal treated for more strength. Chlorhexidine antibiotic gel or even Metrogyl (Metronidazole), if available there, is good enough for a local application. Continue with mild Hydrogen peroxide gargle or salt water (I recommend) and scaling of your teeth and gums once in six months.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Accutane also known as Isotretinoin prescribed for the treatment of acne used as a last resort if no other treatments are showing a promising response. Gastric sleeve surgery is not a contraindication to take this medication and it will not cause any weight gain. Although in some studies it has been noticed that Accutane is better avoided when a cosmetic procedure such as rhinoplasty is undertaken for up to a period of six months. However, the drug has other side effects which are rare but you should have been informed by your physician before they prescribed it to you such as sensitivity to sunlight, headache, and many others. Remember that your doctor has prescribed this medication because he or she has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects.

I was the head of my country and made the rules. I added the experiences of real life in that game. When I was alone, I played the role of different people like sometimes I assumed myself as a teacher of some school of my country and played as if I am teaching the students. Whenever I got time, I played the game. One of my real friends was also a member of my imaginary world. Sometimes I played with him and sometimes alone. I have also created some festival of my world and celebrate it. I had created many institutions in my world. My universe was not fully detailed or written, but it just exists in my mind. But, I left this game three years ago, and now I am 18 years. But I do not find myself comfortable in the real world. My two personality is now creating conflict in the real world.

So my question is when I know very well that my world was my imagination and nothing else, then why am I still suffering? Will the problem be solved without treatment when I grow up?","Doctor":"Hi. Most probably you are suffering because in your imaginary world, you enjoy the things and in the real world you have to adjust yourself according to the situation. This is causing anxiety symptoms and headache leading to poor academic performance. Secondly, the situation may resolve spontaneously but chances are less that it will remit without proper counseling or psychotherapy.

Does this sound at all like the syndrome? I have not received a Meniere's diagnosis, but I am scared I might be in the early stages of it because only one ear is involved. About 14 months ago, I had recovered from a long period of an upper respiratory cold. When I started to feel better, I started getting a headache in my left ear. Some people have never heard of a headache in the ear, but if you can imagine what a migraine feels like (throbbing, pounding, etc.) that is exactly what it felt like but directly in my ear. It was happening every two to three days. It would subside with Advil. Usually, when I get a headache or a migraine, I do not think too much of it, but these headaches started to get my attention. Why were they always in the same spot? Was I doing something wrong? I changed my diet, thinking it was the food. I tried to get more sleep as I was also postpartum, and nothing budged. I got massages, etc. Then, around the same time, I got BPPV in my right ear. At this time, I did not have any tinnitus. I was treated with the Epley maneuver for the BPPV which was a terrifying experience. For example, I would be holding my cell phone in between my neck and shoulder and have violent, brief, vertigo episodes, sometimes in public too. Anyways, that was treated. After the actual spinning sensation was gone, I noticed I was still dizzy. It was not as violent as before, but it was still there. If I moved my head suddenly, I would feel a minor sense of disorientation for one to five second. Almost like the feeling you get when you shake your head and then stop. I still have that feeling today. And, at the same time, with more and more ear headaches, my left ear started developing more pronounced hyperacusis and tinnitus. I have had it in both ears, but it is more pronounced in the left. In the left ear, I also have a morris-code type of tinnitus on top of the constant one. I cannot say I get episodes of extreme vertigo. I just get dizzy moving my head from say, looking down at my cell phone, to looking straight or looking down to the left to looking straight. Sometimes, I will just be staring at something and get visual vertigo. It has just been awful. I do not feel like I am living in the same body anymore. And it concerns as to why all of the other symptoms are only in the left ear. I have had a full workup of vestibular testing, and they have been normal. I do not have any hearing loss either. There is nothing I know that causes headaches in the left ear, and I know that the hyperacusis and tinnitus are a result of the headaches I get. Also, the left ear clicks and flutters at times as well. Sometimes, it pops on its own. I know something is going on in there and it is scary that I do not have any answers. VENG, ECOG, MRI head, CT scan head and hearing test, all are normal. Does this sound like Meniere's?","Doctor":"Hi. If Epley maneuver has improved your dizziness, then it does not seem to be Meniere's disease, and also you used to get vertigo only when you shake your head which is not so in Menier's. Also, you will have hearing loss as well in Meniere's. Ringing in your left ear, is it the only complaint right now? Are you on any regular medications right now or did you take any medicines for a long duration before? Did you have any viral infection recently? Do you have photophobia?

First, only based on these symptoms, it is difficult to say with certainty. I would like to ask if you have any medical problem as of now, and taking any medicine, or using any substance of abuse. These symptoms could be due to: So, to reach a diagnosis, you need to undergo few investigations including full blood count, blood sugar, thyroid function test, B12 and folate level, CT or MRI brain, liver and renal function test. There are psychological tests such as MMSE (mini-mental state examination), or Hamilton depression rating scale (to find the level of depression), ADAS - Cog to find the level of cognition. I recommend that you consult a psychiatrist in person for a detailed evaluation. The timeline for neurodegenerative diseases is different for each disease and also vary considerably in different people, like Alzheimer disease progresses in 5 years to a decade while prion disease progression is very rapid.

See, solitary pulmonary nodule which is asymptomatic does not require any further investigations. However, any persisting fever, cough and cold warrants bronchoscopy and biopsy of the lesion to rule out any possible causes. Atelectasis is the collapse of alveoli of the lung. So, that needs an evaluation from my side. I would suggest bronchoscopy for you based on your current scenario.

Now I have a problem of headache, fast heartbeat only when trying to sleep, also feel like my left chest has a lot of gas. Why I am especially worried is I vomited and I highly suspect blood in it and also feels shortness of breath. I am taking 2.5 mg Cilazapril.","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  As per the liver function test (LFT) of your blood, you have a mild increase in GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase). GGT suggests there is a possibility of mild damage to the liver and biliary system especially due to alcohol. We need to have full liver function reports so we can compare your AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT ratio.  Blood or dark brown colored vomitus is always abnormal you need to find the cause. If you are taking alcohol drinks please try to minimize. Pain in the chest with blood in the vomitus can be of a reason for stomach or esophageal pathology also. So please get checked and followup with reports. Please do CBC (complete blood count), LFT, coagulation profile and bleeding time."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

I was on crutches for six weeks and am now walking the past few weeks without. The fracture was a tiny hairline fracture of the sacrum and another two hairline fractures on the side towards the hip. No fractures were in the joints and I was able to heal with no surgery. The problem is that I am still getting a lot of pain which alternates from the front round to the lower back, with the back pain being the worst as it is so stiff I am finding it very hard to walk. I also get numbness and tingling in my right lower leg and foot specifically at night which sometimes stops me sleeping. I am very worried this pain and stiffness are going to stay with me now specifically the back pain and stiffness. I was told I would make a full recovery although I do remember one of the many doctors briefly saying I could get lasting back pain in the sacrum even though it was so fine it could not be seen on the X-ray. I have been taking up swimming twice a week. I am not back at work yet.","Doctor":"Hello. The pain what you have could be due to SI (sacroiliac) joint which in turn may inhibit butt muscles and develop spasm. I suggest you do a lot of icing on the sacrum and on the butt muscles frequently, for 15 minutes every two hours once possibly. Since there is a fracture, I am not recommending any massage or stretches for now. Do not worry. Everything will be alright as the tingling sensation and pain is due to spasm compressing the neural structures running below the muscle and will get settled down. Hope this is helpful for you.

People having type 4 skin produce more melanin on exposure to sunlight. Tanning is a kind of protection from sun so that we do not burn. To remove this sun tan, avoid further exposure to sunlight, use sunscreen with SPF 50 and Suncros tint sunscreen. Apply sunscreen 30 minutes before stepping out and repeat applying every 4 hours. Sunscreen provide protection for 3 to 4 hours. Hence, need to apply repeatedly. Use Kojic acid, Glycolic acid and Arbutin combination cream (it comes by name Demelan cream) for dark areas at night.

You did not mention here whether your partner uses condoms or not. You may be allergic to the condoms or any added ingredient like spermicide that you or your partner used. Although it is possible to be allergic to any type of condoms. Latex is the main common culprit. Between 1-6% people of your race are allergic or sensitive to latex like you. Again, spermicide are commonly used in gels, suppositories, and lubricants. Nonoxynol-9 is the most common active ingredient in spermicide is known to cause irritation or allergy to some people especially when used frequently.

The very fact that the child is able to crawl shows that leg muscles are working fine and have enough strength to lift the weight of the body.

He is myopic with the approximate power in left eye being -5.5 spherical and cylindrical - 0.5, right eye being -6 spherical and cylindrical - 0.75. Since the last few days (4 to 5 days) he is facing a problem in his eyes. He feels his automatic blinking has stopped and has to blink consciously. He has also been complaining of eye irritation, itching and watering in the eye which happens as he is not blinking. He is reminded of blinking when the itching or watering starts. He is disturbed because of this and not able to concentrate on his studies. What has caused this reduced or no blinking? It is really worrying.","Doctor":"Hi. First of all, we have to take care of itching and watering, and for that, you have to start Moxifloxacin eye drop four times a day for five days and Refresh Liquigel eye drop (Carboxymethylcellulose sodium) six to eight times a day. It can be continued for a long time as it has no side effects. Now coming to the blinking part, blinking is a response that is to be carried out by both conscious and unconscious mind. You are saying that unconscious blinking has reduced. For diagnosing the problem, we have to conduct a cotton wisp test by an ophthalmologist by which we can check the child's corneal sensation because if the corneal sensation is reduced, it can lead to reduced blinking. Also, while you are at the doctor's, you can have him rechecked for glasses to see whether the prescription for glasses has changed or not because that can lead to watering. Spending more time on mobiles and laptop can cause reduced blinking. So, please look into it.

Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take medications with their consent. If you are suffering from weight loss or evening rise of temperature or night sweats, then there is a possibility of pulmonary tuberculosis.

We were close but I do not think that anything should happen because we both were wearing clothes (undergarments). Because of this hunch, she took Unwanted 72 under 12 hours. She had her last period from 31st to 4th last month. She took the pill on 6th. Now, its been more than a week and she did not have her periods. Also, she is a virgin. Are there chances of pregnancy? For how much longer will the periods be delayed?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your history and understand your concerns. As she had Unwanted 72, the chances of pregnancy are not there in your case. Delayed menses could be due to hormonal imbalance caused by the pill. Just wait and watch for your menses. If missed by seven days get your home urine pregnancy test done. For further queries consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I want an opinion for my mother. My mother has been feeling arthritis pain since last few years. Recently, I have read somewhere about a medicine name Prednicort (5 mg) which is specially used for asthma disease. But, I have read that this medicine is also helpful for arthritis pain. Is Prednicort (5 mg) helpful for arthritis pain? Please also prescribe a medicine that is really good for arthritis pain.","Doctor":"Hello. Prednicort (Prednisolone) is a steroid which is good as an anti-inflammatory and painkiller in arthritis but has very serious adverse effects in the long term such as osteoporosis, gastritis, hypertension, and elevated blood sugar levels. Is she diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis? If she is, Mexotrexate injection weekly will be helpful. The most important issue is to identify the cause of arthritis then management will be accordingly. Please provide me with more details about her condition.

From the last eight months, I am not feeling well mentally and having chest tightness and pain. After echo, I was diagnosed with trivial mitral valve prolapse and redundant chordae tendineae. Please help me, doctor.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your echo and ECG are fine. The echo just shows a redundant chordae which means the chordae is longer. Trivial MR is normally seen in many persons. So, nothing majorly abnormal in your reports. This certainly will not cause you a chest pain or any problems. Neither you need medicine nor any surgery. So, whatever is there, it is in your mind, not heart. You are having a lot of stress which is probably causing gastritis and reflux which is the cause of chest pain. Do you also have upper abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, burping, increase in pain on food, sour water feeling in throat or chest burning. These are the other symptoms and may be associated. I suggest you get prescribed tablet Pan DSR 40 mg (Pantoprazole and Domperidone) before breakfast once a day for two weeks. Also, for headache and stress, to calm your mind, you should have some medicine like tablet Tryptomer 10 mg (Amitriptyline) bedtime for two weeks.

Three days after having sex, I got a sore on my lips. I am confused that it happened because of cold or is it something else and from that time continuously, I have a sludge kind of cold. Please find the attached sore image and suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the image (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The lip outer layer is slightly red. It does not seem to be due to cold. It may be due to allergy. For the allergy, you can apply lip balm. I suggest taking tablet Recofast plus (Paracetamol, Pseudoephedrine, and Triprolidine) two times a day after food for three to five days and tablet Montek 10 (Montelukast) one at night for five to seven days.

Do CA 125 level, CT scan abdomen and pelvis, X-ray, sonography, PET scan and consult a gynecologist near you and also take an opinion from an oncosurgeon. Doctors will do other routine investigations also like LFT, RFT, hemogram, HIV, Au-Ag, blood group, 2D echo, ECG. All this is to be done and consultation along with clinical examination required for deciding further management of this if to directly go for surgery or not. In that case, the best option is chemotherapy or radiotherapy. But yes, you need to take steps on an urgent basis if the MRI report is like this and you suspect malignancy with some changes. I do not want to over exaggerate this but malignancy can grow way faster than you imagine. The final diagnosis will be after sending for biopsy or HPE (histopathological examination). I do not know why you have done the MRI and what complaints she has, but whatever it is, if this is what the report says, then the above things should be done as soon as possible.

At first, the discomfort was in the flank portion. I went to a urologist he gave me muscle relaxers and a few tablets for clearing any small stones. The discomfort went away after taking the medication. But after some days may be due to sex or workout am not sure, the discomfort returned back. I went to the doctor again he suggested a CT scan. CT scan results showed a lot of stools in the bowel. He said to maintain a healthy diet and add more water and fiber and do some exercises if the problem persists he asked to check with the general practitioner. I had an appointment with my family physician who said the discomfort can be due to lack of bowel movements in the colon. He asked me to take a fiber supplement (Metamucil) after taking it I had clean bowel movements and I felt I was relieved. Of late, I stopped taking the fiber supplement for a couple of days I started having hard stools. Again I called up the doctor, he said no harm in taking Metamucil. So I started it again and drinking at least three liters of water. I am doing like he said to have clean bowel movements. Sometimes the discomfort switches sides left or right. At times my backache as well. I told the doctor and he said it can be chronic constipation can go for many days. I sense my stomach or colon may getting inflamed as the day goes by. After bath everything looks normal. But as day goes by I feel like stiffness or inflammation in the stomach. I am worried because this is been there for like starting January and not going away. There is no real pain but it is the discomfort and inflammation that disrupts my day to day activities. Please advise. Should I book an appointment with gastroenterologist may be to dig further? I read about ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, but I could not conclude anything based on symptoms. I do have an observation that if I masturbate or have sex, after having ejaculation discomfort increases the following day.","Doctor":"Hello. I can imagine your reason of concern for such ongoing on and off symptoms. Well first of all, if it were ulcerative or Crohn's disease it should have shown something abnormal on CT scan which I presume it did not. However, remember the CT scan reporting is completely a subjective thing. It depends highly on the expertise of radiologists who has reported that. I would urge if you upload the report in reply to this response, I would be glad to see that. There will be no charges for that I will allow you one free follow up. Now the presence of too many stools is not an uncommon finding on CT Scan. Since it is basically the function of the colon to reserve stools transit them timely in anterograde direction and finally to be evacuated through the rectum and anal canal. If the presence of stool with dilation of the lumen of colon or presence of stools within small bowel (fecalization of small bowel) and/or dilation of the lumen of small bowel suggest an alarming finding. Normally our small bowel does not usually contain stools, it rapidly empties matter to in to large bowel, hence the presence of stool in small bowel suggests an abnormal finding. I will tell you why this information on CT scan is important. For example, you have a normal size of the lumen of bowel (ideally less than 3 cm of small bowel and less than 5 cm of large bowel) with the symptoms you mention, it can be irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. If the diameter of the lumen is above the normal it can be functional constipation of which two further types. The one is chronic colonic constipation or colonic pseudo-obstruction called as Ogilvie's syndrome. The other where the small bowel is dilated called chronic small bowel pseudo obstruction. I hope you now have an idea why it is important to correlate symptoms with the CT scan findings. Now coming to your symptoms, the pain or discomfort is often common when bowel loops are distended with gas or stools and your discomfort which readily resolves after you have good bowel movements suggest the possibility of the same and not otherwise due to a serious underlying cause. The intensity of discomfort that changes with the bowel movement again suggests it might secondary to irritable bowel syndrome IBS. Metamucil is fiber laxative and really it does not have any harm if taken for years and years. The fiber is nonabsorbale molecule it does not go into blood circulation so have no side effects. However, in some it can cause bloating or belching. You can switch to other fibers such as Fibrocol if Metamucil does not suit you. Otherwise, it is completely normal if you want to resume the same. Take plenty of water it makes stool bulk large and soft and easy to pass. I myself have a habit of taking 3 liters of water in a day and this really makes wonder. You should continue that. I would wait for your CT scan report to see the findings then I will right you some investigations to rule out other possibilities. I believe you would not have anyone but just to be on the safe side."},{"Patient":"I have burning sensation in my throat for last 7 days still no other symptoms..may i effected from covid 19","Doctor":"Hello, I can understand your concern. As your area is facing more cases of covid19, it is good that you are seeking medical advice for your symptoms. First of all, I would like to say do not panic. The burning sensation in the throat can be due to some irritation that has caused due to especially cold things that you might have consumed as its summer and drinking cold drinks, cold water or ice-cream can cause it. Another reason for this can be nutritional deficiencies of some vitamins like vitamin C, vitamin B. So balance your diet with appropriate foods that are rich in vitamins and minerals. Keep yourself well hydrated throughout the day. Make sure that you don't drink anything that is extremely cold. It should get better in a few days. Now, as you are worried if this is due to covid 19. I would know if you have a recent travel history anywhere in or out of your country? Also, have you come across any covid19 patient recently? I also want to tell you that symptoms of Covid19 are cough, fever, occasional sneezing. In your case, there is just a burning sensation in the throat, so do not panic and keep yourself healthy with proper food. Also, maintain social distancing as well as continue hand-washing before touching your face, eyes, nose when you come in contact with anything outside. If you get the above-mentioned symptoms in the future then do visit your nearest covid19 test center. Hope this helps. Feel free to contact for any further queries in the future."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Regarding your concern, I would explain that your symptoms could be related to Metronidazole adverse effect. You should know that this drug can cause neuropathy as a possible adverse effect. For this reason, I recommend consulting with your attending doctor and performing a nerve conduction study (electroneurography) to investigate for this possible disorder.

Before proceeding to advanced staging you have to confirm to me that your wife has regular periods and you have a normal erection and semen analysis (you can send me the report). The next stage after excluding the male factor, we have to confirm that your wife is ovulating normally every month by a blood test.

Chest X-ray is normal along with ECG. I am suffering from chronic idiopathic constipation from the past 12 years. I have managed my constipation with fiber supplements, ayurvedic medicines, regular walk (8 km every day), good diet with fruits, etc., in the past.

So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

He was born with ankle clonus, but it was completely gone after a while. So, he no longer has clonus. He also has possible tongue fasciculations. I say possibly because the pediatrician said that it was difficult to tell if they were or not. He is always sticking his tongue out and has an active tongue. My question is, is tongue fasciculations in a baby/toddler always a sign of SMA? I am horrified by what I have read online. Is it possible that he is fine? I am desperate to know if tongue fasciculations always mean something bad. He is healthy and thriving in all ways.","Doctor":"Hello. You should know that tongue fasciculation do not have the same clinical significance in children as in adults. There are many abnormal neurological signs in adults which are usually present in normal children and disappear while growing up. This is because of an immature nervous system in children and incomplete myelinization of the nerves and central nervous system because of immaturity. As your child has a normal physical and psychological development, there is nothing to worry about ALS  (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). It is an exceptional diagnosis. So, just try not to think about it anymore.

I am currently outside the city and have not seen the reports. But, she told me that it is malignant and has spread to two lymph nodes. There is no metastasis. Doctors have told to start chemotherapy for four months followed by surgery. I need to know how bad the condition is and is it curable?","Doctor":"Hello. I would definitely like to see the reports. But, as per your history if it has already spread to lymph nodes then it has locally advanced. What is usually done in such cases is to give new adjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery and radiotherapy. Though I have limited information, the stage would be at least II, might be III also. Breast cancer has different subtypes based on its molecular profile and treatment might also differ according to that. What I told you is a general outline. Yes, it can be cured in around 70 to 80 percent in this stage. But, depending on other adverse factors, the figure may come down to 50.

I have noted your concern and I have viewed the images (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You have sebaceous cysts of scrotal skin. They are not warts. Sebaceous cysts need to be removed surgically. The raised lesions on the corona of glans are penile papules. They are quite normal. There is no need for treatment.

I have been diagnosed so far with nasal septum deviation and tonsils to be removed. The CT scan shows my head before surgery. After the surgery, all symptoms still occur.  Do I have Eagle's syndrome? If so, is it just calcified or is it elongated? Do I have incisive canal cyst/fistula? Is there any sign of possible CSF leakage? Any other findings (except for the obvious deviated nasal septum)?","Doctor":"Hello. You might be aware that Eagle syndrome is a condition where there is an elongation of the styloid process or calcification of the stylohyoid ligament. This causes pressure on the cranial nerves and results in pain related to the nerve compression. We usually measure a styloid process and if it is longer than 3 cm in length then there is a possibility of Eagle syndrome. Your images (attachment removed to protect patient identity) show the possibility of Eagle syndrome in the axial images and your symptoms can be from nerve compression. It is difficult to accurately measure the length of the styloid process and to see the calcified stylohyoid ligament since the coronal plane images are not available. There is a cystic lesion in the hard palate and this can suggest a nasopalatine and incisive canal cyst. CSF leakage cannot be told on plane CT images. If needed then contrast study is done and looked for leakage. There is deviation of the nasal septum.

So, he is not able to ejaculate during intercourse. While doing masturbation, he is able to ejaculate within seconds. Now, he is taking medicines for reducing anxiety. I have undergone five cycles of IUI. Today, I did AMH and prolactin test. Now the doctors advised us to undergo ICSI as the AMH level is low and prolactin is very high. Kindly advise me whether I can get pregnant naturally or should I go with ICSI?","Doctor":"Hello. How are you doing? After going through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity), only AMH (anti-Mullerian hormone) seems to be the problem. Let me put forth a few facts. Your age is within the normal range for pregnancy and you should be having good egg count (this is what is assessed by AMH). Basic question is, is your period regular? If egg count is normal, you will ovulate every month on 28 +/- 7 days frequency. If ovulation is regular, forget prolactin. If you are tensed, around period date, had a sleepless night, been worried about something or been seeing that lab and needle for some time, all these and more can alter prolactin levels. Your scan shows lots of eggs in both ovaries, so I really doubt the credibility of the AMH. About your husband's problem, IUI (intrauterine insemination) is a very good option. Do not get disheartened by a failed IUI. Better ovulation protocol and methods can get you better results. Hope his semen has good motility and morphology. Hope your fallopian tubes have also been evaluated. Only then, IUI can help. ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) is always an option, but better keep it to the last. A young lady like you with seemingly no big problem should try all the smaller routes. ICSI is 45 % success. If that fails what next? So, always keep the big steps to the last. Try everything else before that. In short, I feel you should try other options or natural methods for some more time. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more queries.

Also, is the cough productive? If there is no productive cough and no fever, then you probably have a post nasal drip associated with the rhinitis, hence a chronic dry cough. It could also be tracheitis, in which case you may need prescription antibiotics if it does not go away or gets worse in a couple of days.

I have opted for light glycolic acid peels but did not make any difference and had few sittings of Nd: YAG laser hair removal. I have been through several treatments which made only things worse. I keep my face and hair very clean. I shampoo hair on alternate days, change pillow covers, wash face twice a day, and apply sunscreen while going out.

Take care of my super oily hair. Please help me. This is taking a toll on my confidence.","Doctor":"Hello. You have been following all the right advice. Continue the same for the face. As for the scalp, I think since it does not get resolved with antidandruff medication and there is crusting involved, my diagnosis would go in favor of scalp psoriasis.

On the next day shampoo with Keraglo-AD shampoo (Ketoconazole, Ichthyol Pale, and D-Panthenol). Repeat this process for 10 days. You will see a difference.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm?

Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it?

The symptoms are sneezing, headache. She is 3 months pregnant. What medicines can she take?","Doctor":"Hello. Since how many days is she having this attack? If it is for just one to two days, then we would better wait and will not start any antibiotics. She should have tablet Levocetirizine 5 mg twice a day for two days and tablet Paracetamol 500 mg if she is febrile and fever is more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit or for headache. This can be taken up to three times a day. If three or more days have passed, then she should get prescribed antibiotics like tablet Amoxicillin 500 mg three times a day along with tablet Rantac 150 mg twice a day for four to five days.

Sometimes there are few problems when medicines are started but they usually go spontaneously within 2 to 3 days. Medicine dosage can also be adjusted accordingly. So, stopping the treatment is not a good option. In my opinion, you shall consult the treating psychiatrist and start treatment with dosage change as per the current situation.

I am hypertensive but my BP is under control with medication.My question is could this be related to my BP and what degree of urgency would this be? I have been referred to an eye hospital.","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, this probably is related to hypertension. You are currently suffering from hypertensive retinopathy. Now your BP is under control but previous longterm episodes of uncontrolled BP has led to the narrowing of blood vessels in your retina and this has led to a response from your retina which led to the formation of new and leaky blood vessels. These vessels leak blood. Also, cotton wool spots indicate that it is hypertensive retinopathy. Now, coming to the treatment part: Both these tests will confirm if there is fluid accumulation inside the retina and also areas with these new vessels. In this treatment, you have to get pan-retinal photocoagulation plus I suggest you get injection antiVEGF substance. Along with that kindly see your specialist doctor to revise your antihypertensive treatment.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

She said she knew I would stare at it constantly and worry and that taking an atypical mole off here and there was alright and saved a lot of anxiety. She knows I have severe health anxiety. This mole was 3.5 mm and the worrisome thing was that it had a darker dot. I was hoping you would take a look. Before I left, I said, “If it is melanoma -“ but she interrupted and said she did not think it was. What I was going to ask though, was if it was, then hopefully it would be early since it is small.","Doctor":"Hello. I saw the picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Clinically, it does not look like melanoma, but it is good that your dermatologist did a biopsy. So, the result will show us if it is a melanoma or not. It may most likely be a dysplastic nevus. I am sure your dermatologist would have looked at the lesion through a dermoscope, which enhances the features, and pattern of pigmentation. I feel it is good to get it biopsied rather than keep worrying about it.

It feels like heaviness or uneasiness. This problem is now from two years. There is no pain but there is a discomfort. It goes sometimes completely when I am at home but arises more when I come to my college hostel which is 600 km from home. I had four ultrasounds in between but nothing came on it. I also have dry piles (blood comes while stool) for sometimes. After that too, in the ultrasound there is nothing. Also, there is a blood test in which SGPT is 44. The doctor says it is because of very spicy foods which I take. So, I stopped from one month and my stool is fine. What is this basically? I do not have any physical problem but always thinking about this issue. The doctor says it is only gas. My gas release is not good. Also, I keep awake till 5 AM sometimes. When I think about it, it feels worse. So is it because of diet and my schedule or what? What are the suggestions?","Doctor":"Hello. It could be gastric irritation as you say it feels worse after eating. Since your ultrasonography is normal, and you do not have any other symptoms, it could be gastric discomfort. You could get an upper GI endoscopy done to see if all is normal. Also get Barium enema X-ray of the abdomen. However, if the heaviness is on the lower left abdomen, it could be diverticulosis as it is relieved after defecation. Please get the tests done and let me know the results. For now, no treatment as such is needed. We need to identify what is causing this.

Whenever I am not drinking enough water my urine is turning white in color. There is no associated abdominal pain. Is there any problem with this condition?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your query. I would like to know a few more details too. Passing cloudy/milky urine can be due to several conditions. Most commonly it is either due to some infection or due to excessive phosphate salts in urine. But can also be due to lymph in urine which needs to be evaluated. I would suggest a detailed clinical examination by a urologist with some basic urine analysis and ultrasound evaluation of the kidneys and bladder to identify the cause of the cloudy urine which then be treated appropriately.

I want to ask about having sex after periods because I am so worried my mom and dad will find out I am pregnant. I had sex today after my period and it was from the past two days.","Doctor":"Hello. Pregnancy usually occurs when sexual activity is practiced without protection, during the fertile period. You can estimate your fertile period using the calendar method. If your menstrual cycle is regular, then ovulation occurs 14 days before the next anticipated period. So, around that ovulation period, one week on either side is fertile period. As you had sex just after your period, it is unlikely to cause pregnancy.

Can it not be a simple infection? Glandular fever for instance?","Doctor":"Hello. His total leukocyte count is increased but the main reason for your doctor's suspicion for a hematolymphoid malignancy is the high basophil percentage. Leukemia is diagnosed by the presence of blasts more than 20 % in the blood and/or bone marrow and more than 25 % in case of lymphoblastic leukemia. It can only be confirmed by the examination of the blood and bone marrow. If the percentage of blasts is consistent with leukemia further tests like flow cytometry and genetic testing will be required for treatment. It is better to get a hematolymphoid malignancy ruled out. For more information consult a hematologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have a history of melanoma.

It is a very small papular lesion at present. It does not need biopsy at present. But, if there is: then consider a skin biopsy.

I have mild pain in my abdomen and there is brownish vaginal discharge. I took urine test and a faint pink line along with a strong pink line appeared. Am I pregnant? If so what medication should I take to avoid pregnancy? Also, if I take a blood test now, will it be more accurate?","Doctor":"Hello. A faint pink line does not confirm pregnancy. The dark line is for control. As your period is late by 20 days both lines should be dark, you can repeat the test after five days but if you have too much pain then you will need to do ultrasound test of the pelvis or transvaginal ultrasound. Without confirming or excluding pregnancy no medicine should be taken, it may harm you. Also, if the beta hCG level is in the pregnancy range then it will confirm. Otherwise, you will need to repeat the test after two days to see if the level is rising or not. That will be more accurate.

Kindly guide me whether my second baby is at risk.","Doctor":"Hi. Actually, your report is near normal or in the actual term that there is very low risk according to your age, blood parameters and sonography. There is low risk of having this baby positive for Down's. But, if you have the first baby with positive and want to confirm that whether this baby is definitely positive or negative, then there is only one way to confirm it. It is by sending liquid around baby for testing (amniocentesis). They remove baby cells from liquid and check its DNA to confirm that whether the baby is down's positive or not. As it is a genetic disease, it is possible to diagnose with DNA. But the procedure of amniocentesis in itself is high risk and there is always a minimum chance of abortion after the procedure. So, consult with your gynecologist and decide accordingly. These reports are of double marker test and it is a screening test and not a confirmatory test. It gives us high risk or low risk of pregnancy to have these congenital conditions. Do drink more water and take more rest. Consult with your gynecologist and discuss with family and take a decision what to do. If you continue your pregnancy without testing liquid around the baby then there is only minimal chances of a positive report and almost more than 99% chance of getting a normal baby is there.

This occurs suddenly without warning, and the exact cause is not known. We have various treatments, but none of it is full proof and 100 % effective. The first and foremost step in management is to find out the cause. Some investigations have to be done for that. If a cause cannot be found, then we empirically treat this condition. To find the cause, please do these tests: Complete blood count, Paul Bunnell test, syphilis serology, serum lipids, sugar and MRI brain with the auditory complex. If the cause is not discernable, we give the following treatment: Intratympanic steroid injection. We inject steroids into the middle ear which surpass into the inner ear and help relieve congestion edema and inflammation. You would need two injections in a week for six weeks. Recovery is seen usually but no guarantee. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy helps improve oxygen concentration in the inner ear and improves healing. Helps the damaged area obtain good nutrients and oxygenation. Complamina Retard (Xanthinol Nicotinate) taken twice daily helps increase blood supply to the inner ear. Additionally, you can take Gingko biloba supplement and multivitamin supplements with trace elements. If you are averse to intratympanic injections, you can take a course of oral steroids. But, intratympanic injections of steroids are better. I would like to tell you that you must start the treatment very soon. Nevertheless, recovery is not assured. If it does not recover, then the loss is bound to be lasting.

Coming to this point, I would recommend consulting with a neurologist and performing some cognitive tests and a brain MRI, just to be sure that everything is okay.

A balanced diet is necessary too, rich in omega 3 fatty acids (walnuts, fish, fish oil, olive oil, etc.) and avoid smoking or caffeine drinks.

I suggest you reduce the dose of Thyronorm. You can reduce by 25 micrograms. Generally, our target is within the lower half of the reference range for TSH which is approximately within 2 to 2.5. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and reduce the dosage with their consent. I suggest you do an FT4, and TSH repeat test after four weeks. And about the herbal supplement, as far as it does not interact with thyroid formulation, it is safe to take. But, you have to keep in mind that herbal formulations can contain drugs that did not undergo randomized controlled studies. So, it is better to avoid them.

But, I want to rely completely on Ayurveda for him to recover from this heart disease. After the stent, what medicine should he take, and how to overcome heart attack?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See as he has a stent implanted, he has to take all his heart medications. Along with that, he can start capsule Arjun two capsules two times a day with water after food for one month. In case you face any problem after taking this medicine stop taking it immediately. You can start these capsules if three months have passed since stent implantation and his condition is stable. I suggest you consult a nearby reputed ayurveda physician for his complete clinical examination and take medicine accordingly. I hope you understand my point.

Then one day after, the sensation was positioned in my right foot. It lasted for about two days, and then I had no symptoms. Now after a week, suddenly while reading, I notice the (vague) tingling sensation under my left knee. Does this sound like MS? I am really anxious. (I have health anxiety as well). I do not take any meds.","Doctor":"Hello. Your symptoms are not suggestive of MS (multiple sclerosis). So, you should not worry about this disorder. An electrolyte imbalance or a pinched nerve could lead to such complaints. For this reason, I would recommend performing some tests if the problem persists: Hope to have been helpful to you.

Can you please advice on the reasons and corrective measures to get the exceeded test values in control? Do I need to perform any follow-up tests? I have got the blood test profile checked just as a general checkup and not specific to any illness (I get it checked once every two years).","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through all your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and I am impressed with your overall health. However, there are a few things that need to be sorted out. Your total red blood cells and hemoglobin levels are slightly increased than normal but not significant in the absence of symptoms like headache, hypertension, itching in the body after a warm bath, etc. If you are a long-term smoker, this could be a cause of the slight increase. Do you have any chronic lung disease or kidney disease that is known to you? Also, I see that your serum lipase is a little off, it usually indicates pancreatitis. Are your suffering from any symptoms like abdominal pain, fever, nausea, or vomiting? I suggest you repeat serum lipase.

I am a recovering eating disorder patient and also suffer from GERD, GAD, and low BP (105/60). I saw a cardio two years ago and cleared. I developed a burning, sharp chest pain (more intense than normal GERD pain), in the upper-left sternum just below the manubrium which sent me to the ER. X-ray, bloods, and ECG are normal. I was given an Omeprazole and an antiinflamatory. But, I am still having constant pain, which varies in intensity and improves when I stand. I did lift a heavy rock a few days prior and can feel a slight crunching when I move, but I am really anxious about ischemic heart disease or something more dubious, even though I have no accompanying symptoms besides this pain. Does this sound like costochondritis, or should I be more concerned?","Doctor":"Hello. I passed carefully through your question and would explain that your symptoms are not typical of any cardiac disorders. They could be suggestive of costochondritis or gastro-esophageal reflux. Is the pain triggered by deep breathing or pressure in this chest area? This would be another argument in favor of costochondritis. In such case, it is necessary to perform inflammation tests (PCR, ESR, complete blood count). If the pain is triggered by heavy meals or bending over, it would be indicative of a gastro-esophageal reflux. In such case, it would be necessary to perform a fibrogastroscopy. I would also exclude any possible heart issues, considering your clinical symptomatology for which I would recommend performing an exercise cardiac stress test just to reassure you that your symptoms are not related to your heart. So, just relax and do not worry about it. For more information consult a cardiologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My 77-year-old wife has had constipation issues all her life. This coupled with IBS that generally results in at best small balls of feces. This is day five of no real bowel movement.

Early on use of MiraLax (Polyethylene Glycol) produced nothing followed by two days of Magnesium citrate and still nothing. Finally today, a fleet enema producing small group of balls with mucus. She is currently on Crestor, Tofranil, Fioricet and Lorazepam. Can you share your thoughts regarding this continued bowel movements producing ever-increasing amounts of mucus?","Doctor":"Hi. The mucus usually results from prolonged constipation and has nothing to worry. She needs to take measures to avoid constipation. Have a high fiber diet. Avoid constipating foods.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

(attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Though I would like you to answer a few more questions so as to provide you better diagnosis and suggest appropriate management. Are your menses regular? Is the flow normal, heavy or low? Do you have children? Normal delivery or cesarean sections? Any abortion, miscarriage or D and C done? Any history of urogenital infection or chronic discharge per vaginum? Now coming onto your query and analysis of the images you have sent. First image shows anterverted uterus with a 3.9 mm calcific focus in endometrial region. This calcification is most likely due to earlier infective or inflammatory pathology. Nothing to worry about. Second image shows minimal amount of clear fluid in the endometrial canal with thin endometrium for 9th day of cycle. Third, Fourth and fifth images show an oblong soft tissue structure adjacent to the left ovary. This could either be part of the bowel or fallopian tube (I can differentiate it on a dynamic scan or an ultrasound video rather than a still image). The left ovary looks normal with few follicles seen within it. No obvious cyst is seen in the image provided. Also, the left tube is not dilated and therefore no hydrosalpinx is seen. The last sixth image shows part of normal bowel loop in the right adnexa. No right ovary or dilated tube is seen in the image provided. I hope this helps. Infective - inflammatory.

Tetanus toxoid (TT) has a great role in preventing serious tetanus infection which could occur anywhere and anytime. Moreover, the TT is a weak toxoid with little adverse effects on our bodies. A booster dose is required for all the population every ten years. There is no contraindication in case you are a cancer survivor.

I had felt extremely fatigued for two days, then I felt pain in my center and left side of my chest. My hands seemed numb. I had periodic episodes of cold sweats on the back of my head and neck, as well as a dull ache in my left upper shoulder. The heaviness was there also. This stayed off and on all evening, during which I took two baby Aspirin, which provided a little relief. The next day, I was still very tired and my chest was sore. The pain was sporadic in my chest, like a quick stinging pain. When I tried to do anything, it would try to start again. During this time, my blood pressure reached its highest at 167/112 mmHg. The third day I felt better. I am currently on Zoloft 100 mg once daily. Does this sound like a heart attack? I was terrified.","Doctor":"Hello. Your symptoms are not typical of a heart attack. They seem to indicate musculoskeletal pain or inflammation. Is the pain triggered by deep breathing or body movements? This would be another argument in favor of a musculo-skeletal pain. The increase in blood pressure values during these episodes is a normal physiological reaction to the pain. So, there is nothing to worry about. Anyways, an exercise cardiac stress test would help reassure you that nothing bad is going on. Regarding your blood pressure values, I would recommend you to measure your blood pressure frequently during a week and write those values down.

I read carefully your question and would explain that your symptoms do not seem to be related to multiple sclerosis. So, just relax and do not worry about it. In my opinion, your complaints are related to a possible bulging disc in the lumbar vertebral column, which is causing radiating nerve pain and numbness in the leg. It is also the main cause of back pain. For this reason, it is necessary performing a lumbar column CT scan or MRI to investigate this disorder. Meanwhile, I would recommend having some rest, avoiding prolonged standing up or sitting position.

I have taken two sittings of microdermabrasion and two sittings of glycolic acid peel. But, I am not able to see any change and that too my skin looks darker. Would it be a chemical peel side effect? Now I am using branded face wash and sunscreen in the morning and skin whitening cream during bedtime.","Doctor":"Hi. Microdermabrasion and chemical peel are the procedures to improve skin texture. They exfoliate the damaged superficial layer of skin, there by lightening the hyperpigmentation on the skin. This removes the dead cells in the skin, facilitating the new layer of cells to grow. After the procedure, the key is to use sunscreen round the clock, every four hours. This is because skin needs to be protected from UV rays when it is recovering. UV rays are not only from sun but also from tube lights, TV screen and computer monitor. Once applied, sunscreen protects skin for four hours, hence should be applied every four hours for optimal protection. Now talking about expectations from these cosmetic procedures. They do help to lighten the skin a bit, but, the main purpose of these procedures is to improve the texture, remove the dark pigmentation. This will take minimum four to five sittings to see improvement in skin texture provided proper after care measures are followed like protection from UV rays. I personally explain my patients that it is not skin whitening treatment, because the colour of an individual is genetically programmed. I do not want you to get disheartened. I can totally sense your concern dear, but this is the fact. You will get back your original colour after the procedure, which may be one or two shades lighter than your pre-procedure skin colour. The procedure per say can't make your skin darker, if you have used sunscreen properly as advised by your Dermatologist. Eat healthy, exercise regularly and keep your body hydrated to have a healthy skin.

No one in their family had lung carcinoma. Now he is afraid of any familial risk and occurrence. He is 30 years old now. Is there any investigation to find whether he is at risk or not?","Doctor":"Hello. Lung cancer occurring at 28 years is unusual and he is right to be concerned regarding familial risk. As far as lung cancer is concerned, there is no specific gene or syndrome which is considered familial. But studies have shown that if a family member who had lung cancer and was a non-smoker, the risk of lung cancer in them is high. There are genetic tests available which can detect such mutation and their risk of causing lung cancer. But these tests should be done in a patient who had cancer so we can identify the particular mutation. So that the relatives could be tested for the specific mutation. Most widely known mutation in such cases is EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), which can cause familial lung cancer. If his sister was tested for this and was negative then there is no further need for testing. So even if we do the test in your friend and find some abnormalities, we will not be sure of their significance. It will only add to the anxiety of your friend. What I would recommend right now is to adopt a healthy lifestyle and avoid known risk factors for lung cancer. As some researchers have shown that family history makes you seven to eight times more prone than a normal person if you continue to smoke. Also, if possible, I would like to see the histopathology report of his sister regarding type.

And also, because I was occasionally drinking a few bottles of beer after I had gotten it done, does that mean my healing time has to be longer than six weeks? By the way, I did my acne scar regions with 2.00 mm needles.","Doctor":"Hi. Alcohol use can diminish wound healing, it increases the blood flow so it can also cause bleeding. Excessive alcohol intake also reduces the immunity of the body which can lead to delayed wound healing. Same principle applied to micro needling. Micro needling is also a small type of injuries created in the facial skin so that the healing process makes a healthy smooth skin and remove the scar. So if you take alcohol during that process alcohol is going to affect that healing process and it can lead to infection. So I advise that you should completely avoid alcohol if possible. A small amount of one glass of beer per day can be taken if you cannot control your urge to take alcohol.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, A few months ago, I was not thinking and I hit a door with my hand and it has been a few months since then. I got tests and an MRI done on it and came back fine, just a mild motion artifact they could find, and I do not know what that means. The elbow popping will not go away and my wrists pop sometimes too. I have fallen off my bed and rolled on my ankle and heard a loud crack. that was a few months ago too. My legs pop now as well. I used to weight a lot and lift weights. So, I was pretty buff. I have lost a lot of weight since then. The tests say I have not broken anything but my doctor was talking to a physiotherapist on a TV and he recommended me a 0.1 milligram dose of Risperidone. Would that help with my issues? Also, my mom did have schizophrenia. I am adopted, so I do not live with her anymore. Do you think this is a good idea? I would like your opinion.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your concern. The issue what you are narrating could be due to poor movement control in the joint. Do not worry. I presume that you do not have much of pain and any other issue except popping.  I would suggest: You are talking about motion artifact in your MRI (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Do not worry about that. It is actually hyper-intensified signals of blood flow that can create an imageon the film. You do not have to worry about that. As I told you earlier, if you do regular stretching and strengthening of your upper and lower body, you will be alright. Along with a bit of stability and proprioceptive and balance exercises. Get in touch with me in case if you need any more help in this regard.

I can see that the glucose is within normal reference numbers, but on 60th minute the insulin seems too high. Is it? What are the reference numbers for insulin on the 60th minute? Is this a sign of insulin resistance? What would you recommend as a treatment?","Doctor":"Hello.

In the occipital area). It started a week ago. It comes and goes very quickly, feels like a very intense stabbing feeling, then stops. It can happen a few times or several times in the day. I do not have any other neurological symptoms. I have had occipital neuralgia after a car accident before and have a history of tension headaches and this does not feel like either of those. In the past year I have had an MRI (for vision issues) and I think it was with contrast dye, but I cannot remember. I have also had a CT scan after I had melanoma removed. No dye with that one. I am afraid I have something dangerous in my head because I have this intense, localized, intermittent pain in the same spot.","Doctor":"Hello. Your symptoms are not suggestive of any serious medical disorder (including a brain tumor). You should know that a brain tumor, usually does not cause intermittent sharp pain (which is typical of a nerve pain), but progressive headaches mainly during the night and in laying down position, with nausea in the morning. Other symptoms like blurring vision, gait problems, etc. may be present. So, you can understand that it does not seem to be your case. Occipital neuralgia seems to be the most probable cause of your complaints, although you say to have a different type of pain. Coming to this point, I suggest taking Indomethacin twice daily (if no contraindications) for some days, coupled with an antiacid or PPI (Omeprazole) to protect your stomach. Hope you will find this answer helpful. For more information consult a neurologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have had eczema on the inside of my right hand for about ten years now. It seems like it has slowly started to heal. But now I have a new problem popping up. There are small flesh-colored bumps on my fingers that are multiplying in clusters.

I have them about twenty in number on the palm-side of my fingers, mostly on my ring finger. Do you know what they are?","Doctor":"Hi. I saw your clinical picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You have rough raised slots on your fingers. These are palmar warts. Wart is a virus infection caused by human papilloma virus. This is a contagious condition. It will spread to other sites, if not treated. Spreading of wart depends on your immunity as well. You will have to schedule an appointment with a dermatologist to get rid of them. Treatment options include liquid nitrogen cryotherapy, electrodesiccation, topical TCA (Trichloroacetic acid) application, and topical Salicylic acid and Lactic acid combination. Do get treated as soon as possible. For more information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been experiencing discomfort in my back. Sometimes, I would feel uncomfortable or heavy in my upper and lower back. There is also an extremely loud noise of bones rubbing together. It makes me think that this may be the reason for my poor posture. I find myself slouching all the time as my back feels kind of heavy. What can I do to get rid of this discomfort?","Doctor":"Hello. In my opinion, the pain could also be due to muscular imbalance. As you said, it could be primarily due to bad posture. So improving posture can help you regain normal balance and get rid of pain and discomfort. I suggest you kindly do strengthening exercises for your upper back and neck, core stability, stretches like cobra stretch and hip flexors will help to achieve your goal faster. Until then keep icing your back. Keep stretching chest muscles, cobra stretch and hip mobility exercises. There are a variety of hip mobility exercises available like the fire hydrant, piriformis stretch, hip IR (internal rotation) stretch, etc. For more information consult a physiotherapist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 22-year-old female who was diagnosed with hypothyroidism (genetic) when I was 12. Over the past five years, I have become around 50 pounds overweight and all of my attempts to lose have seemed to fail so I have given up, but my weight has stayed the same. There is so much information put there about losing weight with hypothyroidism but it all seems to conflict. I am so unsure as to what type of exercise and diet I should follow as a result but I still would like to lose weight, but most importantly have my body feel better. What can I do? I am currently on Levothyroxine, Buspar, and Benedryl.","Doctor":"Hi. You have really done well with the hypothyroidism problem. Your levels are normal with less medications which are very good. As it is genetically induced, it is very difficult to lose weight. My advice to you is, you should focus on maintaining normal levels of TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) and try to remain active, having a positive outlook in life. Or else, it will become very difficult to balance your life with the symptoms of hypothyroidism. Even though your weight has not reduced, be very careful in not putting on weight here afterward. Everyday brisk walking for 1 hour. If you have body pain, alternate with exercises and walking. Avoid all kinds of junk foods, processed, bakery products, rich sweets, fatty foods, sodas, alcohol, and smoking. Avoid partying and binge eating. Follow the food timings properly. Have small frequent meals. In between snacks should be strictly fruits or any kind of low-calorie foods. Have unsalted nuts around five daily. It can give a glow to your dry skin. Everyday water intake should be around 1.5-2 liters. You can use flax seeds. Powder it and mix it in your food. It is a fiber which will give you fullness. Use turmeric, fenugreek seeds, or powder every day. It is a good antioxidant and fenugreek helps in reducing cholesterol levels. Include low-fat milk, curd every day.

It has got severe when the quarantine started and I could not schedule anymore consultation. I had taken mucolytic which gave me severe coughing but it released a lot of phlegm yellow or greenish color. I tried calling my friends who are nurses and I got a doctor whom I consulted and gave me prescription of Co-Amoxiclav. I had no fever, chills and night sweats. I have a chest stabbing pain for more than two weeks now. Today, the pain level for me is 5-6 whenever I clear my throat or cough a little. I have taken Co-Amoxiclav 625 mg three times a day for the past one week, but the pain did not go away. But my cough stopped and I had just very few episodes of coughing usually when I wake up. My throat does not hurt or itch anymore but I am more bothered by the chest pain now. The inner pain started before just below my breast on the right, but now it is nearly on the chest itself but still on the right. Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello. The most probable cause for the chest pain, in the setting of the problems described by you, is due to muscle spasm on account of indiscriminate coughing when the infection was present. Now the phlegm is less, signifying decreased infection or healing. What you need are some muscle relaxants and pain killers. Couple this with some balm application locally followed by steam and hot fomentation. Take adequate rest. This shall pass, nothing to worry. If you need any further support or clarifications do not hesitate to contact me."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 26 years, I had a hip resurfacing surgery eight years back.

About 80 % of people with ankylosing spondylitis have HLA B27 positive and only 1 to 4 % people with positive HLA B27 develop ankylosing spondylitis. That means out of 100 people with positive HLA B27 only one to four can develop ankylosing spondylitis and 96 to 99 are normal. The chances of your children to have positive HLA B27 is about 10 %.

First of all, treatment for alcohol addiction and smoking is a self-decision and self will. If he is willing to stop, then you can take help from de-addiction centers for medicines. To reduce alcohol craving, I would suggest Acamprosate along with Etizolam for withdrawal symptoms. For smoking cessation, Buspirone can be helpful.

I have been having some serious anxiety issues from thinking and worrying about this. I have been working in a restaurant for the past one month and been using a backpack to hold my work clothes. The inside of the backpack did not appear or smell dirty, but it has been used for various purposes before. For example, on a few occasions I had used the backpack to go to the gym. I put my workout clothes in a plastic bag first, so I never had dirty clothes touching the inside of the backpack, but I had sometimes put the plastic bag on the changing room floor while changing before putting the plastic bag back in the backpack. I am now really worried that the inside of the backpack was contaminated with some dangerous pathogen, meaning that my work clothes became contaminated, and hence, when I occasionally touched my clothes, I transferred some of those pathogens to my hands. I have become increasingly worried that I might have ultimately infected other people (or caused colonization), especially customers, but I do not know whether it is true or not. How likely is it to be true? And what mitigating steps should I take now, if necessary?","Doctor":"Hi. Clostridium difficile infection is of two types: 1. Symptomatic (causing diarrhea mainly): which is either due to transmission through infected food and contaminated hands or after antibiotic therapy. 2. Asymptomatic carrier (like your case). You have to perform clostridium difficile tests like EIA (enzyme immunoassay) toxin test to confirm that you are a carrier. If the result came positive and you are working in a restaurant, then I suggest you take eradication therapy (Metronidazole 500 mg twice for seven days). Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medications with their consent. In case you are not working in the restaurant, no treatment is required as long as you are asymptomatic. Regarding hepatitis A virus, there is a vaccine that you must take if you are working in a restaurant.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Lastly, there are no visible effects on the skin.","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. You are actually suffering from aquagenic urticaria. Such patients are actually allergic to water content and or temperature changes lead to histamine release thus itching. This condition is most of the time very resistant to treatment.

Take antihistaminic plus Montelukast tablet like Fexofenadine and Montelukast 180 mg daily for four weeks and use calamine lotion. Some people report relief after doing exercise they have an itching for few minutes after sweating due to exercise but during whole of the day then they feel relieved. Different people behave differently according to the level of allergy they have.

We never recommend a continuous dosage of Levothyroxine for three years without checking the levels periodically. So, what is usually done is that we repeat thyroid profile three monthly and adjust the dosage. However, the current scenario warrants stopping the drug for a few weeks till the level comes within the normal range. Once the level falls within the normal range we keep on monitoring the levels. If they increase, we start Levothyroxine again and adjust the dosage three-monthly based on TSH levels. I hope it helps you.

I did some X-ray. Can you interpret it?","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your X-rays indicate changes of spondylitis in the form of disc space reduction and osteophytes. For the symptoms you have, I would recommend an MRI of the lumbar spine with whole spine screening and back strengthening exercises.

I am taking Betacap 20 and Escitalopram daily for this. I have gone through heart checkups and found no other problems. But taking this beta blocker has created mild ED problems. My friend suggested using Zee Ayurveda's Zee Musli premium tablets to take daily for 45 days. Is it safe to take, need your advice.","Doctor":"Hello. ED (erectile dysfunction) is one of the common side effects of beta blockers. It needs to be confirmed that the blood pressure is fairly controlled with current medication. After going through the Zee ayurveda product which you have mentioned, it seems to be good enough for your problem (I have not used it yet in my practice). But it is mentioned that these kind of ayurvedic medicines give their best effects when the digestion of the person is good. So, make sure that your appetite and digestion is appropriate. You can take some ayurvedic preparation to augment digestion like Liv 52 or Livomyn, etc. Other good medicines with good results for ED problem is tablet Shilapravanga (Dhootpapeshwar company), one tablet twice a day with milk.

I am suffering from CKD for the past one year. About one year back, my creatinine was 3. Now it has gradually increased to 5.18. It is my doubt. Once increased, will the creatinine level decrease? 10 days back, it was 4.70 now 5.18. I am taking a diet without salt. There are no any symptom that is, leg swelling, breathing problem, etc. I am taking the following medicines: Evion LC 1-0-0, Ketoadd 2-0-2, Nodosis 1-0-1, Nefrosave Forte 1-0-0, Urimax D 0-0-1, Dytor 10 1-1-0 Inj. I want to avoid dialysis. Are the medicines fine? Please advise me.","Doctor":"Hello. Since your creatinine has gradually increased over a period of a year, it will not decrease. In acute settings, like some infection or diarrhea, creatinine will temporarily rise and then comes down. But, in your case, it is a progression of the disease itself. So, it is unlikely to come down significantly. Next thing, a slight increase in creatinine also occurs on initiation of diuretics (Dytor) medicine which will increase your urine output. If your Dytor is initiated recently then it might have caused a slight recent elevation in creatinine. This elevation does not occur due to damage to the kidney but has a different mechanism and there is no need to stop Dytor for it solely. Probably you are not having any symptoms since you are taking Dytor which will prevent edema or fluid accumulation in lungs. So, no shortness of breath. Your medicines are fine. Keep a check on the BP and it should be strictly under control (less than 130/85). Also, avoid unnecessary medicines like pain-killers, Ayurvedic medicines, etc. And, obviously, sugars should be under control. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts.

I noticed for about a month now that my sperm has become yellowish gray. So, I recently went for semen analysis and the result was that I have Staphylococcus epidermidis in my semen. Please, what antibiotic can I use?","Doctor":"Hello. Bacteria in semen may cause decreased quality of sperm in it or bacterial toxin may affect the viability of sperm. But to be sure, the bacterial presence in semen must be confirmed as not from contamination from skin. Staphylococcus epidermidis is a very common bacteria staying in our skin. So, during the process of collection of semen, you may create situations where you accidentally contaminate your sample from your own source, that is, your body with the not so harmful organisms living on your skin. I think you can repeat the test and along with that, you do a routine checking of your semen, that is, semen analysis so that you can be assured that your semen contains an adequate number of viable sperms. You did not mention your marital status or having any child. I guess you are little worried about the change of color of your semen. I suggest you follow the proper steps before collecting semen for culture and analysis and then if it is proved that your semen sample is not contaminated, then we can suggest an antibiotic.

(I also know this can be indicative of an appendix problem but it is where I always have pain with tummy troubles and it is not my appendix). This is not uncommon as I have digestive issues kind of often. However, this time is different. I have had pale, clay-colored stools and some pain in my right flank for going on five days. It feels a bit more sore on my right side after a bowel movement. I went to the ER, my blood work indicates no problem and is normal across the board, no infection, normal pancreatic enzymes and liver enzymes, normal bilirubin and I had a had a scan of the biliary ducts and they appear normal. I have two gallstones that are not blocking anything and there is no indication of inflammation of my gallbladder.

Does drinking a lot of water, gargling with salt water, taking tablespoons of honey each day, and getting a lot of sleep remove it fast and also prevent it in the first place? Also, what are the best and quickest natural ways to get rid of inflammation fast and prevent it from happening in the first place from then on? If able you can also share medicines that are for it. I am also curious as to whether dust can cause allergies that can lead to inflammation. I am trying to learn more about health and medical care. This has been only recent and I would say it is rather mild. I realize each time it occurs it is in the spring or if I have not been eating healthy and enough, not getting enough consistent sleep, and areas of my home have dust, especially since I have been inside at home for the past three weeks straight. Checking in if I am doing the right things to properly take care of it.","Doctor":"Hello. All the habits of water, honey, etc., are helpful. No doubt about it. One more thing if you can do is put almond oil (provided you are not allergic to almonds) 0.5 ml in each nostril for two to three days. It really works well. I personally vouch for it. You will sleep better too. As you said it is seasonal so allergic components will be there. So you will require the following for proper resolution. Take one tablet Montelukast 10 mg, Levocetirizine 5 mg once a day in the evening as it causes little drowsiness. Montelukast is available as Singulair 10 mg. Levocetirizine is available as Xyzal 5 mg. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.
