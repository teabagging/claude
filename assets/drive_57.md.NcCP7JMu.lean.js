From the first property ( f(9 + x) = f(9 - x) ), we can rewrite it as:   [   f(9 + (x - 9)) = f(9 - (x - 9)) implies f(x) = f(18 - x)   ]   This shows that ( f ) is symmetric about ( x = 9 ).3. From the second property ( f(x - 10) = f(-x - 10) ), we can rewrite it as:   [   f((x + 10) - 10) = f(-(x + 10) - 10) implies f(x) = f(-x - 20)   ]   This shows that ( f ) is symmetric about ( x = -10 ).4. Combining these symmetries, we get:   [   f(x) = f(18 - x) = f(x - 38)   ]   This implies that ( f ) has a period of 38.5. Since ( f ) is periodic with period 38, we can find the zeros of ( f ) within the interval ([0, 2014]). Given ( f(0) = 0 ), we have:   [   f(38n) = 0 quad text{for all integers } n   ]   and since ( f(x) = f(18 - x) ), we also have:   [   f(38n + 18) = 0 quad text{for all integers } n   ]6.

Move one of the diagonals so that one of its endpoints coincides with one of the endpoints of the other diagonal. It is reasonable to choose B-mathrm{t} or C as the coinciding endpoint, because from these points, the desired quadrilateral has 2-2 known length sides, while from A and D, only 1-1.Move the A C diagonal by overrightarrow{A B} to the B C^{prime} position (1st figure).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_e50b143cdeb4253b6875g-1.jpg?height=653&width=916&top_left_y=400&top_left_x=580)1st figureThus, the D point can be obtained by rotating C^{prime} around B by 90^{circ}, and we know the distances of both points from B and C. Therefore, by fixing C and B at the given distance from each other, we can draw two geometric loci for the points C^{prime} and D: the circle k_{1} with radius A B and the circle k_{2} with radius C D centered at C, as well as their 90^{circ} rotated versions around B, k_{2}^{*} and k_{1}^{*}, in opposite directions. (In the figure, the center of k_{1}^{*} is C^{*}, and k_{2}^{*} can be omitted.) Then D is one of the intersection points of k_{2} and k_{2}^{*}, from which C^{prime} can be obtained by a 90^{circ} reverse rotation on k_{1}, and finally A by translating B by overrightarrow{C^{prime} C}.Given the required dimensions, k_{2} and k_{1}^{*} intersect at two points, one of which results in a convex quadrilateral (1st figure), which is the correct one; the other (2nd figure, C^{*}, D_{2}, and A_{2}) is concave, which does not meet the criteria.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_e50b143cdeb4253b6875g-1.jpg?height=339&width=415&top_left_y=1554&top_left_x=844)2nd figureb) We calculate the lengths of the diagonals only in the case of the 1st figure, based on the completed construction. In the triangle B D C^{*}, C^{*} D=2, C^{*} B=4, and the angle between them is 45^{circ} larger than the angle at C^{*} in the triangle C D C^{*}. In the latter triangle, C C^{*}=4 sqrt{2}, socos C C^{*} D varangle=frac{(4 sqrt{2})^{2}+2^{2}-6^{2}}{2 cdot 4 sqrt{2} cdot 2}=0,the angle is 90^{circ}, henceB D^{2}=B C^{* 2}+C^{*} D^{2}-2 B C^{*} cdot C^{*} D cos 135^{circ}=20+8 sqrt{2},B D=5.596 text { units. }II.

From the assumptions,P Q=frac{1}{2} A C=frac{1}{2} B D=Q R quad text { and } quad P Q R varangle=90^{circ}because P Q|A C perp B D| Q R.

We use the fact that in any scaled version of our figure, B^{*} P^{*}: B^{*} Q^{*}=1: 2 and C^{*} Q^{*}: C^{*} R^{*}=2: 3, so B^{*} is on the Apollonian circle k_{b} of the point pair P^{*}, Q^{*} in the ratio 1: 2, C^{*} is on the Apollonian circle k_{c} of the point pair Q^{*}, R^{*} in the ratio 2: 3, and C^{*} is the reflection of B^{*} over Q^{*}, so C^{*} is also on the reflection k_{b}^{prime} of k_{b} over Q^{*} (3rd figure).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_e50b143cdeb4253b6875g-2.jpg?height=705&width=594&top_left_y=306&top_left_x=749)3rd figureThus, the intersection point of k_{c} and k_{b}^{prime} is C^{*}, its reflection over R^{*} is D^{*}, the reflection of Q^{*} is B^{*}, and the image of B^{*} over P^{*} is A^{*}. Finally, we scale the quadrilateral A^{*} B^{*} C^{*} D^{*} appropriately.The calculation of the diagonals can also be performed based on this construction, for example, in a coordinate system where the origin is Q^{*}, and the axes pass through P^{*} and R^{*}.III. Solution for part b) of the problem. Let the length of the diagonals be d, their intersection point be M, and one of their parts be M C=x, M B=y, where due to convexity 0<x<d and 0<y<d. For these,begin{aligned}(d-x)^{2}+y^{2} & =4 x^{2}+y^{2} & =16 x^{2}+(d-y)^{2} & =36end{aligned}Subtracting (2) from (1) and (3), we get first-degree equations for x and y, and from them,x=frac{d^{2}+12}{2 d}, quad y=frac{d^{2}-20}{2 d}Substituting these into (2), we get a quadratic equation for d^{2}:d^{4}-40 d^{2}+272=0, quad d^{2}=20 pm 8 sqrt{2}The smaller root of d^{2} would give a negative y according to (4), which we cannot use.

When one bag was lost, the remaining number of ingots became a multiple of 4. The number 91 gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, so the lost bag must have contained either 3, 7, or 11 ingots. From the condition, we know that the bags with 3 and 11 ingots are still in place, so the bag with 7 ingots was lost, leaving 84 ingots.Thus, each jeweler received 21 ingots and 3 bags.The first jeweler needs two bags with a total of 20 ingots (since he already has one bag with 1 ingot).

The number of pheasants shot on the first day and the total catch on the third day, on the one hand, provide a lower limit, as the three hunters collectively shot at least 4 of each type of game every day - Károly and Mihály one each, and László two each; thus, the value of the mentioned total is at least 4+3 cdot 4=16. On the other hand, the total is obtained by subtracting the number of deer and foxes shot on the first day, as well as the total number of game shot on the second day, from the entire catch: 86-(12+14)-44=16. This means that on the third day, their catch of each type of game was the smallest number according to the conditions, so Mihály shot 1 fox on that day.Imre Bárány (Budapest, Corvin Mátyás Gymn. II. grade)II. solution. The group collectively shot at least 4 pheasants each day, - Mihály and Károly one each, and László two, so the total number of pheasants shot during the entire hunt was at least 12. On the other hand, this number is exactly 12, so no hunter shot more pheasants on any day than the minimum number indicated by the data. Thus, on the first day, they shot 4 pheasants, and the entire catch was 4+12+14=30 game. Therefore, the result on the third day is 86-(30+44)=12 game. The same reasoning applies to the minimum number of deer and foxes shot each day, so on the third day, no hunter shot more of any type of game than the minimum number; thus, Mihály shot 1 fox on that day.György Darvas (Budapest, Radnóti M.

Therefore, the proportion of Sundays when a quarrel occurs between the spouses for at least one reason is1 / 3+1 / 3-1 / 9=5 / 9Thus, the proportion of Sundays that pass without such family quarrels is only1-5 / 9=4 / 9"},{"problem":"## Problem StatementFind the point of intersection of the line and the plane.begin{aligned}& frac{x-1}{1}=frac{y}{0}=frac{z+3}{2} & 2 x-y+4 z=0end{aligned}","solution":"## SolutionLet's write the parametric equations of the line.begin{aligned}& frac{x-1}{1}=frac{y}{0}=frac{z+3}{2}=t Rightarrow & left{begin{array}{l}x=1+t y=0 z=-3+2 tend{array}right.end{aligned}Substitute into the equation of the plane:2(1+t)-0+4(-3+2 t)=02+2 t+0-12+8 t=010 t-10=0t=1Find the coordinates of the intersection point of the line and the plane:left{begin{array}{l}x=1+1=2 y=0 z=-3+2 cdot 1=-1end{array}right.We get:(2 ; 0 ;-1)## Problem Kuznetsov Analytic Geometry 14-4"},{"problem":"Consider all lines which meet the graph of y=2x^4+7x^3+3x-5 in four distinct points, say (x_i,y_i), i=1,2,3,4.

Let's introduce the following notations: a - the side of the base, b - the lateral edge, N - the midpoint of side AB, M - the midpoint of side AD, K - the midpoint of edge SC of the regular quadrilateral pyramid SABCD.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_f36d8ea35c99389d52e3g-05.jpg?height=1057&width=680&top_left_y=1156&top_left_x=745)We construct the section of the pyramid SABCD by a plane passing through points N and M and parallel to the median DK of the lateral face SDC: through points N and M we draw the line NM until it intersects with lines BC and CD at points N_1 and M_1 respectively; through point M_1 we draw a line parallel to the median DK, the points of intersection of this line with edges SD and SC are denoted as P and R respectively; we connect points R and N_1; the point of intersection of RN_1 and SB is denoted as Q; we connect Q and N, P and M. The section NMPRQ is constructed. Let's find its area.By the condition, AM = MD = AN = NB = frac{a}{2}. Therefore, triangle AMN is a right isosceles triangle and MN = frac{a}{sqrt{2}}. Note that triangles MDM_1 and NBN_1 are right triangles. They are equal to triangle AMN by the leg and angle. Therefore, M_1D = N_1B = frac{a}{2}. Consider the plane of the lateral face SDC. Since M_1R parallel DK, then frac{RK}{CK} = frac{M_1D}{CD} = frac{1}{2}. Then RK = frac{CK}{2} = frac{b}{4}, SR = SK - RK = frac{b}{4}. Moreover, PR parallel DK, frac{SP}{PD} = frac{SR}{RK} = 1. Therefore, SP = PD = frac{b}{2}. Since P is the midpoint of edge SD and M is the midpoint of base AD, then PM is the midline of triangle ADS and PM = frac{AS}{2} = frac{b}{2}, PM parallel AS. Similarly, we can obtain that QN = frac{AS}{2} = frac{b}{2}, QN parallel AS. Therefore, quadrilateral PMQN is a parallelogram. We will prove that it is a rectangle. Indeed, the projection of AC of edge AS is the diagonal of the square ABCD. Therefore, AC is perpendicular to the diagonal BD, and since BD parallel MN, then AC is perpendicular to MN. Hence, AS is perpendicular to MN. Since PM parallel AS, it follows that PM is perpendicular to MN. Thus, the section NMPRQ consists of a rectangle PMQN with sides MN = frac{a}{sqrt{2}} and PM = frac{b}{2} and an isosceles triangle PQR with base PQ = frac{b}{2} and height RF. Let's find the area of the rectangle: MN cdot PM = frac{ab}{2sqrt{2}}. Since frac{CR}{RS} = frac{CO}{OA} = 3, then frac{OR}{AS} = frac{CO}{OA} = frac{3}{4}. From this, we get OR = frac{3b}{4}, and FR = frac{3b}{4} - frac{b}{2} = frac{b}{4}. Then the area of triangle PQR is frac{1}{2} cdot frac{a}{sqrt{2}} cdot frac{b}{4} = frac{ab}{8sqrt{2}}. The area of the section NMPRQ is: frac{ab}{2sqrt{2}} + frac{ab}{8sqrt{2}} = frac{5ab}{8sqrt{2}} = frac{5absqrt{2}}{16}.

In how many ways can all natural numbers from 1 to 2 n be arranged in a circle so that each number is a divisor of the sum of its two neighboring numbers?

Note that if the numbers in the circle do not alternate in parity, then some two even numbers are adjacent. An even number is a divisor of the sum of the even number adjacent to it and the second adjacent number, which means the latter is also even. Continuing this reasoning around the circle, we get that all numbers in the circle are even, which is incorrect. Consider the number 2n-1. By the proven fact, both of its neighbors are even, and their sum is divisible by 2n-1, so the sum is at least 4n-2. The maximum sum of the two remaining numbers is 2n + (2n-2) = 4n-2. Therefore, the numbers adjacent to 2n-1 are 2n and 2n-2. Without loss of generality, let them be in descending order clockwise. Now and further, the situation will be as follows: around the circle, the numbers from 2n to k are already placed in descending order clockwise, where k>1. One of the neighbors of the number k is k+1, and the other neighbor is no more than k-1, so the sum of the adjacent numbers is greater than k and no more than 2k, which means it is equal to 2k. It turns out that the next number after k is k-1. We again get the situation described above.

Then, by the Law of Sines, the radius of the circle R is frac{B C}{2 sin 60^{circ}}=frac{sqrt{28}}{sqrt{3}}. The angle A_{2} O C is a central angle, so it is twice the angle A_{2} A C, which is given as 30^{circ}, hence angle A_{2} O C=60^{circ}. Therefore, the area of triangle O A_{2} C is frac{sqrt{3}}{4} cdot R^{2}=frac{7}{sqrt{3}}.The angle bisector of a triangle divides the opposite side proportionally to the other two sides, so A_{1} C: A_{1} B=A C: A B=6: 4, from which A_{1} C=frac{3}{5} B C=frac{3}{5} sqrt{28}.

We now prove that f is a one-to-one correspondence.For two different 5-person groups a_{1} and a_{2} in set A, the locks b_{1}(=f(a_{1})) and b_{2}(=f(a_{2})) they correspond to must be different. Otherwise, if b_{1}=b_{2}, then when both 5-person groups a_{1} and a_{2} (at least 6 proposition committee members) are present, they still cannot open lock b_{1}, which contradicts the problem statement.

Note that when moving through the palace, one always moves from a white room to a black room and vice versa.If n is odd:In total, there are frac{n^{2}+1}{2} black rooms and frac{n^{2}-1}{2} white rooms. Since each white room has been visited exactly p times and the person always leaves a white room to enter a black room, the total number of transitions from a white room to a black room during the walk is p frac{n^{2}-1}{2}.However, if we eliminate the first entry into the northwest corner room (coming from outside), this corresponds to the total number of visits to black rooms during the walk. The northwest corner room has then been visited only once.

We are given ( k > 1 ) distinct primes ( p_1 < p_2 < cdots < p_k ) and an integer ( n ) such that    [   p_1^2 + p_2^2 + cdots + p_k^2 = 2^n.   ]   Let ( S_k ) be the sum on the left-hand side of the equation. We need to find the smallest ( k ) such that ( S_k = 2^n ).2. First, consider the smallest possible sum of squares of two distinct primes:   [   2^2 + 3^2 = 4 + 9 = 13.   ]   Since ( 13 ) is not a power of ( 2 ), ( k ) must be greater than ( 2 ).3. Next, consider the sum of squares of three distinct primes:   [   2^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 = 4 + 9 + 25 = 38.   ]   Since ( 38 ) is not a power of ( 2 ), ( k ) must be greater than ( 3 ).4. Now, consider the sum of squares of four distinct primes:   [   2^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 = 4 + 9 + 25 + 49 = 87.   ]   Since ( 87 ) is not a power of ( 2 ), ( k ) must be greater than ( 4 ).5. Consider the sum of squares of five distinct primes:   [   2^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 + 11^2 = 4 + 9 + 25 + 49 + 121 = 208.   ]   Since ( 208 ) is not a power of ( 2 ), we need to check further.6. We need to find a combination of five primes whose squares sum to a power of ( 2 ). Let's try replacing ( 11 ) with the next prime ( 13 ):   [   2^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 + 13^2 = 4 + 9 + 25 + 49 + 169 = 256.   ]   Since ( 256 = 2^8 ), we have found a valid combination.7.

The discriminant Delta is given by Delta = b^{2}-4ac, where a=1, b=-(2k+2), and c=2k+1.Substituting these values into the formula for Delta, we get:[begin{align*}Delta &= [-(2k+2)]^{2}-4times 1times (2k+1) &= (2k+2)^{2}-4(2k+1) &= 4k^{2}+8k+4-8k-4 &= 4k^{2}.end{align*}]Since 4k^{2} geq 0 for all real values of k, it follows that Delta geq 0.

Restate the problem with general ( n ):   We need to determine the maximum number of colors that can be used to color the integers in the set ({1, 2, 3, ldots, n}) such that for all positive integers (a) and (b) with (a + b leq n), the numbers (a), (b), and (a + b) are not colored with three different colors.2. Propose the maximum number of colors:   We claim that the maximum number of colors that can be used is (lfloor log_2 n rfloor + 1).3. Construct a coloring scheme:   - Let (k = lfloor log_2 n rfloor + 1).   - Define the colors as (C_1, C_2, ldots, C_k).   - Assign color (C_i) to an integer (m) if the first 1 in the binary representation of (m) appears (i) places from the right. For example, (20 = 10100_2) is assigned color (C_3).4. Verify the construction:   - Consider two integers (a) and (b) with different colors. Without loss of generality, assume (a) has color (C_i) and (b) has color (C_j) with (i < j).   - The sum (a + b) will have the first 1 in its binary representation at the same position as the smaller of (a) or (b), ensuring that (a + b) has the same color as one of (a) or (b).5. Prove the upper bound using induction:   - Base Case: For (n = 1), (lfloor log_2 1 rfloor + 1 = 1), and we can use only one color.   - For (n = 2) and (n = 3), (lfloor log_2 2 rfloor + 1 = 2) and (lfloor log_2 3 rfloor + 1 = 2), respectively. We can use at most 2 colors.   - Induction Hypothesis: Assume the statement is true for (n) such that (lfloor log_2 n rfloor = k). That is, we can use at most (k + 1) colors.   - Induction Step: Consider (n) such that (2^k leq n < 2^{k+1}). We need to show that for (2n) and (2n + 1), we can use at most (k + 2) colors.     - Suppose we have a valid coloring for ({1, 2, ldots, n}) using (k + 1) colors.     - For (n + 1 leq m leq 2n), if (m) is assigned a new color, then for any (m + 1 leq p leq 2n), (p) cannot be assigned a new color because (m, p, p - m) would have different colors, violating the condition.     - Thus, we can add at most one new color, making the total (k + 2) colors.6. Conclusion:   - By induction, the maximum number of colors that can be used for any (n) is (lfloor log_2 n rfloor + 1).The final answer is (lfloor log_2 2020 rfloor + 1 = 10 + 1 = boxed{11})."},{"problem":"9.

Mark a point N on the segment MC such that NM = BL. Since triangle LKM is isosceles, the angles KLM and KML at its base are equal. Therefore, the adjacent angles KLB and KMN are also equal. This implies the equality of triangles BKL and NKM by the second criterion of triangle congruence. Thus, angle KNB = angle KBL = 60^{circ}, meaning triangle BKN is also equilateral.To solve part a), note that from the congruence of the triangles, it follows that angle MKN = angle BKL = 10^{circ}.

Then MC = MN + NC = BL + KA = 2 + 3 = 5.Second solution. Draw the altitude KF in triangle LKM. Since this triangle is isosceles, this altitude is also the bisector and median. Then, by the sum of the angles in triangle BKF, we find that angle BKF = 180^{circ} - angle KBF - angle KFB = 30^{circ}. Then angle LKF = angle BKF - angle BKL = 30^{circ} - 10^{circ} = 20^{circ}. Since KF is the bisector of angle LKM, we get that angle FKM = angle FKL = 20^{circ}. Then angle AKM = 180^{circ} - angle BKL - angle LKF - angle FKM = 180^{circ} - 10^{circ} - 20^{circ} - 20^{circ} = 130^{circ}.To solve part b), let the segment LF be denoted by x. Then, since BF is the median of triangle LKM, FM = FL = x. On the other hand, it is known that in a triangle with angles 30^{circ}, 60^{circ}, 90^{circ}, the side opposite the 30^{circ} angle is half the hypotenuse.

Define the function and sequence:   Let ( f(x) = 1 + lnleft(frac{x^2}{1 + ln x}right) ). The sequence is defined as ( x_1 = a ) and ( x_{n+1} = f(x_n) ) for ( n geq 1 ).2.

Verify the bounds of ( f'(x) ):   We need to show ( 0 < f'(x) leq 1 ) for ( x geq 1 ):   [   1 + 2ln x leq x(1 + ln x)   ]   Define ( g(x) = x(1 + ln x) - (1 + 2ln x) ). Compute ( g'(x) ):   [   g'(x) = (1 + ln x) + x cdot frac{1}{x} - frac{2}{x} = 1 + ln x + 1 - frac{2}{x} = 2 + ln x - frac{2}{x}   ]   For ( x geq 1 ), ( g'(x) geq 0 ) because ( ln x geq 0 ) and ( -frac{2}{x} geq -2 ). Since ( g(1) = 0 ), ( g(x) geq 0 ) for ( x geq 1 ). Thus, ( 1 + 2ln x leq x(1 + ln x) ).4. Show the sequence is decreasing and bounded below:   [   x_{k+1} = f(x_k) = 1 + lnleft(frac{x_k^2}{1 + ln x_k}right)   ]   Since ( f'(x) leq 1 ), ( f(x) ) is non-increasing. Also, ( x_{k+1} leq x_k ) implies the sequence is decreasing. Since ( x_k geq 1 ), the sequence is bounded below by 1.5. Convergence and limit:   Since ( {x_n} ) is decreasing and bounded below, it converges to some limit ( L ). At the limit:   [   L = 1 + lnleft(frac{L^2}{1 + ln L}right)   ]   Solve for ( L ):   [   L = 1 + lnleft(frac{L^2}{1 + ln L}right)   ]   Assume ( L = 1 ):   [   1 = 1 + lnleft(frac{1^2}{1 + ln 1}right) = 1 + lnleft(frac{1}{1}right) = 1 + ln 1 = 1   ]   Thus, ( L = 1 ) is a solution. Since the function ( f(x) ) is strictly decreasing for ( x geq 1 ), the limit must be unique.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ 1 } )"},{"problem":"1. On the board, there is a positive integer n. In one step, we can erase the number on the board and write either its double, or its double increased by 1. For how many initial numbers n different from 2019 can we achieve that the number 2019 appears on the board after a finite number of steps?(Josef Tkadlec)","solution":"1. In one step, the current natural number k is increased either to the even number m=2k, or to the odd number m=2k+1. Depending on the parity of the new number m, we can reconstruct the previous number k: either k=m/2, or k=(m-1)/2 — depending on whether m is even or odd.The odd number 2019 will thus appear on the board only after the number (2019-1)/2=1009. Since this is again an odd number, after two steps we will reach the target number 2019 only from the number (1009-1)/2=504. This is an even number, so after three steps we get 2019 only from the number 504/2=252, etc. The entire process of determining all suitable numbers from the final 2019 leads to the following result:2019 leftarrow 1009 leftarrow 504 leftarrow 252 leftarrow 126 leftarrow 63 leftarrow 31 leftarrow 15 leftarrow 7 leftarrow 3 leftarrow 1 .(The number 1 is the smallest natural number, so we do not continue further.)Answer. There are ten such initial values of the number n (they are 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 126, 252, 504, and 1009).Alternative Solution. If we write the numbers on the board in binary, each modification of the current number n consists in not erasing the number at all, but simply appending a zero (changing n to 2n) or a one (changing n to 2n+1) to the right of its representation. The number 2019 will thus be obtained after a certain number of steps precisely from such numbers whose binary representation is formed by the first few digits of the binary representation of the number 2019. Since 2^{10}=1024<2019<2048=2^{11}, the binary representation of the number 2019 has exactly 11 digits, so there are a total of 10 initial numbers n from which we get the number 2019 after one or more steps. (The smallest of these numbers is the number 1, which corresponds to the first digit of the binary representation of the number 2019; the problem does not ask for the other nine numbers.)Note. The binary representation of the number 2019 itself does not concern us; we usually find it precisely by the sequence of modifications described in the first solution. Thus, the binary representation 11111100011 of the number 2019 is obtained when in the obtained sequence of numbers 1, 3, 7, ldots, 1009, 2019 we replace each odd number with a one and each even number with a zero.For a complete solution, award 6 points, of which 4 points for a general justification that each previous number is determined by the following number, 1 point for finding all numbers down to the unit, and 1 point for formulating the correct conclusion.The general description in the first paragraph of the solution is not necessary (nor is the final note about the smallest natural number 1); the solver can start the backward process directly by determining the number 1009 from the number 2009 and continue further. However, if they make a numerical error in the step-by-step calculations, do not award more than 4 points. If they make multiple errors, award no more than 3 points. For solutions that found 1009 but did not continue searching for other numbers, award 1 point.In the case of the second solution, award 1 point for describing the behavior of the operation times 2 and 1 point for describing the behavior of the operation times 2+1 in binary.

Each S_i can take 2^5 = 32 possible values, so there are 32 times 32 = 1024 possible pairs (S_1, S_2).   By symmetry and independence, the probability that |S_1 - S_2| > frac{1}{2} is the same as the probability that |S_1 - S_2| leq frac{1}{2}.8.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the expected area of the projection of a unit cube onto a plane, where the direction of projection is uniformly random.2. Surface Area of the Cube:   The surface area of a unit cube is (6) square units.3. Equivalent Sphere:   We consider a sphere with the same surface area as the cube. The surface area of a sphere is given by (4pi r^2). Setting this equal to the surface area of the cube, we have:   [   4pi r^2 = 6 implies r^2 = frac{3}{2pi} implies r = sqrt{frac{3}{2pi}}   ]4.

In particular, B Q, B C, B D and C D all have length 3 sqrt{2}.Next, if we extract triangle B C D, then and draw the medians B X and C Y which intersect at G, then we see that triangle B G Y is a 30-60-90 triangle, so B G=frac{2}{sqrt{3}}(B Y)=frac{2}{sqrt{3}}left(frac{1}{2}(B A)right)=frac{1}{sqrt{3}}(3 sqrt{2})=sqrt{6}. This tells us that the distance from the axis of the cone to the points where the cube touches the cone is sqrt{6}.We can now calculate the distance from T to the plane containing B, C and D. To do, this we look at a partial cross-section of the cone labelling B, T, G, as well as O, the centre of the base of the cone, and S, the remaining vertex of the cross-section.We can see that triangle T G B is similar to triangle T O S, so frac{T G}{T O}=frac{G B}{O S} or T G=24left(frac{sqrt{6}}{4}right)=6 sqrt{6},(since the radius of the base of the cone is 4).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_20_33a8a6559d675f59baa2g-235.jpg?height=934&width=604&top_left_y=1190&top_left_x=1278)Lastly, we need to calculate the distance A G. To do this, we can calculate A Q and Q G and subtract these two distances.A Q is the main diagonal of the cube, so A Q=sqrt{3^{2}+3^{2}+3^{2}}=3 sqrt{3}.Looking at triangle B G Q, which is right-angled, we see thatQ G=sqrt{B Q^{2}-B G^{2}}=sqrt{(3 sqrt{2})^{2}-(sqrt{6})^{2}}=2 sqrt{3}.Therefore, A G=A Q-Q G=sqrt{3}.Therefore, the required distance is T A=T G-A G=6 sqrt{6}-sqrt{3}.Answer: (A)"},{"problem":"If a positive integer can be expressed as the difference of the squares of two positive integers, then this positive integer is called a \\"wise number\\" (e.g., 3=2^{2}-1^{2}, 16=5^{2}-3^{2}).

Define ( n )-acceptable group:   A group of ( k ) boys is ( n )-acceptable if removing any boy from the group leaves a group of ( k-1 ) boys in which there is always a group of ( n ) boys who all know each other.2. Consider the function ( f(A) ):   For a group ( A ) of ( 2n-1 ) boys, let ( f(A) ) be the number of complete ( n )-graphs (i.e., groups of ( n ) boys who all know each other) within that group.3. Minimal counterexample:   Assume there is a counterexample for some ( n ). Choose the counterexample with the minimal ( f(A) = k ). This means that in this group of ( 2n-1 ) boys, there are exactly ( k ) complete ( n )-graphs.4. Non-empty intersection property:   For any ( k-1 ) complete ( n )-graphs, there must be a non-empty intersection.

Conclusion:   By the properties of ( n )-acceptable groups and the minimal counterexample argument, we can conclude that the largest ( k ) such that any ( k )-boy group that is ( n )-acceptable must contain a group of ( n+1 ) boys who all know each other is ( k = 2n-1 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ k = 2n-1 } )."},{"problem":"Given the power function f(x) = (m + 2)x^{m^2 + m - 2}, let a = log_5 4, b = log_{frac{1}{5}} frac{1}{3}, and c = 0.5^{-0.2}.

This also holds for repeatedly flipping an even number of cards, such as repeatedly flipping 20 cards.However, since r-s=37-19=18 is not divisible by 4, it is impossible to achieve a situation where all cards show their red side from the initial situation.b) The cards with the blue side visible at the beginning are cards numbered 1 to 9, while cards numbered 10 to 37 show their red side.

Since the latter number is an integer, then x=3 n, where n in N. Therefore, the initial quantities of all three types of packages are 3 n, 4 n, 6 n respectively.After sales and deliveries, the quantity of superior chalk became (1+0.8) 6 n=frac{54 n}{5}, and the quantity of unusual chalk became frac{54 n}{5} cdot frac{5}{2}=frac{27 n}{4} packages. These numbers are integers, so they are divisible by 4 and 5, that is, n=20 m, where m in N. The number of packages of regular chalk will be frac{27 n}{20} cdot 2=frac{27 n}{10}. Considering the condition of the problem (the number of packages of regular chalk decreased by no more than 10 packages), we get 0<3 n-frac{27 n}{10}=(60-54) m=6 m leq 10.

To prove the latter property, assume that some three circles have a common point Q. Then the centers of these three circles would lie on the circumference of a unit circle centered at Q, which is impossible since the centers of the five circles are collinear.Now color the five centers red and the intersection points blue. Any two circles have two blue (intersection) points, which uniquely determine the two circles, so the number of blue points is 2 cdot binom{5}{2} = 20. The conditions of the problem are thus satisfied by 20 unit circles whose centers are the blue points. Therefore, the number of blue points can be 20.We will show that more than 20 is not possible. With more than 20 blue points, there could be at most 4 red points. However, only points that are the intersection points of the unit circles drawn around the red points can be blue, since otherwise they could not be at a unit distance from at least two red points. However, four circles can have at most 2 cdot binom{4}{2} = 12 intersection points (any two circles can have at most two). Therefore, with at most 4 red points, there can be at most 12 blue points, which is clearly a contradiction.With this, we are done: we have shown that there cannot be more than 20 blue points, and we have provided an example with 20.Hegedüs Dániel (Budapesti Fazekas M.

If x_{0}=frac{u}{v} is a root, where u and v are relatively prime integers, then after substituting x_{0} and multiplying by v^{3}: 0 cdot v^{3}=u^{3}-a u^{2} v+b c u v^{2}-c v^{3}=u^{3}-vleft(a u^{2}-b c u v+c v^{2}right). Since (u ; v)=1, u^{3} and v are also relatively prime, but the above equality implies that v divides u^{3}. This is only possible if v= pm 1, which means x_{0}=frac{u}{v} is an integer.Therefore, the sought p, q, r numbers are positive integers whose sum, product, and reciprocal sum are all integers. The sum and product are always integers, so we need to examine when frac{1}{p}+frac{1}{q}+frac{1}{r} is also an integer. Let p leq q leq r. If 3 leq p, then0<frac{1}{p}+frac{1}{q}+frac{1}{r} leq frac{1}{3}+frac{1}{3}+frac{1}{3}=1thus the reciprocal sum is an integer only if equality holds, i.e., p=q=r=3. If p=2, then0<frac{1}{p}+frac{1}{q}+frac{1}{r} leq frac{3}{2}, quad text { therefore } quad frac{1}{p}+frac{1}{q}+frac{1}{r}=1from whichfrac{1}{q}+frac{1}{r}=frac{1}{2}, quad(q-2)(r-2)=4so q=r=4, or q=3, r=6. Finally, if p=1, then0<frac{1}{q}+frac{1}{r} leq 2, quad text { so } quad frac{1}{q}+frac{1}{r}has a value of 1 or 2, from which q=r=2, or q=r=1 respectively.Therefore, all the suitable (p ; q ; r) triples, disregarding the order of the numbers, are the following: (1 ; 1 ; 1), (1 ; 2 ; 2),(2 ; 4 ; 4),(2 ; 3 ; 6) and (3 ; 3 ; 3)."},{"problem":"Given three vectors overset{⇀}{a}, overset{⇀}{b}, and overset{⇀}{c} in the same plane, where overset{⇀}{a} =(2,1).(1) If |overset{⇀}{c}|=2 sqrt{5}, and overset{⇀}{c} perp overset{⇀}{a}, find the coordinates of overset{⇀}{c};(2) If |overset{⇀}{b}|= frac{ sqrt{5}}{2}, and overset{⇀}{a}+2 overset{⇀}{b} is perpendicular to 2 overset{⇀}{a}cdot overset{⇀}{b}, find the angle theta between overset{⇀}{a} and overset{⇀}{b}.","solution":"(1) Let overset{⇀}{c} =(x,y).Since overset{⇀}{c} perp overset{⇀}{a}, we have overset{⇀}{c} cdot overset{⇀}{a} = 0.

Probability of drawing a white ball from the second box (P(A_{2})):   - A white ball can be drawn from the second box either after drawing a white ball from the first box or after drawing a black ball from the first box.   - Therefore, P(A_{2}) = P(A_{1})P(A_{2}|A_{1}) + P(overline{A_{1}})P(A_{2}|overline{A_{1}}).   - Substituting the values, we get P(A_{2}) = frac{2}{3} times frac{2}{3} + frac{1}{3} times frac{1}{3} = frac{4}{9} + frac{1}{9} = frac{5}{9}.3. General formula for the probability of drawing a white ball from the nth box (P(A_{n})):   - We observe that P(A_{n}) = frac{1}{3}P(A_{n-1}) + frac{1}{3}.   - Subtracting frac{1}{2} from both sides, we get P(A_{n}) - frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{3}[P(A_{n-1}) - frac{1}{2}].   - This shows that {P(A_{n}) - frac{1}{2}} forms a geometric sequence with the first term frac{1}{6} (since P(A_{1}) - frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{6}) and a common ratio of frac{1}{3}.4.

If (f(x)+1) can be factored by (x-1)^{3}, then its derivative, f^{prime}(x), is divisible by (x-1)^{2}. If (f(x)-1) can be factored by (x+1)^{3}, then the derivative of (f(x)-1), f^{prime}(x), can also be factored by (x+1)^{2}. Thus, we get that f^{prime}(x) can be factored by(x-1)^{2}(x+1)^{2}=left(x^{2}-1right)^{2}=x^{4}-2 x^{2}+1Since f(x) is a fifth-degree polynomial, f^{prime}(x) is a fourth-degree polynomial. Therefore,f^{prime}(x)=Aleft(x^{4}-2 x^{2}+1right)Consequently,f(x)=frac{A x^{5}}{5}-frac{2 A x^{3}}{3}+A x+CTo determine A and C, we need to consider that f(x)+1 is divisible by (x-1)^{3}, so f(1)+1=0, i.e., f(1)=-1.-1=f(1)=frac{A}{5}-frac{2 A}{3}+A+COn the other hand, f(x)-1 is divisible by (x+1)^{3}, so f(-1)-1=0, i.e., f(-1)=1.1=f(-1)=-frac{A}{5}+frac{2 A}{3}-A+CAdding (5) and (6) gives 0=2 C, so C=0. Subtracting (5) from (6) gives -frac{16}{15} A=2, so A=frac{-15}{8}. Therefore,f(x)=-frac{3}{8} x^{5}+frac{5}{4} x^{3}-frac{15}{8} xThis polynomial (and only this one) satisfies the conditions.III. solution. If f(x)-1 can be factored by (x+1)^{3}, then f(-x)-1 can be factored by (-x+1)^{3}, i.e., -(x-1)^{3}. Thus, (x-1)^{3} can be factored from f(x)+1 and f(-x)-1, and therefore from their sum, f(x)+f(-x). Similarly, we get that (x+1)^{3} can also be factored from f(x)+f(-x).The polynomial f(x)+f(-x) is also (at most) a fifth-degree polynomial, and (x+1)^{3} and (x-1)^{3} can be factored from it, so (x+1)^{3}(x-1)^{3} can also be factored from it (since the polynomials (x+1)^{3} and (x-1)^{3} have no common polynomial divisor). A sixth-degree polynomial can only be factored from a (at most) fifth-degree polynomial if the polynomial is identically zero. Therefore,f(x)+f(-x) equiv 0, quad text { i.e., } quad f(x) equiv-f(-x)i.e., f(x) is an odd function.Let f(x)=a_{5} x^{5}+a_{4} x^{4}+a_{3} x^{3}+a_{2} x^{2}+a_{1} x+a_{0}. According to (7), f(0)=-f(0), so a_{0}=f(0)=0. The function a_{5} x^{5} a_{3} x^{3}+a_{1} x is odd, and the difference of odd functions is also odd, so the functiong(x)=a_{4} x^{4}+a_{2} x^{2}=f(x)-a_{5} x^{5}-a_{3} x^{3}-a_{1} xis odd. On the other hand, g(x) is clearly even, so g(-x) equiv g(x) equiv-g(-x), and thus g(x) equiv 0. Therefore, g(x) is identically zero, and thus a_{4}=a_{2}=0, so f(x) equiv a_{5} x^{5}+a_{3} x^{3}+a_{1} x.(f(x)+1) can be factored by (x-1)^{3}, so its derivative, f^{prime}(x), can be factored by (x-1)^{2}, and f^{prime prime}(x) can be factored by (x-1). Therefore, f(1)+1= f^{prime}(1)=f^{prime prime}(1)=0. Substituting these into thebegin{aligned}& 0=f(1)=a_{5}+a_{3}+a_{1}+1 & 0=f^{prime}(1)=5 a_{5}+3 a_{3}+a_{1} & 0=f^{prime prime}(1)=20 a_{5}+6 a_{3}end{aligned}system of equations, we get that the solution to this system of equations is a_{5}=-frac{3}{8}, a_{3}=frac{5}{4}, a_{1}=-frac{15}{8}.

Determine the positions of Tim and Alex at a given time ( t ):   - Tim's position at time ( t ) is ((t, sin t)).   - Alex starts 5 minutes later, so at time ( t ), Alex has been walking for ( t - 5 ) minutes. Therefore, Alex's position at time ( t ) is ((t - 5, cos (t - 5))).2. Calculate the distance between Tim and Alex:   - The distance ( D ) between the points ((t, sin t)) and ((t - 5, cos (t - 5))) is given by the Euclidean distance formula:     [     D = sqrt{(t - (t - 5))^2 + (sin t - cos (t - 5))^2}     ]   - Simplify the expression:     [     D = sqrt{5^2 + (sin t - cos (t - 5))^2}     ]     [     D = sqrt{25 + (sin t - cos (t - 5))^2}     ]3. Maximize the expression ((sin t - cos (t - 5))^2):   - Let ( f(t) = (sin t - cos (t - 5))^2 ).   - To find the maximum value of ( f(t) ), we first need to find the maximum value of (sin t - cos (t - 5)).4. Analyze the function (sin t - cos (t - 5)):   - The trigonometric identity for the sum of angles can be used to simplify (cos (t - 5)):     [     cos (t - 5) = cos t cos 5 + sin t sin 5     ]   - Therefore,     [     sin t - cos (t - 5) = sin t - (cos t cos 5 + sin t sin 5)     ]     [     = sin t - cos t cos 5 - sin t sin 5     ]     [     = sin t (1 - sin 5) - cos t cos 5     ]5. Maximize the expression:   - To maximize ((sin t - cos (t - 5))^2), we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative and setting it to zero. However, this approach is complex due to the trigonometric terms.   - Instead, we can use the fact that the maximum value of (sin t) and (cos t) is 1 and the minimum value is -1. Therefore, the maximum value of (sin t - cos (t - 5)) occurs when (sin t = 1) and (cos (t - 5) = -1) or vice versa.6. Evaluate the maximum distance:   - The maximum value of (sin t - cos (t - 5)) is (sqrt{2}) when (sin t = 1) and (cos (t - 5) = -1).   - Therefore, the maximum value of ((sin t - cos (t - 5))^2) is (2).7.

Thus,   [   f(x) = -cos(2x+frac{3π}{4}) = sin(frac{pi}{2} - (2x + frac{3π}{4})) = sin(2x + frac{pi}{4}).   ]2. Center of Symmetry:   To find the center of symmetry, we set x = -frac{π}{8},   [   f(-frac{π}{8}) = sin(2(-frac{π}{8}) + frac{pi}{4}) = sin(0) = 0.   ]   Therefore, the center of symmetry at (-frac{π}{8}, 0) confirms that statement A is correct.3.

Understanding the problem: We are given ( n ) complex numbers ( z_1, z_2, ldots, z_n ) such that the minimum distance between any two distinct points is at least as large as the maximum distance from any point to the origin. We need to find the maximum possible value of ( n ) and characterize the configurations that achieve this maximum.2. Analyzing the condition: The condition ( min_{j neq k} |z_j - z_k| geq max_{1 leq j leq n} |z_j| ) implies that the distance between any two distinct points is at least as large as the distance from the origin to the farthest point. This suggests that the points are spread out in such a way that they cannot be too close to each other.3. Geometric interpretation: Consider the lines passing through the origin and each point ( z_i ). These lines cannot pass through two distinct points ( z_i ) and ( z_j ) because if they did, the distance ( |z_i - z_j| ) would be less than ( max{|z_i|, |z_j|} ), violating the given condition.4. Angle between lines: Let ( p_i ) be the line passing through the origin and ( z_i ). The angle between any two consecutive lines ( p_i ) and ( p_j ) must be at least ( frac{pi}{3} ). If the angle were smaller, we would form a triangle with vertices at the origin, ( z_i ), and ( z_j ), where the longest side (which is the distance between ( z_i ) and ( z_j )) would be less than or equal to the maximum distance from the origin to any point, contradicting the given condition.5. Maximum number of points: Since the angle between any two consecutive lines is at least ( frac{pi}{3} ), we can fit at most ( leftlfloor frac{2pi}{frac{pi}{3}} rightrfloor = 6 ) such lines around the origin. This means we can have at most 6 points ( z_1, z_2, ldots, z_6 ) such that the condition is satisfied.6. Configuration of points: If there are 6 points, they must form a regular hexagon centered at the origin. This is because the angles between consecutive lines are exactly ( frac{pi}{3} ), and the distances between consecutive points are equal, satisfying the condition ( |z_{k-1} - z_k| geq |z_k| ).7. Including the origin: Adding the origin as a point, we obtain 7 points in total: the 6 vertices of the regular hexagon and the origin itself.8.

The question is: if there are several people staying in the store, and if each room accommodates 7 people, then 7 people will be left without a room. If each room accommodates 9 people, then one room will be empty. Let the total number of rooms in the store be x.

This situation means that all the guests could fit into x-1 rooms if each room accommodated 9 guests.

We need to prove that the sum mid a_1 - b_1 mid + mid a_2 - b_2 mid + ldots + mid a_n - b_n mid does not depend on the specific coloring and compute its value.2. Pairing and ordering:   Since a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n are in increasing order and b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n are in decreasing order, each pair (a_i, b_i) will consist of one number from the set {1, 2, ldots, n} and one number from the set {n+1, n+2, ldots, 2n}.3. Sum of absolute differences:   Consider the sum of absolute differences:   [   sum_{i=1}^n mid a_i - b_i mid   ]   Since a_i le n and b_i ge n+1 (or vice versa), we can write:   [   mid a_i - b_i mid = b_i - a_i   ]   because b_i > a_i for all i.4. Sum of the differences:   We need to compute:   [   sum_{i=1}^n (b_i - a_i)   ]   Since a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n are the numbers 1, 2, ldots, n in some order, and b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n are the numbers n+1, n+2, ldots, 2n in some order, we have:   [   sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 1 + 2 + ldots + n = frac{n(n+1)}{2}   ]   and   [   sum_{i=1}^n b_i = (n+1) + (n+2) + ldots + 2n = frac{n(3n+1)}{2}   ]5.

Understanding the function ( d(n) ):   - The function ( d(n) ) represents the number of positive divisors of ( n ).   - For example, ( d(6) = 4 ) because the divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.2. Initial observations:   - If ( n ) is a prime number ( p ), then ( d(p) = 2 ) because the only divisors are 1 and ( p ).   - If ( n ) is a power of a prime, say ( n = p^k ), then ( d(p^k) = k + 1 ).3. Key insight:   - We need to find ( n ) such that no matter how many times we apply ( d ), we never get a perfect square.   - A perfect square is an integer that can be expressed as ( m^2 ) for some integer ( m ).4. Inductive step:   - Suppose for ( n = 1, 2, ldots, m-1 ), we can find a ( k ) such that (underbrace{d(dots d(d}_{k text{times}} (n) dots )) is a perfect square.   - We need to prove this for ( n = m ).5. Case analysis:   - If ( d(m) ) can be represented as ( p^{q-1} ) where ( p ) and ( q ) are prime numbers, then we need to check if ( d(m) ) can be a perfect square.   - If ( q > 2 ), then ( q-1 ) is even, and ( p^{q-1} ) is a perfect square.   - If ( q = 2 ), then ( d(m) = p ), and we need to check if ( m ) can be written as ( r_1^{p-1} ) where ( r_1 ) and ( p ) are primes.6. Conclusion:   - If ( n ) can be represented as ( p^{q-1} ) where ( p ) and ( q ) are prime numbers, then ( d(n) = q ), ( d(q) = 2 ), and ( d(2) = 2 ), which is not a perfect square.   - Therefore, for such ( n ), we cannot find a ( k ) such that (underbrace{d(dots d(d}_{k text{times}} (n) dots )) is a perfect square.The final answer is ( boxed{ n } ) can be represented as ( p^{q-1} ) where ( p ) and ( q ) are prime numbers."},{"problem":"A rectangular prism has a volume of 8 mathrm{~cm}^{3}.

Thus we havea_{1}=a_{3}=a_{5}=max left{a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}, a_{5}, a_{6}right}Let us consider the other relations. Usinga_{2}^{2}-a_{2} a_{3}+a_{3}^{2}=a_{3}^{2}-a_{3} a_{4}+a_{4}^{2}we get a_{2}=a_{4} or a_{2}+a_{4}=a_{3}=a_{1}. Similarly, two more relations give either a_{4}=a_{6} or a_{4}+a_{6}=a_{5}=a_{1}; and either a_{6}=a_{2} or a_{6}+a_{2}=a_{1}. Let us give values to a_{1} and count the number of six-tuples in each case.(A) Suppose a_{1}=1. In this case all a_{j} 's are equal and we get only one six-tuple (1,1,1,1,1,1).(B) If a_{1}=2, we have a_{3}=a_{5}=2. We observe that a_{2}=a_{4}=a_{6}=1 or a_{2}=a_{4}= a_{6}=2. We get two more six-tuples: (2,1,2,1,2,1),(2,2,2,2,2,2).(C) Taking a_{1}=3, we see that a_{3}=a_{5}=3. In this case we get nine possibilities for left(a_{2}, a_{4}, a_{6}right)(1,1,1),(2,2,2),(3,3,3),(1,1,2),(1,2,1),(2,1,1),(1,2,2),(2,1,2),(2,2,1)(D) In the case a_{1}=4, we have a_{3}=a_{5}=4 andbegin{aligned}left(a_{2}, a_{4}, a_{6}right)=(2,2,2),(4,4,4) & ,(1,1,1),(3,3,3) & (1,1,3),(1,3,1),(3,1,1),(1,3,3),(3,1,3),(3,3,1)end{aligned}Thus we get 1+2+9+10=22 solutions. Since left(a_{1}, a_{3}, a_{5}right) and left(a_{2}, a_{4}, a_{6}right) may be interchanged, we get 22 more six-tuples. However there are 4 common among these, namely, (1,1,1,1,1,1),(2,2,2,2,2,2),(3,3,3,3,3,3) and (4,4,4,4,4,4).

As well, triangle R O Q is equilateral so angle R Q O=60^{circ}.Points X, Q, and B are on a line, so angle X Q O=180^{circ}-60^{circ}-45^{circ}=75^{circ}.By very similar reasoning, angle X P O=75^{circ}, which means triangle O P Q is isosceles with O P=O Q.Since angle O Q X=75^{circ}, we have sin 75^{circ}=frac{O X}{O Q}=frac{O X}{r} and so O X=r sin 75^{circ}.Similarly, Q X=r cos 75^{circ}, and since triangle O P Q is isosceles, O X bisects P Q, which means P Q=2 r cos 75^{circ}.From the double-angle formula, sin 150^{circ}=2 sin 75^{circ} cos 75^{circ}.

As well, triangle R O Q is equilateral, which means angle R O Q=60^{circ}. Using that P, Q, and B lie on the same line, we can compute angle P Q O=180^{circ}-60^{circ}-45^{circ}=75^{circ}.By similar reasoning, angle Q P O=75^{circ}, which implies that triangle P Q O is isosceles with O P=O Q=r.

Since (ABCDE) is a convex pentagon with equal side lengths, we can infer that (AB = BC = CD = DE = EA).3. Given that (angle A = angle B = 90^circ), we can visualize the pentagon as having a square (ABCE) with an additional triangle (CDE) attached to it.4. The quadrilateral (ABCE) is a square because it has four equal sides and all angles are (90^circ). Therefore, (angle AEC = 90^circ).5. The remaining part of the pentagon is the triangle (CDE). Since (CD = DE = EA), triangle (CDE) is equilateral, meaning all its internal angles are (60^circ).6. To find (angle E), we need to consider the angles at point (E).

Initial Observation:   We start by testing ( t = 0 ). Substituting ( t = 0 ) into the equation, we get:   [   (sin 0 + i cos 0)^n = sin(0) + i cos(0)   ]   Simplifying, we have:   [   (0 + i cdot 1)^n = 0 + i cdot 1 implies i^n = i   ]   This implies:   [   i^n = i   ]   Since ( i^1 = i ), we need ( n equiv 1 pmod{4} ).2. Verification:   To verify, we factor out ( i ) from the right-hand side (RHS) of the original equation:   [   sin(nt) + i cos(nt) = i(cos(nt) - i sin(nt)) = i text{cis}(-nt)   ]   Similarly, for the left-hand side (LHS):   [   (sin t + i cos t)^n = (i cos t + sin t)^n = (i text{cis}(-t))^n = i^n text{cis}(-nt)   ]   For the equality to hold, we need:   [   i^n text{cis}(-nt) = i text{cis}(-nt)   ]   This implies:   [   i^n = i   ]   Therefore, ( n equiv 1 pmod{4} ).3. Counting Solutions:   We need to count the number of positive integers ( n ) less than or equal to ( 1000 ) that satisfy ( n equiv 1 pmod{4} ). These numbers form an arithmetic sequence:   [   1, 5, 9, ldots, 997   ]   The general term of this sequence is given by:   [   a_k = 1 + (k-1) cdot 4 = 4k - 3   ]   Setting ( a_k leq 1000 ):   [   4k - 3 leq 1000 implies 4k leq 1003 implies k leq frac{1003}{4} implies k leq 250.75   ]   Since ( k ) must be an integer, the largest possible value for ( k ) is ( 250 ).Thus, there are ( 250 ) positive integers ( n ) less than or equal to ( 1000 ) that satisfy the given condition.The final answer is (boxed{250})"},{"problem":"6.

Since the angle at vertex A is common to both triangles, there are two options: either angle A B Q=angle A D P, angle A Q B=angle A P D, or angle A B Q=angle A P D, angle A Q B=angle A D P. The second case is impossible, as angle A D P is the external angle of triangle C D Q, so it equals the sum of angle D C Q+angle D Q C, i.e., angle A D P>angle A Q B. Therefore, only the first case remains, and angle A B C=angle A D C. Since quadrilateral A B C D is inscribed in a circle, angle A B C+angle A D C=180^{circ}, from which angle A B C=angle A D C=90^{circ}. Consequently, A C is the diameter of the circle, A C=14.b) Let the circle inscribed in triangle A B C touch its sides A B and B C at points M and N, respectively, and the circle inscribed in triangle A C D touch its sides A D and C D at points L and G, respectively. Note that under the additional condition A T=T C. By the property of tangent segments to a circle, A L=A T=T C=C G, D G=D L. Therefore, triangle A C D is isosceles, and since angle D=90^{circ}, angle D A C=45^{circ}. The area of triangle A C D is 0.5 A C cdot D T=49.Now apply the property of tangents to triangle A B C: C N=C K=5, A M=A K=9; let B N=B M=x.

A distribution of stickers among the 33 friends is incomplete when there is a sticker that no friend has. Determine the least m with the following property: every distribution of stickers among the 33 friends such that, for any two friends, there are at least m stickers both don't have, is incomplete.","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to determine the smallest number ( m ) such that in any distribution of 2011 stickers among 33 friends, if for any two friends there are at least ( m ) stickers that neither of them has, then the distribution is incomplete (i.e., there is at least one sticker that no friend has).2. Rephrasing the Condition:   If for any two friends, there are at least ( m ) stickers that neither of them has, then for any pair of friends, they can collectively have at most ( 2011 - m ) stickers.3. Proving ( m = 1890 ) Satisfies the Condition:   - If ( m = 1890 ), then for any two friends, there are at least 1890 stickers that neither of them has.   - This implies that for any two friends, they can collectively have at most ( 2011 - 1890 = 121 ) stickers.   - If each friend has at most 60 stickers, then the total number of different stickers among all friends is at most ( 33 times 60 = 1980 ), which is less than 2011, making the distribution incomplete.   - If one friend has more than 60 stickers, say ( n ) stickers where ( n > 60 ), then the remaining 32 friends can have at most ( 121 - n ) stickers each. The total number of different stickers is then at most ( 32 times (121 - n) + n = 3872 - 31n ). Since ( n > 60 ), we have ( 3872 - 31n < 1981 ), making the distribution incomplete.   - Therefore, ( m = 1890 ) ensures that the distribution is always incomplete.4. Proving ( m = 1889 ) Does Not Satisfy the Condition:   - If ( m = 1889 ), then for any two friends, there are at least 1889 stickers that neither of them has.   - This implies that for any two friends, they can collectively have at most ( 2011 - 1889 = 122 ) stickers.   - Consider a counterexample where 31 friends each have 61 different stickers, and the remaining 2 friends each have 60 different stickers. This distribution satisfies the condition that any two friends have at most 122 stickers collectively.   - However, the total number of different stickers is ( 31 times 61 + 2 times 60 = 1891 + 120 = 2011 ), which means the distribution is complete.   - Therefore, ( m = 1889 ) does not ensure that the distribution is always incomplete.5. Conclusion:   Since ( m = 1890 ) satisfies the condition and ( m = 1889 ) does not, the least ( m ) with the desired property is 1890.The final answer is ( boxed{1890} )"},{"problem":"The projection of two skew lines onto a plane must be (　　)A: Two intersecting linesB: Two parallel linesC: A line and a point outside the lineD: All of the above are possible","solution":"If the given plane is perpendicular to one of the two skew lines, then the projection of the two skew lines onto the plane is a line and a point outside the line;  If the given plane is not perpendicular to both skew lines but is parallel to the common perpendicular of the skew lines, then the projection of the two skew lines onto the plane is two parallel lines;  If the given plane is not perpendicular to both skew lines and is not parallel to the common perpendicular of the skew lines, then the projection of the two skew lines onto the plane is two intersecting lines;  Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{D}.

Define the function and its iterations:   Given ( f^1(x) = x^3 - 3x ), we define ( f^n(x) = f(f^{n-1}(x)) ). We need to find the roots of ( frac{f^{2022}(x)}{x} ).2. Identify the roots of ( f(x) ):   The roots of ( f(x) = x^3 - 3x ) are ( x = 0, pm sqrt{3} ). These roots will be the same for ( f^n(x) ) due to the recursive nature of the function.3.

Properties of ( f^n(x) ):   Since ( f^n(x) ) is an odd function, ( frac{f^n(x)}{x} ) is even. This implies ( a_1 = 0 ).

Inductive proof for coefficients:   We claim ( a_3(n) = (-3)^{n-1} cdot frac{9^n - 1}{8} ) and ( a_1(n) = (-3)^n ). We prove this by induction:   - Base case: For ( n = 1 ), ( f^1(x) = x^3 - 3x ), so ( a_3(1) = 1 ) and ( a_1(1) = -3 ).   - Inductive step: Assume the assertion holds for ( n = k ). Consider ( f^{k+1}(x) = f(f^k(x)) ):     [     f^{k+1}(x) = (a_3(k)x^3 + a_1(k)x)^3 - 3(a_3(k)x^3 + a_1(k)x)     ]     Simplifying, we get:     [     a_3(k+1) = (-3)^{3k} + (-3)^k cdot frac{9^k - 1}{8} = (-3)^k cdot frac{9^{k+1} - 1}{8}     ]     [     a_1(k+1) = (-3)^{k+1}     ]6.

Odd Function Property: For y=f(2x-1) to be an odd function, we must have f(2x-1) + f(-2x-1) = 0. This property implies that the graph of f(x) is symmetric about the point (-1,0).2. Even Function Property: For y=f(x+1) to be an even function, we must have f(x+1) = f(-x+1). This property implies that the graph of f(x) is symmetric about the line x=1.3. Combining Symmetries: From the above symmetries, we can deduce that f(x) = f(-x+2) = -f(x-4). This leads to the conclusion that f(x+8) = -f(x+4) = f(x). This shows that f(x) is a periodic function with a period of 8.4. Calculating f(194): Given the periodicity, we can find f(194) by reducing 194 modulo the period of 8. This gives us f(194) = f(8times24 + 2) = f(2). Since the function is periodic with a period of 8, and knowing that f(x) = e^x for x in (-1,1), we can further deduce that f(2) = f(0) because 2 is within the period shift from 0.5.

Find the remainder when[sum_{n=1}^{2017} d_n]is divided by 1000.","solution":"1. First, we need to find the units digit of the sum of the first ( n ) positive integers, ( 1 + 2 + dots + n ). The sum of the first ( n ) positive integers is given by the formula:   [   S_n = frac{n(n+1)}{2}   ]   We are interested in the units digit of ( S_n ), denoted as ( d_n ).2. To find the pattern in the units digits, we compute ( d_n ) for ( n ) from 1 to 20:   [   begin{aligned}   &d_1 = 1,    &d_2 = 3,    &d_3 = 6,    &d_4 = 0,    &d_5 = 5,    &d_6 = 1,    &d_7 = 8,    &d_8 = 6,    &d_9 = 5,    &d_{10} = 5,    &d_{11} = 6,    &d_{12} = 8,    &d_{13} = 1,    &d_{14} = 5,    &d_{15} = 0,    &d_{16} = 6,    &d_{17} = 3,    &d_{18} = 1,    &d_{19} = 0,    &d_{20} = 0.   end{aligned}   ]3. We observe that the units digits repeat every 20 numbers. Therefore, the sequence ( d_n ) is periodic with a period of 20.4. To find the sum of ( d_n ) from ( n = 1 ) to ( n = 2017 ), we first calculate the sum of one full period (20 terms):   [   sum_{n=1}^{20} d_n = 1 + 3 + 6 + 0 + 5 + 1 + 8 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 1 + 5 + 0 + 6 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 70   ]5. Since ( 2017 = 100 times 20 + 17 ), there are 100 full periods and an additional 17 terms. Therefore, we calculate:   [   sum_{n=1}^{2017} d_n = 100 times sum_{n=1}^{20} d_n + sum_{n=1}^{17} d_n   ]6. We already know ( sum_{n=1}^{20} d_n = 70 ).

Combining these results, we get:   [   sum_{n=1}^{2017} d_n = 100 times 70 + 69 = 7000 + 69 = 7069   ]8.

Condition for H_1H_2 parallel MN:   - For H_1H_2 to be parallel to MN, MN must be perpendicular to XY.   - This implies that MXNY must be a rhombus, as a rhombus has all sides equal and its diagonals are perpendicular.6. Equality of Diagonals:   - For MXNY to be a rhombus, the lengths of MX and MY must be equal:     [     frac{1}{2}AC = frac{1}{2}BD implies AC = BD     ]Therefore, H_1H_2 is parallel to MN if and only if AC = BD.[boxed{AC = BD}]"},{"problem":"SUBIECTUL III Let I, J be intervals and f: I rightarrow mathbf{R}^{*} a function with a primitive F: I rightarrow mathbf{R} that is bijective.a) Calculate int frac{F^{-1}(x)}{fleft(F^{-1}(x)right)} d x, x in J.b) Calculate int frac{ln left(x+sqrt{x^{2}+1}right)}{sqrt{x^{2}+1}} d x, x in mathbf{R}.","solution":"## Solution:a) From F bijective Rightarrow Fleft(F^{-1}(x)right)=x, forall x in J.By differentiation we obtainF^{prime}left(F^{-1}(x)right) cdotleft(F^{-1}right)^{prime}(x)=1, forall x in J Leftrightarrowleft(F^{-1}right)^{prime}(x)=frac{1}{fleft(F^{-1}(x)right)}, x in Jand thusleft(frac{1}{2}left(F^{-1}(x)right)^{2}right)^{prime}=F^{-1}(x) cdotleft(F^{-1}(x)right)^{prime}=F^{-1}(x) frac{1}{fleft(F^{-1}(x)right)}, x in J,therefore: int frac{F^{-1}(x)}{fleft(F^{-1}(x)right)} d x=frac{1}{2}left(F^{-1}(x)right)^{2}+C, x in J.## www.edums.ro## b) Method I:int frac{ln left(x+sqrt{x^{2}+1}right)}{sqrt{x^{2}+1}} d x=intleft(ln left(x+sqrt{x^{2}+1}right)right)^{prime} cdot ln left(x+sqrt{x^{2}+1}right) d x=frac{1}{2} ln ^{2}left(x+sqrt{x^{2}+1}right)+CMethod II: Let f(x)=frac{e^{x}+e^{-x}}{2}, x in mathbf{R} and F: mathbf{R} rightarrow mathbf{R}, F(x)=frac{e^{x}-e^{-x}}{2}.

It is reflected from the sides, but absorbed by the four corners. It starts from an arbitrary point P inside the square. Let c(k) be the number of possible starting directions from which it reaches a corner after traveling a distance k or less. Find the smallest constant a 2 , such that from some constants a 1 and a 0 , c(k) ≤ a 2 k 2 + a 1 k + a 0 for all P and all k. Solution","solution":": π. By a series of reflections we can transform the path into a straight line. The particle reaches a corner iff the transformed line passes through a lattice point. So the number of directions which lead to absorption in a distance k or less is the number of lattice points in a circle radius k. At least that would be true except for the shadowing problem - the starting point may lie on a line of lattice points in which case it could never reach the ones further out. Shadowing reduces the number of lattice points in the circle that we should count, so the number of lattice points is still an upper bound. Evidently what we need are some estimates for the number of lattice points in the circle. They do not need to be good estimates - we only need the highest power to be correct. We can regard each lattice point as the centre of a unit square. The resulting unit squares tile the plane. The circle radius k has area πk 2 , so it contains around πk 2 of the unit squares and hence around πk 2 lattice points. However, the squares around the edge may be incomplete and the incomplete squares may or may not include their centres. The maximum distance between two points of a unit square is √2, so the circle radius k + √2 contains the entirety of any square which overlaps the circle radius k. Hence the number of lattice points in the circle radius k is at most π(k + √2) 2 . Thus if we take a 2 = π, a 1 = 2π√2, a 0 = 2π, then c(k) ≤ a 2 k 2 + a 1 k + a 0 for all P and k. Similarly, any unit square overlapping the circle radius k - √2 is entirely contained in the circle radius k. There are at least π(k - √2) 2 such squares, so the circle radius k contains at least π(k - √2) 2 lattice points. Take a coordinate system with axes parallel to the sides of the squares. Then all lines joining lattice points have rational slope, so if we take the point P to have one coordinate rational and the other irrational, it cannot lie on any such lines. Thus for these points there is no shadowing problem and the number of directions is at least π(k - √2) 2 . This shows that π is the minimal value of a 2 (because for any smaller value and any a 1 , a 0 we would have a 2 k 2 + a 1 k + a 0 < π(k - √2) 2 for sufficiently large k). 42nd Putnam 1981 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 16 Jan 2001"},{"problem":"## Task 4 - 240614Rita multiplies a number z by 9 and gets the result 111111111.(a) Which number z is it?(b) Determine a number x that has the following property!If you multiply x by the number z determined in (a), then the product is a number written entirely with the digit 8 (in the usual decimal notation).(c) Are there any other numbers besides the number x determined in (b) that also have this property?If this is the case, determine another such number!","solution":"(a) Since 111111111: 9=12345679, z=12345679 is the number that, when multiplied by 9, gives 111111111.(b) From 12345679 cdot 9=111111111 it follows that 12345679 cdot 72=888888888 (1)Therefore, for example, the number x=72 has the required property that the number z cdot x is written entirely with the digit 8.(c) From (1) it follows that 12345679 cdot 72 cdot 1000000001=888888888 cdot 1000000001, (2)i.e., 12345679 cdot 72000000072=888888888888888888.

From any node in the figure, we can reach any other node by traversing at most 5 path segments, specifically 3 circular path segments and 2 ray path segments. Therefore, for example, from the node labeled 1 to the node labeled 17, on the shortest path, the increase of 17 - 1 = 16 units must include at least one path segment with an increase greater than 3, even if we end up at a larger number with each of the 5 path segments, since 16 > 5 * 3.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_755a373737e285d97c6bg-1.jpg?height=462&width=1182&top_left_y=789&top_left_x=450)Figure 2b) Figure 2 shows three arrangements where the smallest difference (in absolute value) is 6. This was achieved in the I. and II. arrangements by dividing the numbers into \\"small\\" ones: 1, 2, ..., 9, and \\"large\\" ones: 10, 11, ..., 18, and writing large numbers next to small ones and vice versa. The III. arrangement achieved the goal without this additional requirement. In the I. and III. arrangements, however, the numbers on the outer and inner circular paths that are 5 path segments apart (i.e., the farthest apart) from each other, and also the numbers on the opposite points of the middle circular path, add up to 19. Both of these additional self-imposed requirements facilitated and accelerated the arrangement.Gönczi István (Miskolc, Földes F. Gymnasium II. grade) Greskovics Klára (Budapest, Eötvös J. Gymnasium I. grade)Remarks. 1. The statement can also be proven by the following local (pertaining to only a small part of the figure) consideration. Consider the neighbors of the number 1. If the number 1 is at one of the nodes of the middle circular path, it has 4 neighbors, so a difference of 4 already occurs if we choose the closest 2, 3, 4, and 5 for its neighbors. If the number 1 has only 3 neighbors, choosing 2, 3, and 4 for them—and only then—there is no difference greater than 3. Thus, the number 2 is not a neighbor of 3 and 4, and it must have two additional neighbors. If these are the smallest possible: 5 and 6, a difference of 6 - 2 = 4 still occurs.Similarly, it can be shown that the smallest difference cannot be 8: Otherwise, the neighbors of 9 could only be 1, 17, and 18, and the neighbors of 10 could only be 1, 2, and 18, so neither 9 nor 10 would be on the middle circular path, and yet they would have two common neighbors: 1 and 18.

It can sell 100 pounds per day. Through investigation, it was found that for this kind of grapes, for every decrease of 0.1 yuan per pound in the selling price, an additional 20 pounds can be sold per day.  (1) If the selling price per pound of grapes is reduced by x yuan, then the daily sales volume is ______ pounds (expressed as an algebraic expression containing x);  (2) In order for the supermarket to make a profit of 300 yuan per day from selling these grapes, and to ensure that at least 220 pounds are sold per day, how much should the selling price per pound be reduced by?","solution":" Step-by-Step Solution:# Part (1): Finding the Daily Sales Volume as an Algebraic ExpressionGiven that the initial sales volume is 100 pounds per day and for every 0.1 yuan decrease in the selling price, an additional 20 pounds can be sold. If the selling price is reduced by x yuan, then the increase in sales volume can be calculated as follows:- The decrease in price per pound is x yuan.- For every 0.1 yuan decrease, sales increase by 20 pounds.Thus, the increase in sales volume due to the price reduction is frac{x}{0.1} times 20 = 200x pounds.Adding this to the initial sales volume gives the total daily sales volume as:100 + 200x text{ pounds}Therefore, the daily sales volume as an algebraic expression containing x is:boxed{100 + 200x text{ pounds}}# Part (2): Determining the Reduction in Selling Price for a 300 Yuan ProfitTo achieve a 300 yuan profit per day while ensuring at least 220 pounds are sold, we use the given profit formula and the requirement for minimum sales volume. The profit per day is calculated by the difference in selling and purchasing price per pound, multiplied by the daily sales volume. The equation is set up as follows:- The profit per pound is (5 - 3 - x) yuan, where 5 is the selling price, 3 is the purchasing price, and x is the reduction in selling price.- The daily sales volume is (100 + 200x) pounds.The profit equation is:(5 - 3 - x)(100 + 200x) = 300Simplifying this equation gives:2x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0Solving this quadratic equation, we find two possible values for x:x_1 = frac{1}{2}, quad x_2 = 1To determine which value of x meets the requirement of selling at least 220 pounds per day, we check both solutions:- For x = frac{1}{2}, the daily sales volume is 100 + 200 times frac{1}{2} = 200 pounds, which is less than 220 pounds and does not meet the requirement.- For x = 1, the daily sales volume is 100 + 200 times 1 = 300 pounds, which exceeds 220 pounds and meets the requirement.Therefore, the selling price per pound must be reduced by:boxed{x = 1 text{ yuan}}# Analysis and Comments:This problem demonstrates the application of algebraic expressions and quadratic equations to solve real-world problems. By expressing the daily sales volume in terms of the price reduction x and setting up an equation for the desired profit, we can solve for x and determine the necessary reduction in selling price.

They make the following observations:triangleright The difference in the number of nuggets between two neighboring dwarves is always 2 or 3.triangleright All the dwarves have mined a different number of nuggets.What is the greatest possible difference in nuggets between the dwarf who found the most and the one who found the least?","solution":"## Solution to Exercise 4Answer: The greatest possible difference is 29.In this exercise, we aim to demonstrate that 29 is the greatest possible difference. The solution necessarily consists of two parts. First, we show that if ( n ) is the difference between the largest and smallest number of nuggets collected, then ( n leq 29 ); this step is called the analysis. Second, we show that there exists a configuration of 20 dwarfs that satisfies the conditions of the problem and where the difference between the largest and smallest number of nuggets collected is exactly 29; this step is called the construction or synthesis.## Analysis:Consider a configuration of 20 dwarfs arranged in a circle and satisfying the properties of the problem. Since the difference in nuggets between two neighboring dwarfs is at most 3, we deduce that if two dwarfs ( A ) and ( B ) are separated by ( k-1 ) dwarfs, the difference in their number of nuggets is at most ( 3k ), with equality only if the difference in nuggets between each pair of neighbors between ( A ) and ( B ) is exactly 3.Given any two dwarfs in the circle, they are separated by at most 9 dwarfs. Indeed, if both arcs of the circle connecting the two dwarfs contain at least 10 dwarfs, it means there are 22 dwarfs around the table.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_17def46ea4e6119381e4g-06.jpg?height=588&width=696&top_left_y=1528&top_left_x=680)In particular, between the dwarf ( P ) with the most nuggets and the dwarf ( M ) with the least nuggets, there are at most 9 dwarfs, so the difference between the two numbers is at most ( 3 times 10 = 30 ).However, if there is exactly a 30-nugget difference between the dwarf ( P ) and the dwarf ( M ), it means, on the one hand, that they are diametrically opposite on the table (there are exactly 9 dwarfs on each arc of the circle connecting them), and on the other hand, that on each arc of the circle, the difference in nuggets between two neighboring dwarfs is exactly 3. In particular, the two neighbors of the dwarf with the most nuggets each have 3 more nuggets than ( M ). These two neighbors have the same number of nuggets, which is excluded. Thus, the difference sought is at most 30 and cannot be 30, so it is at most 29.## Construction:Conversely, in the following configuration where each dwarf is represented with their number of nuggets, we verify that the conditions of the problem are satisfied and that the difference between the dwarf with the most nuggets and the dwarf with the least nuggets is exactly 29.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_17def46ea4e6119381e4g-07.jpg?height=605&width=625&top_left_y=340&top_left_x=721)Comment from the graders: The exercise, which is quite difficult, was moderately well done, with many partial solutions and a significant number of misunderstandings of the problem statement. Many students drew the configuration they thought was the best, which is very good.

Given that A B=400 meters, we have A G_{3}=300 meters. The challenge lies in how to find the lengths of A G_{1} and A G_{2}. We will first find A G_{2}, and two methods are provided:Method 1: As shown in the figure, extend G_{2} E to intersect the extension of B C at point H. triangle A D C is intercepted by W_{2} E H, so frac{A W_{2}}{W_{2} D} cdot frac{D H}{H C} cdot frac{C E}{E A}=1 Rightarrow 1 cdot frac{D H}{H C} cdot frac{1}{3}=1 Rightarrow frac{D H}{H C}=3. Let C H=a, then D C=2 a, so B D=D C=2 a. Since triangle A B D is intercepted by G_{2} W_{2} H, we have frac{A G_{2}}{G_{2} B} cdot frac{B H}{H D} cdot frac{D W_{2}}{W_{2} A}=1 Rightarrow frac{A G_{2}}{G_{2} B} cdot frac{5}{3} cdot 1=1 Rightarrow frac{A G_{2}}{G_{2} B}=frac{3}{5} Rightarrow frac{A G_{2}}{A B}=frac{3}{8}. Given that A B=400 meters, we have A G_{2}=150 meters.Method 2: As shown in the figure, draw E I parallel A K parallel B C, then frac{A J}{A D}=frac{A E}{A C}=frac{3}{4}. Let A D=4 k, then A J=3 k. Since W_{2} is the midpoint of A D, we have A W_{2}=2 k, thus frac{A K}{E J}=frac{A W_{2}}{W_{2} J}=2 Rightarrow A K=2 E J. Since frac{E J}{D C}=frac{A J}{A D}=frac{I J}{B D} and D C=B D, we have E J=I J Rightarrow I E=2 E J. Since A K=2 E J, we have A K=I E, so frac{A G_{2}}{G_{2} I}=frac{A K}{I E}=1. Since frac{A I}{A B}=frac{A E}{A C}=frac{3}{4}, and combining A G_{2}=G_{2} I, we get frac{A G_{2}}{A B}=frac{3}{8}. Given that A B=400 meters, we have A G_{2}=150 meters.Using the same method, we can find that A G_{1}=60 meters, thus we have A G_{1}=60, A G_{2}=150, and A G_{3}=300. For the mouse, the distances it travels are as follows:Therefore, it sees the cheese five times."},{"problem":"7.077. 17 cdot 2^{sqrt{x^{2}-8 x}}-8=2 cdot 4^{sqrt{x^{2}-8 x}}.","solution":"Solution.Domain of definition: x^{2}-8 x geq 0, x in(-infty ; 0] cup[8 ;+infty)We have 2 cdot 2^{2 sqrt{x^{2}-8 x}}-17 cdot 2^{sqrt{x^{2}-8 x}}+8=0.

Answer: (m, n)=(1144,377) or (377,1144).Let m and n be positive integers satisfying the given equation. That is 2011(m+ n)=3left(m^{2}-m n+n^{2}right). Since the equation is symmetric in m and n, we may assume m geq n. If m=n, then m=n=4022 / 3 which is not an integer. So we may further assume m>n. Let p=m+n and q=m-n>0. Then m=(p+q) / 2 and n=(p-q) / 2, and the equation becomes 8044 p=3left(p^{2}+3 q^{2}right). Since 3 does not divide 8044 , it must divide p. By letting p=3 r, the above equation reduces to 8044 r=3left(3 r^{2}+q^{2}right). From this, 3 must divide r. By letting r=3 s, we get 8044 s=27 s^{2}+q^{2}, or equivalentlys(8044-27 s)=q^{2} .For s between 1 and lfloor 8044 / 27rfloor=297, the number s(8044-27 s) is a square only when s=169. To narrow down the values of s, we proceed as follow.Let s=2^{alpha} u, where alpha is a nonnegative integer and u is an odd positive integer. Suppose alpha is odd and alpha geq 3. Then (*) becomes 2^{alpha+2} uleft(2011-27 times 2^{alpha-2} uright)=q^{2} which is a square. Since alpha+2 is odd, 2 must divide 2011-27 times 2^{alpha-2} u implying 2 divides 2011 which is a contradiction. Next suppose alpha=1. Then we have u(2 times 2011-27 u)=(q / 2)^{2}. If u is not a square, then there exists an odd prime factor t of u such that t divides 2 times 2011-27 u. Thus t divides 2 times 2011 so that t must be 2011 since 2011 is a prime. But then u geq t=2011 contradicting 2 times 2011-27 u>0. Therefore u must be a square. This implies that 2 times 2011-27 u is also a square. Taking mod 4 , we have u equiv 0 or 1 .(bmod 4) so that 2 times 2011-27 u equiv 2 or 3(bmod 4) which contradicts the fact that 2 times 2011-27 u is a square. Thus alpha neq 1 too. Consequently alpha must be even. Then dividing both sides of (*) by 2^{alpha}, we obtain uleft(8044-27 times 2^{alpha} uright)=q^{2} / 2^{alpha} which is a square. Now suppose u is not a square. Then there exists an odd prime factor v of u such that v divides 8044-27 times 2^{alpha} u. Then v must divide 8044 so that v=2011. Thus u geq v=2011. This again contradicts the fact that 8044-27 times 2^{alpha} u>0. Therefore u is a square. Consequently s is also a square. Write s=w^{2}. Then ( * ) becomes w^{2}left(8044-27 w^{2}right)=q^{2} geq 0. From this w leqleftlfloor(8044 / 27)^{frac{1}{2}}rightrfloor=17. A direct verification shows that 8044-27 w^{2} is a square only when w=13. Thus s=w^{2}=169. Then p=3 r=9 s=1521, and by (*) q=(169 times(8044-27 times 169))^{frac{1}{2}}=767.

The product of the LCM and GCD of any two natural numbers is equal to the product of these numbers. From this fact, the first equation, and Vieta's theorem, it follows that the LCM and GCD of the numbers m and n are the roots of the same quadratic trinomial as m and n themselves, which means they are equal to m and n (in some order). Since m>n (from the second equation), m is the LCM, and n is the GCD. Therefore, m=k n for some natural number k>1.

Therefore if P(P(n)+n) is prime then either P(n)= pm 1 or P(P(n)+n)= pm P(n)=p for some prime number p. Since P(x) is a polynomial, it follows that P(n)= pm 1 for only finitely many integers n. Therefore either P(n)=P(P(n)+n) for infinitely many integers n or P(n)=-P(P(n)+n) for infinitely many integers n. Suppose that P(n)=P(P(n)+n) for infinitely many integers n. This implies that the polynomial P(P(x)+x)-P(x) has infinitely many roots and thus is identically zero. Therefore P(P(x)+ x)=P(x) holds identically. Now note that if k geq 2 then P(P(x)+x) has degree k^{2} while P(x) has degree k, which is not possible. Therefore P(x) is at most linear with P(x)=a x+b for some integers a and b. Now note thatP(P(x)+x)=a(a+1) x+a b+band thus a=a(a+1) and a b+b=b. It follows that a=0 which leads to the solution P(n)=p where p is a prime number. By the same argument if P(n)=-P(P(n)+n) for infinitely many integers n then P(x)=-P(P(x)+x) holds identically and P(x) is linear with P(x)=a x+b. In this case it follows that a=-a(a+1) and a b+b=-b. This implies that either a=0 or a=-2. If a=-2 then P(n)=-2 n+b which is prime for some integers n only if b is odd.

If we add up all the numbers in the considered table row by row, we will conclude that the total sum is equal to the sum of the numbers in the exceptional row where it is not zero. This sum is at most 10, and it equals 10 if all the numbers in the given row are ones. (We reach the same conclusion if we add up all the numbers in the table column by column.)If we now provide an example of a filled 10 times 10 table that meets the conditions and where the sum of all the numbers is indeed 10, we will be done with solving the problem. We know that in such a table, there must be a row and a column filled entirely with ones. We place them in the first column from the left and the last row from the top. Then our task is to fill the remaining 9 times 9 square (in the top right corner of the table) with the numbers 1 and -1 so that in each of its rows and columns, there are exactly 5k times the number -1 (and thus 4 times the number 1).The following images show three of the possible ways to accomplish the described task. For clarity, the numbers are not listed in the 10 times 10 tables. Instead, the cells with the number 1 are white (as is the case, for example, in the entire first column and the entire last row), and the cells with the number -1 are colored.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_29a3dddc7a9db375e695g-09.jpg?height=462&width=1434&top_left_y=1231&top_left_x=310)In the left image, a traditional construction with \\"cyclic shifting\\" of the colored group of cells along the rows of the \\"remaining\\" 9 times 9 table is used.

The largest possible sum of all the numbers in the table is 10.## GUIDING AND ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS:N1. In one row, 71 numbers are written. Each of them is 1 or -1, and the sum of any ten consecutive numbers is 0. Prove that the first number is equal to the last number, and determine the largest possible sum of all the numbers. [The first 70 numbers can be divided into 7 tens with a sum of zero. The sum of all the numbers is therefore equal to the last number. Similarly, we find that the sum of all the numbers is equal to the first number when we consider the division into 7 tens of the last 70 numbers. The first and last numbers are therefore equal, and that is the sum of all the numbers, which is at most 1. The example of 71 numbers 1, -1, 1, ldots, -1, 1 satisfies the condition of the problem and their total sum is 1, which is the sought maximum possible sum.][^0]N2. A 5 times 4 table is filled with the numbers 1 and -1 such that the sum of the numbers in each 2 times 2 square is 0. Determine the largest possible sum of all the numbers in the table. [The largest possible sum is 4. The given 5 times 4 table (with five rows and four columns) can be divided into the top row 1 times 4 and four 2 times 2 squares with zero sums of the written numbers. The sum of all the numbers in the table is therefore equal to the sum of the numbers in the first row, so it is at most 4. A sum of 4 can be achieved if the table is filled such that the first, third, and fifth rows contain only 1, while the second and fourth rows contain only -1.]N3.

Is it possible to fill a square table with the numbers 1 and -1 so that the sum of the numbers in some column is even and in another column is odd? [No. In a square table n times n, there are n numbers in each column. If a of them are 1, the others are n-a and equal to -1, so the sum of the numbers in that column is a - (n-a) = 2a - n. This number is even, respectively odd, precisely when the number n is. Thus, all the sums of the numbers in the individual columns have the same parity. Another explanation: The parity of the sum of the numbers in a given column does not change if each -1 in it is replaced by 1.]D2.

It is sufficient to prove this for n=4, which precisely means that the common part of the following four intervals is not empty:I_{1}=(1 ; 2), quad I_{2}=(sqrt{2} ; sqrt{3}), quad I_{3}=(sqrt[3]{3} ; sqrt[3]{4}), quad I_{4}=(sqrt[4]{4} ; sqrt[4]{5})Since 1<sqrt{2}<sqrt{3}<2, it follows that I_{2} subset I_{1}. From the sequence of inequalities 2^{3}<3^{2}<4^{2}<3^{3}, taking the sixth root, we get that I_{3} subset I_{2}. Our claim now follows from the fact that the intersection of I_{3} and I_{4} is not empty. From the chain of inequalities 4^{3}<3^{4}<5^{3}<4^{4}, taking the 12th root,sqrt[4]{4}<sqrt[3]{3}<sqrt[4]{5}<sqrt[3]{4}so I_{3} cap I_{4}=(sqrt[3]{3} ; sqrt[4]{5}), and for example, 1.45 is an element of this interval.Thus, the system of inequalities is solvable for n=1,2,3, and 4.Remark.

By what percentage would the total number of apples change if there were three times as many White Naliv apples?","solution":"Answer: increased by 80 %.Solution. First method. If the amount of each type of apple were three times as much, the total number of apples would increase by 200 %. Of this, 70 % is due to the increase in Antonovka, and 50 % is due to the increase in Grushovka. Therefore, the increase due to White Naliv would be 200 %-70 %-50 %=80 %.Second method. Since adding twice the amount of Antonovka results in a 70 % increase, Antonovka makes up 0.35 of all apples. Similarly, Grushovka makes up 0.25 of all apples. Therefore, the share of White Naliv is 0.4.

Let's start by analyzing the first condition:   [   a_1 + a_2 neq a_3 + a_4   ]   Since (a_1 = 0), we have:   [   a_2 neq a_3 + a_4   ]3. Next, consider the second condition for (n = 1):   [   a_1 + a_2 + a_3 neq a_4 + a_5 + a_6   ]   Substituting (a_1 = 0), we get:   [   a_2 + a_3 neq a_4 + a_5 + a_6   ]4. From the first condition, we know (a_2 neq a_3 + a_4). Since (a_2) and (a_3 + a_4) are both either 0 or 1, this implies that (a_2) must be different from (a_3 + a_4). Therefore, if (a_2 = 0), then (a_3 + a_4 = 1), and if (a_2 = 1), then (a_3 + a_4 = 0).5. Now, let's consider the sequence starting with (a_1 = 0). We need to determine the values of (a_2, a_3, a_4, ldots) such that the given conditions are satisfied.6. Suppose (a_2 = 0). Then (a_3 + a_4 = 1). This means one of (a_3) or (a_4) is 1 and the other is 0. Without loss of generality, assume (a_3 = 1) and (a_4 = 0).7. Now, consider the second condition for (n = 2):   [   a_2 + a_3 + a_4 neq a_5 + a_6 + a_7   ]   Substituting (a_2 = 0), (a_3 = 1), and (a_4 = 0), we get:   [   0 + 1 + 0 neq a_5 + a_6 + a_7   ]   This simplifies to:   [   1 neq a_5 + a_6 + a_7   ]   Therefore, (a_5 + a_6 + a_7 neq 1). Since (a_5, a_6, a_7) are either 0 or 1, the only possible value for (a_5 + a_6 + a_7) is 0. Hence, (a_5 = a_6 = a_7 = 0).8.

What is the minimum number of games that must be played so that among any three teams, there are two that have already played against each other?","solution":"Answer: 90 games.Solution. We will consider the games that have not been played. The condition means that the unplayed games do not form triangles. We will prove by induction on k that for 2k teams, the maximum number of unplayed games is no more than k^2.Base case: k=1 (the estimate is obvious).Inductive step: Suppose it is proven for k, we will prove for k+1. If there are no unplayed games, then everything is proven. Otherwise, select any teams A and B that have not played against each other. Note that the number of unplayed games involving teams A or B is no more than 2k (not counting the game between A and B), since for any team C, at least one of the games AC and BC has been played. Now consider all teams except A and B and apply the inductive hypothesis - among them, no more than k^2 games have not been played. Therefore, the total number of unplayed games is no more than k^2 + (2k + 1) = (k+1)^2, which is what we needed to prove.Substituting k=10 gives that the number of unplayed games is no more than 100, and the total number of possible games is frac{20 cdot 19}{2} = 190, from which the number of played games is no less than 190 - 100 = 90.The estimate is achieved if the teams are divided into two equal groups, all matches are played within each group, and no matches are played between the groups."},{"problem":"6. Find all ordered triples (x, y, z) of mutually distinct real numbers which satisfy the set equation{x, y, z}=left{frac{x-y}{y-z}, frac{y-z}{z-x}, frac{z-x}{x-y}right} .","solution":"Solution. If x, y, z are three mutually distinct real numbers, thenu=frac{x-y}{y-z}, quad v=frac{y-z}{z-x}, quad w=frac{z-x}{x-y}are clearly numbers different from 0 and -1 whose product is equal to 1 . This property must therefore be possessed also by the values x, y, z from any such triple. We will thus assume from now on thatx, y, z in mathbb{R} backslash{0,-1}, quad x neq y neq z neq x, quad x y z=1 .Since the given set relation is the same for each of the ordered triples (x, y, z), (z, x, y) and (y, z, x), we will assume in addition to (2) that x>max {y, z}, and will distinguish two cases, according as y>z or z>y. Let us introduce the following notation for intervals: I_{1}=(0, infty), I_{2}=(-1,0), I_{3}=(-infty,-1).The case of x>y>z. For the fractions (1) we clearly have u in I_{1}, v in I_{2} and w in I_{3}, so u>v>w. The given set equation can thus be fulfilled only when u=x, v=y and w=z. Upon substituting from (1) and an easy manipulation we arrive at the equationsx y+y=y z+z=z x+x, quad text { where } x in I_{1}, y in I_{2}, z in I_{3} text {. }In view of the condition x y z=1 from (2) we can replace the term z x in the equation x y+y=z x+x by 1 / y. This leads tox y+y=frac{1}{y}+x Rightarrow x(y-1)=frac{1-y^{2}}{y} Rightarrow x=-frac{1+y}{y} Rightarrow y=-frac{1}{1+x} .(We have used the fact that, as y in I_{2}, necessarily y neq 1.) From the last formula it follows that the value of the first expression in the system (3) is -1 , so from the fact that the second expression equals -1 we obtainz=-frac{1}{1+y}=-frac{1}{1-frac{1}{1+x}}=-frac{1+x}{x} .But then also the third expression in (3) is equal to -1 . Any solution of our problem (in the current case of x>y>z ) must therefore be of the form(x, y, z)=left(t,-frac{1}{1+t},-frac{1+t}{t}right)where t in I_{1} is arbitrary (in view of (3), we do not need to worry about checks). From the procedure used it also follows that taking t in I_{2} (or t in I_{3}, respectively) in the formula (4) we get all solutions of our problem satisfying z>x>y(y>z>x), so that it is not necessary to list the cyclic permutations of the triples from (4) in our final answer below.The case of x>z>y. Now we have for the fractions (1) u in I_{3}, v in I_{1} and w in I_{2}, so v>w>u, and the set equation in question is satisfied only if u=y, v=x and w=z. Upon substituting the fractions from (1) we arrive at the systemx-y=y(y-z), quad y-z=x(z-x), quad z-x=z(x-y) .Adding up these three equations yields0=y(y-z)+x(z-x)+z(x-y)=(y-x)(x+y-2 z),which in view of x neq y implies that z=frac{1}{2}(x+y). Substituting this back into (5) we find (taking again into account that x neq y ) that the only solution is x=1, y=-2 and z=-frac{1}{2}. The same triple also forms the (unique) solution satisfying y>x>z, as well as the (unique) solution for which z>y>x.Answer: The solutions are all ordered triples (4), where t in mathbb{R} backslash{0,-1}, and the three triples (x, y, z) of the formleft(1,-2,-frac{1}{2}right),left(-frac{1}{2}, 1,-2right),left(-2,-frac{1}{2}, 1right) text {. }## Czech-Slovak-Polish Match  Bílovec, June 25-26, 2007mathbb{N} / mathbb{1}^{6}"},{"problem":"3.

What is the greatest possible sum of these 10 integers?","solution":"1. We start by noting that the product of 10 integers is 1024. We need to find the greatest possible sum of these 10 integers.2. Since 1024 is a power of 2, we can express it as (1024 = 2^{10}).3. To maximize the sum of the integers, we should use the smallest possible integers that multiply to 1024. The smallest integers that multiply to 1024 are all 2's, because (2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 = 2^{10} = 1024).4. However, using all 2's would give us a sum of (2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 20), which is not the greatest possible sum.5. To increase the sum, we can replace some of the 2's with larger integers, while ensuring the product remains 1024. For example, if we replace one of the 2's with a 4, we need to adjust another integer to maintain the product:   - Replacing one 2 with a 4: (4 times 2^8 = 1024). The sum is (4 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 20).6. We can continue this process by replacing more 2's with larger integers. For instance, replacing two 2's with an 8:   - Replacing two 2's with an 8: (8 times 2^7 = 1024). The sum is (8 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 22).7. We can further optimize by replacing three 2's with a 16:   - Replacing three 2's with a 16: (16 times 2^6 = 1024). The sum is (16 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 28).8. Continuing this process, we find that the optimal configuration is to use one 1024 and nine 1's:   - (1024 times 1^9 = 1024). The sum is (1024 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 1033).The final answer is (boxed{1033})."},{"problem":"3.

The condition of the problem means that the system (21) must have a solution with respect to (a ; b), that is, all three circles must have at least one common point.Let the circles bounding omega_{2} and omega_{3} intersect at points C and D (then triangles A B C and A B D are equilateral). The intersection of circles omega_{2} and omega_{3} is a figure F, representing the union of two smaller segments of these circles, bounded by the chord C D.

We start with the equation xy = x + y + 3. 2. Since x, y > 0, we can use the AM-GM inequality: frac{x + y}{2} geq sqrt{xy}, which implies xy leq left(frac{x+y}{2}right)^2.3. Let x+y = t > 0, then our inequality becomes t + 3 leq frac{t^2}{4}.4. Rearranging the inequality gives frac{t^2}{4} - t - 3 geq 0, which simplifies to left(t-6right)left(t+2right) geq 0.5. Solving this inequality, we find t geq 6 because t > 0 implies we ignore the solution that gives us negative t.6. Therefore, we deduce that x+y geq 6. The equality holds when x = y = 3.So, the range of values for x+y is boxed{[6,+infty)}.# Part 2: Finding the range of values for xyGiven the same conditions as above, now we are finding the range for xy.1. Starting again with xy = x + y + 3.2. By rearranging and applying the AM-GM inequality in a different way, we get xy - 3 = x + y geq 2sqrt{xy}, which implies xy geq 2sqrt{xy} + 3.3. Letting sqrt{xy} = m > 0, we have m^2 geq 2m + 3.4. Rearranging gives m^2 - 2m - 3 geq 0, which simplifies to (m-3)(m+1) geq 0.5. Solving this inequality, m geq 3 because m > 0.6. This means xy geq 9. The equality occurs when x = y = 3.Thus, the range of values for xy is boxed{[9,+infty)}."},{"problem":"Given that the function y=tan omega xleft(omega  gt 0right) has a minimum positive period of frac{π}{2}, find omega.","solution":"Given that the function y=tan omega xleft(omega gt 0right) has a minimum positive period of frac{π}{2}, we aim to find the value of omega.The general period of the tangent function, tan(theta), is pi.

However, without completing the square, we can directly read off the center of the circle by using the formula for a circle's equation (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2, where (a, b) is the center.

In the following considerations, p, q, r will always denote prime numbers, and x, y, z natural numbers. First, we will prove four lemmas.Lemma 1. The only solution to the equation 2^{x}-1=3^{y} is x=2, y=1.Proof. Let for natural numbers x and y it holds that 2^{x}-1=3^{y}.

Since the numbers 2^{l}-1 and 2^{l}+1 are coprime (they are odd and differ by 2), from the last equation it easily follows that l=1, x=2 and y=1.Lemma 2. The equation 2^{x}+1=3^{y} has exactly two solutions: x=y=1 and x=3, y=2.Proof. It is easily seen that x=y=1 is a solution to the equation 2^{x}+1=3^{y}. Let y>1. Then from the equation2^{x}=3^{y}-1=2left(3^{y-1}+3^{y-2}+ldots+3+1right)it follows that y=2 l, l in mathbb{N}, and further we get2^{x}=left(3^{l}-1right)left(3^{l}+1right)from which it easily follows that l=1, y=2, x=3.Lemma 3. The equation p^{x}-1=2^{y}, where p>3 and x>1 has no solutions.Proof. Since p is an odd number, from the equation(p-1)left(p^{x-1}+p^{x-2}+ldots+p+1right)=2^{y}it follows that x=2 l, l in mathbb{N}. Now the equation takes the formleft(p^{l}-1right)left(p^{l}+1right)=2^{y}and has the solution p=3, l=1, y=3, since the only two powers of 2 that differ by 2 are p^{l}-1=2^{1} and p^{l}+1=2^{2}.Lemma 4. The equation p^{x}+1=2^{y}, where p>3 and x>1 has no solutions.Proof. Let p>3 and x>1. We will consider the following cases.Case 1. y=2 k, k in mathbb{N}. Then the number 2^{y}-1=2^{2 k}-1=4^{k}-1 is divisible by 3, which is a contradiction because it is equal to p^{x}, and its only prime divisor is the number p>3.Case 2. x=2 k+1, k in mathbb{N}. Thenp^{x}+1=(p+1)left(p^{x-1}+p^{x-2}+ldots+1 p+1right)=(p+1) A=2^{y}Here the number A is odd and is a power of the number 2. Therefore, A=1, so x=1, which is a contradiction.Case 3. y=2 k+1, x=2 l, k, l in mathbb{N}. The number p is of the form p=4 m pm 1, where m in mathbb{N}. Therefore,begin{aligned}& p^{x}+1=1+(1 pm 4 m)^{2 l}=2 pm cdot 4 m+binom{2 l}{2}(4 m)^{2} pm ldots equiv 2(bmod 8) & 2^{y}=2^{2 k+1} equiv 0(bmod 8)end{aligned}which is a contradiction.Now we will determine the solutions to the given equation.a) Let p=2. The equation takes the form:left(2^{x}-1right)left(2^{x}+1right)=q^{y} r^{z}The numbers 2^{x}-1 and 2^{x}+1 are coprime and one is divisible by 3. From the condition that the number left(2^{X}-1right)left(2^{X}+1right) has exactly two different prime divisors, it follows that one of the numbers 2^{x}-1 and 2^{x}+1 is a power of the number 3. Using lemmas 1 and 2, we get the following solutions to the given equation:(2,3,5,2,1,1), quad(2,5,3,2,1,1),(2,3,7,3,2,1), quad(2,7,3,3,1,2)b) Let p=3. The equation takes the formleft(3^{x}-1right)left(3^{x}+1right)=q^{y} r^{z}The numbers 3^{x}-1 and 3^{x}+1 are consecutive even numbers, so their greatest common divisor is equal to 2. From the condition that the product of these two numbers has at most two different prime divisors, it follows that one of them is a power of the number 2. Now, using lemmas 1 and 2, we easily get that the only solutions to the given equation where p=3 are:(3,2,2,1,1,2),(3,2,2,1,2,1),(3,2,5,2,4,1),(3,5,2,2,1,4)c) Let p>3 and left(p^{x}-1right)left(p^{x}+1right)=q^{y} r^{z}. One of the numbers p^{x}-1 and p^{x}+1 is divisible by 3, and each of them is an even number. Therefore, one of these two numbers is a power of the number 2, and one is of the form 2 cdot 3^{z}. From lemmas 3 and 4 it follows that x=1.If p-1=2^{y-1}, p+1=2 cdot 3^{z}, then 2^{y-2}+1=3^{z}. Using lemma 2, we get y=3, z=1, p=5 or y=5, z=2, p=17, and the solutions to the given equation in these cases are:(5,2,3,1,3,1),(5,3,2,1,1,3),(17,2,3,1,5,2),(17,3,2,1,2,5)If p+1=2^{y-1}, p-1=2 cdot 3^{z}, then 2^{y-2}-1=3^{z}.

We need to find the residue of ( n ) when divided by 17.

To prove this, we recursively define the sequences ({m_i}_{i=1}^infty) and ({n_i}_{i=1}^infty) as follows:   [   m_1 = n_1 = 1, quad m_{i+1} = 3m_i + 4n_i, quad n_{i+1} = 2m_i + 3n_i quad (i ge 1)   ]4. By a well-known lemma on Pell equations, we know that ((m, n) = (m_j, n_j)) for some (j ge 1). We need to check the residues of (n) modulo 11 and 17.5. First, we check (n) modulo 11. We know that (n^2 equiv 3 pmod{11}), which implies (n equiv pm 5 pmod{11}). We check the sequence ((m_i, n_i)) modulo 11:   [   (1, 1) rightarrow (7, 5) rightarrow (8, 7) rightarrow (8, 4) rightarrow (7, 6) rightarrow (1, -1) rightarrow (-1, -1) rightarrow (-7, -5) rightarrow (-8, -7) rightarrow (-8, -4) rightarrow (-7, 5) rightarrow (-1, 1) rightarrow (1, 1) rightarrow dots   ]   This implies (j equiv 2 pmod{3}).6. Next, we check (n) modulo 17. We observe the sequence ((m_i, n_i)) modulo 17:   [   (1, 1) rightarrow (7, 5) rightarrow (7, 12) rightarrow (1, -1) rightarrow (-1, -1) rightarrow (-7, 12) rightarrow (-7, 5) rightarrow (-1, 1) rightarrow (1, 1) rightarrow dots   ]   This sequence does not provide direct information about (n) modulo 17.7. We use the equation ((2n-1)(2n+1) = 4n^2 - 1 = 11k^2). Since (2n-1) and (2n+1) are positive, we consider two cases:   [   begin{cases}   2n-1 = 11u^2    2n+1 = v^2   end{cases}   quad text{or} quad   begin{cases}   2n+1 = 11u^2    2n-1 = v^2   end{cases}   ]8.

Hence, (j equiv 2, 11 pmod{12}), or (j equiv 2, 3 pmod{4}). This leads to (n equiv pm 5 pmod{17}).10. We need to prove that (n equiv -5 pmod{17}) is impossible.

Triangles FOB and FOK are equal (they are right triangles, FO is common, and FB=FK), so BO=OK. In the plane of the base ABC, draw a line l passing through point O parallel to AC and denote L=l cap BK, M=l cap AB, N=l cap BC. Since AB=BC, the median BK perp AC, and thus OL perp BK.

In the plane ABC, draw a line m through point O parallel to AB. By the condition, this line lies in the cutting plane pi. Denote P=m cap AC, Q=m cap BC. From Thales' theorem, BQ=3QN. Since MN is the midline, we get CQ:CB=CP:CA=5:8. Denote the point of intersection of the plane pi and the edge FC as R - by the condition CR:CF=4:5.

Can a regular tetrahedron with an edge of 1 pass through a circular hole with a radius of: a) 0.45; b) 0.44? (The thickness of the hole can be neglected.)## Problems for Independent Solving","solution":"11.20. In the process of a tetrahedron passing through an opening, there will inevitably be a moment when vertex ( B ) is on one side of the plane of the opening, vertex ( A ) is in the plane of the opening, and vertices ( C ) and ( D ) are on the other side of the plane of the opening (or in the plane of the opening). Let at this moment the plane of the opening intersect the edges ( BC ) and ( BD ) at points ( M ) and ( N ); the circle of the opening contains the triangle ( AMN ). We will now determine in which position of points ( M ) and ( N ) the radius of the smallest circle containing the triangle ( AMN ) will be the smallest.First, let's assume that the triangle ( AMN ) is acute-angled. Then the smallest circle containing it is its circumcircle (see Prasolov, II, 15.127). If the sphere, whose equator is the circumcircle of the triangle ( AMN ), does not touch, for example, the edge ( BC ), then inside this sphere on the edge ( BC ) we can take a point ( M' ) near ( M ) such that the triangle ( AM'N ) is acute-angled and the radius of its circumcircle is less than the radius of the circumcircle of the triangle ( AMN ). Therefore, in the position where the radius of the circumcircle of the triangle ( AMN ) is minimal, the considered sphere touches the edges ( BC ) and ( BD ), and thus ( BM = BN = x ). The triangle ( AMN ) is isosceles, and in it ( MN = x ), ( AM = AN = sqrt{x^2 - x + 1} ). Let ( K ) be the midpoint of ( MN ), and ( L ) be the projection of ( B ) onto the plane ( AMN ). Since the center of the sphere lies in this plane, and the lines ( BM ) and ( BN ) are tangent to the given sphere, ( LN ) and ( LM ) are tangents to the circumcircle of the triangle ( AMN ). If ( angle MAN = alpha ), then ( LK = MK lg alpha = x^2 sqrt{3x^2 - 4x + 4 / 2} (x^2 - 2x + 2) ). In the triangle ( A ), the angle ( AKB = beta ) is obtuse and ( cos beta = (3x - 2) / sqrt{3(3x^2 - 4x + 4)} ). Therefore, ( LK = -KB cos beta = x(2 - 3x) / 2 sqrt{3x^2 - 4x + 4} ). Equating the two expressions for ( LK ), we get the equation for ( x ):[3x^3 - 6x^2 + 7x - 2 = 0]The radius ( R ) of the circumcircle of the triangle ( AMN ) is ( (x^2 - x + 1) / sqrt{3x^2 - 4x + 4} ). Approximate calculations of the roots of the equation give values ( x approx 0.3913 ), ( R approx 0.4478 ) (with an error not exceeding 0.00005).Now let's assume that the triangle ( AMN ) is not acute-angled. Let ( BM = x ), ( BN = y ). Then ( AM^2 = 1 - x + x^2 ), ( AN^2 = 1 - y + y^2 ), and ( MN^2 = x^2 + y^2 - xy ). Since ( angle MAN ) is acute, ( AM^2 + AN^2 > MN^2 ). Suppose for definiteness that the angle ( angle ANM ) is not acute, i.e., ( 1 - x + x^2 geq (x^2 + y^2 - xy) + (1 - y + y^2) ). Then ( 0 leq x leq y(1 - 2y) / (1 - y) ), so ( y leq 0.5 ), and thus ( x leq 2y(1 - 2y) leq 1/4 ). On the segment [0, 1/2], the quadratic polynomial ( 1 - x + x^2 ) decreases, so ( AM^2 geq 1 - 1/4 + 1/16 = 13/16 > (0.9)^2 ), i.e., in the case of an obtuse-angled triangle ( AMN ), the radius of the smallest circle containing it is greater than in the case of an acute-angled triangle.We will now prove that the tetrahedron can pass through the opening of the found radius ( R ). We will mark segments of length ( x ), where ( x ) is the root of equation (1), on the edges of the tetrahedron as shown in Fig. 84, and perform the following sequence of movements:a) position the tetrahedron so that the circle of the opening is the circumcircle of the triangle ( AMN ), and rotate the tetrahedron around the line ( MN ) until point ( V ) reaches the plane of the opening;b) move the tetrahedron so that the plane ( VMN ) remains parallel to its original position, and points ( P ) and ( Q ) reach the boundary of the opening;c) rotate the tetrahedron around the line ( PQ ) until vertex ( D ) reaches the plane of the opening.We will prove that all these operations are feasible. When rotating the tetrahedron around the line ( MN ), the plane of the opening intersects it along a trapezoid, the diagonal of which decreases from ( NA ) to ( NV ), and the acute angle at the larger base increases to ( 90^circ ). Therefore, the radius of the circumcircle of the trapezoid decreases. Hence, operation a) and the analogous operation c) are feasible.Take a point ( T ) on the edge ( DC ). The section of the tetrahedron ( ABCD ), parallel to ( VMN ) and passing through point ( T ), is a rectangle with a diagonal ( sqrt{t^2 + (1 - t)^2} = sqrt{2(t - 0.5)^2 + 0.5^2} ), where ( t = BT ). This implies the feasibility of operation b).Answer: the tetrahedron can pass through an opening of radius 0.45, but it cannot pass through an opening of radius 0.4."},{"problem":"In the first three quarters of the year 2022, the GDP of Chengdu city was approximately 15000 billion yuan.

Let O be the intersection point of segments A_1C and DE. From the equality of right triangles A_1OE and COD (by hypotenuse and acute angle), it follows that O is the midpoint of A_1C. Therefore, the perpendicular dropped from point O to AC passes through point M, and since the prism is straight, this perpendicular lies in the plane of the face AA_1C_1C.Let K be the intersection point of the cutting plane with the line AB. The line A_1C is perpendicular to the cutting plane containing the line DK, so A_1C perp DK. By the theorem of three perpendiculars, DK perp AC, since AC is the orthogonal projection of the inclined line A_1C onto the plane ABC. TrianglesADK and AMB are similar with a coefficient k = frac{AD}{AM} = frac{2}{3}, soAK = k cdot AB = frac{2}{3} AB < AB.Thus, point K lies on the segment AB.

Consider the face AA_1C_1C (Fig. 3). Denote angle A_1CC_1 = angle EE_2D = alpha.

Therefore, alpha = 60^circ.Since CD perp KD and ED perp KD, the angle EDC is the linear angle of the dihedral angle between the cutting plane and the plane ABC, and since angle EDC = alpha = 60^circ, then, by the theorem of the area of the orthogonal projection of a polygon,S_{DKNPE} = frac{S_{DKBP_2E_2}}{cos alpha} = frac{frac{20}{3}}{frac{1}{2}} = frac{40}{3}."},{"problem":"During the holiday, a school organizes a trip for 360 teachers and students.

If we rent only Type A buses, we need 360 div 40 = 9 buses. If we rent only Type B buses, we need 8 buses.

Initially, all the lamps are off. In another room are 15 switches: one switch for lamp 1 and 2, one switch for lamp 2 and 3, one switch for lamp 3 and 4, and so on, up to a switch for lamp 15 and 1. When the switch for such a pair of lamps is flipped, the status of each of those two lamps changes (from on to off or vice versa). The switches are hung in a random order and all look identical. Raymond wants to find out which switch corresponds to which pair of lamps. From the room with the switches, he cannot see the lamps. He can, however, flip a number of switches and then go to the other room to see which lamps are on. He can do this multiple times. How many times must he minimally go to the other room to be certain of which switch corresponds to which pair of lamps?","solution":"With three rounds of walking, Raymond can never be certain. After all, if you note for each switch whether it is in the initial position or the flipped position in the three rounds, you can get 2^{3}=8 different patterns. However, there are 15 switches, so there are multiple switches with the same pattern, and Raymond can never distinguish these switches from each other. Therefore, he must walk at least four times. We will prove that this is indeed sufficient.Assume that Raymond, starting from the situation where all lights are off, flips a number of switches. If he flips all the switches or none at all, then all the lights will remain off afterward. Otherwise, there will always be a light that has been changed by only one flipped switch, so it will be on. Consider such a light i that is on. Then the switch with i-1 and i or the switch with i and i+1 has been flipped. (Consider the light numbers modulo 15.) First, assume that the latter is the case. Now consider light i+1. If it is off, then the switch with i+1 and i+2 has also been flipped; if the light is on, then that switch has not been used. Next, we can deduce from the status of light i+2 whether the switch with i+2 and i+3 has been flipped or not. By continuing this process, we see that the status of all switches is determined. In the second case, if the switch with i-1 and i has been flipped, then the status of all switches is also determined. Therefore, there are exactly two combinations of switches that result in the same status of the lights. If we choose one of these combinations and then flip all 15 switches again, the same lights will be on, so this must result in the second combination of switches. If the first combination of switches contains an even number of switches, then the second combination contains 15 minus that number, so an odd number of switches.However, Raymond knows himself how many switches he has flipped. He can deduce from the status of the lights which two combinations of switches are possible, and only one of these can match the number of switches he has flipped. Therefore, he can precisely determine which lights the switches he has flipped correspond to; he only does not know which is which within that group of switches.Write the numbers 1 to 15 in binary notation. For this, a maximum of 4 digits are needed; pad with zeros if necessary so that each number is written with exactly 4 digits. Raymond numbers the switches with these binary numbers. In the first round, he flips the switches whose numbers in binary notation start with a 1 and notes the 8 corresponding light pairs. In the second round, he first resets all switches and then selects the numbers that have a 1 in the second position in binary notation. Similarly, in the third round, he selects the third position in the binary notation, and in the fourth round, the fourth position. In each round, he can determine which light pairs the switches he has used correspond to (only not which is which). Since each switch corresponds to a unique combination of rounds, he can then deduce from each switch which light pair it controls. For example, if a certain light pair is turned on in the first round, not in the second round, in the third round, and also in the fourth round, then it corresponds to the switch with binary code 1011, which is switch 11. Therefore, he can succeed in four rounds of walking."},{"problem":"Given a sequence {a_n}, its first n terms sum is S_n. a_1= frac {1}{5}, and for any positive integers m, n, a_{n+m}=a_{n}⋅a_{m}.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to divide a 99-ladder into rectangles such that all rectangles have distinct areas. The 99-ladder consists of all squares on or below the main diagonal of a 99 times 99 board.2. Counting the Total Number of Squares:   The total number of squares in an n-ladder is given by the sum of the first n natural numbers:   [   1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + n = frac{n(n+1)}{2}   ]   For n = 99, the total number of squares is:   [   frac{99 times 100}{2} = 4950   ]3. Distinct Areas Requirement:   Since all rectangles must have distinct areas, the areas must be the first 99 natural numbers: 1, 2, 3, ldots, 99.4. Placement of Rectangles:   Each rectangle must have a unique area, and the only way to ensure this is to place them in a specific manner. The largest rectangle (area 99) must be placed first, and it can only be placed in two ways: either horizontally or vertically.5. Recursive Placement:   After placing the largest rectangle, we are left with a (99-1)-ladder, i.e., a 98-ladder. The same logic applies recursively to the 98-ladder, 97-ladder, and so on.6.

Therefore, the total number of ways to place all rectangles is:   [   2^{n-1}   ]   For n = 99, the number of ways is:   [   2^{99-1} = 2^{98}   ]Conclusion:[boxed{2^{98}}]"},{"problem":"If a line l is translated 3 units to the left along the x-axis, and then 1 unit up along the y-axis, returning to its original position, then the slope of line l is ______.","solution":"To analyze the problem, let's start with the initial equation of line l, which can be expressed as y = kx + b. This equation represents any straight line on a Cartesian plane, where k is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept.1. First Translation (3 units to the left along the x-axis): When the line is translated 3 units to the left, every x in the equation is replaced by (x + 3). This is because moving to the left on the x-axis means decreasing the x-value, but in the equation, we compensate by adding 3 to x. Therefore, the equation becomes:   [y = k(x + 3) + b]2. Second Translation (1 unit up along the y-axis): After the first translation, moving the line 1 unit up means increasing the y-value by 1. So, we add 1 to the right side of the equation obtained from the first translation. The equation now becomes:   [y = k(x + 3) + b + 1]   Simplifying, we get:   [y = kx + 3k + b + 1]3. Returning to the Original Position: For the line to return to its original position, the equation after both translations must be identical to the original equation of the line, which is y = kx + b. This implies that the changes made to the equation must result in no net change. Therefore, comparing the coefficients from the original equation and the transformed equation, we get:   [kx + 3k + b + 1 = kx + b]   Simplifying this, we find that the terms involving x are identical on both sides, so we focus on the constants:   [3k + b + 1 = b]   Subtracting b from both sides, we get:   [3k + 1 = 0]   Solving for k, we find:   [3k = -1]   [k = -frac{1}{3}]Thus, the slope of line l is -frac{1}{3}.

We need to calculate  F (6) .Suppose we incorrectly place all letters by putting letter  L_1  in envelope  K_i  ( i ne 1 ). There are  2  cases:a) Letter  L_i  ends up in envelope  K_1 . The remaining  4  letters must then be incorrectly placed in the remaining  4  envelopes, which can be done in  F (4)  ways.

We start by understanding the definitions of ( u(n) ) and ( v(n) ):   - ( u(n) ) is the largest prime number less than or equal to ( n ).   - ( v(n) ) is the smallest prime number larger than ( n ).2. We need to prove the following sum:   [   sum_{n=2}^{2010} frac{1}{u(n)v(n)} = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2011}   ]3. Let's denote the (i)-th prime number by ( p_i ). For example, ( p_1 = 2 ), ( p_2 = 3 ), ( p_3 = 5 ), and so on.4. Consider the term ( frac{1}{u(n)v(n)} ). If ( n ) is between two consecutive primes ( p_i ) and ( p_{i+1} ), then ( u(n) = p_i ) and ( v(n) = p_{i+1} ). This term will appear ( p_{i+1} - p_i ) times in the sum.5. Therefore, we can rewrite the sum as:   [   sum_{i=1}^{k-1} sum_{n=p_i}^{p_{i+1}-1} frac{1}{p_i p_{i+1}}   ]   where ( k ) is such that ( p_k = 2011 ).6. Each inner sum ( sum_{n=p_i}^{p_{i+1}-1} frac{1}{p_i p_{i+1}} ) has ( p_{i+1} - p_i ) terms, each equal to ( frac{1}{p_i p_{i+1}} ). Therefore, the inner sum simplifies to:   [   sum_{n=p_i}^{p_{i+1}-1} frac{1}{p_i p_{i+1}} = (p_{i+1} - p_i) cdot frac{1}{p_i p_{i+1}} = frac{p_{i+1} - p_i}{p_i p_{i+1}}   ]7. Summing over all such intervals, we get:   [   sum_{i=1}^{k-1} frac{p_{i+1} - p_i}{p_i p_{i+1}}   ]8. Notice that:   [   frac{p_{i+1} - p_i}{p_i p_{i+1}} = frac{1}{p_i} - frac{1}{p_{i+1}}   ]9. Therefore, the sum becomes a telescoping series:   [   sum_{i=1}^{k-1} left( frac{1}{p_i} - frac{1}{p_{i+1}} right)   ]10. The telescoping series simplifies to:    [    left( frac{1}{p_1} - frac{1}{p_2} right) + left( frac{1}{p_2} - frac{1}{p_3} right) + cdots + left( frac{1}{p_{k-1}} - frac{1}{p_k} right)    ]11.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to determine the maximum number of \\"good\\" pairs ((i, j)) where (1 leq i leq j leq 2n-1) and the number of blue numbers among (i, i+1, ldots, j) is odd.2. Constructing the Graph:   Let's construct a graph (G) with vertices labeled (1, 2, ldots, 2n-1). We will connect vertices (i) and (j) (where (i < j)) if the segment ([i, j]) contains an odd number of blue numbers.3. Graph Properties:   Observe that this graph is triangle-free. This is because if there were a triangle, say with vertices (a, b, c) (where (a < b < c)), then the segments ([a, b]), ([b, c]), and ([a, c]) would all need to have an odd number of blue numbers. However, the union of two segments with an odd number of blue numbers would result in an even number of blue numbers, contradicting the condition for the third segment.4. Applying Turán's Theorem:   Turán's theorem states that a triangle-free graph on (n) vertices has at most (leftlfloor frac{n^2}{4} rightrfloor) edges. In our case, the number of vertices is (2n-1), so the maximum number of edges is:   [   leftlfloor frac{(2n-1)^2}{4} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{4n^2 - 4n + 1}{4} rightrfloor = leftlfloor n^2 - n + frac{1}{4} rightrfloor = n^2 - n   ]5. Constructing the Optimal Coloring:   To achieve the maximum number of good pairs, we can color exactly (n) numbers blue. This ensures that every segment containing exactly one blue number is a good pair. The number of such segments is:   [   sum_{k=1}^{n} k = frac{n(n+1)}{2}   ]   However, this does not directly give us the maximum number of good pairs. Instead, we need to consider the total number of segments and ensure that the number of blue numbers is odd in as many segments as possible.6. Final Calculation:   By carefully choosing the positions of the blue numbers, we can ensure that the number of good pairs is maximized. The optimal configuration is to place (n) blue numbers such that each segment containing an odd number of blue numbers is counted. This results in:   [   n^2   ]   good pairs.Therefore, the maximum number of good pairs is (boxed{n^2})."},{"problem":"92. Given a right triangle with sides 9, 12, 15.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to determine if the number (2021^{2021}) is fantabulous given the properties of fantabulous numbers. Specifically, if any element of the set ({m, 2m+1, 3m}) is fantabulous, then all elements of the set are fantabulous.2. Initial Claims:   - Claim: (m) is fantabulous if (2m+1) is fantabulous, and (2m+1) is fantabulous if (m) is fantabulous.   - Claim: (m) is fantabulous if (2m) is fantabulous, and (2m) is fantabulous if (m) is fantabulous.3. Proof of Claims:   - For the first claim, if (2m+1) is fantabulous, then by the given property, (m) must also be fantabulous. Similarly, if (m) is fantabulous, then (2m+1) must be fantabulous.   - For the second claim, consider the chain (2m to 4m+1 to 12m+3 to 6m+1 to 3m to m). This chain shows that if (2m) is fantabulous, then (m) is fantabulous. The reverse chain shows that if (m) is fantabulous, then (2m) is fantabulous.4.

If (n) is odd, we can subtract 1 and then divide by 2 to find another fantabulous number. This process can be repeated until we reach 1.5.

This is equivalent to solving the problem of putting 4 distinct balls into 3 distinct boxes where each box must contain at least one ball.The solution can be approached by considering the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion or by direct enumeration. However, the simplest approach in this context is to consider the possible distributions:1. 3 books for one person, 1 book for another, and none for the last: This is not allowed since each person must choose at least one book.2. 2 books for one person, 1 book for the second person, and 1 book for the third person: This scenario is allowed. To distribute the books in this manner, we first choose the person to receive 2 books in C_3^1 = 3 ways. Then, we choose 2 books out of 4 for this person in C_4^2 = 6 ways. The remaining 2 books can be distributed to the other two people in 2! = 2 ways (since the two books are distinct and the two people are distinct).Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the books is 3 times 6 times 2 = 36.However, this calculation does not match the provided solution of 60 ways.

Therefore, the sum of the digits of the sum of any number of addends does not exceed the sum of the digits of the addends. As a consequence, S(n) leq n, since n=1+1+ldots+1 (n ones), and equality is achieved only for single-digit numbers, because when adding another one to the sum of nine ones, a carry will already occur. In addition, appending a zero to the right does not change the sum of the digits, that is, S(10 n)=S(n).Let the desired two-digit number A=underline{a b=10 a+b}. ThenSleft(A^{2}right)=Sleft((10 a+b)^{2}right)=Sleft(100 a^{2}+10^{*} 2 a b+b^{2}right) leqleq Sleft(100 a^{2}right)+Sleft(10^{*} 2 a bright)+Sleft(b^{2}right)=Sleft(a^{2}right)+S(2 a b)+Sleft(b^{2}right) leqleq a^{2}+2 a b+b^{2}=(a+b)^{2}=(S(A))^{2}, and equality is achieved if and only if a^{2}, 2 a b, and b^{2} are single-digit numbers (if so, then when adding 100 a^{2}, 10 * 2 a b, and b^{2}, no carries occur, since they contain all their non-zero digits in different places). Therefore, it is necessary and sufficient that the numbers a^{2}, b^{2}, and 2 a b be less than 10, that is, 1 leq a leq 3,0 leq b leq 3 and a b leq 4.From this, we find all the options listed in the answer.Author: Kalinin D.A.The product of five numbers is not zero.

For a natural number ending not in zero, one of its digits was replaced by zero (if it is the leading digit, it was simply erased). As a result, the number decreased by 9 times. How many numbers exist for which this is possible?","solution":"Answer: 7.Solution. Let's represent the original number in the form m+10^{k} a+10^{k+1} n, where a is a decimal digit, and k, m, n are non-negative integers, with m>0, otherwise m=a=0. Then the number 8 m is a multiple of 10 and therefore ends in 0. By the condition, the number m does not end in 0. Thus, the last digit of m is 5 and the number m is odd. Therefore, 8 m is not divisible by 16, which implies k leqslant 3. Let's consider three cases.1) Suppose k=3. Then m=125 a. Since the number m is odd and less than 1000, the digit a can take the values 1,3,5,7, which gives us 4 options.2) Suppose k=2. Then m=frac{25 a}{2}. Since the number m is odd and less than 100, the digit a is 2 or 6. These values give us another 2 options.3) Suppose k=1. Then m=frac{5 a}{4}. Since the number m is odd and less than 10, we get a=4.Note that in 1) we get four-digit numbers, in 2) - three-digit numbers, in 3) - two-digit numbers. Therefore, each number satisfying the condition of the problem falls into exactly one of the sets 1) - 3).

Thus, the diagonal of this rectangular prism is the diameter of its circumscribed sphere.Let the edge length of the original cube be a, and the radius of the sphere be R. According to the properties of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we have (2R)^2 = a^2 + a^2 + (2a)^2, which simplifies to 4R^2 = 6a^2. Therefore, R = frac{sqrt{6}}{2}a.Consequently, the surface area of the hemisphere, S_{text{hemisphere}} = 3pi R^2 = frac{9}{2}pi a^2, and the surface area of the cube, S_{text{cube}} = 6a^2.Therefore, the ratio of the surface area of the hemisphere to the surface area of the cube is 3pi : 4.Hence, the answer is boxed{3pi : 4}.This problem examines the relationship between the surface area of a sphere and that of a cube, testing the student's computational skills.

The frequencies fluctuate but are generally close to a central value. By examining these values, we can determine that they center around the value of 0.600.

Find all real functions f:Mtomathbb{R} such that for any circle mathcal{C} containing at least three points from M, the following equality holds:[sum_{Pinmathcal{C}cap M} f(P)=0][i]Dorel Mihet[/i]","solution":"1. Define Interesting Circles:   Call the circles which contain at least three of the points from ( M ) interesting. The problem's conditions tell us that every triplet of the points belongs to exactly one interesting circle.2. Lemma:   [   sum_{P in M} f(P) = 0   ]   Proof:   For a triplet of points ( T = {P, Q, R} ), let ( f(T) = f(P) + f(Q) + f(R) ). Consider ( sum_{T subset M} f(T) ), with ( T ) ranging over every possible triplet.3. Counting Triplets:   On one hand, every point of ( M ) is included in exactly ( binom{n-1}{2} ) triplets, so:   [   sum_{T subset M} f(T) = binom{n-1}{2} sum_{P in M} f(P)   ]4. Triplets on Interesting Circles:   On the other hand, suppose we choose an interesting circle ( mathcal{C} ) and count all the triplets which are entirely on it. If the circle has ( k ) points from ( M ), each point will be included in ( binom{k-1}{2} ) triplets; thus:   [   sum_{T subset M cap mathcal{C}} f(T) = binom{k-1}{2} sum_{P in M cap mathcal{C}} f(P) = 0   ]   because ( sum_{P in M cap mathcal{C}} f(P) = 0 ) by the problem's condition.5. Summing Over All Interesting Circles:   Now we simply sum over all interesting circles; since each triplet is included in exactly one interesting circle, we have:   [   sum_{T subset M} f(T) = 0   ]   Combining these two equations proves the lemma:   [   binom{n-1}{2} sum_{P in M} f(P) = 0 implies sum_{P in M} f(P) = 0   ]6. Analyzing Points on Circles:   Let ( A ) and ( B ) be two arbitrary points and let ( S ) be the set of all interesting circles which pass through both of them. Not all of the points of ( M ) are concyclic, hence ( |S| > 1 ). Also, every point other than ( A ) and ( B ) which is in ( M ) is in exactly one circle of ( S ), so:   [   0 = sum_{mathcal{C} in S} sum_{P in mathcal{C} cap M} f(P) = |S|(f(A) + f(B)) + sum_{P in M setminus {A, B}} f(P)   ]   Applying the lemma, we have:   [   0 = (|S| - 1)(f(A) + f(B))   ]   Since ( |S| > 1 ), we know:   [   f(A) + f(B) = 0   ]7. Conclusion:   For three arbitrary points ( A, B, C ), we have:   [   2f(A) = (f(A) + f(B)) + (f(A) + f(C)) - (f(B) + f(C)) = 0   ]   So the only function that works is the zero function:   [   f(P) = 0 quad text{for all} quad P in M   ]The final answer is ( boxed{ f(P) = 0 } ) for all ( P in M )."}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(i=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return i.problem.toLowerCase().includes(e)||i.solution.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},I={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},z=["disabled"],M={key:0},L={key:1};function O(i,e,h,d,o,r){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔 AI effective tips collection 🧠")])],-1)),t("div",I,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),p(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,o.searchQuery]])]),t("div",P,[(a(!0),n(x,null,w(r.filteredPoems,(s,u)=>(a(),y(m,{key:u,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:o.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...s)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...s))},[o.isLoading?(a(),n("span",L,"Loading...")):(a(),n("span",M,"See more"))],8,z)):v("",!0)])}const N=f(F,[["render",O],["__scopeId","data-v-fe7b2dff"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/57.md","filePath":"drive/57.md"}'),E={name:"drive/57.md"},W=Object.assign(E,{setup(i){return(e,h)=>(a(),n("div",null,[_(N)]))}});export{G as __pageData,W as default};
