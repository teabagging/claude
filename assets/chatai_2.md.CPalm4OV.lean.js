Will this symptom go away?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Lexapro (escitalopram) can cause lack of energy and fatigue in many people. This can also cause  arthralgia, neck/shoulder pain, muscle cramp, and myalgia in some people. Jaw stiffness, muscle stiffness, arthritis, muscle weakness, arthropathy, back discomfort, joint stiffness, and jaw pain have been reported infrequently in patients on Lexapro.These side effects happen at the start of treatment and then this can slowly improves with continuation of treatment which can take about 15 days or more. This side effect is seen more in the first month and usually is under control after 6 months of taking the medication.

Was she in any pain & why did she not fie immediately but died 3 days later? Could she have felt any pain during this?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in to us.Sorry to hear about the loss of your mother. The brain is an important organ and a stroke can cause deficient blood supply or leakage of blood in to the brain as the case might be. The end result is decreased functioning of brain and this continues till the brain cannot sustain itself. Coming to pain being felt, the brain by itself cannot feel pain but if there was some leakage of blood in to the brain coverings then irritation of nerve endings might happen. This does not happen in every patient and when it happens, there is restlessness in the patient. If your mom did not show any signs of restlessness then there was no pain that she possibly had. The brain was supporting itself and in 3 days there was deterioration of the other organ functions leading to her demise. May her soul rest in peace."},{"Patient":"Last week I had a strong electrical tingling sensation in my mid chest. Lasted only a few seconds, but was sharp.

It has continued for a couple of hours, but mild so far. Not as intense as the initial chest sensation.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The nerves to the arms and chest originate from the spinal cord in the cervical and thoracic spine. The cervical spine is made up of 7 small bones aligned on top of each other and the thoracic spine has 12 bones lined up together. There are spongy discs between these small bones which give it a cushioning effect and help in forward backward and turning movements. There is a possibility that your discs at particular levels have been degenerating for some time. Since it has happened over the past week, it is important to rule out any nerve irritation or a condition that has developed recently. The tingling sensation is more frequent when there is pinching of the nerves in the region. Doing a MRI scan of the cervical and thoracic spine might be required. This will be decided after once a your neurological clinical examination is complete. Treatment depends on clinical and imaging findings."},{"Patient":"I recently rolled my right ankle.

These nerves have components originating from nerve roots of different levels which join together to form the nerves. It is possible that there is pinching of nerve roots near the origin or at any location along its route. Since the numbness is more on the middle and ring finger, therefor it is the median nerve that needs assessment. There can be trapping of the nerve at any point in its passage.

What happens is there is a possibility of the blood sugar level going down to sub normal and then this causes decreased glucose metabolism in the brain and other organs. While slight low glucose in blood might be tolerated for a short time, longer durations of hypoglycemia can cause dizziness, weakness, nausea and sweating. It is important to eat well and take adequate amount of nutritious foods rich in vitamins and proteins.

Sugical approach to tumors of pituitary can involve through the skull as in craniotomy or through the nose. The chances of CSF leak are higher in the surgical approach through nose. During surgery for pituitary adenoma, the tumor is approached though the roof of the nose to reach the tumor. This is called trans sphenoidal surgerydone through the nose. Unavoidably, the surgery involves making a small aperture which connects the brain to the roof of nose. This is then sealed and should heal by itself in most patients. In a small group of people, this communication does not heal completely and might persist as a route through which CSF leak occurs.Treatment of a CSF leak is done by surgical repair or in some cases through use of temporary diversion of CSF through a lumbar drain or a ventriculostomy (a catheter placed in the ventricle of the brain).

Mark-- ps: hope this is free-I m broke","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The lower back is made of 5 small bones aligned on top of each other. There are small discs in between these bones. The spinal canal passes at the back through a hole formed by the posterior elements of the bones. On each side between the bones, there are small foramen or holes through which nerves originating from the spinal cord pass through. In your case, one or more discs in the lower back region is displaced and herniated backwards. This can cause pressure on the nerves passing through the foramen and this leads to severe pain. The can can also happen when the disc is in close contact with the spinal cord covering in the spinal canal which is also known as thecal sac.Treatment for thecal sac compression and nerve root compression is first injecting steroids in to the areas of nerve compression. If this does not relieve the pain then the pressure on the spinal canal must be decompressed by surgically removing the laminae which forms the posterior elements of the vertebrae. This is called laminectomy. However,  the extent of pain relief after surgery differs in each case and some patients can still have the pain."},{"Patient":"A friend s son experienced a diabetic coma for a lenghty period before discovery, he now suffers from memory loss for the past six years. Before that is normal...any reading material to look for help??? He is in hospital rehab but the memory thing may be permanent. Prognosis seems negative...but mother wonders what if anything she can do, read, to contribute to his recovery.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Diabetic coma might have affected his long term memory functions severely. Recovery of memory and cognitive functions takes time and the patient requires a lot of support and perseverance from friends and family. It will be nice if he can get himself in to neurological rehabilitation clinics and take intensive lessons to improve his memory and cognitive learning. He can be helped by doing crossword puzzles, reading books, playing word games and using the brain in doing tasks which require teaching concepts newly. He might not be able to get back his old memory but he can be taught cognitive behavior therapy methods to store and process new information in his daily life. He should be taught few things each day and his progress in to be monitored regularly."},{"Patient":"I have headaches that are very painful. I have had an MRA & the doctors have said all is normal. I m on high blood pressure medicine & the doctor added another medication Metropolol for the headaches which seemed to help some, but I still get them sometimes out of the blue but especially when I cough, sneeze or laugh hard. When I feel a cough or a sneeze coming on I get very apprehensive cause I know it will hurt. I ve also had my neck scanned & been told 4 years ago that I needed to have vertebraes removed and/or fused together due to my spinal cord is not totally protected with spinal fluid as it should be & if I have an accident I could become paralyzed. my question is can too much or lack of seritonin or cerebral fluid cause headaches?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The attacks of e during laughing or sneezing is due to the problem with cervical spine vertebrae. There is probably a pressure over the cerebellar tonsils region or spinal cord and this needs to be discussed in detail with your neurosurgeon.Pressure in the brain is called intracranial pressure. This pressure is different from blood pressure but complications due to high blood pressure can cause raised intracranial pressure. The intracranial pressure depends on the flow of cerebrospinal fluid which is surrounding the brain and spinal cord from every side. Increase in intracranial pressure can be due to brain swelling, bleeding within the brain, tumors inside the head and infections causing block of cerebrospinal fluid flow.Metoprolol need not necessarily cause increased intracranial pressure. Please discuss with your neurologist."},{"Patient":"Hello, I have Symptoms and diagnosis that are clinical. Could this be something else? 1. Back fusion surgery with nerve damage in legs/sciatica 2.

It is important to know complete details before giving an opinion on a surgery of the brain. A blood clot in any place within the brain should be observed carefully. The first step is to see that the clot is not growing in size. For this one or more brain scans are required. Then the size of the clot is to be discussed. The location is important because in some places even a small clot can be risky and in other places a moderate sized clot will not be a serious concern. I do not understand completely regarding compression of nerve whether it is one nerve or a particular area. It will help if you can upload scan images and reports to understand the brain compression and clot location completely. Surgery in such cases are risky but if the patient is in a pre coma stage and not responding to commands properly then a surgery can be life saving. If required you can take another opinion by consulting a different neurosurgeon by taking scan reports and discussing the problem."},{"Patient":"My grandson has plexiform neurofibroma in his abdomen! Will it continue to grow if not treated? If he has the NFi gene, can it be treated with meds? If not what kind of treatment is available. The mass in his abdomen also shows it s wrapped around major arteries! What now?","Doctor":"hi,Thanks for writing in.Plexiform neurofibromas in strategic locations are to be removed through skilled surgery. It is important to know the size and extension of the tumor and if there are any cancerous areas which are developing within. In that case,  you must consult an oncosurgeon and vascular surgeon and know the implications of the tumor causing pressure effects or the rare possibility of the tumor infiltrating the arteries. Medicines are not a treatment option for these tumors. Though the tumors are usually benign and harmless, increase in size with time and malignant transformation cannot be entirely ruled out in your grandson. That might take years to happen but it can be easily prevented by getting treated through surgery at present."},{"Patient":"My husband had distal bicep surgery recently and by now should have returned function in his wrist and fingers. He does not- instead he has wrist drop . If surgery is required to fix this,presumably his radial nerve. How long is general is recovery? If surgery is not required and it is just a stretched or bruised never as a result of surgery- how long is recovery generally? Also. how often does this happen to patients? is it common?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It i important to know the exact location and reason for wrist drop. Recovery might be slow and take weeks to months in some people. Supportive measures such as analgesics, steroids and anti convulsants should be given for weeks to months. Physical therapy is also important to avoid long term complications in mobility of the affected wrist. The main concern is to prevent complications arising out of wrist drop like deformity, loss of sensations and inability to perform movements. Medical causes such as diabetes and kidney disease should be treated. Nerve regeneration medications also cause early healing. Patients require at least 12 weeks or more to feel better in most situations of wrist drop under treatment."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am a 70 yr old woman diagnosed with venous lakes by one Dr andHeamangiomas in skull by another (lytic lesions). Is there a difference between these ? Also 15 yrs ago one was 1.2 in size now 1.7.. is there any risk to be aware of? Also as I have many cysts in liver, kidney, and other places could these be these related? Also is there anything else I should be aware of?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Hemangiomas are a focus of blood vessels under the skin, bones or other organs. Venous lakes are a focus of blood vessels specifically due to enlargement of a surrounding vein. So there is really not much difference between a hemangioma and venous lake when considering treatment options but hemangioma if involving the underlying bone then the area of involvement requires to be assessed. In other words there are technically two different entities with similar origins and appearances and treatment options. These are slow growing and not a concern unless it is a one of the larger ones that you have.The cysts in liver and kidneys are expected at your age and not a concern. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"My daughter has been complaining about her legs and arms shaking constantly for the past 2 weeks. We had all the blood work done, and everything is completely normal. With this, she has been having chronic headaches for a few months. A recent MRI had shown she has a cyst in her sinus, which they feel is causing the headaches. However, they are still clueless about the shaking. Any thoughts?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Legs and arms shaking for 2 weeks is not related to sinus problems including cysts in the sinus. If MRI scan brain is normal then a screening MRI scan of the spine might be done to know if there is any problem in the spinal canal that can be causing this. Sometimes patients get shaking hands and legs even due to partial seizures and this should be evaluated by doing a electroencephalography which will map any abnormal electrical activities in the brain responsible for her symptoms.The sinuses are air spaces in the face where the air gets conditioned to the body temperature and humidity before entering the lungs. A cyst in the sinus is a benign finding and can cause headaches which are positional and more after bending forwards. Any fluid collection or cysts in the sinuses can explain the chronic headaches."},{"Patient":"I am awaiting a GP appointment to interpret the following MRI scan results, but would appreciate a translation/interpretation if possible; encephalomalacia anteriorly in the inferior aspect of both frontal lobes adjacent to the midline with resultant expansion of the overlying csf space and some high signal change in the underlying subcortial white matter. there is no mass effect or evidence of restricted diffusion. appearance elsewhere are unremarkable. presumably these are a sequelae of the previous head injury and results of bilateral frontal contusions. The previous head injury referred to was over 40yrs ago and has had no impact (that I am aware of! lol) on my mental or physical functioning.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.You might be one of the lucky few who had a serious head injury at a younger age and have recovered without any residual symptoms. Encephalomalacia means softening of the brain. This happens when there is injury to the brain and absent blood supply and consequently resulting in loss of brain matter and cerebrospinal fluid occupies the area after the shrinkage of that part of the brain. Since it has happened more than 40 years ago and you might have been much younger at that time, the brain circuits that were damaged were realigned and your affected brain was compensated for its loss in functions. At a young age the brain learns to cope up with its limitations in a better way. This is called neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity allows the neurons (nerve cells) in the brain to compensate for injury and disease and to adjust their activities in response to new situations or to changes in their environment. Therefore you have been normal throughout your life."},{"Patient":"I had umbilical surgery repair several months ago. it reacurred about eight weeks after the surgery. my Dr did not use mesh.

I was not looked upon for the next 55 minutes. I was found 55 minutes later with a Oxygen level of 66%, bluish in color and not responsive. A code was called and I was given Narcan to arouse me. My question is what effects did this prolonged decreased oxygen level have on my body, (brain, organs etc)?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The temporary effects of mild hypoxia or decreased levels of oxygen are1. temporary memory loss2. reduced ability to move your body3. difficulty paying attention4. difficulty making sound decisionsSince you has oxygen saturation of 66 percent after surgery due to anesthesia, there would be mild hypoxia only at that time. There will not be any long term side effects of the situation.The memory problems, inability to move body, attention related difficulties and inability to make sound decisions are present only for the duration of hypoxia and are corrected when the oxygen saturation rises and there is no risk of any long term adverse consequences due to the incident.

I have been having so many problems with my back and throughout my whole body ever since. I was treated with PT, narcotics, injections, exercises, OTC medicines. I starting detoxing off all pain medications and prescriptions June 27, 2014. I could feel my body getting worse. I am having burning up and down my spine that radiated every where. My lungs were on fire and chest pain with inflammation. I had fluid building up through out my body, basal temp is 96.5. I have to constantly battle to get it up to 97.5 and above to keep my kidneys working. I have continual spasms of all my organs, eyes, throat, back and chest, legs. My spine feels like it is on fire. All labs come back normal, including T3 and T4 and TSH. My tongue is huge, my face swells at will, I have stiffness in my legs and back. I have increasing low back and leg weakness. My legs go completely numb, tingling, cold from the knees down. I think its the hardware or the donor bone. I have multiple chemical sensitivity to alcohol, alcohol by-products or medical products that alcohol is used to process it. Also any medications or medical implants that may be enteric coated. I think those little bone chip things might have been! It feels like my body is attacking itself. I had an appt with an allergist/immunologist oct 1, 2014. He didn t do any tests just took my medical information and promised to contact me. No return call. I called him twice. I afraid I am going to lose my ability to walk before I can get help. The I have to go to the ER for temporary paralysis, hypertensive crisis, and allergic for shortness of breath due to the severity of the spasms. My eye doctor put me on Prednisone 20 mg for the inflammation in my eyes and fluid build up, another doctor gave me Clonidine 0.1mg to manage the hypertensive episodes from the continual spasms. Medications that would normally be used to treat spasms my body reacts with increased spasms and hypertension with syncope. Crazy. This has been going on since July 24, 2014 after all the narcotics and prescription drugs were out of my system. Will an MRI give better detail what s going on in my back? When you see the image of the hardware on the CT Scan part of the metal has a bent gap and crooked and is glowing white. I know it s a lot of stuff to hear. I am living with it. I am 98% home-bound. My legs are too weak to control. I can t drive any more.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.MRI is an investigation of choice to study the spinal cord, intervertebral discs and nerves. It is important that you confirm that the metal hardware is MRI compatible. This is because the MRI machine is a huge magnet and if the hardware is not MRI compatible then you might have serious injury during MRI scan. This happens when there is ferromegnetic properties in the metal which will attract the hardware. This might cause the hardware to get pulled from its fixed location and cause injury to surrounding structures.  It is also possible that you have a MRI compatible hardware and if this holds good then there is no need to worry for any problems in MRI scan. Then your MRI imaging will be safe and the causes for your pain and discomfort can be evaluated in more detail than a CT scan."},{"Patient":"I have had a migraine/headache for over a week straight. I suffer from them & have tried numerous preventatives which I thought were working. I cannot lay on my stomach & lift my head up without pressure. My speech hasn t been 100% lately. I mix up my words, say one thing but mean another & often times I have to stop & start over. I ve always been an awful speller but lately I cannot even sound words out properly to type them and its frustrating. About a year ago I had an MRI done which showed a lesion in the white matter of my frontal lobe. My nuerologist said it was normal. I m concerned that there is more to it. I keep giving my old phone number & zip code when asked & its been a good 5 years or more since those have changed. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.White matter lesions in frontal lobe are seen in many people in the elderly age group. Since your age is not mentioned, I guess you are in your middle age or elderly. The frontal lobes are most severely affected by sub cortical vascular ischemia. In this there is reduced blood supply in the specific areas of the brain and these are more abundant in the frontal region. It is not a serious finding and your doctor might have considered it as a part of normal aging changes in your brain and therefore mentioned it as normal.Such findings have been associated with frontal hypometabolism and executive dysfunction. There is reduced nutrition to these parts with decreased cognitive functions and probably speech at times. The memory problem relating to saying your old zip code shows that you have an intact long term memory but your recent memory is affected at times.

Main drugs of choice includes glucocorticoids, aspirin, and hydroxychloroquine. Glucocorticoids are one of the primary medications for neuropsychiatric lupus. If any patient develops thrombosis with the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies would indicate the need for anticoagulation. Simpler medicines like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for symptomatic relief are given, specific treatment include anticoagulation for thrombotic diseases and immunosuppressives for inflammation such as cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and methotrexate.

When it happens, the blood flowing through the vessels from heart to brain might have a reduced flow. These are by the carotid and vertebral arteries on either sides. This is more significant when you are standing upright and doing any moderate to heavy physical activity.Since he has got scans for inner ear and brain done, it is confirmed that there is no abnormality in the vestibular system in the ear or any serious conditions in the brain.Since his CT scan or MRI scan brain is normal, it can help if he gets Electronystagmography (ENG) or videonystagmography (VNG) done to record abnormal eye movements while the head is placed in different positions or your balance organs are stimulated with water or air. For this he might consult the ENT specialist.The best way to analyze if the reduced blood flow to the brain is causing your dizziness is by doing a carotid and vertebral arteries Doppler ultrasound. It will show the flow of blood from the heart to the brain and if it is adequate.Dizziness can also occur due to stress related anxiety or overflow of emotions."},{"Patient":"Yesterday my 61 yr old sister had itching on her scalp on the left side and later in the day a small bump appeared and in this morning she woke up with a terrible headache and there was a large lump on the side of her head.

The lump has gone down some and her headache is better. So what is the lump from I never heard of a migraine with a lump on the head. They told her it was on the outside of the skull.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.From the description of the lump on the head, it appears that it might be a scalp swelling, There are many kinds of swelling involving the head and scalp. Some of these remain inactive for a long time and then get infected and become enlarged in size with development of pain. These are commonly cysts like sebaceous cysts and can have a central opening when looked at closely. If doctors at ER have examined your sister then it is certainly not a tumor that is growing from within. As lump has gone down after taking keflex therefore there is an infection that is now under control. Migraine cannot be the result of a lump and cannot cause one. Migraine is a different medical entity and not related to the lump."},{"Patient":"I had blackout on MDMA and alcohol. Can t remember anything after getting kicked out of club but girlfriend said i acted like kid n got home safely - amazing but scary. Was it too much alcohol? I probable had 7-8 drinks in 5 hours before dropping mdma","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Blackouts can happen due to high levels of alcohol in your system. Since you also had MDMA therefore the action of alcohol is more potentiated and you might have had certain brain dysregulations and then alcohol switches off some of the cognitive functions in the brain. These symptoms are more in some people and you should be careful the next time you are drinking heavily.When the alcohol levels rise in blood and the same reaches the brain, then the encoding function of the brain gets temporarily affected. The person can no longer remember things happening around and is unaware and disoriented. This is what happened to you. When alcohol levels in blood decreases, the encoding areas start functioning again and the patient comes back to normal. However there is no memory for past events that happened soon after drinking heavily or taking drugs the previous night."},{"Patient":"I have been suffering from Disc problem from last 5 years.

You seem to be having one of the discs protruding between the bones and this protrusion is backwards and causing narrowing of the spinal canal. You are having these discs protruding in to the spinal canal at more than one level and causing pinching of nerve roots leading to severe pain in your back and legs.There are patients who get relief by doing physiotherapy and taking neurogenic pain relievers. Injections give relief as you have experienced earlier. However this might nor always happen. If your pain is severe and not responding to medical treatment then the disc protrusion needs to be removed by doing a small surgery at the lower back region.

Some of the symptoms that lead to the test include, severe dizziness--2 mos; numbness on the right side of my face--2 mos; poor word recall; severe fatigue; and a general feeling of fogginess. Here are the MRI results: EXAMINATION: MRI Brain without contrast. CLINICAL HISTORY: Right-sided facial numbness COMPARISON: CT head dated 7/24/2014 TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence MR imaging of the brain without intravenous contrast was acquired. FINDINGS: The ventricles are of normal size, shape, and contour for the patient s age. There are several (approximately 6-7) scattered punctate foci of T2 FLAIR hyperintensity involving the periventricular and subcortical white matter. The largest is a periventricular focus in the left frontal lobe measuring approximately 4 mm in diameter (axial FLAIR image 22). These foci are nonspecific, and slightly greater than expected for the patient s age. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, or hydrocephalus. There is no mass effect or midline shift. Diffusion weighted imaging reveals no diffusion restriction to suggest acute infarction. The visualized skull base and calvarium demonstrate no significant abnormality. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of an acute intracranial process. 2. Scattered punctate foci of T2 FLAIR hyperintensity involving the periventricular and subcortical white matter. This is a nonspecific finding that can be seen in the setting of chronic microangiopathic change, migraines, demyelinating disease, and various other inflammatory/infectious etiologies.

The largest is a periventricular focus in the left frontal lobe measuring approximately 4 mm in diameter (axial FLAIR image 22). These foci are nonspecific, and slightly greater than expected for the patient s age.This shows possible small vessel disease. It is expected in the elderly age group but there is a mention that having 6 to 7 such lesions is slightly more than usual. These findings can occur earlier in hypertension and diabetes and if you do not have these conditions, other disease involving cerebral vasculature must be thought of.2. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, or hydrocephalus. There is no mass effect or midline shift. Diffusion weighted imaging reveals no diffusion restriction to suggest acute infarction. The visualized skull base and calvarium demonstrate no significant abnormality.This details that there is no sign of acute stroke like episode and the findings are more of a non stroke origin.In conclusion, the above findings are indicative of microangiopathic changes in small vessels in brain. These are non specific and can cause symptoms like migraines, vertigo and slight fogginess related problems. A repeat MRI scan brain might be required in 6 months to a year if there is sudden progressive symptoms from the ones you are having.

In many patients the cord remains tethered even after doctors have tried to release the cord by one or more surgical sessions. It is important that the surgical procedures include careful intradural dissection and meticulous wound and dural closure.

Numbers are difficult to be precise on since so many variables come into play when discussing the genetics of this disease within a family.  However, has everyone in the family been screened for certain diseases that are known to manifest with aortic types of aneurysms such as Elhers-Danlos, Marfans, and other connective tissue disease problems?

ALS is progressive loss of anterior horn cells. The involvement of bilateral arms without other limb involvement occurs in man in barrel syndrome like variant. Other possibilities may be cervical cord lesion probably syrinx or some rare limb girdle muscular dystrophy or bilateral brachial plexopathy.

This usually happens late at night, when I m in bed, and it wakes me up, and then does not go away. I am Type II diabetic, non-insulin dependent, hypertensive, with ESRD and on dialysis.","Doctor":"Abnormal sensation in your feet may be related to your comorbid conditions of diabetes and renal dysfunction. Most likely you may be having neuropathy and require nerve conduction study for proper evaluation. Some pain modulation may help you.

I have been through your question and understand your concern.Urinary retention can be secondary to UTI so you should first treat appropriately it. Then you should have a neurological examination to better define what type of sensory or weakness abnormaity you have and if it is associated to L5-S1 radiologic abnormalities. Then a nerve conduction study of the nerves would help.After all this a more accurate conclusion can be set.Hope this helps.

I have been through you question and understand your concern.Vertigo can be central or peripheral with the second option being a benign situation and generally lasts from 2 to 6 weeks. It can be intermittent but you should be symptom free for a period of time to be called peripheral. There are some other situation where vertigo is persisting but it should be associated with tinitus (noise inside the ear) and hypoacusia. The central nervous system involvement as well has different objective features like weakness or numbness of the face, difficulties swallowing or talking or even more moving.Since it is persisting for such a long time it is mandatory to have a neurological consult to have you have a neurological objective examination to see if it is a real vertigo or unsteadiness or both, with the later involving other neurological structures such as the posterior columns.Once you have this consultation it will more clear about your situation.Do not hesitate on scheduling a neurological consult.Hope this helps.

I have been through your question and understand your concern.It seems you had an old infarct which somehow reorganised into an epileptogenic focus which produces seizures. It is a common eventuality after stroke. Generally this is a benign situation. You just need to prevent further seizures with the appropriate anti epileptic drugs (Depakote is what I recommend)Yet you should have several heart test (ECG, Esophageal echocardiogram) hypercoagulability blood test, Doppler of the carotid arteries and neck-head MRI to find what caused you the first stroke to prevent a second one.Hope this helps.

The surgeon found torn tissue wrapped around my spine and it was leaking fluid. I had been having headaches. I have been having muscle spasms in both legs and pain. There has been numbness in my feet and burning sensation. This has been going on for three months. The surgeon had a Nerve Conduction Study done and the results are Peripheral Neuropathy and Sural Nerve damage. He told me no physical therapy which I don t understand why not. I m going to ask him. What do you recommend? Thank you! I m hoping to make an appointment with a neurosurgeon or Neurologist.","Doctor":"Hello. I have been through your question and understand your concern.It is a bit unusual to report these problems after a spinal stenosis surgery. Anyway, at this point you have peripheral neuropathy which is mainly seen in diabetes and probably you had it before surgery. Another cause is intoxication generally by drugs. In this case gabapentine and amitryptilline would help a lot on nerve repair and relief from numbness. While sural nerve damage can cause burning sensation but other than that it is not very concerning because it is a sensory nerve and does not causes weakness or major problems. As for the burning sensation gabapentin and amitryptilline are recommended.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"hello Doctor !

Just my right hand and wrist were shaking but it startled me. Soon after I had soreness in my right hand, my whole body felt jittery, pain in my chest and headache. Today my hand and wrist are sore, slight pain in chest, and headache. Nothing to worry about or should I go to a doctor?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Electrocution is an injury that is due to passage of current through the body. The electricity can take the shortest route through the body and in to the earth. This has happened in your case as the current has taken the route through the right hand and probably the right side of the body. While it might be a minor shock and you seem to be doing fine, since you are having chest discomfort therefore it will help to do a ECG if required. This is because electrocution can interfere with the normal low voltage current flowing through the heart and cause change in rhythmicity. The other concern will be any changes in color of urine due to increased protein destruction in the muscles involved by electrocution. Essentially there is nothing to worry about if you do not experience changes in heart rate of urine formation."},{"Patient":"Hello, I ve had a pain in my right back side above kidneys, closer to spine for about two years now. It feels like muscle pain, except sometimes I an actually feel the knots and its not something that goes away after a massage. Should I be getting an MRI or full body catscan?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.A pain in the right upper back can be due to many causes including those involving the spine. The correct approach is to get examined by your doctors and doing a ultrasound scan. The pain from stones in kidneys and gall bladder can be felt in the right upper back. Since you have the pain for 2 years it is important to rule out renal stones, gall bladder stones or anything to do with the liver. This is because the nerves supplying these areas can cause referred pain in the back. If the ultrasound report is not contributory then doing a X ray might be required followed by MRI if indicated after examination of the back clinically done by your doctors. If there is problem with your nerves then MRI scan will help. CAT scan helps only if there is a possible bone abnormality. Whole body scan is not required in every person and only the clinically suspected area is to be scanned."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor,My name is Tania.

Thank you","Doctor":"Hi.A good question. It is better to have an enema a day prior to the surgery to evacuate the lower bowels as it helps surgery.Taking or not taking water has nothing to do with the infection.Water and anything is stopped 8 hours before surgery as one may need a general anesthesia and stomach has to be empty."},{"Patient":"Hi I been having trouble rembering things an my head been feeling dizzy an light headed my eyes also feel heavy ur sensitive at times. Been having water come out my nose when u bend over an neck pains what should I do. Do I have a brain tumor anything?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Most of the symptoms in the head are due to anxiety related stress or also related to sinus infections and old injuries. These are combined with physical symptoms and therefore can cause water through the nose and heaviness or pains in the neck. At the same time, such symptoms can also be due to problems in the head and neck region. It is important to get yourself examined neurologically. This will differentiate any symptoms which are due to intracranial causes and those due to problems in neck and paranasal air sinuses. If required a CT scan or MRI scan of brain might be required and tumors having symptoms as reported by you are considerably rare. Please do not worry and reduce any stress situations."},{"Patient":"My father had two gran mal seizures yesterday, he had ischemic stroke five months ago. His first seizure was back in August. Now, he has a headache that goes away with Tylenol and feels a little dizzy. Can headaches occur after seizures? Orherwise, he speaks, walks okay, no numbness anywhere. He started Keppra today","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern.Seizure are a possible complication of stroke like it seems to be your father's case. It can happen after a generalized seizure to have some temporary headache and dizziness, if you don't notice any other change in his alertness level, behavior and movement I don't think a stroke recurrence must be feared.Keppra is a good treatment choice with good efficacy and few side effects compared to other antiepileptics.I hope things work out for the best."},{"Patient":"Hello, I have had shingles since April 2, 2014. I have no leasions, but the pain and stinging is just awful. It goes from my left arm to my armpit and over my breast. Also my back.

Will there be a problem with the gabapatin?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Post herpetic neuralgia or pain after shingles is a known entity and distressful to the patient. The recommended treatment for pain after shingle is Lidocaine skin patchesCapsaicin skin patchesAnticonvulsantsAntidepressantsOpioid painkillersYour doctor has given gabapentin which is an anticonvulsant to help control burning and pain. Side effects of these drugs include drowsiness, unclear thinking, unsteadiness and swelling in the feet. However these are temporary and will stop after you discontinue taking the medications. There is another medication called pregabalin and this is also an anticonvulsant.Please do not worry about any long term problems due to medications. Treatment might still take sometime in your case."},{"Patient":"A brain MRI finding is in part: The ventricles, cisterns, and other CSF containing spaces are diffusely prominent secondary to parenchymal volume loss. This is stable. There are confluent periventricular and patchy subcortical foci of increased signal on T2/FLAIR sequences consistent with gliosis secondary to chronic small vessel ischemic disease. These are stable. 1. What does this mean? 2. I am 85 years old, and about three months ago experienced an acute brain allergic reaction to a medication I was given. At that time, for about three weeks, I was confused and felt demented. Since then, I have largely recovered but feel some mild persisting reduction in intellectual functioning. My wife and I are considering moving from our present large single-family home to a senior-living community. Should we, considering the MRI findings, give preference to facilities equipped to deal with mental decline? If so, how much?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The MRI scan brain is as explained below.Brain shows changes due to aging and this has been written are prominent ventricles and cisterns and also reduce brain volume. This is not a serious condition and is an expected finding in the elderly. Confluent periventricular T2 and FLAIR increased signal intensities is due to partial effects of decreased blood flow through the small arteries in the brain. This is nothing serious and can be seen in many people. This happens earlier in those having diabetes and hypertension. The acute brain allergic reaction is not responsible for all your finding in the brain. There is no requirement to seek additional facilities to deal with mental decline if you have made a near complete recovery from the confused and demented state you have had previously. Since you are 85 years old, a little amount of brain volume loss and ischemic small vessel changes are in line and not a big concern if thinking of moving to a community facility for elderly."},{"Patient":"Hi I fell fully forward onto my hands/wrists about 10 weeks ago. Xray shows no fracture of my right wrist (the left is fine) but it it painfull to use, especially in a twisting action ie. open a lid of a jar etc. 4 weeks ago the tip of my thumb (outer aspect only) went numb suddenly and is still numb now. My GP said it will just go away by itself but i am worried it might be nerve damage? Do I need to see a physio?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The hand and wrist is supplied by radial and ulnar nerves which originate from nerves in the neck. There are possibilities of the nerves supplying your hand getting pinched some where in their path causing pain and distress. If you never had a fracture then there is no significant injury to bones. However the injury to nerves cannot be ruled out without proper clinical examination. Also when doing a twisting action, there is complex movement at the wrist joint and that can cause pain because of ligaments getting stretched. It is best you see a neurologist and then check with your physiotherapist. Seeing a neurologist is more important because the tip of your thumb remains numb even after 4 weeks. A test like electromyography  and nerve muscle conduction might be required after clinical assessment."},{"Patient":"I have MS, still playing tennis, twice a week, generally not been bad shape since my fist diagnosis for MS 10 years ago.

It comes and goes but when it flares up I get really dizzy also at that time it only last about 2-3 seconds then it all back to normal MS ?Don t know if it could be heart or just my MS getting finally worse, don t know who I should see?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.One of the most common sensory problems associated with MS is numbness. Numbness occurs when the nerves that transmit sensations do not conduct information properly. As a result, sensations in that particular area are either lacking or nonexistent. Since you are having an active life and still playing tennis twice a week therefore you must get yourself clinically examined and if required a MRI scan. This is necessary as it can pick up any new areas should there be MS specific changes in your brain. Seeing a neurologist is essential at the moment. Please describe completely the symptoms and severity experienced by you."},{"Patient":"Hello Dr. Grief, I may have an imbalance issue or perhaps vertigo. problem directs itself to my ears which when checked last couple of days appears to have no wax or infections. do feel like the room turns sometimes, and have checked my blood pressure - all normal. but do have a low blood sugar and have to eat frequent small portions hope you can provide some guidance here?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Low blood sugar means the amount of sugar level in your blood is below normal. The brain and other organs in the body require sugar for metabolism and proper functioning. If the sugar levels go below normal then there is compromise in the functioning of the organs. The brain consumes a good amount of sugars in blood as its requirement. If it does not get this nutrient then there will be delay or sluggish functioning in the brain. This is known as hypoglycemia. When the brain function is below normal at that time a person starts getting warning signals in the form of dizziness and vertigo."},{"Patient":"hello ...when i wake up in the middle of the night or first thing in the morning i am very dizzy i feel like i am drunk and sometimes i have to go back to bed to see if it will pass. I get very tired and nausea . This has happened alot to me . what causes this?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Its possible you have benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Benign positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of vertigo. This is intense dizziness due after getting up from bed. It is important that you consult an ENT specialist and confirm if you have this condition. This happens when there are specific changes in the position of your head, such as tipping your head up or down, and by lying down, turning over or sitting up in bed. You may also feel out of balance when standing or walking. The doctors will do some tests to examine your inner ear and balance mechanism.

The spine is a delicate part of the body and any mass over there can cause pressure on the structures within the spinal cord or adjacent to it. There are many nerves in the area and pinching of nerves can cause significant pain in particular positions. Since it is not a cancer, still attempts are to be made towards decompression of the mass at its location. Till such time that surgical treatment is decided upon, he can be given prescription strong pain killers in the form of skin patches to reduce the severe pain when it happens."},{"Patient":"I have had seizures in the past and they were due to a dead spot of brain tissue a good size too about 1/10 of the brain that never developed and was removed and I have a few seizures a year now compared to a doz a day because of another undeveloped spot deep in the brain and doctors don t want to mess with and I was wondering if since i chew tobacco occasionally if it effects seizures at all and how bad","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern.Chewing tobacco does not affect your seizures, they are related to that lesion in your brain and tobacco doesn't bear any additional influence in their development.You might want to consider quitting tobacco chewing anyway though as it has other negative effects predisposing you to cancer of the oral cavity, esophagus, stomach, nicotine addiction, and other local damages to oral cavity.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"My left lower side of my stomach feels swollen and tight across from my belly button, when I push down there is pain and I feel like I m going to vomit, my heads hot and headaches and my throat is swollen and makes it hard to swallow..

Such infections are not common but should it happen then it needs to be treated at the earliest. Please take over the counter medication for fever like tylenol and then wait for about 4 to 6 hours to see for any improvements. If your doctors have given a course of antibiotics then please take it. You also need to eat well and take rest.

The doctor put him back on a statin drug this time pravastin he was on it for a couple of days and after seeing a neurologist he decided to stop taking it.

They have similar mechanism of action and side effects, actually atorvastatin may be the most used and well known statin worldwide.I understand that the lack of explanation must be confusing to you. There is still not a clearly explained mechanism or cause for transient global amnesia, several theories like migraine variant, seizure, transient ischemic attack. None of those would have any relation to statins though, if anything statins should have a beneficial effect in case transient ischemia is the cause.

This can mean that the posture while typing is not correct or your computer and eyes are not aligned at the same level. It might also be that you do not blink your eyes frequently or are not breathing normally when sitting at the computer. Please take regular breaks and drink adequate fluids when at work. This will also prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.

Is this a memory problem or another disorder","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Memory is the function of a group of brain centers and this is known as a higher mental function. Seizures happen due to bursts of electric current within the brain. Any seizure patient must be investigated in detail. This includes full neurological clinical examination and psychological assessment. You need to take tests to evaluate your recent, short term and long term memories. Since you have said that the past cannot be recalled easily, it might be due to long term memory problems. You also need electroencephalography and functional MRI scan to know exactly which part of your brain is involved when asking questions on memory. These studies should be done in a research institute where facilities are available."},{"Patient":"I can only describe my symptom as electric shock or lightening strike down the side of my neck.

I only heard Don t worry about it.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The nerves to the neck originate from the cervical spine. The cervical spine is made up of 7 small bones aligned on top of each other. There are spongy discs between these small bones which give it a cushioning effect and help in forward backward and turning movements. There is a possibility that your discs at particular levels have been degenerating for some time. The symptoms first noted 35 years back indicate a benign condition and over the years the disc problems might have worsened. The tingling sensation is more frequent when there is pinching of the nerves in the region. Doing a MRI scan of the region might be required. Treatment depends of findings."},{"Patient":"Hi, I went to a neurologist and she recommended MRI. Everything normal except for partial empty sella and patency of the major intracranial blood vessels.

MRI normal except for Thornwaldt Cyst. Have had multiple(6 or 7) falls with head injury, including loss of consciousness and brain injury. Possible basal skull fracture(Battles Sign) in 2010 due to fall. Falls have generally been preceded by sudden onset of drop in BP and full rotational vertigo. I am frightened of another fall/brain injury. I do not believe I can survive another head strike. I am currently taking Lamictal and Lyrica. Benefits of Rx has been marginal, at best. Many thanks!","Doctor":"I read your question and I understand your concern. However regarding what you are asking specifically about, Thornwaldt cyst, no, that shouldn't be the cause of the loss of consciousness. They are outside of the brain, in the posterior part of your nasal-oral cavity and almost never cause symptoms.They could become symptomatic if they become infected with nasal discharge and bad breath. Another possibility is favoring middle ear infections, but that apart from being detectable on MRI would have presented other signs well before thinking of some brain involvement.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"I have lupus and R/a with a history of cancer, uterine that came back vaginally. I just got back MRI results and it shows mild marrow heterogeneity. Fatty marrow reconversion versus hemangiomas are present within the L1 and L2 vertebral bodies. Moderate degenerative endplate changes are present at the L2-L3 level. Disc desiccation is most pronounced between L2 and L where there is mild disc space narrowing. What does this mean and should I worry about the marrow heterogeneity with my history of cancer?","Doctor":"I read your query and considering your history of cancer I completely understand your concern.How ever that term shouldn't worry you much, at least not related to your history of cancer. Marrow heterogeneity is often found because the marrow undergoes changes with age and according to blood production needs. As these changes happen changes also the components making for the presence of red marrow active in hematopoiesis (production of blood elements) and yellow marrow which is not active and is called that due to a higher concentration of fat. As we grow older there's more yellow marrow, more fat, and the combination of these red and yellow areas makes for different signals on MRI hence the heterogeneity.The rest of the exam speaks of degenerative changes of the spine, they are to be expected with age, so their significance depends on your age and symptoms.Hemangiomas are also a common finding, often incidentally detected as usually they cause no symptoms and need no treatment.I hope to have been of help"},{"Patient":"Sir, i am 32yrs old,my height is 5 7 and weight is 50kg i have left side spinal sacralisation.

They might need surgical realignment if there is displacement. The eroded disc needs to be treated depending on imaging findings. Sorry to hear about the pain. You should follow instructions as per your treating doctors. You might need duragesic dose adjustment and this should be done in discussion with your doctors.

Now at age 38 he doesn t use but can his right hand. He just recently went to the doctor an they diagnosed him with having MS. However then sent him to a neurologist an he diagnosed him with Corticobasal ganglion degeneration I feel like he had a stroke an it went undiagnosed.","Doctor":"I read your question and I understand your concern.To be honest I am very puzzled by your story, especially the corticobasal ganglion degeneration (CBG) part. CBG typically presents around the age of 60. The youngest ever documented case has manifested at the age of 34 (I rechecked before answering just to be sure). So if your son had that disease at 38 with manifestations starting at 35, he would be an almost unique case in the history of the disease, I would be really careful in taking that diagnosis.As for the distinction between MS and stroke related to the head trauma it should generally be easy with an MRI if history and examination do not already make that distinction. Without knowing more about the signs and MRI report it's hard for me to say something more because these diseases can have many different presentations. The seizure would direct more towards the head trauma rather than MS, as would the fact that the deficit has remained constant in time since the hit, without new signs, as you seem to suggest, but as I said MRI and more details are needed.I hope things work out for the best."},{"Patient":"IMPRESSION: I had an MRI and they found this:  Mild punctate FLAIR hyperintensities are demonstrated in the corona radiata and semiovale without evidence of mass effect, abnormal diffusion signal, or evidence of hemorrhagic contusion. These findings are nonspecific and may indicate entities such as demyelinating disease, vasculitis, migraine, or host of other entities including small vessel disease. If indicated, recommend MRI scan of the brain with and without for evaluation of possible activity.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Your MRI scan shows that there are small white spots on MRI in the white matter which is described as multiple punctate FLAIR hyperintensities. This same feature can be seen in many conditions of the brain. There can be destruction of the nerve sheaths which is called as demyelination. There can also be inflammation of the blood vessels supplying the brain and this is called as vasculitis. Similar picture is also seen in migraines which cause headaches. High blood pressure and diabetes can also present with these features at an elderly age. Your age is not provided and your symptoms also are not known. The above conditions have to be considered with complete neurological clinical examination. You should discuss the probabilities with your neurologist to know the exact significance of these findings on MRI scan."},{"Patient":"Hello, My neurologist put me on Propranolol . I have pressure in my brain for two weeks. I feel every day . Some times gets very bad. I had CT scan done. It was normal. My blood pressure is normal 115/75 and pulse is 65 . I m afraid to take the drug because I could get low blood pressure and heart rate.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Pressure in the brain is called intracranial pressure. This pressure is different from blood pressure but complications due to high blood pressure can cause raised intracranial pressure. The intracranial pressure depends on the flow of cerebrospinal fluid which is surrounding the brain and spinal cord from every side. Increase in intracranial pressure can be due to brain swelling, bleeding within the brain, tumors inside the head and infections causing block of cerebrospinal fluid flow.Propranolol need not necessarily cause increased intracranial pressure. Please discuss with your neurologist."},{"Patient":"Please write your question hereDoc s I dnt noe who will see dis msg!? But I want serious help here! I dnt know wat problems ma friend has!

Head injury with multiple clots inside is a serious condition and it is important to know the exact sequence of events in her rehabilitation. People with clots in the brain require close monitoring and specialist care by a neurological team. Naxdom contains naproxen and is a good pain reliever. She needs to be assessed and the episodes of headache are to be studied in details. If there is any situation that increases her headaches then that must be avoided.

Due to sudden movements you might have hurt your neck. This is where the nerves supplying hand and wrist originate. It is usual for a person not to start having more pain a day after a minor traumatic incident. The muscles go into spasm maximum a day after the injury. This is due to release of small amounts of neural transmitters which cause the pain. You are having the pain more on the second day for this reason. This should improve over a week after applying ointments containing pain relievers and muscle relaxants. A X ray of cervical spine might help to confirm that your spine is normal and not a concern."},{"Patient":"My father s MRI detail are Age =45 Observation: 1.Loss of lumber lordosis is noted 2.No other remarkable vertebral abnormality is seen 3.Neural foramina and facet joints are normal 4.Sagittal diameter of bony spinal canal measures as follow L1=14mm,L2-13mm,L3=12mm,L4=12mm,L5=12mm. 5.

In a case of nose bleed the first reason to exclude would be very high blood pressure (which could have occipital headache mistakeable for occipital neuralgia). So if it happens again try to measure your blood pressure. Other possible reason could be fragile or some abnormal nasal blood vessel, nothing to panic but an ENT (ear-nose-throat) specialist visit would be recommended. Of course there are other rarer causes like blood coagulation disorders, certain drugs etc, but they are to be thought only after excluding these common options.Generally isolated nose bleed have benign reasons though, so shouldn't panic for this one time, but if repeated as I said check blood pressure and ENT evaluation.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"Today I experienced a memory loss.

One reason that is possible is nutritional deficiency especially vitamin B12 deficiency. But memory loss is usually not severe. Early stage of dementia may present with forgetfulness of day to day tasks. It may present with impaired registration and recall of short term memory. Usually these symptoms occur in later age. I would advise you to consult a doctor if such symptoms persist and cause impairment in your daily functioning. Medicines like cognitive enhancers or cholinergic drugs are used commonly.

Tonight while out shopping with his wife he got very confused, told her there were people in the car with them and he s been very tired, falling asleep sitting up. Could this be from the lack of oxygen or something else going on.","Doctor":"I read your question and I understand your concern.Confusion and feeling of passing out can be a seizure manifestation. It is not clear whether he had any tests done after his first seizure (from your description a generalized seizure). Seizures in an adult must be investigated after as usually there is a cause behind them. So apart from some routine blood tests he should have examination with MRI to look for brain lesions (tumor, stroke, infection etc) and EEG to search for epileptic activity, location and type. Other exams may be needed at times depending on the physical and imaging exams findings. The fact that he's having these episodes reinforces the need for more exams. Treatment will be directed towards the cause and anti-epileptic treatment if necessary.The lack of oxygen described to you has been suggested as a result of the generalized seizure with temporary breathing interruption, as a secondary sign, not as a cause of the seizure.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"I would like to know what treatments would work successful for a disc pressing up against a nerve I had a xray done and that s what I was told.

Is there any way to prevent /stop this medicine? Regards P.Bhardwaj 0000","Doctor":"I read your question and I understand your concern about your son.Both Carbamazepine (Tegretol) and Valproic acid (Volprin Chrono)are widely used drugs in the treatment of many types of seizures. The choice depends on seizure type and side effects. If I had to blindly pick one of them then I would pick Valproic acid as it is effective in almost all types of seizures, you could rarely go wrong with it. However whether one of those two or another drug (there are many other anti-epileptics) as I said depends on the seizure type. Also it depends on how well controlled your son's seizures currently are with Tegretol, if it's preventing seizures then no reason to switch, otherwise another drug should be tried.As to your last question of whether there is a way to stop taking medicine, epilepsy at times is a lifelong condition.

Even had there been an error it should have been injecting in another disc level, say at l4-l5, while there are no discs from S1 downwards. So perhaps just a typing error.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"I am a 19 year old female and most of the time when I stand up everything is very blurry or feels like I can t see anything for a couple of seconds and I feel dizzy but it all goes away within 3-10 seconds.

Such episodes can happen normally but if frequent and comparison between blood pressure supine and standing shows a drop of over 20 mmHg a diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension. Causes could be many, but at your age inadequate hydration is the main cause.Also some routine tests like blood count, blood sugar, liver and kidney function tests, electrolytes, hormone levels, cardiac check-up should be performed for other causes such as anemia, thyroid disfunction, arrhythmia etc.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"topic on concussions:My son experienced a concussion in 2008 after being bruttaly beaten up and kicked in the head multiple times with heavy boots.

There are a set of 5 small bones aligned one on top of the other and have spongy structures called discs between them. These discs have started bulging and creating pressure on nerve roots on either side and therefore causing back pain.The recommended treatment for bulging discs is as follows(i) Patient is first recommended physiotherapy.(ii) Patient is asked to restrict oneself from doing heavy physical work and lifting more than 10 pounds weight.(iii) Oral over the counter pain relievers might work initially.(iv) Muscle relaxants and pain relievers in ointment form might also help reduce the pain(v) Some patients also show pain relief after taking steroid injections in the disc regions.(vi) If pain increases in severity even after a year of physiotherapy and medications then a surgical approach is recommended.(vii) Laser assisted minimally invasive surgeries are also available"},{"Patient":"For a couple weeks I have had tingling in numbness in my hands and feet also deep muscle aches in my calves but tonight I am having extreme muscle pain in my right outer thigh inhibiting the way I walk.....I have also been dizzy and extremely absent minded as late","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Symptoms including momentary absent mindedness, dizziness and numbness involving hands and feet should not be ignored. These might have a common origin in the brain and can occur due to reduced blood supply in certain areas or any similar abnormality limiting the functions of the brain. It is suggested that you consult your neurologist at the earliest and get your neurology clinical examination done in detail. Depending on your examination findings, your doctor might advise you to get a MRI scan or CT scan done for the brain. This will rule out any possible condition which might cause your symptoms. The above can be considered mini stroke like episodes and you should not wait anymore."},{"Patient":"I had abdominal hernia surgery a week ago.

Yes dear , your symptems are outcome of your Scoliosis and nerve damage. and it is natural  to face such mental and physical hazards  and become irritated &  angry  at triffles  ,as you are undergoing .In fact,Your body is always fighting something -- an infection, a toxin, an allergen, a food or the stress response -- and somehow it redirects its hostile attack on your joints, your brain, your thyroid, your gut, your skin,your kidneys or sometimes your whole body .It weakens your immune system.

This leaves you susceptible to infections.Your immune system is your defense against invaders .But when the immune system becomes weak,due to fauly food habits and deraileled life style , and frequent sufferings , disease cells can grow out of control , the disease overpowers . When disc height is lost, the nerve pathways may become narrowed  and cause Degenerative adult scoliosis and it occurs when the combination of age and deterioration of the spine leads   to the development of a scoliosis curve in the spine and is also often related to osteoporosis  .The lack of space lessens the nerves' supply of blood and oxygen,  which  weakens the bone , making it  more likely to deteriorate and may cause pressure on nerves and possibly even the entire spinal cord. This can lead to: weakness, numbness, and pain in back , the lower extremities. In severe cases, pressure on the spinal cord itself may cause loss of coordination in the muscles of the legs making it difficult to walk normally. The only remedy is suggested to strengthen your immune system .So include essential nutrients in your diet --FIBER RICH , LOW SALT - LOW FAT DIET ,fruit ,green veges ginger , garlic to balance Air factor-- Vayu Dosh -- in our body , vitamins and minerals in natural form -, coconut water , , nuts , almonds , and supplements full of antioxidants as Aloe vera juice + Amla juice 2 spoons , Lemon juice with water and a pinch of salt and black pepper gives immidiate relief .

Severe headache and vomiting preceded by a one sided numbness requires complete investigations including imaging scans like CT scan or MRI scan brain. Sometimes there is what is known as an evolving stroke and this can come with varied symptoms which are often of short duration and improving with time.

I had a brain scan c.t. also a ultra sound done on arterites Dr. says they came out fine. I am still experiencing vertigo every now and again. what do you think my problem is?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.If you get vertigo spells only when you are out of your bed at certain times then it might be benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Symptoms of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo are triggered by specific changes in the position of your head, such as tipping your head up or down, and by lying down, turning over or sitting up in bed. You may also feel out of balance when standing or walking.Since your CT scan brain is normal, it can help if you get Electronystagmography (ENG) or videonystagmography (VNG) done to record abnormal eye movements while your head is placed in different positions or your balance organs are stimulated with water or air. For this you might consult the ENT specialist."},{"Patient":"Hi, this is Kunal Chakroborty from Kolkata.

But i am assuming you are all right at present and at 3 years of age you developed weakness of all 4 limbs without any encephalitis like picture. So most plausible diagnosis may be Guillain barre syndrome which recover in few months. The recurrence of this disease is rare and you need not to worry. Other causes of quadriparesis may be cervical myelitis, hypokalemic paralysis and compressive lesion but is unlikely according to your history. I will advise to write in detail about your illness at 3 year age for better response.  God bless good health to you. Nothing to worry."},{"Patient":"Hello, Today I was playing a game of frisbee with friends. Me and a friend both went to catch the frisbee at the same time and did not see each other.

I also made a very harsh exhale sound as I was trying to breath that I could not control. I was able to get up and walk around. After I sat out for a while I was able to play again at a very limited level. I have put ice on my back, but I have a constant dull pain on my spin directly between my shoulder blades.

As this region of spine is well stabilised by ribs the likelihood of vertebral collapse is very low. Moreover you have not developed any limb weakness or urinary complains or respiratory distress. To me it doesn't seem to be injury of concern . For treatment you can use local analgesics ointment some pain reliever and rest.

But syncopal  attack is more plausible diagnosis as your loss of consciousness was postural and is associated with lightheadedness at onset. Seizure episode usually begins suddenly with abnormal jerky movements of limbs, neck deviation, tongue bite, incontinence and unrolling of eyes. Fortunately you don't have any such complains.  For investigation regarding syncope you need to get you blood pressure measured, ecg of heart. For treatment you should increase your salt and water intake, move legs before arising from bed or sitting position , leg stockings also helps. If all this measures don't help then medications may help. Avoid crowded and humid places and tight collar dresses. Consult a doctor for further evaluation.

TB tests were conducted with no positive result. Thereafter, she was moved to Chitra Medical Hospital, Trivandrum and her samples were sent to NIMHANS for further study. Meanwhile, this period my cousin was losing her vision. A brain surgery was carried out and it was found that the vein supporting the eye sight was blocked and it was infected. The doctors are saying that she will lose her eyesight in a few months or so because of the infection.

TB is a condition that can present with unique symptoms and involvement of the vein supplying the eyes is rare. Since a brain surgery was carried out, it is possible that the doctors took measures to safeguard her eyesight but little could be done as there was lot of infection. When there is significant infection, certain decisions have to be taken by the operating surgeon to protect the life of the patient and avoid further complications. To confirm TB or not you can send slides to research hospitals elsewhere in the country but the hospitals she has shown are well known for brain disease treatments. Particularly for her eyesight, it will help if you can request the eye surgeon to have a panel discussion with her neurologist."},{"Patient":"Hi I m a 19 yr old female with hydrocephalus and lately I ve been have a lot if headaches they r not as bad as and shunt malfunction headaches but they are not going away I ve trying caffeine, Advil nothing is working but I don t want to waste my time at the hospital if it s nothing any advice","Doctor":"Hello. I have been through your question and understand your concern.While headache might have many causes, in your case it is crucial to rule out any shunt malfunction, which I suppose you already know how hydrocephalus headache is manifested. If the ventricles are within normal dimensions there is reason to think headache is caused by it.So I believe this kind of headache is not related to your past medical history, and might be just a tensive type headache, which is the most common type of headache which does not always respond to caffeine and advil.Hope this helps.

Migraine is usually mild to moderate intensity, hemicranial,throbbing peaking in few hours and associated with nausea, vomiting, photophobia or photophobia.

BPPV is positional, lasting for few seconds associated with nausea or vomiting. Vestibular neuronitis is severe vertigo And associated with some viral infection.

Localized symptoms to one side is usually associated with some lesion in brain. Sometimes such patients who initially were having partial seizure with secondary generalisation or generalised tonic clonic seizure may have only some minor sensory phenomenon to the corresponding side due to drug control.  Rarely some patient have lesion at sensory cortex which may present with tingling in one arm or leg or half body.  Alcohol usually don't present this way but it is advisable to stop it's intake as it lowers the threshold of seizure and affects drug level in blood leading to increased risk of seizure.

I mentioned your age because it is a common process with aging so it could be considered normal if your age is advanced. It is not directly a cause for a headache.In order to limit its advancement you should pay attention to risk factors for blood vessel impairment like high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol and address them.If you are young then other causes must be considered like connective tissue disease, hereditary conditions etc.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"Husband just got MRI results back: \\"Abnormal appearance of the pituitary gland which appears enlarged and distorted with superior convex border which contacts the optic chiasm.\\"The doc who ordered the exam told him to go to the ER to have a Neurologist evaluate him.

The overwhelming part, including most common ones (benign tumors of the pituitary gland) are slowly progressive conditions which in my opinion can wait until next week. I am not even sure that it's the cause of the symptoms you mention, it is more probably finding caught by coincidence (compression of the optic chiasm can cause vision field issues, but not double vision - it doesn't look to compress the chiasm anyway).So unless there are new signs and quick deterioration of his condition I don't think you should rush to the ER.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"please explain to me what is lewy body/dementia.  my husband has been told he has this along withparkinson.

At your age a seizure is usually related to a lesion in the brain (tumor, stroke, infection etc) so an MRI must be performed as well as an EEG for electrical epileptic activity. According to the findings treatment will be discussed. If all comes back normal an evaluation for other possible causes of loss of consciousness like heart arrhythmia or abnormalities should also be considered.As for MS it is very very unlikely at your age. You say you've had symptoms for a few years, but still it would be over 55 and cases after the age of 50 are very rare.

Though it can occur anywhere in the body, but diabetic neuropathy most often damages nerves in your legs and feet.Depending on the affected nerves, symptoms of diabetic neuropathy can range from pain and numbness in your limbs to problems with your digestive system, urinary tract, blood vessels and heart. For some people, these symptoms are mild and not much of a concern while for others, diabetic neuropathy can be painful, disabling and even fatal.Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues. It might be that fibromyalgia amplifies painful sensations by affecting the way your brain processes pain signals and there are no specific features like those seen in diabetic neuropathy."},{"Patient":"My sonis30 tears old and was born with Asbergers syndrome not diagnosed until 21....then developed seizures ..now they have said his brain is shrinking and it is the size of a 65/70 year old man.

It will help to know if this brain volume loss happened in a few months or years. Any sudden decline in neurocognition is also important. The brain is such an organ that it does not regrow by itself. There might be metabolic changes happening and therefore the shrinkage of brain. It is important to restore as much cognitive functions by applying neuro rehabilitation techniques. There can be a possibility of brain stem cell techniques in the future by which certain areas of the brain can be restored and the cells regrown by using special methods. These might take some time and are still under research."},{"Patient":"I was wondering if it is possible to experience peripheral neuropathy only in the arms and hands and not legs or feet?

Few neuropathy may involve upper limbs first like porphyria, diphtheria, multi focal motor neuropathy with conduction block, vasculitic neuropathy. But definitive diagnosis can only be made on examination And nerve conduction study.

The \\"Impression\\" Scattered areas of low attenuation in bihemispheric white matter consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia and/or infraction. The letter also stated; the scan showed small vessel disease which can cause dementia. Can you give more info on this?","Doctor":"I read your query carefully and I understand your concern.Small vessel disease (or chronic microvascular ischemia, same thing), means narrowing of small blood vessels leading to low blood supply to the more distant areas they supply. It is a common finding with age so having it doesn't necessarily mean it's causing dementia (which usually involves memory problems). Only when it is advanced enough is it a cause for dementia and usually in small vessel disease memory is not the first to be impaired there are other signs including slow movement, rigidity etc.From a practical point of view to slow down its progression you have to address possible risk factors like high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking etc which influence it. Otherwise it's part of aging and as I said it's not necessarily the cause of her forgetfulness. The CT doesn't make the diagnosis, it is done to exclude other factors like tumor, big vessel stroke.  There are many types of dementia, the most common Alzheimer's which has memory impairment as an early and common feature which shows nothing on CT scan, it's the neurological exam which further directs the diagnostic process.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"Hello sir my sudanely problem before 24 days, firstly fiver & then Dr.ct  and MRI,diagnosis \\"neurocysticercosis\\"Dr give tablets 1-eptoin* 300 er mg 2-omnacortil 45mg 3-rheovit 4-protera 5-frisium 10 & no drive bike ,no TV & totaley rest so pls clear advic?but loss of office.and medicine long time taken.","Doctor":"I read your query and I understand your concern.If a diagnosis of cysticercosis has been established the treatment consists mainly on antiepileptics to prevent seizures and if the parasite from the imaging seems to be still alive antimicrobial treatment with albendazole.In your case it must be dead because you are only on antiepileptics (eptoin and frisium). The other 3 drugs are used to limit inflammation and protect your stomach from medicine. I don't think that you should be taking these last ones for long (omnacortil, rheovit and protera), meanwhile if you have seizures (you don't give much info on that) you should continue antiepileptics for a long time, perhaps always.

Since MRI brain is normal therefore a serious condition in the brain is ruled out. Dilantin can take some time to work and the response might take few days to show improvement. It is required that he consults a neurologist or an epilepsy clinic for a complete assessment and further investigations like electroencephalogram and a detailed medical history.

Concussions usually do not manifest into anything serious, however subtle symptoms like brain fog may persist for days to weeks.

As narrated by you the likely cause of these presyncopal and syncopal episodes may be autonomic dysfunction due to diabetes. Some elderly people may get such symptoms due to cervical spondylosis.

Patient given Soft copy of MRI study Findings: Straightening of lumbar spine noted. Marginal osteophytes noted at L3-4 level. Transitional vertebra noted (sacralization of L5). The vertebral body heights are maintained with normal marrow signal intensity pattern. Disc desiccation with posterior diffuse disc bulge and annular tear at L3-4 level mildly indenting thecal sac and moderately narrowing bilateral neural foramina. Disc desiccation with posterior diffuse disc bulge at L4-5 level minimally indenting thecal sac and narrowing bilateral neural foramina. Rest of the intervertebral disc normal. Facetal joints normal. Pedicles, laminae and spinous processes are normal. Visualized spinal cord, conus medullaris and thecal sac are normal. Both psoas muscles are normal. Both sacro-iliac joints are normal.

If symptoms don't subside local injections with corticosteroids and anesthetics are the next step. If still no success surgery could be considered, at times even earlier if there are new signs like motor weakness, saddle-like distribution sensory changes and micturition problems which could indicate cauda equina compression.You should also avoid heavy weight lifting if that is the case in your line of work.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"I was diagnosed with MS x 18 yrs, have been on Avonex x 17 yrs.

It is not typical though, urinary involvement is more common.I wouldn't see constipation as a cause, rather as another symptom along with lower extremity numbness and saddle sensory changes. I think the origin of the symptoms warrants MRI imaging of the spine not only for the MS lesions which I mentioned, but also for the possibility of disc disease or a tumor compressing the cauda equina (the bundle of nerves leaving the spinal cord at the lumbar region).I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"I have eye twitching, change in smelling and tasting, sleep trouble, numbness in fingers that turn colorless, and sometimes other facial twitching for a couple years, joint pain occasionally.

For neurocysticercosis fundus examination , subcutaneous nodules and x ray of long bones may be helpful. If nothing helps then albendazole therapy can be given and repeat imaging done to see for any lesion resolution.   Occasionally new lesions may appear in NCC but usually at different site.

You can continue hot fomentation and massage but excessive neck turning or movement should be avoided. Isometric exercises for neck and back strengthening exercises may help more. Long period of sitting in wrong postures may aggravate neck and back pain so avoid as much as possible.

But according to me if you are having this blackouts with amnesia of episodes and are of adult or elderly age then a possibility of Transient Global amnesia may be kept. TGA is usually due to atherosclerotic vasculature with impairment of blood supply to hippocampal region transiently. Second possibility may be of pre-syncope which requires presence of palpitation , sweating, light-headedness,  visual blurring ,feeling of give away and relation to standing posture.Third possibility may be of absence seizure which is more common in childhood and can be diagnosed by EEG study.In my opinion, broken tooth may not cause blackouts.Hope your problem gets an early diagnosis and you get well soon."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have speculated that I have ADD or ADHD for about 5 years.

He said the next step is for me to see a Neurologists. Could I possibly have Mastoiditis? I need help!","Doctor":"HIWell come to HCMNo this is not masoiditis but your symptoms of dizziness, confusion and others may be due to some functional elements, like emotional stress, depression, you really have to come out of this, be positive, practical, try some yoga, meditation, have enough sleep, everything would be fine soon, take care, have a nice day."},{"Patient":"Hi my name is Tina and I have a nephew that is 21 and he woke up the day before yesterday and he couldn t move anything on his left side.

I actually wore it all day yesterday and overnight. When I woke up this morning my hand was tingling and numb like it was asleep and the hair band was very tightly indented into my wrist. I removed it and still 12 hours later my thumb, index finger, and middle finger, as well as half of my hand and wrist are still partially numb and tingly. the indent from the hair band is gone, but a red welt is still visible most of the way around my wrist... Will the feeling come back to my hand and wrist?","Doctor":"According to your narration, it seems to be due to compression effect of band. Blood supply and neural supply may be impaired due to this compression. Persistence of numbness in thumb, ring and middle finger points to median nerve compression at carpal tunnel. In my opinion this may be temporary and will recover on its own if no swelling at wrist present and no distal skin changes in hand.  If symptoms persists you may have to undergo nerve conduction study for carpal tunnel syndrome. At present you may take Aceclofenac plus paracetamol and methylcobalamin for 4-5 days with rest of involved limb."},{"Patient":"I am 50 year old male I am having discomfort in my lower right side. it is tender to the touch when pushing in on the lower stomach. while I am standing it feels like something wants to come out of my stomach. no fever.

There are other inner ear problems which could also cause those symptoms, not only vestibular neuronitis.Also if there are other symptoms (headache, numbness or weakness of the limbs etc) other causes like stroke can be considered.

Absence of radiating pain to lower limbs, weakness in lower limb and non involvement of urinary symptoms are pointing towards intactness of spinal cord. My advice will be to get an xray of lumbosacral region to rule out any fracture.  Aceclofenac with muscle relaxant and rest may be helpful. Apply local ointment also.Wishing early recover and good health."},{"Patient":"Hi I get really sharp sudden stabbing pains on the right side of my head.when it happens it could be anywhere on the right side of my head but most of all behind my eye this pain is exscruciating behind my right eye and ear which cause temporary blurred vision in my eye and dizziness this happens most times this can happen 2-3 times a day some days or 10-15 times other days I ve been to docs and to hospital and have been told it s cluster headaches but I felt like I was told that just to get rid of me from the hospital can u help me I m really getting worried about this","Doctor":"Cluster headache is usually present in male with onset in young age.

It happens when there is a focus of small electrical discharge in the brain. The seizures in humans can happen even after many years and this can depend on the cause. It is important that you consult a neurologist and get clinically examined in detail. A CT scan and electroencephalography might be required. CT scan will tell if there is any structural problem that is causing your seizure and an encephalography will rule out any persistently discharging areas in the brain that can cause future seizures. Medications must be taken regularly to control seizures even if the cause of seizure is not known. These medications will raise the brain threshold of electrical activity in your brain and prevent precipitation of seizure.

Subconjunctival hemorrhage happens due to break of small blood vessels in the white part of the eye. The bleed is not absorbed quickly and might take some days to resolve. Isolated subconjunctival hemorrhage requires no specific treatment and heals in 2 weeks time. A subconjunctival hemorrhage changes colors and will fade from often red to orange to yellow over days.Patients often report a scratchy feeling in the eye and using eye drops like artificial tears gives relief.A conjunctivochalasis surgery might have to be considered only if you do not get relief from using conservative treatment like artificial tears."},{"Patient":"yes i had a severe head trauma 3 days ago that required 3 staples on the top left side. yesterday i started expirencing severe pain behind my left eye accompanied by blurred vision and eye twitching, and followed by a severe headache above the eye. i am wondering if this is normal and can be adressed with my dr in 3 days at the follow up or if i should seek imediate medical attention. thanks sam plumley","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Sorry to hear about the severe head injury you have had and hope you are recovering fast.The headache can be due to the injury but your blurred vision requires an immediate consultation with the ophthalmologist. The eyes are vital organs and have many connections in the brain. Eyes are made up of sensitive layers of tissues which help in image formation. An injury to the layers in the eye can cause blurred vision. It can also be caused by injury to nerves and muscles related to the eyes.

There is a passage in the spine running the neck to the lower back through which the spinal cord passes. In the lower back the spinal cord but the nerves continue to exit through small foramina on both sides of the spine. Disc bulges cause narrowing of the canal and pinching of the nerves leading to severe lower back pain. A spinal canal dimension of 5 mm in AP direction is small and can be the cause for significant pain and discomfort.

The lump is persisting since last 6 years. Most likely the lump is due to collection of blood which resulted in development of hematoma. The persistent headache is also a complication of head trauma. The symptoms of lack of concentration is also due to injury to brain. I would advise you to visit a surgeon for aspiration of the lump on forehead. If not properly managed it may result in development of infection which can prove serious. For headache consult a neuropsychiatrist for treatment.

As she has been operated for chiari malformations also ,it may be associated other developmental abnormality.EEG is an investigation to diagnose , classify the type of epilepsy and sometimes follow up to see the response. But in your case decrease in scholastic performance seems to be related to drug than to ongoing seizure as it will lead to some impairment in consciousness of drowsiness.

This is the mildest form of brain injury without any structural damage on imaging investigations. This takes a while to get normal and memory problems can occur. The tingling in left arm can be due to problems in the cervical spine or the brain itself. There was some evolving stroke like condition in your brain that was pre existing. After your auto accident this further intensified probably due to stress involved.

Please consult your doctors explaining your symptoms in details and ask for a scan if you can get one. Since you had to get two stitches, the wound might have been significant and there can be occasional confusion and fuzziness even with a slight head injury.

This is to enable a precise diagnosis and treatment. A CT scan or MRI scan will usually tell the extent and location of the lump.

Most likely it can be an epidermoid or dermoid cyst or sebaceous cyst. These are benign harmless swellings. Rarely these can extend in to the brain and it can only be known by doing imaging investigations.

The nerves supplying the arms also originate at the cervical portion of spinal cord in the neck region. These pass through small foramen in the cervical spine and then reach the arm. Sudden compression of the blood supply causes blackout and pinching of the nerve at its origin or anywhere along its route can cause numbness, tingling sensation as described by you. Since it is happening for last 2 or 3 years then you need to consult a neurologist and get examined in detail.

These bones have sponge like discs between them and the spinal cord passes along the back of these bones through the spinal canal. You seem to be having one of the discs protruding between the bones and this protrusion is backwards and causing narrowing of the spinal canal. A 8 mm disc protrusion is a large one and can cause significant pinching of the nerve roots at L 4 - 5 level leading to severe pain in  your back and legs.There are patients who get relief by doing physiotherapy and taking neurogenic pain relievers. If your pain is severe and not responding to medical treatment then the disc protrusion needs to be removed by doing a small surgery at the lower back region.

It is unusual for any one at 59 years to have a soft area as seen in a new born. It can be due to a change in the bones of the skull or due to something growing on the scalp under the skin. Since the nerves in different parts of the body are interconnected, it is possible that you are feeling the pains in the shoulder.

It can be a pre stroke symptom and you should consult your doctor and get completely examined. The blood supply to the brain from the heart is through the carotid and vertebral arteries. It is important to study the blood flow at the neck level and look for any narrowing or stenosis in the carotids and vertebral arteries on both sides. This is done by doing a Doppler study.You might also require a brain scan like CT scan or MRI scan to know if there is any condition inside the head causing your symptoms.It is important that you also tell your doctor of any heart conditions and medications you are taking for it. This is because there are many heart conditions which lead to symptoms in the brain like dizziness as a complication."},{"Patient":"My father in law is now 74 years old.

This is because other than the levels of spinal fusion, there are nerves getting pinched in some other places. Since a repeat surgery might not help much, it is best that you take conservative treatment with medications targeted to act on neurogenic pain.

If you got a MRI scan done then a white mass will  usually represent a fluid filled cyst but this is not always the rule. A cyst by definition is a thin walled water like fluid containing structure. Most cysts are benign and harmless.

A stroke is a condition in which there might be decreased blood supply or leakage of blood. The stroke in which there is decreased blood supply is called ischemic stroke and is commonest. Life expectancy after a stroke depends on many factors including the size of stroke, limitation or movements and supportive care, all of which eventually affect the general health condition of the patient. There have been cases where a patient lives for more than 10 to 20 years after a stroke with good supportive care.

Should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in to us.Bilaterally opacified mastoid air cells mean that the air containing spaces within the petrous temporal bones which are located behind the ear are showing some fluid collections. This can happen when there is an ear infection which causes seepage of fluids into these mastoid ear cells.

Periventricular white matter is the white matter areas in the brain which is found next to the ventricles or fluid containing spaces.

I spent a few days with him recently and was very impressed with his mental acuity.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Please re confirm the condition of your cousin as vascular dementia instead of vestibular dementia as mentioned. Vascular dementia is caused by reduced blood flow to the brain because there is a problem with the blood vessels that supply it. Parts of the brain become damaged and eventually die from a lack of oxygen and nutrients. However, unlike other forms of dementia, many cases of vascular dementia can be prevented.Once vascular cognitive impairment progresses to vascular dementia, the disease can only be slowed down, not stopped. Medicines may help control some of the symptoms. It is important to know the cognitive impairment and as you have mentioned that his mental acuity is impressive, I think he will not have much problems if taking regular medications."},{"Patient":"What does this mean, Delayed planar images demonstrate mild uptake within the left L4-L5 region.SPECT -CT of the lumbar spine was obtained.

It is possible that there are occasions when the blood supply to your brain might be less and this can be due to the flow dynamics through the carotid and vertebral arteries or if it is only experienced when you raised your arms then there can be a cervical rib causing momentary compression of blood vessels in the neck. The numbness can happen due to the cervical rib as well.

While nerve regeneration usually does not happen but since you do not have complete deafness, it is possible that you could still use an amplification device that will make sounds heard louder by you. It is important to get further hearing tests done and discuss autoimmune encephalitis with your doctor.Since there is temporal encephalomalacia, that part of brain related with memory has been affected.

There are mild inflammatory changes involiving the ethmoid and frontal sinuses. There are afew small discrete nonspecific high signal intensity foci within the juxtacortical and periventricular white matter of both cerebral hemispheres on the T2-weighted anf FLAIR pulse sequences. There is no transependymal spread of CSF. We have not discussed these results yet. Could I be dealing with a TBI?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is possible that you had a mild brain injury and this caused you to lose consciousness for about minute. Non specific white matter high signal areas on FLAIR can be due to many causes and if you do not have any other symptoms other than dizziness and poor memory then most likely it is due to the head injury on 14th July 2014. Since the brain volume is normal, it is unlikely to be a serious injury that you had. Mild brain trauma can cause memory problems and dizziness for a while. I suggest you attend neurological rehabilitation services at the hospital you attend and discuss your problems. There are many brain training exercises which can help you with your memory.The chronic mastoiditis is a concern because it shows a possible ear infection and if not treated in earlier stages, this can cause problems related to hearing  and also spread to the brain."},{"Patient":"My mom is 84.

These pass through small foramen in the cervical spine and then reach the arm, wrist and hands. Sudden pinching of the nerve at its origin or anywhere along its route can cause numbness, tingling, pain or a sensation of current passing as described by you.

Thank you, Bourke Corcoran YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The feeling of lightheaded after bending down is explainable. The brain gets its blood supply from the heart through the carotid and vertebral arteries. The carotid arteries transmit the blood along the front and sides of the neck region and the vertebral arteries run through the spine. When bending, it is possible that there is decreased blood flow to the brain momentarily and since you are experiencing it from when you were a young adult, it looks likely due to positional changes of the cervical spine and mild pressure on the vertebral arteries when you bend down. Lipitor (atorvastatin) is used to treat high cholesterol and will help in declogging your arteries should there be any blocks due to ageing. This will enable good flow of blood to your brain. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I was recently diagnosed with vertebrobasilar artery syndrome and want to know if there are any conditions that may develop in the future from this and what symptoms I can expect besides the droopy eye I already have and possibly blacking out from the artery being compressed.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Patients who have vertebrobasilar insufficiency can have a complete stroke if precautions are not taken and treatment is not started. It is best to quit smoking immediately, and control high cholesterol levels through diet, and exercise regularly. After discussing with your doctors, taking prescribed medication to control high blood pressure, lower blood cholesterol levels and block platelet function is important.Location of the plaque causing the vertebrobasilar insufficiency will determine whether repair of the artery is possible. Surgical or non invasivetreatment includes opening up of the narrowed portion. The further the plaque is from the brain, the more likely open surgical repair or endovascular repair will be considered as treatment options."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, My father suffering from TB in brain.

Any thoughts on what kind of seizure it may be and what additional tests should be done? thank you for any help you can offer. My email address is  YYYY@YYYY  Thank you Al","Doctor":"I read your question and I understand your concern.From your description of the episodes they can indeed be a case of seizures. They shouldn't be related to the back surgery itself. The EEG being normal doesn't exclude the diagnosis as it can be the case in the interval without seizures.Regarding the tests I think apart from routine lab tests (including electrolytes and tests for autoimmune disease), brain imaging is also required as at this age usually seizures have an identifiable cause. Also the EEG can be repeated because repeated EEGs increase the chance of chancing upon epileptiform anomalies. If the seizures are frequent i would consider being admitted to a neurology clinic, in order for the seizures to be seen by personnel which is used to the features of epilepsy and more qualified to distinguish seizures from other attacks like psychogenic ones or syncope. There are specialized clinics where prolonged EEG accompanied by video recordings side by side make for a better evaluation. If the seizures are rare, you live in a remote area and the doctor never happens to see one, you could also yourself film the episodes (with your smartphone if you have one) and show them to your doctor to facilitate his evaluation of them.If the clinical signs are convincing a normal EEG shouldn't be an obstacle to starting treatment.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"Hi Recently I had undergone surgery for wisdom teeth removal , unfortunatly I had a infra alveolar nerve damage and I lost sensation in my lip .

If nerve was only contused or pressed down, then a average six to eight weeks needed to full recovery of nerve function.

Irregular menstrual cycle could be one of the signs of Cushing, but could be present in other hormonal changes as well. In Cushing there are many other possible signs like weight gain, skin changes, hirsutism, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, mood changes, muscle weakness etc, the signs are so many really.

Normally, the fluid around the brain acts like a cushion that keeps the brain from banging into the skull. But if the head or body is hit hard, the brain can crash into the skull and be injured. A concussion occurs when the brain is shaken inside the skull, causing changes to the brain's chemistry and energy supply. Whiplash injury\\" describes damage to both the bone structures and soft tissuesand is typically not a life threatening injury, but it can lead to a prolonged period of partial disability .You should not worry about it . I would like to suggest you to see a neurologist for proper advice  .And for your info , you will have to work for speech and coordination of muscles Little exercise from head to toe  by rotating  neck , fingers , fist , arms  legs and feet ,thumbs etc .

You have developed symptoms immediately after trauma and there is history of dementia and cardiac problems in your family, this increases the risk of cognitive impairment. This is also called as Post Traumatic Dementia. I would advise you to visit a psychiatrist for management of dementia. Cognitive enhancer drugs like Donepezil, Memantin help to reduce progression of impairment. These drugs will not improve damage caused but will reduce further progression. Apart from that you should also try brain stimulation games like Sudoku, Crossword etc. This will help you to maintain focus and attention.Thanks, hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"I m taking phenobarbiton 90mg and eptoin 100mg at night for last 12 years, as I suffered from epilepsy.

They are not due to your epilepsy treatment (on the other hand in epileptic patients anxiety or mood disorders are found more often than in the general population).Regarding your questions on Betacap, it is a drug which causes neither weight gain nor mouth dryness, do not fear about that, usually those effects are linked with anti-depressants.

I do get tremors from my MS often , but this is different than what I normally have , it seems to have a mind of its own ... i am being checked for Parkinson s , and have an MRI next week ...","Doctor":"dear Scot,Twitching of a finger can have varied etiology.Our body movements are been controlled by certain areas of the brain, which is governed by various chemicals called neurotransmitters. Any change in the local or generalised levels of these chemicals in brain areas , can give rise to associated symptoms. Similarly, movement of little finger is governed by part of brain which involves a chemical \\"dopamine\\", essential for proper movements( smooth movements) of body. Variation in the levels of dopamine can lead to twitching of fingers, as experienced by you.Now Parkinsonism is a disorder, which consist of generalised dysfunction and set of symptoms clinically, and need to be confirmed on investigations like MRI,etc. It predominantly is due to depletion of this chemical of dopamine in brain.Therefore, there is possibility of it being due to Parkinsonism, however it is difficult to confirm as I can't see any associated symptoms or no investigation done as yet.I suggest you to follow the advice of your treating doctor.I hope to have satisfied your query.welcome for further information.thank you. stay healthy."},{"Patient":"Hello I am expierencing fatigue,insomnia,something effecting my brain and eyes, blurred vision , dizziness , seeing black spots and lines ,disorientation,nausea,unexplained weight loss (28 lbs.)

I have had a basic neuro exam done by my pcp and there was nothing he saw that worried him. My concern is that for the last month or so, I have had tinging/buzzing feeling in my left foot that is now happening more and more often, and I now have a tight/discomfort in my left calf muscle. Of course when I look it up, the internet assumes I have MS. I have an appointment soon with a Neurologist, but I wonder if anyone else has an opinion? Could it be an issue in my ankle? (I also recently began a swim class with fins without working my way into wearing fins. My achilles tendon is sore on that ankle, but nothing that has worried me until now.) Thank you.","Doctor":"Good evening.  I am a neurologist from Cleveland, OH and will give you a few ideas, however, the \\"computer\\" is right in covering the base of MS in someone your age with those types of symptoms.  It needs to be addressed.  There are some other things to think of that can give similar symptoms but here is the problem with most of the MS \\"mimickers\\"...most everything from B12 deficiency to sarcoidosis, to STD's, and metabolic diseases that one could imagine giving symptoms like that by and large occur over both sides of the body and do not stay fixed in one limb for very long.  Of course, if you also had some back pain to tell us about one could also imagine some sort of nerve root being compressed at the L4 or L5 level.  However, you would've come clean with the back pain right away at the beginning of your presentation if it would be important enough to cause these constant symptoms so I'm assuming back pain is not really a problem.  Other things such as transverse myelitis (TM) which is similar to MS but different could cause a focal finding such as what you describe but there would also be expected other findings such as weakness and bowel/bladder incontinence and so forth....back pain is a common finding in TM.  However, muscle cramping is frequently seen in TM as well and usually that early on in MS.Now, the swim class.  I do  certainly like the idea that all this could be due to using fins and doing an exercise which is typically pretty strenuous for most people and I would be very willing to accept this as an explanation.  Know how to find out quickly?  STOP THE CLASS AND WAIT A COUPLE of weeks.  Get some massages in the calf, the foot, and the ankle, and see what happens to your symptoms.  Perhaps, in some way you are ASYMMETRICALLY using your legs and feet.  If you are right dominant then, maybe you are favoring that side and struggling a bit more on the left making the calf, leg, and foot muscles do a lot of compensatory work that are just making it sore.Also, track the intensity and localization of your symptoms while you are in the swim class, wearing the fins, or if the symptoms don't develop in the water, how long after do they develop after the class?  Are they most intense immediately following and then, dissipate as the day goes on?  Are there other situations such as wearing dress shoes, wearing panty hose, and so forth where you'll notice symptoms at the time or shortly thereafter?If you'd like to ask me further questions directly on a 1-1 basis here on the network please contact me @:  bit.ly/drdariushsaghafi.I'd be very glad if you kept me in the loop and let me know what the final diagnosis is here once you've seen the neurologist if you decide to \\"keep me guessing\\" as it were!

It's going to be one of 2 things....either it's an enlarged lymph node which will eventually go back down and disappear or it may remain and calcify.....or it simply may be a calcified piece of bone.

He always passes out but he blacks out & has seizures. Friday he passed out & hit his head, he woke up & passed out again, hitting his head & he was taken to the hospital where they said he had a concussion. He hasn't woken up since Friday & the doctors aren't really doing anything. Why isn't he waking up? Is there something they can do?","Doctor":"I read your query and I am sorry for your friend.There are two possibilities. The first one is that hitting the head he has had traumatic brain injury. Concussion is one type of traumatic brain injury, but if he hasn't regained consciousness at all it must be more serious. To judge the degree and the need for any surgical intervention of course he has to have at least a CT scan, which you don't mention. If he has done it perhaps the damage is not of the sort which benefits from surgery, in that case treatment is only with drugs trying to prevent brain swelling, if that is the case it's not your doctors fault, that's all that can be done, improvement will need its time depending on the severity of damage. It depends on results of CT scan though, so I can't be more precise.Second possibility is his being in an epileptic status, meaning uninterrupted seizures, in that case treatment is with anti-epileptics and airway protection, at times can be a medication induced coma to stop the seizures and the brain swelling. If he has seizure activity it's easy to identify, but if no seizure activity and CT doesn't explain his non-waking up then a non-convulsive epileptic status needs to be considered which needs an EEG to confirm.Anyway, I hope I'm not confusing you even more, I know it's too many hypotheses, but as I said to be more precise at least the CT scan is needed.I hope things will go for the best."},{"Patient":"I have the Mirena IUD in, and I've had it for almost 3 years now.

Compression of nerve fibers at the cervical region, either due to mechanical compression or spasm of paraspinal muscles.2. Inadequate hydration status & electrolyte imbalance of the body.3. Dietary deficiencies of certain nutrients like Iron, Calcium, Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, Folic acid, etc. which help in blood formation & nerve conduction.4. Peripheral neuropathy caused due to any fluctuation in blood pressure or blood sugar level.Symptomatic relief can be obtained by intake of nervigenic agents (like Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, Folic acid) as well as multivitamin & multimineral supplements including iron, calcium & Vitamin D needs to be added in your diet.Physiotherapy & postural exercise will also be helpful.If symptoms still persist, kindly consult a Neurologist & get a complete Neurological examination done.Certain investigations like complete blood count, serum electrolyte estimation, fresh estimation of blood pressure & blood sugar levels & nerve conduction studies will be helpful to rule out any pathological cause for the symptoms.Wishing you a Good Health.Take care."},{"Patient":"Some time ago I underwent surgery for the removal of a cavernous angioma located in the right parietal lobe. The malformation was in an accessible spot so the procedure was relatively minor (as far as brain surgery goes).

Brain surgery itself doesn't change the risk of dementia, it is general anesthesia that in rare cases causes a dementia-like condition called Postoperative Cognitive Disorder. General anesthesia causes a inflamation of brain cells alike to that found in dementia.

My thoughts go for possible: gastritis/GERD or ulcer issues that should be determined. With regards to slight head pain and bouts of imbalance, I recommend to:- consult with ENT specialist to rule out inner ear issues- measure your blood sugar and blood pressure, record the results for future evaluation by your doctor (hypoglycemia and hypotension should be ruled out).

It also depends on the center your brother in law is being treated and their experience and level expertise for different treatment techniques, not all surgeons and neurointerventionist are the same when it comes to such specialized procedures.Generally speaking, both techniques have their advocates, perhaps noninvasive techniques are less risky in the short run, but surgical ones offer more long term assurance.

If you have back pain and sciatica, then you need to have a lumbar MRI, which I presume you did.If there is a herniated disc that explains your sciatica, even in the level of your previous surgery, then you should consider a second surgery. But there should be a clear radiologic and clinical correlation. Pregnancy with its weigh gain and increase in the normal anterior bending of the lumbar spine can worsen the back problem.So I recommend a Neurological or Neurosurgical consult to evaluate the radiologic finding and your symptoms to see if there is any indication for a second surgery.Hope this helps with your question, please feel free for further questions."},{"Patient":"Hi..I had an mri for a back injury..it said i have at L5~~~S1,mild broad based posterior disk protrusion abuts the ventral surface of thecal sac without canal stenosis..with left tangential L5nerve root abutment..what does this mean???..im 46   5ft 4 and 9st 6lbs..","Doctor":"I read your query and I understand your concern.That report suggest a disc disease, which for the moment looks not to cause any narrowing of the spinal canal and while close to the L5 nerve root causes no compression. So for the moment no surgery is indicated and should be continued with conservative management meaning physiotherapy and painkillers. Of course the severity of your symptoms should also be taken into consideration, but generally speaking from the report your current pain should improve gradually.Of course since there is some degree of disc protrusion, mild for now, if that progresses in the future might change aggravate the symptoms and change management. Physical therapy is the best way to lower the risk for that.I hope things work out for the best."},{"Patient":"I awoke yesterday morning, after having an unusual night of very sound sleep.

In my final year at school I was in the top 85 students in the country, and attended one of the best schools in the country. My problem is this: from approximately 11years of age I have had a very slight tremor in my fingers. This has become slightly more pronounced over the years. It now bothers me when doing fine motor tasks such as dissections. It is particularly noticeable after holding scissors or tweezers tightly for some time. It is also observable when holding a phone or tablet. It is especially noticeable if I tense my muscles. When lifting a mug of tea etc there is a much more pronounced tremor for about 5 degrees of motion to my mouth but is otherwise minimal in the path of motion. The tremor is very fine, but is visible in the fingers. I believe it to be a fast tremor. No tremor at rest. Tenor not visible at rest in fingers but if I deliberately stretch out my fingers flat like a small fan, the tremor is observable. Tremor is visible with or without caffeine intake. My stress levels are potentially higher than most, but not in anyway that it interferes with daily activities nor such that I am aware of it. My slight worry is that this might preclude me from specialising in surgery later. My mother has a minor tremor in her hands. Any advice?","Doctor":"as with your history you have essential tremor, your family history is posive as your mother has tremor. essential tremor is beningn condition with positive family history. it increases with stress. you can take beta blocker as prpanolol to relieve tremor. some cotraindication of beta blocker is asthma. bradycardia, diabetic history"},{"Patient":"My daughter was diagnosed with abson seizures today due to an abnormal EEG.

We push intake levels constantly.  He is on thyroid meds with good levels and has recently undergoing Pharma treatments for a possible TBI from car accident last year. There has been no additional sycopal episodes as a result of the accident that we know of. He had been to neurology, psychology, mri , x ray, eeg etc... All coming back within limits or unremarkable.

Your input is greatly appreciated.","Doctor":"I read your question and I understand your concern.Atlanto-axial instability with degenerative disease of the cervical spine could potentially be a cause for syncope. That is because they might compression of vertebral arteries which are in close relation to the vertebrae and that can cause intermittent insufficient blood flow to the brain stem.At times finding the cause of a syncope is not as straightforward as can be seen by the many negative exams you've done.

Secondly it can be due to stones in the gall bladder which is usually on right upper abdomen and under the rib cage. It can be associated with fever and it also aggravates on taking orally. It can be diagnosed on usg. The third common cause of pain in upper abdomen can be due to inflammation in pancreas (the organ which control sugars and helps in digestion of food) which is also diagnosed on USG and some times need CT scan.

In your case this narrowing involves mainly small vessels. What you could do to lower the risk of advancement and stroke is address those factors I mentioned as well as a blood thinner such as aspirin.Those factors are more often the cause, but at times there might be also genetic factors involved, metabolic factors like amyloid deposition in blood vessels.

From your description, if other common causes are being excluded, it could well be a case of anxiety.Regarding the treatment for starters measures like slowing a little down with her work, avoiding use of caffeine or other stimulants, regular sleeping hours are also important. If those are not enough then it depends. If for short periods of time benzodiazepines could be used but not for long because they cause dependency and tolerance. If it seems like a chronic problem then antidepressants are more indicated. Both groups should be prescribed by a physician after discussing their side effects.That is only after other causes are excluded though.

What should b done hence forth to avoid more complication. And what can happen at worst","Doctor":"I carefully read your query and I am sorry about your grandmother's health issues.The diagnosis of bilateral infarction would justify her symptoms. A lacunar infarction is small but since you say frontoparietal meaning involving two lobes I guess there must be multiple ones. Those infarctions have already happened now can't take them back but you can reduce the risk of further ones in the future by treating hypertension and high cholesterol you mentioned as well as with aspirin. The risk of her having a stroke will remain significant but by these measures we can lower it.As for the atrophy if severe it could be a sign of dementia, meaning a fall in her higher mental functions like memory, speech, judgement, complex tasks, planning and organizing, etc, if that is a case it is a progressive disease which could progress for years and render the patient unable to take care of herself and immobilized in bed. But I'm saying that just because you asked for worse case scenario. At the moment there is no diagnosis of dementia if there are no higher mental signs you have noticed, it's not defined by atrophy, atrophy is an aging process which can be found also in old people without dementia.There are many types of dementia, most frequent is Alzheimer's disease, but if there is Parkinsonian syndrome it can manifest dementia in advanced stages, as well as imbalance.

I have been through your questiin and understand your concern.The complaints you are experiencing are quite common and are reported when standing up very fast. This happens because for that short moment there is less blood going to your head causing these symptoms. Generally you should not worry. Drinking plenty of water and getting up slowly should resolve this. But, if it persist and becomes troublesome then you should consider orthostatic hypotension. Basically, you should get your blood pressure measured by your GP while being sitted and once you stand up. This would just confirm such an eventuality. Still, I dont see anything to be worried about. Drink plenty of water.Wish you the best health"},{"Patient":"My husband has been diagnosed with an irritated nerve root from his lower back several years ago. The pain radiates down his hip and leg.

He also has lower back degenerative disc disease which of course cannot be treated with surgery. Even with the oxyneo twice daily plus morphine 2mg for breakthrough pain, he still suffers.

A brain tumor or the surgery for it doesn't cause ear bleeding especially since in this case it is bilateral.The most common cause for that would be trauma, use of blood thinning products, bleeding tendency, bilateral infection.To make a diagnosis though, a complete blood count and coagulation tests, as well as physical examination by an ENT (ear-nose-throat) specialist is required.I hope to have been of some help."},{"Patient":"Hello!  I just had a spinal tap done. My Dr is looking for MS or another issue that could be causing my symptoms. My test results are. Glucose CSF (67), Protein CFS (31.0), Tube Number (4), Color and Clarity is Colorless and Clear, White Blood Cells CSF (3), Segmented Neutrophils CSF (1), Lymphocytes CSF (85), Monocytes (14). Everything else was a 0 so I didn't put them down. What can cause the Lymphocytes to be so high? Will MS cause this? Thanks Christine","Doctor":"I read your question and I am sorry about your concern.Those results show an elevation of the protein and the lymphocyte count. Before continuing I must point out that the White Blood Cells (WBC) count must be mistaken because the WBC include all the neutrophils, lymphocites, monocites so number can't be lower as it's their sum.Regarding the question on multiple sclerosis, well yes, it can show high lymphocyte and protein numbers. On the other hand they can change from other causes as well, like from central nervous system infections. So the diagnosis is directed by the history and clinical exam.However usually to search for the diagnosis of MS, the spinal tap is obtained more for the purpose of testing for what are called immunoglobulins and the presence of oligoclonal bands. I don't know if those have been tested, the rest doesn't help much for the diagnosis of MS. Usually the diagnosis of MS if put by MRI, and spinal tap is obtained if in doubt to search for oligoclonal bands.I hope to have been of help.

The       characteristics are most likely that of gliosis and cystic       encephalomalacia secondary to an old small infarct. Separately,       there are a number of additional tiny foci of scattered T2       hyperintensity in both cerebral hemispheres compatible with       minimal microvascular ischemic disease","Doctor":"I read your query and I understand your concern.That MRI report doesn't show any acute lesions, nothing threatening in short term. However it shows the remains of a small stroke, which you have had a long time ago. Perhaps you already knew that, but if you didn't it is not surprising because it is a small stroke and could have happened without major noticeable symptoms. There are also small scattered changes related to narrowing and occlusion of small vessels.This report indicates that you are at risk of having a stroke in the future so you should pay attention to risk factors for that and address them. Risk factors include high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol, obesity, sedentary lifestyle. Correcting them will lower the risk for stroke in the future.It would be useful to know your age. These findings are frequent in the older population, but if you are young and without risk factors known then you should also be evaluated and tested for other rarer causes like inflammatory conditions, metabolic conditions, genetic inherited conditions etc.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"I am a 57 y.o. woman with some prehypertension, slightly elevated cholesterol, no diabetes.  I had a severe bout of depression and anxiety recently, which I am being treated for, but I have since been feeling more cognitively slow, and have some tremors in my hands at times, and some muscular twitches in various parts of my body.  I had an MRI to rule out MS (which my mother had), and they found microvascular ischemic changes bilaterally in my brain.  The neurologist said this amount was pretty average for my age.  I also recently had a cardiac calcium score done - it is 1.  Should I be concerned about this MRI?  At the height of my depression, I was in bed for 3 days with severe headaches (I also have cervical spine degeneration) but I actually felt like I had had a mini-stroke.  Has my brain had little mini-strokes, thus the ischemic changes?","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query and I understand your concern.Technically speaking those ischemic changes are a part of the stroke spectrum, meaning it is a case of an occluded vessel not supplying enough blood. However it is the case of very small vessels and what your neurologist meant is that a certain amount of these changes of small vessels happens in many people over the course of years and are not responsible for your symptoms, can be found in many other people your age without any symptom at all. If these changes are markedly widespread it could be a cause for cognitive changes, I can't evaluate that without the images, but since he has told you they are average for your age I suppose he has considered that.So you shouldn't be concerned too much, although you should pay attention to blood pressure and high cholesterol to lower your future risk of stroke (a recommendation which would be given even without that MRI).I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"My son thinks he has had a seizure.

PLEASE HELP","Doctor":"I read your query and I understand your concern.Since you mention burr hole surgery, I am assuming his probable diagnosis is a subdural hematoma. That means blood along the surface of the brain. That presence of blood (some of it could be still left after surgery) could irritate the brain surface and cause abnormal discharges, hence seizures. It may not happen at all but there is an increased risk compared to the normal population. That is why I presume the neurosurgeon has prescribed Levipil even though he has never had a seizure.Whether I agree with that is another issue. Generally I don't start antiepileptics unless there has been a seizure. But there is not always consensus on every issue between doctors especially on issues like this where it's a matter of risk percentages not of certainties, doesn't necessarily mean there's a \\"good\\" and a \\"bad\\" doctor.

Excess \\" water\\" or liquor in brain, can be hydrocephalus. In old people may be secondary from cerebral atrophy, may be from liquor malabsorption, or may be result of lesions compressing liquor circulation pathways. Treatment depends on the cause.

If it was a case of separate rare episodes it might be normal but since you describe the episodes as happening every time the cause must be looked into.The possible causes could be many. If you are taking certain drugs (like antidepressives, antihypertensives) it could be a side effect of theirs.Otherwise a complete blood count and routine biochemical tests would be the first step in my opinion (to rule out diabetes, electrolyte changes, anemia etc).Regarding the specialist since the possible causes are many, belonging to different specialties being checked by a general practitioner or an internist would be wise.

On Saturday sometime he had another CT Scan that showed the right side of his brain had stroked. He has swelling in the brain and is unresponsive at this point. However, he does react to pain in his extremities. His left pupil reacts to light somewhat, but right pupil nothing. The doctor has been very vague and not sharing much information with us. He is off all sedation medication and was breathing just yesterday unassisted. He has not woke up yet and scans are only being done about every 3 days. We have been told by nurses that we should just wait to see if he does wake up or wait for a response from a command given. The doctor has stated that if the swelling goes down that the stroke can reverse itself and that he may recover. All vitals are great, heart rate, blood pressure and 02 levels. Should he have awakened by now? I know my Father in law would not want to lay there like that, but we really don t want to lose him either. What should we expect and can he recover and what time period should we expect to see a commanded response?","Doctor":"I read your query and I am sorry about what you are going through.From what you are describing he has had a severe stroke involving a large area of the brain. The fact that you say his right pupil is large and unresponsive indicates a big lesion with edema which is compressing his brain stem and if the pressure augments even more it could be fatal. Unfortunately right now as your doctor has said you should just wait for the edema (swelling) to stop and then gradually subside, even in the best case scenario it won't happen in one or two days, could take several weeks. Also there is also the risk of other non neurological complications which could present in many intensive care unit patients, like for example infections which in his critical condition are more likely to happen and difficult to treat, pulmonary embolism etc.As for the long term, that is in case he survives this critical phase and recovers consciousness, you should understand that most probably some residual disability will be left. Some part of his brain is irreversibly dead, given the stroke gravity you're describing that is for sure I am afraid. I am not saying that improvement is not possible, but it will depend more on the undamaged areas compensating for the lost ones. How much improvement there will be varies, even for the same stroke size and gravity it may vary from one patient to the other. What you should understand is that it would take several months and it will be more a question of prolonged physical therapy rather than miracle working drugs.I hope things will work out for the best."},{"Patient":"Hi, I had an MRI 20 days ago.

It usually occurs because of loss of CSF pressure and volume during procedure. It is usually associated with neck and some times shoulder pain. It usually last for 2-3 days. Local backache at puncture site is also common finding. In severe cases nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are seen. Best thing to avoid this is to -Take plenty of fluids. -Take complete bed rest for at least 2 days, avoid excess motility.-Tea and coffee help to prevent it.-If still persist then OTC analgesics like paracetamol will help to control.As per my opinion you will find improvement with these measures, if headache increase in severity or persist then visit a doctor.Thanks, hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"Hello, my brother aged 58 suffering from parkinson disease for more than 20 years.He takes syndopa plus and syndopa cr 1/2 tabs morning and evening.And in the night amantrel caps.The side effect of syndopa is his grip of hands is improving to dine and bath.

Had brain scan nothing found","Doctor":"Read your question and I am sorry about your complaints.The drugs that you mention are not used to treat tinnitus and vertigo, at least not directly. Zestril is used to lower high blood pressure, lipantil and ezetrol to lower blood lipids. These are chronic conditions, the aim of the drugs is not to cure but to lower and control them in order to limit their negative effects mainly in blood vessels. Aspirin is used as a blood thinner to lower the risk of infarction (lack of blood supply, people with high blood pressure and cholesterol are at risk). So what I am trying to say is that these drugs could be used for a lifetime. If your doctor gave them to you for the vertigo I assume they suspected they were related to high blood pressure or narrowing of blood vessels with insufficient blood flow to your brain.The causes for tinnitus and vertigo can be variable, sometimes related to your inner ear and a otolaryngology consult could be advisable. However since you have that persistent pins and needles feeling in you left hand I think a neurologist should evaluate you first for neurologic signs. According to his findings he will decide whether other exams are necessary like ultrasound of cervical blood vessels or even Angio MRI of brain and/or cervical region, to look for involvement of brain or blood vessels which a brain CT scan might miss.Hope my information was of some help to you.

As a precautionary measure, they have given antibiotics of which 2 doses have been taken. Today morning there is some swelling above on the eye brow area. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hi,The abrasion over forehead has got infected due to the scratching. Finger nails contain bacteria and the wound was contaminated when your daughter scratched the wound. This caused seeding of bacteria on the forehead and pus formation. You must see the surgeon and continue giving her antibiotics. This has to be watched for 10 days. If the wound does not start healing then even after that then surgical incision and drainage has to be done under aseptic precautions."},{"Patient":"Since yesterday I have had sharp pains in my upper abdomen and back. and even some discomfort in my left shoulder blade.

Could my high bp be because of my pain or something more serious?","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to Health care magic forum.                      The pain usually appears to be due to the gastric irritation, due to the irritant foods,peptic ulcer, or indigestion.                      I advise you to consult a gastroenterologist for diagnosis and treatment. You may need to have a gastroscopy, and ultrasound for diagnosis.                     I usually prescribe to my patient with such symptoms omeprazole, domperidone, and anesthetic antacid gel.

U should discuss choking & swallowing issue with your pcp at the earliest. Spinal stenosis is common at this age because of old age related degenerative changes."},{"Patient":"My wife she is 45 years old, 150 cm height, 65 kg weight, she is suffering by back pain fast 10 years.

If your surgeon feels that your problem is correctable surgically and you feel that it is enough of suffering to bear, than it is the time to get operated. Certainly all non operative measures should be tried before that. Is the problem curable can be decided only upon examining the patient and her investigations and imaging which I am sure must have been done by your doctor who recommended surgery.

He is depressed also and says he need to smoke. Is this going to affect him and his recovery or do anything to his brain .","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern.That being said if we are speaking about his recovery from the brain tumor surgery I don't think that either marijuana or smoking will have a big impact. The effects of marijuana on the brain need still further studies. There are indications about changes it can produce, but for long term use ones, don't apply to your worry about the recovery from the surgery in the next months. There is no data to indicate any effect on brain tumor.Smoking, while dangerous as it is one of the main risk factors for stroke, cardiovascular and respiratory disease which can affect the brain in the long term future, carries no short term risk about his recovery.So bottom line while both smoking and marijuana are two dangerous addictions which I strongly recommend him to quit due to their long term use consequences, I don't think you should panic about their current use inhibiting his recovery. Perhaps he should be evaluated and if necessary treated about his depression though.Hope to have been of help to you, feel free to ask further questions."},{"Patient":"My MRI summary: Evidence of anterior fusion from C3 to C5. no bone marrow or cord edema.

I read your question carefully and try to answer it to the best of my possibilities.The MRI report indicates narrowing of your small blood vessels, leading to some of them being blocked and causing these small foci which are tiny brain areas damaged by not receiving blood by these blocked vessels.Their significance depends however also on your age and possible diseases. If your age is advanced then this type of damage is a common finding. They are favored by conditions like hypertension, diabetes, smoking, obesity and blood lipid abnormalities and the best way to limit this vessel narrowing process is to address the above-mentioned conditions.If you are young and don't have any of those risk factors then you should be looked into for a long list of other possible reasons like metabolic disorders some of which inherited, connective tissue disease, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases etc.Hope to have answered your question.

His body is also tremoring very frequently.Please advice.","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for your query. I can understand your concerns.Parkinson's Disease typically does not cause muscle weakness .Weakness of legs and hands experienced by your father is due to severe bradykinesia  due to Levodopa (sundopa 110mg-TID) induced motor complications 'wearing-off effect'.With continued treatment,the duration of benefit following an individual dose becomes progressively shorter . During such \\"off\\" periods  they suffer severe parkinsonism (akinesia & tremoring  very frequently).They can often be improved by dividing the levodopa into smaller but more frequent doses, or by converting to a slow release preparation. These patients may also be benefited by  giving Levodopa with Selegiline. Selegiline, a type B monoamine oxidase inhibitor, inhibits catabolism of dopamine in the brain. This sometimes smoothes out the response to levodopa. Regards Dr. T.K.

She is alcoholic as well as smoker.","Doctor":"Hello dear,Fairly speaking episodic rolling back of tongue with numbness in legs,doesn't fit with any organic disease in the body.Some patients with dystonia may have episodic rolling back of tongue,but simultaneous numbness in legs does not go with it.It is most probably,some sort of psychosomatic manifestation.Next step for you should be to visit a psychiatrist and if he says so,then to a neurologist.Hope it helped."},{"Patient":"Sir, I had epilepsy from last 8 years I am in eight class when I suffered from pneumonia than doctor gave me tabetss of chloroquinine after that I am just have tremble in my body.

But there is our college trip than I got my first seizure and slowly I know that I am an epileptic patient. Now I got seizure when I am restless I want to ask you about permanent treatment for epilepsy. Please suggest me sir Thanks","Doctor":"Hello dear,Don't feel so low,as epilepsy is not a curse.Whether you have it or not,a doctor can't tell unless one see you having it or unless he is provided with accurate description of the event.Best thing for you is to video record a typical episode and visit a neurologist with the video.Even if it is epilepsy,treatment drugs depend on the type of seizure,as there are several seizure types and drug of choice for every seizure type is different.Some epileptic persons performed great in life,like Sir isaac newton,johnty rhodes.So,don't be so sad."},{"Patient":"Hi, i was wondering how often a Syrinx of the spine is often misdiagnosed. I was told by an orthopedic, neurologist and a neruosergon that I have a syrinx in my spine. When I moved at the beginning of this year I was getting looked at by my orthopedic here and after looking at my MRI he said he doesnt see one at all and that it happened that people are misdiagnosed. Its hard to know who is right because Im not a doctor. When I look at my MRI and look at images online of what I should see I cant see anything that looks like a Syrinx. Thoughts?","Doctor":"Hello dear,First of all,my reassurance for you.We, the doctors,treat the patients and not the MRI's.The very basic of a clinical practice is to correlate the clinical symptoms and signs of patients with investigations.In fact,in the older days,when there were no MRI's,patients used to be diagnosed accurately with precise clinical skills of the doctor.Investigations are meant just to supplement the clinical findings and not to replace the clinical history and examination of the patient.Coming on to syrinx in MRI-the appearance of syrinx is a linear slit like hyperintense signal in MRI spine,which is to be correlated for sure with the clinical findings of the patient like limb weakness,atrophy or thinning of the limb,fasciculations.In absence of any of these,or in a completely normal individual,I would rather say it has more chances to be some artifact,if at all is there.Many hyperintense signals in MRI's dont have any clinical relevance.Just to mention,30 percent of normal brain MRI's have hyperintense signals,that doesn't mean,we start treating every normal person for nothing he has got.One question-why were you visiting ortho surgeon?One tip for your reassurance-Please visit a neurologist and get examined yourself,if any problem.I hope it helped."},{"Patient":"In Sept 2009, I had a right frontal lobe benign meningioma removed by craniotomy. Lost my sense of smell. Now I have a right frontal encephalomalacia, per my medical records I just read. What is encephalomalacia? Should I be concerned? Is this normal after a craniotomy? I have not been feeling very well and I have memory problems.","Doctor":"I went through your query and I am sorry about the health issues you have gone through. However you have no reason to worry about that encephalomalacia report, it is perfectly normal after the sort of surgery you've had, it is a consequence of some tissue having been removed, it won't progress or cause any new complaint in the future.Because some brain tissue has been lost there is the chance you could have some memory problems left, although if the problems seem to be progressing over time you should be evaluated for other causes of their worsening.Hope to have been able to ease your worries.

She has been rushed back to the hospital with Seizures: her right arm shakes, her eyes roll back, she loses time does not remember having a termor/seizure and has to wait until she can speak again. Several visits later - the last one On friday , October 3rd , 2014 in which she had in front of the Dr. they got her to a neurologist & they did a weekend analysis (Head items on her head) and told her 4 = 6 weeks until results. They have no idea what is causing this and are not ready to say seizures and or termors at this point. Im very frightened for her,","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I am sorry about the you sister in law's troubles.Seizures are not usually related to back issues. They can have many diverse causes like infections, stroke, brain tumor, metabolic alterations of blood and tissue components (electrolytes) etc. So many exams are often needed to find the cause the cause like head CT or MRI, EEG, blood tests, cerebrospinal fluid tests and according to their results the cause is treated. Of course seizure treatment can be started rightaway without waiting for the results of all the tests, there are many drugs available (valproic acid, carbamazepine, levetiracetam, phenytoin, etc) which I am sure the neurologist knows, but while they're important to control the current situation, to make a prediction about what to expect in the future depends on what the cause is which must be evaluated with the above mentioned tests.Hope things work out for the best.

Your friend most probably had focal seizures for which likely cause can be a structural lesion in brain,causing a shadow appearance on brain imaging.Induced coma is usually given for refractory seizures,not responding to antiepileptic medicines,and probably that was the case with your friend.Hope it helps.Please get in touch,if you need any further explanation."},{"Patient":"Hello my name is kare.3 days ago I injured a few ribs on my upper right side right under the side of breast.

If the symptoms of bloating are after incident only i am sure it is due to trauma and will resolve so will the cough. Hurting on taking deep breaths and coughing is explained by the ribs injury. Now the bloating can be treated symptomatically meanwhile with prokinetics and soft fibrous diet.

It s so annoying because I can t focus with this feeling in my head?","Doctor":"Sinus pain is where the sinsues are (near the nose). Many other headache possibilities and a reason for a head scan if it is a new headache. AND..... a nerve pinched at the very top of the spin in the back of the head gives pain in that area that goes up the back of the head to the top. It is associated with muscle cramps and generally gets worse with any moviement of the neck (bouncing, turning , walking, etc.) This is a sserious condition because if the spine is unstable it can lead to total paralysis--broken neck. AND simple x-rays of the neck can spot this."},{"Patient":"Hello,I have read about the positive effects of acetylcholine supplements on various cognitive functions, including attention, learning and memory ( I have also read that it is most effective to stack all 3 types of acetylcholine supplements: Acetylcholine Agonists, Choline and Acetylcholine Sources, and Acetylcholinesterase Antagonists ( My first question is, do you have any experience with these supplements and their effects? My second question is this: I currently take a prescribed dosage of 400mg of Lamictal (Lamotrigine). Is there any risk of interaction-related side effects if I opted to start taking a combination of Acetylcholine supplements? Thank you very much! -Trevor","Doctor":"Hello thanks for asking from HCMAcetylcholine is one of major neurotransmitter in brain. It is involved in memory registration, retention and recall functions. It is involved in maintenance of cognitive functions and in learning. Acetylcholine supplements agonists like Piracetam help in improving attention span and memory. Piracetam is safe to use but the drug requires proper prescription by a doctor. Choline sources can be taken and will help in improving cognition. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are the main drugs that are used in dementia. Commonly Donepezil, Rivastigmine are used and have nice effects in improving memory and in decreasing the progression of dementia. These drugs also require prescription of a Psychiatrist.Lamotrigine is a mood stabiliser drug and there are no serious interactions or side effects if you use the drug with acetylcholine supplements. Consult a Psychiatrist for details.Thanks, hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"hi My younger brother who is now 28 years old had met with an accident in 2003. He did not have an external injury.

There are several options to alleviate your symptoms which include psychotherapy or pharmacological therapy. You should also try to lead a regular lifestyle, regular sleeping hours avoid sleeping during the day, avoid drinks containing caffeine or other stimulants, especially before bedtime. Regarding pharmacological treatment it depends. Since you say you've had these problems only for the couple of days and that episode 2 years ago then I think a drug of the benzodiazepine class should be used, but only for short term treatment 4 weeks at most because they create dependance and tolerance. They constitute no problem for your seizure issue, at times they are used to treat seizures actually. If on the other hand psychotherapy doesn't work and the problems seems to have become a persistent one then other more suitable antianxiety alternatives like antidepressants should be considered.These are drugs which must be prescribed only after doctor evaluation (neurologist or psychiatrist) though, especially in your case as some antidepressants are not suited in patients suffering epilepsy.Hope these episodes are temporary and you won't need prolonged treatment.

However stroke is an acute disease which manifests itself abruptly while in your case the headache and vomiting are prescribed as having a gradual progression which is not typical for common stroke. Of course despite the fact that stroke is not likely to be at the root of your symptoms, I think you should still see a neurologist for your chronic headache to determine their exact type, other possible causes for their worsening and medical therapy.As for the MRI result I don't think you should panic, that aging issue which has been reported must always be seen in relation to your higher brain functions (memory, language, judgement), only if there are clinical signs of their impairment is it worrying.

It does not usually cause any pain, but it can cause numbness or itching.'. A common cause is awkward postures that compress the nerves. Tingling sensations can also be symptomatic of nerve damage or nervous system disorders.The feeling of pins and needles is known as \\"paresthesia.\\" Most people associate it with sleeping incorrectly on a nerve. This causes the nerve to stop sending signals so that it \\"falls asleep\\" and creates a feeling of numbness. When pressure is taken off of the nerve, the body sends shock waves down the nerve to wake it up. This is what creates a feeling of pins and needles.But paresthesia doesn't just occur when a nerve has pressure. It may also occur during anxiety, especially during panic attacks. That's because during panic attacks, the body becomes more prone to hyperventilation.During hyperventilation, the body has too much oxygen and not enough carbon dioxide. That imbalance causes every vessel inside the body to constrict, while simultaneously reducing the release of calcium into the nerves. Both of these cause the nerves to feel \\"tingly.\\" Some vitamin deficiencies, such as low levels of magnesium, Vitamin B12, and vitamin B5 can also cause a tingling feeling and contribute to anxiety sensations .Prim rose oil is another very effective home remedy for tingling numbness. Apply the oil in to the affected area and gently massage, 2 to 3 times everyday. It shows quick results.Exercise of overall body and perticularly feet by rotating  feet and legs from heels and knees will help  blood circulation and allay feeling of tingling . Yoga and pranyam with meditation help attain perfect  disease free ,healthy  life .and intake of fiber ,& diet of all essential nutrents helps gain over all health .Steer clear of ,fast foods ,processed foods , caffeine and alcohol ,smoking, mental stress  , worry , anger ,constipation ,  they reduce the flow of blood to the extremities.It's still important to see a doctor to ensure it is nothing more serious.

It came back today at 2:30 p.m. It is only located in the center and I have no pain anywher else.","Doctor":"I am sorry about the problems you are experiencing.Having lived with a MS diagnosis for 10 years I suppose you understand that it's a chronic condition. While there are unfortunately no treatments to extinguish the disease these days there are many available treatments to slow down its progression and disability. Some of them have been available for more than a decade like Interferons, but there are many new therapies which have come out in the last few years, Tecfidera being one of them. Since it's a disease with a course of many years, to reach a conclusion about the efficacy of this or other new drugs a follow up of many years  is needed. The same applies to its long term side effects. The most common side effects known till now are flushing and gastrointestinal problems, mostly in the first month. So it shouldn't be the cause of your chest pain. As I said with time new side effects may be reported, but in this drug's particular case we are more confident because it has been used for a long time already for the treatment of a skin condition called psoriasis so its side effects are better known compared to other new treatments.I think you should report it to your doctor though. It may be a simple case of anxiety which if frequent and bothersome can be treated, but also other heart or respiratory system problems must be excluded.I hope to have been helpful to you.

The good news is that in most cases of bruising, these lumps are not a cause for concern .Bruises are an injury to the soft tissues under the skin. Blood collects at the location of the injury, and initially causes the distinctive red and blue coloring under the skin. As the bruise heals, it may turn yellow, until it finally resolves after a few weeks.applying heat after that helps the body absorb the old blood quicker, which speeds up the healing process .Take turmeric powder a spoon with a cup of hot milk  at bed time  and in BF Ror instant relief  Take Homeopathic  Ledum 30 /2 drops / thrice / in gap of 1/2 hour .

I've also been getting this tingling sensation in my fingers, lips and left leg. but not a numb feeling. it happens at random moments when I'm standing still or moving around. am i just tired and stressed? should i be worried?","Doctor":"Hello thanks for asking from HCMTingling sensation in fingers, feelings of disorientation (or brain fog), dizziness etc symptoms can occur due to a number of reasons in a healthy male-- First possibility is some nutritional deficiency. Low haemoglobin levels or anaemia is one of common reason for such symptoms along with tiredness. Low vitamin B12 levels can cause dizziness and tingling in fingers and nerves. I would advise you to get your Hb, Vitamin B12 levels checked to rule out these possibilities.- Hyperthyroid state can also cause such symptoms. You have to get your thyroid levels checked to rule out these symptoms.- Other possible cause can be due to anxiety or depression. In severe anxiety symptoms like dizziness, stress, tingling in fingers and lips can be seen. I would advise you to consult a good neuropsychiatrist for proper evaluation and treatment.Thanks"},{"Patient":"I have a couple brain lesions that no one to this day has ever been able to figure out.

The most important thing in your history is you not having neurologic problems. The lesions seen probably on a radiologix exam may have probable causes.

I understand that peri-menopause could cause this but I still am very worried.","Doctor":"Well in order to discuss the treatment first of all it must be determined what the cause is. Actually even that follows a careful evaluation to determine whether there is a real memory impairment or perhaps that impression is given by lack of attention often in the setting of issues like anxiety or depression sometimes associated with menopause. If a true memory impairment is found, other higher brain functions language, judgement, complex motor skills are tested as well.Afterwards as I said the cause must be searched for. There can be many causes like hormonal and metabolic alterations, nutritional deficiencies, toxins, vascular or degenerative impairment of the brain etc, some of them reversible some not.  So such a vast array of possible causes often means having to take many blood or imaging test in order to make a diagnosis.As might have understood from this long explanation it is impossible to make an accurate diagnosis and hence to responsibly answer your question about treatment, I think you should contact a doctor, possibly a neurologist."},{"Patient":"hi i got my ear pierced yesterday but the guy took it out right after i got it because i said i felt dizzy and nauseous. after 10 minutes i came back to my old self and i was perfectly fine. the guy there didnt recommend me getting my ears pierced again since my body would probably reject it again. so i was wondering why i felt nauseous and if i should/can repierce my ears since it closed uo after the guy took it out..","Doctor":"Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns.

My question is how do I decipher what symptoms go with what diagnosis because it appears that the same symptoms can either be from this illness and that illness? I done a lot of pineal cyst research, of what is out there.","Doctor":"I don't think the pineal cyst is responsible for your diagnosis. It's of a small size and there is no reason for it to cause any symptoms, pineal cysts are found by coincidence in many people. As you yourself said many of your other medical issues can cause overlapping symptoms and justify your complaints, but I don't think the pineal cyst has to with that and I agree with your neurologist's recommendation of leaving it as it is and have a control MRI, perhaps even later than 6 months, say in a year."},{"Patient":"my husband age 65 just diagnosed with myasthevia gravis. otherwise in good health. only area affected in drooping eyelids. More in right eye then left. taking 2 mestinon pills 5x a day . This is working, What can we expect in the next year or two?","Doctor":"Well it's hard to say because there are different grades of myasthenia gravis, some cases remaining isolated to the eye muscles and other more serious cases involving other territories becoming more threatening. For now since his symptoms seem to be confined to the eyelids and he's responding well to a low dose of Mestinon you have good reason to be optimistic, but you must be prepared for the possibility of it involving other muscles as in many patients that is the case. For that reason you'll need regular follow-up with your neurologist for periodical evaluation and reconsidering of the treatment."},{"Patient":"my aunt is 40 year old.she got paralyzed 1 month back.she is not able to speak and coundn t gain her sense for normal routines.she repeats what we say but no gained her common sense to talk.Doctor says it will take time but with her very slow progress i am worried","Doctor":"You are not saying what was the cause for the paralysis. I'm assuming it's a stroke. If that is the case usually most improvements are expected during the first 6 months, given her young age you can expect a better outcome. However how much of her functions will she recover is hard to say without knowing the exact extent of the damage. While you should conserve hope as it is a several months long process, if the damaged area is big you should also be aware that some disability may persist."},{"Patient":"Hi my name is Carolyn, I have extremely high cholesterol, dr. started me on  pravastatin a week ago, now for the last 2 days I have had these pains in the lower part of my stomach on my sides that really hurts. is this one of the side effects of this drug?  thank you","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM. Thanks for the query.This is not a common side effect of pravastatine and I think you should try to find another cause of your symptoms. it can be caused by gynaecoliguc issues or bowe issues such as IBD,gastritis or inflammatory bowel diseases. You can also try to switch antilipemic but as I said it is not likely caused by parvassttine.Wish you good health. Regards"},{"Patient":"Hello,I am a 21 year old female.

Am taking tablets tegretal 200 3 times aday , gabatin 400 3 times a day and duzela 20 2 times a day from last 4 years but still I have stiffness andvpain on my face. Pls give me your advice Regards, Mrs. Arpita.","Doctor":"Hello, i have gone through your question and understand your concern.Facial pain is a debilitating type of pain, but it does not come from your facial nerve but from the trigeminal nerve. Anyway, you are already on full drug treatment. You might increase the tegretol dose but this might have some adverse. The next step in my opinion is injectingf glicerol in the trigeminal gangion, which is a minimally invasive treatment with good outcomes, but there is high probability of recurrenceIf this does not help I recommend a cerebral MRI to see if there is a neurovascular conflict of the trigeminal nerve after it leaves the brainstem. In case there is this situation you can do a microvascular decompression, which is very invasive but with a high percentuage of pain relief.Hope this answers some of your questions, please feel free for further questions"},{"Patient":"I just got out of the hospital after being in 3 days after having a seizure. Doctor said it was because I was taking Tramadol. Is that a side effect of Tramadol? I have never had a seizure or have been diagnosed with an illness that causes seizures but I did take a fall will a skull fracture in late 2012","Doctor":"Hello, I have gone through your question and understand your concern.Tramadol can cause seizures as its adverse effect, but this is a very unusual, being reported in less than 1% of its adverse effect.While I would worry abot the skull fracture, which I assume you did exams during hospitalisation. I suppose you did EEG and MRI. If for any reason you did not do these exams you should definitly do these exams.In case these are normal I would still recoMmend starting a AED depending on the type of seizure.Wishing you good health, please feel free to ask further questions"},{"Patient":"I am 26 year old male. 2 months back I found out I have L3L4 slip disc, through MRI, after I noticed numbness below the waistline upto the knees throughout. I am under physiotherapy and slowly recovering from the numbness but the pain is still there. one more problem is that my groin is still numb and I can hardly feel my penis, perineum, anal area, buttocks and scrotum or I should say the sensation has gone down to 50% from normal. Also the erections have become weak. Kindly suggest a line of treatment as I am very much worried about this because I have read L3L4 slip disc causes impotence or ED due to nerve compression. Please help such that I can have a normal sex life.","Doctor":"Hello, I have gone through your questiin and understand your concern. This is very serious. I think your slipped disc causes compression on the dural sac and the nerves in it causing a caudal syndrome, which is a neurosurgical emergency. You should repeat the MRI (remember: a herniated disc may appear smaller on MRI because the exam is done in a clinostatic position) and should have a decompression procedure, at least a micro herniectomy.Wishing you good health, please feel free to ask further questions"},{"Patient":"As far as I know ive always had a large dip in my skull where my soft spot would have been.

Since then ive had a headache, my eyelid hurts to the touch and im seeing shooting white spots fly by. This took place 7hrs ago. Is it possible I may have gotten another concussion?","Doctor":"Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. Headache and visual problems are minor symptoms of  concussion and cannot alon define  concussion. If you had another symptoms (nausea, dizziness, amnesia, loss of consciousness etc) you had concussion too.  However I suggest you to pay attention because repeated concussions may be a serious condition. Hope  this answers your question.

I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, but I don t think that is all that is going on. Some things I have read say that you can have white spots on the brain which I have and when I have issues it seems to be more in my upper arm muscles and then spasms in my legs and feet. Could this be MS?","Doctor":"I am sorry about your troubles. However what do you mean by having spots in your brain, have you had a CT OR MRI? The only way of visualising MS brain lesions is through MRI. As for the physical signs what you mention could be caused by fibromyalgia. Not that I can exclude MS, it's a disease with many ways of presentation according to the affected areas, but it's a diagnosis which is suspected by a careful neurological exam and history taking and confirmed by MRI."},{"Patient":"I have been prescribed Pur-bloka for Familial Tremour but It does not seem to be helping much. Especially in the mornings. I have noticed that if I have a glass or two of wine at lunch time then the tremor almost stops completely but I certainly cannot have wine first thing in the morning.","Doctor":"The way you describe it seems to be a case of benign essential tremor. Propranolol (purbloka) is an adequate treatment, if not effective increasing the dose may be considered but only after consulting your doctor cause it has other effects on cardiovascular and respiratory system.If still not effective or dose can't be increased another valid option is a drug called Primidone."},{"Patient":"neuro leigon found on front right lobe of the brain,fluid found on left mastoid bone in middle ear,chronic sinus tract,these three 3 finding may not be related but woul like to know if left untreated what can i expect as far as mental health ,and congnative abilities what kind of expected response.","Doctor":"I read your question and understand your concern. First, these three may be related to each other or not. A cerebral MRI would help a lot understanding better the nature of the cerebral lesion and its natural history. Of course the pathologic examination (biopsy) would make a definitive diagnosis. The location in case the lesion grows would affect some of your cognitive abilities, such as thinking, reasoning, planning, taking decisions etc.Recommend brain MRI.Wishing you good health, please feel free for any other question"},{"Patient":"The alignment of the lumbar vertebrae is slightly distorted with       grade 1 retrolisthesis of L3 on L4. There are endplate degenerative changes       at L2 and L3. The conus medullaris is at L1. The disc heights are relatively       preserved with decrease in disc signal throughout. On axial imaging: At L1-2, a normal appearance is noted. At L2-3, mild degenerative changes are present with wide patency of the canal and foramina. At L3-4, again mild degeneration is present with no significant affect on the canal or foramina. At L4-5, a global disc bulge is present with bilateral extension and associated facet and ligamenta flava hypertrophy. There are possibly inflammatory changes in the facet joints at this level. The spinal canal is moderately reduced and there is some moderate reduction of both foramina. At L5-S1, there is a global disc bulge with associated facet hypertrophy resulting in mild spinal canal and bilateral foraminal narrowing. IMPRESSION: Overall moderate spondylitic changes. No frank evidence of radicular compression. YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. Moderate spondylotic changes mean there is a degenerative disc and vertebral column disease from aging spine, inflammatory processes, or posture and weight. I think listhesis on L3-L4 needs further examination with plain radiographs of your lumbar column in neutral, flexed and extended position to evaluate the real listhesis grade. You need proper treatment to stop advancing of spinal canal narrowing. For this I suggest to consult a Neurologist  and discus treatment modalities. Hope this answers your question.

First you should consult the surgeon who performed the procedure to assure you that the approach he used did not interfere with this nerve.

What about her daughter - is there something she can be doing to stop or at least slow down the progression?","Doctor":"I am sorry but I'm afraid there is no specific therapy for the disease itself. Therapy is more oriented towards preventing and treating orthopedic complications and physiotherapy.

Nothing triggered it to happen today although I did have some alcohol last night if that may have caused any problems.I am currently traveling and am in Turkey. Am wondering if this could be serious enough to go to hospital or what it is or what may be causing it? Any advice would be very helpful thank you!","Doctor":"Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. MDMA is a subtype of amphetamine and drug speed as well is amphetamine, both of which interfere with epinephrine and serotonine reuptake, causing the symptoms you had due to a probably high blood pressure or due to dehydration becuase these cause an increase of diuresis.By now you should have eliminated these substances from your blood, so your headache should not be a conseguence. It is more probable that beer has caused it.Still, if it gets worse or persists in the following days, you should definitely ask for further examinations.Hope this answers your question.

So my question is how does smoking Marijuana affect his health and his shunt? Is it harmful?","Doctor":"Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns.In my opinion if shunt does not work and your bf is well beside the headache it means that the Cerebrospinal fluid somehow has found a way to get absorbed.

The information you have so far is very vague and does not specify what kind of lesion is in raport to the spinal structures, especially the dural sac. Is it extradural or intradural? Each option has different radiologic differentional diagnosis.Since there are sensorimotor and peroneal involvement, it means that this mass or tumor (which means tumefaction from the latin, so not neccessary a malignancy) is compreesive to the neuro structure. Thus, reasonable to decompress these structure, remove as much as you can, and the most important clue in my opinion is to have a pathological examination of the mass, which would make a definite diagnosis, answering you on the prognosis.Hope this answers your question.

While dilated ventricles is a direct consequence of this atrophy. While dementia is a clinical diagnosis, it is quite always associated with some brain atrophy.The only reason why you should seek for a specialist consult is first because you are 57 yrs old, but the most important concern, is your memory problems. In my opinion you should do some memory testing, begining with a MMSE, and annual follow ups.

In case it results normal I would do some blood test, and ask the anesthesist of the last surgery what substances did he use during surgery, and search for their tracks in the blood.Hope this answers your question.

Thanks","Doctor":"Hello dear,The symptoms as mentioned in your post is attributed to accumulation of gas secondary to increased acid production in the stomach.Symptomatic relief can be obtained with intake of Pantoprazole preparation (to be taken twice a day before meals) & antacid gel (to be taken after meals).They prevent formation of excess acid in the stomach & provide symptomatic relief.And it is also needed that you take certain precautions regarding your diet & lifestyle, such as:1. Take soft, plain, non-spicy foods2. Drink lots of water to maintain adequate hydration3. Avoid fast foods & gas producing food products like cabbage, etc.4. Avoid smoking & alcohol.5. Keep away stress, think positive.There is no need to worry, you will be fine.Wishing a good health.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi...my name is Brenda. In August 2012, I suffered a massive stroke, at our local hospital they found I had a ruptured brain aneurysm and two unruptured aneurysm. After two days there I was transported by ambulance to Buffalo, 207 miles away. I underwent four major brain surgeries in thirty-six hours. The ruptured aneurysm was clipped and the other two were coiled. I have had three or four CT scans since. The doctors here say everything is ok but on an appointment in Buffalo with my neurosurgeon in November 2012, said I had a brain tumor.....no one here sees a brain tumor and I am doing good. Are the CT scans reliable and what do I need to know about the coils","Doctor":"I have gone thriugh your question abd understand your concern.The treatment you got is excellent. This means that you are totally out of risk for any further hemorrhagic stroke. If the doctors see nothing but coils on the CT you should be quite sure that there is nothing to worry about. Of course, an MRI would   be a better exam than CT to be 100 % sure.To date, there is no evidence that titanium clipps used for surgery, nor the coils, are related to any tumor transformation. It means that the percentuages that you a brain tumor (cinsidering the treatment and the CT scans performed) are equal to anyone else.Hope this answers your question.

The strategy management of small aneurysms (less than 7 mm) consist on a angio CT per year to see the dimensions of the aneurysm, which in case they stay identical no treatment is recommended.Regarding the therapy I suppose the doctor saw that you are quite anxious, thus he prescribed the above mentioned ones, which in fact can cause the lighheadness as adverse effect, but the aneurysm is not associated to this, nor to the headache, unless it is a hyperintense hyperacute kind of headache. In that case you should take emergent medical consult.Basically, I would recommend to change your medication for your anxiety and assure you the aneurysm you have is not responsable for none of these symptoms.Hope this answers your question.

Over the past week I have had many symptoms. ie headache, dizziness, changes in vision, have sore neck and have felt faint all week. I went to ER and got an updated CT scan that showed no growth in the size. How successful is the surgery to remove these types of cyst s?","Doctor":"Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns.First of all arachnoid cyst are not uncommon and they are benign.Over the years different surgical techniques have been applied to remove or drain somehow the cyst and the result were disappointing reapect to the natyral history of these benign lesions. The main reason why are these cysts removed is headache, but there is no evidence that headache is related to the cyst. Furthermore, the headache does not disappear after cyst removal. The recurrence of cyst formation remains high. The only reasonable indication for surgery is cyst dimenaion growth. So basically if your cyst, which probably is an incidental finding, remains the same, do not worry about, and dont think of surgery, because it will not take your headache away. Just have an MRI every two to three years to check the dimension, and avoid head contact activities or sports, because it has been releated with higher incidence of subdural hematomas in pts harboring a arachnoid cyst.Hope this answers your question.

The reason is quite simple. While most of the blood is directed to the skin to make the thermoregulation in front of the change of temperature due to the hot water, there remains less blood to supply the brain, thus experiencing a faint like episode. If you had a meal before the bath, some blood goes to the digestive system, extracting from the necessary ammount to supply the brain. So dont worry. Dont eat before the bath.

Also a few small FLAIR hyper intense lesions are seen in the deep white matter regions of the cerebral hemispheres. The largest in the right occipital lobe measures 4mm","Doctor":"Hi I have gone through your question and understand your concern.The generalized frontal volume loss is a normal finding on MRI in people over 60 yrs old, while the enlarged ventricles are a normal consequence. The chronic microvascular ischemia is a general term given to the multiple hyperintensities seen in the white matter on T2 and Flair sequences. These have been corelated to uncontrolled high blood pressure, but not a specific brain pathology itself, rather a consequence of bad treatment of bp. I recommend a cardiologic evaluation of your blood pressure and appropriate treatment (remember: half of the hypertensive people get no treatment, and half of those who get treatment are treated bad)You should also take a MMSE (mini mental state exam) by a neurologist for the frontal volume loss because sometimes it may be associated to early signs of Alzheimer disease.Hope this answers your question.

Trauma is one of the causes of disc bulge and cervical bone spurs, so the answer to your question is yes. Other causes are aging spine processes, arthritis, column degenerative disease. If the symptoms you describe started after trauma, this is a additional factor of trauma damage. Tratment is conservative (NSAID drugs, physical therapy, cervical collar, rest) if the symptoms or their impact to your activity are mild, and surgical if the symptoms are severe, there is failure of conservative treatment, or they interfere with your living.

Its a kind of wound in the rectum which gives lots of pain when passing the stool. However it is not characteristic to have lower abdominal pain with this issue.As fissure is usually caused by constipation, this seems your main problem. Constipation can be caused by bad diet, hypothyroidism, medicines (ca-blockers, antidepressants) or colon cancer.Tiredness, heavy eyes feeling can be also caused by hypothyroidism.Dizziness and tiredness are also present with low hemoglobin due to colon cancer.That is why, I suggest you to visit your doctor once again. Blood work, thyroid tests and abdominal ultrasound should be done at first.If you are older than 50, colonoscopy is strongly advisable.If you are young person, please consult general surgeon and have rectal examination.To improve fissure condition and make it go away please follow this steps:- increase fiber rich products and mineral water intake- start probiotic supplementation- do not push hard on stool- wash your rectum after every stool- have sit baths with Oak Bark twice a day- ask you doctor about Nitroglycerine cream Hope this will help.Regards."},{"Patient":"i have nerve pain on the tip of my left elbow.

It tends to be central and does not compress the nerve roots to cause symptoms. The small hernieted disc is a common finding as well, with several studies reported to be found up to 27% of the spinal mri-s with no treatment indication. Still, those in the recess (lateral) can cause nerve root compression because there is less space for the nerve to tolerate any compression. But, for this condition to need any treatment there ahould be specific signs associated with this hd. Since your hernieted disc is paracentral I would not consider it to cause any problem.

I would recommend a ElectroEncephalogram since you are in the last weeks prior to delivery, to see any anormal brain electric activity but it won't exclude any problem in case it results normal. If EEG is normal, deliver the baby and then do a cranial MRI. If the EEG is not normal or you experience again the same shaking I would highly recommend to do a cranial MRI.Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing you and your baby good health."},{"Patient":"The past couple of days when I move just right or if I lie down and am facing up I get really bad motion sickness.

Had an MRI on July 21st...Here are the findings: There is a focus of the T2 bright signal demonstrated in the subcortical white matter of the left frontal lobe. This measures approx 4 mm in diameter. The findings are nonspecific, although in a 45 year old woman do include demyelinating and disc spinous processes such as multiple scierosis. EDEM, vasculitis, or Lyme disease can give similar appearance. Small vessel ischemic change is also possible. Diffusion weighted sequences are unremarkable without an acute process seen. The ventricles are normal in size and configuration. The orbit and paranasal sinuses are within normal limits.

Your symptom is a bit of an odd one but could be a description of something referred to as vertigo which properly defined is that of a spinning sensation but in other contexts it could be any abnormal sense of movement that a person has.  There is also an entity called BPPV or Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo which is commonly suggested when a person tells us that there is an odd sense of movement (especially VERTIGO) when there is a change in direction of the head.  In your case, you're changing direction while walking.You really would need a more thorough neurological examination and history taking to see what else could be going on in order to nail this thing down a bit more precisely.  So long as you haven't fallen or hurt yourself suffered nausea, vomiting, or ringing in the ears recently then, this symptom may be benign and subside.If you feel this information is useful to you would you consider giving a STAR rating to the response I've given?

The prognosis would depend on the damage sustained by the nerve. If the nerve is intact and the problem is compression, decompression can be done may be with surgery.

It started small but has gotten larger...I initially thought it to be a pimple but I tried to squeeze it and nothing came out. I also tried hot compresses but to no avail. It doesn t bother me at all except that it is there and is causing me stress and anxiety. When I press on it, it moves around under my skin. What could it be?","Doctor":"Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. In my opinion the lump is probably atheroma, a benign skin lesion of the sebaceous gland, usualy indolent and slowly getting bigger.

Passing out or faint has two major causes: 1. Syncope caused by hypotension or low brain blood perfusion.2. Seizures or abnormal electrical brain discharge. In both cases I suggest you to consult your primary care Doctor and to discus examinations needed to diagnose the cause. Tgese include regular periodic measures of your blood pressure, EEG ( electroencephalogram) to check out seizure activity and blood glucose lab test to check for hypoglycemia ( low blood sugar).

If the bulging is compressing your lumbar spine and nerves, then it may cause your symptoms, especially if you have a narrow lumbar canal.

A few days ago, it opened and my symptoms began to subside and improved. The doctors so not see a connection here because I guess nothing has shown upon the MRI s.

A pilonidal cyst or sinus is a cyst in the lowest part of column or in tailbone area. It may contain inside hair or skin remnants. Treatment is surgery under local anesthesia. Usualy there is no connection between the cyst and neurological symptoms. However there are isolated cases reported of sacral or lumbar osteomyelitis and epidural abscess  as a complication of pilonidal cyst. I suggest you to discus with your Doctor the possibility of plain radiographs of your lumbosacral column. I also suggest to treat the cyst surgically, it is a simple procedure under local anesthesia.

Last month the neurosurgeon(one who stopped the medicines previously) has asked to reduce the intake to twice a week, monday and thursday. And this month he told that this medicine has to be stopped.

Neurosurgeon is telling this medicine might become poisonous to him if eaten more than a year. Am between the neurosurgeon and neurologist. Please help!","Doctor":"There are many people who take that drug for many years if not for their whole life. So unless the neurosurgeon has seen a side effect which you don't mention I don't agree with the statement that \\"it becomes poisonous\\". If on the other hand your father is experiencing a side effect or has other medical issue which render him prone to bleeding (cause main side effect is bleeding) then of course it's another matter and the risks should be weighed. It definitely doesn't make any sense to take the drug only twice a week.I think it was correct to have interrupted the drug the first time, usually treatment with blood thinner after cerebral venous thrombosis is interrupted after 6 months. However since the venous thrombosis reoccurred that means your father has a prothrombotic condition so continuing it now makes more sense to me.I see you mention Epsolin but that is a drug of a different class, it is used to prevent seizures while Acitrom is a blood thinner so I don't understand that part of your story, hope you gave us all the facts right.

She lives out of state with my sister and my sister said the doctor didn t seem overly concerned other than the fact of her getting surgery at her age . My question is how bad is this, They said it was a small one but they have to relieve the pressure . She has been losig her balance a lot over the last few months and falling. Other than that her health is very good. She had surgery a few month ago to clear blockage in her carotid artery. She is a former smoker but relatively good health.","Doctor":"Well the surgical procedure is a fairly easy one and since they say it's a small bleed chances are it has not caused severe permanent damage to the brain. Of course they mention her age as the main issue because old people carry a higher complication risk for any type of surgery especially with general anesthesia, respiratory complications, infections, thrombosis etc. Hopefully that won't be her case, but doctors have to inform you of any possible scenario."},{"Patient":"I tried flying a glider this past weekend. We were gliding at 2500-3000 feet . I started to feel a bit light headed and noticed back sweats. By opening the vent and getting a rush of cold air on my hand I was able to direct that air on my face which seemed to help. I want to do more gliding but not until I find out why this occurred. ideas? ps- I am a T8-10 Paraplegic","Doctor":"Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. There are two possible conditions that may cause your symptoms:1. Altitude sickness 2. Postural hypotension.Postural hypotension is the possible cause only if you were doing fast maneuvers with glider. Most possible cause is altitude sickness that occurs mainly in highs > 6000 ft. but can occur in lower highs.I think in your case your symptoms are result of a combination of two conditions mentioned above. If you do gliding next time, I recomend you a good rehidration with plenty of fluids in the day and hours before you start gliding. Hope this answers your question.

It came back negative. Could this mastoid problem be the reason I am off balance and have slurred speech? Also what will they do at my appt. I have scheduled with an ent dr?","Doctor":"no.Ear problems can cause balance problems (like room spinning) because the brain gets a signal from the ear and another (different) signal from what the eyes see. BUT, this does NOT cause discoordination. Neither with how the hands can grab, nor with speech. With any new neurologic problem one would usually get an exam of the nervous system, and a brain imaging study (generally an MRI). There can be other studies to look at the vessels and blood flow to the brain and checking for epilepsy. Probably also other checks (blood tests) for other autoimmune diseases."},{"Patient":"I have been on IV clindamycin 1800mg/d5wx22 price/ml for an infection was on it 6 days and now they have me on pill form teva-clindamycin 300mg and teva-clindamycin 150mg. 1 capsul every 6 hours and same with the other one total of 8 pills per day.

Sure - you need to stop the pills immediately start on Ranitidine / PPI, antacid and consult your Doctor immediately. You may need an urgent Upper GI Endoscopy to rule out the gastritis or an ulcer.

Brushed myself off and walked on down to the nearest clinic where I had my head bandaged since the cut wasn.t that deep. Everything was fine until i tried to sleep and I started to have bed spins. I tried to stay on the bed spin position it goes away after a while but it feels quite bad. Is that normal? I even had myself checked by the doctors, No concussions, no severe bleeding, no dizzyness on spot. I could even ride my bike to the nearest hospital in ease. Now my neck hurts bad, but I dont mind that, figured it was just a sprain since the pain is not central and not in all positions. However I am worried about the bed spins, do they go away with time?

I think you need plain radiographs of your cervical column to chech for/ rule out any bone damage or instability. If there are no such damages, then it is soft tissue contusion or traction (whiplash), bed rest for couple of days and a cervical collar should help to relieve your pain. If there are any damages in plain radiographs and your pain persists, I suggest you to consult your primary care Doctor. Hope this answers your question.

It was quite a strong voltage (sparks were visible to others). I felt a little off after, but that went away after a day or so. However, 5 days later, I am still experiencing pain in my right arm. Should I see a doctor? Why is this occurring?","Doctor":"Sorry this happened to you but what likely happened is that you're suffering from what is known as an electrocution form of neuropathy which can be very painful.  The high voltage that struck you or contacted you has altered your peripheral nerve's sensory function (like overloading a circuit that trips the breaker--  sometimes the circuit breaker protects the wires downstream....but sometimes the charge is big enough so that even if the breaker trips everything downstream still gets hit).  So, I would recommend getting to a neurologist if the pain has not disappeared by now so they can get on top of whatever treatment they feel is indicated early rather than late otherwise the problem could be chronic and convert into something referred as chronic complex regional pain syndrome.If you would like to ask me any other questions DIRECTLY about this subject please feel free to use the following link and pose your question: this informatioin is useful to you please consider a STAR RATING which would be greatly appreciated."},{"Patient":"Hello!

I think the problem you describe may be a syncope or vertigo. If you were tired, stressed out, didn't sleep well, etc. then probably was syncope.

If  your cousin is diagnosed with brain death ( there are examinations that determine it, EEG, cerebral and brainstem reflexes absent, etc.) then his heart can beat for a indefinite time if there is medical support, if no his heart will stop soon. The time that human brain resists without oxygen is 3 to 5 minutes, beyond this time (without blood and oxygen) happens brain death and if the diagnosis is correct there is nothing to do to help him.

His surgeon is suggesting surgery to open windows in his skull so that the brain can expand. I am afraid he will be worse off, though he is having severe, severe headaches. I would like to know is this is a proceedure done to adults?","Doctor":"Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. Treatment of slit ventricle syndrome is difficult, the options are : anti- migraine drugs, change of the ventricular catheter and change of shunt valve with a programmable valve, temporary block of shunt to expand ventricles, if there is aqueduct stenosis needs to be done endoscopic third ventriculostomy. In some cases needs to be done shunt configuration draining both ventricles and basal cisterns. Subtemporal decompression (windows of scull) is rarely done because improvements are short- lived.Hope this answers your question.

Since then 3 more of these episodes have happened exactly the same symptoms and onset of this and I've had to be hospitalised until I am better. On each occasion a different doctor gives a different diagnosis, appendicitis and one suggested I must learn to live with the pain as all my tests are normal. I have had 3 ultrasounds that have came back normal, one showed a femoral hernia, however there is no pain in the groin and the surgeon assumes it's a red herinh. I have had internal scans for ovarian cysts and endometriosis, these have came back clear. Recently, I went to hospital following online advice when a bowel movement contained an orange grease like substance, this was present with and without stools for 3 days. I have also recently had severe constipation and bloating which I have never had before, I'm having a lot of pain on my right pelvic side and this is at any level of movement, it is especially sore whilst I urinate or pass stools. Any information or guidance would be great. Just wondering if there's something that's being missed. :) thanks!","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for the query.Your symptoms should force surgeon to perform appendectomy. Even if the appendix will occur healthy, this will finally rule this out. This is the first thing which should be done as your symptoms along with right lower abdominal pain are enough to remove appendix. Antibiotics can cure some part of appendicitis, but it can come back. And when it does, should be removed.I suggest you to consult a surgeon, ask him to do diagnostic laparoscopy with appendectomy. Other thing is your hernia. Please not the hernia is the most common reason of bowels obstruction. So if this hernia is on the right side, it should be fixed.Hope this will help.Regards."},{"Patient":"i have a 69 year old aunt who went into hospital with a virual infection and now has been told she has opsoclonus mycolonus syndrome the hospital have admitted they havent a clue as this is so rare, she is now presently on a ventilater, highly sedated & on a lot of treatments. we are also in the dark","Doctor":"Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. Opsoclonus/ myoclonus syndrome  is a rare neurological disorder of unknown causes which appears to be the result of an autoimmune process involving the nervous system.

Syncope happens mostly due to abnormal ( low) blood flow to brain from different reasons ( cardiac, loss of blood vessel tone etc.) mainly during stress, fatigue, very high or very low temperatures, or low blood sugar. The fourth time seems more like seizure, so I suggest you to visit a Neurologist and a Cardiologist to discus the cause of your black out. Hope this answers your question.

Acuostic neuroma is a benign tumor arising from nerve sheath of VIII- th cranial nerve occurring commonly at cerebello-pontine angle, vestibular neuritis is viral infection of the VIII-th nerve. Both have similar symptoms( disfunction of VIII-th nerve) but acoustic neuroma has also symptoms related to mass effect on brain structures. They are easely distinguishable on MR imaging (diffusion restriction signal in vestibular neuritis, acoustic neuroma grows into cerebello-pontine angle and is definitely bigger than the swelling of the nerve etc.) Hope this answers your question.

The treatment ( surgery or conservative), will depend on imaging studies and your symptoms ( i. e. if you have only back pain or pain that radiates in one leg or both, if you have urination problems or not).

That test revealed 50% plus blocked external right carotid artery. Any thoughts on the pain/tenderness issues.","Doctor":"I don't think you should worry,  at least regarding the arteries. If there had been any other issue with the artery that sonogram is precisely the exam which would have shown it. The 50% stenosis is not alarming (especially if your age is advanced it's a frequent finding) it's the internal carotid we are more concerned with as it could be a source of stroke. Of course if the pain persists you should be checked, might be related to other structures like muscles, joints etc. It's not related to MRI though, many people suffer some anxiety issues during/after MRI it's normal with the confined space and all that noise, nothing to worry though."},{"Patient":"I m a 52 yr old healthy female, 5 6 150lbs who runs 3-4 miles, 3-4 times weekly. no smoking, drugs or alcohol use. not on any medications.

I Had catscan, mri, echocardiogram , carotid ultrasound, all negative in 3 day stay. diagnosis of bell s palsy put on antiviral and steriod for 7 days as well as trigeminal neuralgia put on tegretol 100 mg twice daily. now my bp continues to be 150 s / 90 s, constant pain in face, jaw. It seems as if nerve compression somewhere (4 & 5 vertabrae degenerative disc disease managed with an occasional Aleve) is causing more pain. Is this possible? Should I be on high blood pressure meds? I see my medical doctor on tomorrow and the neurologist next Thursday","Doctor":"I understand that you must be worried. From the signs and symptoms only, it would seem something more than simply Bell palsy. The good news is that you seems to have undergone a pretty comprehensive evaluation in the hospital and everything has been normal. Had it been a compression of the nerves from a tumor, an aberrant blood vessel or other focal brain lesion it would've been spotted on the MRI, so while I understand that your symptoms are very disturbing, more than usual in these cases, perhaps in the setting of a viral infection, I believe it will gradually improve.Regarding the blood pressure, yes looking at those figures you should have medication. Of course you should monitor it, if it was normal before perhaps factors like stress due to your complaints and steroid treatment have played a role in increasing it and you may reduce the treatment in the future, but for now it seems necessary."},{"Patient":"What is the procedure for treating a brain bleed after a person has awoken from a diabetic coma. This is day five. Xeralto was stopped, but a heart defect is in play. Second CT Scan performed, doctor s believe she is having seizures. Is this from the imbalance from such high blood glucose levels. When first found she was over 800 and life flighted to a trauma center. Maybe have initially been down for 12 hours.","Doctor":"Since she's been flown to a trauma center I'm supposing she had some kind of injury as well and that's what caused the bleeding (facilitated by Xarelto). It's not caused directly by the high blood glucose level, perhaps indirectly she fell due to the high glucose and hit her head (just speculating as you don't give more details on the circumstances).As for the treatment of the bleeding, it depends also on location. At times one could have surgery, but only in selected locations and bleeding types and when an anticoagulant like Xarelto is involved surgeons are very cautious. If she's in a trauma center I suppose she has been evaluated and surgery has not been considered useful.If surgery is not an option then there is no specific treatment for the bleeding, it's mainly a question of supporting therapy, treating complications like high blood glucose, infections, controlling blood pressure, anti-epileptics for seizures and so on according to each patient's individual problems. The bleeding if not causing deadly complications will be gradually absorbed over weeks and the outcome will depend on how big it was and what permanent damages it left behind. Physiotherapy will be needed as well."},{"Patient":"i had concussion 6 days ago, motorcycle accident where i was knocked out for a couple of hours. i signed myself out the hospital the same day, have been resting and sleeping most of the time. yesterday and today i had to walk/take public transportation for hours, and all of a sudden im getting a fever. should i be worried that this may be related the concussion i had?","Doctor":"No I don't think that the two things are related.

One of the most common causes, probably also your case, is a herniated disc, meaning that the discs which reside between your vertebrae due to degenerative changes of the vertebral column can dislodge and compress the neighboring nerve roots and the spinal cord and it probably will require surgery.However since you have not been given any more details, I don't know whether this is your case, because there might also be other rarer causes like fractures, tumor, infection etc. Since it's compressing the spinal cord it's probable you'll need surgery though."},{"Patient":"Hello.. sir before three years i was suffer from brain tuberculomas after diagnosis i had completed 18 month treatment on it but now agains some difficultise like Headake and fever during morning is begining againg. so please give me sugest me treatment.","Doctor":"You should get to your doctor immediately for more studies.

I am in rewa(mp), I have my brother who is suffering from epilepsy from a quite long time (around 16 years). In childhood he slipped on a stone during playing cricket. After one month we realized that he is suffering from fits. During those days we showed him to local good neurosurgeon, he took care of him but we didn t get any development in his injury. After that when fits were continuously coming twice in a month. My father took it very seriously n showed him to another neurosurgeon in jabalpur, he referred my brother for CT scan. We did whatever he said, we followed his course of tegritol n other medicines for around 3-4 years but didn t get better results. Meanwhile we took a appointment in AIIMS Delhi, there also we showed his results and as per docters advice we did his ECG. We followed AIIMS doctor course for around 4-5 years but also didn t get any results. Meanwhile my brother who was taking around 900 mg medicines on a daily basis was felt very week in his studies.

MY PCP DOCTOR HAS TOLD ME THAT THIS IS JUST PART OF MY SKULL , BUT IT DOES NOT SEEM RIGHT TO ME TO HAVE THESE SYMPTOMS. PLEASE HELP!","Doctor":"Hi, If I were your treating Doctor for this case, I would ask for imaging study of your brain, (CT scan, MR scan). The symptoms you have are not related directly to lumps. If there is no pathological process of your brain after imaging, then you can peace your mind and deal with lump problem in tranquility. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions."},{"Patient":"I am 42 years old.

It's the stroke which causes her condition not the surgery itself, without it she probably wouldn't have survived. Unfortunately it seems that 4 years have passed and if your wife is still unresponsive I am afraid that there is little chance of her neurological condition improving. The damage has been very extensive and whatever compensation from the unaffected areas there could have been hoped for at first, it would have taken place during the first year."},{"Patient":"I have been experiencing severe memory loss, loss of concentration, cannot focus on every day tasks, and had an auditory hallucination.

Unable to fall back asleep it hurt so bad....took a bunch of ibuprofen and eventually fell back asleep. When I woke up in the morning my hand feels like it had fallen asleep and tingled for quit awhile before going away. What is causing this?","Doctor":"Hello dear,The symptoms as mentioned in your post can be attributed to:1. Paraspinal spasm & compression of nerve fibers at the Cervico-dorsal region or due to compression of nerve secondary to improper sleeping posture.2. Inadequate hydration status & electrolyte imbalance of the body3. Dietary deficiencies of certain nutrients like Iron, Calcium, Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, Folic acid, etc. which help in blood formation & nerve conduction.4. Peripheral neuropathy caused due to any fluctuation in blood pressure or blood sugar level.Symptomatic relief can be obtained by intake of nervigenic agents (like Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, Folic acid) as well as multivitamin & multimineral supplements including iron, calcium & Vitamin D needs to be added in your diet.If symptoms still persist, kindly consult a Neurologist & get a complete Neurological examination done.Certain investigations like complete blood count, serum electrolyte estimation, fresh estimation of blood pressure & blood sugar levels & nerve conduction studies will be helpful to rule out any pathological cause for the symptoms.Wishing you a Good Health.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi. I had an MRI performed and the conclusion was: Single sub centimeter T/2FLAIR hyper intense focus in the left frontal peri ventricular white matter. Differential diagnostic considerations include a single demylwlineating focus versus sequels of small vessel ischemic disease. Clinical correlation recommended. 2. Otherwise, negative non contrast MRI evaluation of the brain. What does this mean? My doc basically sent me to the cardiologist for further treatment. I had fainted for the first time in my life was why the testing was done. Thank you for your time.","Doctor":"It would be useful if you told us your age as well. The older you are the more likely is small vessel ischemic disease rather than a demielinating focus.Demielinating diseases are a group of diseases of which the most famous is multiple sclerosis, highly unlikely if you are over 45, so since your doctor seems not to think that is the diagnosis I won't elaborate more.By sequel of small vessel ischemic disease, it means a small stroke, what we call a lacune. It means a small blood vessel is narrowed till it was closed and the small brain area it supplied was damaged due to lack of blood. In itself it may bring no major consequences if not in a critical area, but small vessel disease is almost always a more spread disease, meaning more blood vessels can be affected and cause accumulative damage over time. There are multiple causes of small vessel disease, but in most people the main culprit are factors like high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol, obesity. So the best preventive treatment is addressing these issues and also take low dose aspirin daily.I don't know why you've been sent to the cardiologist, perhaps to be evaluated for your blood pressure, or perhaps to check for a cardiac origin of your fainting, like abnormalities of heart rhythm or other heart structural abnormalities.I don't think the fainting was directly caused by that brain focus, it is an incidental finding."},{"Patient":"I have previously been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease, several diffused and bulging discs, spinal stenosis and a tumor on l1.

What doe these test results mean?","Doctor":"You should say also what was the motive for performing this MRI and the 2009 one, what are the symptoms their progression in time, prior illnesses. The MRI report alone is not enough and the following is just assumptions.As for the report alone, if you were younger it would be suspicious for a demielinating disease like MS, but at 68 while not impossible it is not likely to be the case so I wouldn't be alarmed. The other possibilities refer to the remains of an old process the origin of which in the absence of other data can not be determined whether stroke, infection or something else (like an old scar). It's not active though so this option is not alarming either. Of course the report wisely recommends to compare with old MRI, if the lesion was present there as well and has not changed that renders MS or any active disease even less likely. A follow up MRI is suggested for the same reason to see if things remains unchanged or if there are new signals in other areas of the brain or spinal cord which would indicate an active process."},{"Patient":"I was told that I might have possible ideopathicpolyneuropathy.

I was hospitalized for 7 days. During this period of time, I had my gallbladder removed as well since it showed it had gone bad. I have been well for 7 months. This past Sunday, my stomach started having contractions, spasms, whatever you want to call it. I was in horrible pain. But I went to sleep and woke up fine. On this past Monday, woke up fine, and about 3:00 pm it hit again. I was in so much pain, I started vomiting. I barely made it through the evening. I woke up Tuesday morning and was fine again. I made it thru Tuesday to today. I was fine all day until around 4:00 pm, The spasms started and I had to run to the bathroom for a bowel movement. I feel some relief but I am still having minor contractions and waves of pain. My GI doctor gave me an RX of Levsin/SL 125 MG, last year, but I have never taken the medication. I am wondering if I can take it now. I took Prilosec this morning and Zantac this afternoon around 4:00 pm. It is now 6:08 pm. I also take the drug Spironolactone and Kflex (an antiobiotic).

Surely you can take Levsin as you are in a pain.From your history I can decipher  that you may probably be suffering from an intestinal infection or some sort of sub-acute obstruction.

The next wake-up time, it was finally daylight, I was groggy, my eyes continued to move back and forth as before, not being able to focus, it was like my eyes were completely out of control, very tired, no energy, dehydrated, and barely moving. I do believe I had a fever. Later that morning, I was able to scoot myself up enough to reach my phone and call my daughter. She came over right away, but I was unable to get out of bed. I waited until Sunday to go to the ER. The only thing they could tell me was, my potassium was a little low, all other blood work seemed fine, I had a fever of 103.3, vomiting, diarrhea. Diagnosed with a viral infection and sent home. Since then, I have lost 12 lbs from basically not eating, I have kept as much Gatorade down as I can possibly take, and I have not felt right since. It has now been 10 days since the incident and I am still not up to par. Still barely eating, but keeping up with the fluids. I have had diarreah up until last Saturday when it subsided. I do have abdominal cramping at times, but I contributed that to nothing in the bowel. I am a diabetic, I have thyroid disease (hypo), gerd, and gastroparisis. Any clues? Thanks!

Cysts can recur when only cyst aspirtation is done and this can cause further development of the cyst even in 6 years after aspiration. Presently the cyst area can be filled with an inert material like teflon and this prevents the cyst from growing again. Another treatment for such cysts is a cysto-peritoneal shunt may be require to definitively treat the cyst. This allows flow of cyst fluid from the cyst into the abdominal cavity, thereby relieving decompressing the cyst and relieving pressure on the surrounding structures"},{"Patient":"When I get up fast or move my head too fast, I feel something shifting inside of my head, and as it does, there is a swirling dizzines that accomplanies it, whether my eyes are open or closed.

If very severe pain due to autonomic nervous system imbalance where in you try to resist pain there may be chance of variation in bowel movement, constipation.It is very difficult to tell the cause without complete examination. Since abdominal pain in appendix area, nausea with constipation I advice you to get done USG abdomen and pelvis once to rule out appendicitis or any bowel obstruction. For pain you can take NSAID like ibuprofen and get evaluated for cause of sciatica and get treated for it. This may relieve all your symptoms.Regards"},{"Patient":"hi my name is trice and for the past years ive notice a dent going down the middle of my skull i thought it was from pulling my hair to tight but now i jus dnt know I was in a lot of fights doing my childhood where i had my head stumped on and slammed","Doctor":"there are no treatments for this and bone are probably necessary.  when you pass puberty the joints in your skull are fused and there is no more growth.  it is likely that you have had this dent your whole life or the dent you are feeling is actually just a prominent suture which fused.  in any case if it's not causing any problems there is no need to do anything about it"},{"Patient":"I slipped on the ice around 7:40 am eastern time and I hit my head. i got right up no confusion or loss of consciousness.

First, chronic obstructive lung disease which is often found in people with a smoking history or work history in factories and foundries. The condition of the bluish color to the fingers and the nailbeds is referred to as acrocyanosis.Other conditions that can lead to the symptoms you're describing include peripheral vascular problems in terms of blood flow either not sufficiently reaching the fingers are fingertips or if they do there is a severe restriction of blood flow due to contraction of the small vessels feeding the fingers and fingertips..You may also have problems endocrinologic Lee such as low thyroid hormone or low cortisol levels in your bloodstream that can affect blood flow and response of the arterial system to changes.The fact that you have fainted on one occasion raises the possibility that you may have some type of hormonal or vascular imbalance.

Abdominal curl-Place your feet on a wall so that your knees and hips are bent at 90-degree angles. Tighten your abdominal muscles. Raise your head and shoulders off the floor. To avoid straining your neck, cross your arms on your chest rather than locking them behind your head.3. Isometric of back - with hip knee flex, pleace the roll of towel under the low back and press. Hold it 15 counts and relaxdo it for 10 timesAll the exercises do it twice a day. Do not hold your breadth while doing the exercise. 4. Hot water fermentation.

Compression of nerve fibers at the lower limb due to maintaining inappropriate posture.2. Inadequate hydration status & electrolyte imbalance of the body3. Dietary deficiencies of certain nutrients like Iron, Calcium, Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, Folic acid, etc. which help in blood formation & nerve conduction.4. Peripheral neuropathy caused due to any fluctuation in blood pressure or blood sugar level.Symptomatic relief can be obtained by intake of nervigenic agents (like Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, Folic acid) as well as multivitamin & multimineral supplements including iron, calcium & Vitamin D needs to be added in your diet.Physiotherapy & postural exercise will also be helpful.If symptoms still persist, kindly consult a Neurologist & get a complete Neurological examination done.Certain investigations like complete blood count, serum electrolyte estimation, fresh estimation of blood pressure & blood sugar levels & nerve conduction studies will be helpful to rule out any pathological cause for the symptoms.Wishing you a Good Health.Take care."},{"Patient":"I woke up this morning rather dizzy when I opened my eyes and got out of bed.

I am Dr Saumya Mittal, MD.Read your query. That is a very significant question and i appreciate your problem. I will try my best to answer your queryA granuloma is where an infection may have happened once, as your doctor said, in the last 10 years or before. This infection could have been anything like a tuberculosis to maybe some minor lesion. Now the body fights infections on its own. So the infection may have never come to the surface. But the body must have fought off the infection. However some damage may have been left back.Now the body usually responds by depositing calcium in such spots- whether in brain, or in any other body part. This deposition occurs over a long period of time- hence we say maybe the infection occurred 10 years back. The lesion in itself is inactive.The problem however is that it is in brain. So if the lesion is calcified in brain, especially in cortex, it makes her prone to seizures. The brain works on electrical signals. The calcific spot forms a lesion that changes this electrical field and makes it abnormal. This abnormal electrical field may be going on, and may be under control. But with right set of conditions, a seizure can develop-This set of conditions can include-a lack of sleepexcess coffee/teastaring at blinking lights too longtoo long television gazing etcBrain surgery should be avoided as far as possible. However you can discuss with the doctor the need of prophylactic antiepileptic drugs. Personally, I would avoid them till at least the first seizure episode. Before that just avoid the triggers.Testing a Mantoux test, ESR, TB Quantiferon gold test may help.I hope this helps you. Inform the reports mentioned above/if any other so I can be of help further.

I will try my best to answer your queryYours is a condition known as myeloradiculopathy- that means the disorder (pathy) involves the spinal cord (myelo-) and the nerves coming out of it (radiculo-). Your spine is basically a column of bones separated by cartilages with spinal cord running inside this bony column. the nerves come out from the spinal cord and run out to the body through small gaps between the bonesThese cartilages sometimes move from their place. This displacement can be in any direction, but is most prominently and commonly behind. Now when this disc (cartilage) slips behind, it manages to obstruct the gaps through which the nerve comes out. This causes damage to the nerve.If the disc protrudes further, it may start to affect the coverings of the spinal cord (theca)at first, followed by the compression of the spinal cord itself.This is exactly what is happening to you, as per the report entered.ideally, the treatment of this condition is neurosurgical.

You may be seeing symptoms like pain on breathing or laughing.However, let me warn you, there is nothing that can be done for a rib fracture.

However, I can tell you that I am nearly certain your symptoms ARE NOT due to the part of the brain you've been told is shrinking.  They are referring to the cerebellum (that part of your brain where the 2 grapefruits are hanging off the end in back?).  It may appear on a scan of some sort to be smaller in size or volume than what would be considered optimal.  However, unless you've had a previous scan there's almost no way to know for sure if in fact, it IS SHRINKING since there is no comparator film.

I'm a Teetotaler as well, always have been and though I'm not nor have I ever been a professional sportsman I continue to avidly stay in the sport of wrestling entering both collegiate Open and freestyle tournaments.  I'm 10 years your senior and I coach wrestling as well at John Carroll University.Your symptoms are not uncommon under the scenario of a variety of different situations such as dehydration, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), intercurrent illness such as either a respiratory infection, viral syndrome, bladder infection, side effects from new medications, or the interaction between a medicine you have always been taking, and something new, an ear infection (viral or otherwise).Your best bet is to keep yourself well hydrated, water is best, take your temperature, get something substantial to eat instead of being a Toast-totaler in the mornings if your habit is to skip or not have much to eat.  Are you in acceptable physical shape for where you want to be right now in your life.  I don't know which professional sport you are referring but I know they all have their standards of conditioning and fitness while people are actively in the sport Of course, this wanes as we get farther away from the sport and as we age.Notice that I phrased your level of physical conditioning as acceptable FOR WHERE YOU WANT TO BE right now....as opposed to the way you phrased it which was FIT FOR MY AGE.  I would expect a former pro athlete to be FIT for their age AND MUCH MORE in all probability at the age of 44.  But is that WHERE you want to be.  So the coach part of me is telling the COACH part of you that you could probably do better in that department....as can we ALL.I still actively compete in my sport and get head to head with Division I college Bucks....I shouldn't be eating that 1/2 quart of Cookie Butter ice cream I just polished off 10 minutes ago as I began writing this to you....and boy are my kids going to pissed to find it missing from the freezer.

If you have not had a GOOD SOLID physical with some blood work to include cholesterol, thyroid hormones, perhaps even some other hormone checks such as testosterone, cortisol, and so forth, maybe a good screening EKG to be done, and then, a tight neurological assessment (which is my specialty and BIAS to boot!

Paraspinal spasm & compression of nerve fibers at the Cervico-dorsal region2. Inadequate hydration status & electrolyte imbalance of the body3. Dietary deficiencies of certain nutrients like Iron, Calcium, Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, Folic acid, etc. which help in blood formation & nerve conduction4.

I can understand your concerns.Kinetic Tremor: the tremor which occurs during movement of a body part (it could equally be called a movement tremor/action  tremor).Tremors are usually most evident in the hands but may affect the head (‘Titubation’) or other parts of the body.Chiari malformation, also known as Arnold–Chiari malformation, is a malformation of the brain can be associated with a lack of cerebellar development causing in-coordination and tremor.Type III Chiari malformation can be associated with  an occipital encephalocele containing a variety of abnormal neuroectodermal tissues. Occipital encephalocele  can produce a small lump on the back side of the skull (as in your case probably),which can go undetected since birth.Magnetic resonance is considered the best imaging modality for Chiari malformation.Regards Dr. T.K.

He was rushed to the hospital via ambulance, but remembers none of it. Upon ER tests including a cat scan, they diagnosed him with a UTI, and put him on Cipro, and was recommended he make an appointment with a neurologist for an MRI. I was wondering could the UTI have been a cause for the seizure?","Doctor":"Infectious diseases in people over the age of 60-65 are one of the most common causes for seizures or seizure like disorders which occur for the first time as well as changes in mental status in an otherwise healthy individual with no history or cause for problem.  I think that in this case the call is a good one with one single detail that could be problematic for your uncle.  The use of CIPROFLOXACIN.  Cipro as well as all the other antibiotics in this class of drug known as FLUOROQUINOLONES can actually LOWER the thresh hold for seizure activity and therefore, the risk of your uncle having another episode while being treated is higher than if he were on something that did not predispose him to consulsive activity.  If the ER simply put him on the drug without doing a culture and sensitivity then, I would still continue the medication but simply be very aware of this as a risk factor of the drug.  Hopefully, he doesn't need to be on it long.  If they do have a culture and sensitivity on the urine specimen then,  he could find out from the hospital record what other options he has in terms of antibiotics that could be used if he still has to use it for any length of time...again, careful not to choose something that increase his risk for seizures.The idea of a neurologist to visit and follow up with him is also a good one in that I think it's worth while getting a full neurological checkup to make sure we're not simply ascribing these seizures to something obvious like UTI and missing a more insidious or hidden cause that could later come back to cause problems after the UTI is long gone.If you would like to address any other questions regarding this or other matters feel free to look me up directly on this network at the following URL: rate this answer with a STAR RATING of your choice if you believe the information I've provided was of value to the question you posed."},{"Patient":"My husband is 38 years old.

Numbness over 1/2 of your body in know way suggests a circulatory problem.  Therefore, you will not find a single doctor that can give you a good answer if you're expecting to hear that it's in the circulation somewhere...uh uh....What you really need to do is get to a doctor and then, TAKE THEIR ADVICE to be referred to a specialist who can perform studies and tests in order TO KNOW what's going on...guessing on a network like this doesn't do you much good since the information available is incomplete to make a diagnosis and there are literally hundreds (no joke) if not thousands of medical entities that can give a person numbness and tingling over a portion of the body.  So, hazarding a guess here young lady is definitely not to your benefit.  If you take my advice and get to your primary care physician who can decide what the best next step should be and then, bring back information in the way of test results, imaging studies of the head, etc. and upload them, I'd be happy to look at them and help you figure out what's going on if your doctor is stumped.You can look me up at by name (DARIUSH SAGHAFI, MD- Cleveland, Ohio, USA) at:   if you'd like a personal real time webcam consultation which can be done either through videocam (great if you'd like to get a virtual neurological examination done), instant live texting, or audio consultation you can find me on Wed.-Sat's 3a-6a (New York City Time Zone) and Sunday's 11p-3a at:www.healthtap.com/drsaghafiIf this answer has helped you gain a bit more insight (at least in why you SHOULDN'T use the internet to simply LOOK up symptoms) into your question would you consider giving a STAR RATING? That would be truly AWESOME of you and maybe we'll catch each other on the flip soon if you decide you wanna come back and see if I'm really this FUNNY in real life!  ROFLMBO!  Huh???-----  Cheers!  Be good...."},{"Patient":"I am woman, 42 years and sometimes loose consciousness a while. As long as I remember it happened this year only. Once happen in front of a class.

Paraspinal spasm & compression of nerve fibers at the Cervico-dorsal region.2. Inadequate hydration status & electrolyte imbalance of the body3. Dietary deficiencies of certain nutrients like Iron, Calcium, Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, Folic acid, etc. which help in blood formation & nerve conduction.4. Peripheral neuropathy caused due to any fluctuation in blood pressure or blood sugar level.Symptomatic relief can be obtained by intake of nervigenic agents (like Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, Folic acid) as well as multivitamin & multimineral supplements including iron, calcium & Vitamin D needs to be added in your diet.If symptoms still persist, kindly consult a Neurologist & get a complete Neurological examination done.Certain investigations like complete blood count, serum electrolyte estimation, fresh estimation of blood pressure & blood sugar levels & nerve conduction studies will be helpful to rule out any pathological cause for the symptoms.X ray and MRI of Cervico-dorsal region may be required to detect any nerve compression.Wishing you a Good Health.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello, I have been feeling very dizzy for about 3 weeks with some nausea and weird taste on my mouth.

That is a very significant question and i appreciate your problem. I will try my best to answer your queryThere is a strong possibility that the condition may be due to the nerve compression. The nerve damage may cause the symptoms, especially when the muscles are getting affected secondary to the nerve damage.Fluttering may be due to a number of reasons, the most common being fatigue. The fatigue may occur due to any cause. The muscles are basically stressed out. And so when they have to keep contracting and acting, there may be a feeling of flutter.Fluid and electrolyte balance is crucial to smooth acting of the muscles.As depicted, there are too many causes of flutter.

The reason is that when you stand for a long time, blood pools in your legs and the blood flow to your brain is compromised for a short while leading to a black out. When you have this symptom next time , either lie flat or sit down and bend forward so that your face rests on your thighs. The sensation would pass.

I believe that waiting a period of time may be useful because it can give you some idea of the RATE OF GROWTH of this tumor over the next 6-12 months.If you would like to write more specific questions and show me a copy of your scan for another opinion I am happy to do this over this network.  You'd simply have to write your inquiry DIRECTLY  to my attention (DARIUSH SAGHAFI, MD) in the PREMIUM QUESTION SECTION of this network's website.Alternatively, I give live telemedicine consults and can be found at www.healthtap.com/drsaghafi on Wed-Sat. from 3a-6a and Sundays 11p-3a (NEW YORK CITY time zone).  I can do a partial neurological examination on you by webcam, see how you walk, balance, see your eye and tongue movements and a few other things if you'd like.  Then, I could give you a better idea of what might be good to do.Good luck to you.  Would do me a favor and give a STAR RATING TO this question's answer if you find it satisfactory as a response and a little written feedback as to how I did with the answer?"},{"Patient":"I have slight numbness on the left and right side of my neck.

In all honesty, it would be difficult to tell what the exact problem is without a detailed interrogation and examination. I am happy you would soon be evaluated by your doctor. This would be an occasion to gather more information and make a more comprehensive evaluation and propose solutions. I also have the feeling that you are getting too worried by this to the point that it is affecting your normal functioning. It is okay to be concerned but do not let it interfere with your normal functioning. Yes, gastritis and reflux could explain the nausea, but not the head spinning.  A complete evaluation would very much help us here.I hope this helps. I wish you well.

No heavy lifting is involved, I am not participating in any sport, I am not overeaching for anything, nor am I standing in some strange/unusual position....What happens to me is,...I get a totaly unexpected sudden severe pain at the bottom of my back, which I describe to friends as being like someone ramming a sword into the bottom of my spine from the back....As this happens, I fall to the floor, in a way that I can only describe as somebody switching my legs off . When I hit the floor, I know now from previous experiences, to try to lay flat on my back as soon as possible, which makes the hideous pain vanish in seconds. But whilst I try to adjust myself into the flat to the floor position, ALL movement however small, causes me pain equal to that which put me on the floor initialy....I am completely conscious throughout (this isn t some form of fainting )...and can have sensible conversation with anyone present, for the minute or so I stay on the floor, before being helped to my feet....When I am standing up again, there is no hint of pain, and I feel no sense of experiencing anything traumatic.?...I know myself, that it probably wont happen again for another few weeks, and so just carry on with the conversation (or whatever) I was having before it happened.....BUT I KNOW THERE IS SOMETHING NOT RIGHT.??...Can anyone suggest what may be causing this.? P.S. It only happens when in a standing posture.","Doctor":"Hi this may be due to orthostatic hypotension which occours when you stand.and sudden pain in the back once in 6 or 8 weeks may be due to premenstural symptoms.will be better if you consult your physician and ask him to evaluate for you vitamin d lavels calcium lave and have one bone scan done.if everything is normal take some medications prior to the expected date of your menstural cycle to relieve your premenstural symtoms."},{"Patient":"My daughter is 16 with back pain, hip pain and some numbness in feet and hands.

Spinal stenosis is a term for the reduced diameter of the vertebral canal. Vertebral canal is a small tube in which the spinal cord passes. This has become thinner. As per your record, it has started to affect the health of the spinal cord- myelomalacia. At C3-6, it is high enough to cause damage to all 4 limbs. so you may end up with quadriparesis.I hope that explains to you the seriousness of the conditionAlso, I will suggest you decide fast.
