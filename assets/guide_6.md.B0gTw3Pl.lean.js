HELP!","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.This is called evening colic and is quite common in this age group. This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in air too. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief.The two best ways to relieve this distress is -1. Do not put the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2. If still crying - put the baby in prone position and keep patting the back gently so that the baby passes off the flatus and gets relieved.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

I will explain you how a viral illness behaves. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day.If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all.Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

Pulmonary and Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis are equally common in masses. Testicular mass was there and you operated for that also. Now pain is in right hypochondrium and epigastrium  region. These both areas are different from each  from each other but very close to each other  and there is pleural effusion on right side You know that in pleural effusion patient feels pain & threshold of  pain is different in different persons. Aspiration of fluid from pleura will suggest the cause of disease, whether it contains pus or blood. Send this aspirated fluid to lab for its culture both for bacteria and also for drug sensitivity. Here following points are to be noted. ====           In the beginning it was in testicles for which you operated. ====           Pleaural effusion ====           Pain in liver i. e . might be an involvement of liver as cirrhosis of the liver are prone to tubercular peritonitis. Alcoholic liver disease are at an increased risk of tuberculosis ( sorry, but if you are chronic alcoholic please consider this point also). Involvement  of liver is very common in both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. Usually hepatic tuberculosis is clinically silent.In liver tuberculosis we have keep vigilance over formation of granuloma  because these granulomas coalesce to form a large tumour called as tuberculoma. Tuberculomas which has undergone extensive caseating and liquefaction necrosis forms a tubercular abscess,we can call it  HEPATIC TUBERCULOSIS.

Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. One could label it as IBS only after excluding other organic causes for your other symptoms like low weight and much cramps along with a partial villous atrophy, which could occur in celiac disease.

Till then, I would advise you to go for a high roughage diet, and enough liquids, with avoidance of food from outside specially the fast food, and complete NO to consumption of alcohol if you do. I would also advise you for an anti spasmodic along with a proton pump inhibitor drug for a symptomatic relief of the cramps.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Please type your queryre..my 1 month baby is passing out gas nd eating every hrs and still her stomach makes noise nd cry alots she. Don t sleep that much just half a hrs what should I do it s like she have lots of gas","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.This is called evening colic and is quite common in this age group. This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in air too. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief.The two best ways to relieve this distress is -1. Do not put the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2. If still crying - put the baby in prone position and keep patting the back gently so that the baby passes off the flatus and gets relieved.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all.Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time.

Peptic ulcer disease is caused by Helicobacter pylori bacteria and which may be in form of follicular gastritis, nodular gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcer, and adenocarcinoma of stomach. You should consult with internal medicine specialist/ gastroenterologist and should go for thorough check up. You should also go for ultrasound imaging, endoscopy and serum amylase and lipase. You should also go for urea breathe test for H. Pylori. You should also take proton pump inhibitors along with antacids. Eradication of H. pylori is required for complete treatment of peptic ulcer disease. Take care, Dr. Mayank Bhargava"},{"Patient":"HI, I have a 82 days old child.

I will explain you how a viral illness behaves so that you can be more confident.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi, my two 1/2 year old has been bitten 4 times at a day care now. By a little boy who is a little bit younger than her. He has bitten her hard enough to bruise her arm and the bruise stays for up to a week or two a time. She is small for her age. She is a primordial dwarf. The problem is that almost every time she has been bitten, (which has fallen around any where to a few weeks to a month a part) she has gotten sick within a day or two after with cold like or viral infection symptoms. Could a bite that does not break the skin, but leaves a dark bruise cause her to get sick? He has asthma and is on asthma medication. We are concerned because she was bit a few days ago and she is already getting cold symptoms. We did not really think about the fact she had gotten sick every time until some one had pointed it out today. Could his bite do this to her, since he is biting her so hard?","Doctor":"Hi... by what you quote I feel that your kid is going through recurrent viral illnesses, which are very common in search scenarios like kindergarten and play school. Definitely there is no relation between the kid biting her and her illness. Do not worry about it.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, in diagnose we found my son have adenoid he is 4 years old, he use to breath from mouth and snoring while sleeping.

The burning in the stomach has nothing to do with the pills.

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day.

I feel that your baby is having cow's milk protein allergy. Unusually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age.My suggestions for you -1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds.3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4.

When will his system be normal and when should i give him soilds?","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.This is called evening colic and is quite common in this age group. This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in air too. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief.The two best ways to relieve this distress is -1. Do not put the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2. If still crying - put the baby in prone position and keep patting the back gently so that the baby passes off the flatus and gets relieved.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

FNAC or fine needle aspiration cytology is a safe procedure using the smallest possible calibre of needle (24 or 26 G), going into tissue, aspirating whatever comes out, preparing the slide and getting it examined by a pathologist.

We didn t think much of since he is lactose intolerate and assumed he ate something he souldnt have. This morning his tummy was aching again and he ran a temp. of 104. The lowest we have been able to get it down today has been 102; alternating motrin and tylenol . He doesnt usually deal with being sick very well but doesnt seem to be too uncomforable by the tummy ache. Should we wait to see how he does tonight and take him to ped. tomorrow?","Doctor":"Hi ! Abdominal pain in case of children could be very much perplexing. Does your son have a sore throat/ other respiratory tract infection. In such cases, both fever and abdominal pain are likely to occur specially in paediatric patients. When was he dewormed last ? Sometimes worms do persist in the abdomen even though the stool test may be normal. So consider deworming him on consultation with your paediatrician. High fever could be due to any kind of infection. I have already mentioned about RTI. Other infections could be a gastro intestinal infection due to eating something outside which was not hygeinic, and also could be a urinary tract infection which can give rise both to a high fever and abdominal pain. So one should also go for a urine test both routine/microscopic and a culture/sensitivity. Seeing the duration of the fever and tummy aches, one more infection one has to exclude is the enteric fever for which blood tests has to be done on advice of your doctor and accordingly the management also changes. Over and above, you have to take special care on his diet specially with a history of lactose intolerance. In my opinion, you should soon see your paediatrician specially because of the high fever he is having. Hope this helps you. I wish your son an early recovery."},{"Patient":"I am 13 years old and most of my fringe has fallen out but i dont know why. It now looks like i have shaved it but i havnt.

Icy Hot makes several different skin applied products which contain different active ingredients including camphor, menthol, methyl salicylate, and lidocaine.  All of these are temporary pain relievers, and as you stated,  are directed to be used for children ages 12 years and above.  If your 7-year-old child received a single application of any of the above ingredients just once,  please rest assured, it will not harm him in anyway.  The active ingredients are absorbed locally in to the skin, and will not penetrate the chest or affect his lungs in anyway.

It sounds like from your description that your child has contracted a viral illness, likely a mild stomach infection causing the fever and vomiting.  Skin rashes often accompany viral illnesses in children, and can be intensely itchy causing much discomfort.  I recommend giving your child an over-the-counter antihistamine allergy medicine to relieve the itchiness.  For short term effect and help with sleeping, you can give a dose of Benadryl (diphenhydramine).   For a non-sedating prolonged effect during the day, try using Zyrtec (cetirizine).  You can also apply an anti-itch skin remedy such as calamine lotion.  as the viral illness subsides and resolves, the rashes themselves will also feed away and disappear."},{"Patient":"My 3 year old son loves his bottle and that is how he drank his milk until about a week ago when I took it away.

I ve also refused to give him juice until he drinks his milk, but he would choose to go a whole day without drinking. Please help! Kelly","Doctor":"Hello. Bottle weaning milk can often be very challenging with toddlers. Since your child already knows how to use a silly cup, it is simply a matter of no longer giving him any bottles at all. He may go on a \\"milk-strike\\" as you described and that's okay. You can feed him yogurt and cheese as alternate dairy sources.  To get him to drink milk, you can continue to deny him his juice until he has a cup of milk, even if he refuses to drink all day.  No child will ever dehydrate themselves to any point of danger when the drink is available for him.  Thirst is a powerful motivator so stand your ground and he will eventually give in.

Thanks for your query. Your symptoms could be anxiety-related. Anxiety can manifest itself with not only psychological symptoms, but with physical symptoms also. If you are having recurrent such symptoms or having difficulty managing your stress, then I would advise you consult a psychiatrist for a detailed psychological assessment and further treatment. There are effective treatment options - in the form of medication or counselling / psychotherapy which will help you overcome your problems. Regular physical exercise, diet control and adopting a healthy lifestyle are also essential in your situation. Wish you all the best.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better.

There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment.

My granddaughter seems to have a constant cold and I am concerned that it is related to always placing a pacifier that is not as clean as it should be in her mouth.

As your appendix is already removed, this angle can be safely excluded now. With all probabilities, presently you have got infection of your intestines due to eating food from outside. Get your stool tested both routine for ova/cyst and also culture and sensitivity test. In the mean while you should consult your family doctor to start you on some empirical antibiotic for intestinal infections and change if required depending on the culture and sensitivity report. He may also add an antispasmodic and a proton pump inhibitor along with a probiotic for you.On the dietary front you should go for fresh curd, banana and bland diet with plenty of liquids with electrolyte content to keep you properly hydrated. On a long term basis and because of your IBS history, you should avoid eating regularly from outside. So far as practicable, I will advise you to cook you own food at home and eat more of roughage and liquids. I am not aware of your job profile.

I was sick with the flu this past Tuesday vomitting liquid diarrhea until the next day, wednesday. Then, Thurs. And Friday and saturday horrible stomach cramps Especially when I layed down. Tear jerking. I went to the local immediate care. They didn t know why my stomach was cramping. I called my locaL pharmacist she said it is common after flu to have acid in stomach and gassy. I took a pepsid and gas x ..I m much better. I own my own tok an enima because I had not been to bathroom no. Two since wednesday and its now Saturday. But now this morning I noticed on the left lower side of my abdomen near pelvis it s higher than right siz by half inch to an inch it like a roundish knot kinda. It doesn t hurt to touch But it just appeared I can tell a cinch when walking something is wrong. Help, what s wrong with me.","Doctor":"Hi ! Your flu and the diarrhoea with abdominal cramps may or may not be related. In case of children it is more common to have abdominal symptoms with flu, but it is not very common in adults, specially abdominal cramps for so long a duration. The first diagnosis comes to the mind is a food poisoning. Possibly you did not recieve proper complete treatment for it and this led to more severe cramps in your abdomen. You did not mention anything about fever. If it was there, then it goes more in favour of infection in the intestines. There is no harm in taking antacid and antiflatulents, but I am not in favour of your taking enema. After any loose motions, it is but natural that the bowel becomes empty, and it takes time for the bowel to get loaded with fecal matter to get the urge of passing stool again. Also without knowing the exact cause of the cramps in your abdomen which could be any surgical cause like diverticulitis, one should not opt for an anema. It is difficult to tell whether the swelling on the left side of your lower abdomen is due simple inflammation with mass formation or a leaking diverticulitis precipitated by self enema by yourself. In my opinion, you should consult at your earliest a general surgeon, who may advise some routine investigations for you apart from going for an ultrasound / CT scan depending on the initial examination findings. One more possiblilty of the swelling is left sided inguinal hernia but your history does not go much in favour of it. Anyways I think it is time for you to see your general surgeon and seek his advice. Good luck."},{"Patient":"My 15month old baby suddenly developed a nasty cough sunday, and didn t sleep well of this cough. he cried after coughing.

This last time I felt the pain while putting it in, and the pain stayed. I pressed on the area, on the right side of my stomach and that increased the pain. Do you know why it hurts?","Doctor":"Hi Thanks for using Health Care Magic Forum, It's very common for young women to experience discomfort when first using tampons. But don't panic, because it really is possible with just a little practice and patience. First of all, wearing a tampon will not cause pain in the stomach, so the fact that you are having trouble suggests that it's not sitting in the right place. A tampon should always be inserted up, and back towards your spine, as far as possible. You should pull the string, but not the tampon, back down again. If you feel pain or discomfort it's a sign that it's not in all the way up or that's it's tilted and on an angle, which means you might need to try again (pull it down slightly then push it up straight again). The best way to practice is to get some mini tampons and cover them with a bit of Vaseline or lubricant when you don't have a period. Slip them all the way up and get a good feel with your fingers as to the direction your vagina goes. Finally, don't worry about damage — the vagina is a very strong, elastic, muscular tube. If a baby can be born without too much difficulty then inserting tampons a few times, even if crooked, won't do any harm. Just remember to practise common sense hygiene — wash your hands before and after, and once you do get the hang of them, don't leave them in for more than about four hours at a time.

The pain in the right side of lower abdomen could mean many common pathology : 1) With the urinary symptoms, it could be a urinary tract infection or a right ureteric calculi. Go for a routine urine test and an ultrasound KUB to exclude these after getting consulted by your treating physician. However, this could also be due to any recent increase in the water intake as told by you. 2) Next common pathology which comes to mind is a attack of mild sub acute appendicitis. This may be with/without any nausea feeling and initially starting at para umbilical region about which there is no mention. Also appendix can irritate ureter/bladder depending on its position, and give rise to urinary symptoms mentioned by you. One has to give it due importance as leaving a diseased appendix could be hazardous than removing a normal appendix. To exclude this you will have to get clinically examined by a surgeon and also get investigated as advised by him like routine blood tests and may be an ultrasound to exclude other conditions mimicking appendicitis. 3) More common condition is a colitis and for this you can get your stool tested for ova and cyst and get treated accordingly. 4) You have not mentioned to which sex you belong to. In case of females, apart from the causes mentioned above in 1-3, one has to exclude some conditions specific to ladies, like pelvic inflammatory diseases, an unruptured or sealed ectopic pregnancy, etc. 5) To think of some remote possiblilities, some pathological process in upper abdomen can also give rise to pain in the lower abdomen.

My q: 1. what are the odds that she was affected by Kallmann Syndrome ? what is the meaning of size of her head? her front fontanel is still open . thanks","Doctor":"Kallmann syndrome is the most common form of genetically disease, with autosomal recessive, X-linked, and autosomal dominant forms of inheritance. Clinically, it is characterized by its association with anosmia or hyposmia; 85% of the cases are autosomal . The X-linked form (KAL1) is caused by mutations of the KAL1 gene at Xp22.3. This leads to failure of olfactory axons and GnRH-expressing neurons to migrate from their common origin in the olfactory placode to the brain. The KAL gene product anosmin-1, an extracellular 95 kDa matrix glycoprotein, facilitates neuronal growth and migration. The KAL gene is also expressed in various parts of the brain, facial mesenchyme, and mesonephros and metanephros, thus explaining some of the associated findings in patients with Kallmann syndrome, such as synkinesia (mirror movements), hearing loss, midfacial defects, and renal agenesis.Some kindreds contain anosmic individuals with or without hypogonadism; others contain hypogonadal individuals who are anosmic.  Cleft lip and palate, hypotelorism, median facial clefts, sensorineural hearing loss, unilateral renal aplasia, neurologic deficits, and other findings occur in some affected patients. When Kallmann syndrome is caused by terminal or interstitial deletions of the Xp22.3 region, it may be associated with other contiguous gene syndromes, such as steroid sulfatase deficiency, chondrodysplasia punctata, X-linked ichthyosis, or ocular albinism.The autosomal dominant form of Kallmann syndrome (KAL2) occurs in up to 10% of patients, and is caused by a loss of function mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) gene. Cleft lip and palate are associated with KAL2 but not with KAL1. Oligodontia and hearing loss may occur with both KAL1 and KAL2.A variety of other genes, including FGF8, PROK2/PROKR2, NELF, CHD7 (responsible for CHARGE [coloboma of the eye, heart anomaly, choanal atresia, retardation, and genital and ear anomalies] syndrome, which includes hypogonadism in its phenotype), HS6ST1, WDR11, and SEMA3A, are associated with defects in neuronal migration that can result in Kallmann syndrome, but in most patients the affected gene remains undefined"},{"Patient":"Hi, my question is that my baby is 11 mmonths now and is only eating cerelac rice nothing else and milk.. she hates solids i dont how to make her eat solis coz people tell me that cerelac will only increase weight nothin else its not good to feed her cerelac as i feed her twice a day (lunch and dinner ) .pleqse let me know if is this a problem or i should consult a doc for this ..?","Doctor":"hi.. better start with a fruit like banana or apple.. gradually increase the quantity.. e.g .. try to give one spoon of banana daily for 1 week.. 2 week 2 spoon.. by the end of month.. you can give full banana.. same way add another fruit like apple, mango, sapota ect.. don't add two fruits at a time..start giving 6am .. one egg with glass milk8am.. smashed boiled potatoes or carrots10 am banana or apple12 pm.. 1 cup rice with 1/2 cup dal with ghee. add curd.. try to add leafy vegetables daily4pm.. glass of milk with biscuits7pm.. 1 cup rice with veg or non veg curry and curd10pm.. glass of milk.follow this schedule.. you will see better improvement in your kid..gradually decrease to cerelac feeds"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My son is 3 yrs old.

On followup i was advised to go to heigher center for review. I had taken her to KMC Manipal and later to Narayan Hrudayalaya Bangalore. She underwent echo and CT scan and was started on sildenafil(1/6/2008).After returning from Bangalore,she again had respiratory distress and was again ventillated for 3-4 days.Subsequently after becoming stable she was shifted to Frontier Lifeline Hospital CHENNAI,where she underwent echo,fiberoptic bronchoscopy,barium swallow test,angiogram e.t.c. Finally she was operated by a panel of doctors headed by Dr.K.M.CHERIAN,OPERATION PERFORMED:resection of extra pulmonary sequestrated segment of right lung(at the age of 7 months,22/07/2008). Post operation she improved clinically and her weezing epiosed s which use to occure at an interval of every 2-3 months got reduced. Sildenafil was stopped(20/10/2009) after almost 1.5 year of thearpy as it did not show any benefit as desired by doctor s at Frontier Life Line,Chennai.she was advised for followup after 1 year. she was put on homeopathic medicines from NOVEMBER-2009,and is being treated at Father Muller Hospital,Mangalore.since then till now(last one year and 3 months) she has had no problems of weezing or respiratory distress.She has improved clinically more than what we had expected as parents.She is very active,plays well with other kids,& weighs 10.5 kgs.

Some days I have no pain at all and then I will have terrible pain on some others. It just feels like once I get hungry, my stomach goes to super hungry mode as if I haven't eaten all day. When I have these stomach pains, it is difficult to stand or walk around. I will have to just lay down and curl up just to limit the pain and it gets worse at night. Anything wrong? Thank you","Doctor":"Hi ! From the history of yours, it seems that you are having hyper acidity with possible gastric/duodoneal ulceration. The pain in these conditions occur typically in empty stomach, and specially in late nights when the person may get off the bed and is relieved on taking some kind food. Your dietary habits are no known from the history. Anyways, you should avoid chillies and hot fried foood, and go preferably for a bland diet regimen consisting of more vegetables, and liquids. Also take frequent small feeds instead of one large meal so that your stomach does not remain empty at one time. Take plain cold water as an emergency remedy for  the acute pain in the stomach during night or any other time when you may not have any alternate remedy in your possession. Also you can try keeping the head end of your bed elevated a little so that the acid secreted does not get stored in your stomach. You ought to see your family physician now to be examined to exclude any other clinically appreciable pathological process in the abdomen, who may also suggest you for an ultrasound abdomen or refer you to a gastro enterologist for endoscopic evaluation of your GI tract. Other diagnosis which comes immediately into ones mind are liver and hepato billiary diseases like gall stone diseae, or pancreatitis.  For excluding these problems,you have to consult a gastro enterologist. Your have not mentioned anything about your bowel habits. If it is frequent and loose alternating with constipation, you may be suffering from amaebiasis which also gives rise to chronic  hyper acidity and the symptoms you have described. In that case the treatment is simple once you visit your family physician, and are properly diagnosed. Wishing you an early recovery."},{"Patient":"My Boy’s date of birth is 15th January 2011.

The she got fever on Feb 6 and got well on Feb 8 after taking paracetamal and Voren (insert). Then the fever came back in the evening of Feb 9, so we gave her once paracetamal and anti-biotic. However, she started to have running nose on Feb 22 till now, we give her the Zyrtec. From today, she starts to cough, then she takes Prospan. then this evening she got fever (around 38.3), i just insert the paracetamal bullet for her. Could you advise what s wrong with her? what should I do next? I really worry about her. Many thanks! Catherine","Doctor":"HiFever with cough and cold is mostly due to viral upper respiratory tract infection. It takes approximately 1 week time to recover. you will need to give symptomatic treatment in form of paracetamol, and tepid sponging with tap water.Tepid sponging: sponge whole body including tummy and back with tap water.Sponging just before giving paracetamol helps in keeping temperature down for a longer duration.keep him well hydrated.

It was only my aunt who had survived. My father was born (number 12th child in the house). At his birth the midwife advised my grandparents that -the milk of my grandmother might be poisonous for baby and my grandparents sought help from friends to find a mother who can breastfeed their son (my father). a mother from other faith was found and she nursed my father like her own son. My father and grandparents are all gone but during funeral of my sister in January, 2011, my cousin (the eldest son of my late aunt) mentioned this in one of the family gatherings. We all know about this but since it came back down the memory lane, I was wondering to know, what could have been the cause for those deaths? Can mother milk be poisonous? Also, I would now like to visit Pakistan, the ancestral town of my parents/grandparents/greatgrandparents.. to find the family that helped our grandparents. We are Hindus and had to leave Pakistan at the time of partition in 1947, and the lady that breastfed my father was a muslim. Both aspects are important to me now.

It is advised not to be given only in very rare genetic condition called galactosemia ( but in that case any other person's milk will also be harmful) and some  drugs if mother is taking like cancer drugs and others.Yes what you are mentioning is quite bad obstetric history. Reason can be many but not poisonous mother's milk.

No fever , no flu symptoms","Doctor":"Hi ! The first thing I will think with your symptoms and signs mentioned is an attack of appendicitis if there is no history of its removal earlier. For this, you have to consult an surgeon and get clinically examined who may suggest you a few routine investigations along with an ultrasound abdomen. The next possibility is food poisoning. You may get to have loose stools/vomiting if the infection is severe. Next possibility is a pelvic inflammation. For this you have to get yourself examined by your gynaecologist. The ultrasound will rule out if there is any calculi in your urinary tract which may also give rise to such symptoms. A diagnostic laparoscopy is an option if everything else fails to diagnose the problem. Please consult your doctor and get investigated. Good luck."},{"Patient":"Hi I have a 6 month old daughter.

From your history of repeated surgeries you underwent, there are a few possibilities which should be looked into. Without having the details of the investigations you have undergone till now, following is suggested: 1) With the surgeries you have undergone, immediate clinical diagnosis which comes into mind is multiple post operative adhesions of the intestines to the previous scars, due to which the intestines are not able to move smoothly and propel both liquids and solids resulting in sub acute to acute intestinal obstruction. In this case the person gets recurrent pain abdomen with inability to pass stool or flatus. Since you have got the problem since last 2 years, it seems more like a sub acute one than acute. For this you have to consult a general surgeon, who will examine you clinically preferably during an attack , and may advise you for a few investigations, like TLC, DLC, HB%, X- ray abdomen with diapragm in upright position, and an ultrasound. 2) Next, with history of cholecystectomy, one has to consider stones in the CBD, and any pathoogical process  n the pancreas. This will also need some special investigations like ultrasound abdomem, or may be a CTscan of the abdomen if advised by the doctor. Along with this, serum amylase, lipase, and a LFT might also help. 3) Sometimes irregular dietary habits may also be the culprit. Try to take fat free meals at regular intervals, with more of roughages, and liquids and a regular exercise programme depending on your age and body weight. 4) Ifall these investigations are already done, and nothing could be detected till now, then you may have to consult a laparoscopic gasto enterologincal surgeon, who may consider to do a endoscopic examination of your intestinal tract and also a diagnostic laparoscopy of  the abdomen if thought appropriate in your case.

I eat well, but don't get much exercise. Back in November I was shoveling snow from the sidewalk. Later that night I had deep aching pain all over my abdomen. It was constant, but worse when leaning or bending over. Even sitting up straight was tough. In a week I felt better. Two months later after bending over sorting laundry, the pain came back.it started low in the abdomen and moved up around the belly button and a little higher. It lasted a few days and went away. Then a week later after similar movements it came back. This has been the pattern for the last couple months, it is now April. Sometimes the pain is sharp, but mostly aching. I can move into certain positions which alleviates usually. There are no outward bulges, but made appointment with a doctor thinking it could be a hernia. The discomfort moved around a little so I wasn't sure what it could be. The doctor didn't feel anything and said it wasn't a hernia unless it was really small.he told me to go home and do ab crunches to strengthen the muscles. I don't think that's a good idea, so I asked for an ultrasound. He said no, but ordered a CT Scan with oral contrast. I am scheduled for tha later this week. The last few days I have felt very good and almost forget about the discomfort. However, I know it can comeback quickly by just moving the wrong way. I haven't noticed any change in digestive or bowel systems. No nausea or weight loss.

The symptoms you have described shows that the pain and discomfort comes whenever your intra abdominal pressure increases. The possibility of a para esophageal hernia or any other uncompleted internal hernia can not be ruled out. It is very difficult to diagnose these cases from external examination. Sometimes it may give rise to symptoms of Gastro esophageal reflux disease like hyperacidity, dysphagia, etc. These can be diagnosed with the help of X-rays chest/abdomen and a CECT abdomen. An ultrasound may also be done to exclude hepato biliary pathology. Till then, you can start taking some antacid liquids and a proton pump inhibitor for reducing the acid secretion  in the stomach. If the pain is too severe, then one can opt for a anti spasmodic. Hope this information will help you out."},{"Patient":"My son is 5.  He has been complaining he cant pee.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do. Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridges & soups.You can use siloderm ointment for diaper rash.Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time.

Valparine is drug of choice to start with. The treatment goes like 1.If seizures are controlled with current dose it will be continued same till 2 years seizures free period. After that EEG will be repeated and then if everything is normal medicine will be stopped. But keep in mind that though dose remains same in such cases in terms of per kg . As she will grow her weight will increase so dose of drug will increase according to her weight. Many make a mistake to continue same absolute dose and not following with doctor and that may result in breakthrough seizures due to inadequate dose for growing weight. 2. There is no blanket dose to suit everyone. There is starting dose and maximum dose. Between these doctor see what dose suits child. So you will have to keep patience initially for days or month for dose titration even if seizure comes. Keep patience and not immediately change drug and doctor. 3.

As it contains chamomile in it and chamomile is allergic to some infants. they are not able to digest it.Best way of getting rid of the rashes is , stop giving your grandchild gripe water.

Still if you feel like asking anything then please write us back.ThanksDr. Tripat Mehta"},{"Patient":"My 4 month old daughter s stool test report confirms the presence of mucus, 80-100 hpf pus cells, and 25-30 hpf RBCs. Doctor has prescribed a 7 day course of Oflox 100. However, I read on internet that Oflox has been banned in US. Am a little apprehensive about giving the same to my daughter. Also, my daughter is exclusively breastfed, so what might be the reason for repeated infections, since she had this infection 2 months back also. (She was treated with Walamycin then).","Doctor":"Hi, I absolutely understand your concern. As rightly mentioned Ofloxvis not recommended in a 4month old... The reason for again repeated episode is improper medication. Definitely antibiotics is required... For such a heavy load I would recommend an IV antibiotic than an oral one. So kindly go to another doctor in a hospital set up and take their guidance....Tc."},{"Patient":"Hi, it's 3am here and my 14 month old woke up and was hot to the touch. I took her temp and it's (37.7C) 100F. That's ok. But when I finally got her to fall back alseep, she started to jerk in her sleep. About every 10 to 15 seconds her arms and legs would jerk just for a second. It lasted a few minutes and now seems to have stopped. Should I be worried or can I just let her sleep and see how she is in the morning?","Doctor":"Hi, if the temperature is not raising and if the jerks are no more... then you can go morning to get your kid examined....

Not as much itching, but painful for her to sit and is keeping her up at night. Since it had a white head on it,we sterilized a needle and lanced/scraped it and some pus like stuff came out. She had a little bit of short term relief, but by the next evening the area around the bump is red and there is a hardness under the skin and the pain has gotten worse. We ve been giving her Ibuprofen and she continues to use the HCTZ but she is not sleeping and it does not seem to be healing. She is so embarrassed about it. Should we go to doctor/ER?","Doctor":"Hi, I guess there is an abcess... The HCTZ cream will not work. Needs a course of antibiotic. Please consult your doctor for the same.

The hormonal imbalance can cause the spotting . The painful menstruation can be due to passage of clots and may not be related to Duromin. Consult your Gynecologist to see if there is a correlation.You stomach is also bloated and this may be the reason for your cramps, intestines trying to push the gas out. The only another symptom is dry mouth. For bloating you can have the following:5-day course of an antibiotic, metronidazole, activated charcoal and PPI.Avoid foods and beverages which increase your bloating."},{"Patient":"Hi iv resently been experiencing really sore bloating pains in my stomach and have had watery droppings , i have the contraceptive implant rod in but have been told its not always 100% iv had all the symptoms of possably being pregnant exept sore breasts iv done 4 pregnancy tests in the space of 3 months but all have come back negitive please help.","Doctor":"Hi ! From your history of having a contraceptive implant rod in and the four pregnancy tests done in last 3 months coming as negative, with watery droppings, the diagnosis goes more in favour of a pelvic infammatory disease. This will also give rise to abdominal pains and also fever at times of which there no mention. For a confirmation on pregnancy, please go for a serum gonadotropin test, and an ultrasound of abdomen under guidance of your family doctor. However, please get a urine routine and culture sensitivity test to exclude a urinary tract infection. The ultasound abdomen will also exclude any chance of having any other coexisting intra abdominal pathology like gall stones.

You are already giving treatment for constipation for last 4 years with no improvement in his condition.

However there can be a concomitant fungal infection of the skin too. I suggest that you see a pediatrician who can look at the rash and treat it apropriately. In the meanwhile keep the nappy area clean and dry, avoid baby wipes( use water and cotton), pat dry and use nappy rash cream."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, My daughter is one year and 6 months old.A couple of weeks back she was running high fever, we could relate it with the flu as she had it running that time.Our pediatrician advised us for the urine analysis which showed some puss cells (6-8)and later the culture showed the invasion of E-coli bacteria in her bladder and she was on antibiotics.Now, again we did the urine analysis which is showing quite weired results, it shows that the puss cells have increased (8-12).we are waiting for the culture report though..I am quite worried about this little baby.Please advice?","Doctor":"HiUrine report analysis depend on many variants.For young infants ideal method of collection is direct aspiration from bladder or catheterisation. Direct catched sample may get contaminated with organism in perineal area. 2 nd thing is whether the sample was assessed after centrifugation or not. In uncentrifuged sample less than ten pus cells are not significant. sometimes pus cells are increased without urinary tract infection. wait for urine culture , see if it has significant colony count of E coli( keep in mind E. coli are normally present there so their mere presence is not significant but their increased number is important)"},{"Patient":"I have a 9 year old grandchild who suffers from severe mood swings.

Given that the problem is disrupting his daily activities and family life, your grandchild definitely needs medical help. Has your grandson been evaluated for this problem before?.

Fever with rash in 9 months old may be infection. If child is fine between fever with mild red flat rash it may be viral.

I have been having more dull aches on the right side of my abdomen with a pulling sensation along with a hard lump right next to my hipbone (it's not a round lump, it is more like a long lump about 2 inches across).  If I am lying down, I cannot feel the lump.  When I suck my stomach in I can feel it.  It also aches at times.  I am wondering what this could be.  The last time I had the cysts,, I couldn't actually feel them through my skin.  I have a yearly appt. with my obgyn at the end of April.  I am scared of what this could be.","Doctor":"Hi ! You have not mentioned the details of laparotomy, whether the uterus and ovaries were removed or not.  The following could be the reasons: 1) It could be a incisional hernia, or a inguinal hernia not related to the incisiion. An uncomplicated hernia usually gets reduced of its own while lying down, and and can come out again on increased intrabdominal pressure due to any reason. It can be differentiated only on clinical examination of the patient by the treating doctor. 2) If your ovaries were not removed, then your doctor may advise you for a repeat ultrasound/CT scan to know the nature of the swelling. I would suggest you to go to your gynaecologist and get yourself assessed soon. I wish you a early recovery."},{"Patient":"My son is suffering from loose motion for the past 4 days.He is one year old and is breast fed and have solid food also.His stool  is watery and yellow in color.He is having Bifilac sachet.He appears normal sometime,sometimes keeps crying.Should we continue with the medication?","Doctor":"HiMost common cause of loose stool in young children is rotavirus diarrhoea.

Although neck lymph nose enlargement may suggest inflammation or swelling of inner throats structures like tonsils or pharynx due to infection & this may give feeling of something stuck in throats and difficulty in swallowing.

Your stomach suddenly became sour, and tender, hurts when you move or breath in, at the upper central part of the belly. Most probably it is due to the green tea, and rasberry ketones also can cause the pain. Probably you have taken them in empty stomach, or they may show irritation with out any reason also. If you happen to get the gastric pain it could be due to gasritis or ulcer. other causes are pancratitis,  gall bladder pain, hepatitis. Such occasional pains usually subside automatically, if no relief consult a surgeon for diagnosis and treatment. You may have to go for M.R.I.besides other routine tests for confirmation.

It is just a bronchodilator...If the kid is suffering from so much cold then he could be have issues with season change... Nebulisation also we do not give more then three days .

The first I will discuss is the lower abdominal pain . Located in the center of my abdomen, right in the pelvic region, deep, not superficial. It s not even a pain really, more like an uncomfortable pressure. It never ceases, but at times its barely noticeable, and at other times, it s painful, but not sharp pain at all, but dull heavy almost-pain but isn t. Easy to endure, easy to ignore. Coughing and sneezing cause painful pressure. Sex is often painful somewhere deep inside, near my uterus. Almost never get constipation, usually have loose bowels and alot of painful gas... I have regular periods, which are medium / heavy flow with alot of cramping and passing blood clots, sometimes as big as dimes. My cycles have always been regular, except 2 years ago. I was also 140 lbs overweight (topped the scales at 270 lbs. on home scale), I was working and going to school full time. My periods stopped for about 6 months. Later, when I back on a normal schedule, and lost some weight, periods went back to normal. I have since lost 70 lbs. I also believe myself to have a hormone imbalance of some sort, cause I grow facial hair (lip and chin , male pattern hair growth), and quite a lot of body hair as well. I have to shave facial hair daily. I don t know if this info has any relevance here, but I thought I d throw it in anyway... Now for the rectal pain. It comes about once every few months. The only way I can describe it is like this : it s like having a lightning bolt shoved straight up my butt! A bolt of white hot electricity shooting straight through my rectum... It is so painful, so intense, it has literally knocked me of my feet, I was walking and I fell on the floor in pain. It hit me while I was driving once, and I remember lifting my whole behind off the seat and arching my back, and my foot stomped down on the excellerator and I couldn t move my leg to stop. I can usually feel this pain about to happen, it gives a warning, and I have to brace myself before it happens, or else I will fall. It s what I would imagine it feels like to be electricuted. These intense pains last about 10 - 20 seconds, and then they re gone for months, like they never existed, forgotten about until months down the line when hit again.","Doctor":"Hi welcome to Health care magic forum. Thanks for calling H.C.M.Forum. You have got pain in the middle of the lower central area.hurts on sneezing, or coughing, or in sex.  periods are bulky,painfull. You got loose motions some times, and rectal pain. The rectal pain is so sharp like electric shock, and passes to the legs to get fall to the ground. For few months periods stopped, and resumed again. You have also got masculine distribution of hair growth on the chin, etc. I suspect it to be the pelvic inflamatory disease, and can cause all the symptoms. I advise you to consult a gynacologist for diagnosis and treatment.You may need to have M.R.I. besides other routine tests for confirmation. Abnormal hair grouth could be due to increase in maleharmone testosterone in place of oestrogen the female harmone. for this you have to consult an endocrinologist. or you can get rid of by laser treatment.

If it is not related to breathing then try to find out if there is any relation to food or is associated with burning in chest, it may be pain of gastritis or if it increases with any posture or activity to rule out any local muscle or bone pain . she will need evaluation by a pediatrician to know site, local and other system examination to know exact reason. urinary tract infection doesn't lead to chest pain .

Most of the time he prefers to start his kaka on his pants and he goes to toilet. Yesterday I saw that he has very inflamated anus, what would be the cause and solution for this problem. Thanks","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to healthcare magic.Painful defecation and sore anus may be due to following reasonsAnal fissures:Prolonged constipation and straining can cut the anal skin leading to anal fissures which is a very painful condition and can exacerbate the situation by creating fear of defecation and retention which lead to leaking stools and soiled pants.To rule out this condition he needs to be examined by paediatric surgeon.I advise xylocaine gel,sitz baths and stool softener in such situations.   Pinworms:They irritate th sensitive skin moreover itching can also lead to raw skin.Contact of stools with raw skin will hurt alot specially if the stools are hard.Local examination,Stools inspection and stool routine examination  will cofirm the diagnosis.I prescribe zinc oxide cream and Albendazole syrup in such situations.Food allergy:It makes the stool acidic which irritates the skin and similar condition develop as in pinworms only that acidic stools will burn the skin more.Stool test for reducing sugars can confirm the diagnosis.Zinc oxide cream and omitting the alleged food will be my advice in such situation.4th Condition which is very sensitive and grave matter both for you and us(ur treating team) that is sexual abuse must be kept in mind.It can lead to sore/inflamed anus and fear of Defecation.AND you MUST be very vigilant to keep an eye and must INTERVENE if such situation is possible.Hope you find this answer helpful.Good luck!"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here ...is it normal for a six months old baby to have green stool with mucus in the stool? She is drinking soya milk formula. She stool for 6 times in a day, is it normal ? And she is eating solid already.","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.It seems your kid is having viral diarrhoea. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My 7 year old daughter's eyes have begun to move on their own.

His illness started suddenly with a higher fever of 101-102 degrees and also a headache and slight stomach upset.  After day 3, he seems to feel fine and is fever-free during the day, other than the cough, but in the evening he runs a slight fever around 99-100 degrees. We do not have insurance, and my husband was recently laid off. We're trying to determine if this is more than likely just a virus, or a bacterial infection before we decide if he needs to be seen.","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time.

My daughter gets a fever (around 102) for a couple hours one day every couple weeks and then she is fine , but last night and it lasted about eight hours , any ideas what may cause this ? thanks","Doctor":"Hi there, Well, fever is usually a common symptom when there is an infectious process, whether of viral origin, bacterial, among others. But also it is usually accompanied by other symptoms that help to know its origin, for example, chills, cough, rhinorrhea, among others. It is difficult for me to give you a complete answer since I do not know any other symptoms besides the fever and because I am not doing a physical examination.I would like to know more in order to help you clarify your doubts.At the moment if the only symptoms have been fever, my recommendation is that you perform a blood test to determine its etiology in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.I hope i have been helpful, if you have any other doubts,  feel free to ask me, i'll be glad to help you.Dr. Valentina Romero."},{"Patient":"my 6 months old is having watery yellow motions for past 4 days...he does not appear to have stomach pains since he does not cry ...he does not have any fever..he is breast feeding normally too... what can be the reason then for his watery motions","Doctor":"Hello, I have read carefully your concern and i'll try to give you my best to clarify your doubts. Well, newborns and infants fed with breast milk generally have yellowish or greenish stools, and a almost liquid consistency and of an explosive nature. This type of stool is usually performed after each breastfeed and should not be confused with diarrhea, neither for its frequency nor for its consistency, since they are completely normal.This phenomenon is called \\"false diarrhea\\" and differs from true diarrhea in that the child maintains a good appetite and gains weight adequately. It is due to an intestinal reflex called \\"gastrocolic reflex\\" that tends to decrease in intensity as solid foods are incorporated.So it is completely normal for it to make feces of that color and consistency. If your child has any other changes such as fever, increased stool frequency, foul-smelling or bloody stools, or abdominal pain as colics, I recommend that you take your child to the nearest doctor for a thorough physical examination and necessary tests and indicate the appropriate treatment if necessary.I hope I have been helpful to you.

I had to have 8 inches of my colon removed 10 days age.  The surgeon removed the bad section of colon, put it back together and stapled my abdomen back up...the incision appears to be healing well.  The problem is that while my surgery was 10 days ago...I still cannot stand to eat food.  All foods taste horrible to me and sometimes getting a small amount of food and just looking at it makes me a little sick.  Things like bread and such are the worst, it tastes awful when I eat it.

Try to follow them1. Try new foods.2. Make almost every fruit available at home, so that you can try and build his taste.3. Look for more healthy options. Lets say if your child doesn't want to drink milk, then make a rice pudding out of it or make ice cream.4. Add nuts in his diet. If he is not liking to eat it as a nut then crush it with Sugar candy and give him. He will love it5. Choose more alternatives. He is not liking pulses the try sprouts by adding little lemon juice to it.6. You need to know about his likings and dislikings about the foods.  7. If he doesn't want to eat fruit as a whole, then make ice cream out of fruits. Lets say...about mango...crush it ginder add little honey to it and put it in ice cream tray. Let it freeze and give it to your little one.8. Make finger foods for the young one. Call these finger foods playful  such as:apple moons (thinly sliced)avocado boats (a quarter of an avocado)banana wheelsbroccoli trees (steamed broccoli florets)carrot swords (cooked and thinly sliced)cheese building blocksegg canoes (hard- boiled egg wedges)little O’s (o-shaped cereal)ThanksDr. Tripat Mehta"},{"Patient":"My little baby had a floppy laynx when he was a baby, doctors advised me it swasnt bad enough to operate.

You had an operation on bladder, and female problem long ago. Now the incision is very pain full, red and some times it is bleeding. It appears that some thing is coming out through the skin. There is no relation to the surgery done long back, It may be due to the herniation of the underlying structures into the incision, due to weakness of the wall under the sutures. Or it may be due to infection of the structures under the sutures. It may be the reinfection of the previous medical condition.

So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment.

We have been given 3 cycles of cortizone creams, antibiotics and other medications for moisturizing and as I am breastfeeding exclusively have also had it suggested to eliminate all dairy products from my diet.

As you are describing she is taking fruits and solid food, she should have resumed to normal stools. But this is not happening as she is unable to evacuate the whole rectum because of initial pain. The remaining fecal matter get solidified due to absorption of water over next 24 hrs. The cycle goes on. Try applying Vaseline three to four times at anal canal and insert some amount inside the passage. Don't insert your finger.This will lubricate the path and passage of feces will be easier.Ladies finger or okra is a good vegetable, it helps in increasing motility and evacuation of rectum. Once this start the daily passage of stools will be easy.If this does not help please visit your pediatrician for further treatment."},{"Patient":"My 5 yr old child has had fever for about 5 days.

It began occasionally where the pains would present early in the morning around 4 and last for approximately 5-10 minutes. I would have them for a week or so and then they would go away for a few weeks. After several times I went to my doctor and was prescribed nexium. This did not resolve the issue. After a few years of the pains occuring more often I had an ultrasound and my gall bladder was removed. This pains intensified and began to occur much more often. I've been told IBS, and sluggish colon and so on. My concern is that recently...and discovered by an allergist and now an immunologist that my liver enzymes are repeatedly coming back high...could the pain have been from the liver all this time? Also, the pain begins as a hunger pain and rapidly turns into intense pain that begins in the high front area but ends in the back.....so what is happening to the body when it experiences a hunger pain? And the pain only occurs now at 5-6 in the morning and again by 9-10 if I dont eat a breakfast.","Doctor":"Hi welcome to Health care magic forum. Thanks for choosing H.C.M.Forum.

You have used nexium, got gall bladder removed, but pain is increasing and of hunger with more frequency. It also thought as I.B.S.,and increased liver enzymes. At first your pain could be due to reflux of urine into kidney due to retension, and relieved by voiding urine. Liver enzymes increase, hunger type of pains, may be due secondary to gallbladder removal. (seen in some people only.)

Fat delays stomach emptying and can increase the sensation of fullness Stress or anxiety Smoking A gastrointestinal infection, blockage or disease Irritable bowel syndrome, a condition characterized by abdominal pain or cramping and changes in bowel function Conditions such as celiac disease or lactose intolerance in which the intestines aren't able to digest and absorb certain components of food To reduce bloating, it may help to avoid or reduce the amount of gas-producing foods you eat. Many carbohydrates cause gas, and the following items are common culprits: Baked beans Broccoli Brussels sprouts Cabbage Carbonated drinks Cauliflower Chewing gum You can reduce belching if you: Eat and drink slowly. Taking your time can help you swallow less air. Also, avoid drinking through a straw. Avoid carbonated drinks and beer. They release carbon dioxide gas. Skip the gum and hard candy. When you chew gum or suck on hard candy, you swallow more often than normal. Part of what you're swallowing is air. Don't smoke. When you inhale smoke, you also inhale and swallow air. Check your dentures. Poorly fitting dentures can cause you to swallow excess air when you eat and drink. Treat heartburn. For occasional, mild heartburn, over-the-counter antacids or other remedies may be helpful. GERD may require prescription-strength medication or other treatments.

I feel helpless.","Doctor":"hi, thanks for the question. it looks like your child has gastroenteritis. his anus is red due to dermatitis caused by constant wetting and irritation of skin by loose stools. it will come down once loose stools subsides just clean the skin around the anus after your child passes stools and keep it dry. you can also use petrolleum jelly or coconut oil for healing. your child is unlikely to have intestinal worms."},{"Patient":"hi my child is 40 days old. while feeding him and when he crys different sounds is heard as if he is having breathing problem. that sound is not heard when he is playing or sleeping. he sneezs 5 to 6 times per day and suddenly coughs 2 times per day. today some sticky substance came from his nose. whether its common. plz advice.","Doctor":"hi, thanks for your question. from your history it looks your child might be having laryngomalacia, a condition which improves by itself as the child grows. you can give your child calcium syrup."},{"Patient":"hi my baby (1 year) eyes are always filling with water in the eyes , we are doing massage from eye corner to nose regularly as per doctor advice , but this is not at all coming down , but doctor telling they want to do small operation to open that pasage , this is the right or else any other way to avoid this opration","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for your question. your child might be having obstructed nasolacrimal duct. when a child does not respond to massage by 5-6 months it is managed by a small procedure to open up the blocakage."},{"Patient":"I had a bilateral laproscopic inguinal hernia repair about 8 months ago. I'm still feeling an uncomfortable pulling sensation on my left side. It feels a lot like it did before the surgery....I've gone back to the surgeon twice and he seems to think that everything is fine. Any idea about what could be going on? Also it's worse after I exercise","Doctor":"Hi ! Your operation was done 8 months ago for bilateral inguinal hernia. Now you are feeling the same old sensation on the left side only. Have you noticed any type of swelling on your inguinal area just as you had before the surgery. If it so, then it could be a recurrence of the hernia on the left side. But due to improvement in the surgical techniques laparoscopically, this is a remote possibility even though possible. The other possibility is entrapment of nerve or adhesion of the mesh with any other abdominal viscera, or fibrosis at the site of surgery. If there is no swelling, and not any major problem, you can wait for some more time, and see if the problem subsides of its own. Otherwise you will have to get yourself reviewed by the operating surgeon.

As you have had severe bout of pain, and the pain is recurrent, it can not be overlooked as normal. Many times, ultrasound or x-ray may not be able to detect few of the pathology which have not attained detectable size by ultrasound. I would suggest either to go for a repeat CECT scan of your abdomen which is non invasive.

I assume that your baby is more then a week old . Most of the babies have yellow discolouration of skin and sclera during the first few days of life . This is called physiological jaundice and it subsides on it's own without any intervention. This is a normal phenomenon as a result of transition from fetal to extrauterine life. You should be aware when jaundice is a cause of concern: 1. If jaunduce appears on first day of life2. If the level of bilirubin  is more then 12mg/dl. Bilirubin is the substance that causes the yellow coloration of skin . It's  level can be checked with a blood test .3. If the the rise in bilirubin level is more then 5mg/dl/hr. For this your doctor my prescribe repeated test and then plot the levels on a graph to predict the expected rise in bilirubin.4. If 'direct ' bilirubin is more the 2mg/dl or 20% of the total. Bilirubin is of two types physiological jaundice is due to the water insoluble ' indirect' bilirubin so if ' direct  component is high it means it's not physiological and should be a cause for concern. The direct and indirect breakage is given in the blood test. 5. If your baby is otherwise unwell e.g is lethargic, is not feeding well, has fever or difficulty breathing then it's not physiological jaundice because in that case your baby will be otherwise totally ok.You have asked if your baby needs incubator care. Incubators are for premature babies who can not maintain their body temperatures as they have arrived earlier and temperature control mechanisms have not yet been established. The incubator provides specific temperature. Incubators are not used for the treatment of any type of jaundice. Phototherapy is used for that. These are specially lights that convert the indirect water insoluable bilirubin into water soluable forms that can then be excreted out through urine . As i have told high levels of direct bilirubin are a cause of concern and these need treatment with a phototherapy unit . Your doctor may prescribe phototherapy if your child has any of the criteria i have mentioned earlier but incubator care is not needed as your baby is not premature and is at least older then a week. If you have any other questions i will be happy to answer."},{"Patient":"My 10 months child has a skin problem that is before 7 months I saw a round white spot about 3cm by 2 cm, it is not very deep but I am very afraied of it because it is not going yet.

The feeling of being not ok signifies that some infection is still persisting in your wife's body, possibly the lungs. As such the description of your history suggests that the chest infection has not resolved completely. The cause of such a long lasting infection could be a chronic infection like tuberculosis which may also lower the hemoglobin in the blood. Many times tuberculosis is not diagnosed even after all investigations. The abdominal symptoms could also be due the same infection leading a sub acute intestinal obstruction which gets relieved of its own ( extra pulmonary involvement ).

Her scan and bloods were normal and doc has put it down to a viral infection with no further Investigation.she is still in alot of pain and I m not sure what to do Her bowels are working well and she is not due her period What shall I do","Doctor":"Hi thanks for choosing HCM for your medical query. I'm sorry but your question is deficient in a lot of information that would have been very helpful for me to answer. You have not mentioned if this was the first episode of pain or she has past history. You did not mention if she hd any accompanying symptoms like diarrhoea, vomiting, blood in stool or vomitus ,fever, pallor or jaundice. Was her abdomen tender to touch? Has the pain gotten worse or it has subsided in intensity? Is it only present in the upper abdomen or has it shifted to some other area or extended further?You also did not specify which tests and scans were ordered and came out negative. I can infer that the pain was very severe from the fact that she was hospitalised. Upper abdominal pain can be due to a number of causes she might have pancreatitis , cholecystitis or peptic ulcer . Pancreatic enzyme levels , ultrasound scan and H pylori antigen should be performed to rule out these conditions. As you have mentioned she had work up done at a hospital so i assume she was evaluated for these conditions. If all other tests are normal she may have functional abdominal pain. It is common amongst girls between the ages of 5 years to 14 years . It is because of a altered mechanism for pain perception so that the affected individual is more sensitive to pain. No definitive cause for this pain can be found but that does not mean it's not real. It usually presents in anxious children possible environmental triggers are a stressful environment like strict parents or bullying at school. It is usually accompanied by other symptoms like recurrent diarrhoea ,constipation and headaches . The usual sites are around the umbilicus and in the upoer abdomen. If your child has been worked up fully for all serious condition the best course of action is to reassure her . Try to eliminate stress as much as possible, incorporate soluable fibres in her diet . Probiotics are also helpful. Do not limit her activities due to pain and try not to let her miss school. Talk to her techers and explain to them the situation. Do not dismiss her pain as nothing ,acknowledge it's presence but try to make your child see that she has to continue her activities in a normal fashion.

At 3 years of age he had a spell of wheezing when visiting friends who have a dog, and this re-occurred on subsequent visits. From age 4 onwards he began experiencing coughing, sneezing, wheezing, itchy eyes and congestion when going outdoors in spring and late summer. On numerous occasions between 6 and 9 years George had emergency breathing problems when going out in cold weather and especially during exercise. He had a cystic fibrosis sweat test, which came back negative. Wheal-and -flare responses were observed in response to dog dander and pollen. Full blood count: RBC = 4.0 x 1012/l, WBC = 13.0 x 109/l, Hb = 12.9 g/dl. Differential leucocyte count: Neutrophils 60%, Lymphocytes 20%, Eosinophils 1200/microlitre Lymphocyte enumeration: CD3 +ve cells 70%, CD19 +ve cells 15%, CD4 +ve cells 41%, CD8 +ve cells 25%.

Thank you","Doctor":"Hi , thanks for choosing HCM for your medical query. From the information that you have given me it turns out your child is severely allergic to dog dander and pollen. I inferred this from his history where he becomes symptomatic after exposure to these things snd also the fact that he has a high RAST score for them.RAST score is quite a reliable test and we can confidently say these are the things he's allergic to.He also seems to have exercise induced asthama. It's reassuring that other grave diagnoses have been ruled out. The best treatment option is to acoid exposure to dogs and pollen. Other then that you should start montelukast sachet 4mg everyday preferably at night . Montelukast will help stabilize his condition and his bouts of severe allergic reaction will be reduced. You should always keep short acting beta agonists such as salbutamol in the form of inhaler at hand. Your child has had episodes of bronchospasm which can be serious.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment.

I have been having lower left abdominal pain for several months (close to a year) but it got pretty bad a few days ago which prompted me to go to the ER. The pain was severe sharp, gaseous pain before a bowel movement. I have also been experiencing fatigue (on and off) and arm and back pain for several years. In the ER they did CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis, CBC, CMP, LFTs, Lipase level, BHCG and UA. All came back negative, except for a 15 mm fundal calcified fibroid. They discharged me from the ER, but the lower abdominal pain persists and I noticed for two days now I had spotting of fresh blood. I just finished my period last week. I do have history of cervical polyp which was taken out surgically last year. I didn t hear an official result of the biopsy from the hospital, but I guess no news is good news. My OB Gyn however told me it s not cancerous when I asked him. I have been experiencing high level of stress these past two months. Is there any connection to stress? I am very concerned about this. Could it also be IBS or hypothyroidism? I really don t know. Any help would be highly appreciated. Have a wonderful day!","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query. To recapitulate: Lower left abdominal pain for nearly a year - ER -sharp gaseous pain before BM - fatigue -all tests negative except 15 mm fundal calcific fibroid - spotting fresh blood - stress for 2 months - ? IBS / hypothyroidism- With the history you have provided there looks to be a changes in the fibroid that might have caused the pain. Another reason for gaseous pain before bowel movements and stress indicate more towards IBS. I think get treated on the basis of IBS and you will be fine. Get colonoscopy on a safer side to rule out any cancer."},{"Patient":"Hi my name is Chloe and my query is that I have had sex for the first time and now i have a Sharpe pain in lower tummy area and just a little worried on what that might be? also like to add that i have a few vain s on my side of my belly is that normal too i am pretty fair skinned as well is that the case there?? please help me out","Doctor":"Hi Chloe.

As he has been examined by a doctor, that is very nice for him.2. Yes, most of the colds and cough at this age are due to viral infection and they can last from 7 days to 8 weeks (2 months). So I would agree with your doctor.3. As I mentioned, most of the infections are viral and they do not need antibiotics. Antibiotics are required only when bacterial infections are suspected. Bacterial infection is best suspected from type of symptoms and sometimes with help of investigations. It is not correct that a long infection is due to bacteria.4. As your son does not have significant fever, no pus from ears, lungs are clear, no effect on playfulness, I would not think of bacterial infection.5. For such simple cold, I usually suggest my such patients saline drops to be instilled into nose frequently.6. Antihistamines like hydroxyzine may help but not to be given unless suggested by your doctor who examined the child.7.

Please type your query here...My 9 yr old had her ears pierced 4 months ago. She has kept the same starter earrings in the whole time and keeps them clean with the cleaning solution she was given. However she now has a large blood blister behind both ears. We have taken the earrings out and cleaned them again but if we leave the earrings out for too long her holes will close. My daughter really wants to keep her ears pierced. Do you have any suggestions for us? I m I causing more harm by leaving the earrings in her ears?","Doctor":"Thanks for consulting at Healthcare Magic.I am supposing that your daughter's ears are pierced by following all aseptic precautions using sterile equipments by professional.If you notice, pain, redness, puss, swelling, blister suggest possibility of Infection or allergic reaction to metal. For keeping ear pierced hole open,  pick earrings​ made of hypoallergenic materials such as sterling silver or 14- or 18- or 24-karat gold. These types of metals are not likely to cause an allergic reaction. Don't use nickel as it can also cause allergic reaction.Clean the entire area surrounding the piercings (front and back) with alcohol on a cotton swab two to three times a day. You may use antiseptic ointments also. During each of these cleanings, make sure the earring backing is secure and then gently rotate the earrings.If swelling, rednesss etc still persist consult your doctor."},{"Patient":"Have a 3 yr old grandson who hit the top of his head on my lower lip pretty hard yesterday while goofing around.

Nasal congestion can cause headache. Eye congestion can also occur in viral infection. As doctor has examined your grandson after head trauma and found no significant clinical problem then you need worry regarding head trauma.Give paracetamol for fever, decongestants for reliving nasal congestion.If no relief consult ENT specialist for detailed clinical examination of nasopharynx, throat and ear to detect infections of upper respiratory tract and ear."},{"Patient":"My daughter is not in my care at the moment she is one month old I want to supply breast milk for her..

These symptoms may indicate a fiber blockage in your intestines. A ball of the supplement, called a bezoar, may form in stomach and provoke nausea and vomiting. A fiber bezoar is most likely to form if children do not drink enough water when taking fiber supplements. Slow gastric emptying increases the risk of forming a fiber bezoar. Since your son is suffering from these complaints since few months, I would suggest you to consult pediatrician for detailed clinical evaluation."},{"Patient":"i have an internal lump above my belly button about half inch up, started about size of a ping pong ball, now its size of 2 fists and have smaller one starting on right side of belly button , pain started espessially when i was cleaning ,and tearing down boxes...please help, had bad experience with surgeries when i had cancer in my cervix,they couldnt wake me and my upper chamber of heart went out,still on meds,so scared to get surgery,i am on blood thinners since i was 19,55 now,ive had 22 blood clots up till 2008,please help","Doctor":"Hi and welocme to HCM. There are various causes of such lesions, but it sounds to me like this could be hernia, diastasis recti or some subcutaneous benign tumors (lipoma, fibroma, ).

You have got abdominal pain, and cured in a course of time.From your question it appears that you had relief by stopping certain foods. It is understood that if you eat raw foods or semiboiled foods you are getting the pain. It is under stood that you are allergic to raw foods and semiboiled foods due to  some ingridients in it like flavonoids and pegments you are getting the pain. When you stop those foods you are comfertable, if you are particular about taking them, you can try them one by one and continue to take them . With some food you get pain you should stop that food for ever. I hope you got my point.

I am familiar with heart sounds so I can tell its a little different, but I am used to adult heart beats. Thanks","Doctor":"Thanks for consulting at Healthcare Magic.It is normal and physiological. You need not worry. Heart rate increases while breathing in (inspiration) and decreases while breathing out (expiration). This is to compensate for the decreased left ventricular output while breathing in. During inspiration, more blood gets pooled in the lungs so that left ventricle gets less blood to pump out. By increasing the heart rate with a reflex mechanism, body maintains the cardiac output. In contrast, left ventricular output is higher in expiration and heart rate lower."},{"Patient":"my 5 and a half year old daughter urinal test showed all negative and reaction alcalic.

Make sure to prepare formula with dilution exactly as mentioned in the instructions and following all hygienic practices.Anything new must be introduced in a gradual manner along with breast milk.

I am suffering from chronic gastritis, fatty liver & polyp in gall bladder. my age is 62 years","Doctor":"Hi ! From your symptoms, it seems you have got some kind of infective collitis, one of the common ones being amoebic collitis. Go for a routine stool test for ova/cyst. Many times cysts do not show up in the stool, and a course of anti ameobic drug may solve your problem, but only after consulting your family physician. The abdominal pain along with bloating may also be due to amoebic collitis which can also give rise to chronic gastritis. Gall bladder polyp may also be the culprit for this symptom of yours, and in the age group you are in, I would suggest to get yourself to submit yourself for clinical evaluation by a general/laparoscopic surgeon, and consider for removal of your gall bladder for histopathological examination. In the mean time you can go for some prokinetic agent and a proton pump inhibitor for your symptoms. Fatty liver is an incidental finding in many cases on ultrasound. Try to reduce your fat intake, go for more roughage and liquids, and a LFT test along with HbSAg,HCV test if advised by your physician. I hope this helps you out.

If she is gaining weight, playing, passing motion and urine regularly, achieving mile stones normally you shall not worry.This will pass away with time.

They did a first morning calcium and it was right at the number for high. They did a renal u/s and the preliminary results came back normal.

Is this something to be really concerned about or should I just wait and talk to urologist tomorrow? Waiting on blood work up also.","Doctor":"Dear Parent,Your observation that your son has taken in ~1200cc of fluids and only has an urine output of 100cc is concerning. There can be a few possible  causes for this. Your child may be holding back his urge to pee since it's causing him pain or a possible stone may be causing blockage. I suggest that you take your child to the ER immediately without waiting for tomorrow."},{"Patient":"My 6 year old daughter recently had a UTI with blood in the urine, burning when urinating, and needing to urinate frequently. Our doctor prescribed an antibiotic to be taken in one dose only, and the UTI seemed to disappear, only now she seems to need to go more frequently then she used to (sometimes during the night, whereas she never needed to go at night before this). We live in Italy, and the doctor just gave us the antibiotic without any testing. Should I have requested a culture? They are pretty quick here to just give antibiotics as if that is the best (or easiest) cure for everything! Maybe she still has a bit of infection? Or maybe it will take some time for her bladder to return to normal?","Doctor":"Dear Parent,There is a possibility that your daughter's infection has not been adequately treated. Since your daughter's symptoms have worsened, I suggest that you see a pediatrician who can examine her, order appropriate blood work, urine test , imaging and treat your child accordingly."},{"Patient":"My three yr old bleeds every so often when she poops and it hurts her so much. its a fiasco everytime we tell her to go sit and poop she fights us on it.

Could something be seriously wrong?","Doctor":"Dear Parent,Sorry that your child is having trouble passing stools. The fact that you have made modifications in her diet show that you will surely try to maintain the high fibre diet and not give up on it.  Please make sure that you give her lots of water ~1-1.5 liter daily. In the meantime you can talk to your pediatrician about stool softeners which will give the chance for the wounds in her anal area to heal."},{"Patient":"Good morning Sir, I am Sanwar Khan father of 8 yrs old Girl Sazia Begum, My daughter had suffered from jundice , and it is cured after taking medicine from doctor before 20 days.

Commonest one if your child is on a milk only diet. Other serious cause is blocked liver ducts ( however in this condition your child will gave yellow of eyes, skin).

Without a colonoscopy they cant rule it out. Is this possible?","Doctor":"Dear Parent,Your child's long lasting lower abdomen (10 months) pain is a cause of concern. Given a family history of Chrohs disease it is pertinent that Crohn's disease is ruled out in your child. The most definitive test for Crohn's disease is to take a small sample of tissue from his colon( biopsy) during colonoscopy  and study it under a microscope. It is surely possible that your child can have Crohn's disease with  a normal blood work up. I suggest that you consult a gastroenterologist as soon as possible who can help diagnose your child's condition and initiate appropriate treatment."},{"Patient":"My son is 16 months old..since 4 months due to teething he is passing lose motions with severe stomach contractions and has fever till 102 every month..as per the doctor suggestions i gave him econorm and crocin and meftal alternatively during first 2 visits and within 2 days he recovered and last month he had same problem i continued the same and since yesterday he again started motions with temp rising upto 102.

Constipation in such small children is common. It shall better be treated by food not by medicines and definitely not by castor oil. as its a very strong and potent laxative and also habit forming.Start giving her lots of fruits, vegetables, salads and lots of water. This will create bulk in her intestine and water will keep her hydrated, so that water is not absorbed at colon level. Increase her running activity too.Give her a glass of warm water first thing in the morning.

Usually in such cases removal is the option. But his pediatrician is saying at present he is not good for surgery.

In the mean time teach him to gargle with warm saline water three to four times a day. Give him steam/ nebulization three to four times a day.

Now he is in habit of support for passing motions. But he can overcome it.Make certain changes in his diet habits. You have not mentioned if you are a vegetarian or non vegetarian. In any case follow these changes-1. Make him eat lots of salads- tomato, cucumber, radish, carrots, beetroot etc. daily. in every meal besides main staple.2. Two to three fruits daily, at different times, besides meals.3. lots of water.4. If he is not allergic to milk he can take milk too.5. Daily intake of butter milk or curds or yogurts once or twice. Add it to meals. this will help regain intestinal bacterial flora.6. at least one hour of games involving lots of running.7. to start with give laxatives alternate days initially, then keep reducing its frequency get him off it, in two to three weeks.8. Make him drink a big glass of water as soon as he wakes up, then repeat in 15-20 minutes. this will cause gastro colic reflex and feeling for defecation.But take him off any medication for cleansing of bowels ASAP"},{"Patient":"hi i have a baby boy he is 45 days old n i think he has a constipation.and he is only a breastfeeding baby and he poop 4 to5 times a day but last 45 days he has not poop and cry when i used a glycerin suppositories then he poop and then nothing so its normal that baby is now changing or its constipation","Doctor":"Dear parent,your concern is right. A beast fed infant is usually not constipated in initial months. As the time passes, 1-2 months, intestinal motility decreases to a great extent, than it was as new born. Which is normal. That's why milk stays longer in intestine and more time is there for water and nutrients absorption. Milk has very small amounts of solids, so at times it may take 2-5 days to form a sufficient mass to defecate. As long as he is not passing hard motions, you need not worry, he may pass a lots of gases which is due to high protein diet of milk. Apply small amount of Vaseline daily at anal opening so that passage of motion is smooth.You need to take balanced diet, as nutrients are provided through milk."},{"Patient":"I have a 4 year old little girl who has a high fever, chest congestion, bad cough, she was vomiting yesterday, complained of cheek and ear pain, but the pain has gone, has terrible stomach ache, won t eat anything, won t walk anywhere, and she refuses to take anykind of medicine, I ve slipped some grape tylenol into some juice and she drank a little but not enough to be effictive I don t think.

Unexplained bruise is usually sign of clotting disorder but it can occur without obvious reasin.

This organism can be resistant to antibiotics that's why your daughter did not respond to initial course of antibiotics.Surgical removal of infected part and puss along with culture sensitivity will help in determining the antibiotic to which organism is sensitive. Intravenous antibiotics will be required. Investigations like MRI may be required to find out the exact extent of infection.Most children will completely recover from bone infections after proper treatment."},{"Patient":"My grandson started complaining of wasp like stinging pain on his left browbone last night and this morning across to the middle. he has lot problems, takes 90 mg exlax for bowels evey day has allergies and asthma has swallowed meconiun when born almost died, should I be worred about this new pain.

YOu should not ,many women experience this periodicaly and it can be just more intensive menstrual pain. Some disorders which may be considered are endoetriosis and ovarian cysts.

Medication is helping him to get rid of excessive mucus. Which he swallows. This mucus is very sticky. Therefore may cause vomiting, as it cant pass ahead of stomach. If it passes ahead in the intestine it may cause small frequent motion as this sticky substance does not form a solid mass of fecal matter. This will go on for a few days. Be patient.

Kindly go ahead with investigations and required medication.As far as homeopathy is concerned, you may try some one good, but they always say that initially symptoms will flair up, and they do.

The pediatrician thinks the contant mucas is causing ear infections..HELP!!!","Doctor":"Thanks for consulting at Healthcare Magic.Chronic nasal congestion in kids commonly occurs due to infections, allergies, irritants, enlarged adenoids etc. Chronic nasal congestion causes blockage of eustachian tube which causes ear problems.Clear watery nasal discharge, rashes, sneezing may suggest some allergic cause.Sticky, yellowish nasal discharge, post nasal drip, fever may suggest infection (sinusitis).As you have already completed courses of antibiotics, I would suggest you avoid exposure to possible allergens, use nasal decongestants and oral antihistaminics and arrange consultation with ENT specialist. He will do detailed clinical examination of nose, nasopharynx, throat and ear to determine the exact cause."},{"Patient":"My 6 year old daughter was in mid conversation when her eyes welled up with tears and she grabbed the center of her chest.

She gets thirsty at night, keep a bottle of water with her and keep a watch if any other complain she makes. Does she has any other complain with thirst? In such a case she needs an evaluation by a pediatrician at least once.For the chest pain, at times a bolus of air trapped in esophagus or respiratory tract may cause a sharp pain, this is a transient phenomena, may happen with any one.

It burned to pee. I was also congested last week, and a month or so back I had pains on my left side by my rib cage. I am sexually active and I don't know what this could be . Please help !!","Doctor":"Hi there ! The pain in your left side rib cage could be due to respiratory tract infection as described in your history and also due to a possible infection of the pleurae. The burning sensation while passing urine is possibly and rightly due a urinary tract infection, which occurs not infrequently in sexually active females. This could be associated with infection of the pelvic organs giving rise to pain in the back and lower abdomen. The treatment for both needs proper antibiotics. The irregular bleeding could be due to your contraceptive plan B , but a chance miscarriage can not be excluded. Any foreign body in the uterus may give rise to such symptoms. You should go for routine blood and urine tests, along with an ultrasound of the abdomen and an x-ray chest if advised by your physician and only after excluding pregnancy.

Results of BERA performed by an audiologist not only help in identifying the cause of hearing loss but also help in deciding type of hearing aid that might be required.Early identification of the cause of hearing problem along with early treatment (like hearing aid, cochlear implant etc.) has  been  associated  with  improved  speech outcomes in infants.Your child may require hearing aid at least in left ear."},{"Patient":"My son has been having fever for 8 days.

I am just concern about all this pain meds going into his body for so long.","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day.If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all.Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"I am experiencing lower abdominal pressure and this afternoon when i went to urinate there was a thick mucus like reddish-brown discharge . I had my cycle on the 20th of March lasted maybe about three days, I had sex about a little over a week later and now I am experiencing the lower abdominal pressure and the mucus like discharge what could this mean?","Doctor":"Hi! You have not mentioned if you have got fever or not. With fever, it could be a pelvic inflammatory disease in which you may get such discharge with foul smell of which there is no  mention in your history. The second possibility is that you might have got a miscarriage with an undiagnosed pregnancy. You have not mentioned about your age. In relatively older age groups with repeated deliveries, we may expect some kind of prolapse of genital organs in which one may get lower abdominal pressure along with a reddish brown discharge. You should consult your gynaecologist and get yourself examined, who may advise you for an ultrasound abdomen along with a routine urine test, a urine pregnancy test, and a serum HCG.

Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.There is no need to use antibiotics (especially broad spectrum antibiotics like ciprofloxacin and Azithromycin in such an young baby) unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I strongly suggest that you stop the antibiotics.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do. Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridges & soups.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

Many times they do not feel a sense of achievement and growth which makes them apathetic and unmotivated.Many teens would prefer to do nothing but lie about, play video games and rely on their parents for all their needs.

Any baby at this age, if at all there is spontaneous bruising we need to look up if there is a clotting factor defect. But if that is so, he should have been bleeding profusely and for a long time after his regular vaccinations which you have not mentioned.

My daughter made it quite clear that is was much worse than that and that it was interfering with school. She is also extremely fatigued after school and on the weekends.

Possibly you have had a food poisoning which can give rise to cramps in the stomach followed by diarrhoea and vomiting. The sweating and extreme blood rushing in the ears may be due to over stimulation of the autonomic nervous system. Simply taking imodium will not cure your infective pathology in the stomach.

In your child values of both ALP and ALT are within NORMAL range.Right bundle branch block (RBBB) in children has been associated with cardiac surgery, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, congestive heart failure, right ventricular systolic dysfunction, atrial septal defect (ASD), Ebstein anomaly etc. To find out the exact CAUSE of RBBB your doctor has advised Echocardiography.I don't think this problem has anything to do with eating disorder from which your child is suffering.Isolated RBBB is not fatal. It is usually considered benign condition. So you need not worry so much. After Echocadiography your doctor will determine the cause of RBBB and will treat accordingly."},{"Patient":"Hi there.

Old son keeps pooping his pants and hiding his underwear. He shows no remorse whatsoever. We tried positive reinforcement, counseling, miralax, high fiber diet and nothing works. He knows he s doing it so I don t agree with encopresis. I m running out of ideas.","Doctor":"The FIRST step to treating encopresis is to identify the CAUSE behind the condition​.1. Functional constipation (persistent constipation with incomplete defecation without evidence of a structural or biochemical explanation) is one of the main causes of encopresis, accounting for 90% of cases amongst children.2. Psychological factors: Overall 30-50% of children with encopresis have a comorbid emotional or behavioural disorder like separation anxiety, specific phobias, generalized anxiety. Rarely some may have neurological problem causing encopresis.Detailed clinical examination by pediatrian, investigations like X-ray abdomen, barium enema, anorectal manometry etc. may help in diagnosing exact cause of encopresis.Once cause of encopresis is established, NEXT STEP is to proceed towards TREATMENT.In some cases of encopresis, behavioral therapy alone, such as offering rewards or reasoning with the child, usually is not effective. Rather, a combination of medical and behavioral therapy works best.Ask your doctor about medical treatment options like enemas, suppositories, osmotic or stimulant laxatives, establishing bathroom times, age appropriate behavioral therapy, treatment of conditions like stress, anxiety, phobias etc.I hope going by this approach, your child will be diagnosed correctly and will respond to treatment."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

Some pass 4 to 5 times per day others 3 to  4 times per week. If your baby is comfortable, abdomen is soft, feeding normally, no vomitings etc. then these findings are more important than mere frequency of bowel movements. Constipation is passing hard and dry stools causing discomfort in defecation.Constipation in breastfed babies might be due to dehydration or less milk supply. Increase frequency of feeding. Continue exclusive breastfeeding. If no relief consult your doctor and ask for guidance on transition to weaning, laxatives, suppositories etc."},{"Patient":"My 4yr old is throwing up white chunks.

Occasional sharp pain under right rib cage upon inhaling & pain under shoulder blades. Many years ago (30+) I was diagnosed with gall bladder \\"sludge\\", and approx. 15 years ago endoscopic exam revealed a hiatial hernia. I've gone many years without any digestive symptoms and now, all of a sudden, these symptoms have returned. I'm very uncomfortable.","Doctor":"Hi ! From the history of gall bladder disease and a hiatal hernia, it seems probable that your present pain under your right rib cage and right shoulder most likely is due to acute/chronic cholecysititis. The daily abdominal discomfort, including belching and chest pain radiating to the back could be  both due to gall stone cholecystitis, and hiatal hernia. In my opinion you should consult a gastro enterological surgeon, who may advise you for a repeat ultrasound to see the status of the hepato-biliary system, and also may do a repeat endoscopic examination. Possibly you may have to undergo a laparoscopic cholecystectomy first, after which you may become symptom free. If not the hital hernia has also to be dealt with. For immediate purpose, you may also need to be hospitalised for intial conservative management of your problem and getting investigated throughly.

If your child is sleeping  for 8-10 hrs during the day especially at evenings, he will find it difficult to sleep at night. You can regularise your child's sleep time gradually if it is erratic. Avoid giving chocolates, tv, electronic devices an hour prior to sleep time. Maintain a calm environment , tell him a story or read him a book to sooth him.

In 2008 she had a colonoscopy that revealed a small area of inflammation in her lower colon. She had developed an abscess a few months before which was operated on after it turned to a fistula.

The GI specialist said she has Crohn s, the MD who did the colonoscopy said more tests she be run, her ileum wasn t affected and didn t look like Crohn s to him.

With a family history of ovarian and breast cancer, I would advise you to seek the advice of your gynaecologist for getting an ultrasound and CT scan of your abdomen to exclude any ovarian pathology. Simple appendicitis will not likely give rise to such swollen lymph nodes on both sides of groin. Well cystitis and urinary tract infection could be associated , but do not explain the swollen lymph nodes. If need be and advised by your doctor, you can go for a serial CA 125 level test in your blood. I suggest not to delay and seek appropriate second specialist opinion . Wish you an early recovery.

Now your doctors are saying she is suffering from endocarditis. Endocarditis can cause pleural effusion if it involves right side of heart affecting pulmonary valve resulting in pulmonary congestion and effusion. Two critical tests are almost always used together to diagnose endocarditis. One is called blood cultures, and the other is called an echocardiogram.

One of the side effects of Augemtin is antibiotic associated diarrhea.STOP Augmentin.It seems your kid is having viral diarrhoea. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.There is no need to use antibiotics (LIKE AUGMENTIN) unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do. Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridges & soups.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day.

So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

You may be having some kind of viral fever which can give rise to such symptoms. You should initially get your routine blood tests done with special reference to the platelets including a LFT, Blood Urea and Serum creatinine. In some viral fevers, fluid gets accumulated in the body cavities and that gives rise to edema and swelling every where. Your abdominal pain and nausea could be due to serositis in the peritoneum and other intraabdominal organs. The back pain which radiated down to your legs could be also due similar causes in the spinal cord. Also the puffiness of your face and swellings in hands and feet could have a similar etiology. The nasal congestion also points to such viral cause of your problem. Please consult your family physician at your earliest possible.

Give more oral fluids, ORS solution, juices etc. Antibiotics like rifampicin, metronidazole, sulfsalazine etc may cause change in urine colour but these are unlikely to be prescribed by your doctor."},{"Patient":"Hello Dr. I have 4 Months old Female Baby.

Teething stimulates drooling, which may be worse with some babies than others.As the new tooth rises closer to the surface, your baby’s gums may become increasingly sore and painful, leading to fussiness and crying.Other possibility like gum infection, tonsillitis, pharyngitis etc. seems unlikely as your baby is not having fever right now.For further queries regarding this problem or its medications you may consult me at Healthcare Magic under section \\"Ask Expert \\" >>>\\"Ask Pediatrician\\".Dr. Khan Shoeb"},{"Patient":"Hi, My twin baby girls are 1.5 months old (36 weeks PRMI delivery).

Encourage your child to see his strengths as well as weaknesses, use promises and rewards, let him put his demands, let him explain his problems, don't ridicule or ignore him, rather explain him. encourage outdoor play, don't let him see violent cartoons, movies etc.Good discipline includes creating an atmosphere of quiet firmness, clarity while using reasoning.

Medications like paracetamol and decongestants may relieve symptoms.Teething itself does not cause dairrhea but causes few loose stools which are due to excessive salivation reaching gut due to gum tenderness and swelling of teething.

The same thing happened 3 weeks ago and we did blood and urine tests and they were negative on infections. The pediatircian concluded that it must have been a virus because it passed 4 days later with no medication (except for the fever).

Three weeks ago he ate 5 spoons of youghurt for the first time and yesterday I added 3 spoons of boiled milk into his lunch. He loves to eat everything that a 10 month old is supposed to eat, he drinks formula milk and is breastfed. Could it be a reaction to a bit higher level of lactose (since formula contains lactic acids)?","Doctor":"Hi...I went through the history points you have provided -I was expecting that there should have been a history of cow's milk and formula feed (this too contains cow's milk protein) given to the baby. I feel that your baby is having cow's milk protein allergy. Unusually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age.My suggestions for you -1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds.3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4.

It is worth to mention that i had a yeast infection which i treated recently with medicine described by the Gynecologist . the pain only comes when i bent and immediately i stand it disappears. what could be the cause?","Doctor":"Hi welcome to Health care magic forum. Thanks for calling H.C.M. Forum. You had a yeast infection and got treated, Now you are getting pain in the right lower abdomen only when you bend to apply oil to the leg since 3 months. Relieved when you become straight. it appears to be a pain due to stretch, or pressure. It appears to be due to hernia, or stone in the ureter, or may be in the hip joint. I advise you to consult a surgeon for diagnosis and treatment. You may have to take M.R.I. besides other routine tests for confirmation. Wishing for a quick and complete recovery. Best regards."},{"Patient":"my 11 year old daughter keeps getting stomach pain soft stool sometimes greenish or dark brown in color. she has nausea and of and on chest pain. doctor took a stool sample and didnt find anything. but she still has these symptoms what can be causing this?","Doctor":"hi the symptoms that your child have can be due to stomach infection.

Now he s almost 3 yrs old and I ve noticed that one of his testicles is in the sac and the other I can t seem to palpate? Is it possible that it has receded?I have a 7 month old infant who is scheduled to see the pediatric urologist for an undescended testicle and is likely going to have corrective surgery.Will my toddler have to have surgery to correct his also?Or is it likely that they will just see if it drops again on its own?","Doctor":"hi, hydrocele needs surgical treatment.
