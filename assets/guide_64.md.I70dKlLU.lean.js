I know, however, that I am not. As an adult of 24 years old (female) i do not have the energy to walk at a normal pace, to do normal things such as shower without getting worn out, or to be able to simply throw a toy around with my dog for ore than a couple of short distance throws. I have gotten to the point where my husband and I have considered a wheelchair several times in the last year simply so I can get out and do thing. I no longer do my grocery shopping, I cannot work, and some days I cant walk my dog who is chihuahua only requiring a lap around the apartment building. I have had several health incidences throughout my life that seem a little strange when you look at how i am today. At age 4 I was hospitalized with an internal infection which reoccurred without hospitalization around age 7. At age 12 I contracted step throat for the second time and experience swelling of my spleen to the point of having to have blood tests done biweekly for 2 months to ensure I my spleen and liver were okay. At the time I played soccer (4th year) and had to quit the team along with all physical activity for that time period. I have no regained the physical capacity to run long distances without a great deal of abdominal pain. It seems that every time I try to get into a workout routine, intense or simple yoga, I get extremely sick. 8 months ago I was diagnosed with Interstitial Cystitis with glomuals. Since i have regulated my diet I have become increasingly weaker and more fatigued. I have muscle pain in my hips and thighs that causes my legs to want to fold up and pull my knees to my chest. This has been an issue for 8 years. Around the time my legs began to pull towards me I had a sever skin infection throught my body which lasted on and off for about 5 years. at age 22 I had 4 ovarian cysts that were up to 3 centimeters that ruptured within 9 months. Around htat time I became chemically sensitive - unable to take the pain medication they gave me without a feeling of being on narcotics (this was prescription Tylenol) Since then I have developed sensitivities to all sorts of things internally and externally i.e. laundry soaps containing benzene, PEGs, fragrances and or perfumes, air fresheners, gasoline, nicotine, perfume, etc. to the point that I now wear a VOG mask anytime I leave my house, even to walk my dog. I was recently prescribed Prilosec (generic) for my sever and constant nausea and was told to quit smoking marijuana (which I had been using strictly for pain and nausea)which I have done. The Prilosec has helped me eat more regularly, or did the first week, i feel like the effects are starting to wear off the longer I take it. I was told to make sure i drink plenty of water for fear of dehydration being my only problem (i drink 1.5L of water a day minimum) My CBC, thyroid test, THS, and Comprehensive metabolic panel all came back within normal ranges. I was also tested for H Pylori and came back negative. I am at my wits end and would really appreciate any insight. I feel as if i am dying with no good reason.","Doctor":"Hello, Consult a neurologist and get evaluated. You have to get an MRI scan for further assessment.

Also, daily I have numbness and tingling in my arms and my hands while sitting. Sometimes while sitting long periods my bum, crotch and inner thigh s get numb as well. Yesterday my upper arm muscle was twitching while I was at rest and afterwards I could not lift my arm to the side. I could lift my arm in front of me, but not to the side or backwards- There was no pain at this time, I just could not lift my arm... Today the same muscle that was continuously twitching while at rest was not painful yesterday, today it feels as though it is bruised and sore with a burning feeling. I still am unable to lift my arms to the side or backwards. (Cannot put on a bra.) (I sweat a lot every night, for the past 14yrs) I have also have a history of vitamin D deficiency. As well as low vitamin B and potassium. Not sure if this is related to a electrolyte deficiency or if my arm weakness it s something more serious. My current list of medications or Cymbalta 60 mg are modafinil 200 mg Adderall XR 20 mg and bystolic 10 mg.

Current issues: Just finished month long holter monitor- doc said chest pain is being caused by PVCs and to reduce stress. Had an endoscopy on Monday for acute stomach and esophagus pain with swallowing, worse when not eating- still waiting on biopsies to come back to confirm h. pylori infection; dx was chronic gastritis and build up of scar tissue in esophagus (which was dilated).

Generally òver the past 4 years I have been experiencing widespread fasiculations that vary in intensity and seem to correlate with my anxiety level but never really go away. Upon seeing a Dr. about them he did a few strength test and dismissed them as benign. However for the past week and a half I have been having a more localized twitching, in the exact same spot in the paroneal area of the left calf. This twitching is very slight and very persistant. As of now I don t seem to have any weakness however I do have some mild widespread aches as well as the normal widespread twitches. I also have a slightly swollen and tender inner ankle that presented much earlier and may or may not be related. I take vitamins so I m sure its not a defficiency. However an interesting observation is that while my regular fasiculations continue regardless the persistant one in the calf seems often to go away or at least become invisible so to speak when laying down with legs elevated, standing or flexing the muscle or sitting in a cushioned chair. Conversly it seems to be intensified by sitting after walking, any ecercise at all, or sitting on a hard surface. I am dreadfully scared of ALS and obsessively examine the twitch, manipulate it and perform strength tests. None of which alleviates my anxiety.","Doctor":"Hi, Consult a neurologist and get evaluated to rule out neuromuscular causes. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

She has been to a Dr. for a sore hip. she s telling me he said it was a lapal tear. she s not sure. could you tell me anything about this? She has had several injections, she said were cortisone shots. are the shots harmful, or are they using something different?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome,Probably she has labral tear of the hip. The hip labrum is a ring like soft tissue that surrounds the hip socket. It provides stability to the hip joint and lubrication for smooth hip movements. Labral tear of the hip usually presents with clicking sound on hip movements, stiffness and pain.  Corticosteroid injections in the hip joint (e.g. cortisone) are used as a strong anti-inflammatory medications to treat labral tear of the hip. They usually provide long term pain relief by decreasing swelling and helping smooth movements. Frequent corticosteroid injections in the hip joint may damage the joint cartilage.  It is recommended no more than 3 corticosteroid injections in the joint in a year to prevent the cartilage damage. Besides corticosteroid injections other hip joint injections such as platelet-rich plasma injections (PRP) are used provide effective care. Injections nearby tissues of the joint are also used to relieve a pain.You daughter may also benefit from physical therapy. It helps to maximize hip range of motion and stability. In some cases surgery is indicated to treat labral tear of the hip.  I hope the above information will be helpful for you. Please, feel free to ask me if there is anything else you need to know.

Even though you regularly exercise, it is still possible that you may have sustained an injury to the hip joint. It is possible that it may be limited to the muscles surrounding the joint but it would be difficult to know with imaging eg x ray. In addition to assessment by imaging, physical examination would also be important. Rest to avoid aggravating the area, would be helpful as well. Hope I have answered your query.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. After reviewing your health history, I'm of the following opinion: 1. Since there is a history of knee replacement and now facing gait problem thus consult with an Orthopedic surgeon to exclude any hidden pathology of your symptoms like hip osteoarthritis, AVN [avascular necrosis], osteoporosis [check with DEXA which is a means of checking bone mineral density] as they may be the cause of bone loss causing pain and difficulty walking. PS. If everything comes out to be normal you might be advised to go for revision surgical procedure and you may have to take an opinion of a Neurologist since examination of gait [posture of the patient while walking] often gives a clue to a neurological disorder.

Jim Brophy","Doctor":"Hi, Isolated hip pain at your age may be due to stress fracture. it is not picked up on X-ray and Mri of left hip will be needed to confirm diagnosis.

Sometimes I get unexplained stabbing/ burning pains all over my chest. My doctor last suggested fibromyalgia and gave me a medication to try, but it isn t qorking. Can anyone please help me?? :(","Doctor":"Hi, It's a very common phenomenon to have pain in ribs and shoulder blade. This is basically because of the weakness of muscles and the point where it is attached at ribs and other bones, it gets pulled and there is inflammation. So there are two parts of treatment. One is to get relief now. For that you can start with ultrasonic therapy and if no relief then laser therapy. If still no relief then you can get trigger point injections from any pain specialist or orthopaedic surgeon. For long-term relief, you need to build up your muscles. For that start with walking daily and regularly and increase distance gradually till you reach up to 4 km. Then start brisk walking and continue it.

Fact or Fiction: Amoebic dysentery has been eradicated in North America. Amoeba and trophozoites cannot be seen by the naked eye. Amoeba generally float on top of the toilet water, easily visible. Standard O&P lab tests cannot detect amoebas and trophozoites. The infected stool must be submitted to a lab that has the special equipment and appropriately trained personnel in order to detect amoebic dysentery disease. Two or more antibiotics will be necessary to eliminate such parasites; long term if the host has been infected over a long period of time.

The front of the leg has skin and the shin bone quite close together and such swellings become prominent and can be felt quite easily. Bumps which do not cause pain can be due to swellings from the fibrous tissue, or from the bone itself which is usually harmless and can be left alone.

Years ago he took Pletal (cilostazol) for pain/circulation in legs. He stopped when it got better. This week it is back. Can he take the two drugs or is there an interaction. Thanks.","Doctor":"Welcome to HCM community. Before elaborating on your husbnds problem, let me tell you that there are no reported interactions between codiene and Cilostazol. We prescribe Cilostazol in patients with claudiccation. Claudication occurs with narrowing of the arteries of the lower limbs. If the pain is back, it is better to visit your physician who will prescribe Cilostazol along with anti-platelet drugs like aspirin or clopidogrel. Cilostazol helps in improving the symptoms and increases the walking distance. Anti-platelet drugs are given to decrease the risk of stroke and cardiac problems.Exercise is the most crucial part of treatment. Before taking the medication, it is better to start exercising to the point where the pain starts. When he feels that the pain is about to start, he can stop exercising. This will help in the growth of new vessels which supplements the blood supply to the lower limb.If the patient cannot exercise or if the cilostazol does not improve symptoms, then your doctor will offer you re-vascularization procedures. In revascularization, the blood flow through the blocked artery is restored.I would recommend that you schedule an appointment with your GP. She/he will discuss all treatment options with you and make the necessary referrals. Thank you for sharing your story with us.

Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"Hi Looking for some insight on this before I see my doctor. I ve been experiencing a muscle spasm/twitch in my right toe/foot for over two years now. It looks like it s the muscle on the side/bottom (left side of the right foot) and that s possibly making it seem as if my toe is twitching. The odd thing is, I notice it happen more when I m not focussed on it or looking at it. I ll be working on the computer or watching tv and will notice it, but when I look at it and focus on it, it tends to act up less. Almost as if when my mind is focussing on a different task, it will be worse. It also seems to twitch when I extend/stretch the toe out sideways and then rest it again. The muscle will have a spasm and then lessen. Sometimes when I do that, it actual sends a horrible muscle cramp down the side of my foot and it freezes up until it relaxes again, but thats rare. I tend to get anxiety because of it due to me worrying it s something serious. I ve also had somewhat general anxiety for most of my adult life. I understand anxiety can exasperate the symptoms and because of that, I sometimes feel spasms in other places such as my legs. Recently, there has been a spasm just above my elbow on my left arm that has been there for over a week. It started out pretty intense, but has since calmed down, but is still there. I don t seem to have any weakness anywhere. I do get achey muscles from time to time, but that could simply be from biking back and forth to work every day. I try to stay pretty hydrated and I ve been making sure I get proper nutrients, including magnesium. I ve had lower back pain (right in the middle of the lower back just above the buttocks) for most of my life. I remember as a kid, I used to get a crippling, shooting pain that would pretty much cause me to not move (or else it would happen again) until it subsided and then a slight numbness feeling would be there for a few seconds. Maybe that was just a pinched nerve? I will also mentioned, although it could be unrelated, about 6 months ago, my index finger and thumb started to cramp up while typing. The only way I can explain it is that when I go to type, my thumb and index finger want to stick together. Its almost as if my wrist gets tight and cramped. If I mimic the action of typing in the air, it does not do this. Now, I have been using a keyboard and mouse almost daily for over 20 years and I m doubtful I have been moving my wrist properly when using the mouse, so this could be a result of that. Other than that, my right hand seems fine. What scares me the most and is constantly in my mind because of all of this, is that my father has Parkinson s Disease. I am 37 years old and I believe he was diagnosed when he was around 38-40 years old. He did not experience any of these symptoms. I also don t seem to have any other symptoms such as movement issues, gait issues, etc... Any insight on what this could be? What kind of stuff I should have looked at, tests etc... Could it be something related to the muscles in my foot that might require an x-ray or MRI of the foot? Could a pinched nerve cause something like this without any pain? Hopefully I ve provided enough detail to get some insight on what could be causing any of this. Thanks so much!","Doctor":"Hi, Consult a neurologist and get evaluated, detailed work up is required to make a diagnosis. Hope I have answered your query.

Normal duration for fracture to heal in this bone is 4 to 6 weeks. If pain is constant after removal of cast reasons may be; 1. Stiffness of finger joints 2. Delayed healing at the fracture site.

I would also enquire whether he is on any pain-killers for this condition and whether there is any particular aggravating factor for the pain, like deep breathing or coughing.One common cause of right sided lower abdominal pain is acute appendicitis. This is usually accompanied by fever and vomiting. Ingestion of pain killers may mask the intensity of the pain, which may be perceived as a dull, aching pain. Usually appendicitis in its acute stage has a tender right lower abdomen.Irregular bowel movement may lead to abdominal pain and discomfort, which may be vague and difficult to describe.Simple abdominal muscle pull/cramp may lead to muscular pain. I would request you to visit your physician, who can carry out a thorough physical check-up and differentiate a deep pain from a superficial muscle pain. Some investigations like USG abdomen may be required, if the pain doesn't subside.

But after the prescribed month i stopped consuming those tablets. Now I ve started to suffer the same problem. Should i again start taking parkin tablets?","Doctor":"Writers cramp is two types: 1. Simple writers cramp; Simple writer’s cramp is associated with overuse, poor writing posture, or holding the pen or pencil improperly. However, symptoms begin after holding the writing tool for just a few moments, not after hours. 2. Dystonic writers cramp: Dystonic writer’s cramp is less common than simple writer’s cramp and may occur as part of generalized dystonia that affects several parts of the body. In this case, the involuntary movements can occur when you’re doing other non-writing tasks, such as using a knife and fork. Treatment : There’s no simple, one-size-fits-all approach to treating writer’s cramp. And there’s no cure. You may need to try a variety of therapies, and probably will have to combine a couple of them. A typical treatment plan may include: Physical and occupational therapy. Learning how to hold your pen differently, using fatter pens or grips, using special-made splints, and changing your paper or arm position can all help writer’s cramp. Botulinum Neurotoxin injections. Botox injections into selected muscles can help ease writer's cramp, especially when the wrist or fingers move into unusual postures. Oral medications. Anticholinergic drugs, such as Trihexyphenidyl  and Benztropine, help some people. Both pallidotomy and pallidal deep-brain stimulation have been effectively used for generalized dystonia, but surgery isn’t usually necessary for task-specific dystonia like writer’s  or brushing your teeth may also be affected.
