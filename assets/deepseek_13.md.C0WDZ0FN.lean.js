Sorry to hear the demise of your child. Meconium ileus and cystic fibrosis may present in spectrum as they can be severe in some cases and in some cases usually not very severe. But, complications may be many. Cystic fibrosis can lead to formation of viscid mucus plugs which can lead to blockage of the airway leading to hypoxia and death. Usually, blockage of intestine resulting in rupture of intestine or intestinal perforation is not very common in infants. The intestinal obstruction will present as abdominal distension and vomiting commonly. But, in children with cystic fibrosis and meconium ileus, there is chronic electrolyte abnormalities and this may also lead to sudden cardiopulmonary failures leading to death. This is usually the most common cause of deaths in children of cystic fibrosis. It may present as altered mental status and lethargy, abdominal distension and irregular breathing and irregular heart rate and rhythm.

Please avoid extra fatty diet and diet which is rich in protein. Also, don't give bakery items like cakes and breads. Give him lots of water to drink and fruits to eat especially banana.

Cyst in or on the bladder is most probably a ureterocele and may lead to block the passage of urine from the kidneys to the bladder leading to that side renal dysfunction. You can show the problem to a paediatric surgeon for either fetal intervention if possible or intervention just after birth.

The flank pain is mostly dull and only occasionally sharp/ stabbing in nature. I had a low grade fever last night with chills, but it broke during the night and no fever since. I am extremely lethargic as well. I have a history of small kidney stones in the left kidney that I have always been able to pass before. I also have a history of anemia. I have had a change in bowel habits over the last 2 months and have been more prone to diarrhea, but I attributed this to two rounds of antibiotics given since 7/11/12 ( Doxycycline and Cephalexin ). What could be wrong with me?","Doctor":"Hello madam, I have gone through your problem. A past history of small kidney stones on the left side and now having left flank pain radiating to the left pelvis indicates that the small stones have slipped down and traveling through the left ureter and got blocked at some point in their course. Now they might be causing obstruction to the urine flow from kidney to the bladder. This can cause Hydroureteronephrosis. A history of fever in this situation indicates an infection in the obstructed urinary pathway and demands an urgent medical attention. Due to this you may be extremely lethargic. History of anemia may be due to excess loss of blood during menstruation or it may be due to iron deficiency anemia. You need to consult your gynecologist if you have excess bleeding during menstrual periods. If you don't have any issues with your menstruation, then you need to consult your physician and get an peripheral blood smear, iron profile, and serum folic acid and vitamin B12 levels. Change in bowel habits and diarrhea may be because of the antibiotics you have taken. My advice to you is that you need to consult a urologist immediately and get evaluated. You may need hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics. Depending on the size of the stone, the level of obstruction and the severity of obstruction further management differs. Wish you a fast recovery."},{"Patient":"my son just had the same episode for the second time in less then a month...he wakes up and he will be playing and just starts freaking out crying for no reason while this is happening his body go limp he cant stand sit up are anything...his lips and face proceed to go blue and about 2-3 mins he comes out of I and hes fine","Doctor":"Hi....by what you quote I feel that your kid might be having a night terror or nightmares.

If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor I was having pain in upper right abdomen since 4 days. I went for ultra sound and below is the report: Liver is enlarged in size (16.94cm). Outline is normal. There is a diffuse increase in echotexture suggestive of fatty change, grade 1. No focal lesion is seen. Portal vein and hepatic vein are normal. Intrahepatic biliary radicals are not dilated. GB is distended with anechoic lumen. Wall thickness is normal. CBD caliber is normal. Pancreas is normal in size, outline and echotexture. Spleen is normal in size (11.15cm), outline and echotexture. No focal lession is seen. Both kidneys are normal in size (Rt 10.97cm & Lt. 10.99cm), outline & echotexture. Cortico-medullary diffrentiation is maintained. No pelvicalyceal dilatation/calculus seen. No retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy / free fluid is seen. Please correlate clinically.","Doctor":"Hello Mr.Nikhil, I have gone through your ultrasound report. You have mentioned that you are having right upper abdomen pain since 4 days and ultrasound showing enlarged liver with grade 1 fatty changes. well, the liver has a capsule over it. So when the liver enlarges (hepatomegaly) the capsule stretches and this causes pain in the right upper abdomen region. Fatty changes in the liver is seen in many patients like alcoholics and also obese patients. Grade 1 fatty changes is not a big issue. You have not mentioned about any other symptoms you might be having and your personal habits like alcohol intake. If you are having fever, jaundice and right upper abdomen pain, you might be having hepatitis. For that you need to get your liver function tests (LFT). Usually in such cases LFT may show elevated levels of SGPT and SGOT. if your fatty changes are due to alcohol intake, then you need to give up that habit and eventually the fatty changes will revert back to normal. My advice is to consult a physician immediately and get an Liver function test done. Further management depends on your LFT report."},{"Patient":"My 4mo old son has a patch behind his ear that looks like pus and it is constantly moist, even after cleaning it.

Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in children. For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do.For cold you can use Cetrizine at 0.25mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days.For nasal block, plain saline nasal drops will do, every 4-6th hourly to relive nasal congestion.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My 3 year old son has an unexplained knot about the size of a large grape or larger on his forehead.

I feel that your baby is having cow's milk protein allergy. Unusually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds. 3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4. If you feel your feeds alone are inadequate for the baby, then Zerolac is the only option till 6 months age. I request you to keep me posted about the recovery of the baby and follow of the case.Regards – Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"hi doctor, my daughter is 1 1/2 years old, she is having the habit of thumb sucking,i felt due this thumb sucking her front teeth will come out , How i can stop this, she is used to suck while go for sleep, when idle sitting, Is it safe to use femite drops.","Doctor":".Hi...usually kids do this thumb sucking as a relief seeking behavior or self comfort. This is not a major problem and need not be taken into too much account till 6 years of age. Most children can safely suck their thumb – without damaging the alignment of their teeth or jaws – until their permanent teeth begin to appear that is 6 years of age. Suggestions - 1. Try wrapping the whole palm till wrist if she does it - so that she will not be able to suck the thumb. 2. If she just keeps the thumb inside and doesn't suck vigorously - nothing will happen to the teeth alignment - so do not worry.3. Punishing her to get her thumb out of her mouth won't help because she probably doesn't even realize she's doing it. Pressuring her to stop may intensify her desire to do it even more.4. Children usually give up thumb-sucking when they find other ways to calm and comfort themselves.5.  If you can identify the times and places when your preschooler is most likely to suck her thumb – while watching television, for instance – consider distracting her with a substitute activity, such as a rubber ball to squeeze or finger puppets to play with.6. Try to praise the kid if she stops thumb sucking at your behest.Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time.

I m to the point I want to take the anemia regardless what the doctor has said any advise please!!!!!:(","Doctor":"Hello, The stomach pain you had experienced might be an intestinal colic. Colicky pains usually occur on and off, severe in intensity and because of the severe pain you might have felt like throwing up and had sweating. The pain of appendicitis will be continuous and usually associated with vomiting and fever. You had mentioned that your stools are hard and you had bleeding while passing stools. Did you experience any pain at the anal region? If you had experienced any pain at the anal region, it might be due to small fissure. When we are constipated because of the hard stools sometimes small cut can occur what we call as Anal fissure. To get rid of these hard stools, stool softener is not the only treatment. You need to modify your diet. You need to take diet rich in fibre content ( Fruits and Vegetables). Its better to avoid non-vegetarian food for some days.

I am 42 and 170lbs in very good health.","Doctor":"Hello, The abdominal pain which occurs while lying down is usually due to acid reflux. You have not mentioned the site of the pain. Usually this will be in the upper abdomen in the midline region and usually associated with burning sensation in the chest region. In severe cases patients can have cough also due to acid reflux. You have mentioned that you had got all the tests done. You have not mentioned whether gastroscopy was done or not. Because only in gastroscopy we can see the Lax hiatus and hiatus hernia. Sometimes even the gastroscopy might be normal and still you can have pain. This is known as non ulcer dyspepsia. You may also need to get your acid output levels. My advice is to avoid large amounts of food intake at a time. So in a day you can have small amounts of food but many times. Avoid spicy and fat containing foods. Do not lie down immediately after having food. The head end of the bed needs to be mildly elevated. And also consult a gastroenterologist so that he can prescribe some medication."},{"Patient":"7 year old girl complained of tired legs, headache dizziness last night at 5pm.

Two things can be the cause of this problem. 1. Urinary tract infection 2. Pelvic inflammatory disease In females the urethra is 4 cms in length compared to 17 cms in males. Due this short length the bacteria which is usually present in the genital region can easily migrate up to the urinary bladder and can cause urinary tract infection which is called as Cystitis. Urinary tract infection is common in females when compared to males. In the second case, you have an Intra uterine device (IUD) placed one year back. Since one year you had no complaint like this. But now you may be having Pelvic inflammatory Disease (PID) which can be due to this IUD. My advice is to consult your gynecologist immediately and get a check up done. Simultaneously she can get an urinalysis along with urine culture and sensitivity done for you. If your problem is due to IUD, then you need to take antibiotic course and need to get rid of IUD and choose other alternative method.

Depending upon the type of rashes (what you have mentioned as pimples), and the cause could be anything like chicken pox, mumps, measles, hand foot and mouth disease or several other viral infections.

Alert in self and no concerns re urine output.","Doctor":"This seems to be a case of lactose intolerance. Lactose is the carbohydrate portion of milk. When the child is unable to digest it, the undigested remains are degraded by intestinal bacteria to produce foul smelling gases while some amount may pass unaltered as cheesy lumps in stool.

In case of presence of reducing substances, I would suggest changing the formula to a soy based formula and see if there is a difference."},{"Patient":"my baby is 6 months old he has common cold since aweek and his doctor advised carbocisteine for the mucus i already gave him for three days then i read that carbocisteine isnot recommended for infants younger than 2 years what should i give him as he suffers from very bad cough with mucus? thanks alot","Doctor":"Most often cough and cough in children is caused due to certain viral infections. Althought the safety of carbocyteine in children above 2 years has been demonstrated, it is unlikely to cause any problem in a child of lower age. You may give it without worrying. Steam inhalation is helpful in diluting the cough/mucus and can be given. Just sit with the child in your lap and place the source of steam before you. Water in the form of vapor fills the air that the child breathes in and reaches deep into the lungs and helps in diluting the cough and provides relief. Most often such infections are associated with allergic reactions. Giving some antiallergic like cetirizine syrup for a few days should help in relieving the problem."},{"Patient":"My mother says she is not depressed but her doctor is giving her Paroxetine .

So here I am writing to you. Please suggestions!","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query. SSRI anti-depressants, like Paroxetine, are sometimes given to treat somatoform pain disorders (these are pain syndromes, where there is no medical cause detected for the pain and the cause is believed to be psychological). However, even in such cases, it is important that the patient should be psychoeducated and be made aware of the reason for starting the anti-depressant and also be actively involved in therapy. Merely giving out medication without involving the patient in therapy is not likely to help much in such kind of disorders. Besides medication, she should be also be thought other psychological techniques and strategies to deal with the pain. I would advise you take her to a psychiatrist for a detailed evaluation and a more wholistic approach to the management of her pain.

He would not eat and went straight to bed. During the night he continued to vomit & gag whatever he had in his stomach. Water, meds. I gat him a suppository which did bring him comfort. The next morning.. He was better & by evening he seemed fine. Could it be food poisoning, flu or food allergy?","Doctor":"Most likely your son is suffering from food poisoning or acute gastroenteritis. Unless associated with bloody stools, the condition is self limiting. It is unlikely to be flu or food allergy. Give ORS (Oral Rehydration Solution) and plenty of other fluids. It comes in ready made form or may be prepared by mixing a full sachet in the designated amount of water. Replenishment of the lost water and salts is the mainstay of treatment. Unless that is done properly, the dehydration can make the child feel tired. Treatment is not supposed to bring down the frequency of passage of loose stools. The adequacy of the hydration would be evident from the frequency of passage of urine. If that seems to be fine, you need not worry. But if the child grows lethargic, I would get concerned and would suggest taking the child to a hospital without delay. It may still take 3-7 days (from the onset) to stop. You may give zinc supplementation with Zinconia Syr 5 ml twice daily for 5 days. It will help in the intestinal healing as the diarrhoea causes some damage to the inner wall of the intestines. It is preferrable to avoid milk and wheat based items for a week or so. But you may also give plenty of curd or yogurt.

What happend? is there a ways to fix it without going to the doctor?","Doctor":"In the blood vessels, the blood does not clot. But when it extravasates and gets collected somewhere as in this blister, it gets gradually degraded. Depending on the stage, the colour varies between blackish, brownish, purplish, bluish, greenish, yellowish and gone. Yellow is the colour of bilirubin, a degradation product of haemoglobin, the red pigment that colours our blood. It is normal and in 5-10 days it should be completely gone without any need to go to a doctor for this."},{"Patient":"myone year old boy baby had UTI last month.he was on IV antibiotics later within a week had fever and started with oral antibiotics for  week.and this week we have done urine culture and routine shows no pus cells but heavy growth of E.coli..what are the possible cause?","Doctor":"Let me ascertain that E.coli is a normal inhabitant of our body. It is present in the intestines and even urinary tract of ALL of us. So I would not really be surprised if E.coli is detected. It is only when their count crosses 10^5 or 10,00,000 per ml of urine, that we call it urinary tract infection or UTI. If the count is actually lesser and if there is no pus cells, it does not denote an infection. Presence of pus cells indicates that the body is fighting them. Absence would indicate that the body is fine with the presence of the E.coli.In case of colony count greater than 10^5, treatment with antibiotics like ofloxacin for 7-14 days is needed."},{"Patient":"My 3 year old had a cold for a few days then started getting blood in her urine, they cultured it and found no bacteria just blood.

Routine microscopy should give some clues to what it is about. The mere details that you have mentioned, is not enough to make it out. The antibiotics need to be given for 5-7 days at least.Her ear hurting could be due to an independent episode of cough and cold due .

The inner lining of the brain is very fragile and bleeding from there is not uncommon. Usually the blood gradually gets absorbed but remnant debris may cause blockage of drainage of the cerebrospinal fluid that provides nutrition to the brain. In such a case a shunt might need to be placed as in case of your child. But there are possiblities of the shunt getting blocked and the shunt might need to be replaced from time to time.Human brain has high level of plasticity and reallocation of the brain functions occurs eventually, especially over the first 5 years of life. Developmental interventions are greatly beneficial in this regard and may lead to significant regain of function and many of such children can lead a life free of disabilities. But early intervention is the key which you should promptly seek."},{"Patient":"hi..my baby is one month old..he is suffering from severe constipation. I am breastfeeding him now.

Its very painful for me seeing him crying a lot.","Doctor":"Let me assure you that in case of a baby of this age, green stools are absolutely normal and not a cause to worry about. You need not worry if the child passes stool 10 times a day or once in 10 days as both of these are normal for a child of this age and does not signify constipation or diarrhoea. All that needs to be done is to continue breast feeding exclusively. It is only if the stool is hard and pellet like, that an enema should be given to enable the child in passing stool. I would not suggest any medication.Occasionally the child ingests air along with feed. This air can distend the stomach giving rise to discomfort and the child be crying due to this cause. Proper burping and giving Colimex drops can provide relief."},{"Patient":"hi, my daughter who s 15 months old is have lot of phlegm in her chest and keeps coughing.

They thought it was vision or migraines??","Doctor":"Yellow blood stained snot is not unusual in case of a respiratory tract infection and not a cause for concern. But it could be related to sinusitis which in turn could be the cause of the headache that she is suffering. Sinusitis is often hard to treat as they have poor blood supply and hence the medicines cannot properly reach there. Taking steam inhalation should provide relief. Water in form of vapour can reach deep into the sinuses and help in diluting the cough.There is indeed a possibility that the headache is due to migraine or visual problems. These would not be evident on tests like MRI. Clinical correlation and vision testing is needed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My son is 7 months old.

Can you please give the reason for this. I am very much worried.","Doctor":"Let me assure you that in case of a baby of this age you need not worry if the child passes stool 5-7 times a day and it is absolutely normal. Most formula milks are cow milk based and hence difficult to digest. Do not give the formula that the child cannot tolerate. Undigested food material in the intestines can be degraded by intestinal bacteria which might lead to loose stools. Another cause of loose stool in children can be rotaviral diarrhoea.In such cases it is best to avoid giving formula milk or cow milk for a week or so. Soy based milk like Isomil or Zerolac may be given however.

She s on medication but don t know if this is the reason. I tried to brush it off with her toothbrush but it didn t go away. She s been sick since Saturday.","Doctor":"The black spot could have been present from birth. In that case it would not probably be a cause to worry about. Observe if it is constantly there. It is likely to be unrelated to the cough and flu. Most often such symptoms are due to respiratory tract infections and are caused due to certain viruses. Irrespective of use of medications, such episodes take 5-7 days to recover. If the child is otherwise playful and active, you need not worry. But if the child grows lethargic you will have to take the child to a doctor without delay."},{"Patient":"HiMy 5 months baby boy is on formula milke i have started rice cereal in his bottle but less quantity like one spoon in 150 mil with 5 spoons of formula milk. from 3 days he has loose motion, and he is looking week. what should i do.Thanks in advace for your reply soon.Afsheen Kashif (Italy)","Doctor":"It is not unusual for children to get adjusted to new food items. There is probably undigested portion left and the bacterial action on the same can lead to passage of loose stools. However, the loss of salts and water needs replenishment and unless that is done properly, the child will grow dehydrated and this would reveal with weakness or lethargy. In such a case you should rush the child to a hospital and get him evaluated without delay. Meanwhile give him ORS (oral rehydration solution). It comes in ready made form or may be prepared by mixing a full sachet in the designated amount of water."},{"Patient":"my22month old baby son has suffering from nasal allery .i am giving him otrinoz spray twice a .day and relent syrup 2.5ml twice a day.   is it oky or not? .he already completed the course of montairhis weight is 11.1kg and hight is 84cm..is his development is oky?.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Relent contains an antiallergic and Otrinoz is a nasal decongestant. These are safe and frequently used medicines and widely tolerated. The only major demerit of relent is that it may make your child sleep more. But usually it is not a cause for concern.

She is normal in the day but by evening 5 she gets very cranky and keeps on crying for 2 hrs and sometimes even 5 hrs. At times she even refuses to feed while crying. Should colimex be given to such a small baby ??","Doctor":"Occasionally the child ingests air along with feed. This air can distend the stomach giving rise to discomfort and the child may cry or become cranky. Proper burping and giving Colimex drops can provide relief. Colimex helps in expelling the excess gas and is safe to be given to a baby of this age and you need not worry about it.If the child is active and fine, you need not worry but if the child grows lethargic, you would have to seek medical assistance without delay."},{"Patient":"A friend of mine has had severe pain just under the sternum, vomiting (including yellow bile ), diarrhea . He experienced just symptoms about a year ago, but it s back and worse. Doctors have taken Ultrasounds, CT Scans, but seem to have ruled out Gall Bladder problems. He s feeling pretty desparate right now, and has had several appointments with doctors, but no answer yet. He has an appointment with a kidney doctor and an internist. HELP!!","Doctor":"Hi Thanks for your query As gall bladder issues are excluded as per your version then its most important now to exclude now gastric pathologies. Two important entities are consistent with symptomatology. One is gastric or dudenal ulcer and another is gatro-esophageal reflux disorder (GERD). To exclude gastric or dudenional ulcer the investigation of choice is upper G I endoscopy with rapid urease test to exclude H. pylori infection. To diagnose GERD its important to measure 24 hr ph monitoring at the lower end of esophagus. To start with pantoprazole tablet 40 mg twice daily before food and modify your treatment after availability of the test results. Another important entity is pancreatitis which should have been detected in USG or CT abdomen, though it will be better to go for serum amylase and lipase assay. Heart diseases should also have to be excluded. Therefore an ECG should be done atleast to exclude them. I think by all thses you will get the answer. Thank you."},{"Patient":"My son is 1.5 years old, he often sufferes symptoms of allergy & asthema.

It is a mast cell stabilizer and prevent the allergy and asthma from developing. It can be taken safely for 2 months or beyond. If the child remains fine, you can stop it and reinitiate it later if the symptoms return.

He prescribed him 3 days of antibiotics, 4 Zofran tablets, and a weeks worth of Bentyl. Said he could go back to school Wednesday (today) but my son complained he was still sick (though he hadn t vomited in about 18 hours) and very tired (though he had slept 12). I took him back to the doctor after letting him keep sleeping for another 5 hours, he said he was still tired and felt sick, the doctor gave him an antibiotic shot and sent us on our way. He fell asleep about 6 hours later, still exhausted, stomach still hurting but he seemed much better. After a 2 hour nap, he woke up and began vomiting again (after well over 24 hours from the last time he vomited), it started clear as he refuses to eat but after the 4th vomit it began to turn from clear liquid to light grey, then darker grey with grey chunks in it (looking similar to a wet wad of toilet paper) and then it began to turn an almost reddish brown color.

It is produced in response to the baby's demands.  Most formula milks are cow milk based and hence difficult to digest. Do not give the formula that the child cannot tolerate. 60 ml is unlikely to be adequate for a child of this age. You may also try increasing the amount of feeds and see if that satisfies the child. It is best to give the child feeding on demand and as much as the child demands. Often the child ingests air along with feed.

It does not need to be treated. It occurs due to rapid transit of the fecal matter through the large intestines where the bile pigments do not get adequate time to get converted to the yellow colour of stool. It is not due to some specific milk. Most formula milks are cow milk based and hence difficult to digest. Do not give the formula that the child cannot tolerate. I do not think that there would be any problems if soy based formula is given long term. Mother's milk is the best possible feed for a baby and there can be no alternatives for the same. It is produced in response to the baby's demands. If external feeds are given, the child would no longer be hungry and hence the breast milk production would fall. So, unless you swithch back to breast milk, its production would never be adequate.Occasionally the child ingests air along with feed. This air can distend the stomach giving rise to discomfort and the child may cry. Proper burping and giving Colimex drops can provide relief."},{"Patient":"hi doctor... my child is suffering with abdominal pain and vomiting..he had outside food yesterday . i took him to a pediatrician today morning. he has prescribed syp.indowell,syp,cyclopam,and syp.taxim. i have given the doses as prescribed. but he has vomitting and abdominal pain still. what to do?","Doctor":"It seems that your child is suffering from acute gastroenteritis.

After two days again started with high fever n grinding teeth during night n crying sometines telling no reasons. Please suggest me what can be done. I give ventoline and doliprane regularly.","Doctor":"Most often respiratory tract infections in children is caused due to certain viruses. Antibiotics are ineffective in such a situation. Some antiallergic generally provides relief. Steam inhalation is helpful. In case if childhood asthma or wheezing is associated, inhalation of some bronchodialator like Ventorlin or Salbutamol might be required. It is best given using a spacer device. Doliprane (acetaminophen) will help in bringing down the temperature and should be given on when fever is present.Grinding of teeth in children, also called bruxism, often occurs due to no definite cause and does not need to be treated. But in such a case, grinding of teeth could be due to febrile convulsion and hence the child needs to be monitored carefully and taken to a hospital if the grinding of teeth seems to be associated with altered consciousness or stiffening of limbs."},{"Patient":"I have a 9 month old granddaughter who is just starting to sit up but only for a few seconds.

She has no control over them. She can t seem to hold her head straight, it leans to the right. What could this be? Her mother may have taken the morning after pill but the baby is here. What could this cause?","Doctor":"There are many reasons of developmental delay. Preterm bith could be an important cause. Other causes could include lack of oxygen during or soon after birth or could be due to certain genetic syndromes. The taking of morning-after pill is not likely to be associated. The cause needs to be evaluated and irrespective of the cause, early detection and early intervention of developmental delay improves the outcome grossly. I would suggest that you visit a centre for child development without delay and get the child evaluated. Treatment will consist of appropriate developemental support to stimulate the developmental milestones one after the other. Cognitive support might also be required."},{"Patient":"my son is now 6 year... he had fever on 15th jan 2014 with losts of pain in legs specially in mucles, left thigh. then doctor asked to give combiflame for 2 days.

When digital show 99 F the mercury show 98.5. Plz advice","Doctor":"Your child had been suffering from pneumonia which probably had a bacterial origin. CRP is an indicator of infection or inflammation and its steady down trend indicates that the infection is gradually coming in control. The fever may come for another week till the CRP returns within normal limits.ESR is a more generalized indicator that something is not right within the body. It too has been on steady downtrend. In such a situation, ESR can remain high.Such minor differences in the readings would always be there irrespective of the type of thermometer you use. Such a difference can be there even if you use use the same thermometer and measure at the interval of a few minutes.

Recently had it treated with Bactrim but it didn t work, so cipro did the job, now on second course. I have been having dull lower back pain for a few days in my first course then it went away after two days. Now on the second course to totally clear it, I m experiencing some lower abdominal discomfort. It s like something is pulling me on the inside. Feels more like cramps maybe but I really don t know what cramps feels like on the abdomen cos I don t usually have menstrual cramps if thats the closest I can associate cramps to. It s not pain, cos it s bearable and it s a very dull type of pain not sharp pain. Then the cramp proceeded to my lower left side. And that is some occasional sharp like pain. I m experiencing this only today. Im wondering if this could be affected by my UTI? or the antibiotics? But in the course of eating it I haven t experience much of any other kinds of symptoms as this, so Im puzzled by why I m experiencing this only when the UTI is almost cleared and in my final course of antibiotics. If it s not then what could it be? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM You have had two episodes of UTI as you have mentioned. And now the UTI has cleared with antibiotic treatment. But you are still having pain in lower abdomen which is dull aching sometimes sharp. These symptoms indicate that you may have an urinary tract stone which couses down from the kidney to the bladder via ureter. Association of stone with UTI occurs quite often. The movement through the ureter is causing the sharp pain. First thing to do is to get an X-ray of the KUB (Kidney-ureter-bladder) region. The subsequent investigations will be guided by the X-ray report. Majority of stones show up in the X-ray of KUB region. The treatment modality will depend on the site or the stone and the size of the stone.

He is 8 and usually better at explaining pain.","Doctor":"Respiratory tract infections are often associated with chest pain (which is not necessarily due to heart cause). The lungs have an outer covering called pleura that separates it from the chest wall. As the lung expands and contracts during respiration, the layer of pleura that covers the lung (mobile) rubs against the outer layer of pleura adherent to the chest wall (fixed). In case of a respiratory tract infection, the pleura may get inflamed (a condition called pleurisy) and the friction between the two layers of pleura may give rise to the chest pain that the child mentions.I do not think that it is the heart hurting."},{"Patient":"Hi, My daughter is 3 y/o and is generally in good health.

Treatment with antibiotics does not help and irrespective of the treatment, it takes 5-7 days to recover. i would not get concerned if the child is active and fine but if the child grows lethargic or drowsy it could indicate a serious bacterial infection and the child should be rushed to a hospital without delay. If the fever lasts more than 7 days, other causes like typhoid might need to be considered. On the other hand, if the fever is associated with chills and rigors, it could be due to malaria or an urinary tract infection and tests to detect these conditions might be needed without delay. Headache or body ache are might not be specific for any cause and should get relieved with paracetamol. But if severe, medical advice should be sought.

Thank you for the query. Your symptoms are very characteristic for endometriosis. This condition is caused by appearance uterus cells (so called endometrium) outside the uterus, in your case in abdominal cavity. Such disease can be caused by C-section during which cells from inside the uterus are taken to the abdominal cavity. It gives pelvic pain, pain during intercourse, irregular bleedings and many others. This symptoms very often are getting worse during bleeding time. Endometriosis can also cause adhesions in abdominal cavity what leads to bloats, constipations and many others symptoms of partial intestines obstruction. Diagnostics of endometriosis is quite hard as ultrasound and CT scans can show nothing. The only method that usually visualizes this condition is laparoscopy - some kind of minimal invasive surgery during which the camera is put inside the abdominal cavity. So if you have abdominal ultrasound and abdominal CT performed, the time has come for laparoscopy. Hope this will help.

I was expecting that there should have been a history of cow's milk and formula feed (this too contains cow's milk protein) given to the baby. I feel that your baby is having cow's milk protein allergy. Unusually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds.  3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4.

You can use Hydroxyzine at 1-2mg/kg/dose every 6th to 8th hourly for 7-10 days. Most important thing to be remembered is that it has a propensity to recur (called as second crop) within 10-14 days.

His pediatrician has ordered a wrist Xray to determine where he is on the growth curve, i.e. What various differential diagnoses should be considered and should any other tests be done? We do not know his biological father or his height but the biological mother was normal for a Guatemalan female. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read through your question.The x ray is the standard first step in this evaluation. The result will determine if this is one of three conditions.1. Constitutional growth delay: his growth spurt begins a little later than other kids his age but it will happen without intervention.2. Familial short stature: his biological family is short and so he will be short.3. Growth hormone deficiency: growth hormone treatment will be required. This is typically managed by an endocrinologist.

For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.For cold you can use Cetrizine at 0.25mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days.For nasal block, plain saline nasal drops will do, every 4-6th hourly to relive nasal congestion.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in air too. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if she is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief.The two best ways to relieve this distress is - 1. Do not put him in lying position after feeding till he burps out the swallowed air.2. If he is still crying - put her in prone position and keep patting his back gently so that he passes off the flatus and gets relieved.Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

It is very common that couple of days after trauma the pain is getting worst. It is caused by repairing processes of soft tissues due to nerves irritations by cells degradation products. So you probably are suffering because of soft  tissues (muscles, tendons) contusion. Such pain can last for about a week or two. But such pain can be also caused by some fractures as well.

Unless associated with bloody stools, the condition is self limiting. Give Pedialyte or ORS (Oral Rehydration Solution) and plenty of other fluids. Replenishment of the lost water and salts as the mainstay of treatment. Treatment is not supposed to bring down the frequency of passage of loose stools. The adequacy of the hydration would be evident from the frequency of passage of urine. If that seems to be fine, you need not worry. But unless the child grows lethargic, I would not get concerned. It may still take 3-7 days (from the onset) to stop. The excess moisture in the diapers has caused perianal erosions which are painful and hence the child screams while the diapers are being changed. Try to keep it open to air and apply Siloderm Mixi ointment. It should provide relief.You may give zinc supplementation with Zinconia Syr 5 ml twice daily for 5 days. It will help in the intestinal healing as the diarrhoea causes some damage to the inner wall of the intestines. It is preferrable to avoid milk and wheat based items for a week or so.

You need not worry if the child passes stool 10 times a day or once in 10 days as both of these are normal for a child of this age. Moreover, the whitish things might be curdled milk or other undigested food ingredients along with mucus. It is not a cause for concern. If you are apprehensive, you can get a routine stool microscopy to be sure.

She get recovery from that time, and now it comes again after 2 days diarrhea. We did the Rotavirus test, it shows negative. She looks fine everyday, so i don't know how i could do for her.. what do you suggest?","Doctor":"Most often loose motions in children is caused due to certain viral infections. Rotavirus is one of such viruses, but not the only one. But presence of some amount of blood could indicate a bacterial infection that might need treatment with antibiotics. If the child is active and fine there is perhaps less cause to worry but I would insist you to get a routine microscopy of stool done. If the results indicate increased pus cell count, it could indicate a bacterial infection and could require to be treated with antibiotics like Ofloxacin. But in case pus cell count is normal, there is no need to give antibiotics and there is less to worry about. Giving ORS (oral rehydration solution) to prevent dehydration is important. It comes in ready made form or may be prepared by mixing a full sachet in the designated amount of water. Replenishment of the lost water and salts as the mainstay of treatment. Treatment is not supposed to bring down the frequency of passage of loose stools. The adequacy of the hydration would be evident from the frequency of passage of urine.

Most often such infections are associated with allergic reactions. Giving some antiallergic like cetirizine syrup for a few days should help in relieving the problem. Levolin is a bronchodialator and is meant to reduce wheezing. So, you can give Levolin only if you feel that the child has respiratory distress or wheezing. You can be patient and observe the child since such episodes usually last for 5-7 days irrespective of treatment. Give paracetamol in case the temperature rises.

Irrespective of treatment, such a condition generally lasts for a week or so.

Steam inhalation is a good home alternative for nebulization while the medicines might be continued.

It is frequently in children and usually no side effects are observed since it is delivered directly to the target organ without requiring to get mixed in the blood stream. If side effects are to occur, it primarily includes increase in heart rate. Do not worry, it is safe to be given to children.The fever is due to the respiratory tract infection that is frequently caused by certain viruses and irrespective of use of medicines, it usually takes 5-7 days for the fever and cough to resolve. Give paracetamol to bring down the temperature. You would have to be a bit patient.A very good home remedy of cough is steam inhalation. Just place the child before a source of steam. The water vapour will be in the air and automatically the child will breathe it in.

The treatment could require antibiotics, the choice of which depends upon the suspected causative agent. The splenic enlargement could be a sign of certain infections but it is hard to comment on this from such little details.

May be the bacteria were killed off by the boiling but the toxins are heat resistant and remained to cause the projectile vomiting that you mention. So, it could indeed have been the cause of the child vomiting.

Can you please tell me what to do?","Doctor":"As such dark brown vomitus could indicate presence of altered blood which could be a cause of concern. It could mean bleeding somewhere in the gastrointestinal tract. It is hard to comment on the treatment without knowing the specific reasons for the gastro-jejunostomy tube to be put.

Most often such infections are associated with allergic reactions which can be responsible for sneezing. Giving some antiallergic like cetirizine syrup for a few days should help in relieving the problem. I would not be separately concerned about the sore throat which is likely to be related. You can be patient and observe the child since such episodes usually last for 5-7 days irrespective of treatment. Give paracetamol in case the temperature rises.

Most often such infections are associated with allergic reactions which can be responsible for runny nose. It may also be associated with increase in temperature and muscle fatigue as in her case. The muscle fatigue is more likely to be the cause of her eye pain as well as her knees hurting. Giving paracetamol should provide relief for both fever and muscle pain. Giving some antiallergic like cetirizine syrup for a few days should help. Also give her steam inhalation. Water in the form of vapor reaches deep into the lungs and helps in diluting the cough and provides relief from dry cough.

Fever with rashes and cough are frequently due to certain viral infections. The rashes could be due to an allergic reaction which is often seen in a viral infection.

It is safe but the main problem it can cause is excessive sleepiness.

If the results indicate increased pus cell count, it could indicate a bacterial infection and could require to be treated with antibiotics like Ofloxacin. But in case pus cell count is normal, there is no need to give antibiotics and there is less to worry about. Giving ORS (oral rehydration solution) to prevent dehydration and giving paracetamol to bring down the temperature if it exceeds 100°F, is more important. You may also give some amount of yogurt/curd as it contains beneficial bacteria as in bifilac. Since her activity is normal, there is less cause to worry.

It may persist in some children. That seems to be the case in your child. It is normal and does not require treatment. All you have to do is to give ORS (oral rehydration solution) to prevent dehydration from developing. Antibiotics like oflomac are unlikely to be of help but if you have started it please complete the course. No medicines or precautions are required if the child is active and fine. But if the child grows lethargic you will have to take the child to a doctor without delay.For the diaper rash, you will have to keep the area open to air and let it remain dry for some time. It occurs due to excess of moisture. Application of some emollient or ointments like Siloderm Mixi should provide relief."},{"Patient":"My elder brother is suffering from abdominal pain from last 25 years. In childhood frequency of pain once or twice in year. it was curable with hyoscine, metronidazole or ciproflxacin. From last two months he has continuous pain, heart burn . No relief with previous therapy. All sort of treatment (for ulcer , colitis ) have test given by doctors but no benefit. after extensive diagnosis of blood, urine, xrays, ultrasound, colonoscopy, now doctors are suspecting intestinal TB. treatment of TB has been started but still no satisfactory condition. Doctors are used to inject esomeprazole to lower acidity but it works for few hours only. Kindly suggest me the ways to follow","Doctor":"Hello, mna19bwp, You state that his problem has been present for over 25 years. Continuous pain and heartburn still indicates acid sensitivity. I am assuming he is still currently on oral PPI, since injectable Esomeprazole gave him some relief. He should be taking the medication twice a day, 20mg twice about an hour before his big meals. I am sure he has been told to cut back on caffeine, alcohol,tobacco products, tomato based foods, avoid too much dairy to control the acidity. I am also assuming he has had an endoscopic examination of his espphagus and stomach with biopsy. He should have been tested and treated for H.pylori bacteri which is responsible for duodenal ulcers and inflammation of the stomach lining, chronic gastritis. Intestinal TB typically affects the junction between the small and large bowel and can present itself as a lump in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, low grade fever (Night sweats), fatigue and unexplained weight loss, may or may not be associated with diarrhea or bleeding. If all the investigations including blood tests were normal , other causes such as depression has to be considered. Hope they have done Celiac panel blood tests to rule that out. If your brother has had prior abdominal surgeries, chronic pain could be from adhesions or scar tissue and trapping of nerves. Sometimes, laporoscopy and exploring the inside of the abdominal organs may be necessary. Hope this gives you something to follow through. Wish your brother well."},{"Patient":"my 5 year old daughter swallowed a penny 3 weeks ago and I think the penny has passed( she has been regular) but she is complaining of a stomach ache and diarrhea today and some diarrhea last week can it be from the penny that might not have come out.","Doctor":"The penny will not cause diarrhea, rather some infection could be associated. But an X ray needs to be done to confirm that the penny has passed. The penny could get stuck somewhere and could give rise to abdominal pain.

The infection could be bacterial (Strep throat) or viral (as in mono or infectious mononucleosus). Since the fever is lasting for more than 10 days, I insist talking to your doctor about getting a Widal test done to rule out typhoid as a possible cause.

But to assess if things are fine, the first thing to look for is the amount of urine that the child is passing. If the child passes urine more than 6 times over a period of 24 hours, it indicates that the child is getting adequate feeds and there is not need to get concerned.

Unless associated with secondary bacterial infections, antibiotics are not required. Irrespective of use of antibiotics, it should take 5-7 days and you would have to be patient. Rather than giving Zincold, I would perfer giving paracetamol separately only when he has fever, and cetirizine syrup once daily at night for a few days. You may give Kufnil for 3-5 days. I would prefer stopping it after that. Giving ORS (oral rehydration solution) to prevent dehydration is important. Since most often the loose motions are caused due to rotavirus, antibiotics or any other medicines is not required. You may also give some amount of yogurt/curd as it contains beneficial bacteria. The cough and loose motions are probably unrelated and the cough will not get relieved as loose motion. They have occurred and would resolve independently."},{"Patient":"All over Abdominal pain yesterday, by evening it was most painful on lower right side. No fever.

But instead, giving some antiallergic like Cetirizine syrup is likely to be more helpful. Unless associated with secondary bacterial infections, antibiotics are not required but if you have started Azithral, you must complete the course to avoid development of antibiotic resistance. Irrespective of use of antibiotics, it should take 5-7 days and you would have to be patient."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor , I have a 3 year boy who has a strong mucus cough .

Recurrence could be due to reinfection or due to retention of the previous infection. Maintenance of proper hygeine can prevent reinfection. In case the problem recurs, I would insist you to get a routine microscopy of stool done. If the results indicate increased pus cell count, it could indicate a bacterial infection and could require to be treated with antibiotics like Oflomac. But in case pus cell count is normal, there is no need to give antibiotics. Rather giving ORS (oral rehydration solution) to prevent dehydration is more important. Also give plenty of yogurt/curd as it contains beneficial bacteria as in Vizylac."},{"Patient":"Hello sir, my son is 8 months old. he had loose stools with slight blood discharge 15 days back and has stopped and now he has fever not exceeding 99.5 F with runny nose and vomits after having food and also he has cough since 1 week.

They are not disturbing her eating habits and 200mg of ibuprofin usually takes away the pain. It is always in the upper left back of her head. They are occurring daily. The family dr said that it may be the result of a earlier concussion flaring. He said to watch her and see what happens. What do you think should be our next step?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read through your question.Typically, when there is a complaint of recurring headache, its a good idea to be seen by a pediatric neurologist. I make this recommendation no matter what the child's history.

If it is your appendix, you would most likely have rebound pain, basically what that means is that if you push on the area of pain it hurts worse when you quickly let go and let your stomach bounce back to normal.  If you are having this pain I would recommend going to the ER.  Stomach pain on the lower right side can be caused by a multitude of things.  Best best would be to go to your doctor and be evaluated for ovarian cysts, appendicitis, irritable bowel syndrome, crohns, gall stones, kidney stones.

I prefer PediaLax over MiraLax. However, I prefer lactulose more although it is a prescription medication. I doubt any connections between fever and lethargy with that of constipation. Rather, these symptoms are likely to be due to the recurrent UTI.The cause of recurrent UTI could be some sort of anatomical abberation which could be identified by a DMSA scan. Please discuss about the same with your pediatrician or urologist. Further treatment would depend on the findings.

Did the child have any convulsion when he passed out? The normal blood counts and CT scan rules out some common possibilities, but an EEG may still help.

The fever went away within 12-18 hrs.","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in children. For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.For cold you can use Cetrizine at 0.25mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days.For nasal block, plain saline nasal drops will do, every 4-6th hourly to relive nasal congestion.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

Do not put her in lying position after feeding till she burps out the swallowed air.2.

Unusually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds.  3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4. If you feel your feeds alone are inadequate for the baby, then Zerolac is the only option till 6 months age.

I do not recommend Deriphyllin for a kid of this age. There are better alternatives like Salbutamol or Levosalbutamol and in the form of metered dose inhalers. Inhalers are the newest management strategies for this. If I were your paediatrician I would have suggested the use of Budecort metered dose inhaler (100mcg) 2 puffs twice a day through a spacer and this is for regular use for 8 weeks. Another metered dose inhaler is Levolin and this can used as rescue therapy whenever the kid is having severe cough in spite of regular usage of Budecort. The technique is very important and very crucial for the drug to be delivered correctly to the lungs. Regularity of medicine usage also matters a lot. So do not discontinue abruptly after you notice some improvement. The technique of administering an inhaler using a spacer has to be taught to you by your doctor and these are prescription medicines.

Now after taking antibiotics she is OK eccept that when pressed on the upper abdomen she feels pain. The pain is felt even in lower abdomen also when pressed slightly. We are worried that may be the problem will reoccur again. When the problem starts she doesnt feel hungry and feeld extreme weakness. What should we do??","Doctor":"Hello, emailtogupta, I am not sure how young your wife is. Since different conditions cause different symptoms depending on the age and sex , it is hard to guess. However, based on the information you have provided, I think the doctor may be treating her for H.pylori infection that can affect the stomach and cause ulcer involving the duodenum.(Beginning portion of the small intestine). Usually, three antibiotics along with a PPI (Such as Omeprazole) are used for atleast ten days to cure this bug. If this is not treated properly, the infection will come back. The other possibility is some kind of gastroenteritis or infection caused by eating some contaminated food or drink. I think you should discuss this with her doctor and have her get some blood tests and also stool examination. There is a stool antigen test for H.pylori , if positive will indicate active infection that needs treatment. Lower abdominal pain, fever, diarrhea, can indicate Diverticulitis, inflammation of one of the pockets or pouches on the large bowel. This is more common after the age of 55-60. Hope this information helps your wife. Wish her well."},{"Patient":"Hi my son is now six and has lots of large open pores on his cheeks, since he had terrible acne as a newborn baby.

I suggest next masks:1.Two egg whites with the juice of half a lemon are blended. Apply this pack on the skin and leave for 10-15 minutes for a month.2.Papaya  helps in improving skin’s texture, elasticity . Mash to make a paste and apply.3.The vitamin C present in tomato can work wonders to clogged pores. Extract the juice from tomato and add with a little honey on it. Mix well and then apply this mixture on your face daily.4.Mixture of cucumber juice with few drops of rose water and apply the mixture onto the face. Leave for 15-20 minutes and wash your face.

I usually suggest such patients antihistamines like cetirizine or levocetirizine regularly for 7-10 days, depending upon response.2. I would also suggest her to regularly apply lotion like calamine over the itchy areas as well as over dry skin.3. Please do not scratch the itchy areas as scratching would only increase itching and hives. Please make sure that her nails are well trimmed.4. I also suggest my such patients to avoid too tight clothing or irritant clothing material like woolen clothes. Usually loose/comfortable-fitting, cotton clothes are better for patients with hives.5. If physical factors like temperature differences, warm water, hot/spicy foods/beverages, etc are aggravating her hives, I would suggest her to avoid them.6. If she has repeated digestive problems, I would also suggest my such patients a course of anti-parasitic drugs like albendazole or nitazoxanide.7. If she does not respond to above measures, I would suggest to get her investigated with basic investigations like complete blood counts, ESR, CRP, stool & urine examination, serum total IgE, etc. Which might help towards diagnosis.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to your daughter.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your daughter the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello.

Does he have fast breathing, difficulty in breathing, whistling like sound from chest (wheezing)?e. Does he vomit frequently?f. Is he routinely exposed to passive smoke, any other smokes/fumes/dusts or air pollution?Above details would help me to know more about your son and therefore to make suggestions for him more specifically.At present, from your provided history, I would like to make suggestions for him as follows:1. Foracort is a \\"preventive\\" type of inhaler. If he requires nebulization often, then regular foracort inhaler would help him to prevent repeated attacks of breathing problems.2. If he does not have frequent attacks, using \\"rescue\\" types of inhalers or nebulization with salbutamol or levosalbutamol will be useful.3. If he has nose problems, I would also suggest him to start montelukast + levocetirizine which improves nose symptoms.4. Regarding future asthma, no it is not always and cannot be predicted at this age. Usually most of the children improve by age of 5-6 years and do not develop asthma. However, some children may continue to have such episodes and they can develop future asthma. Such children usually have family members with allergies, are exposed to environmental pollutants/smoking, etc. 5. I usually also suggest my such patients allergy testing for common air-borne allergens like house dust mites, molds, pollens, insect proteins, animal dander, etc. However, detailed history is necessary before suggesting appropriate testing.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to your son.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"My 7 year old son has red rough rash on both hands around knuckles and both elbows were real red earlier but have gotten better.

Thereafter breast milk should be continued along with other semi solids. Cow milk or buffalo milk are produced for the nutritional requirements of their species. Requirements of human babies is different from theirs and hence human breast milk is the best possible feed for a child upto 6 months of age. Most formula milks are cow milk based and hence difficult for the child to digest. It might be the cause of the loose motions your child is getting. If the child is 6 months, milk is now an optional item of the food intake, provided that the nutrients are adequately procured from other food items. So, in case there is no breast milk and the child is 6 months of age, weaning with semi solids needs to be done and basically transitioned over to a mashed version of adult diet low on spices. I would not suggest giving any forumla milk of buffalo milk although some doctors might recommend a low lactose soy based formula."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctorsmy 5 years old daughter had been cough for months,see few doctors but after some timethe cough come back,the cough come mostly at night,but now during day time she cough alsoappreciate you can give me your professional advisethanks patrick","Doctor":"Episodes of cough and cold are caused most often due to certain viruses.* Some children have an increased propensity to catching cold and keep getting cough and cold recurrently. But the propensity comes down with age and you would need to be patient.* The cough has an allergic component which can be kept in control by the use of Montair LC (monteleukast+levocetririzine). Prolonged use might be required although off and on use might be also done based on requirements.* Also giving steam inhalation provides relief. Getting the tonsils checked is also important as underlying tonsillar infection often predisposes to catching cold."},{"Patient":"Hi I had helicobactor pylori 11 yrs ago and was treated for it, however, I continued to have reflux and ended up with a hernia repair.

Meftal P contains mefenamic acid and is effective in bringing down the temperature. 60 mg of Meftal P is ideal for your child of 15 kgs. OFM contains an antibiotic. Since you have started it you should complete the course. It might be hard to make a child eat when ill or when on such medicines like OFM (it contains metronidazole which affects taste). Giving a regular rice based diet high on green leafy vegetables, free for wheat and milk (for a week) is ideal for the child. A low fat and spice content is preferable.

Was the surgery the cause for this abdominal pain?","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. It is very hard to answer your question as you missed very important data like what kind of surgery was performed. Biopsy is not a technique for scar removal but for diagnosis. However pain which appears 6 months after surgery should not be caused by surgery (as long as it was not an abdominal surgery - such surgery can always result with intra-abdominal adhesions and intestines partial obstruction). Left side abdominal pain can be caused by left urinary tract infection or stones, diverticulitis, ovarian infection, ectopic pregnancy and many more. If your wife is suffering also from burning when urinating or frequent urinating than urinary tract infection can be the reason. If you wife has severe constipations diverticulitis can cause such symptoms. It is advisable for your wife to have abdominal ultrasound and fool blood work, pregnancy tests and urine tests.

While the one test we ve done thus far doesn t indicate the following foods, we suspect oats, eggs, nuts are also still contributors to his ongoing discomfort. Joey is not gaining in weight or length significantly - certainly not since I weaned him at 13 months old. He still looks small in the same pajamas he wore at 8 months old, and he still weighs only around 20lbs. I finally got my husband to look at his poop last night and he s extremely stressed as Joey (my son) poops 4-5 times per day some days, the stools are always very foul smelling, they always contain these funny white granules and large amounts of undigested food. Is it possible we re not looking in the right direction? Our physicians seem to follow our lead in exploring what s bothering my son, so no testing has been done on him to my ongoing dismay. Is it possible there s some sort of malabsorption issue and not all these allergies/intolerances?","Doctor":"Thank you glfor following up, your baby has malabsorbtion,caused by dysbiosis of intestine. It is really pity that you don't check your baby . I suggest you should give next baby's analysis:- stool culture for flora and sensitivity to a tibiotics- stool analysis-stool for ova and cyst-blood analysis- urine analysis   I would suggest to give your baby next treatment:1. For prophylaxis or for treatment-albendazol(zentel)10 ml once 3days in bed time2.Probiotic: Econorm(saccharomyces)1 sashe 2 times 3days3.Probiotics: Enterogermina 1 sashe 2times 10 days,then bifilac(darolac)1 capsule 1 time during 1 month4.Enzyme syrup during 1 month for good abbsorbtion of food .5.If your child were not allergic to vitamins i would prescribe him zinkovit 5 ml 1 time 1 month   I will be in touch to follow his progress.

Lower abdominal pain can be caused by several diseases including: urinary bladder infection, urinary bladder stones, uterine or ovarian infection, ectopic pregnancy, inguinal hernia and many more. If your symptoms are associated with burning when urinating it can be urinary tract problem, if your pain aggravates when caughting and the pain is localized in one side groin it can be inguinal hernia. As the pain itself does not suggest any of these diseases, the very first step for you should be physical examination by your doctor.

Giving it to her 2 times a dy is also a task. What do i do?","Doctor":"Hi...By what you quote I feel that your kid might be having a viral pharyngitis going on. It may be associated with cough too. Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in children. For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.For cold you can use Cetrizine at 0.25mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days.For nasal block, plain saline nasal drops will do, every 4-6th hourly to relive nasal congestion.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My six year old has been frequently going to urinate, sometimes 15 min apart.

Your patient has a highly elevated serum SGPT level. In this case you should go for total liver function test (LFT) which include total bilirubin, conjugated and unconjugated fraction, serum albumin, SGOT, SGPT and alkaline phosphatase level. Along with these you should also have hepatitisB surface antigen (HBSAg), anti-HBSAg, test for hepatitis c virus (ANTI-HCV), hepatitis A virus (Anti-HAV), Hepatitis E virus (Anti-HEV). Also wait for the other results to come which you have sent. It may be a case of viral hepatitis. If alkaline phosphatase and conjugated bilirubin is very high you should have an ultrasonography (USG) of abdomen. Keep the boy on bland diet, plenty of water per mouth and liver tonic and digestive enzymes until further diagnosis is reached.

Doctor has advised to give sporolac, but after sporolac, she passes formed stools, but by another 2 to 3 days, same process of loose stool continues.  Is it safe to give Ofloxacin and ornidazole.....","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.It seems your kid is having viral diarrhoea. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics like Ofloxacin or Ornidazole. Antibiotics are not indicated unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do. Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridges & soups.Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Health care magic are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer.

I am completely breastfeeding him. After feedings he vomits projectile mostly),sometimes its this thick slimy mucous like vomit. He goes a week or more without a BM(i give him apple juice after a wk). this is every feeding","Doctor":"Thank you for following up.It's common for babies to burp often in the early months as they adjust to feeding and introducing of new food and as their bodies develop. You can tell me when your baby is vomiting after birth or after introducing of apple juice.The sudden onset of vomiting is more likely to be caused by intestinal infection, such as gastroenteritis. This infection is often accompanied by diarrhoea.    Constant regurgitation may be due to pyloric stenosis, pylorospasmus, which is a rare condition. Pyloric stenosis is most likely to begin when your baby is a few weeks old, but could show up at any time before he reaches four months.

On Apr 2nd mid night, he even vomited 2 times at an interval of 3 hrs. There is no fever since Apr 3 night 9 PM (about 15 hrs now) We have shown him to a physician on 3rd. The diagnosis is URTI. So he has been given 1. Amoxilin - 5ml 3 times a day 2. Brufen - 10 ml 3 times a day 3. Panadol 3 times a day My son is 13 yrs old and his weighs 55 kg He has taken the above medicines last night and this morning. He now has no fever but is still complaining of severe pain in the eye ballls. He also had watery stools this morning, twice. Please let me know if the medication / diagnosis is right. He has no cold, cough and doesnt complain of pain in the throat too. The concern now is his weakness and severe pain in the eyeballs and light sensitivity. Please advise Thanks","Doctor":"Hello dear,   I have gone through the history points you have provided and also the treatment you have described. The choice of antibiotic therapy depends from form of URTI. We can suggest for URTI cefixime, ceftriaxon because these cephalosporins are a group of broad spectrum and directly affect E.coli,which cause inflammation in almost 80% of the times in children.    The watery stool is side effect of antibiotic,she has antibiotic induced diarrhea. Better to add probiotic Vizylac (lactobacteria) 1 capsule 1 time for 14 days.     I think eye pain  referred from areas of the head like as sign of intoxication. Severe eye pain is associated with her medical condition. It can be indicate also high intracranial pressure. After recovery i suggest she might require an ECG. Weakness is due intoxication also. Try to keep her hydrated with plenty of water. She will get better don't worry ,just use remedies for quick cure.      Hope i answered  your query.If you have any further questions I will be happy to help.      Wishing you good health!

I read and understand your concern. The most common cause of fever is viral infection, but we should differentiate respiratory, renal or intestinal infection.That's why you should take your child to a doctor and get him examined.Mefenamic acid is one of the most effective medicine for fever. It can be given to child every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100°F . For cold you can use anti-allergic medicines -cetzizine at 0.25 mg/ kg/dose every 12 hourly or allegra syrup 2 ml a day for 3-5 days.Give also tepid sponging as well.For rhinitis saline nasal drops and decongestant will do 3 times a day to relieve nasal congestion.Your son has fever more than 5 days ,that's why I would suggest you to give him antibiotic-azitral 100mg/5ml in the dose 10 mg/kg/dose once a day during 5 days(2,5 ml daily)-take between meal.Continue to give hot drinks,add sualin 1 tab 3 times for resolution.If temperature were normal you would take steam inhalation. Inhalation of steam humidies back of throat and really helps with the symptoms of throat infection. For increasing immunity and appetite you son can take multivitamin-zincovit in the dose of 5 ml daily during 1 month     Viral infection takes 7-10 days to get better. He will get better,don't worry,just use remedies.I wishing your son speedy recovery. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help.

I am happy that you were cleared of appendicits and ovarian causes. I hope you got CT scan to get that ruled out. If anything else major causing your problem, that would be shown in the CT scan. Also, as you know, the urinary tract information can also cause abdominal pain that should be resolved after it is totally treated. I would recommend you to keep yourself hydrated enough if this is the only problem. The other reasons in an young woman to be considered for abdominal pain are irritable bowel syndrome and any muscle spasms. If it is a irritable bowel syndrome, the abdominal pain is more likely to be associated with alternating diarrhea or constipation and may be related to any stressful factors in the life. If it is a muscle pull that is causing your back and abdominal pain, it might get better with warm compressions or a muscle relaxant which you can get after seeing your primary care physician. At this stage, I would recommend you to keep hydrated and finish the course of antibiotc for uti. If it does not get better after a couple of days, may be you may have to be re evaluated by your primary care physician for possible other causes as I discussed above.

This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in air too. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if she is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief.The two best ways to relieve this distress is - 1. Do not put her in lying position after feeding till she burps out the swallowed air.2. If she is still crying - put her in prone position and keep patting her back gently so that she passes off the flatus and gets relieved.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

But the at the same time I would like to draw your attention to investigate the reason as to why he fainted at the first instance. It could be a seizure or complex partial seizure which might have caused this fainting attack in him. I suggest you get an EEG done and ascertain that it is or not a seizure.

Would just like to know when is best to see a health care provider. She doesn't have any other cold like symptoms.Regards","Doctor":"Irritability in a child usually indicates some discomfort. It could be anywhere. Generally children develop irritability when they suffer from conditions like colic due to abdominal distention. It can be due to excess air entering the stomach during feeding. Proper burping in the form of keeping the child upright for around 20 mins after each feed, should help.Teething and gum irritation could be another possible cause. In such a case, gentle massage over the gums with a finger or giving her hard rusk (sugar free) or teething belt to chew upon, is helpful.It might be worthwhile visit the healthcare provider right now since the irritability is on the rise. They will be better able to assess if any other possibility needs to be considered.

He has a history of amoebiasis when he was 3 months..he is now 1 year old and 5 months.Could it be that he is suffering again fron amoebiasis or just because of his running nose?","Doctor":"Thanks for asking on HealthcareMagic.Generally the conditions are caused due to certain viruses and are self correcting unless associated with bloody diarrhea. If the stool is blood stained, it is more likely to be caused due to invasive bacteria like Shigella and certain variety of E.coli. Amoebiasis is a condition caused by certain parasites like Entamoeba or Giardia. These are less frequent. In fact, viral causes are more frequent but are are unlikely to be associated with steaks of blood as in this case. It is unlikely that unless backed up with definite investigation that the previous cause was amoebic (since other causes are more likely). Even in case it really was, chances of it being due to the same cause is very low.Runny nose, fever and cough are likely to be unrelated to the cause of blood streaks in stool. It is generally due to certain viruses. Runny nose would not cause bloody stools."},{"Patient":"My 10 1/2 month old recently started with loose grayish colored stool 3-4 times/day, and is not eating as well as usual.

But it can also occur due to change in food habits. I would not suggest stopping breast milk before 1 year of age provided that there is adequate flow. In case of inadequacy, the situation is different and there is no other way out. Semi solids need to be given. But if the child is vomiting it out, I think that you should get a medical consultation in order to assess for conditions like liver pathology or intestinal obstruction that could cause such vomiting and gray stools.

It also has a diurnal cycle i.e. counts vary during a 24 hour day. Normally they range from 4000 to 10,000 per mcl in an adult. The counts may go up due to an increase in any component of the white cells i.e neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes , eosinophils or basophils . This can be judged by a differential leukocyte count.

But the high temperatures need to be desperately brought under control. If acetaminophen does not seem to be very effective, Meftal P syrup should be given. It contains mefenamic acid which is more effective than acetaminophen. But it is a prescription medication and you need to get it prescribed by your doctor. Give tepid sponging as well. It will also take care of body ache and headache. You need to give steam inhalation and some anti-allergic medicines during the episodes since it is associated with some allergic component.You should take the child to a doctor and get him examined especially if the fever lasts for more than 7 days or if the child becomes lethargic.

Dexpoten contains dexmethorphan which is a cough suppressant.

Generally the condition is self correcting and does not need to be treated with antibiotics. You need to give steam inhalation and some anti-allergic medicines during the episodes sine it is associated with some allergic component (although you might not not be aware of it). Give tepid sponging as well as paracetamol to bring down the temperature in case of fever. Some children are more prone to such infections. However, the propensity comes down with increase in age. Not much can be done about the frequency. However, tonsillar infections can increase the frequency of such infections and might need to be checked for. When you visit a doctor, ask him to check the tonsils as well.

You can give any analgetic -ibuprophen or paracetamol. Ask your baby to rince mouth with chlorhexidine or listerine with water 1:1 after each meal. Give to him only blended food, avoid sour drinks.

Generally the condition is self correcting and does not need to be treated with antibiotics, unless associated with bloody diarrhea. Your doctor has decided to play safe and has decided to give Ornoff-Oz. However, if the child does not tolerate it well and vomits it out, you can stop giving the medicine altogether. I would not prefer giving him another 1/2 tablet.You may also give plenty of curd or yogurt. It contains plenty of beneficial bacteria, same as that contained by Bilfilac, and is supposed to be helpful in such a situation.Give ORS (Oral Rehydration Solution) and plenty of other fluids. Replenishment of the lost water and salts as the mainstay of treatment. Treatment is not supposed to bring down the frequency of passage of loose stools. The adequacy of the hydration would be evident from the frequency of passage of urine. If that seems to be fine, you need not worry.  But unless the child grows lethargic, I would not get concerned. It may still take 3-7 days (from the onset) to stop. You may give zinc supplementation with Zinconia Syr 2.5ml twice daily for 5 days. It will help in the intestinal healing as the diarrhoea causes some damage to the inner wall of the intestines. It is preferrable to avoid milk and wheat based items for a week or so (curd or yogurt can be given)."},{"Patient":"sir,my son now 4 weeks age,he had erbs palsy because of difficult delivery,his left shoulder have the problem,however he moves his fingers , wrist and good grip also.tomorrow we will start physiotherapy.sometimes he moves shoulder also,let me know my son will recover fully from this situation,kindly give suggestion about further treatment.thanks,nasim from dubai","Doctor":"Hi...Erb's palsy requires only physiotherapy for the management and as you mention he is moving his fingers it is a good sign.

It s almost a bruised feeling upon taking a deeper breath.","Doctor":"Dear friend, welcome to HCM! With a gall bladder problem, such constant pain on deep breathing could be due to a gall bladder pathology or others like early pancreatitis. Especially if it is increasing with deep breathing, dull aching, constant pain, also going to the back,  we should look at the pancreas. You will need a good physical exam and labs (like serum lipase, LFTs) and USG to elucidate the cause. Is there any nausea, fever, fast heart rate?

Should this be a concern for me or is this normal at 11.","Doctor":"Hi...testicles hanging far or near to the body will depend on the ambient temperature changes.

In your child, environmental factors may also play a role.

Again the boils diminished, but a week later I now see what appears to be a small pimple forming in the exact same spot as a previous boil. It should be noted that the previous boils never came to a head so the doctor was unable to culture them. We are assuming staph/mrsa based on appearance only.

Other preparations should correspond to 4 to 12 mg of alliin or approximately 2 to 5 mg of allicin, an active constituent of garlic. However, dosage is complicated by the volatility and instability of important constituents in various products (eg, aged extracts, deodorized garlic, distilled oils). Take garlic preparations with food to minimize stomach upset. Dosage will remain a matter of personal tolerance.You start from to 2 gr 2 times with food 7 days then see effect.

Irrespective of use of antibiotics, the condition (in either case) takes 5-7 days to resolve. Till then management is supportive and you need to give paracetamol to bring down the temperature.

In other words, there could have been bleeding in the gastro intestinal tract due to some cause. Gastritis is a common cause but it needs to be evaluated. Although the new formula could have a role, I do not think that we should jump to conclusions. But nevertheless, it might be wise to stay with the previous formula as of now.

It often occurs during an episode of cough and cold. It is generally caused due to certain viral infections and is self limiting, resolving in 5-7 days.

She was under bili lights for 2 days Her going in level was 19. (bilirubin level), the next day it was 20. The last night it was 14 and again tested today morning it is up to 19! What could be causing it?What could this mean for her","Doctor":"Before birth, the fetus has a higher hemoglobin level as compared to the mother, so that she can extract oxygen from the mother's blood. This extra hemoglobin is no longer required after birth. Bilirubin is a hemoglobin break down product and therefore produced in increased in increased amounts after birth. However, in case of some mismatch between the blood group of the mother and child's blood (ABO or Rh incompatibility), hemolysis may be triggered leading to increased bilirubin levels. So, this condition needs to be checked for. Another thing that could cause increased bilirubin levels is a child of this age, is lack of adequate feeds, giving rise to what we refer to as breast milk jaundice which occurs due to dehydration. Increased amount of feeding along with phototherapy is right to be given. If the bilirubin levels rise even higher, exchange transfusion might be required. But usually the condition resolves with phototherapy and the child is expected to be well soon after.It is normal for the bilirub"},{"Patient":"My 15 week old son had pooed 4 times today each time it has got white lumpy bits in and the smell is horrendous I can hardly breath he's eating as normal no temperature and seems fine in himself he obviously doesn't have solids anymore and he's on the same milk he has always been on","Doctor":"Thank you for consulting in Health care Magic, these white lumpy bits are undigested particles of  food- may be potato or any starch from carbohydrate.

Headache and neck pain during viral illness is quite common. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

But lips turning purplish is unusual and cannot be left like this. I suggest you take her to the nearest emergency room as soon as possible.But I will tell you certain facts regarding viral illness - Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My 3 year old son had cold and cough in d 1st week of Feb..Dr. Prescribed azithral 200 for 4 days..now after 3 weeks he has got cold & fever again..he also has wheezing problem..d Dr. initiallly suggested azithral for antibiotic..

No point in using antibiotics for every cough and cold. these are mainly allergic and not infectious and antibiotics are not going to help. Your kid could be having viral associated wheeze or multi triggered wheeze. I have a few questions for you -Questions:1. How many days per month does she cough or feel breathless?2. How many nights per month does her sleep get disturbed due to above symptoms?3. Does she feel breathless when she runs around or plays with other kids?4. Are the symptoms when there are seasonal changes?5. Is there any family history of asthma or any other sort of allergies like skin allergy etc.?6. Is the cough always associated with fever?If your answer is yes for any of the above questions, your kid might be having viral associated wheezing or multi triggered wheezing and I suggest you meet a paediatric pulmonologist who is near your place. No point in using antibiotics every time. It will do more harm than good by increasing bacterial resistance."},{"Patient":"my two year old grandbaby has been throwing up since tuesday which was her second birthday, she was feeling fine on yesterday but woke up this morning with vomiting all over again . she really does not have an appetite she does not want to drink any more pediatyle can i give her sonething to eat","Doctor":"Hi...by what you quote I feel that your kid might be having a starting stage of diarrhea which usually starts with vomiting and then progresses to diarrhea. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi there, my 9 yr old daughter has been unwell since 12th nov. this started 6 days after her nasal flu spray she was given at school.

She immediately began crying and did so for about 3 minutes while we comforted her and then complained of neck pain for about 20 minutes afterwards, all while resuming playing with her toys, eating snack, and running around the house. I should note that she did NOT hit her head, as we were able to catch her in time, but her neck bent back pretty far. She went to sleep fine about an hour later, playing peekaboo and in a good mood. About 5 hours later, she woke up in the night (as she has been doing lately) and when she was walking around, we noticed she seemed stiff legged. When we asked her if anything hurt, she started touching her right leg and saying ow but also did the same thing with her left arm. She did not react to us touching either, nor did she react to us touching her neck at this point. Is this a sign of a neck injury that she could have suffered or is this to be expected after perhaps straining something? Our pediatrician s office opens in a few hours and we re planning on calling but have been nervous wrecks all night!","Doctor":"Thank you for following up.It seems she really hurts her neck, that's why we should differentiate bruising,fracture,tear of ligament and etc.For excluding fracture you should visit orthopedic doctor and do X-ray of cervical part of spinal cord in 2 proections or MRA according of diagnosis of doctor.

From the 6th month, inclusion of semi solids into diet would be advisable."},{"Patient":"My son just turned three on september 30, 2014. He complains alot about pain and I always thought he was just trying to get attention or maybe just saying it because i have chronic arthrtitis pain and he always hears me say im hurting and then his dad will rub my neck. For the past month or so he has been telling me that his left leg hurts and he always wants me to rub it but there is no brusing or anything and he hasn t injured it. he also gets fevers often and vomits often. Should i be worried. For some reason the word cancer keeps popping up in my head.","Doctor":"The mentioned pain could be growth pain wherein your child could have genuine pain and not be crying for attention. Chronic arthritis is not relevant at this age. Cancer does not seem relevant for the mentioned details.The cause of frequent fevers and vomiting needs to be evaluated although I do not think it to be something severe and. Please do not worry. Please visit a pediatrician and get your child assessed."},{"Patient":"Hello my soon 2 1/2 year old has been sick about a week really bad chest congestion runny nose really bad cough at night the past 2 nights her and I both getting maybe 2 hours of sleep between her coughing every. Five minutes to gagging and I tried the shower steamy restroom humidifier everything well today she is complaining of her tummy hurting and she pulled up her shirt to show me where and there is a small lump just above her belly button and below her rib cage what could it be?","Doctor":"Such symptoms are usually caused due to certain viral infections. It is usually a self limiting condition and resolves in 5-7 days irrespective of treatment. It is not a cause of concern. It is not possible to mention the cause of the lump without examining it. It needs to be clinically assessed. Please visit a pediatrician and get her examined.Giving steam inhalation and some antiallergic like cetirizine should provide relief. Giving paracetamol will help in bringing down the temperature. Give ORS or oral rehydration solution if the child has diarrhea.If the child is active and playful, things should be fine. However, if the child starts wheezing or becomes lethargic, or if the condition lasts more than 7-10 days - you would need to visit a doctor without delay."},{"Patient":"My 2 1/2 yr. old fell off the bed and hit his head.

They are:* Vomiting* Loss of consciousness or altered consciousness* Severe headache* ConvulsionsThese signs could indicate something serious.

It is not a cause for concern. Most formula milks are cow milk based and hence difficult to digest. Undigested food matter can be degraded by intestinal bacteria to give foul smelling stools. In case diarrhea actually occurs, it is generally due to a virus called rotavirus and is a self limiting condition. The reflux could be due to inadequate burping. You need to hold the bay upright for about 20 mins after each feed to prevent reflux from occurring."},{"Patient":"Hi, my 7 month-old baby has been diagnosed with gastric reflux since he was 2 month-old. He has been receiving omeprazole suspension for the last 4 months. Now, he does not want to eat. Do you think omeprazole is related with his loss of appetite? Thanks for your help.","Doctor":"The reflux could be due to inadequate burping. You need to hold the baby upright for about 20 mins after each feed to prevent reflux from occurring. Omeprazole is safe to be given and is unlikely to be related to the loss of appetite. Rather, the very condition of reflux is likely to be related to the cause of loss of appetite. Giving small but frequent meals should help."},{"Patient":"my   son is three month old.he had a cough and wheezing. my husband has asthama and the other two kids have allergic rhinitus. we are nebulizing him with atem and clenil both mixed with normal saline water. just concerned if this nebulizing will have any negative effects on the baby.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Atem (Ipratropium) and clenil modulite (Beclometasone) are medicines frequently used for nebulization. They are generally well tolerated and nevertheless important for relief of wheezing.

A month back one night, he suffered a bad asthma attack (with 60 breaths per minute) and we had go rush him to ER here in Chennai. We being first time parents didnt realise that a cough and cold could be so serious until he started having really heavy breaths. So far we had taken only body temperature increase, seriously. We still feel ashamed and sorry for taking him to the ER at the last minute. We dont want him to suffer like that again for sure. He was on nebs and ok within 24 hours and discharged within 48 hours. The docs mentioned that this could maybe be an allergy to something. He is an active child, we cannot cut him off from totally off from few triggers like dust, pollen etc as he daily plays for atleast 1 hour outside. But we have cut off all cold products from his diet. My question is again he has got chest congestion 45 days after the first time, but breathing so far is only 20 breaths per minute. His coughs sound heavy with phelgm in his chest. I know that this is the time to act. The docs told to use saline water for treating blocked nose. However to use levolin kit for low respiratory congestion. My big question is I have been avoiding the usage of levolin kit unnecessarily (or rather I naively I feel it is best this way). When the congestion becomes heavy, which is evident by the way he coughs, I have now started using this low respiratory medication. When best should I use this spray. Should I start when he starts coughing itself. Heavy Chest congestion seems to occur to him after few days (3 to 4 days) of what seems like dry cough. During this time we do give him saline solution to clear his blocked nose. Kindly advice when to start using lower respiratory medication. Thanks a lot.

We have been told it is vascular . What is your opinion on it clearing up as she grows?","Doctor":"The problem is not unique and occurs as the opening of the nasolacrymal duct has not yet formed. Most often the formation of the structure of the tear secreting duct is complete, it is just the opening that is still not formed. You should massage the tear duct of your baby. Use gentle pressure with your finger on the outside of your baby's nose and then stroke downwards towards the corner of the nose. This should be repeated several times a day. This can help to clear pooled tears in the blocked duct. It may also help the tear duct to develop.I do not think that it has vascular origin. It should clear up long before she grows up.The swollen vein is unrelated and needs more evaluation. The cause could be vascular or something else.

Since he was 1 yr. he had been suffering from constipation. by consulting with a doctor he prescribed laxopeg syrup. but he totally depends on that medicine. he is very well when takes it otherwise not. pl. help me to cure it permanently .thanks.","Doctor":"The cause of constipation needs to be evaluated. The bowel movements are responsible for moving the food down through the gastrointestinal tract, as it gets digested, and eventually leads to the expulsion of stool. When there is stagnation due to some reason, constipation occurs. Formation of bulk, gets the stool going. The primary mode of action of laxopeg (polyethylene glycol) is through the osmotic effect by absorbing more water into the intestines and forming bulk. This bulk is essential. In normal circumstances, unabsorbed dietary fibres form this bulk. So the permanent solution would be to give plenty of fibre rich food stuff like green leafy vegetables, unless some other underlying problem is diagnosed."},{"Patient":"7 year old sick hi  my 7 year old son has high fever with cold hamds and feet he has diaheria and he also feels sick i have given him paracetamol but its not too effective i got scared because he was asleep and woke up confused staring strangely and talking stuff that didnt make any sence please help me what is this and what can i do.","Doctor":"Fever, cold and diarrhea are usually caused due to certain viruses. It is generally self correcting. But if there loss of water and salts is more than the replenished amount, dehydration may occur which may manifest with cold extremities (shock) and confusion. You should rush the child to the emergency of a hospital without delay. He might need treatment with intravenous fluids."},{"Patient":"Hi Dr.My son had frequent and smelly stool past 3 days. We had given O2 and Enterogermina.Yesterday he had normal stool and then we stopped O2.  Again he has stool twice and the last one was smelly. Not sure if we need to start the O2 again or what to do as next step.Thanks,,","Doctor":"You have not mentioned the age of the child. The cause of such symptoms could be a gastrointestinal infection for which O2 had been prescribed. When you start an antibiotic, make sure that you complete the full course of 5 days. Otherwise antibiotic resistance may develop. You have not done the right thing by stopping it. I would insist you to complete the remaining course.Be sure to give oral rehydration solution (ORS). Also give curd or yogurt."},{"Patient":"my 15yrold grandson  has become  extremely thin over the past few months. he has become lethargic aand complains about not feeling well. He has had a fever and cough on and off and staggered and fell in a store.  At that point he was diagnosed with mono .Bloodwork showed he had been exposed to mono.  He still looks pale and tire easily.  He is also still very thin. Does he have active mono or is this maybe something else after all these months?","Doctor":"Mono or infectious mononucleosis refers to a viral sore throat caused by a virus called Epstein Barr Virus. It is usually a self limiting condition and needs to be treated with gurgling with lukewarm water. Usually the condition resolves in 5-7 days but may occasionally take longer. It is very unlikely that he has been having active mono for last few months.This being thin, pale and weak is probably unrelated and needs further evaluation before the cause can be commented upon. Lethargy necessiates such an investigation. Treatment will depend upon the cause."},{"Patient":"My child is 4 years old and has hypotonia.     It has mostly affected his mouth muscles and he has been able to keep up.    He had sleep apnea and we felt it was corrected after tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy.     Much improved.   However recently I just noticed that when he is sleeping he is pointing his toes and bouncing his legs up and down.    Should we be concerned about seizures.   He is asleep during this.","Doctor":"The baby's having hypotonia increases the possibility of seizures even further. It is possible that the child suffered from lack of oxygen (birth asphyxia) or has other associated neurodevelopmental factors which could be related to seizures. The child needs proper evaluation in developmental terms. Early detection and early intervention is necessary to limit disabilities from occurring."},{"Patient":"my one year old has ear infection. wont eat but takes liquid sip at a time..throwes up everything his fever is bout a 100..first visit to hospital was subscribed amoxicillian he got worst then subcribed clarithhromycin but doesnt take it cuz the tatse n makes him vomit..so made personal choice back to amocillian..holds it down but vomits later..not sure if its working at all","Doctor":"Ear infection is usually due to certain bacteria and can usually be treated effectively with either amoxycillin or clarithromycin. If the child is accepting amoxycillin, giving it should be fine. The fever or the ear discharge may last for a few days. No need to worry about it. Also give paracetamol and tepid sponging to reduce the temperature.Alongside, if ear discharge is present, I would prefer administration of some antibiotic ear drop like ciprofloxacin. Talk to your doctor about it."},{"Patient":"I am getting lower left abdominal pain , sharp pain if I apply pressure! No pain from my back but it s uncomfortable sitting down and slightly to walk?

Treatment will not reduce the duration it lasts. ORS helps to prevent dehydration.If the replenishment of salts and water is equal to or more than the amount lost through stool, you need not bother. The prescribed treatment is proper. The stools should be OK in a few days.I would prefer giving Zinconia. It contains zinc which helps in the healing of the walls of the intestine that gets damaged in such cases.Hope I have answered your query.

The pain could be related to gubernaculum, a structure that connects the testis to the scrotum. In any case it needs clinical evaluation and management. An undescended testis could develop cancer subsequently and hence needs to be removed surgically if there seems no further chances of descent."},{"Patient":"hi Dr. my 2 days newborn baby suffering from jundice of level 10.2gm/l ,baby is B+ve blood group of B-ve mother. suddenly jundice rise from 1.9 to 10.2 gm in 35 hrs . what should i do ? i have consult the doctor(child specialist) to day and he said come after 2 days to check blood group ...","Doctor":"Jaundice is frequently seen in newborns around 3rd or 4th day of life. It is physiological. But for a mother of negative Rh blood group with a Rh positive child, the jaundice could be due to Rh incompatibility. At the mentioned levels, treatment with single or double surface phototherapy should be enough. Phototherapy consists of a simple exposure to light of a certain wavelength and it helps in solubilisation of the bilirubin (which is responsible for causing jaundice) and thus it gets eliminated through urine. If the level rises even further, exchange transfusion with O negative blood might be needed. But most often, it resolves with phototherapy alone."},{"Patient":"my age is 33,my eye is twins from by birth,i check up in past days in shankara netryalaya chennai,ganpati hospital jalna,but dr says atfer operation we could not say the effect was good,i want to make my eyes normal view,so guide me,in life i face of many problem","Doctor":"It is not clear whether the problem relates to you or your child.It seems that you have double vision which could be due to a condition called strabismus. In such a case, a simple surgery to match the length of the muscles of the eyes on both sides (strabismus surgery) should help in correction of your problems.To comment on the exact nature of intervention, I would need to know about the problem in details.

Greenish stool occurs due to rapid transit of fecal matter through the large intestine where the bile pigments do not get adequate time to get converted to the yellow pigment of stool. It is not a cause of concern.I think that you can continue with the older formula but the importance of giving semi solid food is much more than giving milk formula which is now just an optional component of diet provided that the nutrients can come from other food items."},{"Patient":"I have a 23 month old grandson.

I am beginning to believe that this is because he is a medicaid baby and no one wants to spend too much time on his problem.  There is obviously a hepatobiliary problem here, how do I get someone's attention about it before he has permanent liver damage?","Doctor":"Tthanks for follow up.It is clearly see that your grandson has unknown ikterus. We have lots causes of ikterus-hereditary, carrot overeating, viral infection like as hepatitis A, B, diskynesia of bile ducts, obstruction of bile ducts.You should do deep examination,you should check blood test, liver function test, stool examination,stool for ova and cyst.

If you say that yiour pain jgets worse after you eat, you could have stomach ulcers.If you are a young man or a woman between 20-30 years of age, I think duodenal ulcer. If you are over 40+ years, I would think of Gastric ulcer, mainly because of location of the ulcer.These ulcers do not show up on ultrasounf.They may show up on an upper G.I.Series(x-rays).

Antibiotics are not required in viral illnesses and they will not help too. Viral illness is self limiting. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

White stool is caused by a lack of bile, which may indicate a serious underlying problem. Stool gets its normal brownish color from bile, which is excreted into the small intestine during the digestive process. If the liver doesn't produce bile or if bile is obstructed from leaving the liver, stool will be light colored or white.Often the problem occurs in the tube (duct) that delivers the bile to the small intestine. This tube can be squeezed shut or blocked — for example, by a tumor or a gallstone — which prevents the bile from entering the small intestine. Some babies are born with constricted bile ducts. Liver diseases, such as hepatitis and cirrhosis, also can sometimes cause white stool.  You should check liver tests and anti hepatitis A,B antibody"},{"Patient":"hi, in my country abortion is illegal, I m 8weeks pregnant; so i took four searle 1460 lastnight about 11pm , i started having cramps & mild bleeding with small clots(only after peeying) about 2am. at bout 8am i realized that the bleeding stopped. at 1030 am today i took four more pills and nothing happened. is my abortion completed or did it fail?","Doctor":"HI I CANT  SAY JUST BY FEW QUESTION ,YOU MUST VISIT A GYNECOLOGIST TO KNOW THE CONDITION."},{"Patient":"My 3-year old has started to develop a rash that appears a few hours after she goes to sleep.

I am trying to keep her hydrated but she had 9 loose motions today. Please help!","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.It seems your kid is having viral diarrhoea. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do. Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridges & soups.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

As you are after at least two abdominal surgeries, and there were some foreign body left in your abdomen, there is a 100% that you have a lot of adhesions in your abdomen. Gauze left inside abdominal cavity causes intra-abdominal inflammation and tissues irritation, what leads to many adhesions and intestines narrowness. So you probably are suffering from intestines obstruction as a result of this surgeries. There is no other way to get rid of it than surgery. You should have abdominal CT with contrast (so called enteroclisis) and probably you should have another surgery to get rid of this adhesions. Hope this will help.

I suffer from severe anxiety and it has become a lot worse since my cousin passed away on the 19th of last month. I have been having pain on the left side of my chest just under my breast and I m not sure if it s my heart or just my ribs also it feels like my stomach is rumbling but near my heart I also have palpitations where my heart all of a sudden has one big beat and feels like its going to beat out of my chest sometimes they are so bad it makes me jump out of my seat also when I listen to my pulse sometimes it sounds like it stops for a second (skips a beat) and then beats as normal. I went to the hospital last week and had an ECG which was fine. Do you know what this could be? Is it possible there is something wrong that the ECG didn t find? I am quite worried about this. Because of my anxiety I have lots of strange thoughts. I think I m always going to die and I find it extremely hard to sleep at night as I think if I go to sleep I won t wake up. I don t feel myself because of my anxiety. I feel light headed all the time and I find it hard to feel normal I always feel like there is something wrong with me.","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. According to your description, you probably suffer from heart arrhythmia. This is a condition when heart spontaneously beats irregularly. This is a very common heart condition. In most cases hearts gives an extra beat from time to time and after that beat, there is while for the heart to come back to normal rhythm. This is what you find a lack of pulse for a while. Such condition in most cases is harmless however it should be diagnosed and it is necessary to find what kind of arrhythmia it is. Moreover, pregnancy is very often associated with heart arrhythmia, and so is anxiety. So we can find pregnancy, anxiety, and ions shortage (especially magnesium and calcium) as an often reasons of such condition. Short ECG can not find it, you should have Holters 24 hours ECG, it should tell if and what type of arrhythmia you suffer from. To ease your symptoms it is advisable to have magnesium supplementation and visit psychiatrist if you can not deal with your anxiety.

Both myself and her father are on inhalers","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic. Greetings from Chennai.By what you quote I feel what your kid is having is asthma. Please don't feel that I am being blunt, but rather than using frequent steroids it is better to have a label and follow up with simpler alternatives than using steroids which are associated with complications. I have a few questions and suggestions for you -Questions:1. How many days per month do the kid cough or feel breathless?2. How many nights per month do the kid’s sleep get disturbed due to above symptoms?3. Does the kid feel breathless when running around or plays with other kids?4. Are the symptoms when there are seasonal changes?5. Is there any family history of asthma or any other sort of allergies like skin allergy etc.?Suggestions:1. There are certainly alternative management therapies in allopathy now-a-days. Medicine has advanced a lot and not asthma is 100% controllable.2. Inhalers are the newest management strategies for this. If I were your paediatrician I would have suggested the use of Budecort metered dose inhaler (100mcg) 2 puffs twice a day through a spacer and this is for regular use for 8 weeks. Another metered dose inhaler is Levolin and this can used as rescue therapy whenever the kid is having severe cough in spite of regular usage of Budecort. The technique is very important and very crucial for the drug to be delivered correctly to the lungs. Regularity of medicine usage also matters a lot. So do not discontinue abruptly after you notice some improvement. The technique of administering an inhaler using a spacer has to be taught to you by your doctor and these are prescription medicines. So I suggest you consult your paediatrician for this.3. Triggers can be environmental changes/ dust/ talcum powder/ seasonal changes/ un-cleaned a/c vents/ cold weather etc....we can specifically say this is the cause - unless we observe the kid closely - best person is the parent.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

She had a cat scan one week out with no bleeding.  She is now 6 weeks out and still has trouble with nausea, exhaustion, and light sensitivity.  She has not started back into any of her usual sports-soccer and running.  She also is doing little of anything to do with heavy mental work.  I have noticed lately that just before she starts feeling bad both of her pupils dilate- then she is exhausted and wants to lie down for a long time- hours.

Don t have any problems while eating / drinking etc. Nothing else seems abnormal. No fever , nausea etc. Nothing.","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. It sound like you are suffering from inguinal hernia. This is a condition when abdominal cavity contents are getting out through inguinal canal. This is caused by weak tissues and can be treated with surgery. So if you sometimes can find a lump in your groin, the pain appears when coughing inguinal hernia is very probable. However, if this one will be ruled out, abdominal ultrasound should be performed with fool blood work and urine tests as such pain may be also caused by urinary tract infection, urinary stones, diverticulitis, left ovarian inflammation and many more. But first, you should visit a surgeon so he can rule out inguinal hernia. Inguinal hernia can be easily treated by surgery. However, when not treated may cause intestines obstruction, so it should not be neglected. Hope it will help. Regards"},{"Patient":"My 3 month old has had diarrhea the past 2 days.

To calculate the amount of dietary fiber your child is getting  there is a good rule of thumb: Children should eat enough grams of fiber to equal their age plus five. (For example, a 2-year-old needs 7 grams of fiber each day.) It's also best if the fiber is distributed equally among your child's three meals, rather than eaten all at once.you can also use soy milk instead of regular milk to soften the stool.Hope this answer helps.RegardsDr. Shesh"},{"Patient":"Hi my son is 1 year and 11 months old he is suffering from loose motion, as prescribed by doctor we are giving him medicine but there is not effect in his health, Previously he has suffered from same problem that time another doctor has suggested fro Zinconia Syrup, kindly suggest we give this syrup to child.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Always start adequate supportive treatment for diarrhoea including oral rehydration solution, probiotics, zinc, b complex vitamins.As you are prescribed Zinconia syrup which contains zinc acetate (helps in case of diarrhea in children).If diarrhea doesn't stop by third day, I would advice to get a stool routine and culture test done to check for infection.Continue ORS therapy, suplemented in frequent small sips as much as child can drink.Hope I have answered your query.

During warm baths chlld complains of feeling cold. Mother has no computer access except in local library. Mother has worked as EMT years ago and fears meningitis. Doctor on Tuesday checked child s ears with care and saw no problem there. Please advise.","Doctor":"Hi...neck pain along with fever could be a simple viral illness or typhoid (meningism) or as the mother rightly suspected meningitis. But if the kid is active when the fever is down, you need not worry.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"I need help my daughter got lice back in September and I have done everything her doctor has told me to do, nothing has worked.

I just read through your question.Nose bleeds often occur because the mucosa that line the nasal passages get dry, crack, and bleed. This could be happening because of the asthma itself, or as a result of the Qvar. In either case, using Saline nasal drops 4-5 times per day will help alleviate the problem. The drops moisturize the inside of the nose so they don't dry out.

NO UTI - they also put her on an oral yeast medicine for three days in case it was yeast related and it did not help We then went to a pediatric urologist... they thought that it could be constipation as young little girls can hold their pee and poo at school and then cause constipation and can cause these vaginal complaints they did a xray it showed normal they also did an ultrasound that showed normal They wanted her to try Miralax anyway so we have been on that for 3 weeks. we have seen very little improvement. I actually think she is NOW constipated ON miralax... and has a hard time going since we began miralax I also had her seen by a gynecologist who did do a swab and it all came back normal The urologist said to keep on Miralax and then the next step would be do a cystoscopy under general anesthia... I would prefer to not do that as it has some risks Have you ever heard of a young child that suddenly gets vaginal itching and then says something hurts feels likes it pushing --she points to the top of her clitorius area We do NO bubble baths - she never sits in soapy water ...I use ALL FREE and Clear laundry detergent and Aveeno soap to wash her...we never wash her with soap down there. I m really desperate for help and answers... The urologist has her on Miralax thinking its constipation..which the xray showed NO constipation and she NEVER had constipation before.

It seems your kid is going through a viral illness. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day.

I don t think he had any dinner, just snacks.","Doctor":"Hello.  I just read through your question.The most common cause for lightheadedness is mild dehydration.

She s never had it before and if so how long should a temp last with cold before I go and see a doctor , she s been a bit moany and off her food but still managing to play ect","Doctor":"Hi...all the symptoms you are quoting are fitting into - viral illness. This looks like viral illness. Sometimes when the fever is remitting there will be a lot of sweating. Nothing to worry about it. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

Kidpred is indicated only if the kid is severely breathless and is in sever wheeze. Otherwise - Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in children. For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F.

An active is a well kid even if he is not eating well. 2. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone.3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day.4. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed his calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.5. I suggest you not to use appetite stimulants on long run as they may cause drowsiness.PLEASE DO NOT GIVE ANY SO CALLED APPETITE STIMULANTS AS THEY ARE NOT VERY SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN AND THEY HAVE THE SIDE EFFECT OF EXCESSIVE DROWSINESS.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

Does he have gastric disturbances like constipation, frequent stomach pain, frequent diarrhea, etc?f. Did he have any skin problems/allergies since birth?g. Does any of his family member have allergies?Above details would help me to know more about his health and therefore to make suggestions more specifically for him.At present, from your provided details, I would like to make suggestions for him as follows:1. As long as Tb and other chronic lung diseases are concerned, I would think about them only if he is almost always sick, he does not respond to nebulization and other medications, he has serious weight loss, etc. If he does not have above features, I would not think of any serious cause.2. Wheezing is very common in this age and there are many causes like allergies, viral infections (including bronchiolitis), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), childhood asthma (non-allergic), etc. So detailed history is important before suspecting a particular diagnosis and suggesting any investigations.3. I usually prescribe my such patients regular montelukast + levocetirizine which helps for most symptoms. If he develops wheezing, I suggest them nebulization with salbutamol or levosalbutamol on as-and-when-needed basis.4. Cold air, cold drinks and cold foods should be avoided in general, especially if they are aggravating his symptoms.5. Also, please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.6. It is usually true that around 70-80% of the children improve by the age of 6-7 years.Hope above suggestions and information will be helpful to you.To summarize, if your son does not have any of serious symptoms mentioned in point 1, I would suggest you not to worry.

It happens when during sneezing abdominal tension grows and pushes abdominal cavity contents. When in inguinal area it will find weak place, the contents will get out of abdominal cavity. You can check if there is a small lump in inguinal area. It can be present, or can appear when caught  or sneezing. Sometimes it can be visualized by inguinal ultrasound only. Of course it can be strained muscle, but inguinal hernia should be ruled out at first. You should visit your doctor and have ultrasound performed. Hope this will help.

There must be something(containing sugar )with the baby always and whenever she feels these symptoms,she should have that.The low vitamin D land calcium level can cause generalised body ache.I would suggest you to get her evaluated by a pediatrician to find out the cause and any investigation if needed should be done.Regards"},{"Patient":"My 5 year old has pimples on his face, mostly on chin, but one one his cheek and looks like starting a few more bumps on forehead.

The chances of closure of 7 mm atrial septum is 70 %. But if it is venricular septal defect the 7 mm defect usually does not closes on itself and surgery may be needed. In case of ventricular defect the surgery is done usually before the age of 9 months to prevent the damage of lung. The surgery can be done by device closure(without opening the heart) or by open heart surgery. The kind of surgery depends on the location of the defect.The proper growth of baby is very important as as baby grows the defect may become smaller.Regards"},{"Patient":"My 8 year old daughter has a very strong smelling urine.

Multiple episodes of severe, incapaticating mid- abdominal pain noted durin last 90-day period. Question: can either ascites, though minimal, or umbilical hernia trigger this type of pain? Bowel pattern normal and no change in dietary intake.","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. Yes, umbilical hernia can always be a reason of abdominal pain.  However, it can be also asymptomatic. Hernia is simply a hole in the abdominal wall. When the hole is small, but big enough to let intestine or omentum to get through, the contents of hernia gets squeezed and that is what hurts. So if in your belly button is a lump which hurts when you pres it, that can be the cause of your symptoms. If hernia is empty, it should not hurt at all. If it is about ascites, in most cases it does not hurt at all. The only way it can hurt, is when there is so much liquid inside your abdomen, that intestines gets squeezed and it can lead to intestine blockage. But it would be easily visible, and your abdomen would become unnaturally big, like with big ball inside. Hope this will answer your questions.

But my son had an x-ray 3 months ago. is it okay to have x-ray again? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read through your question.Though we try to avoid doing xrays in any scenario, there are certain clinical scenarios where it is necessary. Often we can make a diagnosis based on history and physical exam, but sometimes we need the help of an xray to make a diagnosis. I agree"},{"Patient":"My four year old daughter has very large tonsils there so large that they almost touch, the left side touches her uvula. They also have bright red veins at over them. She said her throat doesn't hurt at all. She sleeps with her mouth open and snores very loudly. Should I be worried?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read through your question.This is a very common problem. If she is sleeping comfortably, even with the snoring, there is really nothing to be worried about. However, if at any point during sleep you notice that she stops breathing for a period of 20 seconds or more before beginning her breathing again, it is a good idea to be evaluated by a pediatric ENT. Additionally, if she experiences recurrent infection in the throat, that would also be a good reason to be evaluated. Outside of those two scenarios, there is nothing to worry about."},{"Patient":"My eight month old grandson has had a cough for the past month.  The past 10 days, he's periodically sluggish with an occasional low grade fever.  One minute he's clingy and whiny and the next he's zipping around in his walker.  His sleep patterns are off.  He's had chest and nose congestion for a few weeks as well.  He's been to the doctor's twice and it's blown off as a cold.  Is this a normal amount of time for a cold for a child this age?  The only medicine suggested was Tylenol.","Doctor":"HelloViral respiratory infection upto 8-10 times a year is common in infancy. But if infection is severe enough so that hospital admission is needed then proper evaluation is needed. Symptoms of viral infection usually subsides within 7-8 days. If there is positive family history of allergy in family,allergic cause of respiratory distress should be ruled out.Symptoms due to hyperreactive airway disease(allergic) may persist for longer duration.Congestion and noisy breathing can be due to airway spasm. Nebulisation or oral bronchodilator helps in relieving the spasm.Nasal saline drops helps in relieving nasal blockade.You can give tylenol for fever.I would suggest you to consult your pediatrician for revaluation and management accordingly.Regards"},{"Patient":"My son aged 2.8, 15kg had fibrile convulsion yesterday due to high fever, he was very active and playing around but all of a sudden fall on the floor with convulsion. to reduce his temperature, I have given Maftal-P of 4-5ml. please advise whether I need to take him for MRI scan?","Doctor":"HelloThe most common cause of fever with convulsion in this age group(in a well baby) is febrile convulsion.The brain infection should be ruled out by proper evaluation. In case of febrile convulsion MRI brain is not needed as there is no anatomical change in the brain. The cause of fever should also be evaluated and treated.There is no specific treatment of febrile convulsion.The main aim is to control the fever to prevent the recurrence of convulsion as these child are prone to have convulsion during fever till 6 years of age.I would suggest you to consult a pediatrician for proper evaluation for the cause of fever and to rule out CNS infection.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi. my doughtier age now 6 years. her UCG report is Liver : Parenchymol echotexture slightly hypoechoic.Peri echogenicity is Increased.

Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding constipation -1. Natural methods are the best to relieve constipation.2. Constipation is a risk factor for UTI3. Maximum milk consumption per day should not exceed 300-400ml4. Minimum 3-4 cups of fruits and vegetables to be consumed per day5.

Loose motions could be due to teething or due to cold weather (no other symptoms of cold), not necessarily due to some infection. Please guide me.","Doctor":"HelloLoose stool (not mixed with blood and mucus) in this age group is usually due to viral infection. There is no direct association between teething and loose stool. The main aim is to prevent dehydration by giving plenty of fluids(ORS).Antibiotics have a little role in viral diarrhea.In many of the children there is transient lactose intolerance(inability to digest milk product) during loose stools. The amount of milk consumption should be reduced for few days if baby is not predominantly milk fed.Zinc supplementation and probiotics help in early recovery from diarrhea.Nor metrogyl contains combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole.The dosing is mainly based on norfloxacin. The doase of norfloxacin is 10- 15 mg/kg/day in two divided dosage.I would suggest  you to give plenty of fluids,along with probiotics and zinc.

As your daughter does not have much of fever, I would not suggest to give acetaminophen to her.2. For cough and nose symptoms, I would agree with use of saline drops frequently which would reduce symptoms.3.

Usually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds. As your baby is more than 6 months now - it is better to start rice based feeds. 3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4.

In this the breathing tubes will be slightly lax and they will get better as the age progresses. This is a quite common thing which is increasingly being recognized now a days. You need not worry if his growth parameters and development are normal. As far as diagnosis is concerned it is mostly clinical and the gold standard diagnostic test is bronchoscopy. Many a time this might be mistaken as wheezing, but careful examination shows that the noise is mostly inspiratory and not expiratory. Wheeze is usually expiratory.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My daughter has been getting little whit pimples on her legd and side of her stomache the pimples are surrounded by a reddish area and warmer to the touch then the rest of her body ..When u pop them the drainige from it looks like a boil.The red bump will appear befor the pimple...","Doctor":"Hi Based on your description,  they appear  to be skin infection.

I need to do some thing as i go back to work soon, Thank you","Doctor":"Hi Mother's milk is best for the baby.  If mother's milk is less,  I  usually give some medicines to the mom to increase milk production( Tab Perinorm 10 mg thrice daily for 3 days).  Also good diet including 2 eggs per day,  nuts  and fish thrice weekly increase milk production in the mom.  Sometimes breast pump can be used to express milk. If these measures fail,  then formula milk like Nan 1 can be given.   Formula milk if not prepared cleanly can cause infection.  Also formula milk lack protective factors   present in breast milk. Formula milk should be given with a spoon and NOT with bottle as bottle feeding increases chance of infection. Also one can start weaning foods like home made porridge ( preferred)  or  Cerelac  for the baby after 4 months of age. These foods have rice etc which  can be  filling to the child for sometime."},{"Patient":"My 2 year old daughter always complains of being too hot, it's minis 3 c outside and pretty chilly inside but she is refusing to wear clothes or a coat, it's very frustrating, could this be a sign of donething serious?

I feel that your baby is having cow's milk protein allergy. Unusually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds.  3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4. If you feel your feeds alone are inadequate for the baby, then Zerolac is the only option.

In viral illness it is quite common for the tongue to have some white patches. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days.

After going through your question in detail - this is my opinion and this is what I would have done if I were your treating pediatrician.Possibility -1. Cow's milk protein allergy is a strong possibility as there as blood in the stool in exclusively breast fed baby.Suggestions -1. Mother should go off the cow’s milk products completely - including biscuits and chocolates and all products related to milk.2. Continue exclusive breast feeding and if it is not sufficient you can opt for Zerolac.3. Cow's milk protein intolerance in transient as it will go off as the kid grows up.4. Avoid all cow's milk products till the kid is 1 year age.5. Mother's milk is the best for good growth of the baby.

This morning I woke up with a huge pain in my lower stomach area ( initially I thought it was period pain but it was far far too much pain even for that). I then became very hot, cold , sweaty, weak, nauseas, and out of it a bit. I went to the loo and had a bit of a bad tummy after about ten- fifteen minutes of lying on the cold bathroom floor writhing in pain. Now, lying down with a cold wet flannel on my head I feel a little better and the pain has gone. Is this just a bad tummy?! It s happened twice in the last 6 weeks, one was a whole day off work basically drifting in and out of passing out on the floor sweating and shivering . The other was an afternoon and passed like this. No allergies, no meds, and no link as far as I know between what I ate etc any help would be great. Thanks","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. Usually such strong pain as you have described might be caused by a stone sticked in ureter. This pain is described as sharp strong pain, radiating from back side to groin. It can be associated with symptoms like nausea, sweats and fever. This pain can come and go spontaneously as it only appears when little stone is migrating from kidney to urinary bladder. Abdomen ultrasound should answer if there are any stones in kidney (but no always does) and if there is any hydronephrosis. Urine tests might be normal when there is no symptoms, but recently after pain attack there should be some erythrocytes if you are dealing with kidney stones. Your symptoms might be also caused by ovarian cyst. Trans vaginal ultrasound should tell if there are any. If this two diseases will be ruled out, there are other possibilities, that is why full blood work should be performed, and abdomen CT if necessary. Hope this will help.

Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in children. For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.For cold you can use Cetrizine at 0.25mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days.For nasal block, plain saline nasal drops will do, every 4-6th hourly to relive nasal congestion.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Good day .

I believe it was 500mg... I m not sure. It was my Husband s, we are on vacation so he had some in a baggie. She watched me get a few tylenol out of a different bag for myself before, and probably thought it was the same thing. She is about 4 5, and weighs 105lb. Will she be ok? She s sleeping right now, should we just watch her?","Doctor":"Hello, Stomach aches and nausea on vacation may be due to many reasons. It may be due to improper diet. Sudden change in diet schedule etc. Naproxen is an pain killer and antiinflammatory drug. If your child's pain is like cramps she may need a anti-spasmodic drugs like dicyclomine or buscopan, if it is of burning sensation she may need a pantaprazole etc. Her pain is not associated with any vomiting and diarrhea, so probably she would be fine with the pain killer. Ask her to get plenty of fluids. If the pain is still presistent get her to a physician.

Young boy (age 10) swollen calf muscles on both legs and now beginning in arms. Not typical edema type (soft and spongy) but like a hardened muscle that is growing in size.
