The right-hand side segmented decimal fractions in the solution of problem 1302 are converted into the ratios of two natural numbers A / B and C / D, similar to the procedure seen in 1 1. The seventh decimal place of the first segmented decimal fraction marks the beginning of the infinite repetition of the 538461 segment. This is a consequence of the fact that when determining the digits of the A: B ratio up to 6.6538461 (and already subtracting the partial product of 1 with B from the partial dividend), the same remainder R reappeared as it did after determining the digits of the ratio up to 6.6, except that in the latter case, the local value of R is 1 / 10, while in the case of repetition, it is 1 / 10000000 = 1 / 10^{7}.

This is because any prime dividing both (b + p) and (b - p) must also divide their difference:   [   (b + p) - (b - p) = 2p   ]   Since (p) is an odd prime and (b) is even, neither (2) nor (p) can divide (b + p).3.

How much the number of rectangles can be?[i]I. Bogdanov, D. Fon-Der-Flaass[/i]","solution":"1. Restate the Problem:   Consider a square ( U = [0,1]^2 ) in the Cartesian coordinate system. The square is partitioned into rectangles by several segments parallel to the sides of the square. The conditions are:   - Any vertical line ( x = a ) intersects exactly ( k ) rectangles.   - Any horizontal line ( y = b ) intersects exactly ( ell ) rectangles.   - No two segments intersect at an interior point, and each line ( x = a ) or ( y = b ) contains at most one segment.   We need to determine the maximum number of rectangles that can be formed under these conditions.2. Construct a Configuration with ( kell ) Rectangles:   - Consider ( k ) horizontal strips, each divided into ( ell ) rectangles. This configuration results in ( k times ell = kell ) rectangles.   - This construction satisfies the conditions since each vertical line intersects ( k ) rectangles and each horizontal line intersects ( ell ) rectangles.3. Prove that ( kell ) is the Maximum Number of Rectangles:   - Lemma: Every segment ( s ) in the configuration has the same number ( a(s) ) of rectangles on either side of it.     - Proof: Without loss of generality, assume ( s ) is a vertical segment. Let ( mathcal{L} ) and ( mathcal{R} ) be the sets of rectangles to the left and right of ( s ), respectively. Let ( mathcal{X} ) be the set of rectangles that the vertical line containing ( s ) intersects. Consider two vertical lines (varepsilon) distance away from ( s ), one to the left and one to the right. These lines intersect the rectangles in ( mathcal{L} ) and ( mathcal{R} ), and both intersect the rectangles in ( mathcal{X} ). From the given conditions, ( |mathcal{L}| = |mathcal{R}| = k - |mathcal{X}| =: a(s) ). (blacksquare)4. Algorithm to Transform Any Configuration into the Trivial Configuration:   - Let ( N ) be the number of vertical segments ( s ) with ( a(s) > 1 ). The algorithm will decrease ( N ) in each step, eventually reaching a configuration where ( N = 0 ).   - If ( N = 0 ), the configuration is the trivial one with ( k ) horizontal strips, each divided into ( ell ) rectangles.   - Consider the vertical segment ( s ) closest to the left edge ( e = {0} times [0,1] ) with ( a(s) > 1 ). Let ( mathcal{L} ) and ( mathcal{R} ) be as defined earlier. Starting from any rectangle ( T_0 ) in ( mathcal{L} ), trace a chain of rectangles forming a 'tube' ( mathcal{T} ) until reaching ( e ). Form ( a ) such tubes ( mathcal{T}_1, mathcal{T}_2, ldots, mathcal{T}_a ).   - Let ( R_1, R_2, ldots, R_a ) be the rectangles in ( mathcal{R} ) from top to bottom. Rearrange the tubes ( mathcal{T}_i ) such that ( e_i ) continues in the edge between ( R_i ) and ( R_{i+1} ). Erase ( s ) and replace it with ( a ) new vertical edges to separate ( mathcal{T}_i ) from ( R_i ).   - This process maintains the conditions and decreases ( N ) by 1.5.

By the properties of reflection, (AD) is the perpendicular bisector of (BB').   - Since (B') is the reflection of (B), (B'C = AC - AB).   - Given (AB + AD = CD) and (AC + AD = BC), we can deduce:     [     B'C = AC - AB = BC - CD = BD = B'D     ]   - Therefore, (angle B = angle AB'D = 2angle C).3. Intersection and Angle Calculation:   - Let (E) be the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of (AC) and (BC).   - Since (E) lies on the perpendicular bisector of (AC), (AE = CE).   - Since (E) lies on the perpendicular bisector of (BC), (angle AEB = 2angle C = angle B).   - Thus, (AB = AE = CE), and hence:     [     DE = CD - CE = CD - AB = AD     ]   - Therefore, (angle DAE = angle DEA = 2angle C), implying (angle CAD = 3angle C).4.

Suppose ( B ) defeats ( A ) (i.e., ( B rightarrow A )). Since ( A ) has the highest out-degree, there must be a player ( C ) such that ( A rightarrow C ) and ( C rightarrow B ). Thus, ( A ) is skilled because for every ( B ) that defeats ( A ), there exists a ( C ) such that ( C ) defeats ( B ) and ( A ) defeats ( C ).3. Lemma 2:   For any player ( B ), let ( H ) be the subgraph consisting of players who defeat ( B ). If ( H ) is nonempty, then the player with the highest out-degree in ( H ) is skilled in the whole graph.   - Proof: Let ( C ) be the player with the highest out-degree in ( H ). By Lemma 1, ( C ) is skilled in ( H ). Suppose ( D ) defeats ( C ) (i.e., ( D rightarrow C )). Since ( C ) is the highest out-degree in ( H ), there must be a player ( E ) such that ( C rightarrow E ) and ( E rightarrow D ). Thus, ( C ) is skilled in the whole graph because for every ( D ) that defeats ( C ), there exists an ( E ) such that ( E ) defeats ( D ) and ( C ) defeats ( E ).4. Application of Lemmas:   - Let ( A ) be the player with the highest out-degree in the entire graph. By Lemma 1, ( A ) is skilled.   - Consider the subgraph ( H ) of players who defeat ( A ). Let ( B ) be the player with the highest out-degree in ( H ). By Lemma 2, ( B ) is skilled.   - Consider the subgraph of players who defeat ( B ). Let ( C ) be the player with the highest out-degree in this subgraph. By Lemma 2, ( C ) is skilled.5.

This leaves three possible positions for Sally, which we will call positions 2, 3 and 4 from the left-hand end. Were Sally to sit in place 2, neither Dolly nor Kelly could sit in places 1 or 3 as they cannot sit next to Sally and, since Elly must sit to the right of Dolly, there would be three people to fit into places 4 and 5 which is impossible. Similarly, were Sally to sit in place 3, Dolly could not sit in place 2 or 4 and the question also tells us she cannot sit in place 1 so Dolly would have to sit in place 5 making it impossible for Elly to sit to the right of Dolly.

Cubes that have exactly two faces painted are located along the edges, but not at the corners of the original cube. Along each edge, there are a-2 of them. There are 12 edges in total, so there are 12 cdot (a-2) of them.Let's count the unit cubes that have no faces painted. In the original cube, these are located in the interior, forming a cube with an edge length of a-2. There are (a-2)^{3} of them.Since the number 12 cdot (a-2) divides (a-2)^{3}, it follows that 12 = 2^{2} cdot 3 divides (a-2)^{2}. Therefore, 6 divides a-2.

Identify the principle of conservation of energy: In a frictionless system, the total mechanical energy (sum of kinetic and potential energy) remains constant. This principle can be expressed as:   [   E_{text{total}} = KE + PE = text{constant}   ]   where ( KE ) is the kinetic energy and ( PE ) is the potential energy.2. Express kinetic and potential energy:   - Kinetic energy (( KE )) is given by:     [     KE = frac{1}{2}mv^2     ]     where ( m ) is the mass of the cart and ( v ) is its velocity.   - Potential energy (( PE )) is given by:     [     PE = mgh     ]     where ( m ) is the mass of the cart, ( g ) is the acceleration due to gravity, and ( h ) is the height above a reference point.3. Analyze the relationship between kinetic and potential energy: Since the total energy is conserved, an increase in kinetic energy must correspond to a decrease in potential energy, and vice versa. Therefore, the velocity of the cart is maximized when its kinetic energy is maximized, which occurs when its potential energy is minimized.4. Determine the point of minimum potential energy: The potential energy is minimized when the height ( h ) is minimized. By examining the diagram, point ( C ) is the lowest point on the track.5. Conclusion: Since the potential energy is minimized at point ( C ), the kinetic energy is maximized at this point. Therefore, the velocity of the cart is greatest at point ( C ).[boxed{text{C}}]"},{"problem":"We have x_i >i for all 1 le i le n.

Understanding the Functions:   - Euler's phi function, phi(n), counts the number of integers up to n that are coprime with n.   - The sigma function, sigma(n), is the sum of the divisors of n.2.

Simplifying sigma(2^x):   - The divisors of 2^x are 1, 2, 2^2, ldots, 2^x.   - Therefore, sigma(2^x) = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ldots + 2^x.   - This is a geometric series with the sum:     [     sigma(2^x) = sum_{k=0}^{x} 2^k = 2^{x+1} - 1     ]4.

We start by observing that f is injective.

One of the brothers suggests that they tie the 3 goats with equally long chains and secure the ends of the chains to suitable points on the perimeter of the meadow, so that the goats can graze one-quarter of the meadow each, as allowed by the chain, and finally the fourth brother will mow what the goats cannot reach. However, another brother is concerned that the areas accessible to the individual goats will overlap.a) Show that this situation can be avoided.b) Determine by trial and error what percentage of the meadow's radius the chains should be. (It is sufficient to determine 2 significant figures.)","solution":"a) The sections of the meadow that can be grazed by individual goats do not overlap if, for example, the three tethering points of the chain are chosen as the vertices of an equilateral triangle (ABC) inscribed in a circle (k) that encloses the meadow, and of course, the length of the chains is such that each goat can only reach (1/4) of the meadow. We will show that circles centered at (A), (B), and (C) that are tangent to each other and have the same radius - or (AB/2) radius - cover more than (1/4) of the area of (k). Knowing this, it is obvious that by keeping the points (A), (B), and (C) unchanged and reducing the radius to less than (AB/2), a radius (varrho) can be found such that the circle centered at (A) (and similarly at (B) and (C)) with radius (varrho) covers (1/4) of the meadow, and there is no overlap.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_bd6b240496d6b0a63396g-1.jpg?height=589&width=512&top_left_y=459&top_left_x=793)Figure 1Let the circle centered at (A) with radius (AB/2) intersect (k) at point (D) on the shorter arc (AB). This point is not on the chord (AB), so it lies on the side of the perpendicular bisector of (AB) that contains (A). Therefore, if (F) is the midpoint of the arc (AB) (Figure 1),[angle DAB > angle FAB = 30^circ]Thus, the central angle corresponding to the arc of (k_1) that lies inside (k) is greater than (120^circ), so the area (t) of the part of (k_1) that lies inside (k) is greater than one-third of the area of (k_1):[t > frac{1}{3} pi left(frac{AB}{2}right)^2]The right-hand side is exactly one-fourth of the area of (k):[frac{pi}{12} AB^2 = frac{pi}{12} cdot 3R^2 = frac{pi R^2}{4}]where (R) is the radius of (k); indeed, by a simple calculation, (AB = R sqrt{3}).b) Let the length of the chain in question be (varrho), the two intersection points of the circle centered at (A) with radius (varrho) and (k) be (M) and (N), the center of (k) be (O), the midpoint of (MN) be (G), and (angle AOM = x) (measured in degrees; Figure 2), which we will approximate.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_bd6b240496d6b0a63396g-1.jpg?height=502&width=702&top_left_y=1904&top_left_x=687)Figure 2The part of the meadow that the goat can reach is divided into the segments cut off by (AM) and (AN) from (k) and the sector (AMN), and the former are obtained by removing the area of the kite (OMAN) from the sector (OMN). Clearly, (angle MAN = 180^circ - x), so the requirement, using symmetry, is[varrho^2 pi cdot frac{180^circ - x}{360^circ} + R^2 pi cdot frac{2x}{360^circ} - OA cdot MG = frac{1}{4} R^2 pi]where (MG = R sin x), and (varrho = 2R sin frac{x}{2}). Simplification in the first term is given by the following transformation using the right triangle (AMG):[varrho^2 = 2R varrho sin frac{x}{2} = 2R cdot AG = 2R(OA - OG) = 2R^2(1 - cos x)]since by the inscribed angle theorem, (angle AMG = angle AMN = angle AON / 2). Our equation thus becomes:[left(1 - frac{x}{180^circ}right) cos x + frac{sin x}{pi} = frac{3}{4}]and since (varrho < R sqrt{3} / 2), therefore[sin frac{x}{2} = frac{varrho}{2R} < frac{sqrt{3}}{4} < 0.4331, quad frac{x}{2} < 25^circ 40', quad x < 51^circ 20']The value of the left-hand side at (x = 45^circ) is 0.7554, which is greater than the right-hand side, and at (x = 46^circ) it is 0.7461, which is already smaller. The sought value of (x) is expected around (45^circ 35') based on the excess of 0.0054 and the deficit of 0.0039. The values of (varrho / R) corresponding to the chosen angles are 0.7654 and 0.7814, so only 77% and 78% are feasible.At (x = 45^circ 35'), the left-hand side of the equation is 0.7500, so this is the sought value of the angle, and to this (varrho / R = 0.7748), so to three significant figures, (varrho) is 77.5% of (R).János Kuhár (Budapest, Berzsenyi D.

Ordering the Positions:   - Every pair of neighboring birds is more than (1) meter away from each other if and only if (x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < ldots < x_{10}).   - Since every permutation of the (x_i) is equally likely, the probability that (x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < ldots < x_{10}) is:     [     P(x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < ldots < x_{10}) = frac{1}{10!}     ]7. Combining Probabilities:   - The desired probability is the product of the probability that each bird lies on a different segment and the probability that the (x_i) are in sorted order:     [     frac{10!}{10^{10}} cdot frac{1}{10!} = frac{1}{10^{10}}     ]The final answer is (boxed{frac{1}{10^{10}}})."},{"problem":"16.

Identify the given information and the goal:   - We have a convex quadrilateral (ABCD) with (angle ADC = 90^circ + angle BAC).   - Given side lengths: (AB = BC = 17) and (CD = 16).   - We need to find the maximum possible area of the quadrilateral.2. Analyze the condition (angle ADC = 90^circ + angle BAC):   - This implies that point (D) lies on the circle centered at (B) with radius (BA) because (angle BAC) is subtended by the same arc as (angle ADC) in a circle.3. Calculate the area of (triangle BCD):   - Since (B) is the center of the circle and (BC = 17), (D) lies on the circle with radius (17).   - Using the given side lengths (BC = 17) and (CD = 16), we can use Heron's formula to find the area of (triangle BCD).   - First, calculate the semi-perimeter (s):     [     s = frac{BC + CD + BD}{2} = frac{17 + 16 + 17}{2} = 25     ]   - Then, the area (A) of (triangle BCD) is:     [     A = sqrt{s(s - BC)(s - CD)(s - BD)} = sqrt{25(25 - 17)(25 - 16)(25 - 17)} = sqrt{25 cdot 8 cdot 9 cdot 8} = sqrt{14400} = 120     ]4.

Therefore, option A is correctly described by the relationship and does not contradict the given data.- For option B: The relationship between v and t is stated as v = 50 - 2t.

The minimum distance from the origin to a point on the circle is the difference between the distance from the origin to the center and the radius of the circle:   [   d_{text{min}} = 2 - 1 = 1   ]   Therefore, the minimum value of (x^2 + y^2) is:   [   m = d_{text{min}}^2 = 1^2 = 1   ]7.

Therefore:   [   d^3ab^3 = p^3(a + b)   ]2. Analyze the divisibility conditions:   - If (p mid d), then (a mid b) and (b mid a), which implies (a = b). This leads to no solution since (a) and (b) are coprime.   - Hence, (gcd(d, p) = 1).3. Consider the implications of (gcd(a, b) = 1):   - Since (a mid bp^3) and (b mid ap^3), and (gcd(a, b) = 1), it follows that (a) must divide (p^3) and (b) must divide (p^3).4. Possible values for (a) and (b):   - The divisors of (p^3) are (1, p, p^2, p^3). Given (gcd(a, b) = 1), the only possibilities are (a = 1) and (b = p) or (a = p) and (b = 1).5. Case 1: (a = 1) and (b = p):   - Substituting these values into the equation:     [     d^3 cdot 1 cdot p^3 = p^3(1 + p)     ]     Simplifying, we get:     [     d^3 = 1 + p     ]     Therefore, (d^3 - 1 = p). This implies (d^3 - 1) must be a prime number.6. Check for integer solutions:   - For (d = 2):     [     2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7     ]     Here, (p = 7), which is a prime number. Thus, (d = 2) and (p = 7) is a valid solution.     - Therefore, (x = da = 2 cdot 1 = 2) and (y = db = 2 cdot 7 = 14).7. Case 2: (a = p) and (b = 1):   - Substituting these values into the equation:     [     d^3 cdot p cdot 1 = p^3(p + 1)     ]     Simplifying, we get:     [     d^3 = p^2(p + 1)     ]     This equation does not yield any integer solutions for (d) and (p).Thus, the only pair of positive integers ((x, y)) that satisfies the given condition is ((2, 14)).The final answer is (boxed{(2, 14)})."},{"problem":"Let A B C be a triangle and P a point inside the triangle such that the midpoints M_{B} and M_{A} of the circumcircles k_{B} and k_{A} of A C P and B C P lie outside the triangle ABC.

Since M_{A} C M_{B} P is a kite with the axis of symmetry M_{A} M_{B}, it follows that Varangle C M_{A} M_{B}=varphi=Varangle C B M_{B}. Therefore, B and (by a similar argument) also A lie on the circumcircle of M_{A} C M_{B}, in other words, the midpoints M_{A} and M_{B} lie on the circumcircle of triangle A B C.Thus, M_{A} and M_{B} are the south poles of the triangle vertices A and B, respectively, and P is the incenter of triangle A B C. Therefore, Varangle P B A=Varangle C B P=varphi and since P D | A B, it also follows that Varangle B P D=varphi.

First, we show that triangle A B C is isosceles. Indeed, this follows from the condition angle B M A=angle M B C+angle B A C and the property of the exterior angle: angle B M A=angle M B C+angle B C A. From these two equalities, we have angle B C A=angle B A C, and thus, triangle A B C is isosceles. Next, we take a point K on side A C that is symmetric to point M with respect to point O - the midpoint of A C. Then A K=M C and therefore from the relation A M=B M+M C it follows that point M lies between C and O and, hence, this relation gives K M=B M. Since triangle A B C is isosceles, point O coincides with the projection of point B onto the base A C, and therefore B M=B K. Thus, in triangle K B M all sides are equal, meaning it is equilateral and all its angles are 60^{circ}."},{"problem":"10.

Without loss of generality, let E be the lowest point. Translate the square A B C D so that B coincides with E (Figure 1.12(1)). At this time, the square A B C D still covers triangle E F G.(2) Let B coincide with E. Connect B D. Since angle F B G=60^{circ} > angle D B A=45^{circ}, F and G are not on the same side of B D.

To verify this, let the rays B F and B F^{prime} intersect C D at H and H^{prime}, respectively.

Substituting these values into a-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}b, we get:begin{align}a-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}b &= 2sin A - sqrt{2}sin B &= 2sin A - sqrt{2}sinleft(frac{3pi}{4}-Aright) &= 2sin A - sqrt{2}left(frac{sqrt{2}}{2}cos A + frac{sqrt{2}}{2}sin Aright) &= sin A - cos A &= sqrt{2}sinleft(A-frac{pi}{4}right).end{align}Since 0<A<frac{3}{4}pi, we have -frac{pi}{4}<A-frac{pi}{4}<frac{pi}{2}.

This shows us that the center of the circle is at the point (0, 3) and the radius is 5.Let d be the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to line l. Using the chord length formula, for a chord of length 8 on a circle with radius 5, we have 8 = 2sqrt{25 - d^2}. Squaring both sides gives us 64 = 4(25 - d^2), which simplifies to d^2 = 4(25 - 16) = 36. Therefore, the distance d is 3.Now, there are two cases to consider:1. When line l is vertical (and hence has an undefined slope), the equation must be of the form x = k. Given that it passes through A(-3,0), it must be x = -3. This line satisfies the condition that the chord MN has length 8 since it is a diameter of the circle (because the distance from the center to this vertical line is equal to the radius, and twice the radius is the diameter).2. When line l has a defined slope, we must have that the distance from the center to the line is the shortest distance, which is perpendicular to the line. Thus, for the distance to be 3, and knowing that the center of the circle is (0,3), the line has to go through both the center and point A. Since point A is on the x-axis, the line must be horizontal and have the equation y = 0, which is the x-axis itself.Combining both cases, the possible equations for line l are either x = -3 or y = 0.Thus the solution is:[boxed{x = -3 text{ or } y = 0}]"},{"problem":"3.

We need to determine the possible values of (gcd(2^m - 2^n, 2^{m^2+mn+n^2} - 1)).2. Without loss of generality, assume ( m geq n ). We can use the property of gcd for powers of 2:   [   gcd(2^a - 1, 2^b - 1) = 2^{gcd(a, b)} - 1   ]   Applying this property, we get:   [   gcd(2^m - 2^n, 2^{m^2+mn+n^2} - 1) = gcd(2^{m-n} - 1, 2^{m^2+mn+n^2} - 1)   ]3.

Coloring the Grid:   - Color the 202 times 202 grid in a chessboard pattern, where each cell is either black or white, and adjacent cells have different colors.   - A T-tetromino covers 3 cells of one color and 1 cell of the other color. Therefore, to tile the entire grid, we need an equal number of T-tetrominoes that cover 3 black and 1 white cells and those that cover 3 white and 1 black cells.2. Counting the Cells:   - The total number of cells in the 202 times 202 grid is 202 times 202 = 40804.   - Since each T-tetromino covers 4 cells, the number of T-tetrominoes needed to cover the grid is frac{40804}{4} = 10201.   - However, 10201 is an odd number, which means we cannot have an equal number of T-tetrominoes of each type (3 black, 1 white and 3 white, 1 black). Therefore, it is impossible to tile the entire 202 times 202 grid with T-tetrominoes without removing some cells.3. Removing Cells:   - To make the grid tileable by T-tetrominoes, we need to remove cells such that the remaining number of cells is divisible by 4.   - Since 40804 is already divisible by 4, we need to remove at least 4 cells to make the grid tileable.4. Choosing Cells to Remove:   - Number the columns and rows from 0 to 201.   - Remove the cells at positions (200,0), (0,200), (201,200), and (201,201).   - After removing these 4 cells, the grid is divided into a 200 times 200 grid and two strips of width 2 along the top and right edges, with some cells removed.5. Tiling the 200 times 200 Grid:   - A 200 times 200 grid can be tiled completely by T-tetrominoes because 200 times 200 = 40000, which is divisible by 4.6. Tiling the Strips:   - Define L_k as a structure obtained by deleting the upper rightmost cell and bottom leftmost cell from a 4k+1 times 2 board.   - The rightmost part of the grid can be covered by L_{50}, and the uppermost part can also be covered by L_{50}.   - It is easy to see that L_k structures can be covered by T-tetrominoes.Conclusion:By removing 4 specific cells, the 202 times 202 grid can be tiled using T-tetrominoes.The final answer is boxed{4}."},{"problem":"From the vertex  A of the equilateral triangle  ABC a line is drown that intercepts the segment  [BC] in the point  E.

By (1) and symmetry, it is easy to see:begin{aligned}R_{1} R_{2} R_{3} & =S^{prime}{ }_{1} S^{prime}{ }_{2} S^{prime}{ }_{3}=S_{1} S_{2} S_{3}=Q^{prime}{ }_{1} Q^{prime}{ }_{2} Q^{prime}{ }_{3} & =Q_{1} Q_{2} Q_{3}=R^{prime}{ }_{1} R^{prime}{ }_{2} R^{prime}{ }_{3} .end{aligned}Let P be any point inside the hexagon Omega, and draw a line l parallel B C intersecting the sides R^{prime} Q and R S^{prime} of Omega at M and N respectively (the case of intersecting Q Q^{prime} and S^{prime} S is similar). Since M N is bisected perpendicularly by the altitude of B C, according to (3), we have P_{1} P_{2} P_{3} geqslant M_{1} M_{2} M_{3}=N_{1} N_{2} N_{3}. Since N is a point on the line segment R S^{prime}, and R S^{prime} is bisected perpendicularly by the altitude of A C, according to (3), we have N_{1} N_{2} N_{3} geqslant R_{1} R_{2} R_{3}.therefore quad P_{1} P_{2} P_{3} geqslant R_{1} R_{2} R_{3}. Noting (4), we know that when P varies inside the hexagon Omega (including the sides), the minimum value is taken at the six vertices, but triangle R Q S is contained within the hexagon Omega, and its vertices R, Q, and S are exactly three vertices of the hexagon Omega, so when P varies inside triangle R Q S, P_{1} P_{2} P_{3} takes its minimum value at the three vertices R, Q, and S.

The standard equation of the hyperbola could be either (frac{x^{2}}{144} - frac{y^{2}}{25} = 1) or (frac{y^{2}}{144} - frac{x^{2}}{25} = 1).However, condition (2) specifies that the foci are on the y-axis. Therefore, the hyperbola's standard equation should be in the form of (frac{y^{2}}{a^{2}} - frac{x^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1).The equations of the asymptotes are given by (y=± frac{a}{b}x). According to the problem, (frac{a}{b} = frac{1}{3}), which implies (b = 3a).The focal distance is given by (2c = 8), so (c = 4). We know that (c^2 = a^2 + b^2), and since (b = 3a), we can substitute this into the equation to get (c^2 = a^2 + (3a)^2). Solving this equation gives (a^2 = frac{8}{5}) and (b^2 = frac{72}{5}).Therefore, the standard equation of the hyperbola is (boxed{frac{y^{2}}{frac{8}{5}} - frac{x^{2}}{frac{72}{5}} = 1})."},{"problem":"Given a set of sample data with 8 numbers, the average is 8, and the variance is 12.

What is the minimum value of the variance of the new sample data?A: 10B: 10.6C: 12.6D: 13.6","solution":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:1. Sum of Original Numbers: Given that the average of the original 8 numbers is 8, we can calculate the total sum of these numbers as 8 times 8 = 64.2. Sum of All Numbers After Adding x and y: With the addition of two numbers, x and y, the new average becomes 9 for the 10 numbers. Thus, the total sum of the new set is 9 times 10 = 90.3. Finding the Sum of x and y: From the information above, we can deduce that x + y = 90 - 64 = 26.4. Original Variance Calculation: The variance of the original set is given as 12. Since variance is calculated as frac{1}{n}sum_{i=1}^{n}{{(a_{i}-mu)}^{2}} where mu is the mean, we have frac{1}{8}sum_{i=1}^{8}{{(a_{i}-8)}^{2}} = 12. Multiplying both sides by 8, we get sum_{i=1}^{8}{{(a_{i}-8)}^{2}} = 96.5. Variance of the New Sample Data: The variance of the new sample data with 10 numbers and a new average of 9 is calculated as frac{1}{10}[sum_{i=1}^{8}{{(a_{i}-9)}^{2}} + {(x-9)}^{2} + {(y-9)}^{2}]. This can be rewritten using the original sum of squares as frac{1}{10}[sum_{i=1}^{8}{{(a_{i}-8)}^{2}} - 2sum_{i=1}^{8}{(a_{i}-8)} + 8 + {(x-9)}^{2} + {(y-9)}^{2}] = frac{1}{10}({x}^{2} + {y}^{2} - 202).6. Minimum Variance Calculation: To find the minimum variance, we use the inequality sqrt{frac{{x}^{2} + {y}^{2}}{2}} geq frac{x + y}{2} = 13, which implies {x}^{2} + {y}^{2} geq 2 times 13^2 = 338. Therefore, the minimum value for {x}^{2} + {y}^{2} - 202 is 338 - 202 = 136.7.

From the condition, it follows that the terms of the arithmetic sequence are natural numbers and the common difference, denoted by d, is positive. Let the letters A, B, C, D, E represent digits or numbers, and the corresponding two-digit numbers will be denoted by overline{mathrm{A}} and so on.Since overline{Phi mathrm{A}}-overline{mathrm{A}}=(10 Phi+mathrm{A})-(10 mathrm{~A}+Phi)=9(Phi-mathrm{A})=2 d, the value of d is a multiple of 9. Therefore, d is either 9 or 18. The value 27 or more cannot be taken by d, because in this case overline{text { ФА }}= D +4 d geq 4 times 27>100, which is impossible since the number overline{text { ФА }} is a two-digit number.First, assume that d=9. Then mathrm{E}=1, mathrm{~A}=2, mathrm{C}=3, Phi=4. Using the values of the found letters, we see that the record on the board becomes D, 1 overline{mathrm{E}}, 24,33,42. Then 1 overline{mathrm{E}}=24-d=24-9=15 and D =1 overline{mathrm{E}}-d=15-9=6. Thus, the numbers on the board are 6,15,24,33 and 42.Now assume that d=18. Since overline{text { ФА }}= D +4 d=Д+4 times 18=Д+72, then 81 geq overline{Phi А} geq 72, i.e., the letter Ф represents either 7 or 8. Consider both possibilities.If the letter Ф corresponds to 7, then the record on the board has the form D, overline{text { ЕЕ, }}, overline{mathrm{A}} 7, overline{mathrm{CC}}, 7 overline{mathrm{A}}. Since overline{mathrm{CC}}= overline{mathrm{A}} 7+d=overline{mathrm{A}} 7+18, the number overline{mathrm{CC}} ends in 5 and the record on the board becomes D, overline{text { ЕЕ }}, overline{mathrm{A}} 7,55,7 overline{mathrm{A}}. Then 7 overline{mathrm{A}}=55+18=73, overline{mathrm{A}} 7=55-18=37, overline{mathrm{BE}}=55-2 d=55-36=19 and D =55-3 d= 55-54=1. Thus, the letters D and B represent the digit 1, which contradicts the condition of the problem.If the letter Ф represents 8, then the record on the board has the form D, overline{text { ЕЕ }}, overline{mathrm{A}} 8, overline{mathrm{CC}}, 8 overline{mathrm{A}}. Since overline{mathrm{CC}}=overline{mathrm{A}} 8+ d=overline{mathrm{A}} 8+18, the number overline{mathrm{CC}} ends in 6 and the record on the board becomes D, overline{text { БЕ }}, overline{mathrm{A}} 8,66,8 overline{mathrm{A}}.

Let n be the smallest number written by Petya, and n+q and n+p, 0 leq q<p leq 7- be the numbers erased by Vasya. Then the sum of the remaining numbers is frac{(n+(n+7)) 8}{2}-(n+q)-(n+p)=6 n+ 28-(q+p)=2022. From this, 6 n=2022-28+(q+p)=1994+(q+p)=6 times 332+(2+q+ p). The value of n is minimal when the right-hand side is minimal and must be a multiple of 6. Since the numbers q and p are non-negative, the right-hand side is minimal when q+p=4. Then 6 n=6 times 333, i.e., n=333.Problem 4 Answer: proof.Solution. There are infinitely many such triples. For example, for any natural number n the triple left(n^{2023} ; 0 ; n^{2022}right) is an integer solution.

According to the problem, the length of the segment [B ; M] is frac{2}{3} of the length of the segment [B ; C]. Additionally, triangles D A K and B M K are similar with a similarity ratio of frac{2}{3}. Therefore, the length of the segment [B ; K] is frac{2}{5} of the length of the segment [B ; D]. Thus, for the areas of triangles B C D and B M K, the relation S_{B M K}=frac{2}{3} times frac{2}{5} times S_{B D C}=frac{4}{15} times frac{1}{2}=frac{4}{30} holds, and the area of the quadrilateral C M K D is S_{C M K D}=frac{1}{2}- frac{4}{30}=frac{11}{30}.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_7222f67593c2cda60ca3g-2.jpg?height=357&width=716&top_left_y=2346&top_left_x=747)"},{"problem":"7.

Lemma: For every positive integer ( n geq 2 ), there are positive integers ( a ) and ( b ) with ( a + b = n ) for which there are nonnegative integers ( c ) and ( d ) such that ( 2ab = c^2 + d^2 ).   Proof: From Lagrange's Four Square Theorem, we know that any positive integer ( n ) can be expressed as the sum of four squares, i.e., there exist nonnegative integers ( x, y, z, t ) such that ( n = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + t^2 ).   - If ( n ) is not a perfect square, at least two of ( x, y, z, t ) are positive. Assume ( x, y > 0 ). Let ( a = x^2 + z^2 ) and ( b = y^2 + t^2 ). Then we can consider ( c = |xy - zt + xt + yz| ) and ( d = |xy - zt - xt - yz| ).

Since AB is parallel to the x-axis, the y-coordinate (ordinate) of point B must also be 2 to maintain the parallelism. This means that point B has the form (x_B, 2).2. The distance from point B to the y-axis is given as 3. The y-axis corresponds to x=0, so the distance from B to the y-axis is the absolute value of the x-coordinate of B.

To find the length of the line segment AB, we calculate the distance between the x-coordinates of A and B, since their y-coordinates are the same.

According to the properties of parallelograms, if both pairs of opposite sides in a quadrilateral are equal, the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to determine the positive integers ( n ) such that any triangle ( triangle ABC ) can be decomposed into ( n ) subtriangles, each similar to ( triangle ABC ).2. Initial Consideration:   Let's consider a triangle ( triangle ABC ) with side length 1. For a number ( n ) to be decomposable, we need to find a way to divide ( triangle ABC ) into ( n ) smaller triangles, each similar to ( triangle ABC ).3. Basic Decomposition:   - For ( n = 1 ), the triangle is itself, so it is trivially decomposable.   - For ( n = 2 ), it is not possible to decompose a triangle into 2 smaller triangles that are similar to the original triangle.4. Decomposition for ( n = 4 ):   - We can decompose ( triangle ABC ) into 4 smaller triangles, each similar to ( triangle ABC ). This can be done by drawing lines parallel to the sides of ( triangle ABC ) at one-third of the height from each vertex, creating 4 smaller triangles.5. Generalizing the Decomposition:   - From ( n = 4 ), we can generate more decomposable numbers by subdividing one of the smaller triangles into 4 even smaller triangles. This gives us ( n = 4, 7, 10, 13, ldots ) (i.e., ( n = 4 + 3k ) for ( k geq 0 )).   - Similarly, starting from ( n = 6 ), we can generate ( n = 6, 9, 12, 15, ldots ) (i.e., ( n = 6 + 3k ) for ( k geq 0 )).   - Starting from ( n = 8 ), we get ( n = 8, 11, 14, 17, ldots ) (i.e., ( n = 8 + 3k ) for ( k geq 0 )).6. Non-decomposable Numbers:   - The only missing values are ( n = 2, 3, 5 ). It is easy to see that these numbers are not feasible because there is no way to decompose a triangle into 2, 3, or 5 smaller triangles that are similar to the original triangle.Conclusion:The positive integers that are decomposable numbers for every triangle are those of the form ( n = 1 ) or ( n = 3k + 1 ) for ( k geq 1 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 1 } ) or ( n = 3k + 1 ) for ( k geq 1 )."},{"problem":"6.1.

Assume (abc = 1):   Without loss of generality, we can assume that (abc = 1). This assumption simplifies the problem without loss of generality because we can always scale (a), (b), and (c) to satisfy this condition.2. Substitute (a), (b), and (c) with (x), (y), and (z):   Let (x = a^3), (y = b^3), and (z = c^3). Then, since (abc = 1), we have (xyz = 1). Also, since (a^2 > bc), we have (x > 1).3. Rewrite the inequality:   The given inequality ((a^2 - bc)^2 > k(b^2 - ca)(c^2 - ab)) can be rewritten in terms of (x), (y), and (z) as:   [   left(frac{x - 1}{x}right)^2 > k left(frac{y - 1}{y}right) left(frac{z - 1}{z}right)   ]4. Simplify the inequality:   Since (xyz = 1), we can rewrite the inequality as:   [   frac{(x - 1)^2}{x} > k (y - 1)(z - 1)   ]5. Consider the case ((y - 1)(z - 1) leq 0):   If ((y - 1)(z - 1) leq 0), the inequality is trivially true because the left-hand side is positive and the right-hand side is non-positive.6. Consider the case ((y - 1)(z - 1) > 0):   If ((y - 1)(z - 1) > 0), then both (y > 1) and (z > 1). We need to find the minimum value of (frac{(x - 1)^2}{x(y - 1)(z - 1)}).7. Simplify further:   Since (xyz = 1), we have (z = frac{1}{xy}). Substitute (z) into the inequality:   [   frac{(x - 1)^2}{x(y - 1)left(frac{1}{xy} - 1right)} = frac{(x - 1)^2}{x(y - 1)left(frac{1 - xy}{xy}right)} = frac{(x - 1)^2}{x(y - 1)left(frac{1 - xy}{xy}right)} = frac{(x - 1)^2 cdot xy}{x(y - 1)(1 - xy)}   ]8.

Find the minimum value:   To find the minimum value, we need to analyze the behavior of the function. Notice that as (x to 1), the expression (frac{(x - 1)^2}{x}) approaches 0. However, for (x > 1), the expression (frac{(x - 1)^2}{x}) increases. The minimum value of (frac{(x - 1)^2}{x}) for (x > 1) is achieved when (x = 2), giving us:   [   frac{(2 - 1)^2}{2} = frac{1}{2}   ]10.

Find the sum of all the digits (in  base ten) of the product (10^n-1)m.","solution":"1. Let ( m ) be a positive integer with ( d ) digits in base ten. This means ( m ) can be written as ( m = overline{a_1a_2 ldots a_d} ), where ( a_i ) are the digits of ( m ).2. We need to find the sum of all the digits of the product ( (10^n - 1)m ), where ( d leq n ).3. First, consider the expression ( 10^n - 1 ). This is a number consisting of ( n ) digits, all of which are 9. For example, if ( n = 3 ), then ( 10^3 - 1 = 999 ).4. Now, multiply ( m ) by ( 10^n - 1 ):   [   (10^n - 1)m = (10^n - 1) cdot m   ]5. Expanding the product, we get:   [   (10^n - 1)m = 10^n cdot m - m   ]6. Let ( m = overline{a_1a_2 ldots a_d} ). Then:   [   10^n cdot m = overline{a_1a_2 ldots a_d} cdot 10^n   ]   This shifts the digits of ( m ) to the left by ( n ) places, adding ( n ) zeros at the end.7. Subtracting ( m ) from this, we get:   [   (10^n cdot m) - m = overline{a_1a_2 ldots a_d} cdot 10^n - overline{a_1a_2 ldots a_d}   ]8. This can be written as:   [   overline{a_1a_2 ldots a_d000 ldots 0} - overline{a_1a_2 ldots a_d}   ]9. When we perform this subtraction, the result is a number where each digit of ( m ) is subtracted from 9, and there are ( n - d ) nines in the middle. For example, if ( m = 123 ) and ( n = 5 ), then:   [   (10^5 - 1) cdot 123 = 99999 cdot 123 = 12300000 - 123 = 12299877   ]10. The sum of the digits of this result can be broken down into three parts:    - The sum of the digits of ( m ) subtracted from 9.    - The ( n - d ) nines in the middle.    - The sum of the digits of ( m ).11. For each digit ( a_i ) of ( m ), the corresponding digit in ( 999 ldots 9 - m ) is ( 9 - a_i ). Therefore, the sum of these digits is:    [    sum_{i=1}^d (9 - a_i)    ]12. The ( n - d ) nines in the middle contribute:    [    9(n - d)    ]13. Adding these together, we get the total sum of the digits:    [    sum_{i=1}^d (9 - a_i) + 9(n - d) + sum_{i=1}^d a_i    ]14. Simplifying, we get:    [    9d - sum_{i=1}^d a_i + 9(n - d) + sum_{i=1}^d a_i = 9d - sum_{i=1}^d a_i + 9n - 9d + sum_{i=1}^d a_i = 9n    ]15. Therefore, the sum of all the digits of the product ( (10^n - 1)m ) is ( 9n ).(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ 9n } )"},{"problem":"Which of the following descriptions of an algorithm is correct?

This sphere touches the edge EC at point F. The other sphere - the external tangent sphere - also touches the base edges at their midpoints, and the side edges at their extensions, for example, EC at point H. According to the equality of tangent segments from a point outside a sphere, CF = CG = frac{a}{2} and CG = CH = frac{a}{2} (where G is the point of tangency of the spheres on edge BC, and a is the edge length of the pyramid). Thus, EF = EC - FC = a - frac{a}{2} = frac{a}{2}, and EH = frac{3a}{2}. In the central similarity centered at E, EF : EH = 1 : 3. Therefore, the ratio of the volumes of the spheres is 1 : 27.Remarks: 1. The apex E of the pyramid is the center of a central similarity. The two edge-tangent spheres can also be derived by taking a \\"small\\" sphere that touches the edges emanating from E, and whose center is inside the pyramid. We enlarge this sphere from E until it touches the base edges, and then continue enlarging until this happens again.2. Let the center of the square ABCD be O_1. It is easy to see that the triangle EO_1C is isosceles and right-angled. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector plane of segment EC intersects the pyramid's height EO_1 at O_1. Thus, the radius of the internal tangent sphere is O_1F = frac{a}{2}, and the radius of the other sphere is frac{3a}{2}.3. Reflecting our pyramid over its base, we obtain a regular octahedron. From this, it is evident that the center of the smaller sphere lies within the base square.Galambos István (Zalaegerszeg, Zrínyi M. Gym., III. grade)Kálmán Tamás (Fazekas M. Fóv. Gyak.

It is known that the lengths of the tangent segments ES and ET are s-a and s, respectively. Since the central similarity centered at E maps these circles onto each other, the ratio of the radii of these circles, and thus the radii of the spheres, is:frac{s-a}{s} = frac{frac{3}{2}a - a}{frac{3}{2}a} = frac{1}{3}Thus, the ratio of the volumes is 1: 27.Remark: Some solvers noted that the ratio of the radii of the two spheres is 1:3 for any regular pyramid with equal edge lengths.

Let his father have a_{1} sons, his grandfather a_{2}, and so on up to the founder of the lineage, who had a_{n}. Then the share of this person is frac{1}{a_{1} a_{2} ldots a_{n}}, and we know that a_{1}+a_{2}+ldots+a_{n} does not exceed 149 (since the founder of the lineage is definitely not included in this sum).Thus, we are looking for a set of numbers with a sum not exceeding 149 and the maximum product. We will prove that any set, except for the set consisting of 49 threes and one two, does not have the maximum product, as it can be increased.First, if the sum of the numbers in the set is less than 149, add another number to make it equal to 149. The product will not decrease.Second, suppose there is a number a geqslant 4 in our set. Replace a with a pair of numbers b and c greater than one, such that b+c=a. We will prove that b c geqslant b+c. Indeed, b c-b-c=(b-1)(c-1)-1, which is non-negative for b and c greater than one.Third, if there is a number 1 in the set, then we can replace any number a and 1 with a+1, thereby increasing the product of these numbers by 1.Thus, any set can be transformed into a set of twos and threes without decreasing the product of its numbers.Furthermore, if there are at least three twos, their product is 8. If we replace three twos with two threes, the sum of the numbers remains the same, but the product becomes 9, which is again increased. Thus, we can ensure that the number of twos is no more than two.Since 149=49 cdot 3+2, the final set will have exactly one two.Therefore, any set of natural numbers with a sum not exceeding 149 can be transformed into a set of 49 threes and one two, and the product of the numbers in the set will not decrease.

The divisibility of x by 11 is equivalent to n being an odd multiple of 5, that is, x=6^{5m}+1 for some odd m. From here, using the formula for the sum of a geometric progression,x=p cdot q, quad text{where } p=6^{m}+1, q=1-6^{m}+6^{2m}-6^{3m}+6^{4m}Note that p and q are coprime. Indeed, let the number r divide both p and q. Then5=q-(6^{m}+1)-(6^{2m}-1)-(6^{3m}+1)-(6^{4m}-1)The expressions in parentheses on the right-hand side are divisible by p and, therefore, by r. Thus, r is a divisor of 5. But the remainder of the division of p by 5 is 2 for any m. Therefore, p is not divisible by 5, which means r=1.Since the number m is odd, one of the prime divisors of p is 7. We will prove that p is a power of 7 only when m=1. Suppose m geqslant 3 and 6^{m}+1=7^{s}. Then the number 7^{s}-1 is divisible by 2^{m} and, therefore, by 8. This implies that s is even, that is, s=2k. Therefore, 2^{m} cdot 3^{m}=(7^{k}-1)(7^{k}+1). Since 7^{k}+1 is not divisible by 3, the number 7^{k}-1 is divisible by 3^{m} and, therefore, 7^{k}-1 geqslant 3^{m}. But then7^{k}+1 leqslant 2^{m} cdot 11) p is divisible by 11. If p is not a power of 7, we can apply the same reasoning to p as to x. In both cases, p is the product of 7 and two coprime factors that are not powers of 7. Therefore, x has at least four different prime divisors, which is impossible.2) q is divisible by 11. Note that p is divisible by 7 and is not a power of 7, and q is coprime with p. Then q must be a power of 11. The remainder of the division of 6^{m} by 7 is -1 due to the oddness of m. Therefore, the number q gives a remainder of 5 when divided by 8.

Find all values of n for which such a decomposition is possible.","solution":"1. We start with the polynomial ( 1976(x + x^2 + cdots + x^n) ) and decompose it into a sum of polynomials of the form ( a_1x + a_2x^2 + cdots + a_nx^n ), where ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) are distinct positive integers not greater than ( n ).2. Let ( 1976(x + x^2 + cdots + x^n) ) be decomposed into the sum of ( t ) polynomials ( P_i ), i.e.,    [   1976(x + x^2 + cdots + x^n) = sum_{i=1}^t P_i(x),   ]   where ( P_k(x) = sum_{i=1}^n a_{k,i} x^i ).3. Since ( a_{k,i} ) are ( n ) distinct positive integers, the set ( {a_{k,1}, a_{k,2}, ldots, a_{k,n}} ) is a permutation of the set ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ). Hence,   [   a_{k,1} + a_{k,2} + cdots + a_{k,n} = frac{n(n+1)}{2}.   ]4. Since this is true for any ( k ), we have:   [   sum_{j=1}^t sum_{i=1}^n a_{j,i} = sum_{i=1}^t P_i(1) = frac{tn(n+1)}{2}.   ]   Therefore,   [   1976n = frac{tn(n+1)}{2}.   ]5. Simplifying the above equation, we get:   [   2 cdot 1976 = t(n+1).   ]   Hence,   [   n+1 mid 2 cdot 1976 = 2^4 cdot 13 cdot 19.   ]6. We now consider the possible values of ( n+1 ) that divide ( 2^4 cdot 13 cdot 19 ). These values are ( 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 13, 19, 26, 38, 52, 76, 104, 152, 247, 304, 494, 988, 1976 ).7. We need to ensure that ( t = frac{2 cdot 1976}{n+1} ) is an integer and that ( t ) is even. This implies ( v_2(n+1) ge 3 ).8. We now check the values of ( n+1 ) that satisfy ( v_2(n+1) ge 3 ):   - ( n+1 = 8 ) (i.e., ( n = 7 ))   - ( n+1 = 16 ) (i.e., ( n = 15 ))   - ( n+1 = 104 ) (i.e., ( n = 103 ))   - ( n+1 = 304 ) (i.e., ( n = 303 ))   - ( n+1 = 1976 ) (i.e., ( n = 1975 ))9. For each of these values, we verify that ( t = frac{2 cdot 1976}{n+1} ) is even:   - For ( n = 7 ), ( t = frac{2 cdot 1976}{8} = 494 ) (even)   - For ( n = 15 ), ( t = frac{2 cdot 1976}{16} = 247 ) (odd, discard)   - For ( n = 103 ), ( t = frac{2 cdot 1976}{104} = 38 ) (even)   - For ( n = 303 ), ( t = frac{2 cdot 1976}{304} = 13 ) (odd, discard)   - For ( n = 1975 ), ( t = frac{2 cdot 1976}{1976} = 2 ) (even)10.

This indicates that the graph of the function opens downwards. To find the axis of symmetry, we use the midpoint formula between the symmetric points x = -1 and x = 3:text{Axis of symmetry} = frac{-1 + 3}{2} = 1Therefore, the graph opens downwards and has an axis of symmetry at x = 1.boxed{text{downwards, line } x = 1}# Part 2: Range of Positive RootsGiven the symmetry of the quadratic function and the fact that y = 21 at x = 0 and decreases to y = 9 at x = 3, we can infer that the vertex of the parabola is to the left of x = 3. Since the parabola opens downwards and has its vertex to the left of x = 3, the positive root must be to the right of x = 3. Given the symmetry and the nature of quadratic functions, the positive root lies in the range:3  21, we look for the values of x where y exceeds 21. From the given values, we see that y = 21 at x = 0. Due to the symmetry of the parabola and its downward opening, y will be greater than 21 between the vertex and the points where y = 21. Since the axis of symmetry is at x = 1, and considering the symmetry of the parabola, the values of x for which y > 21 are between 0 and 2:0 < x < 2boxed{0 < x < 2}"},{"problem":"7.

Find all natural numbers n such that the number n^{2}+77 n is a perfect square of a natural number.","solution":"Answer: 4, 99, 175, 1444.Solution. FIRST METHOD. Let n(n+77)=m^{2}, where m, n are natural numbers. Consider 4 cases:- gcd(n, 77)=1. In this case, the numbers n and n+77 are coprime, and thus each of them is a perfect square: n=p^{2}, n+77=q^{2}. Hence, q^{2}-p^{2}=77, i.e., either q-p=1, q+p=77, or q-p=7, q+p=11. In the first case, we get q=39, p=38, n=1444, in the second case q=9, p=2, n=4.- gcd(n, 77)=7, i.e., n=7s, where s does not divide 11. Then 49s(s+11)=m^{2}. Since the numbers s and s+11 are coprime, each of them is a perfect square: s=p^{2}, s+11=q^{2}. Hence, q^{2}-p^{2}=11, i.e., q-p=1, q+p=11, q=6, p=5, s=25, n=175.- gcd(n, 77)=11, i.e., n=11s, where s does not divide 7. Then 121s(s+7)=m^{2}. Since the numbers s and s+7 are coprime, each of them is a perfect square: s=p^{2}, s+7=q^{2}. Hence, q^{2}-p^{2}=7, i.e., q-p=1, q+p=7, q=4, p=3, s=9, n=99.- gcd(n, 77)=77, i.e., n=77s. Then 77^{2}s(s+1)=m^{2}. Since the numbers s and s+1 are coprime, each of them is a perfect square: s=p^{2}, s+1=q^{2}. Hence, q^{2}-p^{2}=(q-p)(q+p)=1, which means p=0, i.e., s=n=0. Contradiction, since by condition n is a natural number.SECOND METHOD. Let n(n+77)=m^{2}, where m, n are natural numbers. Multiplying both sides by 4 and completing the left side to a perfect square, we getbegin{gathered}4 n^{2}+4 cdot n cdot 77+77^{2}=4 m^{2}+77^{2} (2 n+77)^{2}=4 m^{2}+77^{2} (2 n+77-m)(2 n+77+m)=77^{2}end{gathered}Let 2 n+77-m=a, 2 n+77+m=b.

Find all monic polynomials fin mathbb{Z}[X], of degree n, such that f(a) divides f(2a^k) for ain mathbb{Z} with f(a)neq 0.","solution":"1. Expressing the given condition in polynomial form:   We start with the condition that ( f(a) ) divides ( f(2a^k) ) for all ( a in mathbb{Z} ) such that ( f(a) neq 0 ). This can be written as:   [   f(2a^k) = g(a) f(a)   ]   for some polynomial ( g(a) in mathbb{Z}[X] ).2. Considering the polynomial division:   Let ( f(2a^k) = g(a) f(a) + h(a) ) where the degree of ( h(a) ) is less than the degree of ( f(a) ), or ( h(a) ) is the zero polynomial. Since ( f(a) ) divides ( f(2a^k) ), we have:   [   f(a) mid h(a)   ]   for all ( a in mathbb{Z} ) such that ( f(a) neq 0 ).3. Analyzing the polynomial ( h(a) ):   If ( h(a) ) is not the zero polynomial, then the degree of ( h(a) ) is less than the degree of ( f(a) ). For sufficiently large ( a ), both ( f(a) ) and ( h(a) ) are non-zero, and ( |f(a)| > |h(a)| ). This implies that ( f(a) mid h(a) ) does not hold, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, ( h(a) ) must be the zero polynomial.4. Simplifying the equation:   Since ( h(a) ) is the zero polynomial, we have:   [   f(2a^k) = g(a) f(a)   ]   This implies that if ( alpha ) is a root of ( f ), then ( 2alpha^k ) is also a root of ( f ).5. Considering the sequence of roots:   Define the sequence ( x_1 = alpha ) and ( x_{m+1} = 2(x_m)^k ) for all positive integers ( m ). Clearly, ( x_1, x_2, ldots ) are all roots of ( f ).6. Analyzing the magnitude of ( alpha ):   - Case 1: ( |alpha| = 0 ). Then ( alpha = 0 ).   - Case 2: ( |alpha| > 0.5^{frac{1}{k-1}} ). Then ( |x_1| < |x_2| < cdots ), so ( x_i ) are pairwise distinct, implying that ( f ) has infinitely many roots. Thus, ( f ) must be the zero polynomial, which is a contradiction since ( f ) is monic.   - Case 3: ( |alpha| < 0.5^{frac{1}{k-1}} ). Then ( |x_1| > |x_2| > cdots ), so ( x_i ) are pairwise distinct, implying that ( f ) has infinitely many roots. Thus, ( f ) must be the zero polynomial, which is a contradiction since ( f ) is monic.   - Case 4: ( |alpha| = 0.5^{frac{1}{k-1}} ). This case is potentially possible.7. Summarizing the cases:   Summing up, ( alpha = 0 ) or ( |alpha| = 0.5^{frac{1}{k-1}} ). If ( f ) has at least one root ( alpha ) such that ( |alpha| = 0.5^{frac{1}{k-1}} ), the modulus of the coefficient of the power, that is the lowest power with a nonzero coefficient, must be a positive integer multiple of ( 0.5^{frac{1}{k-1}} ).

(We can always switch the variable names to make these true.)We factor the equation as 2^{a}left(1+2^{b-a}right)=2^{c}left(1+2^{d-c}right), and then divide both sides by 2^{a} to obtain 1+2^{b-a}=2^{c-a}left(1+2^{d-c}right).We show that c=a by contradiction:If c neq a, then c geq a gives c>a.If c>a, then c-a>0, so c-a geq 1, since c-a is an integer.Therefore, the right side has a factor of 2^{c-a}, so the right side is even.Thus, the left side is even too, which means that 2^{b-a} must be an odd integer.For 2^{b-a} to be an odd integer, we must have 2^{b-a}=1 and so b-a=0 or b=a.In this case, the left side equals 2 and the right side is greater than 2 , since 2^{c-a} geq 2 and 1+2^{d-c}>1. This is a contradiction.Therefore, c=a.Since a=c, then 2^{a}+2^{b}=2^{c}+2^{d} becomes 2^{b}=2^{d} and so b=d.Therefore, if 2^{a}+2^{b}=2^{c}+2^{d} with a, b, c, d integers, then either a=b=c=d or a=c and b=d (with a neq b ) or a=d and b=c (with a neq b ).We examine these three possibilities in the given equation, noting that m, n and k are all positive integers:- Case 1: 4 m^{2}=m^{2}-n^{2}+4=k+4=3 m^{2}+n^{2}+kFrom the last equality, we obtain 3 m^{2}+n^{2}=4.Since m, n are positive integers, then m^{2} geq 1 and n^{2} geq 1.Since 3 m^{2}+n^{2}=4, then it must be that m=n=1.Thus, 4 m^{2}=k+4 implies 4=k+4 or k=0.But k>0, so this case is not possible.- Case 2: 4 m^{2}=k+4 and m^{2}-n^{2}+4=3 m^{2}+n^{2}+k and 4 m^{2} neq m^{2}-n^{2}+4From the second equality, we obtain 2 m^{2}+2 n^{2}+k=4, which is not possible since m, n, k>0, and so 2 m^{2}+2 n^{2}+k geq 5.Therefore, this case is not possible.- Case 3: 4 m^{2}=3 m^{2}+n^{2}+k and m^{2}-n^{2}+4=k+4 and 4 m^{2} neq m^{2}-n^{2}+4The first equality rearranges to m^{2}-n^{2}=k.The second equality also rearranges to m^{2}-n^{2}=k.The last statement is equivalent to 3 m^{2}+n^{2} neq 4. As we saw in Case 1 , this means that (m, n) cannot be the pair (1,1), which is consistent with m^{2}-n^{2}=k and k>0.Therefore, having examined all of the cases, we have reduced the original problem to finding the number of odd integers k between 0 and 100 for which the equation m^{2}-n^{2}=k has exactly two pairs of positive integers (m, n) that are solutions.Step 2: Connecting solutions to m^{2}-n^{2}=k with factorizations of kWe can factor the left side of this equation to give (m+n)(m-n)=k.Since m, n and k are positive integers, then m+n>0 and k>0 so m-n>0, or m>n.Since k is odd and each of m+n and m-n is an integer, then each of m+n and m-n is odd (since if either was even, then their product would be even).Also, we note that m+n>m-n since n>0.Suppose that (m, n) is a solution of the equation m^{2}-n^{2}=k with m+n=a and m-n=b for some odd positive integers a and b with a>b.Then a b=k, so a b is a factorization of k.Therefore, the solution (m, n) corresponds to a specific factorization of k.Now suppose that we start with a factorization k=A B where A and B are odd positive integers with A geq B.If we try setting m+n=A and m-n=B, then we can add these equations to give 2 m=A+B (or m=frac{1}{2}(A+B) ) and subtract them to give 2 n=A-B (or n=frac{1}{2}(A-B) ). Note that since n>0, then A>B.Therefore, every factorization of k as the product of two odd positive integers A and B with A>B gives a solution to the equation m^{2}-n^{2}=k.Since each solution gives a factorization and each factorization gives a solution, then the number of solutions equals the number of factorizations.Therefore, we have reduced the original problem to finding the number of odd integers k between 0 and 100 which have exactly two factorizations as the product of distinct odd integers a and b with a>b.Step 3: Counting the values of kSince k is odd, then all of its prime factors are odd.Since k11^{2}=121, which is larger than 100 .Therefore, p can only be 3,5 or 7 .If p=3, there are 9 possible values for q (primes from 5 to 31 ).If p=5, there are 5 possible values for q (primes from 7 to 19).If p=7, there are 2 possible values for q (11 and 13).Thus, there are 9+5+2=16 values of k of this form that work.If k=p^{r} q^{s} with r and s positive integers and at least one of r or s is larger than 1 , then k will have at least three factorizations. (For example, if r>1, then k=1 cdot p^{r} q^{s}=p cdot p^{r-1} q^{s}=p^{r} cdot q^{s} and all of these are distinct.)If k=p or k=p^{2} with p an odd prime, then k has only one factorization as the product of distinct factors left(1 cdot pright. and 1 cdot p^{2}, respectively). Thus, k cannot be of this form.If k=p^{3} with p an odd prime, then the divisors of k are 1, p, p^{2}, p^{3}, so it has exactly two factorizations of the desired type (namely 1 cdot p^{3} and p cdot p^{2} ).Since k100 ).Thus, there is 1 value of k of this form that works.If k=p^{4} with p an odd prime, then the divisors of k are 1, p, p^{2}, p^{3}, p^{4}, so it has exactly two factorizations of the desired type (namely 1 cdot p^{4} and p cdot p^{3} ). In this case, k has a third factorization, but it is of the wrong type since the two factors will be equal.Since k100 ).Thus, there is 1 value of k of this form that works.If k has more than 4 factors of p, then k will have at least three factorizations of the desired type, so k cannot be of this form. (In particular, if k=p^{n} and n>4, then k=1 cdot p^{n}= p cdot p^{n-1}=p^{2} cdot p^{n-2} and these are all distinct since n-2>2.)Having examined all of the possible forms, we see that there are 16+1+1=18 values of k that work, and so there are 18 positive integer solutions to the original equation."},{"problem":"Read the following two materials and solve the problem.

Restate the problem and notation:   Let ( G ) be a graph with ( n = 2014 ) vertices that does not contain any 3-cliques (triangles). The set of degrees of the vertices of ( G ) is ( {1, 2, ldots, k} ). We need to find the greatest possible value of ( k ).2. Initial claim and reasoning:   We claim that the maximum value of ( k ) is ( leftlfloor frac{2 cdot 2014}{3} rightrfloor = 1342 ). To justify this, consider a vertex with degree ( k ). All its neighbors must have degrees less than or equal to ( n - k ) because no two of them are connected (as ( G ) has no 3-cliques).3. Degree constraints:   The neighbors of a vertex with degree ( k ) can have at most ( n - k ) different degrees. The remaining ( n - 1 - k ) vertices can have at most ( n - k - 1 ) different degrees. Therefore, the total number of different degrees must satisfy:   [   1 + (n - k) + (n - k - 1) geq k   ]   Simplifying this inequality:   [   1 + n - k + n - k - 1 geq k   ]   [   2n - 2k geq k   ]   [   2n geq 3k   ]   [   k leq frac{2n}{3}   ]   Since ( k ) must be an integer, we take the floor function:   [   k leq leftlfloor frac{2n}{3} rightrfloor   ]   Substituting ( n = 2014 ):   [   k leq leftlfloor frac{2 cdot 2014}{3} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{4028}{3} rightrfloor = 1342   ]4. Constructing an example:   To show that ( k = 1342 ) is achievable, we construct a graph with ( 3t + 1 ) vertices where ( t = 671 ). This graph will have degrees ( {1, 2, ldots, 2t} ).   - Take a vertex ( X ) and connect it to ( 2t ) vertices ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2t} ).   - Take another set of ( t ) vertices ( B_1, ldots, B_t ).   - Connect ( A_i ) to vertices ( B_1, ldots, B_{i-1} ) for all ( i = 2, 3, ldots, t ). This ensures that vertices ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_t ) have degrees ( 1, 2, ldots, t ) respectively.   - Currently, vertices ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_t ) have degrees ( t-1, t-2, ldots, 0 ) respectively. Connect each ( B_i ) to all vertices ( A_{t+1}, A_{t+2}, ldots, A_{2t} ) so that their degrees become ( 2t-1, 2t-2, ldots, t ).   This construction ensures that the graph has degrees ( {1, 2, ldots, 2t} ) and no 3-cliques.The final answer is ( boxed{1342} )"},{"problem":"5.

How many full sequences are there for each n?","solution":"n! Solution Given a full sequence A for n, there are n+1 positions to insert another integer. Call i the position immediately after the ith integer of A, and 0 the front position. Let [A, i] be the sequence by inserting k in position i, where k is the largest integer m in A if position i occurs before the first occurrence of m, or m+1 if it is after. For example, if A is 2312, then [A, 0] is 32312 and [A, 2] is 23412. Let *A* be the sequence length n-1 obtained by deleting the first occurrence of m in A. For example, *2312* = 212. We claim that for any full sequence A of length n: (1) [A, i] is full for i = 0, 1, ... , n; (2) for given A, all of [A, 0], [A, 1], ... , [A, n] are distinct; (3) *A* is full; (4) *[A, i]* = A; (5) if *A* is obtained by removing the jth element of A, then [*A*, j-1] = A. (1) is immediate from the definition. For (2), consider [A, i] and [A, j] with i < j. If i and j are both before the first occurrence of m, then m occurs earlier in [A, i] than in [A, j], so they are distinct. If i occurs before the first occurrence and j after, then [A, j] includes m+1 and [A, i] does not. If both occur after, then each has just one occurrence of m+1, but in different places. (3) is immediate from the definition. For (4) note that if we [A, i] is obtained from A by inserting k, then the insertion is always the first occurrence of k. If k = m+1, then it is the only occurrence. If k = m, then by definition it is the first occurrence. Note also that the inserted k is always the largest integer in [A, i] (although maybe not its only occurrence). It follows that *[A, i]* = A. It is clear that the jth element of A corresponds to an element inserted into position j-1 in *A*. Now suppose m was the element removed in obtaining *A* from A. If m occurs in *A*, then it must occur after position j-1, because we removed the first occurrence of m. Thus the digit inserted in moving from *A* to [*A*, j-1] is m and we recover A. If m does not occur in *A*, then the largest digit in *A* must be m-1 and it must occur before position j-1, since A was full. Hence the digit inserted in moving from *A* to [*A*, j- 1] is again m and we again recover A. It now follows immediately that the number of full sequences length n must be n times the number of full sequences length n-1. (Note that if A and B are distinct full sequences legth n-1, then [A, i] and [B, j] must be distinct since *[A, i]* and *[B, j]* are distinct.). There is obviously just one full sequence length 1 (namely 1).

All of them differ by a shift. We will call the points, or positions, on two such segments corresponding if they coincide when one segment is shifted to the other.Assume that no marked number divides another.Consider the segment [1,1999]. By the condition, it contains a marked number, say x_{1}. Shift this segment by x_{1}. At the position corresponding to the number x_{1}, there cannot be a marked number (since it is divisible by x_{1}), but there is some other marked number x_{2} in this segment. Shift the new segment by x_{1} x_{2}. Then at the positions corresponding to the marked numbers x_{1} and x_{2}, there cannot be marked numbers (since these numbers are divisible by x_{1} and x_{2}, respectively), but there is some marked number x_{3} in this segment.Shift the new segment by x_{1} x_{2} x_{3}, find a new number x_{4}, and so on.

Let this tiger be A, its neighbors be tiger B and monkey C. Then on the other side of B sits a monkey, and on the other side of C - a tiger.

Let M be the intersection of AQ and DP, and N be the intersection of PC and QB.3. We need to find the length of MN in terms of AB and CD.First, we note that triangle AMP sim triangle QMD and triangle BNP sim triangle QNC by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. This is because:- angle AMP = angle QMD (corresponding angles since AB parallel CD)- angle MAP = angle QDM (corresponding angles since AB parallel CD)Similarly, for triangle BNP sim triangle QNC:- angle BNP = angle QNC (corresponding angles since AB parallel CD)- angle BPN = angle QCN (corresponding angles since AB parallel CD)4. From the similarity of triangles, we have:[frac{PM}{MD} = frac{AP}{DQ} = frac{PB}{QC} = frac{PN}{NC}]5. This implies that overleftrightarrow{MN} parallel overleftrightarrow{CD} because the ratios of the corresponding segments are equal.6. To find the length of MN, we use the fact that MN is a segment parallel to CD and divides the trapezoid ABCD proportionally. Therefore:[MN = frac{PM}{PD} cdot CD]7. Since frac{PM}{MD} = frac{AP}{DQ}, we can write:[frac{PM}{PD} = frac{AP}{AP + DQ}]8. Given frac{AP}{PB} = frac{DQ}{CQ}, let AP = k cdot PB and DQ = k cdot CQ for some constant k. Then:[AP = k cdot PB quad text{and} quad DQ = k cdot CQ]9. Since AB = AP + PB and CD = DQ + CQ, we have:[AP = frac{k}{1+k} cdot AB quad text{and} quad DQ = frac{k}{1+k} cdot CD]10. Substituting these into the expression for MN:[MN = frac{AP}{AP + DQ} cdot CD = frac{frac{k}{1+k} cdot AB}{frac{k}{1+k} cdot AB + frac{k}{1+k} cdot CD} cdot CD]11. Simplifying the expression:[MN = frac{frac{k}{1+k} cdot AB}{frac{k}{1+k} cdot (AB + CD)} cdot CD = frac{AB}{AB + CD} cdot CD]12.

Plugging that into the equation gives us:x^2 + y^2 = 16left(frac{x}{sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}right)^2.By cross-multiplying to clear the denominator:x^2 + y^2 = 16frac{x^2}{x^2 + y^2},Multiplying both sides by x^2 + y^2:(x^2 + y^2)^2 = 16x^2,Expanding the left side gives:x^4 + 2x^2y^2 + y^4 = 16x^2.Moving everything to one side to prepare for completing the square:x^4 - 14x^2 + 2x^2y^2 + y^4 = 0.Now let's write x^2 as (x+0)^2 - 2x(0) + 0^2, so we can complete the square:(x+0)^2 - 2x(0) + 0^2 + 2x^2y^2 + y^4 = 16x^2.Completing the square for x:[(x+0)^2 + y^2]^2 = 16x^2.This simplifies to:(x^2 + y^2)^2 = 16x^2.Taking the square root of both sides we get:x^2 + y^2 = pm4x.Since we are looking for the center of the circle, which is the same in both Cartesian and polar coordinates, we can now readjust our equation to find the x-component of the center of the circle. We know that x = rhocostheta, so we can take x out of the expression:x^2 + y^2 = 4x.We can rewrite this expression in standard circle form by completing the square:(x^2 + 4x + 4) + y^2 = 4x + 4,which simplifies to:(x + 2)^2 + y^2 = 4.This represents a circle centered at (-2,0) with radius 2. The point (-2, 0) in Cartesian coordinates needs to be converted back to polar coordinates.For the point (-2, 0), the radius rho = sqrt{(-2)^2 + 0^2} = 2, and the angle theta is pi radians (or 180 degrees, which corresponds to the negative x-axis in polar coordinates).Therefore, the polar coordinates of the center of the circle are boxed{(2,pi)}."},{"problem":"[ Trilinear coordinates ]a) Find the trilinear coordinates of the vertices of the Brocard triangle.b) Find the trilinear coordinates of the Steiner point (see problem underline{19.55 .2) .}#","solution":"a) From the solution of problem 19.55, it follows that the vertex A_{1} of the Brocard triangle is the intersection point of the lines C P and B Q, where P and Q are the first and second Brocard points.

Therefore, this statement is incorrect because 5 is indeed a monomial.- Statement B: 3x+2y is a monomialA monomial is defined as an expression with a single term. The expression 3x+2y consists of two terms, 3x and 2y, which means it is not a monomial but a binomial, a type of polynomial. Thus, this statement is incorrect because 3x+2y is not a monomial.- Statement C: The coefficient of x^{2}y is 0The coefficient of a term is the numerical part of the term that multiplies the variable(s). In the absence of a specific context where x^{2}y is part of an expression with a stated coefficient of 0, the default coefficient for any term not explicitly multiplied by a number is 1.

Ensure (k_n) are integers:   - For (k_n) to be integers, (frac{q^n - 1}{d}) must be an integer for all (n).   - This implies that (d) must divide (q^n - 1) for all (n).8. Consider the divisibility condition:   - Since (d) must divide (q^n - 1) for all (n), (d) must be a divisor of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the set ({q^n - 1 : n in mathbb{N}}).9. Analyze the gcd condition:   - The gcd of ({q^n - 1 : n in mathbb{N}}) is (q - 1).   - Therefore, (d) must be a divisor of (q - 1).10. Conclude the possible values of (q):    - Since (d) must be a positive integer, (q - 1) must be a multiple of (d).    - This implies that (q) can be any positive integer greater than 1.The final answer is (boxed{q in mathbb{N}, q > 1})."},{"problem":"Let x,y and z be positive real numbers such that xy+z^2=8.

To approach this problem, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or apply inequalities such as the AM-GM inequality. Here, we will use the AM-GM inequality to find a lower bound.3.

This implies:   [   a mid 3a + 16b quad text{and} quad b mid 3a + 16b   ]   Since (a) and (b) are primes, we can deduce:   [   a mid 16b quad text{and} quad b mid 3a   ]   Given that (a) and (b) are distinct primes, the only possible values are:   [   a = 2 quad text{and} quad b = 3   ]   Let's verify:   [   A = 3(2)^2(3) + 16(2)(3)^2 = 3 cdot 4 cdot 3 + 16 cdot 2 cdot 9 = 36 + 288 = 324 = 18^2   ]   Thus, ((a, b) = (2, 3)) is a valid solution.Therefore, the pairs ((a, b)) that satisfy the condition are ((19, 19)) and ((2, 3)).The final answer is (boxed{(19, 19) text{ and } (2, 3)})."},{"problem":"1195.

Therefore, to compare the areas of different triangles, we can try to find a common base and compare the heights.First, note that the area of parallelogram (ABCD) is equal to twice the area of triangle (ABD) because triangles (ABD) and (CDB) are isometric. Therefore, we have (|ABD| = frac{1}{2}).We now want to compare the area of triangle (MND) with the area of triangle (ABD).Unfortunately, these two triangles do not have a common base. However, triangles (AND) and (ABD) share the side (AD). We draw the heights from vertices (N) and (B) in triangles (AND) and (ABD), respectively. Let (K) be the foot of the height from vertex (B) in triangle (ABD) and (J) be the foot of the height from vertex (N) in triangle (AND). We then have[frac{|AND|}{|ABD|} = frac{frac{1}{2} cdot AD cdot NJ}{frac{1}{2} cdot AD cdot BK} = frac{NJ}{BK}]Since the lines ((MI)) and ((BK)) are perpendicular to segment ([AD]), they are parallel. Quadrilateral (JNBK) is therefore a parallelogram with two right angles, making it a rectangle. Thus, (NJ = BK) and therefore[|AND| = |ABD| = frac{1}{2}]We apply the same method to compare the areas of triangles (AND) and (AMD). We introduce (J) as the foot of the height from vertex (N) and observe that[frac{|AMD|}{|AND|} = frac{|AMD|}{|ABD|} = frac{frac{1}{2} cdot AD cdot MI}{frac{1}{2} cdot AD cdot BK} = frac{MI}{BK}]The lines ((BK)) and ((MI)) are parallel, so by Thales' theorem for triangles (ABK) and (AMI), we find[frac{MI}{BK} = frac{MD}{DB} = frac{MD}{MB + MD} = frac{3MB}{MB + 3MB} = frac{3}{4}]Thus, (|AMD| = frac{3}{4} |ABD| = frac{3}{8}).We can then conclude that[|MND| = |AND| - |AMD| = frac{1}{2} - frac{3}{8} = frac{1}{8}]This allows us to conclude that the area of triangle (MND) is (frac{1}{8})."},{"problem":"Example 10 The sports meet lasted for n(n>1) consecutive days, and a total of m medals were awarded.

Constructing the polynomials ( p(x) ) and ( q(x) ):   - For ( a ) even, let ( a = 2r ) and ( d(x) = x^2 + 2rx + b ).   - Let ( f(x) = p(x + r) ) and ( g(x) = q(x + r) ).   - Then we have:     [     (p(x))^2 - (x^2 + k)(q(x))^2 = 1.     ]   - Let ( R(x) = p(x) - xq(x) ). Then:     [     R(x)(2xq(x) + R(x)) = 1 + k(q(x))^2.     ]5. Finding minimal solutions:   - If ( deg(p) = 2 ), then the only solution for ( q(x) ) in ( mathbb{Q}[x] ) is ( q(x) = frac{2}{k}x ) and ( p(x) = 1 + frac{2}{k}x^2 ).   - If ( k = -m^2 ) for some ( m in mathbb{Q}^+ ), then the minimal solution is ( p(x) = mx ) and ( q(x) = m ).6. General solution construction:   - For ( k neq -m^2 ), the minimal solution is:     [     p_n(x) = 2p_0p_{n-1}(x) - p_{n-2}(x), quad q_n(x) = 2p_0q_{n-1}(x) - q_{n-2}(x),     ]     where ( p_0 = 1 ), ( q_0 = 0 ), ( q_1(x) = frac{2}{k}x ), and ( p_1(x) = 1 + frac{2}{k}x^2 ).7. Conclusion:   - For ( k mid 2 ), the solution exists in ( mathbb{Z}[x] ).   - For ( k = -1 ), the solution is ( p(x) = x ) and ( q(x) = 1 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ d(x) = x^2 + ax + b } ) where ( b = frac{a^2 - 1}{4} ) if ( a ) is odd, and ( b = frac{a^2}{4} + k ) with ( k mid 2 ) if ( a ) is even."},{"problem":"Hao Yu wrote three letters and three envelopes, and he needs to put each letter into the corresponding envelope, with only one letter in each envelope.

We will use the divisibility rule for 4: a number is divisible by 4 if and only if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4.In an interesting number, the digits can be rearranged in any way, and the divisibility by 4 should remain unchanged. This implies that there are no odd digits in its representation (otherwise, any of them could be placed at the end, and the resulting number would not be divisible by 4).Let's consider which two non-zero even digits an interesting number can end with. As we remember, the two-digit number formed by these digits must be divisible by 4.- 24 - this option does not work, because when the last two digits are swapped, the number will end in 42, and 42 is not divisible by 4;- 28 - this option does not work, because when the last two digits are swapped, the number will end in 82, and 82 is not divisible by 4;- 44 - this option works;- 48 - this option works;- 64 - this option does not work, because when the last two digits are swapped, the number will end in 46, and 46 is not divisible by 4;- 68 - this option does not work, because when the last two digits are swapped, the number will end in 86, and 86 is not divisible by 4;- 84 - this option works;- 88 - this option works.From this, it follows that an interesting number can consist only of the digits 4 and 8.

We start by considering the problem statement: Are there positive integers (a, b) with (b ge 2) such that (2^a + 1) is divisible by (2^b - 1)?2. First, we check the case (b = 2). If (b = 2), then (2^b - 1 = 2^2 - 1 = 3). We need (2^a + 1) to be divisible by 3. Notice that (2^a equiv -1 pmod{3}) if (a) is odd. Therefore, for (b = 2), any odd (a) will work. 3. Now, let's assume (b > 2). The order of 2 modulo (2^b - 1) is (b). This means that the smallest positive integer (d) such that (2^d equiv 1 pmod{2^b - 1}) is (d = b).4. If (2^b - 1) divides (2^a + 1), then (2^a equiv -1 pmod{2^b - 1}). Squaring both sides, we get:   [   2^{2a} equiv 1 pmod{2^b - 1}   ]   This implies that the order of 2 modulo (2^b - 1) divides (2a). Since the order is (b), (b) must divide (2a).5. Since (b) divides (2a) but not (a), (b) must be even. Let (b = 2k). Then (2k) divides (2a), which implies (k) divides (a). Let (a = mk) where (m) is an odd integer.6. We need (2^a equiv -1 pmod{2^b - 1}). Substituting (a = mk), we get:   [   2^{mk} equiv -1 pmod{2^{2k} - 1}   ]   Since (m) is odd, we can simplify this to:   [   2^k equiv -1 pmod{2^{2k} - 1}   ]   This implies:   [   2^k + 1 geq 2^{2k} - 1   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   2^k + 1 geq 2^{2k} - 1 implies 2^k + 2 geq 2^{2k}   ]   For (k geq 2), (2^k + 2 < 2^{2k}).

Then, since the circles are constructed on the sides of the trapezoid AB, BC, and CD as diameters, the angles angle AOB, angle BOC, and angle COD are right angles. Therefore, points A, O, C lie on the same line and points B, O, D lie on the same line, meaning that O is the intersection point of the diagonals of the trapezoid.Let the midpoints of sides AB, BC, and CD be K, L, and M respectively. Since KL and LM are the midlines in triangles ABC and BCD, KL parallel AC and LM parallel BD. Thus, KL perp LM, meaning that triangle KLM is a right triangle. Moreover, KL = frac{AC}{2} = 9, and KM = frac{AD + BC}{2} = 15, so by the Pythagorean theorem, LM = 12. Therefore, BD = 2LM = 24.Instead of reasoning with midlines, we can consider triangles BOC and AOD, which are similar with a ratio of 10:20 = 1:2. Since AC = 18, then OC = frac{1}{3}AC = 6.

The divisor in (1) can be easily factored:mathrm{d}(x)=left(x^{4}+x^{3}+x^{2}right)+left(x^{2}+x+1right)=left(x^{2}+x+1right)left(x^{2}+1right)To simplify the division, we seek simple (i.e., with few terms) polynomials that are multiples of individual factors of mathrm{d}(x), and then those that are multiples of mathrm{d}(x) itself. According to known identities,begin{aligned}x^{3}-1 & =left(x^{2}+x+1right)(x-1), quad text { therefore } x^{6}-1 & =left(x^{3}-1right)left(x^{3}+1right)=left(x^{2}+x+1right)(x-1)left(x^{3}+1right) x^{6}+1 & =left(x^{2}+1right)left(x^{4}-x^{2}+1right), quad text { so } left(x^{6}-1right)left(x^{6}+1right) & =x^{12}-1=mathrm{d}(x) cdotleft(x^{4}-x^{2}+1right)left(x^{3}+1right)(x-1)end{aligned}Proceeding further, if j is a positive integer, x^{12 j}-1 is divisible by x^{12}-1, and thus also by mathrm{d}(x); in other words, the remainder of the division x^{12 j}: mathrm{d}(x) is 1.Now, 1001=83 cdot 12+5, sofrac{x^{1001}-1}{mathrm{~d}(x)}=frac{x^{83 cdot 12} cdot x^{5}-x^{5}+x^{5}-1}{mathrm{~d}(x)}=x^{5} cdot frac{x^{83 cdot 12}-1}{mathrm{~d}(x)}+frac{x^{5}-1}{mathrm{~d}(x)}The last expression's first term expands to a polynomial because the second factor in the numerator is divisible by the denominator according to the above (and because x^{5} is also a polynomial, and the product of two polynomials is a polynomial), so the sought remainder is identical to the remainder of the division left(x^{5}-1right): mathrm{d}(x). This division can also be avoided based on an observation:begin{gathered}x^{5}-1=(x-1)left(x^{4}+x^{3}+x^{2}+x+1right)=(x-1)left(mathrm{d}(x)-x^{2}right)= =mathrm{d}(x) cdot(x-1)+x^{2}(1-x)end{gathered}Here, x^{2}(1-x) is of lower degree than mathrm{d}(x), so this is the sought remainder.II. The divisor in (2) is mathrm{d}left(x^{2}right), which can be calculated from x^{2} in the same way that (1)'s divisor is calculated from x. Therefore, according to the above, for every positive integer j, left(x^{2}right)^{12 j}-1=x^{24 j}-1 is divisible by (2), and since 1001=41 cdot 24+17, the remainder of the second division is identical to the remainder of the division left(x^{17}-1right) : mathrm{d}left(x^{2}right).

The sum of all four numbers is1000 a+100(a+b)+10(a+b+c)+(a+b+c+d)=3838Since a, b, c, and d are digits, a+b+c+d leq 36. Since the units of the number 3838 are 8, a+b+c+d leq 28. Therefore, at most 2 is carried over to the tens in the calculation mathrm{k}. Since a+b+c+2 leq 29, at most 2 is carried over to the hundreds. Since a+b+2 leq 20 and the hundreds of the number 3838 are 3, at most 1 is carried over to the thousands. From this, it follows that a is equal to 2 or 3. The possibility a=2 is ruled out, because in this case 10 leq a+b=2+b leq 11, so at least 7 would have to be carried over to the hundreds, which is not possible. Therefore, a=3.Since at most 2 is carried over to the hundreds, b is equal to 3, 4, or 5. The possibility b=5 is ruled out, because in this case 8 leq 8+c=a+b+c leq 9, so at least 4 would have to be carried over to the tens, which is not possible. The possibility b=3 is also ruled out. In this case, 2 would have to be carried over to the hundreds. But since at most 2 is carried over to the tens, a+b+c+2=8+c<20 and therefore at most 1 would be carried over to the hundreds. Therefore, b=4.Since at most 2 is carried over to the tens, c is equal to 4, 5, or 6. The possibility c=6 is ruled out, because in this case 13+c=a+b+c+d leq 9, which is not true. If c=4, 2 would have to be carried over to the tens. In this case, we would have a+b+c+d=11+d, so d would have to be 9. But then the units of the sum of the numbers would be 0, which is a contradiction. Therefore, c=5 and thus d=6.Eva, Igor, Marko, and Maruša wrote the numbers 3456, 345, 34, and 3.Justification of how many digits the numbers have ..... 1 pointJustification that a=3 ..... 2 pointsJustification that b=4 ..... 2 pointsJustification that mathrm{c}=5 and mathrm{d}=6 ..... 1 pointWritten solution (all four numbers) ..... 1 point"},{"problem":"10.305.

Find all such triples of prime numbers p, q and r, that frac{p}{q}=frac{8}{r-1}+1.","solution":"Answer: (7,3,7); (5,3,13); (3,2,17).First solution. Rewrite the relation as8 q=(p-q)(r-1)If q=2, it becomes 16=(p-2)(r-1). Then p-2 is a power of two, so p=3 and r=17. If r=2, the relation (*) becomes 8 q=p-q, from which p=9 q, which is impossible. We will further assume that q and r are odd prime numbers. But then the prime number p is also odd, otherwise the left side of (*) is negative. Therefore, r-1 and p-q are even numbers, so p-q=2 and r-1=4 q or p-q=4 and r-1=2 q. If q=3, in the first case p=5 and r=13, and in the second case p=r=7. Thus, we can assume that q>3. Consider the first case. Since p and q are not divisible by 3 and p=q+2, q has the form 3 k+2, but then r=4 q+1=12 k+9, which is impossible. Consider the second case. Since p and q are not divisible by 3 and p=q+4, q has the form 3 k+1, but then r=2 q+1=6 k+3, which is also impossible.Second solution. From the condition, it follows that p>q. Multiply by the denominators and rewrite the relation as 7 q+p=(p-q) r. From this, in particular, we get that 7 q+p is divisible by p-q. Therefore, 8 q=(7 q+p)-(p-q) is also divisible by p-q. On the other hand, 8 p=(7 q+p)+7(p-q) is also divisible by p-q. Thus, p-q divides the greatest common divisor of the numbers 8 p and 8 q, but this divisor is 8. Therefore, only three cases are possible: p-q=1, p-q=2, p-q=4 and p-q=8. Note immediately that in the last three cases p geqslant q+2 geqslant 4 and, in particular, p is not divisible by three.The first case is possible only when p=3 and q=2, and then r=17, which is the first solution.In the second case, p-q=2 and then r=frac{1}{2}(7 q+p)=4 q+1=4 p-7. If r gives a remainder of 2 when divided by three, then p will be divisible by three, which is impossible.

If r gives a remainder of 2 when divided by three, then p will be divisible by three, which is impossible. If r gives a remainder of 1 when divided by three, then q will be divisible by three and, therefore, q=3, p=7 and r=7, which is the third solution.In the fourth case, p-q=8 and then r=frac{1}{8}(7 q+p)=q+1=p-7. If r gives a remainder of 2 when divided by three, then p will be divisible by three, which is impossible.

[30] Let M be a 2014 times 2014 invertible matrix, and let mathcal{F}(M) denote the set of matrices whose rows are a permutation of the rows of M. Find the number of matrices F in mathcal{F}(M) such that operatorname{det}(M+F) neq 0.","solution":"Answer: 2013!!^{2}Proof. Number the rows of M as r_{1}, r_{2}, ldots, r_{2014}, and remark that by invertibility, these rows are linearly independent. We can write operatorname{det}(M+F) as the sum of the determinants of the 2^{2014} matrices which can be obtained by replacing some set of the rows of M with the corresponding rows of F (this follows from distributivity and expansion by minors) - we'll call these the insertion matrices of M. Of course, the rows of F are themselves some permutation of the rows of F.Now, all insertion matrices in which some row appears at least twice have determinant 0 (by linear dependence of rows), so the determinant of M+F is the sum of the determinants of the insertion matrices whose rows are a permutation of the r_{i}. Let the i-th row of F be r_{sigma(i)} and partition sigma into disjoint cycles; we claim operatorname{det}(M+F)=0 iff sigma contains an even cycle.Indeed, if we replace row r_{i} in M, in order for the rows of M+F to remain a permutation of the r_{i} we must replace row r_{sigma(i)} as well, and so on. In other words, we either replace none of the rows in any particular cycle, or we replace all of them. Yet if any cycle is even, the determinants of any insertion matrix in which that cycle is replaced and the same insertion matrix, except not replacing that cycle, are the same in magnitude and opposite in sign (this follows from the fact that a row transposition flips the sign of the determinant, and we must perform an odd number of these). Thus operatorname{det}(M+F) vanishes if sigma contains any even cycles. On the other hand, if sigma consists of only odd cycles, every non-zero insertion matrix has determinant operatorname{det}(M) neq 0 by analogous reasoning (this time, the even number of row transpositions preserves sign). It remains only to count the number of elements of S_{2014} which can be decomposed into exclusively odd cycles.We begin by writing a recursion for the general problem. Let x_{n} denote the number of permutations on [n] which can be decomposed into exclusively odd cycles. By casework on the cycle containing 1 , we find the recursionx_{n}=sum_{i}binom{n-1}{2 i-2}(2 i-2)!x_{n-2 i+1}where x_{0}=x_{1}=x_{2}=1.The intended solution from this point was combinatorial in nature, similar to the one from the fourth comment under Evan Chen's \\"Recursion\\" blog post (from June 2012). The following much nicer finish is due to Lawrence Sun:Set y_{n}=x_{n} / n! and rewrite the recursion asn y_{n}=y_{n-1}+y_{n-3}+ldotsShifting, we find in addition that(n-2) y_{n-2}=y_{n-3}+ldotsSubtracting,n y_{n}=y_{n-1}+(n-2) y_{n-2}for all n. It now follows from a straightforward induction that y_{2 k}=[(2 k-1)!!]^{2} /(2 k) ! and y_{2 k+1}= [(2 k+1)!!(2 k-1)!!] /(2 k+1)!. In particular,x_{2014}=2014!y_{2014}=(2013!!)^{2}as desired.Here is an alternative approach: define the power series F(z) in the variable z byF(z)=sum_{n=0}^{infty} x_{n} frac{z^{n}}{n!}The recurrence relation is equivalent to the differential equationF^{prime}(z)=left(sum_{n=0}^{infty} z^{2 n}right) F(z)=frac{1}{1-z^{2}} F(z) .Solving this equation using the initial condition F(0)=1 givesF(z)=sqrt{frac{1+z}{1-z}}=(1+z)left(1-z^{2}right)^{-1 / 2} .By the binomial theorem, we haveF(z)=(1+z) sum_{n=0}^{infty}binom{-1 / 2}{n}(-1)^{n} z^{2 n},sox_{2014}=2014!binom{-1 / 2}{1007}(-1)^{1007}=(2013!!)^{2}as desired.Remark 0.6. This problem was proposed by Dhroova Aiylam.Remark 0.7. We can write the matrices F in mathcal{F}(M) as F=P M, where P ranges over all 2014 times 2014 permutation matrices. Then, we have F+M=left(P+1_{2014 times 2014}right) M, which is invertible if and only if P+1_{2014 times 2014} is. Using this, we can give an alternative proof that the answer to the question is equal to the number of permutations of {1, ldots, 2014} with cycles of odd length."},{"problem":"Given sets A={x|2{x}^{2}-5x＜0} and B={x|{3}^{x-1}≥sqrt{3}}, then Acap B=left(  right)A: (frac{3}{2}，frac{5}{2})B: (0，frac{3}{2})C: [frac{3}{2}，frac{5}{2})D: (0，frac{3}{2}]","solution":"To solve the problem, we need to find the intersection of sets A and B, which are defined by inequalities.

Identify the given information and set up the problem:   - ( AB ) is a diameter of the circle.   - ( C ) is a point on ( AB ) such that ( AC : CB = 6 : 7 ).   - ( D ) is a point on the circle such that ( DC perp AB ).   - ( DE ) is the diameter through ( D ).   - We need to find the ratio (frac{[ABD]}{[CDE]}).2. Determine the coordinates of points:   - Let the center of the circle be ( O ) and the radius be ( R ).   - Since ( AB ) is the diameter, ( A ) and ( B ) are at ((-R, 0)) and ((R, 0)) respectively.   - Let ( C ) be at ((x, 0)).

Calculate the ratio ( frac{[ABD]}{[CDE]} ):   - The area of ( triangle ABD ) is proportional to the length ( AB ), and the area of ( triangle CDE ) is proportional to the length ( CC' ).   - Since ( AB = 2R ) and ( CC' = frac{2R}{13} ), the ratio is:     [     frac{[ABD]}{[CDE]} = frac{AB}{CC'} = frac{2R}{frac{2R}{13}} = 13     ]The final answer is (boxed{13})."},{"problem":"If the function f(x) = x^3 (x in mathbb{R}), then the function y = f(-x) on its domain is ( )A: A monotonically decreasing even functionB: A monotonically decreasing odd functionC: A monotonically increasing even functionD: A monotonically increasing odd function","solution":"Since f(x) = x^3 (x in mathbb{R}), then the function y = f(-x) = -x^3 = -f(x) (x in mathbb{R}), we find that y = f(-x) is an odd function.

(This logic also applies to the topmost triangle if we notice that d_0 = 0.) However, we also know that the area of each shape is frac{1}{2450} times the area of triangle{ABC}. We then have frac{d_k^2-d_{k-1}^2}{75} = frac{1}{2450}. Simplifying, d_k^2-d_{k-1}^2 = frac{3}{98}. However, we know that d_0^2 = 0, so d_1^2 = frac{3}{98}, and in general, d_k^2 = frac{3k}{98} and d_k = frac{sqrt{frac{3k}{2}}}{7}. The smallest k that gives a rational d_k is 6, so d_k is rational if and only if k = 6n^2 for some integer n.The largest n such that 6n^2 is less than 2450 is 20, so k has boxed{020} possible values.Solution by zeroman"},{"problem":"If the two square roots of a positive number are 2a-1 and a-2, then the positive number is ______.","solution":"To find the positive number whose square roots are 2a-1 and a-2, we first recognize that these two expressions represent the same value, hence we can set them equal to each other:[2a - 1 = a - 2]Solving for a involves combining like terms:[2a - a = -2 + 1]This simplifies to:[a = -1]However, there seems to be a mistake in the initial solution provided. If 2a-1 and a-2 are both square roots of the same positive number, then squaring either expression should give us that positive number. The correct approach is to either square 2a-1 or a-2 and then solve for the positive number. Let's correct the approach:Given that 2a-1 and a-2 are square roots of the same positive number, we can square either of them to find the positive number. Let's square 2a-1:[(2a-1)^2 = 4a^2 - 4a + 1]If we mistakenly set 2a-1 equal to a-2 and solved for a, we should instead be looking for the positive number, which is the result of squaring either root. The correct approach to find the positive number directly was not clearly outlined in the initial solution. To correct and clarify, if a=1 as per the initial solution's process (which involves a mistake in the logic of combining the roots directly), and we substitute a=1 into either square root expression to find the positive number:[(2(1)-1)^2 = (2-1)^2 = 1^2 = 1]Thus, the positive number, correctly derived from the square of its root (and acknowledging the mistake in the initial solving process), is indeed 1. Therefore, the corrected and detailed step-by-step solution concludes:[boxed{1}]"},{"problem":"When a certain biased coin is flipped five times, the [probability](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Probability) of getting heads exactly once is not equal to 0 and is the same as that of getting heads exactly twice.

Based upon the problem, note that {5choose1}(h)^1(t)^4 = {5choose2}(h)^2(t)^3. After cancelling out terms, we end up with t = 2h. To find the probability getting 3 heads, we need to find {5choose3}dfrac{(h)^3(t)^2}{(h + t)^5} =10cdotdfrac{(h)^3(2h)^2}{(h + 2h)^5} (recall that h cannot be 0).
