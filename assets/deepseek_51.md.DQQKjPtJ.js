I usually prescribe my such patients inhaled salbutamol/levosalbutamol to be used on as-and-when-needed basis for asthma symptoms. If symptoms are frequent, he may need inhaled corticosteroids regularly.2. If he has nose symptoms like nose obstruction, sneezing, running nose, etc, I would also add levocetirizine + montelukast to above treatment.3. Regular steam inhalation will also help him for nose symptoms.4. In general, I would suggest him to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes, cold air and air pollution as much as possible.5. I would also suggest him allergy testing for common air-borne allergens such as house dust mites, pollens, molds, insect proteins, animal dander, etc. This will help him to identify the substances causing allergies to him and also to know the measures to avoid them.6. Regular physical exercise including breathing exercise as well as a healthy nutrition rich in vitamins & minerals would also help him in a long run by improving his lung capacity and immunity respectively.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to him.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your father the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

Yes, 196 IgE is high but it is not that high that you should worry too much.2. To derive conclusion, I would like to know whether you have any symptoms. If you do not have any symptoms and IgE was only a lab finding, you should not worry at all and I usually suggest my such patients repeat test after 6 months.3. If you have symptoms of allergies (allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, etc), I would suggest you allergy testing for specific allergens (allergy causing substances).Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello my daughter is in India doing prac work for her Uni degree.

I would like to know more about her like - a. since when she has allergies? b. since when has she asthma? c. what are her symptoms? d. since when is she taking predcort ds? e. has she taken any inhalers? f. what is frequency of her attacks? etc etcAbove details would help me to know about her problems better and therefore to make more specific suggestions for her.At present, I would like to make suggestions for her, from details provided by you, as follows:2. Predcort ds is an oral corticosteroid. It is not used as first treatment in children with asthma as many safer alternative drugs are available. Unless your daughter has very severe asthma and she does not respond to safer medicines, I would not suggest regular use of predcort ds for my such patients.Side effects that can occur with regular/frequent use of oral corticosteroids are numerous - weight gain, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, gastritis, suppressed immunity, mental disturbances, cataract, glaucoma, and others....2. I usually treat my children patients with asthma with regular use of inhaled corticosteroids and montelukast. Inhaled corticosteroids have much less side effects as compared to oral corticosteroids as they act more locally.3. I would also suggest her allergy testing for common air-borne allergens such as house dust mites, pollens, molds, insect proteins, animal dander, etc. This will help you to know identify the substances causing allergies to her as well as to know the measures to avoid them.4. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe her allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to gradually improve allergies on long term basis.5. In general, please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.6. Regular physical exercise (including breathing exercises) as well as healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals will also help her by improving her lung capacity as well as immunity on long term.7. As you have specifically asked about dose of predcort ds, I would suggest you that please consult her doctor before continuing predcort ds. Please give her oral steroids only if her doctor finds they are necessary for her.Also, if she is taking oral steroids for long time, it is not desirable to stop them abruptly, it may cause rebound symptoms. Hence please gradually reduce dose under her pediatrician's guidance.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to her.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your daughter a very good health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"My son, who has exercise induced asthma, has had a significant chronic dry cough for several weeks.

If he has nose symptoms, I would prescribe him levocetirizine + montelukast for 7-14 days, depending upon response.2. I would also suggest him regular warm saline gargles which will help early recovery of his throat.3. If he has difficulty in sleeping due to nose congestion, regular steam inhalation will also help in addition to above treatment.4. If he has coughing associated with wheezing/breathing difficulty, I suggest my such patients to use rescue inhalers such as salbutamol or levoalbutamol.5. For better management of asthma, spirometry with post-bronchodilator reversibility testing and post-exercise testing as well as allergy testing for common air-borne allergens are useful. Spirometry will help to know his lung capacity, whether he requires regular inhalers and what type of inhalers. Allergy testing will help to identify the substances causing allergies to him as well as whether he could be benefited from allergen specific immunotherapy.6. As you are living in a smoke free environment, it is very appropriate for children having asthma.7.

From your description, I would first think of urticaria (hives) & angioedema. However, please note that hives have itching. If you do not have itching, I would think of other conditions.2. I usually treat such patients with antihistamines like levocetirizine or cetirizine or hydroxyzine.3.

Please do not scratch the itchy lesions as scratching would aggravate itching.5.

More details about your nose and ear symptoms would have helped better.3. Dizziness could be some simple reasons, unrelated to allergies, such as nutrition deficiencies, low hemoglobin, stress, anxiety, inadequate hydration/water intake, etc etc. Depending upon cause, nutritional supplements (for nutrient deficiencies), iron-folic acid-vit B12 (for low hemoglobin), relaxation & meditation (for stress/anxiety), ensuring adequate liquids during day, etc would help.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi sir my son is now 5yrs old.

I want to know reason for his dizzinesss. Plz reply sir.","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your son's history and would like to make suggestions for him as follows:1. Regarding sweating and dizziness, there are numerous possible causes. Most common causes are simple like inadequate hydration, reduced blood sugar (usually due to reduced food intake, staying hungry for long time, etc), tiredness, severe/prolonged exercise, etc.I would like to know about duration of the episode as well as how it improved. If it was the first time such episode, I would suggest you not to worry too much. However, if such episode occurs again, I would suggest you to get him examined by a pediatrician who may also suggest some investigations to identify the cause.2. Regarding omnacortil, it is to be given for severe cases of wheezing/asthma but not for all wheezing episodes. This is because many safer drugs and inhalers (such as salbutamol or levosalbutamol) are available for wheezing and Omnacortil (Prednisolone) can have many side effects if used frequently.3. As he has allergies, I would suggest him allergy testing for common air-borne allergens such as house dust mites, pollens, molds, insect proteins, animal dander, etc. This will help you to identify the substances causing allergies to him as well as to know the measures to avoid them.4.

What should I do?","Doctor":"Hi,You haven't mentioned about allergy to Lysol in your question despite having asthma.If your are working in hospital and bother about Lysol allergy then I would suggest you better cover your mouth with facial mask while floor cleaning is being done.Here we assumed that you are having allergic to Lysol.See the best way to cure allergy is to avoid contact with that allergen despite having very good antiallergic drugs available in market."},{"Patient":"I had an ultrasound on Tuesday to check for an abdominal aortic aneurysm I ve been having pain in my mid upper abdomen ever since the test as if I pulled a muscle, I ve been really tired and having headaches too my dad died in 2010 with this condition.

She takes Metoprol Tartrate (50 mg.) Hydroxyurea (500 mg.) Folic Acid (1 mg.) and an aspirin. Can she take a Zertec or Zertec D? My email is YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your mother's history and would like to make suggestions for her as follows:1. There are so many types of allergies so I would like to know more about your mother's symptoms as well as details of the other medications as well as medical disorders. This will help me to make more specific suggestions.2. As you have asked about Zyrtec D (use for allergic rhinitis - nose allergies), I assume your mother has nose allergies - nose obstruction, running nose, sneezing etc. 3. Zyrtec (Cetirizine) usually does not interact with the mentioned medications. However, Zyrtec D contains a decongestant medicine which may not be desirable for heart patients. As your mother taking Metoprolol and aspirin, I assume she might be having some heart-related problem.So, Zyrtec would be safer for her rather than Zyrtec D.4. If your mother has kidney or liver problem, then Zyrtec can cause more side-effects. So in that case, necessity as well as dose of Zyrtec should be discussed with your doctor before taking it.5. Another option is to use local nose sprays. Intranasal antihistamine (Azelastine) as well as intranasal corticosteroid (Fluticasone propionate or mometasone) are available in market. They act more locally, on nose membrane. As very small portion of these spray enter blood, they usually do not interact with other medications. They have less generalized side effects also.6. If your mother has severe nose congestion, please get her nose examined by an ENT surgeon as long term aspirin use can cause nose polyps. Also, metoprolol can cause nose congestion in some patients. Please discuss this possibilities with your mother's physician who will review her history and complaints in detail and then decide accordingly.7. Please do not reduce/stop metoprolol and aspirin by yourself as it could be dangerous.8. I would also suggest your mother allergy testing for common air-borne allergens such as house dust mites, pollens, molds, insect proteins, animal dander, etc. This will help her to identify the substances causing allergies to her as well as to know the measures to avoid them.9. In general, I would suggest her to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.10. Regular breathing exercises and steam inhalation would also help her in a long run for nose symptoms.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to your mother.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your mother the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I have several freckled colored spots on my body.

I would like to know more details about you like - a. how long they last? b. do they respond to medications? c. do you have any allergies? d. do you have any other medical conditions? e. do you take any medicines on regular/frequent basis? f. do you have any digestive complaints? etc etcAbove information would help me to know your complaints better and therefore to make suggestions for you more specifically.2. At present, from your provided history, I would suggest you antihistamine like cetirizine or levocetirizine or hydroxyzine for symptom control.3. I would also suggest you to apply moisturizing lotion or cream over itchy areas as well as dry skin which would reduce itching.4. Please do not scratch the itchy areas as scratching would aggravate itching.5. For identification of cause, I usually suggest my patients investigations like complete blood counts, ESR, CRP, urine examination, stool examination, thyroid testing, allergy testing, serum total IgE, etc. However, detailed history and information is required before suggesting specific investigations.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"hello doctor my 4year old son has cough problem fro 1 year and alway doctor give him normal medicin and salbuta mol now i pressure on doctor for blood test and now they noticed my son has asthma problem ,,and now few hour ago i noticed that my son has left rib cage swelling i am worried about it please suggest me.","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.i went through your son's history and would like to make suggestions for your son as follows:1. First of all, I would like to mention here that childhood asthma is very different from adult asthma. Any blood test cannot diagnose or rule out asthma. Of course, blood tests can diagnose allergies, which may be one of the causes for asthma.2. Asthma is best diagnosed by spirometry with post-bronchodilator reversibility testing. However, usually children below 5-6 years find it very difficult to perform such test perfectly. Hence, diagnosis of asthma at 4 years of age remains more or less of a judgment of the doctor. Detailed history of all the symptoms since infancy as well as physical examination is required for proper diagnosis.3. Regarding left rib cage swelling, I would like to know its exact location, how it appeared, when appeared, whether painful, hard, soft, moving, etc details.4. If it is painful, I would first rule out rib fracture as your child has cough for last one year. An opinion from orthopedic surgeon and an X-ray will be helpful.5. If it is not painful, there are many possibilities. Hence I would suggest you to get him examined by his doctor and then decide further.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your child the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor.

I will usually resort to my inhaler and herbal cough syrup at home. After awhile it will go away. Please explain.","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. I would like to know more about you like your age, since when you have asthma, any nose/sinus symptoms, any allergies, previous investigations, which inhalers are you using, your habits, environment, etc.Above details would help me to know more about you and hence to make more specific suggestions.2. At present, from your provided history, I would suggest you that your cough bouts may be a sign of insufficient control of asthma. I usually suggest my such patients to increase their controlled medications like inhaled corticosteroids or addition of montelukast.3. I would suggest you spirometry with post-bronchodilator reversibility testing which measures lung capacity as well as helps your doctor to choose appropriate medications.4. I would also suggest you allergy testing for common air-borne allergens such as house dust mites, molds, pollens, insect proteins, animal dander, etc. This will help you to know the substances causing allergies to you as well as to know the measures to avoid them.5. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to gradually improve allergy symptoms.6. In general, please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.7. Regular physical exercises including breathing exercises as well as a healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals will also help you by improving your lung capacity as well as immunity respectively on a long run.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I have a serious allergic reaction after being bitten by what I assumed was a wasp while I slept.

Does she have any allergies? f. Does she have any other medical conditions? g. Does she take any medications frequently/regularly?Above details would help me to know your mother's complaints better and therefore to make more specific suggestions. At present, I would suggest her as follows, from your given information:2. I usually prescribe my such patients levocetirizine or cetirizine in morning and hydroxyzine in evening.3. I would also suggest her application of calamine lotion or moisturizing lotion/cream over the rashes and dry skin.4. I usually also suggest my such patients a good multivitamin-multimineral supplement containing especially vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin A, zinc, selenium & essential fatty acids, usually for 2-3 months, which may help improve both skin as well as immunity.5. To identification of the cause of such rashes, I usually suggest investigations like complete blood counts, ESR, CRP, thyroid testing, stool examination, urine examination, serum total IgE, allergy testing, serum ANA, etc. However, before choosing appropriate tests, detailed history of the patient is necessary.Hope above information will be helpful to your mother.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your mother the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I am 21 years old. I have recently been put on a nebulizer 3 times a day and a rescue inhaler and also a steroid inhaler. My throat is feeling very tight and I'm a getting very light headed. The dr said I have uncontroled cronic asthma like 3 months ago. I have gotten so bad sometimes that I have actually passed out. I am not feeling good at all right now and my husband is at work. Help?","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. If you are not feeling well at present, I would suggest you to use nebulizer and inhaler as instructed by your doctor. For example, rescue inhalers (those to be taken at time of emergency like levoalbutamol or salbutamol etc).If rescue inhalers/nebulizers do not improve your symptoms, I would suggest you to contact your doctor and get examined by him/her.2. As you have chronic uncotrolled asthma, regular use of steroid inhalers is very important for you. Please do not discontinue/decrease the dose without instructions by your doctor.3. I usually prescribe my such patients montelukast in addition to inhalers.4. I would suggest you allergy testing for common air-borne allergens such as house dust mites, molds, pollens, insect proteins, animal dander, etc. This will help you identify the substances causing allergies to you as well as to know the measures to avoid them.5. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to gradually improve allergy symptoms and hence gradually reduce medicine requirements.6. In general, I would suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.7. Regular breathing exercises and nutrition rich in minerals & vitamins will also help you in a long run by improving your lung capacity and immunity respectively.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"hi ,I get tested for allergy , and this is the result : 1.positive result for grass and mites . 2.positive result for orchard , blue and english rye types of grass, in addition to timothy type of grass.3. positive result for d.pteronyssinus and d.faraine which are both types of house dust mites.","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I would like to explain your allergy testing result as follows:1. It shows that you are allergic to pollens and house dust mites.2. Both pollens and house dust mites are air-borne allergens. They usualy cause allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis, occasionally urticaria/angioedema, etc.3. Practically, it is difficult to avoid them as they are air-borne. 4. If your medications are not controlling your symptoms enough or you tend to develop side effects due to medications, I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will know your symptoms, investigations and medications in detail and may consider allergen specific immunotherapy which gradually improves allergy symptoms over a long period.Hope above information will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I am 42 year old female, average weight and height, not obese, fit and active. I have recently been diagnosed asthmatic (approx 2/3 weeks ago) having had breathlessness for several months. I have been prescribed seretide (purple inhlaer) 25/125 twice a day as wall as ventolin (blue inhlaer) - I am finding I am needing the ventolin at least twice a day still.  For about 4/5 days now I have had pain in the topf of my chest around about breastbone which is persistent and feels like someone is standing on my chest.  I don't  have wheeziness but do still get a bit out of breath when rushing around. I take hayfever tables and have been told this is what has triggered the asthma. I am concerned about the chest pain as it is constant - I saw doctor last week and he just said I was anxious and nothing to worry about but it is getting me down now. Do I need to see another doctor or is it related to astham and will eventually go away? Any advice gratefully receievd...","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. If you need Ventolin (a rescue inhaler to be used on as-and-when-needed basis) twice a day, it suggests that your asthma is not well controlled with controlled medications (such as Seretide 25/125 twice a day).2. I usually prescribe my such patients additional montelukast on regular basis. Increasing dose of controller inhaler (Seretide) could be another possible option. I would suggest you to discuss this with your doctor and make a decision regarding how to improve asthma control.3. Regarding chest pain, yes, such type of chest pain can occur in uncontrolled asthma. However, \\"heaviness of chest\\" can also occur in heart problems, gastric/esophageal problems and anxiety disorders.Practically, if taking a rescue inhaler relieves your chest pain, it might be due to asthma. However, please remember that there are other possible causes also, which should be ruled out by your physician by detailed history, physical examination and appropriate investigations.4. I would also suggest you allergy testing for common air-borne allergens such as house dust mites, pollens, molds, insect proteins, animal dander, etc. This will help you identify the substances causing allergies to you as well as to know the measures to avoid them.5. In general, please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.6. Regular physical exercise including breathing exercises as well as nutrition rich in vitamins & minerals will also help you in a long run by improving your lung capacity and immunity respectively.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Is there anything to help alleviate severe symptoms associated with an allergic reaction to bactrim?

As she has cough along with headache, I would first like to know about her nose symptoms, whether she has running nose, nose congestion, mouth breathing, sneezing, etc. If any of above symptoms are present, I usually prescribe my such patients levocetirizine + montelukast for 7-14 days repending upon response. Regular steam inhalation will also help.2. Whooping cough with pneumonia is unusual presentation. So I would not first suspect whooping cough in her, unless she has been in contact with a patient with whooping cough.3. Viral infections can sometimes be prolonged, may be up to 4-6 weeks. Also, cough takes long time to respond to medications. So I would personally think of viral infection first.4. Regular warm saline gargles will help soothing throat and hence may help early recovery.5. Please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.6. Please have a nutritious diet with adequate warm fluids during days maintain hydration which may help early recovery.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to your daughter.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your daughter a quick recovery and the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I have constant itching and crawling skin all over my body, as well as burning eyes.

Most of the allopathic medications for asthma are very good at controlling symptoms of asthma but they usually do not \\"cure\\" asthma. However, as they are very effective in controlling symptoms, I would not suggest you to withhold medications without consulting your doctor. I usually suggest my such patients to continue medications until their asthma is improved/\\"cured\\".2. Asthma is a very complicated disease, related to multiple factors such as diet, physical exercise, lung capacity, immunity, allergies, stress, environment, genetics, heredity, etc. So depending upon these factors, it is very difficult to predict whether and when it will improve. There is no single therapy/treatment that can promise \\"cure\\". However, in practice, doctors (including myself) see many patients who improve/are cured over years and are no more asthmatic. So it is important to stay positive and make efforts towards improving health.3. All therapies - allopathy, ayurveda or homeopathy - act differently. So I always suggest my patients to consult expert in their own fields. So please consult a qualified Ayurveda Doctor and a qualified Homeopathy doctor to ask about their treatments.4. As an Allergist-Immunologist, I would suggest you allergy testing for common air-borne allergens like house dust mites, molds, pollens, insect proteins, pet dander, etc. This will help you identify the substances causing allergies to you as well as to know the measures to avoid them.5. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to gradually improve your allergy symptoms over a long period.6. In general, please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.7. Regular physical exercise including breathing exercises and light diet rich in vitamins & minerals will also help you in a long run by improving your lung capacity and immunity respectively.8. If stress is an important factor in your life, I would suggest you regular meditations and relaxation practices.To summarize, regular medications, allergen specific immunotherapy, life-style changes and support of complementary therapies - all are important to improve/cure asthma.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"This past week I have been experiencing periods of extreme weakness, shortness of breath, and tingling.

Do you have wheezing/breathing difficulties? b. Do you have any nose problems? c. What is the cause of sleep apnea? d. What is the cause of obesity? e. Do you smoke? f. Any allergies? g. Any other medical conditions/medications use?Above details would help me to understand your complaints better and therefore to make suggestions more specifically. However, at present, from your given history, I would suggest you as follows:1. As you already have chest/thorax scan as well as bronchoscopy which have not revealed any reason, I would think of possibility of asthma or upper respiratory cause like rhinitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis, etc. As you have sleep apnea, also it favors more of upper respiratory cause. However, detailed history is required before coming to a conclusion as well as to suggest tests.2. Once cause of your cough is found, appropriate medications can be suggested.3. In general, please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.4. Regular warm saline gargles and steam inhalation can also help in a long run.5. Weight reduction would help increase your lung capacity as well as reduce sleep apnea. Hence, would improve both upper respiratory as well as lung symptoms. Please seek a professional advice for exercise and diet.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"hello docter.... my baby girl of 1 year 9 months has been getting hives for the last 2 months... usually after she gets up in the morning n after a afternoon nap.. allergy testing done showed she is allergic to milk. so we have stopped it and giving her isomil. but still ni improvement. she requires to be given allerid once a day otherwise the patches increase. what to do? worried abt giving allerid on a long term basis.","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your daughter's history and would like to make suggestions for her as follows:1. I would like to know more about her milk allergy symptoms. How was milk allergy diagnosed? If she is really allergic to milk, taking any milk product (be it curd, buttermilk, butter, milk biscuits, milk chocolates, etc) can cause her allergic reactions.2. If she is not taking any milk products and still she develops allergic reactions, I would suggest allergy testing for other foods such as soy, ground nut, wheat, rice, egg, sea foods, tree nuts, etc. This will help you to identify the allergy, if any.3. Hives can occur even without allergies. Possible causes are viral infections, bacterial infections, parasites, drugs, etc.4. As she is getting hives since 2 months, I usually suggest my such patients investigations like serum total IgE, allergy testing for common allergens, complete blood counts, ESR, stool examination, urine examination, etc. However, before suggesting investigations, I always take a detailed history about her each and every symptom, diet, environment, drugs, etc etc. This may minimize requirement of investigations.5. For symptom management of hives, I usually suggest my patients cetirizine which causes less sedation as compared to chlorpheniramine maleate (Allerid).6. Please trim her nails regularly to make sure she does not scratch and damage the itchy skin as scratching would only aggravate itching. 7. Application of moisturizers or calamine lotion over her dry/itchy skin and rashes would also help.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to your daughter.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your daughter the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I’m having pain in my lower abdomen thought it might be kidney stones but the pain has persisted all day started a 6 this morning and the pain was pretty strong but then during the day had 2 bowel movements and the pain was reduced but not gone have eaten very little today an apple and half a sandwich and have been drinking water all day and some cranberry juice and the last vowel movement looked like there was mucus mixed with the stool so what’s going on here.","Doctor":"Hello, It could be many things and nothing.

It is important to mention here that characteristics of adult asthma and childhood asthma are often different. So it is very important to get him examined by a pediatrician/pediatric asthma specialist doctor who can decide whether he has asthma and whether he needs regular treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (Budesonide, i.e., Budecort).2. Although usually 9 years old children can use rotacaps effectively, some children may be more comfortable with metered dose inhaler. It is important to prescribe appropriate type of inhaler device for a child.3. So, of course, budesonide is a part of treatment of asthma in children, I would not suggest you to use it without prescription of a doctor.

Usually such red spots on roof of mouth are not related to allergies but sneezing could be.2. If you repeatedly tend to sneeze upon/following contact with a cat/kitten, it is possible that those symptoms are due to allergy to cat dander/proteins.3.

I usually suggest my such patients spirometry with post-bronchodilator reversibility testing which helps to measure lung capacity as well as to know the type of lung/airway disorder you may have.2. For diagnosis of allergies, I would suggest you allergy testing for common air-borne allergens such as house dust mites, molds, pollens, insect proteins, animal dander (if you have pet). This will help you identify the substances causing allergies as well as to know the measures to reduce their exposure.3. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to gradually improve allergy symptoms over a long duration.4. For symptom control, I usually prescribe my such patients salbutamol or levosalbutamol inhaler to be used on as-and-when-needed basis.

First of all, I would like to know more about all your symptoms since very beginning. i.e., nose symptoms, cough, wheezing, their frequency, day/night variations, seasonal variations, any skin symptoms, stomach symptoms, headache, whether you have dog, how dog allergy was diagnosed, etc.This will help me to understand your complaints better and also to make suggestions for you more specifically.2. As you have allergies and developed wheezing/breathing difficulty, with X-rays and other reports normal, I would first think of possibility of asthma.I usually suggest my such patients Spirometry with post-bronchodilator reversibility testing which helps to measure your lung capacity as well as type of your lung disorder, if any.3. I would also suggest you allergy testing for common air-borne allergens like house dust mites, molds. pollens, insect proteins, animal dander, etc. This will help you identify the cause of your allergies as well as to know the measures to avoid them.4. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to gradually improve your allergy symptoms.5. In general, I would suggest you to avoid exposure to cold air, dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.6. For control of symptoms, I would suggest you fexofenadine or ebastine or similar antihistamine (they cause relatively less sedation among other antihistamines) + montelukast.7. For wheezing, I would suggest you to use salbutamol or levosalbutamol inhaler on as-and-when-needed basis. However, spirometry testing will also help your doctor to choose more appropriate type of inhaler for you.8. I would like to know your height and body mass index as obesity/overweight could also contribute to your tiredness/sleepiness symptoms. For patients with body mass index more than 25, weight loss as low as 5-10% of the initial body weight can improve symptoms. In that case, I would suggest you to consult a professional dietitian and physical trainer.9. Regular physical exercise including breathing exercises and a healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals will also help you in a long run by improving your lung capacity and immunity respectively.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I always have a hive(s) on my face, jawline, or scalp.

If you have such episodes frequently, I would suggest you allergy testing for common air-borne allergens such as house dust mites, pollens, molds, insect proteins, animal dander, etc. If this is the first episode, I would suggest you not to think about allergy.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I have what I think is allergies. I have a symptom, however, that's quite alarming. My chest feels extremely tight, I'm often short of breath, and it hurts to take a deep breath. I have a sore throat and headache as well.

Dropped to lasix daily and BP up again 138/98 and having wet cough again and shortness of breath. WHy on lasix BID was i ok BP was normal no issues and now daily having symptoms again?","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. I would like to know about your symptoms, medications, tests, etc in great detail as the provided details are confusing.2. It is unusual to have CHF with BP 138/98 that needs daily Lasix unless there is some defect in heart function/structure. I would suggest you to get Echocardiography (Echo) and Electrocardiogram (ECG) done and get reviewed by an experienced cardiologist.3. Your cough and breathlessness could be due to asthma also. I would suggest you Chest X-ray and Spirometry with post-bronchodilator reversibility testing to know your lung capacity and identify the type of lung disorder you may have.4. If such investigations, especially those related to heart, are not done, it is difficult to conclude why are you getting regular symptoms, why you need daily Lasix, what is causing breathing difficulty, etc. Asthma and CHF are very different entities and need thorough evaluation to identify the cause. 5. Usually, 138/98 is not a greatly elevated BP that causes significant problems, CHF, etc. Such BP can be managed/controlled by salt restriction, life style modifications, relaxation, etc, in most common circumstances. This is the reason I am emphasizing the importance of identifying the cause of your symptoms.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am getting weird feelings in my head.

If all the times cause of your hives and welts is getting upset/anxious, it is possible they are stress-related.2.

If you have symptoms such as frequent diarrhea, palpitations, weight loss, excess sweating, increased appetite, etc also, I would suggest you testing for thyroid disorder (hyperthyroidism), which may be causing repeated periods of anxiousness also. Some hives are related to thyroid abnormalities as well.4. If you have not such physical symptoms, seeking a professional help from psychologist/psychiatrist may also help you.5.

Do you think it would be impossible to find a doctor to prescribe a type one with an a1c of 7 some steroids for seasonal allergies?

I would like to know about your symptoms in detail like since how long, how often, what are your nose, eye,chest symptoms, which medications you used, which forms of steroids you used, dose of insulin for type I diabetes, any other medical conditions, any other medicines, your previous reports, etc etc. This will help me to understand your complaints better and to make more specific suggestions for you.

Sprays and inhalers are very safe as compared to oral forms, and choosing appropriate form may help to ensure minimum side effects with maximum health benefit. 5. Of course, drugs and steroids, mainly \\"control\\" allergy symptoms, they do not improve immunity to improve allergy symptoms.6.

Common side effects of montelukast: headache, nausea, stomach upset, etc minor side effectsLevocetirizine: sedation, drowsiness, etcCiclosenide: an intranasal steroid, usually local side effects like burning, bitter taste in mouth, dryness of inner membrane, etc. General side effects due to steroids can rarely occur with long term use in high dose.3.

As you need to take Ventolin (a rescue type of inhaler) almost everyday, it suggests that your asthma is not well controlled.

Please make sure that your technique of using inhaler is perfect to ensure adequate deposition of drug into lungs.3.

For confirmation of asthma, to rule out other lung disorders (as you had Tb also), I would suggest you spirometry with post-bronchodilator reversibility testing which measures your lung capacity as well as type of obstruction in lung airways.3. Usually diarrhea, weight loss and ankle swelling are not related to asthma. So please consult a physician who will examine you in detail, will review your medical history and medications in great detail and then decide the cause of such symptoms.

I didnt notice because im usually like that when i exercise (bball,skateboarding,biking). depending on how long/hard i exercise ill get a tight chest so its kinda harder to breathe (sometimes if i just push myself harder my chest will burn) and end up feeling congested and ill be coughing a lot.

If you have dry skin (as most of allergic patients have), I would also suggest you regular application of moisturizing lotion/cream, especially immediately after bathing to improve skin moisture. This will help reducing itching.3. Please do not scratch itchy areas, as scratching can aggravate itching.4.

Parasitic infections, viral infections, bacterial infections can cause hives.3. Some conditions/normal activities like sunlight exposure, cold/warm water exposure, exercise, sweating, etc can also cause hives.4. Food allergies and food intolerance can cause hives.5. Hives can also occur due to adverse reactions to preservatives/coloring agents/flavoring agents etc in packed foods/outside foods, some drugs like NSAIDs (used as pain killers), some antibiotics, etc.6. In some patients, hives can be difficult to treat, like those with chronic conditions, autoimmune urticaria, etc.7. Stress can aggravate some hives.8. For treatment viewpoint, I would suggest you to take antihistamine like levocetirizine or cetirizine or fexofenadine for symptom relief.9.

I have a funny one here, funny in both ways.  Yesterday I picked up a bunch of candy I got from a radio station, a year's supply to be exact, as a prize from them.  Most of it has peanuts in it.  I'm allergic, but figured my husband would take some of what I couldn't eat and maybe keep the rest for Halloween for trick or treaters or otherwise give it away.  I actually broke open a couple boxes to give some to someone already, and brought the rest home.  Even though some of the boxes have been opened, all the individual packages inside are fully wrapped.  And the tiny amount my husband tried last night, he put in a ziplock bag and saved it.  That said, is it a pretty safe bet that I'm not feeling itchy on account of this candy since it's fully wrapped anyway?  I should also add that my husband always keeps some peanut energy bars in the pantry also, albeit only a couple small cartons rather than about ten of them as in the case of this new addition.  The stuff my husband stores isn't a problem for me.  What do you think of this?","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. Yes, for persons with peanut allergy, this is very much possible. Wrappers of peanut chocolates contain particles of peanuts which upon coming with contact with skin can cause such small reactions.2. Another possibility is the wrapper may contain some chemicals (preservatives, coloring agents, others, etc) which can irritate skin some some persons.So, in nutshell, it is possible.Hope above information will help you.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

As his nose congestion is not improved with antihistmaines, I would suggest him to use intranasal corticosteroid sprays for 7-14 days. If still his nose obstruction does not improve, I would suggest him to get examined by an ENT surgeon to rule out any structural cause of nose congestion.3. Regular steam inhalation will also help to improve nose congestion.4.

Although there is no direct relation with constipation and cold allergy but there is indirect connection. Constipation is connected with GERD (gastritis, feeling of sour fluid in mouth, etc) and GERD is connected with rhinosinusitis.So it is important that patients with nose obstruction and other nose symptoms along with gastric symptoms keep their bowels perfect.2. As an Allergist-Immunologist, I would like to mention here that such nose symptoms actually may or may not be associated with \\"allergy\\". I would suggest you to get allergy testing done for common air-borne allergens such as house dust mites, molds, pollens, insect proteins, animal dander, etc to know whether you have any allergies.3. Cold air does not cause \\"allergy\\". It is an airway irritant which aggravates any airway related symptoms such as nose obstruction, breathing difficulty, sneezing, nose irritation, etc.4. For my patients who have similar complaints, I suggest them to treat constipation and gastritis simultaneously which will help them in a long run.5.

I was diagnosed with asthma about 20 years ago, and told it was \\"environmentally triggered\\". After about a year of mild breathing problems off and on, I seemed to have \\"gotten over it\\" (if that's even possible). Recently, I have 2 episodes that brought back that frightening feeling of not being able to breathe. The first was during a severe wind storm, where there was a substantial amount of dust in the air, so I went indoors, and within a few hours, I felt a lot better. This was about 9 months ago. Today, the janitor at the school where I work used a VERY strong bleach solution in her mop bucket when cleaning the cafeteria floor, and within minutes I was coughing and experiencing the old familiar tightening of the chest, and difficulty breathing. Almost 6 hours later, I am still coughing a scratchy irritated throat type cough, accompanied by some thicker phlegm, and I am still experiencing moderate difficulty breathing. I seem to be able to inhale pretty deeply, but it doesn't seem like I'm getting much air. =( Could the fumes from the bleach solution have triggered this?","Doctor":"Hi thanks for using healthcaremagic...Asthma is hypersensitivity of the Respiratory system...As a result of the increased response there will be an increased production of secretions ,ie.increased phlegm....Bronchospasm ie.constriction of the respiratory tree...initially starts as cough and later it becomes breathing difficulty..Anything which causes Asthma is called trigger factor...There are so many trigger factors---dust,smell,food....Hence the smell of bleach can irritate the respiratory tree and can act as a trigger factor...Anti-histamine and inhalers can help you...Thank you..."},{"Patient":"I am 20 years old, 162 cm and 101.2 lbs.

First of all, I personally congratulate you for adopting life style changes including Yoga, Pranayama, Surya Namaskaram, Meditation, which help to reduce medicine requirements in chronic disorders such as asthma.Please continue efforts towards improving your body & mind.2. As an Allergist-Immunologist, I would suggest you allergy testing for air borne allergens such as house dust mites, molds, pollens, insect proteins, etc. It will help you identifying the substances causing allergies to you and also to know the measures to avoid them.3. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may suggest you allergen specific immunotherapy which works gradually on immune system to improve allergy symptoms over a long time duration.4. If your requirement of Asthalin inhaler is 3 inhalers (600 metered doses), I would rate it as high. As you have mentioned that it is not working for you recently, I would suggest you a test named Spirometry with post bronchodilator reversibility testing. This test is usually best performed by pulmonologists and it measures your lung capacity and amount of airway obstruction, also the reversibility of the airway obstruction.5. Such testing will help your doctor to decide whether you need rescue inhalers such as Asthalin (salbutamol) or \\"preventer\\" inhalers (such as inhaled corticosteroids) to dilate your constricted airways.6. There are many alternatives to asthalin inhaler such as levosalbutamol or other brands of salbutamol, but at present, from your history, I doubt whether they will be really helpful to you. So I would not suggest them prior to spirometry testing.7. Please try to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.8.

As you have symptoms year around, I usually suggest my such patients regular montelukast + levocetirizine and a preventer inhaler such as inhaled corticosteroids. These should to be taken regularly under physician's guidance to avoid symptoms of asthma.5. For patients with ectopic heartbeats or other heart problems, I usually suggest them to use levosalbutamol in place of salbutamol as levosalbutamol is more safe in terms of cardiac symptoms. Also, regular use of inhaled corticosteroids will reduce your requirement of salbutamol/levosalbutamol.Please note that both salbutamol and levosalbutamol are \\"rescue\\" type of inhalers which are to be used on as-and-when-needed basis. Inhaled corticosteroids are \\"preventer\\" type of inhalers which are to be taken on regular basis.6. Regular breathing exercises will help you in a long run to improve your lung capacity.7. A healthy diet rich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants will also help gradually to improve your immune system. Please note that allergy is a disorder of immune system. Such diet with adequate fluids during day will also improve your symptoms of tiredness.8. In general, please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I am a voice teacher and have one student (an older man in his 60 s) with a wonderful voice, but is plagued by constant phlegm.

His vocal chords are fine according to his doctor.","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your query and would like to make suggestions for him as follows:1. It would be best if he is examined by an ENT specialist because common causes of such complaints are allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, chronic pharyngitis, etc. 2. Singulair (Montelukast) is not an antihistamine. I would suggest him to add an antihistamine (like fexofenadine, cetirizine, levocetirizine, etc) to montelukast, which might work better.3. Regular care of nose and throat like regular steam inhalation (for nose symptoms) and regular warm saline gargles (for throat symptoms) will be helpful to him.4.

Defcort (Deflazacort) is a corticosteroid. For 1 week use, as mentioned my you, common side effect would be gastritis, stomach upset, vomiting, nausea, etc. You can avoid them by taking it after food, if necessary, you can also take antacids simultaneously.2. If you use corticosteroid for prolonged period, possible side effects are numerous, such as hypertension, weight gain, diabetes, cataract, glaucoma, osteoporosis, mental disturbances, skin thinning, etc etc. Also, if you take them for prolonged periods, you should not discontinue immediately; they need to be gradually decreased under guidance of physician.3.

I would also suggest him warm saline gargles, which will help throat.4. If he has wheezing or difficulty in breathing, I would suggest him to use a rescue inhaler like salbutamol or levosalbutamol, as prescribed by his doctor.4.

I called 911 but he was find after the medical persons showed up. his blood pressure was ok and his heart beat is 63 per minutes. he has been taken Ibuprofen for fever relieve for at least 5 times between age 6 to 9. And i recall similar symptoms for each time. But we did not relate that to allergy. We thought it was due to the fever. My question is that has he been permanently damaged due to the serious allergic reaction to Ibuprofen? he has been scheduled to see an allergy specialist. Which type of tests should we do to rule him out from permanent damaging? Thanks, Lin","Doctor":"Hello Lin,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your son's history and would like to make suggestions for him as follows:1. Ibuprofen is a common cause of allergic reactions, however, it is not always a drug that may be causing allergic reactions. It is possible that some additives in the drug formulations which may be causing reactions.2. To decide whether he is truly allergic to ibuprofen, your allergist will take history of each reaction in great detail, including which other drugs were given, whether ibuprofen brand were same or different, etc etc.This will help him to decide whether it is a true allergy or \\"false\\" allergy.3. However, such self-limiting reactions (whether allergic or non-allergic) usually do not cause permanent damage, especially if he is completely normal between reactions.So at present, I would suggest you not to worry about such permanent damage. Unfortunately, there are no tests available identifying or ruling out such damage.4. If he is allergic to ibuprofen, I would suggest him to avoid it in future. There are many other options available for fever/pain symptoms other than ibuprofen.5. For diagnosis of ibuprofen allergy (\\"true\\" allergy), your allergist might suggest him blood testing and skin testing, which should be interpreted by an experienced allergist-immunologist to decide whether he is truly allergic to ibuprofen.Hope above suggestions or information will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your son the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I just had an reaction to my allergy shot: Threw up, rash, redness, trouble breathing, etc. The office is now closed for a holiday party so I can't return.

Question-what should I do?","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. From your symptoms, respiratory symptoms, urticaria and swellings (angioedema), I would first think of anaphylaxis reaction to mushrooms. So I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will ask your symptoms in very much detail, including what, apart from mushrooms, did you consume before development of symptoms, each and everything. After detailed history taking, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergy testing. These are important steps to confirm cause of anaphylaxis.2. Anaphylaxis, in simple language, is a serious allergic reaction. Unfortunately not too many tests are available to confirm its diagnosis. So it is best diagnosed by detailed history and supportive investigations.3. If you are allergic to mushrooms, best option in my opinion is avoidance of mushrooms in future.4. As you have still swollen hands, I would suggest you an antihistamine like chlorpheniramine for 3-5 days. Please note that it may cause sedation.5. Such food allergies are usually not hereditary. So I would not suggest to worry from your daughter's side if she has not had any reactions to mushrooms.6. For you also, please avoid mushrooms till you visit an Allergist-Immunologist and diagnosis of allergy/anaphylaxis is confirmed/ruled out. Further plan will depend upon your diagnosis.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello, I had an endoscopy and colonoscopy yesterday.

Wheezing can only be confirmed by listening to chest by stethoscope. So if your doctor has diagnosed wheezing, you can trust him/her for diagnosis.2. As you have first episode of wheezing, it can be due to viral infection. So you should not worry about anything serious at present. Such episodes improve with medicines and usually the patient completely recovers within 2-4 weeks.So I would suggest you to complete medications prescribed by your doctor.3. If you have repeated episodes of wheezing, in future, then only one has to think about chronic diseases like asthma, etc.4. To make you understand \\"wheezing\\", it means whistle like sound coming from chest due to narrowed respiratory tubes (bronchi), which can be due to infections, bronchitis, asthma, and many other possible causes. Actually, wheezing is a sign and not a diagnosis.Hope above information will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"My son fell off his bunk bed whilst playing and landed on his back.

It is possible to have nose bleed due to rhinitis or dry air exposure, especially due to heavy pricking nose. But in general, nose bleeds have no relation with asthma.2. If bleeds are minor, moisturizing inner surface of nose by using frequent saline drops would help. Also, putting ice over nose bridge may help during bleeding.3. If bleeds are major and not stopping, in that case I would suggest you to take him to pediatrician and get him examined.4.

I would agree that when such skin lesions occur, topical corticosteroids such as clobetasol can provide relief. So I would agree with this treatment.2. To identify the allergy, I would suggest you to observe yourself regarding exposure.For example, as it occurs on feet and palms, is it related to particulr type of socks and gloves? etc.If you are able to find out any such association, you should avoid such exposure in future.3. When your skin is good and normal, I would suggest you to apply moisturizing lotion over all dry skin areas, which would improve your skin and reduce itching.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I am taking naprosyn and levocetirizine.

Naprosyn can cause wheezing. If you think naprosyn causes/increases wheezing, I would suggest you to avoid it.

Levocetirizine usually does not cause wheezing. On the contrary, if you have nose symptoms like rhinitis also, I would suggest you to take an antihistamine like levocetirizine.3.

Somebody told allergy test is useful for this..isnt it ?...please help me to solve this problem.Awaiting ur reply. Thank you","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. Common side effects of Asthalin (salbutamol) rotacaps are tremors, palpitations, increased heart rate, etc. However, inhaled salbutamol is better than tablet salbutamol.However, if you need to take 2-3 rotacaps daily, it is not recommended as per my opinion. It suggests that your asthma is not well controlled and you need to take regular asthma controller/preventer medications. 2. I usually suggest my such patients regular montelukast, levocetirizine and inhaled corticosteroids for at least 6 weeks. Please use Asthalin (salbutamol) rotacaps for as-and-when-needed use only and not on regular basis.3. I also do not prescribe decongestant nose sprays (such as otrivin) for more than 3 days at a stretch. As there is possibility of rebound nose congestion/obstruction upon stopping such nose sprays. As suggested above, montelukast and levocetirizine will work for allergic rhinitis.3. I would also suggest you allergy testing for common air-borne allergens such as house dust mites, molds, pollens, insect proteins, animal dander, etc. It will help you identify the substances causing allergies to you and also to know how to avoid them.4. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to gradually improve allergy symptoms.5.

Regular exercise and a healthy diet will also help you in a long run by improving lung capacity and immunity respectively.7.

With such combined efforts, one can have a improved life with minimum possible use of medications.

It will appear on the next or next two days after I ate the food which will cause my allergy.As advised by doctor, I had took a 10 day course of Aerius and Asthator.  The rashes came back 5 days after my course had ended.  Then, I took Loratadine for another 10 days.  Like previous, the rashes came back after 5 or 6 days after my course had ended.  I noticed that the allergy reaction and area affected become more serious each time I stopped.  Now, it even appear on my arms, waist, swollen on my lips, cheek, eye lids, neck.  My lips or eye lids will swollen 15-30 min later if I ate the food which will cause the allergy.Currently, I follow the advice from a doctor, not to completely stop eating food that will trigger the allergy to let my body to accept the food.  I will only take Loratadine if the rashes appear a lots.Pls advise what should I do to stop or cure this forever?","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. Of course, I would first think of \\"Chronic Urticaria\\" as a diagnosis, but it is important to find the cause.2. As you have symptoms after taking prawn, crab, shrimp, etc. I would suggest you to go for allergy testing (both serum specific IgE and skin prock tests for sea foods). This will help to know whether you are actually allergic to sea foods. (sea foods are very common to cause food allergies and avoidance is the best measure)3. However, as you have chronic urticaria and also, as you develop symptoms after 1-2 days of consumption, I would suggest you other investigations for chronic urticaria also.For my chronic urticaria patients, I advise Complete blood counts with ESR, C-reactive protein, serum ANA, thyroid profile, complete urine and stool analysis as primary investigations. However, I would mention here that nearly 25% of patients with chronic urticaria have all normal reports.4. For treatment purpose, I would suggest you to avoid foods that cause your reactions (the most important aspect of any allergy, I would disagree with th concept of \\"acceptance by body\\"). 5. I would also like to review your other medications like pain-killers, contraceptives, and some others which might be contributing to urticaria.6. I usually suggest my such patients to take an antihistamine like hydroxyzine or fexofenadine or loratadine for 6 weeks regularly.7. I also suggest them to avoid too hot/spicy foods and sudden temperature differences. Woolen, tight clothing can also irritate skin and hence not preferable for urticaria patients.8. I usually prescribe my such patients a good multivitamin-multimineral supplement and high dose vitamin D after checking vitamin D levels, which might help in some chronic urticaria.9. If psychological stress is a concern for you, please adopt some relaxation strategies as stress can worsen urticaria.10. Please do not scratch the itchy areas as it aggravates itching. I would suggest you to apply a lotion like calamine over itchy areas instead of scratching them.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I had a rash on my arm, and my doctor prescribed prednisone (12 days ).  I finished it a week ago Sunday, and the rash is coming back.  He said it's an allergic reaction, but we're not sure to what.  Will this go away on it's own?  Is there something I can put on it?","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. If you have this complaints for the first time, I would prescribe you an antihistamine like fexofenadine or hydroxyzine or loratadine for 14 days.2. I would also suggest you to apply a lotion like calamine over itchy areas.3. Please do not scratch the itchy areas as it aggravates itching. 4. If you have recent intestinal symptoms or recent travel, I would suggest you an anti-parasitic medicine for 3 days as sometimes intestinal parasites can also cause such symptoms.5. I usually use corticosteroids (prednisolone) for resistant hives/rashes. I do not prefer to use them as first drugs as they have many side effects.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I have had a serious allergic reaction to cephalexin (lost the use of my legs), also got the same reaction from another antibiotic while in hospital, so should I worry about taking clindamycin? I also get asthma occasionally and have other allergies. I also have atrial fibrillatiom and take meds for that.","Doctor":"Cephalexin belongs to a group of medicines of penicillins. There can be a lot of cross reactivity in the groups and hence you should avoid the beta lactam group of drugs. However such reactivity is not seen with fluoroquinolones and Clindamycin. You can be allergic to other drugs also but we cannot know that unless u take the drug. What u can do is take a small dose and try. If you are fine then further increase to full doses."},{"Patient":"Hi, the underneath of my eyes have been really itchy and so one morning I woke up and one eye was swollen, not that big though. It was really itchy and it was peeling. My lips break out and swell every three months, anyways the allergy doctor found out I was allergic to chapstick and Vaseline. The Vaseline I was using had an active ingredient of flavor which was causing a reaction so he said I probably touched my mouth, then my eyes. But I've always used Vaseline before it doesn't make sense. Thank you for your time.","Doctor":"yes it can cause side effects ranging from...Mild itching, burning, or stinging to SEVERE side effects like ..Severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue); severe or persistent itching, burning, or stinging; skin irritation; worsening dryness...hope i have answered your query..."},{"Patient":"I was taking Symbicort for 2 months, and my asthma was the best it has ever been ever. Prior to that I used to wake up every night from asthma having to take my ventolin. I never needed to use my ventolin since I was on the Symbicort which was great. But I was a bit silly and didnt realise my symbicrt inhaler ran out, so my asthma got really bad to the point where I couldn't go to work, and when i took my ventolin it appeared to no longer work on me. Could I be having withdrawals from the Symbicort? Or could it be that I hadn't taken the ventolin for so long that my body doesn't want it anymore?","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. To address your main queries - withdrawals from Symbicort? - one can say that in common man's terms, but actually it is not withdrawal in scientific sense. (as explained in No 2).Body does not need Ventolin anymore - it is not a correct interpretation.2. Asthma is a chronic disorder. Most of the \\"controller drugs\\" for asthma (such as Symbicort) actually only \\"control\\" the symptoms of asthma but cannot \\"cure\\" asthma. So when one stops such controlled medications, one experiences return of asthma symptoms.3. Ventolin is a \\"rescue\\" type of drug. It is to be used only for symptom relief when symptoms occur. However, frequent intake of such medications is not desirable, so in that case one needs to take \\"controller\\" type of inhalers on regular basis. This is as happened in your case.4. I usually my such patients to take minimum dose of \\"controller\\" medications regularly that controls all their asthma symptoms. For example, I would suggest my patient regular inhaler (like Symbicort) and montelukast. In addition, I would suggest him to take salbutamol inhaler on as-and-when-needed  basis.5. Were I treating you, I would also suggest you allergy testing for common air-borne allergens like house dust mites, molds, pollens, insect proteins, pet dander (if you have pet) etc. This will help you identify substances causing allergies to you as well as to know the measures to avoid them.6. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works gradually on immune system to improve allergy symptoms on a long term basis.7. Regular breathing exercises and a healthy nutrition will also help you in a long run by improving your lung capacity and immunity respectively.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Sir I hv dust and smoke alerge form 7 yr  but it's nt asthma    iam using  tis medicine  from 2 yr wen I feel  hard to breath   ill take it  but   oly in winters ill get tis problem  in summer so..... plz giv some suggestions   iam suffering much from tis but wen I take tis ill bcm free","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to know more about you like - a. what is your age? b. how frequent are your symptoms? c.

Do you have any other medical conditions? f. Do you take any other medicines frequently? Above details are necessary to help you better.However, at present, I would like to make suggestions for you from your given information as follows:1. I usually prescribe my such patients regular montelukast and levocetirizine. I also prescribe them salbutamol inhaler to be used on as-and-when-needed basis.2. I would suggest you allergy testing for common air-borne allergens such as house dust mites, molds, insect proteins, pollens and pet dander (if you have pet).

Based on allergy testing report, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which gradually works on immune system to improve allergy symptoms over a long period.4.

Regular breathing exercise and a healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals also would help you to improve your lung capacity and immunity respectively over a long duration.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi,  Jody Freeman,  On Thursday Feb 13th 2014,  I got up from the sofa and had a severe pain in middle of lower abdonimal area. a dull pain all the time.

He takes two shots every four weeks. He is now sixteen years old and his school/sports schedule makes it hard to keep up with it. On top of that the allergy doctor seems to have to many patients to keep up with. Can he just stop taking shots or do you have to be weaned off them?","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your son's history and would like to make suggestions for him as follows:1. In general, for allergy shots, the more longer you continue, more longer the benefits last. Minimum duration of allergy shots is 3-5 years, but sometimes life long treatment is necessary. This depends upon what allergy he has, for what allergic disorder he is put on allergy shots, how the response of treatment has been (how much improvement), etc.2. Before planning to stop allergy shots, I also suggest my patients allergy testing for the allergen for which shots were given. The size of allergic reaction also might help deciding the duration of allergy shots.3. As such there is no \\"weaning\\" for allergy shots but if it is possible to stay symptom free with minimum number of shots, it is desirable to continue them.4. So, to summarize, this is a highly individualized decision that requires a lot of information about the patients as well as discussion about pros and cons between doctor and patient/parents.Personally I would suggest you not to stop allergy shots by yourself, discuss the inconvenience with your allergist-immunologist and then decide further.Hope above information will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your son the best of the healthy life ahead.Thank you & regards."},{"Patient":"my daughter had a asthma attack the weekend and was taken into hospital for three days she was nebuliser very two hours and then put on oral steroids prednisolone eight a day.

Usually drugs used in asthma attack (including steroids) do not cause such anxiety symptoms. Excess dose of salbutamol can cause palpitations ,tremors, etc but do not cause sad and \\"impending bad\\" feelings. So I would not first think of such feelings due to treatment of asthma attack.2. As she has been put on Fluoxetine, I assume she has some psychiatric disorder. May be those feelings are manifestation of the same psychiatric disorder. So, were I treating her, I would suggest her to follow-up at her treating psychiatrist to discuss regarding the symptoms o anxiety and depression.3. In future, I would highly recommend her stress reduction, relaxation and meditation to improve her anxiety symptoms as psychological stress can worsen asthma control and can trigger an asthma attack.Hope above information will be helpful to your daughter.Wish her the best of the health and a very good recovery ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I M 33 YEARS old HIGHT 5FOOT 5 INCHES WEIGHT 63 KGS last year i go for full body check up and reports are all normal so can i do it this year also and i have a problem of cold astama so i dont able to have any cold water or ice so for that what type of precautation i have to take. i m staying in kolkata.

The best management of known allergies causing anaphylactic reactions is avoidance of the food you are allergic to. Unfortunately there is no 100% \\"curative\\" treatment for such food allergies.Hence my humble suggestion to you would be avoidance of pine nuts in all forms. Please also avoid those food items which contain pine nuts as ingredients.2. As you have a serious anaphylactic reaction requiring epinephrine, future management plan would be to keep a epinephrine pen along with you for unanticipated anaphylactic reactions. It can be life saving in such accidental unanticipated reaction. Please consult an Allergist who will prescribe you such a pen for self-use and also teach you how to use it and when to use it.Hope above suggestions and information will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"My daughter recently came in contact with poison oak.

Please avoid exposure to excessive sunlight, extremes of temperature, too hot/spicy foods/liquids, if they are aggravating hives.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead and a very good recovery.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello I am a 60yr old woman, weighing 54kgs and my height is 4.8''.

Montek-LC (Montelukast + Levocetirizine) can control symptoms of allergic cough-cold. So it is desirable that you take it as long as you have symptoms if you are not experiencing side effects.Common side effects of montelukast+levocetirizine are sedation, drowsiness, stomach upset, etc. However, if you are not experiencing any of them, you can take it safely for years together.2. For long term relief of allergy, I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will suggest you allergy testing and allergen specific immunotherapy.3. Were I treating you, I would suggest you allergy testing for common allergy causing substances such as house dust mites, molds, common pollens, insect proteins, pet dander (if you have pet).4. Based on allergy testing, I would prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to gradually improve allergy symptoms and reduces requirements of medicines over time.5. In general, I would suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.6. Regular breathing exercises and a healthy diet will also help you by improving your immune system gradually.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi.

Sometimes some vitamin deficiencies like niacin can also cause skin problems in sun exposed areas.3. Were I treating you, I would suggest you to take an antihistamine like hydroxyzine for 30 days. I would also prescribe you a good multivitamin-multimineral containing especially vitamin B complex, vitamin E and zinc.4. If you can correlate your symptoms to sun exposure, I would suggest you to apply a sunscreen lotion ( minimum SPF 15)at least 30 minutes before going into sun.5. If you can correlate your symptoms to any specific jewellery, the best thing in my opinion would be to avoid wearing that particular jewellery. Common jewellery that can cause such symptoms usually contain nickel within them as a metal.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"My doctor said I have an lower respiratory infection and gave me levaquin later I found out she gave me that because she thought I had asthma and copd.

Please suggest montek lc is worth taking.    Please suggest some medicines and natural treatment and a healthy lifestyle for me. Thanks in advance","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. First of all, I would like to know what is the frequency of your asthma episodes to make more helpful suggestions. I also would like to know what are the current medications you are taking and how they are effective.2. However, in general, I would like to suggest you to take montelukast-levocetirizine (Montek-LC) in regular basis. I would also suggest you to use salbutamol inhaler on as-and-when-needed basis for asthma symptoms. If asthma symptoms are not controlled by above, I would suggest you to use regular asthma controller inhalers.3. I would also suggest you allergy testing for common airborne allergens - house dust mites, insect proteins, mold proteins, pollens, and pet dander (if you have a pet). This will help you to identify the substances you may be allergic to and also to know measures to avoid them.4. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to gradually improve allergy symptoms. I would like to mention here that most of the medicines except immunotherapy can only \\"control\\" asthma symptoms but they do not improve allergy.5. In general, I would suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution.5. I congratulate for asking about natural treatment and healthy life style as many allergies-asthma have life-style roots. Natural remedies containing ginger, turmeric, black pepper, basil, etc are known to improve allergy-asthma symptoms.6. A balanced diet rich in vitamins, minerals and anti-oxidants (i.e., adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc) will also improve your immune system gradually.7. Regular physical exercise and breathing exercises including Pranayama & Yoga will also help you by improving your immunity and lung capacity in a long run.8. If stress is an important factor in your life, regular meditation and relaxation practices will also help as stress can worsen allergies & asthma.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"suffer   with asthma   uses  nebuliser   4 times a day as well as in halers,  went down with a chest infection which affected  the asthma, given  amoxycillin  500mg  and prednisolone 30mg, developed  a  cold on top  but can not stop going into  coughings  spasms  which is    making me  exhausted, tried  simple   linctus      pavacoldol  meds and honey and  lemon  to no no  avail, please  advise","Doctor":"hi,nowadays we have good medications for asthma. get lung function test done and treatment accordingly. you can be completely symptoms free with good medications. get allergy  test to know the triggers and IMMUNOTHWERAPY which can cure allergy"},{"Patient":"For the past few days I have waken up and noticed it is very hard to open my eyes because there is a lot of sleep in my eyes, the yellow hard substance.

I excercise regularly and occasionally get bad headaches from shortness of breath.  Been to doctors and they just tell me my lungs are clear and give me an antibiotic and/or an inhaler.","Doctor":"The inner lining of our sinuses as well as the respiratory tract has lining of small projections called cilia which beat in a definite direction and help in bringing out the dirt and mucus. This is called muco ciliary clearance. But the smoking has damaged the ciliated epithelium and hence this clearance is disturbed. Hence you need to cough out the thick mucus instead of it automatically coming out even after you have quitted. This is also responsible for the sinusitis and the infective agents do not get cleared out from the sinuses. Since the lungs have also been damaged to some degree while you were smoking, you sometimes have respiratory distress or shortness of breath. It will take significant time to recover and will recover only to a near normal stage. You will have to be patient till then. Steam inhalation on regular basis may help."},{"Patient":"I am suffering from allergy some respiratory problem during early day time.

( I am 61 years old, a retired nurse, interested in nutrition, but do have BP problems.  Any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome to health care magic.Thanks for your query. Since you have a long history of allergy and you feel that taking fish oil will precipitate allergy, you should avoid it and take other supplements such as walnut,  Sardines and soyabeans. These supplements are rich sources of omega -3 fatty acids. Because the psychological feeling of allergy about the fish oil could probably cause problems.For your blood pressure reduce your salt intake, do walking or cycling daily and if possible you can practice meditation.Check your blood pressure after practicing these life style modifications after 2 weeks. If your blood pressure is high consult a physician for hypertensive medication prescription. Consult a general physician and take further suggestions.Wish you a good health.Thank you.Dr. Kidev.s."},{"Patient":"i have a rash that started two weeks ago, first in my chest and now it has spread all over the torso, front and back..started with small pumps and they turn to some kind of lesions..second day on predisone but doesn't seem to help...any ideas..regular dr thought last week that it's some kind of allergic reaction but it shouldn't last this long if it was?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome...Rashes has a list i.of causes ..Yours could be the allergy BUT the pattern of its spread is not suggestive of allergy and its pointing to some kind of infection.What ki d of rash is this?

I woke up this morning itching, my palms, my ears are red, slightly swollen and itching? Could I be reacting to the anti biotic? I have never had any allergic reactions to any anti biotics before?","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. Amoxycillin is one of the most common drugs causing allergic reactions. So usually it is suspected first as a cause of allergic reactions.2. However, there are other possibilities also: you could have a reaction due to any other drug that you might have taken (for fever, pain, etc) or you could have an allergic reaction to any of the excipients (colors, additives, preservatives, etc) that are part of all drug formulations.3. Sometimes, some if the infections have itchy rash as a part of illness, so may be your rash was the part of the natural course of illness.4. Whatever the cause may be, I would suggest you not to worry about it at present and take an antihistamine like cetirizine or levocetirizine for 2-3 days and apply calamine lotion over it.5. Please inform about your itchy rash to your doctor so he can review all your medications and may decide what it was that caused your reaction. Depending upon his judgment, he may advise you to stop some particular drug. Also, allergy testing is available for some of the drugs to confirm any drug allergy, if you have.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I have a respiratory infection and asthma.

This seems to flare up mostly at night. I have two cats and I m not sure if I have allergies.","Doctor":"HelloWelcome to health care magicThanks for your query. I think in your case first we have to evaluate you properly before diagnosing you as an asthmatic or you had developed allergy towards your cats.First you should take a chest X-ray and consult with a pulmonologist to rule out other pulmonary conditions. A simple peak flow meter testing for peak expiratory flow rate will give an idea about you problems. Further your can stay away from your cats and see if you get better.To confirm your allergic condition you can do specific IgE tests or radioallergosorbent tests (RASTs).Treatment for your pulmonory problem might involve administration of antibiotic therapy, anti-histaminic therapy (such as citrizine), and salbutamol can be helpful for the relief of bronchospasm (Chest Tightness).Consult pulmonologist and take further suggestionsWish you a good health.Dr Kidev.S"},{"Patient":"Am having allegic asthama since my childhood,I am serious about my health taking precautions regarding dos n donts.

I am confused","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. Were I treating you, first of all I would like to know more about your symptoms in detail. Depending upon frequency of your symptoms and severity of your symptoms only, I would be able to say whether you need inhalers and what type of inhalers. (There are two types of inhalers - rescue type to be used for symptoms relief and controller type for regular use)2. I would at least suggest you regular montelukast which would help in allergic asthma and may reduce your requirement of inhalers. 3. In general, inhalers are safer than oral tablets as they act directly into lungs and hence dose required is small. Enuring right type of inhaler with correct technique also is important to minimize the dose of inhalers.4. I would also suggest you allergy testing which will help you identify the substances causing allergies to you as well as to know how to avoid their exposure. Based on allergy testing report, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on your immune system to improve your allergy symptoms for long term.5. In addition to above, I would also suggest you to have a regular exercise schedule and a healthy diet rich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants with improves your immunity gradually.6. Regular breathing exercises, Pranayama and Yoga also will gradually improve your lung capacity.To summarize regarding your main query for inhalers, I would like to say that inhalers are better than orally taken drugs, and they need to be taken if they are necessary for you. Please follow your doctor's advice regarding inhaler use. Please learn proper technique of using inhaler and avoid the substances which are worsening your allergies/asthma.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"For about two months now I've been having nausea.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Even though it requires a clinical assessment for a proper diagnosis, from the history of pain in lower abdomen specially in the groin area would lead our suspicion towards a developing inguinal hernia.

What can I do to break this cycle?","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicThe only way to completely eliminate the allergic response to an allergen would be to prevent or decrease exposure as much as possible.This means that you would need to eliminate any dust mites in your bedding and sofa.In addition, you should have your house and , if possible, work environment, assessed for mold and this should also be eliminated.Once you continue to be exposed, the symptoms would continue.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"I am allergic to wasp.

Are ther anymore symptoms I should watch for?","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicIf you are allergic to wasp stings, then it can potentially cause a severe allergic reaction.Immediate treatment would involve the use of oral antihistamines. If the oral antihistamine is not  having an effect or your symptoms are worsening then you should seek medical attention.IF the area is painful the use of anti inflammatory pain medication such as cataflam, ibuprofen or naproxen may help.Symptoms and signs of allergic reaction are: weals, itching, nasal symptoms, in  severe reactions- swelling of the tongue, chest pain, shortness of breath, wheezing, dizzinessI hope this helps"},{"Patient":"I have experienced Anyaphalaxtic shock 5 times and break out in hives daily.

Please note that allergic swelling (angioedema) may take 2-3 days to resolve. As you have to go to school day after tomorrow, above treatment will definitely cause good improvement by then.3.

The most important thing I would like to know is whether you have only itching or itching with rash/hives. As the causes differ completely.2. At present, I assume you have no rashes/hives. I would suggest you to apply moisturizing lotion over dry skin and itchy areas immediately after bath regularly for at least 2-3 weeks.3. I would also suggest you to take a multivitamin-multimineral containing especially vitamin A, vitamin E, zinc, selenium and essential fatty acids for at least 2-3 months to improve you skin.4. Apart from above measures, I would suggest you to take an antihistamine like fexofenadine or levocetirizine in the morning and hydroxyzine before going to bed (because hydroxyzine can cause sedation) for control of itching.Please note that these antihistamines only control itching, will not cure the cause of your itching.Once your skin is improved with suggestions no 2 & 3, you yourself can gradually reduce the antihistamines and eventually stop them.5.

Please see your pediatrician before starting for Leh-Ladakh. Please ask him for action plan for asthma symptoms - how to recognize an asthma attack, which drugs to be used, when to be used and what should be the dosage.4. Going to Leh-Ladakh can make effects on your child's health in multiple ways: a. Low oxygen levels generally would not cause problem to a normal 11 year boy, but should he have an attack of asthma, low oxygen concentration could make the attack more severe.b. Change in environment and exposure to cold air are potential triggers for asthma attacks.c. A rapid ascent to high altitude can cause changes in lung physiology and may precipitate pulmonary edema (in any normal individual, no relation with asthma). Symptoms of pulmonary edema should be differentiated from those of an asthma attack.5. You can observe following precautions:a. Plan a gradual ascent by making frequent halts while traveling. You may plan a night-stay while ascent in between so that all the persons can acclimatize.b. Avoid exposure to dry, cold air currents. Covering ears, nose and mouth openings with think warm clothes would do this.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your son and family a happy and healthy travel.

Side effects of corticosteroids are numerous - obesity, hypertension, diabetes, cataract, glaucoma, reduced immunity, gastritis, reduced libido, osteoporosis, personality changes, etc etc.However, such side effects are more commonly seen with oral steroids. They are seen only with long term use of high dose inhaled corticosteroids. Gargling after each use also reduces absorption of steroids into body as you have been already doing.2. Common side effects of inhaled corticosteroids are oral thrush, change in voice, local irritation, etc. 3.

There are many causes of chronic cough. I would like to know more about him like - a. Has he ever had wheezing/breathing difficulty? b. Has he ever required nebulization? c. Does he have nose symptoms like running nose, nose obstruction, sneezing, etc? d. Does he have regurgitation of sour fluids after taking heavy/spicy foods? e. Does he have headache, post-nasal drip, facial heaviness, etc? f. Does he have any family member with allergies/asthma? g. Is he routinely exposed to dusts, smokes or air pollution? h. Does he have weight loss, loss of appetite, etc?Above details would help me to think of possible causes of chronic cough. Further investigations could be suggested based on the details.2. As your current diagnosis is asthma, I would like to mention that asthma can be diagnosed by spirometry with post-bronchodilator reversibility test. 3. I would also suggest him allergy testing, which will help you identify the substances he may be allergic to and also to know the measures to avoid them.4. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe him allergen specific immunotherapy which gradually improves allergy symptoms by working on immune system.5. For asthma, I would also suggest him taking montelukast regularly as a controller medication.6. Personally, I would not suggest him to avoid outdoor activity and restrict him life for many reasons - a. physical activities are very important for improving immunity and lung capacity, which help improve asthma control. b. Restrictions at his age of 13 could have psychological consequences. c. With proper use of controller medications and management of allergies, most of the asthma patients can live life without any limitations.7. Sensory neuropathic cough or cough variant asthma are better diagnosed by experts, usually pediatric pulmonologists. I would suggest you not to be confused by the ocean of information that is available on internet. Thorough history taking, physical examination and prompt use of investigations is required for making diagnosis of a chronic cough.8. Omalizumab can be helpful in some subsets of allergic asthma/rhinitis, but it is not the first drug to be used. It should be used only by experienced doctors when common drugs are not effective/cause side effects. 9.

Pulmicort helps in respiratory allergies, especially asthma. It will not help in hives.  2. For hives, I would suggest you to give him antihistamine like fexofenadine, levocetirizine or cetirizine. Benadryl also is an antihistamine, only thing is it causes more sedation. As effects of antihistamine wanes after some hours, one may need to give them repeatedly for 3-5 days.3. Oral steroids help hives, but due to lots of possible side effects, I would not suggest you to give him oral steroids for hives. They should be given only for severe hives and that only on prescription of a doctor.4. I would agree with you that I would also suggest him allergy testing for food allergies. If he is allergic to food, that particular food should be avoided.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your son the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

As you have long standing symptoms and severe symptoms, were I treating you, I would suggest you intranasal corticosteroid spray (mometasone or fluticasone) upon awakening in the morning for 14 days. I would also suggest you to take monteluakst and cetirizine for at least 2-3 months daily before going to bed.Both the above drugs will improve your symptoms significantly.2. To identify the allergies, I would suggest you allergy testing, especially for common air-borne allergens like house dust mites, indoor molds, insect proteins and pet dander (if you have pet).This will help you identify the substances you may be allergic to and also to know the measures to avoid them.3.Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to gradually improve your allergy symptoms over a long period.4. In general, I would suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.5. Regular breathing exercises and a healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals (plenty of green leafy vegetables, fresh fruits, sprouts, etc) will also help you in a long run by improving your lung capacity and immunity respectively.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I am having asthma for three years.

If you feel breathless despite taking regular inhalers, it suggests you asthma is not adequately controlled and I would suggest you increasing your controller medications after consulting your physician.2. Were i treating you, I would suggest you to add montelukast regularly which also is a controlled medication for allergies-asthma.3.

Regular breathing exercises and a healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals (plenty of green vegetables, fresh fruits, sprouts, etc) will also help you in a long run by improving your lung capacity and immunity respectively.7. Usually asthma episodes do not require antibiotics as most of the attacks are triggered by allergens (allergy causing substances) or viral infections. So I would suggest you not to take antibiotics without doctor's prescription.8.

Bites can become infected when bacteria is introduced from under the nails during itching.It is not likely that they are linked to the cold that you are currently fighting.The use of topical antibiotics may help but if they do not resolve with topical treatment then oral antibiotics would be needed.You should also consider repellent to prevent further bites.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"hello doctor, from the past two years i have been suffering from breathlessness.

I would suggest you to take simple anti-allergy tablets like Loratadine(lorfast), they usually do not cause any side effects other than sedation.So usually it is safe to take such medicines for long time.2. I usually do not prescribe any antibiotic for allergic reactions as allergic reactions are not due to infections. So there is no role of giving any antibiotic like Roxid or Aziwok. However, as your doctor has prescribed you an antibiotic, I would suggest you to complete the course or to consult your doctor before making any change. Common side effects of Aziwok are stomach upset, pain in abdomen, gastritis, etc.3. Anti-allergic medicines can only give symptoms relief, they usually do not remove the cause. So I would suggest you to identify the allergies. Common causes of allergies on face are cosmetics, for example. Avoidance is the best strategy to avoid allergic reactions.4.

Exercise-induced asthma and night attacks of asthma indicate that your asthma is not well-controlled with drugs. Were I treating you, I would suggest you regular use of asthma controller medications like daily montelukast and inhaled corticosteroids. 2. If you are already on regular controller medications, I would suggest you to consult your doctor and upgrade your controlled medicines.3. As you have specifically asked about running/jogging, I will strongly emphasize on starting running/jogging as well as improve control of asthma. Please do not withhold yourself from exercise out of fear of exercise induced attacks.This is, because asthma is basically a disease related to immune system (of course, affecting lung airways) and regular physical exercise is very helpful in improving immune system and asthma in a long run. So I would suggest you to increase your medications to control asthma, start running/jogging and once asthma is improved, medications could be safely stepped down under your doctor's guidance. But please do not withhold yourself from physical exercise.4.

I would like to know since when you are using Seroflo inhaler. I would like to mention here that it is a \\"preventer\\" type of inhaler which is to be used on regular basis regardless of your symptoms under your doctor's guidance.Please make sure your technique of using inhaler is perfect as it is very important to ensure delivery of drugs into lungs.2. I would suggest you allergy testing for common allergy causing air-borne substances - house dust mites, molds, common pollens in your region, insect proteins, pet dander (if you have pets).This will help you to identify the substances causing allergies to you as well as to know the measures to avoid them.3. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which gradually improves your immune system to reduce allergy symptoms over a long period.4. I would also suggest you to use salbutamol inhaler on as-and-when-needed basis for wheezing/breathlessness symptoms.5. Regular breathing exercises, physical activities and a healthy nutrition are very important as they improve lung capacity and immunity respectively on long term basis.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"i hav allergy problem since almost 4 years...i usd a nasal spray 4 2 years... i almost stopd my treatmnt bt nw i again gt d problem currently m using novoliser n nasal spray i hav been using both since 2 months... n m stil using dem. wud dere  b side effects? answr","Doctor":"Hello As you mentioned that you are having allergy and for this used nasal spray .You got relief and now symptoms recurs , this is an indication of allergic rhinitis and your doctor prescribed novolizer i.e. salbutamol . These symptoms are due to bronchoconstriction and novolizer ( salbutamol ) is bronchodilator ,hence you got relief .You can use this medicine , even for years without any side effects .However in the beginning few patients feel fine skeletal muscle tremors , palpitation, tachycardia hypotension but once medicine adjusted in body ,patient don't feel such side effects.So you can take this drug till your doctor advise .Coffee ( hot ) and steam inhalation also provide relief.Good luck."},{"Patient":"Since last year specially in the early mornings i get sneezing continuously.......I went to doctor, and he prescribed me MONDESLOR (montelukast), which seems to help, but as i don't want to get addicted to it, i take it only on as needed basis, but if i don't take medicine in every two days then the symptoms get worse, so I am taking it on every second day..........plz suggest me what it could and how will i control it as I don't want to go like this............","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1.

I am obviously building an immunity to Reactine.Can I take another Reactine pill?Thanks, Brian","Doctor":"As well as swelling of the tongue, you could experience hives, itching, shortness of breath or rapid breathing or changes in the color of your tongue. Swollen lips tongue can result from an allergic reaction to medications, foods, bee stings and pollen. If you experience a more serious attack, called anaphylactic shock, You should consult a doctor immediatly .Treatment for your swollen tongue  lips depends on the condition that caused it and could be anything from a course of drugs  and  gargling with a salt solution will be helpfull .

Before using Tirlor i took past three months PLAQUINAL tablet but no use still allergy is there. doctor advised not to take high protein food, like seafoods, eggs, beef etc. or can foods or preservative items, please advises what to do","Doctor":"Hi. Thank you for writing to HCM.The medications you are on are anti-allergy medications (Loratidine, Cetrizine and Montelukast). These usually reduce the symptoms of allergy but do not avoid the triggering facter. Therefore, you may feel better with these medications transiently and then your symptoms of allergy may recur if you are still exposed to the allergen (may be food, dust, perfumes etc.)It is therefore my recommendation that you evaluate yourself for the allergens you are allergic to. Realistically this is impossible and allergy is a lifelong condition, however some tests such as the Skin prick allergy test can help identify from about 200 common allergens. This will help you know exactly what to avoid and maybe pursue a desensitization therapy.Also there are newer and less sedative anti allergy medications such as fexofenadine that comes in combination with mast cell stabilizers which you can take if the current medications do not help for 3-4 weeks.Hope this helps.

Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. Even though it needs clinical assessment for a diagnosis, from your history, it seems that you have inflammation/calculi in your gall bladder/biliary system giving rise to such intermittent severe pain. If I were your doctor, I would advise you to avoid fatty/oily food which would precipitate the pain more due to contraction of the gall bladder to empty bile into the intestines.  I would advise you a bland diet, some routine investigations like a CBC, a blood sugar, liver function test, a serum amylase and lipase to rule out associated panreatitis, and an ultrasound abdomen to see the status of the biliary tree including the gall bladder to exclude a stone causing cholecystitis and also to know the status of the pancreas. Further management would depend on the result of clinical examination and reports of the related investigations. Till then you could go for an anti spasmodic along with a proton pump inhibitor for a symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery.

Liver is not damaged on a single insult caused by the alcohol, but it happens due to chronic repeated insults as is happening in your case. Gradually it might lead to cirrhosis leading to portal hypertension and hapatic failure. Therefore, I would advise you to quit alcohol completely and modify your life style towards the following:1) Routine regular exercises depending on your medical fitness2) More of roughage and enough liquids in your diet3) You could add as much fresh fruits in your diet, and more of carbohydrates which is good for your liver.If you observe the above, there might not be any need to go for artificial liver tonics along with so frequent investigations and you would do well overall.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I have read your question and understand your concerns. The treatment regimen prescribed to you is ideal in the treatment of asthma but the dosage may be adjusted and if you have no further episodes of asthma your doctor can gradually omit this inhaler and then you can use as an when required. Weigh gain is due to Fluticasone component which is a steroid. My advice to you is - 1. Ask your doctor to make least possible dose of Fluticasone component in your inhaler then you continue for 2-3 months with the same component twice or thrice weekly. Once you noticed no episodes occur during that period gradually that combination or simple Asthalin can be given as an when required. 2.As you are steroid dependent  now it will take time actually to taper the dose. 3.If you have seasonal asthma then you can start inhaler one month prior to season regularly. 4.Regular breathing exercise and yoga will help to reduce the incidence of acute attacks.

Just before and during your period, progesterone and estrogen levels decrease. In you these hormone changes may worsen asthma. The relationship between hormones and asthma is complex, varies between individuals and isn't fully understood.Asthma requires two type of medicinesOne is a controller or preventer, usually in the form of inhaled steroids and the other is a reliever which is a short acting beta 2 stimulant, as an inhalant. If the steroid inhaler is not enough to prevent attacks, then a long acting Beta agonist (LABA) is added.

Even a tiny amount of the allergy-causing food can trigger signs and symptoms.The most common food allergy signs and symptoms include:Tingling or itching in the mouthHives, itching or eczemaSwelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat or other parts of the bodyWheezing, nasal congestion or trouble breathingAbdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomitingDizziness, lightheadedness or faintingIn some people, a food allergy can trigger a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. This can cause life-threatening signs and symptoms, including:Constriction and tightening of airwaysA swollen throat or the sensation of a lump in your throat that makes it difficult to breatheShock with a severe drop in blood pressureRapid pulseDizziness, lightheadedness or loss of consciousness.This is a medical emergency and she should go to the nearest hospital if she gets an symptom suggestive of anaphylaxis.Food allergy should not be confused with food intolerance which is much more common and is a less serious condition that does not involve the immune system.In food intolerance one may be able to eat small amounts of problem foods without a reaction. By contrast, in  a true food allergy, even a tiny amount of food may trigger an allergic reaction.Because a food intolerance may involve some of the same signs and symptoms as a food allergy does like  nausea, vomiting, cramping and diarrhea , people may confuse the two.There are skin tests and blood tests to detect the foods your mother may be allergic to. A specialist in Internal Medicine or an allergy specialist will be able to arrange that.If you have further query, I am available.Best wishes for your mother's good health.Dr. Noble Zachariah"},{"Patient":"hi, my daughter is 6years old.we shifted to an area where every where construction is going on.so she started getting cough,blocked nose,sneezing and wheezing problem very frequently.we stay in Bangalore.she gets this problem earlier also when she was 3years old.she started getting wheeze problem but frequency was less.once in a year.recently one of a senior dr.gave her budecort mixed with saline 1:2 rato nebulization for 30 days as she was coughing while sleeping and after waking up in the morning.is it right way to give her nebulization mixing with saline..is it safe?can we use the same respule in the night after keeping it in refrigerator.dr.also gave her junior lanzol tablets for 30 days as she was complaining of stomach ache and not eating properly.vomitted 2 times in last 5days.sunday it started as we had outside food on Saturday.now she is fine no stomach ache complaining.i am giving her lanzol before food 2 times aday.for 30 days it is required.please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your daughter's history and would like to make suggestions for her as follows:1. I would agree that she might require regular medications (like Budecort) for at least 30 days as she used to have frequent symptoms.2. It is important that a child gets right dose of Budecort and the nebulizer chamber is filled with at least 4-5 ml of solution. The ratio between Budecort and saline is not important. Your doctor might have suggested you dilution to fulfill above two requirement. So I would suggest you to continue with the same dilution. 3. Ideally, one respule should be used only once. The reason is there chance of contamination and therefore infection is one uses cut open respule.One more problem with refrigeration is that inhaling cold solution may directly cause constriction of airways and may worsen symptoms. So I would suggest you not to give her nebulization immediately from refrigerator.4. Most practical solution is to use one full respule at one time and it is very much possible as they come in different dilution. Please contact your doctor regarding this concern and he will prescribe you respules with appropriate concentration.5. Some children with wheezing have symptoms worsening with what we call \\"gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). They need drugs like Lansoprazole (junior lanzol) for at least 4-6 weeks regularly.So if your doctor has prescribed her junior lanzol, I would suggest you to complete the course.6. Personally, I would suggest her allergy testing which will help you identify the substances causing allergies to her and also to know the measures to avoid them. 7. In general, please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible to her.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your daughter the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Iam 38 yrs/Fe 61 kg Family H/o Asthma suffering from chronic cough initially mild fever with yellwish sputum local Dr gave Augumentiin 625 mg bd and cough syp.cough persist with white sputum again started on Inj. amikacin250mg bd, Nacfil gold bd 3days.

First of all, I would like to know more about you like - a. Since when do you have repeated cough? b. Have you had wheezing or breathing difficulty? If yes, how frequently? c. Do you have nose symptoms of allergy - nose obstruction, sneezing, running nose, etc? d. Do you have headaches, facial heaviness, tickling in throat, etc? e.

Do you have symptoms like burning chest, nausea, feeling fluids in mouth, especially after a heavy/spicy meal?Above details would help me to know your complaints better. 2. Regarding diagnosis, I would like to mention here that PFT 340 only cannot diagnose or rule our asthma. PFT with post-bronchodilator response would be more helpful to know whether you have asthma. Chest X ray is always normal in asthma.3. I would also think possibility of sinusitis. Xray sinus is not the best investigation to diagnose sinusitis. CT scan of sinuses is considered a better investigation or sinusitis.4. I would also suggest you allergy testing for common air-borne allergens like house dust mites, indoor molds, regional pollens, insect proteins and pet danders (if you have pet). This will help to know whether you have allergies, also to identify the substances causing symptoms to you as well as to know the measures to avoid them.5. At present, I would agree with your current treatment. Should you have wheezing of breathing difficulty, I would suggest you to use salbutamol inhaler on an as-and-when-needed basis.6.

As your investigations like TLC, DC, ESR, Sputum, CT scan, Chest Xray are normal, I would suggest you spirometry with post-bronchodilator study. This will help to diagnose asthma.2. If you have symptoms like headaches, facial heaviness, constant tricking in throat, recurrent need to clear throat, etc, I would think of chronic sinusitis and would suggest you to consult an ENT surgeon who will examine nose from inside and also may suggest you CT scan of sinuses.3. If you have symptoms like burning in chest, nausea, feeling of fluid into mouth, especially after a heavy or spicy meal, I would think of GERD and suggest you an antacid for at least 4-6 weeks.4. If you are a smoker or you are exposed to passive smoke, it may be reason for your cough. Likewise, if you are exposed to air pollution significantly, it may be cause of your cough. I would suggest you to use personal protective measures like mask while exposed to smokes/air pollution.5.

First of all, it is important to know the cause of the sinusitis. Causes can be allergic or mechanical obstruction (like deviated septum of the nose, etc).2. I would suggest you to consult an ENT surgeon who will examine the nose from inside and may identify any such physical cause of sinusitis. He may suggest you investigations like CT scan of sinuses. He may also identify clues to other causes of sinusitis like allergies by examining the nose from inside.3. I usually suggest my such patients allergy testing which helps to identify the substances causing allergies.4. Intranasal corticosteroids, antihistamines like cetirizine, nasal decongestants, oral corticosteroids, etc are drugs other than antibiotics which are used to treat sinusitis. But these can be suggested only after thorough evaluation of your sinuses.5. Simple measures like regular steam inhalation and nose irrigation with saline are also very helpful.6.

What is the functioning of this medicine ??","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. If you have had such symptoms only first time, I would suggest you not to worry about asthma at present. In asthma, usually patients have frequent or constant symptoms of cough, breathlessness, chest tightness, etc which may improve and worsen over long periods.2. If you have such symptoms repeatedly or frequently or seasonal, I would suggest you an investigation called \\"spirometry with post-bronchodilator study\\" which is important to diagnose asthma. Usually pulmonologists and allergists perform such investigation.3. Deflazacort is an oral corticosteroid which controls inflammation (akin to \\"swelling\\" in common language) of the airways and thus improves breathlessness and other symptoms.

If I were your doctor, I would do a clinical examination of his abdomen to rule out an umbilical hernia which would cause such symptoms.

Asthma is a very broad diagnosis, it is not a single disease, it has many types. By knowing details about symptoms, it is only possible to judge (judgement vary from doctor to doctor) a diagnosis.2. Diagnosis of asthma can be reliably made by a test known as \\"spirometry with post-bronchodilator testing\\".

Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.As all the tests mentioned by you came out to be normal, if I were your doctor, I would advise you in addition an ultrasound of the abdomen to rule out chances of any endometrial deposits outside the uterus which might give you such discomfort during menses and urination. Also a urine culture and sensitivity report could be helpful in deciding on the appropriate antibiotics. The management of endometriosis (if positive) would need a consultation with a gynaecologist and so I would advise you to fix an appointment accordingly.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery.

I have tested the blood, urine, BP, thyroid  etc and everything came normal. Here the chest specialist has also conducted  the spirometry test which was normal. My p-flow is 400. My nose is always congested and when I use Nasivion spray I feel relief in my nose and my breathing difficultiy vanishes. One should not use a nasal spray for a long time but I am bound to use that one since the Inhaler prescribed by the chest specialist does not help me.

It is good that your spirometry is normal, I assume it was done with a \\"post-bronchodilator study\\". In that case, I would think your cause of feeling breathing difficulties may be nose obstruction.2. I would agree that decongestant sprays (which \\"open\\" a congested nose) should not be used for long time, they can cause rebound symptoms upon discontinuation.3. Were I treating you, I would prescribe you intranasal corticosteroids (mometasone or fluticasone) for at least 14 days. I would also prescribe you montelukast and levocetirizine for 28 days.4. I would suggest you to use an inhaler like salbutamol for breathing difficulty symptoms on as-and-when-needed basis only.5. Allergy testing for common air-borne allergens like house dust mites, indoor molds, regional pollens, insect proteins and pet danders (if you have pet) will be useful to identify the substances causing allergies to you as well as to know the measures to avoid them.Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which gradually improves allergy symptoms by working on immune system.6. Regular breathing exercises, physical activity and a healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals will also help you in a long run by improving your lung capacity and immunity respectively.7.

I would like to mention here that seroflo inhaler is a \\"controller\\" type of inhaler, it is not be used irregularly/intermittently.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.From the history of recurrent pain followed by formation of a lump on the lower right side of abdomen which is also painful points to the possibility of a undetected attack of appendicitis resulting in formation of an appendicular lump.

If I were your doctor, I would advise you for an ultrasound of whole abdomen to know the site of origin of the lump along with some investigations like CBC, serum HCG estimation for arriving at a diagnosis for appropriate planned management.

Regarding your main query, montelukast 10 mg is usually considered very safe for long term use. Common side effects are nausea or stomach upset.

However, salbutamol inhaler is a \\"rescue\\" type of inhaler, which should be used only for asthma symptoms like wheezing or shortness of breath.

Antihistamines can sometimes be associated with weight gain through changing certain chemical pathways in the brain.It is possible that this may be contributing to your weight.It may also be contributing to your dizziness.Singulair may be another option for you.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hello. i recently began taking sprintec birth control rounghly 2 weeks ago ive been on it for 15 days i started on a sunday start.

I'm not taking any medications but I am on birth control..the shot. If I sit or stand for a certain amount a time then it begins to hurt. The pain seems to be under my left rib cage. I'm not sure if there's something wrong with my back or stomach. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hi ! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, after an initial clinical assessment of your abdomen, I would advise you for an ultrasound of the abdomen with special reference to the pancreas to rule out inflammation in it which could give rise to such discomfort under the left rib cage. Also a routine CBC, a serum amylase and lipase would be helpful. In addition I would also advise you to avoid eating from outside to prevent any intestinal infection creeping in from outside unhygienic-ally prepared food. Avoidance of alcoholic beverages and smoking also top in your case if you do. A serum HCG might be indicated to rule out a pregnancy before going for an ultrasound. Till then you could go for an anti spasmodic and a proton pump inhibitor drug for a symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

(I've already had 3 benedryl's and rubbed on a benedryl gel over the rash, this didn't help)","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicIt is possible that you are being re exposed to the allergen and this is the reason that the allergic reaction is persisting.The correct treatment of allergies is the use of anti histamines as you are doing. If these are not effective then you may need a short course of oral steroids from your doctor.You may want to consider allergy testing to determine what you are allergic to and reduce your exposure.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Thank you for your kindness advise.My english quite is limit but I hope you can understand.My son 8 years old 22 kgs.He got nose allergies.He can't sleep at night for long term.He doesn't look like kids but sleepy all the time like an old man.He has ardenoid face.But someone suggest me to try probiotics but I also found probiotics cause some worm so how can I do?

I would agree with your treatment at present - regular Montek-LC and Seroflo inhaler.2. Regarding duration, as both the above medications \\"control\\" symptoms but do not treat the allergy itself. Hence one needs to take them as long as one experiences symptoms. Some patients with asthma may need to continue the medications lifelong.3. To diagnose and treat allergy itself, I would suggest you allergy testing, especially for house dust mites, insect proteins, indoor molds, common pollens and pet dander (if you have pets).This will help you identify the substances you may be allergic to as well as also to know the measures to avoid them.4. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to gradually improve allergy symptoms. Once beneficial effects of immunotherapy are clearly seen, your medicines could be tapered gradually under doctor's guidance.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I am having anaphylactic reactions appx once a week for the past few months now, have had diahrrea for 3 weeks, feel flu like, have bad body aches and extremely fatigued on a daily basis.

Persons with lng standing nose/sinus obstruction can develop problem in middle ears which ultimately can lead to balance/equilibrium disturbances like dizziness, vertigo, etc.2. Were I treating you, I would suggest you intranasal corticosteroids nasal spray (such as mometasone or fluticasone) for at least 4 weeks. Personally I would prefer intranasal corticosteroids over Astelin (which is an intranasal antihistamine) because antihistamines do not work much on obstruction.3. I would also suggest you regular steam inhalation and nasal saline irrigation. This will help relieve obstruction and will help \\"open up\\" sinus openings to drain sinuses. Please take care to avoid burns while steam inhalation.4. I would also suggest you to consult an ENT surgeon who will examine both your nose cavities and ear.

First of all, diagnosis of allergy is very important. Dust contains many types of particles and the first step is to identify the particular article from dust that causes troubles to you.2. For diagnosis, I would suggest you allergy testing for house dust mites, molds, common pollens in your region, insect proteins and animal dander (if you have contact with pets).This will help you identify the substances causing allergies and also to know the measures to avoid them.3. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy (\\"allergy vaccines\\") which works on immune system and gradually improves your immunity towards that particular substance/s.

Till investigations are done and immunotherapy becomes effective, I would suggest you regular intranasal corticosteroids for 14 days and combination of montelukast and fexofenadine thereafter.5.

Upper abdominal pain following ingestion of food points to a few conditions like a gastric ulcer, or a gall stone disease and a possibility of pancreatitis as few of the main offenders.

Montair LC is usually considered safe for long term use. Common side effects are sedation and stomach upset. So if you are not experiencing any of such side effects, I would suggest you could continue it for long duration.2. Most of the medications for allergies & asthma can only \\"control\\" symptoms but do not \\"cure\\" allergies. That's why one has to continue such medications for long time and symptoms may recur upon discontinuation.However, they are not basically habit forming. 3. For management of allergies, I would suggest you allergy testing for aero-allergens such as house dust mites, insect proteins, common indoor molds, common pollens in your region and pet dander (if you have contact with pets) which commonly cause asthma.This will help you identify the substances causing allergies to you as well as to know the measures to avoid them.4. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to gradually improve allergy symptoms over a long duration. Allergen specific immunotherapy is one of the definitive treatments for allergies.5. I would also suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution in general.6.

Regarding you father, in my opinion, regular montelukast+levocetirizine (Montair LC) may helpful to him also.

A recent CT showed that I have mucosal thickening with mucus present in the left maxillary sinus. The same thickening along the inferior aspect of the right sphenoid sinus. Plus partial opacification of bilateral ethmoid sinuses due to the mucosal thickening. Bilateral mastoid air cells are normally aerated. Do I have sinisitus? Is this the cause of my headaches?

Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make following suggestions for you:1. Yes, having headaches and mucosal thickening in sinuses, I would first think of sinusitis. Sinusitis is usually result of infection or log standing nose allerigies. Apart from nose symptoms, it can also cause headaches, post-nasal drip (feeling of mucous trickling into throat), recurrent throat clearing, etc.2. In patients with sinusitis with mucosal thickening, I usually suggest intranasal corticosteroids and combination of levocetirizine and montelukast for at least 14 days. 3. Regular steam inhalation twice a day and regular saline irrigation of nose cavity are a very useful simple remedies for long-standing sinusitis. It helps to drain the mucous from sinuses and recovery of mucosa. However, it has to continued at least for 14-28 days and please be cautious to avoid burns. 4. I always suggest my such patients to take plenty of warm fluids during the day and avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.5. I would also suggest you allergy testing to identify the allergy causing substances. 6. I would agree that it is not a serious condition but appropriate changes in diet, environment and life style can control it progressing. Sinusitis is a chronic condition and the more chronic it becomes, it can become difficult to treat and it requires longer treatments.

If yes, how frequently and how severe are they? Do you have any other allergies like nose allergies, food allergies, etc? At present, I would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. Regarding side effects of Aerocort, it contains two drugs - salbutamol & beclomethasone.Common side effects of salbutamol are tremors, feeling of heart beats, rapid heart beats, etc. Beclomethasone is a corticosteroid in inhaled form. Although it is safe as it directly acts in lung. Common side effects of inhaled form are throat irritation, local infection in throat, change in voice, etc. With long term use in high dose, it can cause side effects caused by other steroids - typical obesity, hypertension, diabetes, cataract, gastritis, etc.2. In my opinion, if you are not experiencing any of the side effects described above, it can be considered safe to use the inhaler for you.3. Were I treating you, I would suggest you allergy testing which will help you identify the substances causing symptoms to you and also to know how to avoid them.

Any medicine apart from allopathy - there are systems which offer treatment for allergic rhinitis such as ayurveda, homeopathy, chinese medicine, etc. It is best to contact the qualified persons from respected branches to know more about treatment in a particular system.2. Montek-LC is generally considered very safe from long term use. Common side effects are sedation, drowsiness, stomach upset. If you are not experiencing any of these side effects, you can continue it for long term use in my opinion.3. From allopathy, as an Allergist-Immunologist, I would suggest you allergy testing, especially for house dust mites, indoor molds, common pollens in your area, insect proteins, and pet dander (if you have pets).This will help you identify the substances that may be causing allergies to you as well as to know the measures to avoid them.4. Based on allergy testing report, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to improve allergy symptoms gradually over a long time.5. In general, I would suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution.6.

When symptoms start around 3-4 am, it usually means that the allergen (the allergy causing substance) is within bed/bedroom. It takes some time for our immune system to react to allergen hence when you inhale that particular particles while entering bed room, your nose starts reacting after some time. Although the allergic reaction starts within a few minutes, you get peak effect that disturbs you sufficient to wake up in night after several hours. 2. I usually suggest my such patients regular montelukast and levocetirizine or fexofenadine  before going to bed for minimum 2 weeks for symptoms relief.3. I would suggest you allergy testing for indoor allergens - house dust mites, insect proteins, indoor molds and pet dander (if you have pets).This will help you identify the substances causing allergies to you and also to know the measures to avoid them.4.

If you have such complaints repeatedly, I would think of asthma. If you have such symptoms for the first time, I would not think of asthma straightway.2. Were I treating you, I would add an antihistamine (like Benadryl) in your treatment, your current treatment does not have any antihistamine. So you can take a benadryl. However, Benadryl causes sedation, I would suggest you to take levocetirizine.3. Personally I would not suggest you dextromethorphan (a content in Robitussin DM) if you have wheezing. I would instead prescribe you salbutamol or levosalbutamol.4. Your doctor is the best judge to decide whether you need steroids (Prednisone). So, if you have been prescribed them, I would suggest you to take them as suggested by your doctor. 5-day course of prednisone is considered a \\"short course\\" and it does not require weaning off.5. As you have musuc ticking into throat, I would also think of acute or chronic sinusitis. Some of the above medications will help the sinusitis also, I would in addition suggest you to take plenty of warm fluids during day and regular steam inhalation which will help.6. If you have been having these symptoms repeatedly, I would think of allergies and asthma. In that case, I would add montelukast to above treatment. For long term management, I would suggest you allergy testing first, which will help you identify the substances causing symptoms to you and also to know the measures to avoid them.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health and a very good recovery.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"got some type of bite. have a dime size white (reg skin color) center with spreading purple- bruise like color circling it and getting larger.

Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.To rule out any chances of a pregnancy, if I were your doctor, I would advise you for a serum HCG estimation (as no contraceptive method is 100% fool proof, and a urine pregnancy test might give fallacious result) and if negative, would suggest you for a stool test for ova and cyst, followed possibly by an ultrasound of the abdomen to rule out any abdominal/pelvic organ pathology. In addition, I would also advise you to avoid any kind of food from outside to avoid any kind of intestinal infection creeping in and causing colitis. Depending on the result of physical finding of the abdomen, and related investigations, further management could be planned.

Thank you for writing to HCM. Your boyfriend seems to be presenting a pattern of fever that is typical in malarial infections. I would recommend that you have his blood tested for QBC malaria or a peripheral smear (whichever is available). The fever spikes when the parasites enter the blood and subsides when they hide inside an organ. Liver being tender is also suggestive of malaria (Liver function tests may be normal in early stages).Also since his WBC's are elevated it does indicate an infections. It would be useful to know the differentials such as if neutrophils are raised then it suggests a bacterial infection and in that case typhoid must be ruled out. If lymphocytes are elevated then it may be viral and dengue must be ruled out. Therefore it is my opinion that you have him evaluated for this fever of unknown origin by a physician for a detailed work up, blood tests and ultrasound of the liver or may be CT scan of the abdomen. Based on the results appropriate management may be indicated. Currently paracetamol to reduce fever is the only symptomatic option. Management for malaria, typhoid and dengue vary considerably.Hope this helps. Do let me know if you have any other questions."},{"Patient":"I started off with a bad cold about a month ago.

I have had a brief history of heart diagnostic starting a year ago. I had applied for a life insurance policy with SBI for which I was asked to get a health check up done at a reputed hospital in Mumbai. The cardiologist over there took my ECG and said that he cannot do a stress test as I was suffering from a heart disease 'cardiomyopathy' and he said 'my heart is growing in size and I will need a heart transplant 10-15 years later'. He asked me to get an angiogram done. But I thought I was hale and health and I ignored his suggestion to get an angio done. A few months later, I started getting some pain in the chest - sometimes burning, squeezing etc on the left part of the chest. It was not severe ever but mild pain. I went to a cardiologist (different one from the earlier one) and got an echo test and a stress test done. As per the reports, the echo test was normal while the stress test said \\"border line positive for ischemia\\". The doctor however said this is likely to be a false positive as there was baseline abormality in my ECG and asked me to come after 3 months if the pain persists. As it so happened, the pain continued to come on and off. In the meantime, my father was diagnosed with liver cancer and I shifted base to Bangalore. Since I was getting these pains, I wanted to get them checked thoroughly and went to a cardiologist in Bangalore. He saw the reports and said the same thing that it is likely to be false positive. He did an echo test and said it was very likely false positive. He also said that if the pain continues, he will recommend a stress myoview. Unfortunately my father passed away within three months of diagnosis and I moved back to Mumbai. I visited the doctor again as I started getting palpitations and the pain continued to come. He said that it must be due to stress and he continues to think it is false positive. He however said that for my own comfort, I should get a CT-angiography done. I have read fair bit on the internet about all these tests and heart diseasees. I have read about all the risks involved in each of the procedures that have been recommended to me so far. I am not able to make out which is the right procedure for me. I am allergic to pollen and get asthma while in Bangalore. In Mumbai I am quite stable. I use siroflo inhaler occasionally. Apart from this I dont have any other health problems. My BP usually is 130-140/80-85. heart rate ranges 75-95. My cholesterol levels are not that great HDL -31, LDL -142, triglycerides - 199. Let me explain you about my pain: 1. It comes at various ponts on the left chest 2. Sometimes it is a burning sensation, sometimes squeezing, sometimes pains the way a wound would pain 3. The pain is off and on - average 4-5 times a week and lasts for a few seconds 4. Sometimes when I exhale, I get a pain along a column inside the chest. Feels as if something is rubbing 5. It has never been severe; mild pain and I continue to do my daily work as usual 6. I dont remember getting any chest pain while excercising. 7. At times when it pains, I feel like moving my chest to avoid pain. Can you please help me with what can be the cause for my pain and which test should I go for to know whether I have any heart disease or if yes, what is it? I have been an athletic individual for a long time. In the last 8-10 weeks, I feel my heart is pounding very hard and I can feel my heart beat a lot. I can see the left part of my chest shakes rhythmically with the heart beat. Please do let me know if you need any other information regarding my problem. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows: (I will reply to you in a step-by-step manner)1. I should clarify that I should not suggest you any test for cardiac evaluation. These can be best suggested by cardiologists only. From your detailed workup, I can assume that at least two cardiologists believe that you are not having any significant heart disease at present. 2. I would like to know especially more about your allergies and asthma. This is because asthma can cause chest pains, an acute episode can cause even chest tightness. Not only that, an entity called \\"GERD\\" (gastroesophageal reflux disease) may be associated with asthma and it can cause burning type of chest pains.3. Hence, I would not interfere with your cardiac workup, but I would like to know - a. Since what age do you have asthma? What are the symptoms? What is the frequency of your symptoms? How you manage it? How was your asthma diagnosed?b. What are your nose/sinus symptoms? Do you have running nose, sneezing, nose obstruction, headache, facial heaviness, repeated throat clearing, etc? c. Do you have any symptoms like - regurgitation of sour fluids/foods after taking meals, especially after heavy/spicy meals or after lying down? Do you have sensation of nausea or vomit frequently?d. What are the medications that you frequently use or have used so far for allergies and asthma? What are any other medications that you use frequently/regularly?e. Is stress an important factor in your life?f. How is your digestion in general? DO you have repeated abdomen pains, constipation or diarrhoea?4. Above things are very important as - some of the asthma medications can cause palpitations, some of the asthma medications can worsen GERD. I would like to know whether you can correlate your symptoms with any particular drug/food intake.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"My mother is suffering from Asthma.

I was told that the residual on my clothing caused her asthma, is that true? Me and my daughter are very susceptible to upper respiratory infections.","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your child's history and would like to make following suggestions for you:1. I would like to know more about your daughter's symptoms - how many attacks of asthma she has had so far? What is her current age? Do you smoke otherwise, if not around your child or in home? How severe her asthma is? Did she require admission?Based on these details, I would be able to help you better.2. In fact childhood asthma is different from adult asthma. Asthma-like symptoms can be caused by repeated viral infections or some other conditions. Repeated infections can also be caused if one's immunity is poor.3. Regarding, residual on clothing causing asthma, sometimes such things may trigger a single or two asthma attacks, but I would not say only such things can cause asthma. Allergy testing and some other reports would be necessary in my view to make diagnosis.4. In general, I would suggest avoidance of all types of smokes, air pollution and dusts to both you and your daughter.Hope above information will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you and your daughter the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"past few months I ve been having problems with my lips swelling my tongue swelling on different occasions different things I ve eaten also I ve had situations where like half of my upper lip or half of my lower lip or even half of my tongue not even the whole thing what s well I ve been to an allergist they found nothing I went to a dentist they found nothing I just don t know what else to do thank you very much.","Doctor":"HelloThank You for contacting HCM.Such symptoms appear because of allergy to some specific thing.

Can a gp prescribe this ?","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and can understand your concern. I would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. Personally I do not suggest any of my adult patients to have a nebulizer at home. There are many reasons. a. Fist of all, there are many good inhaler portable devices are available (Metered dose inhalers, rotahalers, etc) which are very efficient, convenient and as good (sometimes even better) as nebulizer.b. Nebulizer has problems with maintenance, also requires electricity, also chance of cross-infections.In my opinion, nebulizers are good for young children and very old patients who cannot breath good by themselves.2. Were I treating you, I would suggest you regular montelukast and controller type of inhalers like inhaled corticosteroids for at least 3 months.3. I would also suggest you allergy testing which will help you identify the substances that you may be allergic to and to know the measures to avoid them.Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which slowly improves your immune system to improve allergy symptoms.4. In general, I would suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution.5. Personally I would suggest you daily breathing exercises, Yoga & Pranayama which gradually improves immunity and lung capacity.6. I would also suggest you a healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc) which are very important for overall health and immunity.

Usually patient respond at once , no need of any antibiotics . When complete relief ,stop the drug , if recurs start again.

Wheezing is a relatively common problem and usually it is not a serious one. If he gets repeated episodes of wheezing, he may be asthmatic, in that case consulting an allergist-immunologist will help him identifying what is causing him allergies and how to avoid. For wheezing, I would suggest him continue using inhaler, which controls wheezing.2. Regarding your concerns about baby, if your husband is allergic from childhood or he has hereditary allergies, the chances that your baby may also be allergic are approximately 40%. Of course, a few precautions should be taken during your pregnancy and early years of your baby to decrease the possibility. Basically, allergies are nothing but abnormal immunity.3. Regarding depression and fit, I would suggest you to seek professional advice from related specialists.4. I would like to emphasize here that stress is a common factor for all - asthma & allergies, depression & fits. So, please make sure that your husband adopts stress reduction strategies like regular exercise, healthy food habits & relaxation & meditation. You will also help him greatly by allowing him to express himself fully and thereby reducing his emotional stress.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your husband a very healthy life ahead.Thank you & regards."},{"Patient":"i have been having hives since march of 2010 i have seen 7 doctors 2 allergist 1 dermetologist a sinus doctor my gynecologist my primary doctor they have ran several test and can not figure out where my hives are coming from i have hives with angiodema i dont know who else to see they say maybe im 1% of the people they never find out where it comes from but i think there over looking something the only thing i have been told was that my iron was low and vitamin d but i think the vitamin d was low cause they had me taking steriods for a while This has really been hard to deal with i am a single parent with children and sometimes i cant work .","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and can understand your concern.I would like to make following suggestions for you:1.

I have taken this antibiotic in past also but never had this issue earlier. Shoudl I stop taking Azithromycin?","Doctor":"Hello,Azithromycin is a good and convenient antibiotic. It is not an antihistamine which is given for allergic conditions. The antibiotic is usually prescribed as a 3 day course of 500mg per day or a 5 day course of 250mg per day. If you are better , it means that the antibiotic is working. Mild diarrhea is a recognised side effect of antibiotics. If you were prescribed the 3 day course, it must be over now. If it is a 5 day course and if the diarrhea is not disturbing, you may continue with some symptomatic treatment for the diarrhea like black tea . If it is very bad then you have to stop and see how your sinusitis progresses. You may require another antibiotic if the fever recurs.Wish you a quick recovery.Dr. Noble Zachariah, Kuwait"},{"Patient":"i have allergies but i only sneeze. but i blow my nose some comes out but i still just cant breathe through my nose right! i feel like when i try to breather people can hear my a thousand feet away!! but i can breather just perfectly when i breather through my mouth!","Doctor":"HelloThank You for contacting HCM.This could be allergic cold.

Absolute eosinophil counts 450 indicate that the cause of your symptoms is allergy. It does not indicate to which substances you are allergic.Hence I would suggest you allergy testing, especially for house dust mite, common molds & pollens in your area, insect proteins and pet dander (if you have pets at home).This allergy testing will help you identify the substances you may be allergic to and also to know the measures to avoid them.Based on the allergy testing report, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which gradually improves your allergy symptoms by improving your immune system.2. I would also suggest you to take montelukast and levocetirizine for allergic nose symptoms. I would also suggest you to use salbutamol or levosalbutamol inhaler on as-and-when-needed basis for asthma attacks. 3. In genera, please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution.4.

Please try to observe whether they occur with particular clothes/particular type of clothes for example, woolen clothes.2. Were I treating you, I would suggest you to take an antihistamine like levocetirizine or fexofenadine for your symptoms.3. I would also suggest you to apply lotion like calamine over the itchy areas. Please don't scratch itchy areas as scratching can worsen itching.4. I would also suggest you to avoid wearing tight-fitting, woolen clothes. I usually suggest my such patients loose-fitting, cotton clothes.5. Please avoid activities causing excessive sweating and avoid too hot or too spicy food as they can worsen symptoms.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"My son is 16 years old. He has been dizzy for 2 weeks now. His hands also tremble on occasion and I have a couple of times in the past seen a twitch with his head. He hasn t attended school for 2 weeks. His doctor referred him to a neurologist, but I can t get in to see them for another week. He s taking an antibiotic in case anything is bacterial. He also gets allergy shots once a week. He is also using a prescribed nasal spray, zyrtec and mucinex. I don t know if this warrants a visit to the ER to get some definitive answers. We went to ENT about a year ago and nothing came of that. (Background: He was born at week 29 and has quite a history.) I m concerned.","Doctor":"hello, thanks for your query,dizziness could be due to eye( errors of refraction) cervical spine( spondylitis) ear( bppv, meniers disease, vestibular neuronitis). any fluctuations in  Bp, any fluctuation in blood sugar or electrolyte disturbances.kindly evaluate with blood tests, ent examination to rule out d cause, hope I have answered ur query, all d best, take care."},{"Patient":"I had a tummy tuck 8mths ago and had a quick and smooth recovery.

Is there anything I can do to stop these pains.","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query.Abominoplasty is an extensive operation and needs a large dissection, hence the internal scar also will be big and has varied course of recovery over the first 9 months and then settlement over the next period. Since you have got the Abdominaoplasty 8 months ago, the scarification might have caused you such a pain due to nerve entrapment or hernia at the incision lines. I would advise you to get this checked by the Surgeon , get ultrasonography of the abdomen and abdominal wall .. IF neurological pain, take medicines , if hernia get corrected by surgery."},{"Patient":"I am wondering if there could be any connection to the symptoms i've been feeling lately.

Common foods causing allergies are - milk, peanut, tree nuts, soy, wheat, rice, eggs, fish, shell fish. I would suggest you allergy testing for above foods and if positive, I would suggest you to avoid that particular foods.2. I would also suggest you to take a good multivitamin-multimineral supplement, especially vitamin D, E, zinc, selenium and probiotics like lactobacilli for at least 2-3 months.3. I would also suggest you to avoid packed foods, hotel foods and unhygienic foods. Homemade simple diet would be the best. Please take plenty of green leafy vegetables and fresh fruits, if possible. This will help your immune system and depression as well.4. I would also suggest you regular exercises like walking and jogging. 5.

Allergies to amoxicillin group of antibiotics (penicillins) are very common. Allergy testing for antibiotics is best done by skin testing which is done only at specialized allergy clinics. There are many allergy specialists and allergy clinics in Bangalore.2. Blood testing for allergy to antibiotics is not very reliable except for penicillin group of antibiotics. So even if you do the test for other antibiotics, it is possible that results may not be very reliable.  3. There are many other safe antibiotics apart from penicillin group. In my view, a doctor can prescribe you one of many other antibiotics available other than penicillins. 4.

After vaccination from past 2 days i am suffering from throat problems . heat boil in mouth n throat dryness . Is it allergy of vaccination or rabies symtoms. Please help me out . ASAP","Doctor":"Hi Priya. It seems that you have taken the vaccination on time and this will reduce your chances for developing rabies significantly. Also it is important to keep a watch on the dog that bit you for at least 10 days. If the dog survives for over 10 days then the dog probably doesn't have rabies and that would mean you wouldn't have it too. Rabies affects the nerves, so the dryness in the throat and heat boils are probably a reaction to your stress and the vaccinations. Rabies presents with muscular spasm, confusion, delirium and drooling of saliva due to painful swallowing. I do understand that this is a worrisome period for you, but I would encourage you to keep your hopes high and wait for a few days to see how your body behaves.

When I have used prednisone in the past, I usually was given lower doses and had to taper off. I am a bit concerned because of the high dose level and sudden stop at the end of five days. Thanks you...","Doctor":"Hi. Oral prednisone is very useful in allergies as it ceases the inflammatory response to the allergen almost instantaneously.It is necessary to taper steroids only if they have been taken for more than 14 days since that is the duration required by the body to start getting dependent on an external source of steroid (Hypothalamic pituitary axis). A 5 day course of steroid can be stopped abruptly without any foreseeable complications. Do keep in mind that high doses of prednisone may affect your vision so do see your physician who started you on these if you develop blurring of vision or changes in colour. High steroid doses may also make you vulnerable to infections so try to avoid anything that exposes you to a source of infection.A 5 day course of steroids is usually nothing to be concerned about.

When such patient visit I advise them to take montelukast+levoceterizine tablet once or twice in day according to severity of allergy and symptoms .Once relief , stop the drug , recurs , take . Steam inhalation and hot coffee also provide relief because they acts as bronchodilators .Hope this will help you."},{"Patient":"I was stung by a bee yesterday, actually I guess I stepped on it, but after I got the stinger out the pain was excruciating and later that night my toe swelled and went numb..

I live in Nassau County NY.  (Long Island)  I felt a sharp pain on my right calf just after spotting what looked like a spider as described above.  I soon after saw a raised bump and slight redness around the area.  The area now looks normal and the bump is regressing.  I have since felt one other twinge of pain in the spot similar to the initial bite.  I have washed it with soap and water and treated with peroxide twice.  (once before washing and once after)   My question is that I had a sneezing episode shorty after the bite but I was vacumming the rug this occured on to assure my child who saw this happen (my reaction) that I would make sure no more spiders were around.   Should I be worried about the sneezing?  What should I look out for.  Mostly the bite seems to be nothing but the sneezing concerned me.

It is dry, usually associated with a wheeze and comes in bouts of 5-7 coughs in sequences. It may be associated with some tickly sensation or itching at the back of your throat.In dry cough, due to the sheer force, it is quite common for some blood and mucus to come out along with some mucosal tissue. It doesn't appear that it came from within your lungs ( Coloured mucous like brown or green would be seen).The cough may have also been due to some amount of acid reflux to your voice box. This condition is called as LPRD. It is different from gasrtic acidity and does not have the sypmtoms of chest burning and stomach pain. It is the cough that raises abdominal pressure and causes the acid to reflux. The reflux then starts a cough and the cycle continues.You may benefit from an antiallergic medication and a good antacid for one or two weeks. However, you will need to have these findings confirmed by an ENT before the prescription of these medications.Do let me know if you have any further questions."},{"Patient":"I have allergic asthma for almost 20 years now.

First of all, with proper treatment including nebulization, asthma should improve and of course should not worsen. However, I would think of some causes why asthma may have worsened:a. Basically the episode of asthma may have progressed it self. It is a know fact that all the asthma medicines can only control symptoms, not \\"cure\\" it. So it is possible that due to progress of episode, medications may be not enough to control symptoms.b. Sometimes, nebulization with salbutamol/levosalbutamol, especially if given without oxygen, can cause paradoxical bronchospasm and can cause worsening of asthma symptoms.c. Sometimes, there may be problem with instrument or procedure of nebulization and it may be possible that your son is not actually receiving adequate amounts of desired drugs.Whatever the cause may be, I would suggest you to consult your doctor as it is unusual to have no response to proper nebulization in an asthma episode.Hope above information will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your son a very good recovery and the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"hi...my boyfreind catches throat infection after having oral with me..his tongue becomes red and faces problem in swallowing..he suffers from sore throat and cracks appear on tongue from which blood comes out...i am having no STI or STD..is he has allergy from my vaginal fluid and saliva??? is this a big problem..","Doctor":"hello,thanks for your query, vigorous , prolonged oral sex can cause cracking of tongue, he also gets sore throat due to microorganisms of vagina.both of you maintain hygiene like washing prior and post oral sex. tell him to do it slowly. hope i have answered your query. all the best. take care."},{"Patient":"I've been suffering from allergies for the past month: itchy eyes, ears, and a mild sore throat.

Ultrasonography will tell us whether there is thickened endometrium or retained products.The treatment may be medical to start with or you may need curettage as a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure."},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor, My name is Mr Aron, i am indian passport holder presently residing in China.

Most of the medications that you take for allergies, in your case, Duonase and Seroflo, can only \\"control\\" the symptoms, they do not \\"cure\\" the allergies unless you change your environment to reduce exposure to the substances to which you are allergic to.Hence, on stopping medications, your symptoms would return.3. Were I treating you, I would add montelukast and an antacid like pantoprazole to your treatment for at least 4-6 weeks.

As you have a long-standing problem, I usually prescribe my such patients intranasal corticosteroids (Mometasone furoate or Fluticasone propionate) for at least 2-4 weeks, montelukast and levocetirizine for at least 4-6 weeks.2. I also would suggest you to use inhaler salbutamol or levosalbutamol on as-and-when-needed basis for asthma symptoms or wheezing or breathing difficulties.3. It is important to mention here that all the medicines can usually \\"control\\" allergy/asthma symptoms, they cannot \\"cure\\" them.4. I would suggest you allergy testing which will help you identify the substances you may be allergic to and also to know the measures to avoid them.Based on the allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to gradually improve allergy symptoms over a long period.5. In general, I would suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution.6.

I have since (for 2 weeks) been back on it but am still suffering.  What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. In my opinion, inhalers such as Symbicort should not be stopped without doctor's advice. Stopping controller inhalers can cause return or exaggeration of symptoms.Please make sure that your technique of using inhaler is perfect and you are rinsing mouth after each use, this will reduce deposition of drug in throat and therefore throat irritation.2. In such patients, I usually suggest to continue original inhaler (Symbicort) in the same dose as they had been using previously.In addition, I would suggest them to use inhaler like levosalbutamol or salbutamol 3-6 times a day and also to take montelukast regularly.Please discuss these possibilities with your doctor.3. For long term management of persistent asthma, I would suggest you allergy testing, which will help you identify the substance causing symptoms to you as well as to know the measures to avoid them.Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allerge specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to gradually improve allergy symptoms over long time.4.

It's appreciable that you are even  noticing some minor changes happening inside you.  As for as exercise induced asthma ,  In exercise-induced asthma, the muscle bands around the airways are sensitive to these changes in temperature and humidity and react by contracting, which narrows the airway. Because people tend to breathe through their mouths when they exercise, they are inhaling colder and drier air.* The symptoms of exercise-induced asthma generally begin within 5 to 20 minutes after the start of exercise, or 5 to 10 minutes after brief exercise has stopped.- If you are experiencing any of these symptoms with exercise, inform your doctor.1. Coughing 2. Tightening of the chest 3. Wheezing 4. Unusual fatigue while exercising 5. Shortness of breath when exercising- As for treatment is concerned,  Bronchodilator medication, after consultation with your doctor inorder to rule out any other cause apart from exercise induced asthma. - Avoid strenuous exercise if it cause you uncomfortable.Hope that helped you."},{"Patient":"hello, whenever I am in the basement - I cough during the day, I know I do not have a cold.

Was on antibiotics for the better part of a year. This was done in England. The medical care there is much to be desired. They kept him waiting days and hours before any surgery was done; and then pulled seven teeth just to be sure that were not infected.

Later that night I was fine until I woke up this morning. I'm now countiueing itching like mad. Everywhere! So you know what could've caused it?","Doctor":"Hello Patient,Although you may never have encountered any allergic reaction after drinking Pepsi, it is possible that you may have developed a hypersensitivity to it now. Another factor is that something completely different (and unknown to you) must have induced the response. For e.g. dust, smoke, any strong fragrance or fumes, etc. The effect of the cream you applied will last for not more than 8 hours or till you wash your body. I would advise you to go in for Homeopathy because it will give you a long-lasting solution. In the mean time, you can apply Calamine lotion to soothe the irritation.All the best!"},{"Patient":"For the past few days I've had bad hunger like pains in the pit of my stomach to my chest.

High absolute eosinophil counts indicate long-standing allergy. 2. DEC helps another cause of high eosinophils such as tropical pulmonary eosinophilia but not allergy.3. Were I treating you, I would suggest you regular montelukast. I would also suggest salbutamol inhaler to be used on as-and-when-needed basis for wheezing.4. If your chest pain is not relieved by above treatment, I would prescribe you an antacid like omeprazole or pentoprazole.5. For long term treatment of allergy, I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who may perform allergy skin test and suggest you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to improve allergy symptoms gradually.6. In general, I would suggest you to void exposure to dusts, smokes & air pollution.7. Regular breathing exercises and a healthy nutrition will help you to improve your lung capacity and immunity respectively in a long run.Hope above suggestion will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"allergic reaction maybe? 27 female asthmatic current mess xopenex advair flonaseI think i maybe having an allergic reaction my symptoms started yesterday evening with a small itchy rash on my face and sides of my neck.tonight i have the itchy rash on my face and neck, a red raw painful rash on my lower abdomen, headache, wheezing I've taken benedryl but it doesn't seem to help much. should I go to the ER, or is there something else I could try?","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for your query.

Regarding your esophageal symptoms, personally I would suggest you to seek a gastroenterologist opinion and get upper GIscopy (endoscopy) done, if possible.2. If it is not possible, I would prescribe you a proton pump inhibitor drug (pentoprazole or omeprazole) for at least 4-6 weeks. If it improves your symptoms, you may need to take it for even longer time.3. Please try to correlate your allergy symptoms with your food intake. Common foods causing allergies are peanut, milk, soy, egg, wheat, tree nuts, fjsh & shell fish, some fruits & vegetables.Especially if you are getting symptoms within 1-2 hours of consumption of any food, it is highly likely that you may be allergic to that particular food.4. If some particular foods are suspected, allergy testing could be done to confirm.5. For symptoms of itchy patches (hives) and lip swelling (angioedema), Atarax (hydroxyzine) is appropriate in my opinion.6.

So, it can be used during an acute attack.3. Montelukast preparations- used as a maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of asthma.4.

Levosalbutamol inhaler is better and safer than Levolin-2 tablet in my opinion.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any other query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi.I m 23 yr old student.I stay in mumbai.I study in bangalore.In bangalore i got weezin problem wen i come back to my native place for vacations I dnt have any of this problem...i consult doctor he discover that I have asthma problem by checkin blood report and x-ray of my chest...he gave me esiflo inhaler...I would like to know this inhaler will cure my asthma and it is addicted?...and is there any side effects?..plz reply me as soon as possible...:(","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. Inhalers and most of the medicines do not \\"cure\\" asthma. They control symptoms of allergies & asthma.2. Depending upon your severity and frequency of symptoms, you may need \\"controller\\" type of inhaler such as Esiflo as your doctor has prescribed you. I would suggest you to take it regularly for at least 2-3 months and then continue/discontinue as per your doctor's guidance only.3. Inhalers do not cause addiction. It is a great myth. Only thing is that as asthma is a chronic disorder, its symptoms return on stopping inhaler. So patients feel they are \\"addicted\\". It's not an addiction, it's a requirement for the patient.4. Esiflo as two contents: Salmeterol and Fluticasone (inhaled corticosteroid). Side effects of salmeterol are tremors, increased heart beats, feeling of heart beats, ets. Side effects of Fluticasone are throat irritation, change in voice, throat infection with long term use etc.Above side effects can be minimized by proper technique of using inhaler, using a spacer device along with inhaler and rinsing mouth after use of inhaler.5. Were I treating you, I would add regular montelukast in your regular treatment. It will help allergy-asthma symptoms and will reduce your requirement of inhalers.6. I would also suggest you allergy testing which will help you identify the substance causing allergies-asthma to you and also to know measures to avoid them.Based on results, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to reduce allergy symptoms on long term basis.7. In general, I would suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.8. Regular breathing exercises & healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals (adequate green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc) will also help you in a long run by improving your lung capacity & immunity respectively.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

Were I treating her, I would suggest her daily montelukast and levocetirizine for at least 7-14 days.2. If she is old enough, I would suggest her regular steam inhalation which will help both sinus and ear symptoms.3. If she has repeated complaints, I would suggest her allergy testing which will help her identifying the substances she may be allergic to and also to know the measures to avoid them.4. If she has breathing problems/wheezing, I would suggest her to use salbutamol/levosalbutamol inhaler for symptom relief.5. In general, I would suggest her to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.6.

Once you stop the medications, there are chances that the symptoms may return, if they are due to allergy.2. I would like to specifically emphasize importance of technique of using inhaler. Please make sure that your technique is perfect, if it is not so, there are high chances that the drug may not reach your lungs and therefore seems ineffective.3. For allergy, I would suggest you allergy testing which will help you identify the substances you may be allergic to and also to know the measures to avoid exposure to them.Based on the reports of allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on your immune system and improves allergy symptoms over a long run.4.

I would agree with your doctor's advice of not giving her many antibiotics because - a. Most of the infections in children including bronchiolitis are viral (caused by virus) and antibiotics do not work on viruses.b. Unnecessary and frequent use of antibiotics affects immune system adversely and may increase allergies.c. Asthma is a disease relater to allergies and immune system, it is not caused by infections, hence unless there is a bacterial infection associated, a child with asthma does not require antibiotics.2. Were I treating her, I would suggest her allergy testing. Avoiding the substances she may be allergic to is the best strategy for allergies.3. For symptoms of asthma, she may require medications. I usually prescribe montelukast and levocetirizine for symptoms and salbutamol inhaler for breathing difficulties and wheezing.4. Please keep her away from dusts, smokes and air pollution.5.
