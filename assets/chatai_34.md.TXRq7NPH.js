Old age2. Diabetes. So get done ECG. If ECG is normal then no need to worry much for cardiac cause.You had gas problem which also favours GERD more in your case. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter.Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of chest pain and gas.So avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid stress and tension. Avoid large meals. Start proton pump inhibitor.

Since last week I ve been feeling spasms in my chest followed by a warm rush of blood sensation.

They reduced my heart rate with beta blockers but never addressed theses spasm sensations which are more disturbing to me than the fast pulse.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.Betablockers are known to cause bronchospasm.Beta receptors in bronchi are needed for bronchodilation, Especially beta 2 receptor.So whenever nonselective beta blockers are given, they will block the action of beta 2 mediated bronchodilation and cause bronchospasm.So better to start cardio selective betablocker (beta 1 selective). It Is having only beta 1 action and no action on beta 2 receptor in bronchi, So no bronchospasm. Beta 1 receptors are present in heart so beta 1 antagonist ( cardio selective beta blocker) will have effect only on heart.So consult your cardiologist and change to cardio selective beta blocker."},{"Patient":"Im 22, 5,9 , and Have GERD, and have extreme heart pain.

And these appear as scar lesion on chest x ray and CT thorax.Pulmonary contusion is common after rib fracture. So it is normal to have scar tissue on lungs at the site of broken rib.So due to healing, scar tissue is seen at the site of rib injury.No need to worry much for this. Follow up CT is needed after 6 months to see the status of the lesion.If scar is of same size than no need to worry.

Upper airway obstruction like enlarged tonsils, adenoids etc.So get done 2d echo to rule out congenital heart disease.Get done chest x ray and clinical examination of respiratory system to rule out asthma and pneumonia.Get done laryngoscopy to rule out upper respiratory tract obstruction.If all are normal than no need to worry much.But above mentioned causes must be rule out first."},{"Patient":"I experience chest pain and while i was i home felt pain rush up my jaw, teeth where hurting, felt uncomfortable, took a bayer pill, today i feel down, feel confuse, my head feels weird, so i took migraine pills, feel better now, but i was wondering if i should go to hospital.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.It seems mostly due to anxiety but better to rule out cardiac cause first.So get done ECG.If ECG is normal than no need to worry much for cardiac cause.Anxiety appears more in your case. And it also causes you migraine like symptoms too.So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution.You may require anxiolytic drugs too.So avoid stress and anxiety.Be relax and calm. You will be alright.

He wears compression socks to control swelling as he develops water retention and takes a fluid pill for this. Upon taking his socks off we discovered that his ankle was somewhat swollen, and just above this was a big red blotch area of skin that was very red and sore to walk on or touch. He s a very tall man and has been walking a lot in our home to get exercise, as he can t go out. He s had a couple of bad exacerbations in the last year, and his doctor said that he could have small damage to his heart. Should be contact his physician or a health professional asap? What can we do in the meantime until we can contact his Doctor....(it s Sunday, wouldn t you know). Thanks for any help.","Doctor":"Hi thereCOPD leads to increased Pulmonary vessel pressure which in turn will require the heart to function harder to help get enough blood into the lungs for oxygenation. The cardiac size in COPD patients are therefore usually enlarged as a compensation. Your husband is likely suffering from Congestive Cardiac Failure. His exercise should be done with a pulse monitor to make sure he is not over exerting himself. Other symptoms experience by CCF patients are PND(Paroxysmal norcturnal dyspnoea) where the patients wakes up at night for air, frequent urination and a decrease in the distance he is able to walk.Try propping his bed(Head side) up at night and having him raise his feet when he is not exercising. I would also revisit his medications and look at possible increasing the dosage of his diuretic(Fluid pill)"},{"Patient":"My mother has severe phelgm/mucus resultantly she feels problem in respiration.

She has been suffering for approximately a month and twice we have been to the professor level doctor in Pakistan besides mucosolvan syrup is not available in Pakistan.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist for your mother and get done1. Chest x ray2. PFT (pulmonary function test).3. CT thorax if needed.There are few possibilities in your mother's case.1. lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI)2. Chronic bronchitis.3. Pulmonary fibrosis.So get done chest x ray to rule out LRTI (pneumonia). PFT is needed to rule out chronic bronchitis.And CT thorax is needed to rule out pulmonary fibrosis if x ray is inconclusive.So I advice to consult pulmonologist and first diagnose her than start appropriate treatment.This will help her more, rather than giving haphazard treatment."},{"Patient":"Hi I'm not a heavy drink maybe 2 beers or a glass a wine a week been drink for 10 years.

Is it some alergy","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your problem and situation.Yes, it can be due to allergic bronchitis.You are still having symptoms inspire of treatment, this suggest need for pulmonologist consultation and proper diagnosis.So get done1. Chest x ray2. PFT (pulmonary function test).Chest x ray is needed to rule out lung infection.PFT is needed to diagnose bronchitis.You may need inhaled bronchodilators to cure cough.Along with this you may need antihistamines and antiallergic drugs too.So better to consult pulmonologist and get done diagnosis first and start appropriate treatment.

Infected person , by coughing and sneezing, discharges virus containing droplets in the environment.Healthy persons inhale these droplets and can develop similar kind of viral infection.So mostly at your work place, people are getting this viral infection through droplet infection by coughing and sneezing.So take your medicines regularly and wear mask so that droplet infection can be prevented."},{"Patient":"kinda embarrased here but friday night had sex with my wife was just nomal then got up saturday mourning and i coughed really hard and recieved a excruciating pain in my ribs on left side kinda where the bottom rib area .....since then if i couch or sneeze the pain is severe then subsides after a couple mins . is it possible i have cracked a rib from the cough? the pain isvery intense","Doctor":"Thanks for query. It is possible to get ribs fractured but it is rare. Left chest pain can be due to pleural inflammation, angina, musculoskeletal, gastric ulcers etc. I think you must get a chest xray done and an ECG done. Meanwhile can take antibiotic and analgesic.

He said that it gave a new meaning to coughing up a lung . It was stringy pink stuff with black chunks, is how he described it. We believe the black chunks may have been the black grapes that he had just before getting sick. Shouldn t he be feeling better by now (5 days in) or am I just being an impatient, worried mom?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query. 5 days antibiotic treatment if fair enough to get symptomatic benefit. In your case it may be possible to have infection with resistant organisms or something else. Get a sputum culture sensitivity, AFB testing done. Guided antibiotic therapy will help . till then supportive care with antipyretic, lot of fluids, cough syrups should continue.

It is not active lesion. You might be having tuberculosis or pneumonia in the past, which is healed after treatment and shows calcified lesion in left hilum.Since it is inactive disease, no treatment is required and it will remain as it is through out the life.

Not for 2 weeks.And recovery in tuberculosis is slow as treatment duration is for 6 months.You can expect recovery after 1 month of appropriate treatment.So I advice you to first confirm properly that you are having tuberculosis and you are receiving correct drugs in proper dose. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these.Better to get done Sputum AFB culture and sensitivity to rule out drug resistant TB in your case.So consult pulmonologist and start appropriate treatment."},{"Patient":"I am Sonia, 40 yrs old.

Most commonly affect smokers. But can be seen in hereditary, alpha 1 anti trypsin deficiency, recurrent lung infection, occupational exposure with fumes and dust or age related. Most common is tobacco smoking. It is irreversible disease. So cure is not possible. We can control the disease and prevent its progression by following treatment.1. Quit smoking as soon as possible. This is the most vital part in treatment.2. Start inhaled bronchodilators.3. Enroll in pulmonary rehabilitation center where chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercise are done.4.

I was a smoker but gave up on 3rd February 1993","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.Yes, you are right. Your current scar on chest x ray can be due to the procedure you had at the time of lung collapse.But better to get done 1. CT thorax. CT gives much better idea about lung lesion than chest x ray.2.

Pleurodesis will remove the potential space for pneumothorax because of adhesions. So recurrent pneumothorax can be avoided. This procedure is known as VATS (Video Assisted Thoracic Surgery). So consult pulmonologist and discuss about these.Vitamin b 6 deficiency can not cause pneumothorax. And vitamin b 6 is water soluble and easily available in day to day food.

So coughing and irritation with spasm occurred.So in your case , your symptoms are mostly due to foreign body.So urgent removal should be done through bronchoscope under direct vision.CT thorax is needed to know any infection is present or not due to foreign body.So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"I am 65 yrs. of age and both my cholesterol and triglycerides are elevated. Total cholesterol is 257. Triglycerides are 158. HDL cholesterol is 55. The dr. threw a sample of Crestor to me and gave me a prescription as well. I threw the Crestor in the trash. Started taking Cholestoff *Complete* which is for both dietary and genetic high cholesterol (made from plants) and am suppose to take two twice daily before meals. Also am eating 3/4 cup of Quaker Oat Meal w/ cinnamon sprinkled heavily over it each day and am on a low fat diet. Have been told that niacin also helps bring down cholesterol and am wondering if you would recommend taking it. I also take fish oil daily. Am interested in natural products for lowering it. Haven t been exercising appropriately and need to do that. Both of my parents had normal cholesterol levels but my grandmother passed due to a stroke. What is your recommendation and am I on the correct path? I am totally against statins due to their many side effects. I take medication for thyroid which is Synthroid and have no other major medical problems. Thank you very much","Doctor":"Hi, I respect your beliefs regarding the intake of natural products for lowering blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Despite statins as being the primary recommendation for lowering cholesterol levels and triglycerides, studies also support the use of fish oil, abeit slower than statins. They can still be used especially in those whom statins have caused side effects like body pains and liver enzyme elevations. And I agree with your current lifestyle of eating oatmeal, and I also suggest a Mediterranean style diet, together with fruits and vegetables. I would still recommend a consult with a doctor for checking other risk factors, as well as regular testing for your cholesterol levels. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards, Dr. Daryl Derick B.

So your lung lesions must be healed. In TB healing can occur by either of the following.1. Fibrosis2. Calcification3. Bronchiectesis4. Rarely complete resolution.Fibrosis is the common way of healing.

This made me assume it would be an ulcer and the doctor agree that a peptic ulcer is likely the culprit, however, without tests they can t confirm.

Can you give me an idea as to what may be causing the congestion?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you are having congestive heart failure (CCF) mostly because of following reasons.1. You are patient of PSVT (paroxysmal supra ventricular tachycardia).2. Your symptoms like breathlessness, congestion, coughing.3. Poor tread mill test.So better to consult cardiologist and get done 1. ECG2. 2d echo3. Coronary angiography.You might be having coronary artery disease too.This causes heart failure. So pumping of heart is reduced. So back pressure causes fluid accumulation in dependent part of body like lower limbs, abdomen and lungs. In lungs this will cause congestion and known as pulmonary edema.So better to rule out cardiac cause first for your symptoms.So consult cardiologist and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"When I was younger I was diagnosed with a heart murmer.

PFT (pulmonary function test)Since you are not improving with cough ,we need to rule out infection by chest x ray and worsening of bronchitis by PFT.PFT will also tell you about severity of the disease. And this will help in guiding treatment.Coughing raises intracranial pressure. So more coughing will cause more headache. So if we cure your coughing, headache will itself relieved.So consult pulmonologist and first diagnose yourself than start treatment accordingly.You may require inhaled bronchodilators and antihistamines."},{"Patient":"hi When taking Avelox for my upper respitory infection, & bronchitis, my heart beat, became so rapid I had to stop taking the Avelox .i have an inhaler for my COPD & take Claritin D Cefizil does not work for the chest cold symptoms only for my ear infections. What antibioitic would you recommend for me? Avelox did work when I was able to take it.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I advice you not to take antibiotics without culture and sensitivity report.COPD is chronic progressive lung disease. It actually decrease the lung immunity and defence. So recurrent respiratory infections are very common in COPD patients .So better to get done sputum culture to know which organism is causing infection and than get done sensitivity report to guide antibiotic therapy.Haphazard use of antibiotics will increase drug resistance, decrease quality of life and delay recovery.You should take adult respiratory vaccines like pneumpcoccal and influenza to prevent recurrent lung infection.So better to consult pulmonologist first and discuss all these, rather than taking antibiotics."},{"Patient":"My husband who is a veteran , has had a veteran Pulmonologist , (after giving him tests), determine his breathing difficulty (after left shoulder repair ) was due to an injury to the phrenic nerve during the surgery . His tests have shown that his left lung is paralyzed. What can be done? They say this can not be fixed. Help!. The quality of our lives has been dramatically reduced . FOREVER?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.Sorry to say but phrenic nerve once damaged can not repaired. Phrenic nerve supplies diaphragm. It is one of the strongest muscle for respiration.At the same time it is not the only muscle for respiration. You can make other respiratory muscles (other than diaphragm) more stronger by 1. Deep breathing exercise2. Chest physiotherapy3. Incentive spirometry.So by above things you can overcome diaphragm function by other respiratory muscles.These all will improve your lung functions and quality of life.You can record improvement in lung functions by regular PFT (pulmonary function test).So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"I keep having this pain in the center of my breast bone going to my back at first I thought it was my back but it is really painful when it hits and can last for an hour then leaves and ive been awaking with pain and was afaid to move from the pain in my chest I am female and im 44 years old","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion your central chest pain seems anxiety related mostly.But in menopausal age group it is always recommended to rule out cardiac cause for chest pain.So get done ECG to rule out heart problems.If ECG is normal than no need to worry much for cardiac cause.Anxiety related chest discomfort appears more.Menopause itself cause mood swings and anxiety.So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions. Try to identify stressor in life. And start working on it. You may require anxiolytic drugs. Better to avoid stress iand tension.

Almost 1 lakh per ml. This suggest significant UTI.So I advice you to get done urine culture and sensitivity to guide antibiotic therapy.You may need antibiotics for atleast 10-15 days Hygiene of private part is must.

My vision closed in from the outside of my line of site making a small circle resulting in complete vision loss for about 10-20 seconds.","Doctor":"Hi,It is Dr Sameer, cardiologist.You need immediate medical attention. Fast heart beat followed by loss of vision can be Atrial Fibrillation ( fast & irregular heart beat) which causes clot formation in heart. This clot can travel to any part of body including arteries of eyes & brain causing stroke or loss of vision.So go immediately to a hospital with both cardiology & ophthalmology setup for further evaluation & treatment.Hope you find this helpful.Wishing you good health.RegardsDr Sameer Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"yes, my son , who is severe to profound disabled and has an intractable seizure disorder has experienced a productive cough unlike what he has ever had. Considering everything he has always been very healthy. I May 2014 he had this cough and he went through bouts of being very active and then not-so-much. I took him to his doctor and was concerned about pneumonia, as he had that Dec 2nd 2012. The chest x-ray, an upright, was normal, but then June 7th 2014, he was very lethargic and it scared me and I took him to the ER and they did a semi upright chest x-ray and did blood work. I was basically left with the question, what do you want us to do, My response was, I wanted antibiotics, which they gave me. He took them for the 10 days and we went back to his doc and had another set of upright chest x-rays and confirmed a left upper lobe infiltrate and when compared to the one done in the ER and the previous one it confirmed that he had an infiltrate left upper lung. I saw it and being a retired ultrasound/x-ray tech I know how to read x-rays, etc. Another round of a more potent antibiotic and another set of x-rays 2 weeks later and still not cleared. Another 2 weeks without antibiotics and he is still not cleared. They are now looking at a pulmonologist for further study. My son also has a vagal nerve stimulator in his left upper section of his chest and it has been there since he was 8 or 9 and he is 21 1/2 years old. He is to have surgery to replace the battery and this can not be done until his lung is cleared. The device helps with his seizures. He is otherwise doing fine, healthy and active with no fever. He has has a lot of coughing in the beginning and now it is just slight and not every day. I do hear the sound of phlegm. He is disabled and can not talk. Thank-you for your advice This has been going on since May 2014","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem. Thanks for the detailed history.In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist and get done1. CT thorax2. Bronchoscopy and BAL (Bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis to rule out tuberculosis, fungal infection and other chronic infection.CT thorax is more better than chest x ray in diagnosis of pneumonia.BAL is more superior than sputum report in isolating causative organism.And upper zone chronic infection is commonly seen in tuberculosis.So better to consult pulmonologist and discuss all these.

I understand the many medications can cause a multitude of other health issues. About a week ago he developed a few sores with bloody crust on his face and a few little bump like things under his chin that look like a rash. We treated with antibiotic creams and tried a natural herbal antibiotic. While they don t appear to be getting worse they are not getting any better. we always thought when a suspicious site occurs and doesn t get better to obviously get it checked by a medical professional. My question is ... should we assume the worst case scenario skin cancer? Because one of his meds can cause skin cancer, or is it likely from, recently when they tweaked his meds?? With all he s been through, I am hoping your insight will lesson my worry. We have an dermatological appt in a week. perhaps we shud bump it up.... thank you for supporting my question.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.I don't think it is due to skin cancer.Lung transplant needs immunosuppressive therapy to prevent transplant organ rejection.These immunosuppressive drugs have a lot of side effects. And skin lesions are one of the common side effects of these drugs.So this can be the cause for his skin lesions.Another possibility is skin infection. Immunosuppressive drugs decrease overall immunity of patient. So patient is vulnerable for infections. So clinical examination of skin lesion is necessary to conclude the diagnosis. Better to consult dermatologist. You may require skin biopsy too. But it is too early to say skin cancer."},{"Patient":"yesterday i was in the move theater, and i inhaled to take a breath. and it felt like air went to my brain. it hurt a little bit then it was gone. it physically felt like a tube was going from my lungs to my brain then it stopped. it was just one breath. any idea what it was?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I don't think you are having any organic lung disease.The symptoms you are describing like feeling of tube going from lung to brain , is seen in hallucinations.

Bronchoscopy and BAL (Bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis if sputum is not availableIt is better to start antibiotics according to sensitivity report to achieve greatest effect and fasten recovery.So avoid rocephin injection further and consult pulmonologist and start treatment according to guidelines."},{"Patient":"As a pensioner I was given clarithromycin in place of biaxin because the dosage prescribed was 500mg and the pharmacy said the government does not cover pensioner for 500mg so they gave me the other drug at 250mg and double the prescription is this the correct thing to do to a senior will the other drug give the same effect on the pneumonia","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.No this is not the correct way to treat pneumonia in elder patients.Elders are at risk for severe pneumonia if not properly treated. So any pneumonia in old age should be treated cautiously and correctly according to guidelines.Ideal way to treat pneumonia is1. Identification of causative organism buy either sputum culture or bronchoscopy and BAL ( Bronchoalveolar lavage) Analysis.2. Once causative organism is isolated than find the antibiotics effective against it by sensitivity report.So better to consult pulmonologist and get done culture and sensitivity report. Than start antibiotics according to the sensitivity report.This will fasten the recovery, prevent unnecessary use of antibiotic and improve the outcome."},{"Patient":"my husband was diagnosed of PTB activity undetermined his Dr. from his pre-med told him to take 4 capsules of myrin p forte 30 min. before a meal everyday but after taking the capsules for almost 1 month we decided to check another dr. for radiologist and examined his x-rays told us that his ptb is stable and don t have to take treatment is there any possibilities that the 1 month of taking myrin p forte affects his body or triggered the PTB ?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.Any lung insult either tuberculosis or pneumonia or trauma after treatment show healing.And healing occur by any of the following mechanisms.1. Fibrosis.2. Calcification.3. Rarely complete resolution.Fibrosis and calcification are ore common and produce scar tissue which is visible on chest x ray.So your husband's previous x ray may showed old fibrotic lesion. In this scenario activity of lesion is determined by sputum examination for AFB. So for your current situation I advice you to consult pulmonologist and get done1. CT thorax2. Sputum examination for AFB3. Bronchoscopy and BAL (Bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis for TB.CT gives much better idea about fibrotic lesion than chest x ray.BAL is far superior than sputum in detecting AFB.If all are negative than no need to worry for tuberculosis. The lesions on chest x ray are just inactive scar."},{"Patient":"I would like to know if these medications that were given to me... for my horrible cough causes more cough... last night I didn t even sleep! Which one with the best for the cough? Azithromycin 250 mg dose pack, Benzonatate 100mg, MethyIPREDNISolone 4mg Proair HFA","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.Azithromycin is antibiotic and not cough suppressant.Benzonatate Is cough suppressant. But nowadays more effective and less sedative cough suppressant s are available in the market. Newer antihistamines are Very good cough suppressant.Methyl prednisolone is oral steroid and should not be given regularly unless strongly indicated.So better to consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (pulmonary function test) to rule out bronchitis. And also discuss about newer cough suppressant. Since these are prescribed drugs, you will need prescription for this."},{"Patient":"hello, the past few days my chest bone is sorejust left of center of chest. It also hurts when I breath and feels like I am pulling on the area. Kind of like being hit in the chest, and experiencing a feeling when I breath in as sore.

My name is Randy Acquistapace (479)250-5650.","Doctor":"Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.It looks mostly musculoskeletal pain. But we need to rule out cardiac cause first as you are having many risk factors like1. Age more than 502. High pulse rate (130-150)3. High cholesterol level.4. Left sided chest pain.So get done ECG and 2d echo to rule out cardiac cause. If both are normal than no need to worry much for cardiac cause.Musculoskeletal pain also cause rapid heart rate.So avoid heavyweight lifting, strenuous exercise. Avoid movements causing pain.Avoid bad postures in sleep.Take good painkiller and muscle relaxant.Apply warm water pad on affected site."},{"Patient":"I m currently having a weird feel mid chest. not pain but a heavy feeling and some air hunger like I can t fill up my lungs. last week my doctor did an emg and it was normal but ordered chest xray, stress test and echocardiogram which are scheduled for the end of the month. still having some shortness of breath some lightheadedness periodically. I m wondering if this is anxiety (already take Cymbalta) or something else?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.Your symptoms can be due to anxiety but it is still early to stamp anxiety as diagnosis, because your investigations to rule out cardiac and pulmonary causes are still left.Chest heaviness,lightheadedness,shortness of breath , all can be seen Cardiac causes like heart failure, coronary artery diseases etc and pulmonary causes like chronic bronchitis , pulmonary fibrosis etc.So get done chest x ray, PFT (pulmonary function test), 2d echo and stress test to rule out above causes.If all the above investigations are normal than anxiety can be the cause.So consult psychiatrist for diagnosis and treatment of anxiety.Avoid stress and tension. Be relax and calm."},{"Patient":"My 20yr old daughter has been diagnosed with right basal pneumonia, she also has asthma, she has almost completed a seven day course of 500mg (3xdaily) of Amoxycillan, she has had a 3 day course of prednisolone (6x5mg) and is now two days into on a second course of (same dosage as before). She is not really feeling any improvement in her symptoms and has been getting chest pain and dizziness in addition to her difficulty breathing since around the third day of her antibiotic course, this happens even at rest. She has had blood tests and chest X-ray at the hospital which diagnosed the pnenmonia and started her on antibiotics. She did not seem to have any crackles, but instead advised she had reduced air intake/breathing sounds on the lower right hand lobe. She has lost her appetite and has lost around 14 pounds in weight over the last two weeks. She gets chest pain (possibly heartburn?) after eating and when taking her antibiotic tablet. How long is it likely to be before she starts to recover? Is her illness contagious?","Doctor":"Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist and get done sputum culture and sensitivity report to guide antibiotic therapy. And no need for prednisolone (steroid). As steroid actually lowers the immunity and flare up the infection. So unless strongly indicated steroids are contraindicated in pneumonia.So your daughter needs identification of causative organism and directed antibiotic therapy. If sputum is not available than  bronchoscopy and BAL (Bronchoalveolar Lavage) analysis is needed to isolate organism.Since she is not improving with current treatment, stop steroid and consult pulmonologist for proper diagnosis and treatment."},{"Patient":"Since morning after getting up from the bed and till now I am having like sinking heart problem and seems like I am very tired and sometimes I have to take a deep breath....I took my breakfast, did shopping and made dinner and took dinner but the feeling is same through out the day.......what is that and how could I be normal?

I have had chest xrays and an MRI of my chest in the past 6 months that showed nothing of concern. Any thoughts on what could be going on, and is it normal to have a problem in one lung and not the other without it being cancer?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you are having viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and due to this worsening of underlying bronchitis and asthma.Viral infection is known risk factor for worsening of underlying asthma/bronchitis.So better to consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT is needed to diagnose asthma and bronchitis.It also tells about severity. And treatment is depending on severity only.So you may require inhaled bronchodilators and antihistamines.So your coughing is mostly due to uncontrolled asthma/bronchitis. Better to consult pulmonologist and start treatment accordingly."},{"Patient":"For a few years now, Ive been having these pains in my chest. They re about in the middle of my sternum or in my lower left ribs. It s a kind of sudden, pinching feeling that makes it difficult to breath.

I am an 18 year old female, already diagnosed with PTSD.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.In my opinion it is PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) related chest pain only. But better to rule out cardiac cause first. So get done ECG first to rule out cardiac cause. If ECG is normal than no need to worry for cardiac cause.PTSD can also lead to GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this ,acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the central chest pain.So avoid stress and anxiety. Be relax and calm. Take proton pump inhibitor for GERD. Consult psychiatrist for proper treatment of PTSD. You will be alright. Don't worry much."},{"Patient":"hey i am a female, age 22 and every morning when i wake up or during my sleep i have a severe chest pain right in the center of my breast.i don t smoke nor drink nor lift heavy weights. currently am on birth control for like almost a year now and 2 months ago is when this chest pain started. my question is what may be the cause of my severe chest pain during the nights and when i m awake?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.There are few possibilities in your case.1. GERD ( Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease)2. Stress and anxiety related ( mood disorder)Birth control pills can cause GERD and mood swings (anxiety). And you are taking it since 1 year. So chances of side effects Are high. And GERD and anxiety are very well known side effects of birth control pills.So better to consult gynecologist and discuss about these side effects.At present take good proton pump inhibitor and avoid stress and anxiety.You are too young for cardiac disease. So possibility of cardiac cause is very less.Side effects of birth control pills appears more in your case."},{"Patient":"i have bronchiectasis and cough a lot but do not bring any mucus up. just lately i have felt in the evening i have been coughing more and have a feeling of liquid creeping up my chest that will not go and coughing last for many hours.please any suggestions - help!","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Bronchiectesis is chronic ,structural disease of lung causing dilated bronchi.In this dilated bronchi, secretions tend to accumulate and cause infection and inflammation. These in turn cause more coughing and difficulty in breathing So treatment of bronchiectesis is antibiotic, mucolytics , cough expectorant and inhaled bronchodilators.Better to consult pulmonologist and get done chest x ray to rule out infection.Newer mucolytics and expectorant are N Acetyl Cystiene (NAC), ambroxol and bromhexine.

You may not have chronic bronchitis but acute bronchitis can be there. So get done PFT (pulmonary function test) to rule out acute bronchitis. And for thick mucus you need mucolytic and expectorant.Commonly used drugs for this are1. N Acetyl Cystiene (NAC)2. Ambroxol3. BromhexineAll will dilute the mucus and loosen it so that it can be easily expectorate.Chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercise bis also beneficial in your case.So better to consult pulmonologist and discuss all these"},{"Patient":"I can only walk short distances and then I become very short winded.

He has severe copd. He has been using a cpap at night but they are going to put him on a bipap. Will this help him get rid of his bad oxygene or carbon dioxide YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hello dear, thanks for your on HCM.CPAP means continuous positive airway pressure. In this mode a constant positive pressure is generated throughout the respiration (inspiration as well as expiration). So for expiration will be difficult for patient As he has to expire forcefully against the positive pressure.So expiration will not be completed and therefore carbon dioxide level is rising in body.In BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) we can adjust positive pressure in both inspiration as well as expiration. So inspiration pressure can be set high to improve oxygenation and expiration pressure can be set low to decrease carbon dioxide level.So Bipap will be more beneficial to him than CPAP.Also ask him to enroll in pulmonary rehabilitation program for chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercise. This will help in COPD symptoms."},{"Patient":"Continual microplasm pnumonia symptoms. Almost 2 years now. Sputum always comes back with negative report. I know better.

As foracort contain s inhaled steroid. This is much better and less injurious than oral prednisolone.And it has no effect on relieving chest congestion. So better not to take oral prednisolone.Instead of these start following things to relieve chest congestion.1. Steam inhalation.2. Nebulization of mucolytic drug (ambroxol)3.

I am an 18 year old female and for as long as I can remember I have had a sharp pain in my right flank when I sneeze. It feels like a fish hook gets caught in my side.

The pain occurs right over a very think and jagged portion of my scar. Is this why it happens?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I don't think it is because of your previous scar.I think you should get done chest x ray to rule out pleurisy (inflammation of pleura). As pain on coughing,sneezing,deep breathing is the characteristic feature of pleurisy.The common causes for pleurisy are1. Pneumonia2. Pleural effusion.3. Tuberculosis.So better to get done chest x ray to rule out all these.If x ray is normal then your pain might be due to pulled back muscle because of sneezing.So apply warm water pad on affected site and take muscle relaxant."},{"Patient":"I had an angioplasty with two stents in the left anterior decending coronary artery 4 days ago, and tonight I developed a persistent cough and had to get out of bed.

Can you please confirm, is there any other way to find out the blockage other than angiogram??","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.Blockage in the coronaries can be diagnosed by1. CT coronary angiography. (Less invasive)2. Percutaneous coronary angiography (PCA). (More invasive,but investigation of choice to rule out blockage).So by these two methods you can know coronary blockages.I advice you to go for PCA. Because in this,accurate diagnosis of blockage is done. And if blockage is detected then therapeutic measures like, stenting,ballooning etc can be done in the same setting.So better to go for PCA."},{"Patient":"I caught a cold or allergy the other day now it is in my chest.

Chest x ray2. PFT (pulmonary function test).Uncontrolled disease can be due to untreated or recurrent infection. So chest x ray is needed to rule out infection.PFT is needed to know the severity of the disease. And treatment is based on severity only.Along with inhalers I think you should follow these things too for better symptomatic relief.1. Enroll in pulmonary rehabilitation center where chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercise are done.2. Get done adult pulmonary vaccination with pneumpcoccal and influenza to prevent future infection.So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these"},{"Patient":"I was diagnosed with zenkers diverticulosis years ago.

By reading your complaints it seems like u are a case of symptomatic, Zenkers diverticulosis. It often causes clinical manifestations such as difficulty swallowing, sense of a lump in the neck, reappearance of ingested food in the mouth, cough, smelly breath and involuntary gurgling noises when swallowing. If it is small and asymptomatic, no treatment is necessary. Larger, symptomatic cases of Zenker's diverticulum have been treated in the past by neck surgery to resect the diverticulum. The currently preferred treatment is endoscopic stapling and fibreoptic diverticular repair. You should consult ENT specialist.

Its not painful, it just feels like a pressure down my left side. Its uncomfortable to lay on my left side because it feels like my side is caving in. Same with laying on my right side. Also hurts when i lay on my stomach. The only time it doesnt hurt is when i lay on my back. what could this be?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.In my opinion you are having gaseous distension of stomach mostly, which gives you bubble feeling in left chest.But as a rule in left sided chest pain, we need to rule out cardiac cause first.So get done ECG to rule out cardiac cause.If its normal then no need to worry much.It is gaseous distension mostly.This can be due to GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease). So avoid stress and anxiety.Avoid hot and spicy food.Avoid large meals.Take proton pump inhibitor.You will be alright."},{"Patient":"I am 46 year old female, have been having shortness of breath, difficulty breathing and my left elbow was hurting a little bit. Went to hospital, blood work, chest x-ray and ekg were done, nothing showed up but an elevated d-dimer (1.0). The doctor ordered a cat scan with dye to rule out a clot/tumor, showed nothing. I have not been feeling well at all. What could this be?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.I think you should consult pulmonologist and get done 1. PFT (pulmonary function test)2. CT pulmonary angiography.Bronchitis can cause breathlessness. So PFT is needed to rule out bronchitis.D dimer is high in your case. So possibility of Pulmonary embolism is there. So pulmonary angiography is needed to rule out embolism.Consult pulmonologist and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"I tested in gulf medical test hospital in India, the result is your chest xray shows in one small white patch. this is TB so fitness certificate not issued that report shown in my family doctor he said this northing for TB this is only cold affected this true ? please advice.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.I advice you to consult pulmonologist and get done1. CT thorax2. Bronchoscopy and BAL (Broncho alveolar lavage) analysis.In your case we need to rule out activity of the lesion,whether you are having active tuberculosis or not.Your white patch may be due to old fibrotic scar.Or may be due to active tuberculosis.So CT is needed as it gives great diagnostic value over chest x ray.BAL is also much better then sputum examination.So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"I got punched in the upper right hand side of my chest, basically in the pec area. Now it hurts every time I cough or doing certain movements. This was during a self defence class. The instructors was demonstrating with bare knuckles. I think he got over excited. Should I be worried or will it go away?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you are having blunt chest trauma due to punch.And the cause for your chest pain is musculoskeletal only.But blunt chest trauma can cause following complications.1. Rib fracture.2. Pulmonary contusions3. Pneumothorax4. Muscular injury.So get done chest x ray to rule out all these.If chest x ray is normal then no need to worry much.You are having muscular pain only. Try to follow these steps.1. Avoid heavyweight lifting2. Avoid strenuous exercise.3. Avoid movement causing pain.4. Take good pain killer and muscle relaxant.5. Apply warm water pad on affected site."},{"Patient":"I have a curiosity question. I just had a CT scan and was told I have nodules in my lungs. Is there an easy explanation as to what that means? I just had PE s in both lungs which are now dissolved. No mention of nodules were made prior to the current CT. WOndering what causes them. t","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Since you had pulmonary embolism with new developing nodules on CT thorax, we need to rule out following possibilities.1. Connective tissue diseases (CTD)2. Malignancy3. Tuberculosis4. Sarcoidosis.So better to consult pulmonologist and get done bronchoscopy and BAL (Bronchoalveolar Lavage) analysis to rule out above mentioned causes.If everything is normal then get done repeat scan after 6 months to see whether nodules are increasing, static or decreasing in size."},{"Patient":"ok the other day, I was walking down the hallway and stopped in front of my locker. All of a sudden, I felt sharp pains from left side of my chest to the beginning of my side. The pains happened 2 seconds in between. I was just curious what it may be.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Sudden left sided chest pain on walking (exertion) is mostly seen in cardiac cause.So I advice you to consult cardiologist and get done 1. ECG2. 2D Echo3. Troponin I level in blood.4. Coronary Angiography if something is found in above tests.So better to consult cardiologist and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"My chest hurts or my heart I can t tell. I ve had EKGs done and X-rays and those came back normal . Mostly feels like a discomfort as if something is trying to push my heart out of my chest. At first it would last only a feel seconds now it s lasting longer.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Since your cardiac and pulmonary causes are ruled out by normal ECG and chest x ray, I advice you some blood investigation s to rule out your chest discomfort.1. CBC (complete blood count)2. Thyroid levels.Anaemia and hyperthyroidism can cause similar complaints.So CBC is needed to rule out anemia.Thyroid levels are needed to rule out hyperthyroidism.If both are normal then mostly your symptoms are due to anxiety.So avoid stress and tension. Be relax and calm."},{"Patient":"When I am sitting I get chest pains. When I am standing and doing work, there is No chest pains. I have to drive alot and every time I drive I get terrible chest pains. I saw a cardiologist and my angioplastic and my echo cardiogram were fine. The chest x ray was good also. Why is my chest hurting me when I sit down only and not when standing or moving around? Tighting pain.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion I think you are having muscular pain mostly, as cardiac cause has been ruled out.Another thing which supports the muscular pain is positional pain (only in sitting posture).So your sitting posture causes some of the muscle s to pull or work more. This causes pain in your case.So try to follow these things.1. Proper sitting position is required.2. Seat in back support chair only. Avoid too much bending on either side .3. Take good pain killer and muscle relaxant.4. Apply warm water pad on affected site.You will be alright. No need to worry much."},{"Patient":"I am 64 and quite healthy, not overweight.

If deficit then supplement should be started.If B 12 is normal then mostly you have anxiety related needle pricking pain.So avoid stress and anxiety."},{"Patient":"i have been useing inhaled steroids past 6 months ......i have been using esiflo 500 and budamate 400 every 12 hours....reading the side effects i want to gradually tap down the medication . my question is : 1 .can i tap down he medication gradually if so , hw ? 2.can i take steroids only during attacks , juz like normal asthalin","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to see status of bronchitis. If the report is good then you should taper down esiflo first.Continue with budamate.And again get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). If improvement is seen then taper budamate.And don't worry about side effect of inhaler. They are very safe.

I m pretty healthy, and run 5K a day, but is this something I should take action now and manage it? Or can it be managed?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you should not worry much. As your CT Thorax report suggestive of old fibrotic scar in lung and pleural thickening.Both are indicators of old disease process which has been healed. So they are not suggestive of active disease.So no need to worry much.This can be due to old tuberculosis or pneumonia.And these lesions will remain throughout the life. And no treatment is needed because they are inactive and not harmful.So nothing to manage in your case."},{"Patient":"Hello.good afternoon.

I don t know what it could be; fluid?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I don't think it is fluid.In my opinion you are having bronchitis. Mostly due to viral infection.Viral infection is very common in cold weather. Actually cold environment helps virus to grow and spread.So in winters viral infections are more common. Your symptoms like difficulty in breathing, not getting enough air can be seen in bronchitis.So better to consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to diagnose bronchitis."},{"Patient":"I was diagnosed with bronchiectasis 11 years ago.

And coughing of blood (hemoptysis) can be seen in all.Similarly alcohol damage liver and stomach. Can cause gastric ulcer and cirrhosis. And vomiting of blood (hemetemesis) can be seen in both.So better to consult doctor and get done1. Chest x ray2. Ultrasound examination of abdomen3. Upper GI Scopy.And quit smoking and alcohol as soon as possible. Both are not good for health. They will only harm you."},{"Patient":"This morning I woke with a feel in my chest like my heart was just broken. Throughout the day it traveled down to my stomach.

And for dinner I had some bread with a slice of pizza. What does this mean??","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you should not worry much for cardiac cause.But its always better to get done ECG first to rule out cardiac cause in such symptoms.So get done ECG. If this is normal then no need to worry much.You may have GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease).It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up and cause the symptoms. So the hardened feeling with food can be due to this.So avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food.

A short course of benzodiazepine will help, but only if no respiratory pathology is found.you can discus my opinion with your treating doctor.thank you.Regards,Dr Pankaj Borade"},{"Patient":"Iget nigglin pains in my chest in the middle and throughot my chest only at night and in.the mornings it feels.like.pressure and light stinging mainly on the left side it feels.like it sits there and then.eases.away I m very active play sport 24/7 but I eat a lot.I over eat and eat cheesemelts?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you are having GERD ( Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease ) mostly. But better to rule out cardiac cause first. So get done ECG. If this is normal than no need to worry much. It is due to GERD only. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms. Try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 3. Avoid stress and anxiety. 4.

Since your ECG and stress test is normal with controlled  blood pressure , I don't think you are having any cardiac cause for your chest pain.

Having had flutters and pounding before, i didn't panic because i knew that it would pass. i did notice it was different,jumping fast all over my chest area, also i felt like i was going to pass out.then the feeling went into my neck and in my stomach,like pumping then i had slight pain under my jaw and under cheekbone area.Started to feel bit heavy on my chest but no chest pain. fainting feeling went away and i carried on as normal. A week later was sitting down,my heart felt little bit the same and like i was going to pass out.Only mild and not as long as before.About a week later went to see nurse about something else,didn't mention it, she took blood pressure, said it was fine.left, walked to shops, was there looking about 10minutes and my heart started jumping all over again but i was more concentrating on not passing out,just trying to get my breath back.somebody came to help me.Since then, i can constantly feel my heart doing something different.I'm not sure if its stopping or jumping? Even my husband can feel it in my pulse in my neck,he said its like a pause. it also seems to make me cough and when it does a double jump it seems to jolt me?","Doctor":"kind of description you're giving, its look like you are having tachycardia episodes (high pulse rate) most probably the condition called as psvt. best treatment is electrophysiological studies which will confirm the diagnosis and can be treated with ablation simultaneously and mostly permanently. if not try to get ecg done if possible during the episodes or try measure pulse rate or heart rate and treatment try cough multiple time which will stop this tachycardia. You can also pour cold water over your face or try to blow out air through closed nostril and mouth, which will make high pulse rate subside."},{"Patient":"Hi my mother is 48 years old known hypertensive diagnosed with allergic asthama around 10 years back but now aggrevated with pasage of time productive cough especially at night time she took salnon and flixotide inhalers but her cough do not subsided n in morning it is severe she also took tab deltacortil 2 months back her routine lab test are normal n chest xray is also normal what should I do for episodes of productive cough.....","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Since your mother is hypertensive and asthmatic,  there are two possibilities for night time coughing in her case.1. Acute left Ventricular failure (LVF)2. Asthma exacerbation. So get done 2D Echo to know her left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ( LVEF). If it is low than this is the cause for her symptoms. If this is normal than get done PFT ( Pulmonary Function Test ). If worsening Obstructive defect on PFT, than possibility of asthma exacerbation is more.So consult your doctor and discuss these possibilities with him.Also discuss about starting anti allergic plus antihistamine combination in night. It will give her more relief."},{"Patient":"My wife age 72 diagnosed with copd has a rapid heart rate of over 120 with low blood pressure of 106/63.

In my opinion you should immediately consult pulmonologist and hoapitalise her as she is having tachycardia,  low oxygen level and hypotension. All suggest worsening of underlying COPD.The most common cause for this is infection. So we need to rule out this first. Chest x ray is needed for this.She needs low dose oxygen,  intravenous fluids,bronchodilators, antibiotic and steroids too.So better to consult pulmonologist and start treatment as soon as possible."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have a pain under the lower part of my left ribs, it started yesterday and felt like a knot at first and now it is just a pain not severe but constant.

I can understand your situation and problem. I advice you to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. CT THORAX2. Bronchoscopy and BAL analysis. We need to identify the causative organism and sensitive drugs so that antibiotics can be directed.CT gives excellent imaging of lung parenchyma and thus improvement or worsening of previous pneumonia bout can be diagnosed. BAL is very sensitive for identification of organism. So antibiotics can be guided.So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"My mother 90 yrs old was hospitilzed on Friday April 25 2014 AND HAD BEEN RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL on April 29th in the evening.

That is why proper control of hypertension, as well as screening for diabetes for control, will help prevent early onset of kidney disease. In general, a target blood pressure of less than 120/80 is optimal and would lower the risk of kidney disease due to hypertension. I recommend frequent consults with your private doctor for appropriate medications and dose adjustment. A particular anti-hypertensive medication is good for preventing kidney disease, a group of medications called ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Hope I have answered your query.

In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist and get done1. CT THORAX2. Bronchoscopy and BAL ( Broncho Alveolar Lavage ) analysis3. PFT ( Pulmonary Function Test ). Pneumonia can happen in both lungs but it is not common.I think we need to rule out interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) and chronic congestion first.

I would like to know more about your symptoms like whether you have recurring nose allergies, nose obstruction, sinus symptoms, stress, etc.From your given history, I would think of 3 possibilities:a. It may be obstructive sleep apnea, usually due to nose obstruction due to allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, etc or some other obstruction in upper respiratory airway. In that case, I would suggest you to get examined by a ENT specialist who will examine your nose from inside and may identify the cause.b. It may be gastroesophageal reflux causing choking at night. As you have acidity, this is also a possible cause. In that case, I would suggest you to take an antacid like ranitidine daily before meals for at least 4 weeks.c. It may be night terrors, especially if stress is a problem for you. In that case, relaxation and consulting a psychologist may help you.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"39 yr old female, very healthy, vegetarian, exercise regular, 124 lbs, 5 8 .

CBC ( Complete Blood Count ) if show high WBC count than possibility of infection is high.2. Chest x ray. If this shows consolidation or infiltration then it is due to pneumonia only.3. If chest x ray is inconclusive then get done CT THORAX. 4. Sputum routine examination and sputum culture for isolation of causative bacteria. 5.

And we need to treat it promptly as it will cause hypotension and bradycardia. We first need to identify the extent of emboli.So get done CT PULMONARY ANGIOGRAPHY.

If the lung function turns out to be negative then i would suggest you go ahead and do a post exercise spirometry whereby we will know whether u have exercise induced asthma.As far as anterior hernia goes that needs to be operated as early as possible to avoid any complications."},{"Patient":"Hi I actually do have a question or two...I was diagnosed last year with a polinary embolism and since december of last year I haven t been able to make an appointment with a doctor so here are my questions...can a person with an embolism who drinks alcohol kinda delay the effects of a embolism and another question is how long can I live with the embolism?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should stop alcohol.As alcohol will have detrimental effect on pulmonary embolism.  It will actually worsens the prognosis. So person who is drinking alcohol will have less effect of drugs and thus worsen the condition. And the prognosis of pulmonary embolism is depends on size of it and involved areas. So if larger arteries are involved than prognosis is not good.But usually five year survival rate is more than 70-80% if regular medication and follow up visuts are done.So no need to worry much. Prognosis is good."},{"Patient":"I did a lot of yard work this morning. Its hot in Arkansas. I came in the house I ve stayed hydrated. I spoke on the phone for some time lying on my Right side.

I was freaked cause I thought the numbness might be signalling an imminent heart attack. Is this serious? Should I stop smoking weed?","Doctor":"definitely this occurs due chemicals present in the weed.  it tend to stimulate heart and peripheral vasoconstriction leading decrease blood supply to hands leading to tingling sensation. Also it increases blood pressure.Smoking also lead heart problems and attack so on priority smoking should be stopped."},{"Patient":"I recently went to the emergency room for Chest pain and I fainted briefly but after several heart test nothing found .

By your description I think you are having isolated mediastinal lymphnode.In old age (your age group) causes for this are1. Benign enlargement2. Infection3. Calcification due to old age4. Rarely malignancy (lymphoma) etc.So in my opinion you should not worry much. As single lymphnode is benign mostly.But better to get done repeat CT scan after 6-7 months.If lymphnode is decreasing or static than it is benign. And if increase in size than you need to consult pulmonologist and get done bronchoscopic ultrasound guided biopsy of the lymphnode."},{"Patient":"My sister has just been diagnosed with microbacteria infection in her lungs with an abscess.

He is also having problems with the heart palpitations. He is not short of breath and blood pressure is normal. We recently went to a cardiologist and he is now wearing a holt monitor for 48 hours and then an echocardiogram scheduled for the 19th. My question is could the rib being out of place in the upper chest cause this problem of the heart issues??","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I don't think improper rib attachment in upper chest cause palpitations in heart. It will cause pain but not palpitations. Palpitation can be due to arrhythmia, thyroid diseases,  anemia or stress and anxiety. So to rule out arrhythmia holter monitoring (24hour continuous recording of ECG) and 2D Echo is necessary. If both of these are normal than get done1. CBC ( Complete Blood Count ) to rule out anemia. 2. Thyroid function test to rule out thyroid diseases. If these are also normal then it must be stress and anxiety related. So ask him to avoid stress and tension.

It does seem to be worse after eating or having a scotch and cola.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you are having GERD ( Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease ) only. As your pain is getting worse by eating and drinking scotch  or cola.It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms. Try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 3. Avoid stress and anxiety. 4. Start proton pump inhibitor. 5. Go for walk after meals. 6. Keep 2 - 3 pillows under head in the bed. 7. Avoid smoking and alcohol. 8. Loose weight if you are obese .Since your cardiac work up is normal, I don't think of any other cause. It is GERD mostly."},{"Patient":"Hello, I am a male 29 years old.

In my opinion you are having upper Respiratory tract infection ( URTI ) at present.  You are having throat discomfort which also suggest URTI. So better to start these treatment. 1. Drink plenty of fluids. Keep yourself hydrated. 2. Avoid oily and spicy food. 3. Warm water gargles 5 - 6 times a day. 4. Start macrolide group of antibiotic. 5. Take antihistamine and anti inflammatory drugs. Once this episode is over, get done vaccination for influenza and pneumococcal to prevent future infection.Get done PFT ( Pulmonary Function Test ).

The rehab said she is running a fever of 101 which was just brought down with Tylenol. She was treated in hospital for fluid around left lung and still awaiting results of thoracentisis fluid sample. The first draw was negative but they are doing a second. The doctors don t know if she has a magligancy or if she just has an infection. My question is - could an atypical pneumonia cause fluid around only one lung and possible be cured with antibiotics? I don t know why they kept saying it probably isn t pneumonia but a malignancy. Sorry for the long question.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. But pleural effusion (fluid around lung) in old age (age more than 55) patients, are having diagnostic problem due to possibility of malignancy. The common causes for pleural effusion in old age are1. Tuberculosis2. Bacterial infection3. Malignancy4. Cardiac causeSince you are saying that antibiotics are not working to reduce effusion,  possibility of tuberculosis ,malignancy  and atypical bacterial infection is more.And yes, infection can cause unilateral effusion.

Ideally we should rule out cardiac cause first for your chest pain.  But you don't have an option for ER visit, ECG can not be possible. I think it is GERD ( Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease ).  It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms. Try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 3. Avoid stress and anxiety. 4. Start proton pump inhibitor. 5. Go for walk after meals. 6. Keep 2 - 3 pillows under head in the bed. 7. Avoid smoking and alcohol if you have this habit. 8. Loose weight if you are obese ."},{"Patient":"Hi. I am 28 weeks pregnant and I woke up last night with sharp pains in the lower left side of my chest.

As pregnancy can be a risk factor for this. And pleural effusion causes pleurisy ( inflammation of pleura ), this is the reason for pain during coughing, sneezing and deep breathing. So possibility of pleurisy is high.Since you are pregnant,  chest x ray is not recommended.  So get done ultrasound examination of thorax to rule out pleural effusion.

Start montelukast levocetirizine combination once at night with steam inhalation three times daily and continue inhalers"},{"Patient":"I have chest pleuritic chest pain in right side, on X ray & Scan certain amount of fluid identified as infected what is non tap able, doctors using Antibiotics. What are the possible way to determine the type infection in this case. Still pain is there while lying dawn on bed for some time after taking a course of antibiotics.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Ideally we need to drain the fluid and ger done culture of the fluid to know the type of infection. But since it is not tappable,  we need to rule out type of infection by other tests like1. Sputum routine microscopy and culture.2. Bronchoscopy and BAL ( Broncho Alveolar Lavage)analysis.3. Blood reports like ESR, CRP and PCT. Amongst these PCT is highly specific for bacterial infection. And most common cause for pleural effusion is bacterial infection only. So discuss about these tests with your treating doctor."},{"Patient":"I have periodic upper left chest pains that are not severe and they go away on there own. The pain sometimes has a burning sensation and minor pressure. They may not return for hours , days, or weeks. Less often I will get a temporary pain on the side of my neck. Might I have some blockage or heart issues?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should first rule out cardiac cause.  As chronic , dull aching pain can be due to angina also.So get done ECG and 2D Echo to rule out cardiac cause. If both are normal than no need to worry much for cardiac cause. You may have GERD ( Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease ). As it can cause burning and pressure too.It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms. Try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 3. Avoid stress and anxiety. 4. Start proton pump inhibitor. 5. Go for walk after meals. 6. Keep 2 - 3 pillows under head in the bed. 7. Avoid smoking and alcohol if you have this habit. 8. Loose weight if you are obese ."},{"Patient":"I have mitochtondrial disorder, prone to high lactic acid, weakness, unbalance, went deaf. Lately I feel like I have the flu all the time. Fall asleep during the day, am forgetting things, night headaches. Just generally feel sick. Are things getting worse. Shortness of breathe. Trembling.. Am I having respiratory problems. ?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Mitochondrial disorders can affect all organs of the body. And it is genetic disease. So not possible to cure completely in older age.In new borns if detected we can go for gene therapy.  But in adults the results of gene therapy are not encouraging. So better to start symptomatic treatment.Start multivitamins and protien supplements. Take vaccine for pneumococcal and influenza to prevent future lung infections. Get done CT THORAX  and PFT ( PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST ) to diagnose restrictive lung disease as a cause for your breathlessness. As restrictive lung disease are common in mitochondrial disorders."},{"Patient":"My husband has COPD and last week had a heart ablation after 7 days in hospital with pneumonia. He is on cumaden and has anose bleed that has lasted 1 1/2 hr..Tried head forward, pinched nostril etc. Can t use his oxygen because of it. What should we try next?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Coumadin is an oral anticoagulant and it is vitamin K antagonist. Since your husband is on coumadin and having nasal bleed, I advice you to immediately consult doctor as he needs vitamin K injection. He also needs nasal packing done by ENT specialist. He needs hemostatic agents like tranexemic acid. All these can be done in hospital only. So better to take him to the hospital and start vitamin K injection."},{"Patient":"i have a twitching fluttering thing going on for about 2 hours now in my lower left peck i can see it moving also a slight pain and tightness in that area have had pains there befor but usually go away quick i just quit smoking in the last week after 15 years thanks","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Since you are having left sided discomfort,  I think we should rule out cardiac cause first.Twitching and fluttering in chest is caused most commonly by palpitation (rapid heart rate). And this palpitations can be due to arrhythmia. So get done 1. ECG2.  2D Echo3.  Holter monitoring (24 hour continuous recording of ECG).If all these are normal than no need to worry for cardiac cause. Then this can be due to apprehension and anxiety as you left smoking. So better to avoid stress and tension. Keep calm.Consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions."},{"Patient":"I had a shoulder xray which was normal, but it was noted that There is mild fibronadular change in the lateral left mid to upper lung zone. Correlation with current and/or prior chest radiographs is advised to begin further evaluation. I am 54 years old. When I was 22 years old I had pleurisy several times, which was quite painful and rather debilitating. When I saw a pulmonary specialist, he said he thought he would be seeing a much older patient, as there was scarring on my lungs similar to that of a TB patient. My maternal grandfather lived with TB for many years and live a block away, so I spent a lot of time with him. He eventually died from TB when I was 5 years old. Could I have possibly contracted some latent form of the disease which subsequentally went away on its own? I also had bacterial pneumonia for which I was hospitalized for about 3 weeks when I was around age 5 or 6 as well. My question is where should I go from here...","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Any lung insult whether infection, injury or trauma can cause healing. And healing in lung is seen as1. Fibrosis2. Calcification3. Rarely complete resolution. So in my opinion you are having healed lesion of old pneumonia. But at present we need to rule out its activity.So consult pulmonologist and get done1. CT THORAX2. BRONCHOSCOPY AND BAL ( Broncho Alveolar Lavage ) analysis for TB. As CT is much better than chest x ray for parenchymal lesion.And BAL analysis is far better than sputum in determining TB. If both are negative than no need for anti TB drugs.

I can stand to lose 75 pounds or so and I am 5 7 inches tall. Can you give me a clue?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Since you are diabetic and not taking treatment,  your diabetes must be out of control and very high.And uncontrolled diabetes is a risk factor for heart disease like hypertension,  angina, heart failure,  coronary artery disease etc.Other risk factors along with diabetes are1. Old age (age more than 55)2. Post menopausal status.So get done ECG and 2D Echo to rule out cardiac cause. Uncontrolled diabetes can also affect lungs.So get done chest x ray and PFT ( PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST ) to rule out pulmonary causes. So consult doctor and discuss all these and get control over diabetes."},{"Patient":"I m 56 year old not overweight woman who just had a session with pain in the middle of my chest and it caused profuse sweating and dizziness.

The way you describe your symptoms like chest pain,  sweating,  dizziness,  feeling of passing away, point towards cardiac cause more.And risk factors for cardiac cause in your case are1. Age more than 552. Post menopausal status. (CardioProtective effect of estrogen is gone in this age).So better to rule out cardiac cause first. Get done1. ECG2. 2D Echo. Possibility of heart attack is more with such symptoms.

I read that it could be signs of asthma but I ve never been diagnosed with it. But I do spend a total of 9 hours or more 5 days a week moving and running around.","Doctor":"Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you are having allergic bronchitis. Coughing and itching are characteristics for allergic disease (process).Since you are having symptoms mostly at night, you may be allergic to your night clothes or bed sheet or pillow covers etc. And these act as allergen and cause symptoms. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done PFT ( Pulmonary Function Test ) to diagnose bronchitis. Change your bed sheet,  pillow cover and night clothes. Start using new cotton ones.Also take antihistamine drug. You will mostly be alright by these changes."},{"Patient":"Please sir ,am having.

Also i am not face any kind pain in chest. Is it symptoms of TB? kindly help me please.....","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Paracardiac consolidation on right side can be due to1. Bacterial pneumonia2. TB3. Aspiration pneumonia. So we need to find out the causative organism for proper diagnosis and treatment. So get done sputum examination for TB and culture to find out bacteria other than TB bacilli.If sputum production is not there than get done Bronchoscopy and BAL ( Broncho Alveolar Lavage ) analysis. So your right paracardiac consolidation can be due to tuberculosis or other bacterial infection.  Chances of tuberculosis is less in your case.So better to consult pulmonologist and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"i have been suffering on and off for 3 months a terrible ggging cough !! it feels like water running down right side of throat !! i have had a nasal spray anti acid tabs and i am now on antibiotics !!! i am still concerned it could be more serious ???","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should first consult pulmonologist and get done1. Chest x ray2. PFT ( Pulmonary Function Test ). Chronic cough not responding to antibiotics can be due to bronchitis. So we need to rule out this first. And PFT is needed not only to diagnose but also for knowing severity of bronchitis.  And treatment is based on severity only. So PFT is necessary. Another possibility is chronic lung infection like TB or fungal infection.

I am a 33 year old female.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should first quit smoking. As smokers are at great risk for recurrent pneumothorax irrespective of air travel. Air travel causes significant pressure changes and possibility of development of pneumothorax is high. And this will be even more if patient is smoker. Normally patient can do air travel after 6-7 weeks of pneumothorax. So you can definitely travel in plane after 11 weeks. But better to quit smoking first. This will increase chance of recurrence of pneumothorax."},{"Patient":"When I woke up this morning my lungs felt heavy like I had just finished running a marathon.

In my opinion you had intubation with endotracheal tube for general anaesthesia during surgery. So the thing you felt in throat must be endotracheal tube.And COPD patients tend to show retention of carbon dioxide (CO2 narcosis) during general anaesthesia as they can not exhale it.So increased CO2 in the bidy can depress central nervous system. This high CO2 along with general anaesthesia lead to stoppage of breathing ."},{"Patient":"Hi I had suffered Dengue Shock Syndrome a year back and fully recovered.

So plz discuss  this with your physician  he will examine  you for local tenderness  and smasm   .and if found he will prescribe you medicine  for this..hope this will help."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor. Im 25. I have been feeling weak and i feel i have no energy to do anything. I had chest pain and i felt i could not fill myself up enough with oxygen. My throat feels blocked the whole time.

My doctor did all blood tests and are all normal except my kolesterol is a bit high . I dont know what to do else. Can you give me an idea of what it might be please? Thank you","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Since your all reports are normal, I think your chest pain is mostly related to GERD only. GERD is chronic disease. You need lifestyle modifications along with drugs for complete control of symptoms. So try to follow these steps along with proton pump inhibitor. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 3. Avoid stress and anxiety. 4. Go for walk after meals. 5. Keep 2 - 3 pillows under head in the bed. 6.

Cardiac causes like heart failure, ischemic heart disease etc.2. Pulmonary causes like COPD ( Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ) , fibrosis, etc.So get done ECG and 2D Echo to rule out cardiac cause. Get done chest x ray and PFT ( PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST ) to rule out pulmonary causes. So consult doctor and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"hi docs!i am Saugat from Nepal.My father is of 53 yrs.From last 3 yrs he has been suffering from high rate palpation about 120 per minute.My father does have Br. asthma too.He has visited many doctors but none of them and none of their medicine can cure palpation.At beginning of this,my father first consulted a local doctor and he prescribed medicine like Lorel 1 mg & Inderal 10mg for 2 yrs.But it didnt suit so my father left it and consulted Dr.Raut,one of the top heart specialist of country.Then he priscribed medicine like Dilcontin 90 mg & Calaptin 120 mg but this two medicine lead to high rate pulpation,extreme chest burn,back burn,dizziness,aasthma.etc.So after 3 month of their use doctor told to leave it and began to use Zapiz 0.5 mg from last 4 month and still continuing.But my father's high pulpation has not been cure yet.The trend is continuing.Now my father is getting harrased and me too..please!!i request u to tell me what to do to cure this high pulpation?????","Doctor":"first do u have any ecg report. is it showing any abnormalities.what I can suggest, first get one thyroid test done.secondly is he inhaler on regular basis if yes then one content in inhaler is salbutamol or formoterol or levosalbutamol, this content causes palpitations tremors and other complaints. so you asked your physician to remove this content from inhaler.or sometimes if bronchial asthma is not controlled then it causes low oxygen level in blood and palpitations."},{"Patient":"im 36 had surgery for pectus excavatum when i was around 5 yrs old. i am verry short winded. im concerned about my heart and lungs, i get worn out very fast. i cant even keep up with my children. i cant play with them and have to make excuses because i get winded so fast. i push my self to keep up, but im afraid my heart is gonna exploid. will my heart last?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. By your history I think you are having uncorrected pectus excavatum. It Is a kind of rib cage anomaly. With age this anomaly can cause restrictive lung disease. In this lungs are restricted to expand due to rib cage anomaly. So lungs become weak and it further damage heart.So right sided heart failure with cor pulmonale and pulmonary hypertension can be seen in these patients. Better to consult pulmonologist and get done PFT ( Pulmonary Function Test ) and 2D Echo to rule out all these. Start chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercise."},{"Patient":"Having extreme pressure & discomfort in my chest. My heart is pounding away in my throat feels tight.

He wanted a echocardiogram done so I had that yesterday. Before we got home the heart dr. called the house so I called him this morning. He said the pressure is high in my heart and wants me to get a heart cathiterisation done. He wanted me there today for it but I didn t have anyone to drive me home. What is the cause of high pressure in the heart and what could happen if I just let it go?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you are having congestive cardiac failure ( CCF ). Uncontrolled hypertension can cause CCF. And the most common cause for CCF is coronary artery disease.  So when patient is diagnosed with CCF on 2D Echo, we need to rule out coronary artery disease first. And to rule out coronary artery disease,  cardiac catheterisation and angiography is must. And if blocks are detected than coronary intervention should be done. So don't let it be as it is. Consult cardiologist and get done angiography and start treatment accordingly."},{"Patient":"I am a 46 year old female, 140 lbs. healthy.

So possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more. Pancreatitis pain is usually  constant and more in the back.So try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in muscular pain. 1. Avoid heavy weight lifting and strenuous exercise. 2. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 3. Avoid movements causing pain.4. Take good painkiller and muscle relaxant. 5. Apply warm water pad on affected site."},{"Patient":"I have been getting air bubbles in my upper chest causing lots of pain, I take alka salsa and that helps me burp, but this has been happening a lot for the past 3 days and I never had this problem in my life, what is going on, it causes my chest to be very painful.","Doctor":"Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you are having GERD ( Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease ).  As burping and gaseous feeling is seen in GERD.  It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms. Try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 3. Avoid stress and anxiety. 4. Start proton pump inhibitor. 5. Go for walk after meals. 6. Keep 2 - 3 pillows under head in the bed."},{"Patient":"i just got may x ray result awhile ago and the impression is PTB, right. the Chest PA says minimal infiltrates seen at the right upper lobe.. Heart, great vessels, diaphragm, sulci and bony thorax are unremarkable. what should be the best treatment i could have? thanks","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Upper zone infiltrate on chest x ray is seen most commonly in tuberculosis. So get done sputum examination for AFB to confirm tuberculosis. Treatment of tuberculosis consists of two phases. 1. Intensive Phase2. Continuation phase.In intensive phase four drugs are given. Rifampicin 450 mg,  Isoniazid 300 mg, Pyrazinamide 1250 mg and Etambutol 800 mg. All 4 drugs are given for two months.

Ovarian cancer is very notorious for spread in pleura and peritoneal cavity.So recurrent pleural fluid and Ascites can be due to metastatic spread.So get done pleural fluid cytology and pleural biopsy to rule out metastatic involvement. Another possibility is low protien and low Hemoglobin. So get done serum protien level and CBC ( COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT) to rule out this. But possibility of malignant cause is more.  So get done pleural fluid cytology and pleural biopsy."},{"Patient":"I am a smoker, well I have quit as of today due to fear. I had a chest x-Ray and MRI back in July for an anterior discetomy.

And your telling me 4 mos later. His response was due to the report I am really not at all concerned and planned on talking to you about this at your next check-up . In his next breath he said I am going to send you for a CT scan anyhow. I asked him again if he thought I have lung cancer and he said No, I am quite confident it is nothing to worry about and I will see you in 2 weeks to go over the results of your CT scan and put your mind at ease.

In my opinion you are having bronchitis due to lower respiratory tract infection ( LRTI ). Infection is the most common cause for attack or worsening of bronchitis. And your other symptoms like bodyaches and tiredness etc are also due to infection. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done1. Chest x ray2. PFT ( Pulmonary Function Test ).

First a bronchoscopy was performed and I was told my lung was too inflamed to take a biopsy. 2 days later a needle biopsy was performed, but I still do not understand the results. I am still having chest pain and don t follow up with my pulmonary doc for weeks. I m hoping someone can help me better understand the findings which I have copied and are as follows: Sections show an acute lung injury pattern with reactive type 2 cells. They are associated with acute and chronic inflammatory cells infiltrating including some eosinophils, and as well as neutrophils, some of which are in alveolar walls and raise the possibility of so-called capillaritis. In addition, there is some airspace fibrin and very focal organizing pneumonia(it is thought to be the dominant pattern). It is hard to know what these findings might mean. I think infection is certainly a differential. I did note that the BAL also grew candida, and although this really does look very much like Candida pneumonia, I would still do at least a GMS stain on the tissue. The differential also includes aspiration, although I do not see definitive foreign material. The presence of an acute lung injury pattern with areas suspicious for capillaritis, also raises the possibility of this to be a manifestation of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (wegener s granulomatosis), or at least likely another vasculitic process. A GMS stain is performed and demonstrates no fungul or yeast like organisms. I am undergoing further blood tests and follow up with my pulmonary doc in a few weeks.

They are treating her for pneumonia but the x ray doesn t show it. She was diagnosed with COPD 5 years ago and has just recently stopped smoking. the xrays just say no acute cardiopulmonary disease. Retrocardiac Hiatal hernia. Emphysematous configuration to the chest. They have her on oxygen 3 per. steroids, antibiotics and 4 pills a day for cough and breathing treatments. It doesn t make sense.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion she is having acute exacerbation of COPD at present. The most common cause for this is infectious exacerbation. And viral infection is common cause.Untreated viral infection can lead to secondary bacterial infection. So antibiotics are must in the treatment. And chest x ray can be normal in early pneumonia. But this should not be the reason for stopping antibiotics. We have to give prophylactic antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infection."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have had asthma for quite a long time and treat it with salbutamol, salmeterol and beclomese something or other. I am male, 24 and a smoker. I also have rhinitis For the past week I have had all the symptoms of a cold; blocked nose, tight chest and headache. Today my symptoms changed a lot, my asthma was bad and have used my inhaler a lot. I feel very light headed. My hands feel numb, every now and the I get a sharp pain in my chest(several areas both left and right) I have a strong global wheeze and I occasionally get a weird feeling in my left collarbone, it feels like a heartbeat.What can I do?","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. I usually treat my such patients with regular montelukast+levocetirizine and regular inhaled corticosteroids for at least 6 weeks as your asthma is at present not well controlled.2. I would also suggest you allergy testing as it will help you identify the substances you may be allergic to and also to know the measures to avoid them.3. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which gradually works on immune system to improve allergy symptoms over long time.4. Regular steam inhalation and adequate fluids, preferably warm, during day will also help early recovery.5. Feeling heartbeats, etc could be due to side effects from salbutamol as well as salmeterol. Chest pain, etc could be due to gastritis or some other cause. Please consult your doctor regarding these symptoms.6. I strongly recommend you to quit smoking as smoking has very bad effects on asthma & rhinitis. It can also reduce effectiveness of some drugs. From my side, it is the most important step towards long term improvement in asthma & rhinitis. I would highly suggest you to seek a professional help for the same.7. In general, please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.8. Regular breathing exercises and a healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals will also help you in a long run by improving lung capacity and immunity.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I have chest pain located around the costal cartilage at rib 4.

Do to the healing pleural layers are thickened.So this thick pleural layers rub with each other during coughing,  sneezing and deep breathing and produce pain.And these thickened layers also restrict the lung expansion during deep breathing and gives feeling of chest tightness.

Pulmonary embolism is life threatening condition. And in any such conditions or severe infection glucose levels tend to fluctuate alot. So it is not recommended to use oral glucose lowering drugs. So insulin is preferred.  Because action of insulin is immediate so better to control sugar spikes and avoid delayed hypoglycaemia. And high sugar levels are not due to heparin or coumadin.

See a doctor and get examined thoroughly"},{"Patient":"hello, I was suffering from cough and cold for 2-3 day, so my doctor adviced me to take lecope-m tablet for 5 days once a day along with mahaflox. After 5 days i was feeling better but not totally. So i went to consult the same doctor and he advised me to take Lecope-M MEDICINE for 1 month daily and once a day.. 8-9 days have already passed. Should i continue my medicine for the Month or i can stop taking this medicine. And is this medicine (lecope-m) harmful for my body if i took this medicine for a month.","Doctor":"See ideally mahaflox should have not been given foe a normal viral cold and cough. Such a higher antibiotic for no justified reason is foolish. Lecope again is a drug for allergic cough and cold due to asthma or allergic rhinitis. There is no harm if u continue lecope-M for a month, however it is not required.Consult another better doctor"},{"Patient":"I am 26 years old.I am feeling congestion in chest frequently during winter season. I was advised by my family doctor to buy a nebuliser and use Asthalin and Budicort liquids in it. Are these mediciness safe and effective enough to get relief from chest congestion?","Doctor":"If you have congestion every time during winters, then it maybe a sign of episodic asthma or allergic disease. Asthalin and budecort are safe however there are better options available than nebulization for use. Inhalers are cheaper and better alternatives for it with being portable and handy. But the first important thing to do is diagnose asthma.

The periodic chest pain you are experiencing may be from gastritis or peptic ulcer disease. An antacid and omeprazole could be of help.Concerning the swelling of feet, ankle and hand, I think your heart may be failing and not working proper (right ventricular failure). The numbness can be from a long term complication of high blood pressure, diabetes or electrolyte imbalance.

My sister has been a nurse for 20 years and has a lot of medical friends non that can explain the blood color? Of course we are all vey concerned. What is causing this?","Doctor":"I have never heard of orange color blood and before doing a USG gall bladder I think they should have done a bilirubin test to know whether the bilurubin is high and does she have a jaundice.

If not then is the possibility of sick sinus syndrome which is the disease in which pacemaker is dysfunctional and usually treated with pacemaker.

I have missed a week of work (I teach) and don t feel I am getting any better. I am light-headed, dizzy, and I continue to cough.","Doctor":"What you have is a post viral hyper-reactive airway disease.

Or does it sound like bruised ribs? I would have to go to the emergency room, so it will cost a lot of money for me. I would avoid it if I could but the pain worries me.","Doctor":"Rather than doing an MRI, it is feasible to do a Chest Xray so that we can visualize the bones and ribs easily. You can start a stronger pain killer like indomethacin 20mg daily twice or Naproxen 500 mg daily twice to control the pain.I was quite unaware that an emergency room visit can cost you more than an MRI, that u prefer doing the latter and not going to the ER.

Yes, it is quite possible to have allergy due to colour fumes. They are known allergen.Whenever exposure happens, these fumes go in the lungs and activate allergic inflammation.

If it comes positive in duration of Tuberculosis then need work up on MDR tb.IF no expectoration or sputum is negative and Xray is suggestive for tuberculosis then no need to start Anti Tuberculosis Treatment ( ATT).Then need High dose of antibiotic for 14 days and repeat xray and sputum. IF symptom like cough still persistent and patchy lesion still persistant then start ATT. But in my opinion Do CECT CHEST andsputum examination  . if patchy lesion is suggestive for active tb then start same AKT4The way which she prescribed is wrong . Try all Capsule in Kit within 30 minutes and Rifampicin in empty stomach.  Don't start ATT only on chest xray.If you resident of Delhi please visit LRS hospital in Mehrauli or any Chest Physician in Private Hospital. Because the way of taking ATT is wrong so she may be over diagnose ."},{"Patient":"hi doctor. iam 20 yrs old. about 1 month ago I had acute viral bronchitis. i still have frequent coughs with some secretions in the form o globules coming from lungs whenever i cough. also i have an unpleasant itching like sensation in the region over my sternal angle. whats the reason for this? please answer this","Doctor":"Viral bronchitis can result a lot many times into a post viral chronic cough and hence your symptoms of bronchitis. The itchy sensation in your chest is due to the inflammation in your wind pips. I will suggest you that you should start a steroid inhaler for some days so that the itchy sensation as well as the cough subsides."},{"Patient":"I have been sick for the past 8 days. Currently I am having sinus issues, fatigue, and a cough. The coughing is so bad that my lower ribs and abdomen hurt and my back between my shoulder blades. The cough is not a productive cough. Could I have pneumonia?","Doctor":"Yes if you have pain in the chest and fever continuously, it is very much possible that u can have a pneumonia. However it could just be a viral upper respiratory tract infection, which can be annoying sometimes and take a little longer than usual to subside. Do a Chest xray and see a chest physician to guide you properly for the treatment"},{"Patient":"How serious is Mitral value Repair operation?Is it mandatory to perform on a 25yrs old girl, Who has MVR?MVR is categorised as severe by few doctors and moderate by few more.

My daughter said the last prescription cost 180.00 for 30 doses and she cannot see any improvement.I m very concerned and would like to take him to a Specialist in this area..... It seems like he should be clear after this many dr. visits.","Doctor":"Sometimes children as young as 1 year old may keep getting frequent colds and coughs. These can be also an early sign of the child being an allergic individual.

Blood work today for organs in the area...but I m so scared What can this be? Sometimes radiates to my arm and on occasion can be felt on right side but only as of the past couple days. So so sensitive to the touch and so is my stomach area.","Doctor":"Sometimes it can just be a tender rib in that area that can cause these kind of pains on and off. Bone pains are sometimes unusually tender and takes longer time to go away.

I have been taking robitussin dm for cough & chest congestion and Advil for a headache. The headache is gone but my head still felt a little swollen. The last Advil was taken this morning. I have been coughing up mucous. My right arm feels tight. Is that normal?","Doctor":"The chest congestion and the headache with your arm pain suggest a viral respiratory infection. The headache is better as u said but the head cannot be swollen. If you are coughing up mucous, then take good steam inhalations three times daily with a expectorant cough syrup about 10ml three times and rest with lots of fluid supplements. If still not better then do a Chest xray and see a chest physician"},{"Patient":"I am currently taking prednisone for my asthma.

I am curious if the monster energy drink in combination with the prednisone caused this.not trying to sound stupid but I ve done this before and there were no problems","Doctor":"Stop trying to be brave and doing things you aren't supposed to. If you have done this before and had no problems, it doesn't mean you can do it again. If you are an asthmatic and on prednisone, that means your asthma is severe.

In my opinion it is mostly muscular pain only due to muscle twitching and spasm.But better to rule out cardiac cause first. So get done ECG.  If this is normal than no need to worry much for cardiac cause. Try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in muscular pain. 1. Avoid heavy weight lifting and strenuous exercise. 2. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 3. Take good painkiller and muscle relaxant. 4. Apply warm water pad on affected site. 5. Avoid stress and anxiety.

Following my discharge was given a weeks worth of antibiotic which ran out 4 days ago. Yesterday afternoon I started bringing up some mucus as I coughed which has a terrible smell, like burning rubber. I have an appt with my pulmonologist tomorrow at 0930.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Foul smelling in phlegm is mostly due to anaerobic infection. Empyema is also caused by anaerobic infection. So possibility of spread of infection from pleural cavity to lung parenchyma is there.So better to get  done repeat chest x ray and sputum culture and sensitivity to isolate the orgorganism.  This will helpful in antibiotic titration. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"Hi, Just for clarification, I had received my chest PA yesterday and the impression was, I have active PTB and densities in the right upper lung. What does it mean? Is it a serious disease??? It is transferable by sexual intercourse?? Thank you for your reply. Jaymee","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Active pulmonary tuberculosis on chest x ray means presence of cavitation, infiltration or both. This appearance is seen in active TB infection.  Active Tuberculosis means infectious. Tuberculosis spreads by cough droplets. When patient with active tuberculosis coughs or sneezes,  tubercular bacilli come out in environment as droplets and these droplets can spread infection. Normal healthy individual can inhale these droplets and may develop TB lesion in lungs.So active tb lesion on chest x ray is infectious. It does not spread sexually but due close contact in intercourse ,can spread through inhalational route in your partner."},{"Patient":"My son has been having red bull during his rivision and on the day of his exams he was rivising till 1pmbut by 3pm his heart was beating faster he was shivering and his hands and feet were going cold, took him to his doctor he pricribed him tablets to reduce it and some sleeping tablets but still his heart rate is still up the day after, could you tell me why its not reduce his heart rate?

You are having blunt chest trauma due to accident. So we need to rule out these things first as blunt chest trauma can cause all these. 1. Rib fracture2. Pneumothorax3. Pulmonary contusions4. Muscular injury etc.So chest x ray is needed to rule out all these.If chest x ray is normal than you mostly have muscular injury only. So try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1.

Under a lot of stress at the moment mum dad died I have had this before when upset. Could you please help thank you x","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Since you have ruled out cardiac cause for your chest pain,  I think it is anxiety related only.I believe anxiety is the cause because you clearly said that your pain worsens when you are at stress, after death of your mom and dad. This clearly indicates anxiety as the cause.So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions.  Try to identify the stressor in your life and cope up with it.Avoid tension. Be relax and calm. You may also need anxiolytic drugs too. Newer anxiolytic drugs are very safe, non habit forming and less sedative. So no harm in starting it, if necessary."},{"Patient":"Hi Doc! My x ray result is questionable opacities seen in the right upper lobe. Heart is not enlarged.Diaphragm and sulci are intact. Bones and soft tissue.Outline is unremarkable.Interpretation Questionable opacities, right upper lobe.

In this view apical postions of the lung are overlapped by bony structures like clavicle and first 2 ribs.  So any lesion in apical part of lung is not clearly visualised.  So proper reporting is not possible. To overcome this lordotic view is needed. In lordotic view x ray is taken in such a way that bony structures will not occlude apical parts. So better visualisation of apical area is possible. And due to this better reporting of the lesion is possible."},{"Patient":"I have a ptb history, I go for six month medication as prescribed my pulmonologist, he said that i have a minimal ptb.

What is the best thing i can do,thanks a lot","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should not worry much for pulmonary tuberculosis. As it will not cause back pain. Rare possibility of spread of tuberculosis in spine. And this can cause back pain. But chances of these are very very rare.There are other causes too, for back pain. Like osteoporosis,  spondylitis etc.So better to get done x ray of spine. And consult orthopaedic surgeon.

He gave no time for me to breathe in and out. Then said You will live Im still very worried because Im having shortness of breath. Is there anything I can do at home to help? Also should I go out to a different hospital since the medication is not working and because he did not check properly?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should definitely consult other doctor , if possible pulmonologist. As you may have lower respiratory tract infection ( LRTI ).  The reasons for these in your case are1. You are not improving with the current medicines. 2. LRTI is very common after upper Respiratory tract infection ( URTI );  if URTI not treated properly. 3. Coughing out blood ( haemoptysis ) and shortness of breath, both are seen in LRTI. So get done chest x ray to rule out LRTI.  You may also need sputum culture to guide the antibiotic therapy."},{"Patient":"My chest xray Roentgenological Findings state that; Linear densities are seen in the left lower lung field. heart is not enlarged. Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits. Diaphragm and costophrenic sulci are intact. IMPRESSION : Subsegmental atelectasis versus fibrosis , left lower lung field. Doctor, what does this mean? Thank you.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Atelectesis is partial collapse of lung segment. It is due to intraluminal obstruction by retained secretions ( mucus plugging ). Fibrosis is scar tissue. It is seen most commonly after any lung insult like pneumonia or Tuberculosis or trauma. So fibrosis is healed scar.So in your case we need CT THORAX to rule out atelectesis and fibrosis.CT gives excellent imaging of lung parenchyma and thus will be diagnostic in your case."},{"Patient":"hi i have a chest pain that i m rather concerned about. for the last week or two, i have been experiencing very sharp and uncomfortable shooting pains in my chest just below the left breast. it happens when i breath or, sometimes coughing and when i laugh. any idea what this may be?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.

He had a CT scan with injection and last week a PET scan. Dr. told us today it is probably malignant but wants to do a lung biopsy. What will the biopsy show that the PET scan didn t. This has been a very long 5 weeks. Thank you","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I want to ask you few questions first.1. Age of your husband. 2. Is he smoker or not.Nodule in lung needs thorough investigation.  Depending on the CT THORAX appearance, age and smoking habit, probability of malignancy can be predicted. If nodule has1. Larger size (more than 1 cm)2. Irregular margins3. Devoid of calcification4. Associated lymphnodes etcIn a smoker patient with age more than 50 years, possibility of malignant nodule is high.And biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis of malignant nodule.Biopsy gives tissue diagnosis and if it says malignancy than it is 100% confirm diagnosis. PET scan can show positive uptake in infection,  inflammation and malignancy.

In my opinion you should get done CT THORAX with contrast. In your chest x ray bilateral hilum  are prominent with widening of superior mediastinum.This suggest enlargement of lymphnodes in hilar area and superior mediastinum.Chest x ray will not clearly tell you about these lymphnodes.  As bony sternum is overlying it and makes difficult to interpret. So CT THORAX is needed for better evaluation. This will also give you the idea from where biopsy can be possible.

It will come normal mostly as you are too young for cardiac disease.  But better to rule out this by ECG. Try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid heavy weight lifting and strenuous exercise. 2. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 3. Take good painkiller and muscle relaxant. 4. Apply warm water pad on affected site."},{"Patient":"Hi Dr.DineshI have a problem with breathing. I am allergic to dust and I feel breathing difficult. I am using Levolin rotacaps which helps me to catch my breath. but for past  3 weeks, I am continuously using rotacaps as Iam feeling difficulty in breathing. Sometimes I have cough but its dry. I don't have fever.Also, I recently went under an operation for the treatment of thyroglossal cyst.Please  suggest me what should I do.","Doctor":"HelloSince you are having asthmatic attacks and livolin rotacaps , provide some relief , but  this time you are not getting  relief .Also  having cough ( dry in nature , as mentioned in the query) , dry cough is usually due to bronchoconstriction ( this is a characteristic feature of asthma ) . Recently also operated for thyroglossal cyst but this allergy may be due to dust , mite , fumes , sudden change in temperature , pests , pollen or mold .As these are certain predisposing factors for an asthmatic patient .When such case visit I prescribe them to take montelukast+bambuterol ( 10 mg each ) once or twice in day and my patient respond very well .Since this is a prescription drug so consult your doctor .However  , hot coffee and steam inhalation also act as bronchodilator and provide relief in cough and asthma .Hope this will useful for you."},{"Patient":"I have had bronchitis for 6 weeks now. It started as a low fever and after 4 days, I started coughing. It has been going on ever since(6weeks )About 10 days ago, I started getting a sore throat and pain in my ears and now one ear is completely stuffed, so I decided it wasn't just a case of stubborn bronchitis and I went to the doc 8 days ago, and was prescribed levaquin and prednisone. After 8 days,and nothing happening, I went back. They prescribed Z Pac and a bigger dose of prednisone. I am hoping this works, but I guess  am just looking for a second opinion. I am getting worried because I have never been sick longer than 2 weeks. I am 51 years old and do not smoke.","Doctor":"HelloAs you mentioned that you were having fever initially and after 4 days developed cough also .Took elvofloxacin and prednisolone and after this antibiotics changed to Z pack .Ear pain also started .All these symptoms  are for 6 weeks , may be due to these possibilities , these include:1 Tuberculosis ,as you are right , that this is not a case of simple or (stub born ) bronchitis . Diagnosis can be confirmed by  Xray chest , sputum for AFB and blood examination.2 Bronchiectasis , another most common cause of such symptoms . Diagnosis can be confirmed by physical examination as well sputum and clinical examination.3 Asthmatic allergic bronchitis ,this is one of the most common cause of such symptoms . Usually patient don't respond to antibiotics but require some bronchodilators.In my opinion consult a PULMONOLOGIST and get his opinion as 6 weeks passed.Hope this will help you."},{"Patient":"I am having pain in my upper left arm, came on suddenly several hours ago. When complaining about pain, noticed a bite on my arm. I had brushed something away earlier, thought it was an ant in our kitchen. Pain has not subsided, and bite has not really gotten worse looking. After this happened, hour later felt strange fluttering in left side of chest. Am I freaking out, or is this caused by insect bite?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Yes, it may be due to insect bite.When ever any insect bites, it releases some fluid in the skin layers and cutaneous vessels. And this fluid immediately causes inflammatory reaction at local site. So it becomes red, swollen and itchy. This is local reaction to the fluid. But after sometimes when fluid absorbed in the blood and reach the systematic circulation it can cause tachycardia (rapid beating of heart), which can give you feeling of fluttering in chest. So better to take antihistamine and anti allergic drug. If not improving in 1 day than get done ECG."},{"Patient":"HI, I been having a ache like feeling in the center of my chest and my left arm has been aching off and on. my arm only aches on my shoulder elbow and sometimes my wrist and fingers and I have a burning feeling between my shoulder and elbows at times.The Dr did a ekg,blood work and took xrays and everything came back normal so why does my chest and arm still hurt","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion it is muscular pain only. Since your cardiac and pulmonary work up Is normal,  it seems muscular pain mostly.

Any lung insult whether TB or pneumonia or trauma can cause scar in lungs after healing. And healing can occur by1. Fibrosis2. Calcification3. Rarely complete resolution. So yiu are having calcific lesion in lung due to past lung insult.  This is not active lesion. This will not harm you or community.  And no treatment is required as it is not a disease or harmful. And once a calcified nodule, always a calcified nodule. It will remain as it is. No need to worry for this.For your work visa related problems,  I advice you to consult pulmonologist and get done CT THORAX and Bronchoscopy and BAL ( Broncho Alveolar Lavage ) analysis for TB. If both are negative than you can argue visa authorities about not having active TB."},{"Patient":"Hi doc. Good afternoon I have a question regarding the result of my X-ray can u please help me because this is one of my requirements for pre employment.My X-ray result impression is no focal consolidations is identified. Suspicious densities in the right apex for which a follow up apicolordotic view may be of help if clinically indicated .","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Normal chest x ray is done in PosteroAnterior view (PA view). In this technique the apical part of both lungs are hidden by bony structures like clavicle and first 2 ribs. So any opacity in apical area can be masked or not properly visualised in PA view. So apicolordotic view will be needed.In this the x ray is taken in such a way that bony structures are not going to obstruct apical areas. So apical areas are clearly seen and better reporting can be done. So in your case apicolordotic view is must to rule out apical infiltration. Apical infiltration is seen most commonly with TB and pneumonia.  So get done apicolordotic view to rule out these."},{"Patient":"I keep feeling a dull aching pain on my left shoulder blade & it radiates to my chest. I do have problems with heartburn.

Do my own cooking and laundry, and small other things. My email address is YYYY@YYYY ......................0","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Since you have ruled out cardiac causes for your chest symptoms,  I advice you to consult pulmonologist and get done chest x ray and PFT ( PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST ). Squeezing in chest , cough and rapid heart rate can be seen in bronchitis and pneumonia. So PFT is necessary to rule out bronchitis and chest x ray is needed to rule out pneumonia. If both of these are normal than you should get done CBC ( Complete Blood Count ) to rule out anemia as this can also cause similar symptoms. If this is also normal than your symptoms must be related to stress and anxiety. So better to avoid tension,  be relax and calm."},{"Patient":"On the right diaphragm is elevate and I took MRI and is look good. The sniff test the right diaphragm show very little downward movement if any. I was informed to see the Dr. in six months for oxygen level which now is 65%. and I was informed the my right phrenic nerve is damaged any suggestion","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Diaphragm is very important muscle of respiration. Perhaps the strongest muscle. And it is supplied by single phrenic nerve.And poor movement of diaphragm is not always caused by phrenic nerve damage, but developmental defect of diaphragm can also cause this. Perhaps this is more common than phrenic nerve damage. Causes of poor hemi diaphragm movement are1. Developmental defect in either muscle or tendons. 2. Damage to unilateral phrenic nerve due to trauma, malignancy,  previous surgery, neuropathy,  snake bite etc.So better to consult pulmonologist and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"hi good day!!i have question.. My husband is having xray yesterday for his 1 of requirments.. the result of the xray was this Pulmonary Koch s Infection. minimal infiltrate in the left upper lobe with at 1.7 cavity. i just wanted to understand whats the meaning of this because he has a previous illness before about tuberculosis..also known as TB.plz i really need the answer.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Your husband' s current x ray report says he is having cavity with fresh infiltration.  These mean active TB infection.Cavitory lesion on chest x ray has high chances of having active,  infectious TB. If he has previous TB than this can be a healed lesion. But for this you need1. CT THORAX2. Bronchoscopy and BAL ( Broncho Alveolar Lavage ) analysis for TB. CT THORAX gives excellent visualization of lung parenchyma and much better imaging modality than chest x ray.So if both are negative for TB than this is probably due to past tb infection."},{"Patient":"Hi, im a woman of 65 years old, I had a bilateral pneumonia two months ago following a cholecystectomy. The x-ray before hospitalization was perfect. I was hospitalized for 1 week and 2 more weeks at home with antibiotics and rest, so i healed. After 3 months I made a new X-ray where it is Marked and common reinforcement design of the broncho-pulmonary failure with interstitial overload. hilar congested, not well decomposable .Clear costophrenic angles. Enlarged cardiac silhouette with ecstasia the aortic button . What does it mean? Should I be worried? (I was told that I have the lungs of a smoker but I have never smoked in my life, but I have lived with a smoker!). Has all of this to do more with pneumonia? or anything? Are my lungs at risk? thanks ps: sorry for my bad english im italian :)","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should first consult cardiologist and get done ECG and 2D Echo to rule out cardiac disease.Because your x ray findings like1. Enlarged heart shadow2. Bilateral lowerzone hazziness with hilar prominenceSeen mostly with congestive cardiac failure (CCF).Your age is also more (65) which also favours cardiac problem. So I advice you to rule out CCF first by doing ecg and 2D Echo.

Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT correlation can be obtained if needed. There is no evidence of any bulky retroperitoneal abdominal adenopathy, bowel obstruction, or ascites. Appendix is unremarkable. Moderately distended bladder in the pelvis. There are few scattered left colon diverticulosis. Impression: Few scattered left colon diverticulosis","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should not worry much about your CT report.Subcentimetric atelectesis and nodules are common  feature in old age or due to past pneumonia.  So no need to worry much as it is  benign thing, not indicating any Infection or tumour.Pseudo tumour in kidney can also be normal variant and accidental finding.And if you are not having any abdominal symptoms than no need to do anything for few scattered diverticulosis.

It s next week, but I m kind of freaking out with worry. What could this be?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. There are many causes for cloudiness on both lungs on CT THORAX.  But the common ones are1. Viral pneumonia2. Pulmonary edema like picture. 3. Interstitial lung disease (ILD)4. Bilateral bacterial pneumonia. 5. Bilateral TB lesion.6. Rarely bilateral metastases. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done repeat CT THORAX.

When we heard wheezing sound with stethoscope,  this is termed as rhonchi.It is seen with diffuse bronchospasm. Bronchospasm causes narrowing of diameter of bronchi,  so the air which is pasding smoothly earlies now feel turbulence in the flow and thus makes whistling sound which is known as rhonchi.So bronchospasm is the condition causing rhonchi. Now disease associated with bronchospasm and rhonchi are1. COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease )2. Acute bronchitis3. Brinchial Asthma4.

It can be simple increase of heart rate because of any stressor or after exercise.If it occurs in resting state, it can be also because of abnormal condition system of heart called as supraventricular arrhythmia. So you need certain tests to rule out same.1) ECG at the time of palpitation.

Fluid in pleural cavity is known as pleural effusion.  And broadly speaking there are two types. 1. Transudative.2. Exudative. Transudative effusion is due to causes other than pleural disease. It is seen in cardiac, liver and kidney diseases. It is basically due to fluid overload and low protien. And both of these are seen in kidney patients. Hemodialysis causes protien loss and this is the cause for Transudative effusion in your father's case. So better to get done protien level and start protien supplements."},{"Patient":"I just had a therascopic wedge resection of center right lobe of Lung , 24 hrs after suregery chest tube was removed and waited 4 hrs did a chest x-ray all looked very good sent me home have been home 2 days and I can hear fliud in chest cavity, is this a problem","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should first get done repeat chest x ray.Post procedure pleural effusion can be seen in many conditions ,but the common ones are1. Reactionary effusion. 2. Infective effusion.3. Leakage from bleeder (small arteries may left open by mistake and slow blood trickle can be seen.So better to get done chest x ray again. If fluid quantity is more than you may need diagnostic aspiration. And treatment according to the cause. So better to consult pulmonologist and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"I have had sinus and now lung mucus discharge ( thick white and not green or yellow) for over the past five months. I have had allergy test, several CT scans and five rounds of different antibiotics. No change in my condition. Could this be from my blood pressure medicine?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you are not having these due to your blood pressure medicine. You  may have bronchitis. It is basically an inflammation of bronchi, which causes edema and more sputum production.  Whitish sputum indicates inflammatory process , not infective process.Do better to consult pulmonologist and get done PFT ( Pulmonary Function Test ).  This will help you in diagnosis of bronchitis. It will also give you severity of the disease. You may need bronchodilators and antihistamine."},{"Patient":"hi dr, my cousin has had breast cancer, what type, im not sure. Her breasts have been clear from cancer for the last year, but she started to get shortness of breath, went to doctor and is in hospital now, has a lot of fluid on her lungs. She is awaiting cat scan, how serious could this be, doctors are not telling her a lot but they said the lungs have a lot of fluid and more than likely cancer is back. She has just got fluid drained. What do you think. Thankyou.","Doctor":"Your concern about your cousin is justified. The collection of fluid - what doctors call pleural effusion, can be due to many causes. But in the setting like that of your cousin, it is most likely due to invasion of cancer cells. As the fluid is drained, its laboratory examination and the CT scan will give you the definite answer.Hope I have answered your question. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help."},{"Patient":"every time I breathe in I get chest pain, it feels like a boulder is sitting on my lungs its very difficult to breathe, i have to breathe in very deeply to feel like ive got enough air in my lungs, but it doesn t help with the chill feeling boulder on my lungs, queries?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should first consult pulmonologist and get done PFT ( Pulmonary Function Test ) and chest x ray. Chest pain on breathing and urge to take deep breath can be seen in1. Bronchitis2. PneumoniaSo PFT is needed to rule out bronchitis. Chest x ray is needed to rule out pneumonia. If both are normal than no need to worry much.  It may be due to anxiety or due to muscular pain.So avoid stress and anxiety and take good painkiller and muscle relaxant."},{"Patient":"Normally my bp is lower than normal but in the Dr.Office it will climb way up dangerously up so today my Dr. put me on bp med. again and since last time my bp went so low I was seeing coloroed spots in from of my eyes and was dizzy pale and very unsteady I sat down and let it wear off. now she wants me to tak the med at bedtime. hoping I will sleep through the dizzines.

I recently started experiencing breathlessness and sometime pain in the chest after coming back from vacation from Ladakh. I don t smoke. I m allergic to bodyspray, my nose start to bleed and undergo irritation in the throat. Please advice","Doctor":"Hi Welcome to healhcaremagic After going through your query I concluded that you are having breathlessness. To investigate for the cause of breathlessness you should get your heart function test and lung function test including chest x ray AP view. Analgesic such as ibuprofen can be of use to relieve pain. Cetrizine will be useful in allergy. Vitamin B and C help in recovery. You can discuss with your doctor about it. Hope your query get answered.

But still getting the constant cough and burping every now and then especially after meals. It feels the worse at night and when I first get up. Not sure if it is GERD because I don t get the acidic burn in my throat. Any ideas.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should first consult pulmonologist and get done PFT ( Pulmonary Function Test ) to rule out asthma. As with out PFT asthma can not be diagnosed. So better to first diagnosed yourself and than start or change inhalers.Your complaints at present seem more due to GERD ( Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease ). It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms. Try to follow these steps for better management of GERD.1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 3. Avoid stress and anxiety. 4. Start proton pump inhibitor. 5. Go for walk after meals. 6. Keep 2 - 3 pillows under head in the bed. GERD and coughing can worsen each other. So simultaneously we need to manage both."},{"Patient":"i have a stabbing pain the comes and goes between my shoulder blades and moves to the front of my chest causing shortness of breath and extreme tightening.

It can be muscular pain but heart related pain should be excluded by doing heart function test. Treatment of it considering it as muscular pain is analgesic such as ibuprofen for pain relief. Vitamin B and C is help in recovery . Sometimes I apply local injection triamcilone with good results. You can discuss with your Doctor about it. Hope your query get answered.

Im scared.. Whats wrong with me?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you are having tachycardia which gives sensations of vibration and fluttering. So better to rule out cardiac cause first. So get done ECG to rule out heart disease like arrhythmia. If ECG is normal than we need to rule out anemia and thyroid diseases, as both of them cause ssimilar symptoms. So get done CBC to rule out anemia and thyroid function test to rule out thyroid diseases. If these are also normal than it must be stress and anxiety related only.So avoid stress and anxiety. Be relax and calm."},{"Patient":"I have a sharp pain in my upper rib cage just below my breast. It hurts to take a deep breath. Sitting down hurts worse than standing up. Sometimes the pain is so severe it makes it difficult to breathe and I can only take short breaths. It came on suddenly as I got out of the car at 3:30 this afternoon. It has subsided but comes back.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion it is muscular pain only.But since you are complaining of  shortness of breath and difficulty in breathing, we need to rule out pleurisy first. Pleurisy is inflammation of pleura and can be due to1. Pneumonia2. Pleural effusion3. Pneumothorax etcSo get done chest x ray first. If it is normal than no need to worry much.  It is muscular pain only. Try to follow these for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid heavy weight lifting and strenuous exercise. 2. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 3. Take good painkiller and muscle relaxant. 4. Apply warm water pad on affected site. 5. Wear chest belt to avoid mobilisation of affected area."},{"Patient":"There is an imbalance in mass between my upper and inner pectorals major area. I am right handed through surprisingly the right side of my chest is seemingly weaker and shaped slightly different. I ve noticed that that attachment near the armpit area has variance as well.

Have I torn my pectorals minor perhaps and not made a significant injury a result.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should consult doctor and get done exact measurement of your chest. This will give you more idea about asymmetry present or not.And if asymmetry is present than get done chest x ray to rule out these causes for asymmetrical chest wall.1. Fibrothorax. This causes shrinking of affected side.2. Muscular atrophy. (Unilateral)3. Unilateral absence of ribs4. Rarely pleural effusion on opposite side.So better to consult doctor and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"My boyfriend is 56 years old, never had heart related issues, and has been experiencing a slight flutter feeling in the upper quadrant of left chest.

Cath was done on heart which showed no blockages. They are saying they are using the last heart med at their disposal to get his heart pumping over 20% which is all it is doing. Infection and pneumonia are the culprits. What is the prognosis for this. He is in an induced coma.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion he is in septic shock. In this due to blood stream infection , toxic substances are released in the blood by bacteria and these substances cause cardiac damage and low function of heart and low Blood pressure.The only treatment for this is to give appropriate antibiotics to stop the sepsis.In my opinion get done 3 sets of blood culture and sensitivity and start antibiotic according to the sensitivity report. Prognosis is obviously not good if antibiotics are not working. It indicates infection with drug resistant bacteria.Pneumonia with septic shock with invasive ventilator support carries poor prognosis."},{"Patient":"I was sick with bronchitis for about 12 days then around the 15th day I started to have pain in my ribs on the right side below my breast. The pain has only gotten worse in the last 6 days. It hurts when I breath, cough or even move. I am coughing up thick white mucus. What can I do for this","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist and get done chest x ray and clinical examination of respiratory system. Your complaints like pain on deep breathing and coughing suggest pleurisy (inflammation of pleura). And thick whitish expectoration suggest lower respiratory tract infection ( LRTI ). Pneumonia can cause both pleurisy and LRTI.So possibility of pneumonia is more in your case.So get done chest x ray first to rule out this. You may need antibiotics and bronchodilators too."},{"Patient":"my sister had undergone TB test- skin test shows 8 mm , but blood test and suptum test are negative..........but chest xray shows a white patches so my doctor suggetsed CT scan..................will it be the findings of the TB or not.

Old scar (healed Fibrotic) lesion. EtcSince her Skin test and sputum both are negative for TB, white  patch is less likely to be of tuberculosis. CT THORAX gives excellent imaging of lung parenchyma.

Thoracic surgery is ofcourse a major surgery.It is done under general anaesthesia and very much expertise is needed.In your surgery, sternum and ribs will be separated and operative field will be achieved. So you may require blood transfusion too, during surgery.So don't think this as small surgery,  it is a major surgery with a lot of risks. Better to consult your operating surgeon again and discuss all these in depth."},{"Patient":"Hi, About 4 weeks ago I had a slight cough, running/stuffy nose and slight fever for a few hours. Typical cold symptoms for me but I then lost my voice; well I could talk but I had to whisper. All other symptoms were gone by this point.

No cold symptoms until yesterday; sore throat, yellow mucus and tons of coughing. Now my chest hurts and throat is still sore. Coughing is still happening but not as bad as the morning. Is this bronchitis? No fever this time, as of yet. No headache or chills.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you are having upper Respiratory tract infection ( URTI ).In bronchitis inflammation of bronchi cause edema in the walls. This causes narrowing of the lumen and causes bronchospasm and wheezing (whistling sound).Thisis the characteristic feature of bronchitis.  So I don't think it is bronchitis,  you must be having URTI mostly pharyngitis.

Impression: bone island versus pulmonary granuloma,left. What does it mean?is it dangerous and needs to worry? Thank you in advance.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should not worry much about this report. In Calcified lesion on chest x ray , possibility of malignancy is very very less. So no need to worry for cancer.Any lung infection after healing produce either fibrosis or calcification.

In my opinion you should first consult pulmonologist and get done CT THORAX to rule out plate atelectesis. This is segmental partial collapse of lung mostly due to retained secretions in the lumen. So small segments can cause partial collapse and produce linear(plate) atelectesis.  And this can be seen as linear density on chest x ray.So CT THORAX is must to rule out this.Treatment for this is chest physiotherapy and antibiotics.

In my opinion you should first consult pulmonologist and get done CT SCAN of THORAX and Bronchoscopy and BAL ( Broncho Alveolar Lavage ) analysis for TB. If both of these are negative than you can argue with visa authority that you are not having active lung infection. Any lung infection especially TB heals by1.  Fibrosis2.  CalcificationBoth of these appear as scar tissue on chest x ray. So we need to prove that this is not due to active infection,  but due to old infection. To prove this you need CT and Bronchoscopy.

Wear chest belt to avoid mobilisation of affected area. 6. If weight is more than try for weight loss."},{"Patient":"My cardiologist said I have trivial/mild mitral leak and mild left atrial enlargement. That the normal is 38 but I m at 39.

In my opinion you should first get done thyroid function test (TFT) which includes T3, T4 and TSH.Hashimoto's thyroiditis can have hyperthyroidism spells.And hyperthyroidism can cause palpitation which gives feeling of fluttering in chest.So get done TFT to rule out this.If TFT is normal than get done ECG to rule out cardiac causes of palpation.So get done TFT and ECG."},{"Patient":"I sometimes have horrible chest pains on theleft side of my chest under my breast.

(or do you want to refer to pleural effusion, which accompanies a pneumothorax, making it a hydropneumotorax)Since the nature of pain you have described, it fits into pulmonary embolism.Causes for pulmonary embolism include prolonged immobility, surgeries, accidents, OC pills, hyper homocystenemia, cardiac abnormalities (afibrillations).Pulmonar embolism has been mentioned as a cause of secondary pneumothorax in the literature.

Since your cardiac work up is normal no need to worry much for this tingling sensation in chest.Other causes like 1. Anemia2. Thyroid problems3. Anxiety etc. Can also cause tingling sensation in chest.So better to get done CBC (Complete Blood Count) to rule out anemia.  Get done S.TSH to rule out thyroid related problems. If both are negative than you are having anxiety mostly. Better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Identity stressor in your life and start working on it.Be relax and calm.  Avoid stress and anxiety."},{"Patient":"I was told that I am in the early stages of emphysema this week at the VA hospital where I go for various treatments, I also did not do very well on the exhaling portion of the breathing test I took for them. I am 72 years old and have been smoking off and on for approx. 40 years. The last startup,after a 12 year break, was 9 years ago after my wife passed away. CURRENTLY I DON T SMOKE A LOT ,5 A DAY.

It includes both emphysema and chronic bronchitis. And COPD is progressive disease. We have to manage it to halt the progression of the disease. So better term for COPD is chronic manageable disease. Life long treatment is needed. And for this you should consult pulmonologist and get done PFT ( PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST ) to know the exact severity of the disease.  As treatment of COPD is based on severity of it.You need to follow below mentioned steps simultaneously for effective treatment. 1. Quit smoking as soon as possible. 2. Start inhaled bronchodilators3. Enroll in pulmonary rehabilitation center where chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercise are done. 4. Get done vaccination with pneumococcal and influenza vaccines for prevention of future lung infections.

Pleural effusion2. Pneumonia3. Lung metastases Malignant pleural effusion is very common in thyroid cancers and if present can cause pain on inhalation. Pneumonia is another possibility. And if worsening of lung metastases is there than this can also cause pain.So better to get done chest x ray and if needed CT THORAX to rule out all these."},{"Patient":"my daughter (14) keeps having pain in her *lungs* .

Do you have frequent burping? Any Cough?Which all medications have you been taking? Does it include an Antacid?Since ECG was within normal limits we can rule out a cardiac cause. Though a repeat ECG can be advised if chest pain is recurrent.Chest X- Ray can be useful in ruling out many etiologies of chest pain.

Physiologically it is most commonly associated with anxiety, and can very well be managed by breathing techniques and other anxiety allaying methods. If it is affecting your daily routine it can be controlled by anxiolytics medications. But mind you, these medications are not available without doctors prescription. When pathological, they signify an abnormality in conduction of cardiac impulses. They are best to be evaluated by a cardiologist and I reffer you to the same for that.

In my opinion you should first consult gastroenterologist and get done upper GI Scopy. Since you are telling that you have dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing) and feeling of lump in throat, any esophagus structural abnormality can present. So upper GI scopy is needed to rule out structural abnormality. If this is normal than no need to worry much. It is heart burn only. It is due to reflux of the stomach acid into the esophagus and cause the symptoms. And reflux Disease needs simultaneous approach of following steps.1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2.

It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms.

In my opinion you should first consult pulmonologist and get done ultrasound examination of chest.After treatment in pleural effusion, healing occurs by pleural thickening.  So on chest x ray both thickening and effusion look similar. So ultrasound is needed to rule out effusion. In my opinion your husband has pleural thickening,  not effusion. TB infection can cause morphological changes in lung and makes it more prone  to bronchitis. So breathlessness in your husband's case can be due to bronchitis.  So we need to rule out this by PFT (PULMONARY Function Test). So no need to worry for effusion,  it will be thickening only. And get done PFT too."},{"Patient":"Check up last week indicated sound heart and sound lungs.

Another test that is very important is an ultrasound of the heart. You might be having back flow (regurgitation) of blood through the valve when the heart is pumping or you may be having impaired ventricular filling when the heart is resting (valve stenosis). I would suggest you do this test.I hope that helpsI wish you well"},{"Patient":"I have been having a continuous cough off and own for about 12 years. It is a cough that sort of tickles your throat. I have been to doctors and specialists; they run all types of tests and all come to the conclusion that it is an allergy. Some have suggested medication, which doesn t help. This is a dry cough.","Doctor":"Hi, thank you for asking healthcare Magic.One other condition that can cause this is Gastro-esophageal reflux disease. To effectively control it, you need drugs and some life style modifications.Concerning drugs, you may need to take a drug that would reduce the amount of acid secreted like omeprazole, pantoprazole or ranitidine for about 1 to 2 months.Concerning life style modification, you need to avoid eating late in the night, sit up for about 1 to 2 hours after meals before going to bed, avoid food that would increase acid secretions like spicy foods, fatty foods, caffeine-containing foods, alcohol and pepper..You can also take s drug that could render the cough productive like carbocysteine.I think you could get better if you try these measures.I hope that helpsI wish you well"},{"Patient":"I had breast cancer lady July.

Notwithstanding, I think it might be related to peptic ulcer diseases or an inflammation within the pleural cavity. Concerning peptic ulcer diseases, I would suggest you try an antacid with another drug like omeprazole, ranitidine or cimetidine for some days. If you feel relieved, then continue for about 2 weeks.If there is no improvement, I think you would require some tests like a chest X-ray or chest scan to rule out an inflammation within the pleural cavity.I hope that helpsi wish you well"},{"Patient":"Hi I am Chirag.

Given antibiotics for my chest infection. She is referring me to haemotology (urgent). Apparantly I was diagnosed with Christmas Disease in 2012 it says on the doctors pc. I was never told tho. I really dont feel that well. Just taken my diclofenac and Zapain. I have noticed spotting on my feet. I had Idiopathic thrombycitopenia P in 1994. I am scared it may be back.. Could this be anything else? Been sweating loads, out of breath. Chest pain..Generally weakness.","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome to health care magic.Thanks for your query.Since a diagnosis of Christmas disease was made that is a blood clotting disorder caused by a mutation of the factor IX gene, leading to a deficiency of factor IX. There is a greater propensity to develop hemorrhage and the treatment is by intravenous infusion of factor IX. Factor IX has a longer half life than factor VIII (deficient in haemophilia A) and as such factor IX can be transfused less frequently.The symptoms of sweating, out of breath, chest pain are most probably due to the underlying Christmas disease which has caused high metabolic state and weakness.I'll advice you to stop medications no your own without proper consultation with a hematologist because for instance the medications you had taken (that is diclofenac, paracetamol and codeine) can worsen your condition.     I'll advice you to  consult a hematologist for proper line of management of your underlying disease condition.Wish you a good health.Thank you.Dr. Kidev.s."},{"Patient":"I was using titralac as an antacid when needed.

Nothing I have tried works like Titralac. Do you have any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hi, thank you for asking Healthcare Magic.Protonix and titralac are drugs used to treat diseases related to acid secretion in the stomach. These two drugs work differently and produce satisfactory results when they are associated. When a peptic ulcer is involved, you need to take treatment for 2 to 4 weeks. Other antacids that may work efficiently include Tums, maalox, Topaal, etc. I would advise you take the antacids in association with Protonix for at least 2 weeks. If possible, do H. pylori test to see if this bacteria is responsible for the problem.I hope that helpsI wish you well."},{"Patient":"Hello Dr. I had an Angiogram about 6 weeks ago due to pain in my chest when I was doing Insanity workout a few times.

The first sample is a spot sample and the second is usually a next day morning sample. If any of these or both are positive we start the treatment. If both are negative as in your case, the physicians check for x-ray and if the x-ray is suggestive of Pulmonary Tuberculosis then they can start you on treatment.Some physicians after getting 2 negative samples put their patients on antibiotics and then repeat a 3 sputum sample after 14 days. If it is positive then they start treatment or else they take a x-ray and decide if the person needs treatment or not.Remember sputum test are reliable but they are not full proof, many patients who are suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis may have negative results and they are referred to as \\"sputum smear negative pulmonary tuberculosis\\"Hope that answers your question.Regards, Dr.Imaad.(if the answer has helped you, kindly indicate this)"},{"Patient":"I am 13yr old male and today i got up and got this sharp pain under my rib on my lower right lung.

Thanks, Cassiee.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you should get done chest x ray to rule out internal damage in the lung.If chest x ray is normal than no need to worry much.Keep the bruise part dry. Apply betadine and neosporin on it. It will start healing in 2-3 days. Avoid rubbing and itching on it."},{"Patient":"Hi i keep getting a sharp pain at the top of my ribs on the left side it will last awhile then turn into a dull ache i just wanted advice also I have been sweating a lot which might be nothing to do with the pain but i don t usually sweat this much thanks for your time amy","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion we should rule out cardiac cause as most common cause for left sided chest pain and perspiration is heart problems. So get done ECG and 2D Echo to rule out cardiac cause.If this is normal than get done CBC and thyroid level (S. TSH) to rule out anemia and thyroid diseases.As anemia and thyroid problem can cause chest pain and perspiration. If both of these are also normal than your symptoms are mostly related to stress and anxiety. So avoid stress and anxiety.  Be relax and calm."},{"Patient":"Hi, I'm a 29 year old woman with a family history of heart disease and high cholesterol. My cholesterol was elevated at my last checkup and I was placed on simvostatin and Ezitimbe (both of which I had to stop taking due to the severe side-effects) For the last 4 months I have been experiencing palpitations - twice so severe that I ended up at emergency - and occasional sharp chest pains. I was prescribed inderal tablets and they eased the palpitations, but did nothing for the pains. I have done a resting and stress ECG, a sonar of the heart, chest x-rays, thyroid tests, potassium and iron tests..... and countless more. Nothing seems unusual. The palpitations returned about two weeks after I finished taking the Inderal and have only recently started subsiding, when I started taking a magnesium suplement. The chest pains, however, seem to be increasing in severity and lately I have been experiencing cramps in my neck and left arm. I have been taking asprin when this occurs and it seems to help. Should I ask for an angiogram to be sure that all is o.k? Since no other test seems to show anything.","Doctor":"Hi,If the stress echo is normal than angiography must also be normal. Still if you want you can get a CT coronary angiograpy done.The causes tachycardia are many.As your ECG was normal. But was that ECG taken during the period of palpitation? If yes & that too was normal than there are other tests like EP study to see any arrhythmia coming from heart. I expect that to be normal too. Sometimes in females during menses due to hormonal changes heart rate increases. So that is also a cause. One other condition is called orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in which heart rate increase on changing posture. Test to see that is Tilt Test.Hope this helpsRegardsDr Sameer Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"I have been to the dr they don t seem to worrid but I have been getting this feeling in my chest like something is stuck and pressure like I was under water to long and dizziness and faintn but just for a second then sharp pains in my upper left shoulder","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Your all symptoms are suggestive of cardiac cause. So we need to rule out this first.So get done ECG and 2 D Echo to rule out cardiac cause. If both are normal than we need to rule out pleurisy(inflammation of pleura) as shoulder pain , breathlessness and chest tightness can be seen in pleurisy.So get done chest x ray to rule out this.If this is also normal than no need to worry. Your symptoms are most probably due to anxiety. So better to avoid stress and tension. Keep calm and be relax."},{"Patient":"I have late stage copd, past smoker, quit 16 yrs. ago. My parents and childhood Dr are now dead. My first pulmo dr told I had come into something more than cigs because of my scarring and other signs, I was then 44. I had numerous strept throat infs in grade school, until tonsillectomy when I was 14. Not too many yrs later, I began the usual, just peer pressure. I am the oldest child of 4, all or breathed 2nd hand, no one comes close to me. I am dying younger than my bio parents. Some thing has always seemed strange to me about Clorox! I asked my mothers older sisters, said no, yrs ago, forgot it! Asked my younger aunt just recently, she said yes . You got into it when your sis was a baby, you were a toddler not even quite 2 Sorry, got carried away, could this the original culprit?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Clorox may or may not be the culprit but smoking is definitely the cause for your COPD.Now the important thing is to start treatment rather than searching for cause. As COPD is irreversible and progressive disease. You need to start treatment to halt the progression. So consult pulmonologist and get done chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to know the severity of the disease as treatment based on severity only.Treatment consist of following steps.1. Quit smoking.2. Start inhaled bronchodilators in the form of meter dose inhalers having long acting beta 2 agonist (LABA) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).3.Enroll in  Pulmonary rehabilitation programme where chest physiotherapy is available. 4. Vaccination with pulmonary vaccines like pneumococcal and influenza to prevent future lung infections."},{"Patient":"I have recently been diagnosed with MVP and have moderate to severe regurgitation.

But in this humidity I feel tight in the chest, or like I can t get a full deep breath. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you are having worsening of heart disease only.MVP with moderate mitral valve regurgitation can lead to pulmonary edema due to back pressure in lungs. And this gives feeling of chest tightness and difficulty in taking breath. So I advice you to consult cardiologist first and get done repeat 2D Echo to know the status of valve potency.If worsening than mitral valve replacement should be done.Start diuretics to relive pulmonary edema."},{"Patient":"my dad is saying he is having difficulty in breathing at night, he is 69 years old and had openheart bypass surgery 3 years back. it is happeneing only at night, tomorrow i took appointment with cardiologist, since he is in US as a visitor, should i think of preponing from end of september trip back to india to as soon as possible ?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion your father has heartissue only.As post bypass patient tend to develop heart failure after 2-3 years of surgery.And characteristic feature of early heart failure is orthopneoa (breathing difficulties in supine position). This is due to back pressure and high afterload. So consult cardiologist and rule out early heart failure. Your father may need ECG and 2D Echo for the diagnosis.

Are you smoker?2. What is your age?In my opinion you are having bronchitis.And bronchitis can be seen in smokers and old aged patients. As your symptoms like chest tightness, breathlessness points towards bronchitis only. Your cardiac work up is also normal. So possibility of bronchitis is more.So consult pulmonologist and get done chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will also indicate severity of the disease.

I had a medical examinations last month and the result was QUESTIONABLE INFILTRATES UPPER LEFT LOBE and I retake the xray test, the result was APICOLORDIC VIEW SUGGESTED FOR FURTHER EVALUATION . What does this mean? I hope you could find an answer to this problem. Please give me suggestions for what I can do with this! Thanks Doctor!","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Routinely chest x ray is taken in PA (PosteroAnterior) view. So in this view the apices of both lungs are not clearly visualised. The bony structures like firat two ribs and clavicle can obstruct the view and so upper lobes can not be visualised properly and hence reporting is not accurate. So to overcome this, apicolordotic view is taken. In this chest x ray is not taken in PA view. It is taken in such a way that bony structures are not hindering apices and clear view of apices (upper lobes) is possible. So it is modification of PA view to get better and accurate view of upper lobes.So get it done."},{"Patient":"During my 4mph walk on my treadmill after 50 minutes as I was going into my cool down I felt fluttering in my chest then a pounding with no pain but lightheadedness then rapid heartbeat.

I'm sorry to hear that you are experiencing such symptoms. Random heart beats in a 21 year old can be caused by many things, I'll adress the likely candidates. Is there pain associated with these random heart beats? Have you started any new medications recently? If there is pain I would be concerned about something involving the Chest Tube insertion/pneumothorax. If not there are other possibilities! #1 could be caffeine, alcohol and or any toxin/medication use that your body does not respond well to. Another could be blood sugar. If your body is not obtaining the nutrients it wants sometimes it will respond with the shaking and fast heartbeat you describe! I suggest you try to eat smaller meals, but more often, hydrate, and assess how much caffeine, alcohol and alternative medications you may be taking (Steroids, anything other than multivitamins). If you change this around and see no improvement, or experience chest pain, certainly have yourself checked out by a physician. I hope this helps!"},{"Patient":"I have been having random chest pain over the last 2 years or so. The pain comes on quick and usually lasts about 20 minutes or so.

I have had a ekg and my doctor says my heart looks fine. So why the sudden pain?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Since your cardiac workup is normal I think your symptoms are mostly related to anxiety. Better to avoid stress and tension. Be relax and calm.Another possibility is GERD. It is Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Due to this acid of the stomach tends to come up and cause the symptoms. So tty to follow these for better control.1. Avoid spicy and hot fod.avoid stress. Avoid large meals. Take frequent small meals.2. Start proton pump inhibitors. 3. Go for walk after meals.4.

In lung tissue any insult like infection, trauma can produce healing by either fibrosisor calcification. And these gives appearance of scar tissue on chest x ray. And this will remain as it is through out the life.One thing you can do. Get done CT THORAX and bronchoscopy with BAL (BronchoAlveolar Lavage) analysis for TB.

It is possible that you are suffering what is called \\"Peripheral Neuropathy\\". It is where the alcohol and its affiliated nutritional deficiencies and dehydration involved will deplete much of the energy and nutrients needed to supply the nerves which provide adequate and accurate sensation to the limbs. I highly recommend of course that you discontinue alcohol and tobacco as they are of course very detrimental to your health. However in the immediate future, I would recommend supplementation to ensure your body is receiving the proper nutrients for proper nerve energy (These are: Multivitamins, B-12 + Folate).

It is not infection. It is inflammation of lungs mostly due to inhalational injury.So ask your radiologist about possibility of GGOs. As treatment is consist of steroids only.10-15 days of steroids are sufficient to improve these GGOs. Steroids show dramatic improvement.

And chances of malignant nodule are high when age is more. And malignant nodule can occur with out any history of smoking. As old age is an independent risk factor for lung malignancy. I advice you to first get done CT THORAX. As CT gives excellent idea about1. Exact size of nodule.2. Shape of nodule.3. Surrounding lung tissue affected or not.4.

I was told i need to cut down on my portion sizes of food which i dont eat alot or go for seconds little to none food is fried dont drink or smoke or use extra salt was told to walk as gardening or housework is not excersise Im at loss as to how and why all of a sudden And does magnesium tablets help or hinder sleep having trouble sleeping too at night go to bed really tired and within mins i am tossing and turning forever Will that affect blood pressure thanks","Doctor":"Good evening. There are many aspects which can cause fluctuations in blood pressure values. The main causes of alterations in blood pressure that I see in patients are most often caused by caffeine, changes in activity, and or stress. If you are finding yourself living a lifestyle where there is less consistency, and or stability, it would also show itself in your blood pressure results, and any hormonal imbalances and or previous cardiac conditions and or medical regimens can alter this chemistry as well. I will be honest in saying that 157 is concerning, wheras 119 falls in the range of completely normal. My suggestions to stabilize your blood pressure are as follows... 1. Hydrate. 2 Less Sodium (Salt) and or Caffeine. 3. Stress Relief 4. Maintain a steady medication schedule (if you take any medications - make sure to take them at the same time per day as instructed).I hope this advise helps!"},{"Patient":"I have had numerous lung infections and intersticial lung disease.

Please help with any possible answers to this. Thank you.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion the doctors may suspect either blood malignancy or bone marrow infection.When in peripheral smear we get precursor cells like myelocytes and metamyelocytes possibility of malignancy is high.And in advanced stage this kind of patient can show lung metastasis.  So bone marrow is needed to rule out this.Another advantage is if the treating doctor suspect chronic blood infection than isolation of organism from bone marrow can be done.So get done bone marrow to get further evidence s."},{"Patient":"My wife was found to have a blood clot in the lungs, as per cat scan.

As GERDif untreated can produce dry cough. And you are having burning flames which suggest acid reflux. GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Due to this the acid of the stomach tends to come up and cause the symptoms. So better to follow these.1. Avoid hot and spicy food.2. Avoid stress and anxiety. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals.4. Take proton pump inhibitors. 5. Go for walking after meals.6. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in bed.If not improve in 1 week than get done chest x ray to rule of pulmonary causes for cough."},{"Patient":"i am a 33 year old male.

Wear chest belt for minimal mobilisation of affected part."},{"Patient":"Hi my name is Cylllhia, I have low blood pressure since is left the hospital. I had my lung drained of fluid as well as my abdomen this past Friday. I check it today and out the three readings I did the highest was 88 over 55. Should I go to the emergency room?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you should definitely go to the hospital as this much low pressure can lead to oragn hypoperfusion and permanent damage. So you should not keep this much low pressure for long time.The cause for this may be poor pumping of heart or infection or fluid loss in the body due to drainage of fluid.So you need to investigate for causes of hypotension. You need fluids and inotropic support to achive blood pressure."},{"Patient":"I have had a some what severe sore throat for over a week .I have treated it with every otc med I can think of.I went to an independent clinic that claims I have an upper respiratory infection. I am in a lot of pain and have a low grade fever that only breaks with ibproferin .They will not give out antibiotics .What can I do, go to my primary doctor for antibiotics or is there anything over the counter that will clear this up?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you should do following things simultaneously to achieve good relief in URTI.1. Avoid oily and spicy food.2. Do warm water gargles 5-6 times a day.3. Take macrolide group of antibiotic. 4. Take antihistamines5. Take antiinflammatory drugs.Take all these for 5 days and if not improved than get done chest x ray to rule out lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI)."},{"Patient":"For the past month or so I have noticed that I get very bad chest pains when I lay down in weird angels or if something is pressed on my chest. My girlfriend likes to sleep on my chest and even that slight pressure hurts like hell. Im 16 and im not sure what is wrong with me. My back also tends to hurt a lot and im not sure why. I have told my doctor about this and he said its probably just my muscles. Any advice/ideas?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion it is muscular pain only.But weneed to rule out cardiac cause first. So get done ECG to rule out cardiac cause. If this is normal than you might have muscular pain only. Try to follow these for relief.1. Avoid strenuous exercise. 2. Avoid heavy weight lifting. 3. Avoid bad postures in sleep.4. Take good painkiller and muscle relaxant. 5. Apply warm water pad to the affected area."},{"Patient":"My wife has had a terrible cough since Oct of last year. Chest x ray came back normal and the doctors have given her steroids which help but when done it starts back up again. They say it is a respiratory infection, what is the cure, she does not smoke and hasn t since 2005","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist first.As chronic cough needs PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) for diagnosis. In my opinion, since your wife has been responded with oral steroids, she may have chronic bronchitis.So PFT is needed for the diagnosis. So get done PFT.Oral steroids are indicated only in few cases of chronic bronchitis.  So better to avoid it. Start inhaled corticosteroids and long acting beta 2 agonist for better control. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"My mother has just been diagnosed with a tumour in her lung she is waiting for an appointment to see what kind of tumour whether its cancer or not and which form.....a couple of years ago she had bowel cancer and had half her bowel removed and was doing really well, we are concerned obviously and wonder whether there will realistically be a treatment available ? She is in her early 80 s too so difficult age to be coping with this.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion the present lung tumour might be malignant only. Since your mother had bowel cancer chances of lung metastases are very high. So better to get done PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scan and if there is hot spot than probability of malignant tumour is high. You may biopsy to confirm this.Treatment will remain palliative chemotherapy only, as it is stage 4 cancer so surgery is not indicated.So better to consult oncologist and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"My sister has been coughing for 1 month. A doctor suggested that she take an x-ray. The result came out a saying that there are suspicious densities on her upper lobe and apicolordotic view is suggested . Her doctor is currently on leave and we are already worried about the result, we cant wait for her to comeback. What are the possible diseases that may have caused this densities? Also, what maybe the cause for having her take this apicolordotic view.","Doctor":"Suspicious densities means the radiologist isn't sure whether there are densities or not and if there are then what ?Apicolordotic view will confirm whether there are densities or not, as the clavicle will not obstruct the view.Most probably it looks like tuberculosis if there are upper lobe densities, however we need to do further investigations to confirm and clinically confirm a disease"}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(a=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return a.Patient.toLowerCase().includes(e)||a.Doctor.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},B={class:"card-container"},q=["disabled"],R={key:0},O={key:1};function G(a,e,l,c,i,s){const m=g("PoemCard");return o(),n("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔 AI effective tips collection 🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),p(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>i.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[f,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",B,[(o(!0),n(b,null,w(s.filteredPoems,(r,y)=>(o(),v(m,{key:y,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...r)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...r))},[i.isLoading?(o(),n("span",O,"Loading...")):(o(),n("span",R,"See more"))],8,q)):I("",!0)])}const N=u(E,[["render",G],["__scopeId","data-v-3f58639f"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"chatai/34.md","filePath":"chatai/34.md"}'),F={name:"chatai/34.md"},z=Object.assign(F,{setup(a){return(e,l)=>(o(),n("div",null,[k(N)]))}});export{L as __pageData,z as default};
