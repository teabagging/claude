I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, I would have first done a physical examination of your abdomen, followed by some blood tests like a complete blood count, a liver function test, a serum amylase and lipase, blood sugar, urine routine and microscopic, and possibly an ultrasound to rule out gallstone disease/pancreatitis which could give rise to such excruciating pain in abdomen and back. Also in the history, if you consume alcoholic beverages and do smoke, then I would insist on complete abstinence from both as both could cause pancreatitis. Till the reports are ready, I would advise you to adhere to a bland diet, and avoid any oily,fried and spicy food, and prescribe you with an anti spasmodic and a proton pump inhibitor for a symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

You are probably having a vertebral column injury or spinal cord injury or just post traumatic pain ( due to pressure on your back muscles and subsequent inflammation). Spinal cord injury is most unlikely because if you have, you should have started developing nervous deficits on your upper or lower extremities depending on level of the lesion on your spinal cord. Cord compression due to vertebral column displacement is another possibility but as i said developing neurological deficits would have been showing as symptoms except of course the injury is very very mild and also pain will not be the most likely symptom. Vertebral column injury will simply be a small fractured bone  of a vertebrae or displacement/dislocation which would present as a pain of progressive intensity as you continue daily activity. The other option is you are having back muscles contusion that should disappear with use of analgesics like as acetaminophen or Tramadol or anti-inflammatory like diclofenac or ibuprofen either orally or local pomade with massaging. In either case, you will probably need to visit a radiologist to run a CT scan or X-ray of the vertebral column to rule out any serious abnormally. Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi, How are you?

One of the most common casue in India could be Tuberculosis and for that you need to get an MRI done which will help to rule out bone TB. Or they could also send your CSF for TB PCR which will slo help in ruling out this condition.

I also suffer from headaches (which I believe come from my back?) and tiredness, which leads to dizziness and general slowness in thinking etc. I had an MRI in 2009 of head and neck which I was told was clear, however when I was pregnant this year I was sent back to neurologist who had a look at it again and thought there might be a suspected syringomyelia . I had another MRI after I had my baby which has come back clear. I also had a scan on my lower back in 2009 which showed minor tear and wear. I have had blood taken tested for b12, thyroid ect which were normal.

Beside this a plenty of disorders can cause such a pain. The most common are cholecystits, appendicitis, colitis or any intraabdominal infection. If you have any other symptoms such as fever, chills, nausea, blood in the stool or urine i suggest you to go to hospital as soon as you can no matter you dont have an insurance.

In view of the low back pain, presence of lump and vomiting, your finace requires detailed evaluation to determine the cause. The most common causes are infective, such as tuberculous or bacterial infection. An MRI scan of the spine (with chest wall) would help in correct diagnosis of the problem. In the meanwhile, you can use analgesics such as diclofenac or ibuprofen for pain relief, and ondansetron for vomiting.

It doesn t curve the way it should, instead it s like it just goes straight down; so when I sit on any surface, especially a hard one, my tailbone hurts because it is coming in contact with whatever I m sitting on. I ve had alot more back pain since I ve started sitting at a desk all day. Could the two be related?","Doctor":"Hello. I'm Dr. Christensen. I'm sorry you're having back problems. Even people with anatomically normal tailbones can develop back pain while sitting at a desk all day; for someone with a tailbone deformity, back pain is even more likely to occur. For one thing, you're probably altering your posture to compensate for your tailbone deformity, and this is undoubtedly straining your back. For another, if your tailbone has some anatomical anomalies, it's possible your lumbar or thoracic spines aren't quite right, either. X-rays or MRI might be needed to determine if that's the case, but it's something to keep in mind. You might benefit from using a chair that's more ergonomically appropriate for you. Physical therapists can be helpful in this regard. (Some employers retain physical therapists who offer ergonomic evaluations to employees, so you might ask your boss if he/she has any suggestions.) At the very least, a doughnut pillow might allow you to sit more comfortably in your chair and take the strain off your back. However, if your problems persist, see your doctor for an evaluation. I hope that answers your question. Good luck!"},{"Patient":"three days ago I felt a pull in my lower right back which has since subsided.however I am unable to stand due to severe pain in my right leg.The pain is definately muscular and is relieved only when leg is bent.

The commonest cause of back pain is mechanical, due to prolonged sitting required for jobs, computer use, studies, driving, etc. One needs to strengthen the back muscles to prevent pain in the region. These exercises are referred to as back extension exercises. You can learn them under the guidance of a physiotherapist. For pain relief, you can use ketorolac or diclofenac gels over the painful area of the back.

There are two likely causes for your mother's symptoms: 1. Arthritis of hip joints- it is common in older people. X-ray of the hips can help in diagnosing this condition. 2. Lumbar disc disease with compression of the nerves at back- this can lead to pain and weakness of legs. An additional condition to exclude is osteoporosis- weakness of bones- which is again common in old age.

Also when I cough i feel lots of pain in lower back area....what can this be?","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. There are two likely possibilities for your symptoms: 1. Infection- it can lead to bruising, pain and swelling over the back. In addition, there may be fever and increased warmth over the affected area. 2. Small hematoma- blood collection in the soft tissue. This is more likely, if there is any injury of the affected area, or if you are taking any blood thinner medications. An examination by a doctor can clarify the issue and help in planning treatment.

Has low back pain radiating into left hip. Here is his MRI results: L1-2 minimal posterior annular bulging asymmetric to the left, there is no central canal narrowing or neural foraminal narrowing. L4-5 there is a disc bulge asymmetric to the left with a superimposed small to moderate broad-based left subarticular protrusion type disc hernaition. There is mild facet and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy . These factors combine to cause moderate narrowing of the left lateral recess , and likely impingement of the traversing left L5 nerve root . There is no right lateral recess narrowing. There is no neural foraminal narrowing. L5-S1 there is a disc bulge asymmetric to the left. There is mild narrowing of the left lateral recess but otherwise no central canal narrowing. There is mild left sided neural foraminal narrowing He is to start physical therapy in a few days. My question is - could he have sustained all of this through basketball?","Doctor":"Hello, At 17 yrs of age he is too young to have developed so many disc bulges. The symptom also suggests the compression of the nerve root due to these bulges. Usually such changes are seen in elderly. In your son these are probably related to basketball playing and associated exercises. He may be an individual who is predisposed to this and aggressive playing has precipitated it. The predisposing factors could be in the form of abnormality of collagen formation (there are diseases in which collagen protein s not formed normally and it can lead to musculoskeletal problems). He needs to undergo evaluation for that.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.It is not necessary that you too would also get the same pathology as your mom had. However it is also necessary to investigate the cause of your pain making you pass out frequently. If I were your doctor, I would advise you for an ultrasound of whole abdomen to rule out the possibility of calculi either in the gall bladder, common bile duct or in the ureter causing such excruciating pain or a pathology oif any other intra abdominal organ.

I am now in so much pain, sitting, standing and when sleeping the pain radiates down my right leg, especially around the knee area. I had a hip replacement 11 years ago too. I have always had back pain , but this has got worse within a couple of months so it has deteriorated rapidly. I am 43 and with 3 children, plus I do a lot of walking so I don t seize up. Do I need to see my consultant and get another MRI scan?","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for the question. You have increasing back pain and now you are having radicular symptoms. I would say YES, you should see someone about these. You have 3 children relying on you and you should get better for your sake and the sake of the children. Once your doctor examines you and takes a history, he or she will likely want an X-ray series. Based on that and comparison to the prior films, an MRI may be a consideration. CT is also an option with concern for fracture. In your case, I would favor the MRI for many reasons: 1. You have a prior MR for comparison. 2. No ionizing radiation. 3. MRI is better to evaluate for radiculopathy. 4. If there is a fracture, MRI can help date (or age) the fracture.

Backache may be due to muscle dysfunction or spinal disc degeneration. Sheurmann kyphosis is increased thoracic kyphosis however it needs to be differentiated from postural kyphosis.

About 1/2 a year (quite possibly a full year) I was strongman conditioning with my step-dad (which included me lifting a bunch of things that I could barely lift right. So I was finally getting into shape (since even with conditioning I am still overweight , was striving to become fit.) So, stupidly, I lifted something that was about 450 pounds total (225 in each hand on a farmers lift for a competition we were gearing up to do.) Instantly felt something wrong, so as weeks progressed my back became terrible in condition. Went to the doctor and she sent me to physical therapy . After a few sessions of physical therapy I got the exercises I was meant to do there, and to save money just decided to do them at home. (they didn t require any special equipment despite all my complaining of my back.) So ever since then it has been kind of dormant, sometimes hurting other times not. Fast forward to recent times, I started a job. Basically being on my feet for the entire period of time, doing different jobs with different back stresses. That stuff doesn t bother me in the moment, it just waits until I get home. Once I get rested in my bed, I tend to forget / have to do something and get up. It has gotten to the point where I cannot stand, or if I can stand i have to have something to hold onto the entire way. It feels like my legs are going to just give out with excruciating lower back pain (worse than the initial injury and physical therapy weeks). I would just really like to know what I am dealing with, potentially. I should be able to stand up as much as the job requires me to, there are plenty of young people (overweight and not) doing the exact same thing as me and not complaining. I would like to know how serious this could be. Please, if any light can be shed on this it is much appreciated. Also if you need me to clarify anything please say so, its about 4:00 AM and I just got off work so I don t expect some of this to make sense.

I know from personal experience that back disease can be debilitating. Disc bulges are NOT uncommon.  They only need to be treated if they are implicated as the cause of your symptoms. They are NOT always symptomatic. If your only symptoms are pain and you do not have other problems like bowel or bladder issues, weakness, or progressive symptoms then it makes some sense to hold off on surgery.  However, it is hard to disagree with a neurosurgeon who has the advantage of history, physical, and MRI images and report. I feel your best option is to get a second opinion before completely writing off surgery.  In the meantime:  Consider PT, anti-inflammatories, icing alternating with warm compress (see which is better), icy/hot or ben gay, an over the counter back brace, walking. Another option may be spine injection which should be considered prior to surgery. I agree that surgery should be reserved only if the other treatments are not working. Best of luck, I hope you start feeling better."},{"Patient":"hello doctor, i am 24 yr male, suffering from middle and upper back pain for the last 5 days. Muscle became stiff and it was hurting me whenever I was leaning back n front or using any reclining chair. I consulted with a general physician who prescribed me PANIDO-40 & UGESIC for 4 days.

This is a temporary condition but can occur again if you do not take measures to modify the cause which led to this condition: for example, you might need to change your chair or pillows.

The complaints of pain in the middle of the back for two years and its presence on and off suggest that mostly it could be mechanical in nature. As you had mentioned some thing to do with the posture it is true. I would advice you to consult local orthopaedic surgeon who might rule out other causes of back pain. If there are no other major causes of back pain i advice you to learn some back and abdominal strengthening exercises from your physiotherapist and continue doing them at your home.

Among other medicines, I have also been prescribed Meganeuron OD plus ( methylcobalamin , alpha lipoic acid and vitamins), which I understand is a supplement , Are there any side effects of taking this medicine? Thank you. Sinecerely, AAAAAA, Delhi, India","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM I, Dr Shailja take the opportunity to answer your query. The history of back ache which is more on getting up from chair or bed and X-ray findings of a problem at the level of L5-S1 indicates disc herniation or disc protrusion or prolapse. A disc made up of fibro-cartilage is present between two bny vertebrae. It acts as a shock absorber. Sudden getting up can cause this disc to move out from its normal position. The protruding the disc causes symptoms of pain by compressing the various nerves in the vicinity. Its management is conservative initially consisting of rest and supplements if required. supplements mentioned by you does not have any side effects if taken in prescribed dosage. A displaced disc is at high risk of prolapse if there is no prolapse initially. You should avoid picking up heavy weights and no to bend/ stand up from a bending position suddenly. This may aggravete the problem. Take rest and further a MRI may be required. Stay in touch with your treating doctor.

It usually get better over a period such as few weeks (4-6 weeks). You are not a candidate for discectomy surgery.

I do a lot of weight training and I rum 3 km 3 times a week. For the last two years i have been having intermittent back pain in the lumbar region which usually settles with a few days of rest. Over the last 1 month however, the back pain seems to becoming more intense and longer lasting. 2 weeks ago after a 3 hour drive i gradually developed severe Left sided back pain radiating to the posterior part of the left thigh. An MRI taken the next day showed prolapsed disc involving L4-L5 and L5-S1. 2 days after that, i started having pins and needles over the posterior part of my left thigh and lateral part of left foot and weakness of my left calf . I was started on celebrex 400mg od and baclofen 1 tablet bd. Since then the pain has greatly subside. I would say 80% of the pain has dissappeared. The pins and needles and my calf weakness however has not improved. I can extend my foot but am completely unablen to tip toe . Can anyone suggest if surgery is indicated or can it still be treated conservatively? Do calf weakness return back to normal either with or without surgery?

Infection of the kidney which can be precipitated by having stones. I do not know your age, but with pain for so long, one must always consider more concerning things like cancer. Maybe the old kidney infection has nothing to do with this new pain. What about an actual back condition or other musculoskeletal diseases like muscle and rib issues.

Sounds like your doctors do not yest know what is going on. When a back MRI is done, a scout film or localizer is acquired. A pelvic lesion was probably seen on this localizer or even on some of the other cuts.

I have received my MRI scan after many months of back discomfort and the report says its all normal except at the last observation which says: Lumbar spondylosis with small posterior central bulge L5/S1 disc mildly indenting the Thecal sac and nerve roots. It gets very uncomfortable when I sit in the same position for over 10 minutes or so, Sometimes when I sit on hard surfaces I tend to feel some numbness in my legs or pins and needles which takes a few minutes to go away after I stretch ... Also last time I was doing my training ( boxing ) I noticed that when I was doing jumping exercises after a few minutes I started not being able to lift my legs in the jump with much agility, almost like I didn t have total control of them and my balance was clearly disminished on the landing of each jump.. What could this be and what can I do? Thank you for your attention","Doctor":"Hi, It sounds like your symptoms are out of proportion to the MRI findings. The MRI indicates that there is mild indenting of the thecal sac and nerve roots. This is subjective, but does not sound very significant. Bottom line, your ordering physician must correlate these findings with your symptoms. Some docs consider a nerve conduction study or spinal injections for localization of symptoms.  My concern is that you should also look elsewhere given the striking symptoms versus the mild disease on MRI.

Lying down helps with the pain but it is still there even with with it being about a 5 - The only thing I can think of that might have caused this is the HCG diet or I had to help my husband push his big heavy motorcycle up on a stand. Went to dr s for something else on Monday and he just gave me some muscle relaxers (pulled muscle?) but even taking those and a pain pill - it still hurts.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for posting your query with us. The pain you have looks like it did definitely start with the episode of pushing the motorcycle up on a stand. If the pain is radiating into one of your leg then you need to visit an orthopedic doctor. He would assess your pain and give you pain killers and medicines to relieve swelling. After the rest and medicines, you would need to start on physical therapy to prevent another episode of a similar pain. The physical therapist will assess and teach you exercises for the strengthening of your back and once you continue the exercises for about 3 months you'll have a strong back. If your pain at the moment is just in the lower back region and that to maximum on sitting then you can simply apply some heat and take muscle relaxants for 3-5 days and start with a few exercises. That should help relieve your pain. The exercises include 1. Bridging 2. Knee to Chest 3. Straight leg raise to 30 degrees on both legs 4. Static abdominals 5. Hip abduction and extension 6. Cat and camel 7. Superman exercise for back Hope this helps. Get well soon."},{"Patient":"Hi.

Someone said costrochondritis (spelling) fits with my symptomps?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for posting your query with us. Well the pain that moves from the low back and to the upper back and shoulders can be mechanical in nature. If you have a lot of stress at home or at work then you need to take some days off. Go to a good physical therapist who would assess the strength of your lower back and your shoulder muscles. A good exercise regimen to strengthen the muscles will help ease off the pain. Take a muscle relaxant for a week or so and do hot water fomentation on the painful area. Also at times, such pains are due to deficiency of Vitamin D3 or calcium so get these levels checked in your blood and if a deficiency comes out then visit an orthopedic who would prescribe you some supplements to make up for the loss. Till then, maintain a good posture, start exercising, decrease the level of stresses and eat a healthy diet to stay fit.

Thanks","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Your pain looks like a back spasm only. If the episodes repeat or continue in a similar pattern try applying some ice as it helps in relieving the spasm and controlling pain. Also you can apply a pain relieving spray that gives instant relief from the pain. As a long term goal you need to understand and find the cause of the pain. Do you have a sedentary lifestyle and also do you do any form of exercise?? Is your job a long working hour sitting job?? Or do you have a stressful lifestyle?If the answers to these questions are a yes - that is you don't exercise, do not follow a balanced diet, have a stressful sedentary lifestyle, and drive or sit for long hours then you fall in the category of patients suffering from Mechanical Low back ache. And believe me, the pain really makes the patient suffer. For a permanent solution, you need to start eating well, take a high in calcium, protein and fiber diet. Also start exercising for your back and abdominal muscles. Strengthen your hip and gluteal muscle and once the pain stays away for a while start swimming, cycling or jogging for long term benefits and creating an efficient lower back and a fitter body.

Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Utkarsh Narang"},{"Patient":"hi doctor this is me pankaj jaiswal from nepal doctor i suffering from backache(while sitting and bending ) from last around 5-7 month and i went to simple physician after he seeing my x-rays report of my lumbar part he told me that i am having lumbar spondylosis problem for that he had given me few tablets that is gabaneuron, neorelax( aceclofenac ) or thioclococide, calcium tablet and pan 40 and suggested me to use lumbar belt and also to do some exercise i have taken that tablet for 10 days for a few days like 4 days i was experiencing my backache was little bit reduced after than i had discontinued that tablet and ofcourse exercise and again i am having the same back ache problem , actually i am not satisfy with that doctor suggestion so please give me suggestion that what could i have to do to just get rid from that pain and also suggest me what type of exercise that i have to do. i will be really thankful to u if u reply me asap","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for posting your query. The medicines help in reducing the initial inflammation and masking the pain. You need a good assessment of your back. The actual diagnosis of a low back pain depends upon the age of the patient, cause of the pain, and certain tests need to be done. Does your pain radiate into the leg or is it just in the lower back (where you tie your belt)? If it radiates into the leg then that is a red flag symptom and needs immediate assessment. If the pain is on and off in the waist region and does not radiate then you can be less worried. The best treatment of any low back pain is to exercise well and make your back and abdominal muscles very strong. The core muscles mainly the multifidus and the erector spinae protect and support the spine. You should visit a certified Ortho Physiotherapist and he would teach you exercises to strengthen your muscles. Generally a 3 month long exercise program strengthens the spine sufficiently that then you should not suffer from pain. Some examples of exercises that you can look up on the internet are 1. Bridging exercises 2. Straight leg Raise 3. Static abdominal towel press 4. Knee to Chest 5. Hip Abduction/ Extension These are the basic exercises that will help your pain but you definitely need to visit a good physical therapist.

THe unbearable pain in in left lower abdomen after surgery of hip replacement with prior UTI is indicative of an infection in the operated site. It is possible that you had an active focus of infection which was not under control in spite of an antibiotic cover. I would suggest you to undergo MRI of the operated hip joint along the abdomen to see for the possibility as explained. Also advisable is blood culture and sensitivity, urine culture and sensitivity to get the sensitivity report so that proper antibiotics can be started."},{"Patient":"For about two weeks, my mother has been experiencing back pain in her right middle back as well as pain in her side/front under her rib cage.

The same symptoms, only this time I noticed that her right middle back was a little swollen. Any ideas on what s going on?","Doctor":"Hello!!! Thanks for posting your query with us. I wish you had described the tests a bit more clearly. I'm guessing the doctor did an X ray plus some blood tests and all came clean. The pain in the middle back - Is it right under the shoulder bone (wing like scapula bone) at the back?? If yes then the pain could be due to an alteration of the scapula bone. This happens because of weakness in the scapulo thoracic muscles. You can probably go to a physical therapist and get a few sessions of ultrasonic therapy and icing to take care of the swelling. Also how old is she?? Does she have any chest infection as then she needs a physician right away. You can help her strengthen the scapulothoracic muscles by finding the following exercises online. 1. Scapular Retraction 2. Shoulder Bracing 3. Shoulder push-ups standing (push on wall) 4. Shoulder External Rotation (actively) As far as the rib cage is concerned if there is nothing wrong with the blood tests and x rays then make her do some breathing exercises and stretching for the pectoral (chest) muscles. Also make her inflate a balloon 5-10 times a day so as to strengthen her chest and breathing muscles. Hope this helps her.

Then, about 7 weeks ago, I tweaked my lower back while doing a simple lift at the gym (a deadlift, only about 65 pounds). This caused me to be completely out of comission for 3 days; could barely walk and all movement was excruciatingly painful. My doctor said it was a muscle strain and prescribed me with pain killers and muscle relaxants and recommended that I see a chiropractor. Since then, I ve been experiencing extreme lower back pain off and on. I am wondering if it s possible that these two incidences are related to each other. Is it possible for an injury to be delayed this long or be worsened by another less impactful movement? If so, what should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for posting your query. It seems the hip injury and the dead lift injury are not related to each other. They are two different episodes. The pain you felt is most probably because of the dead lift. Dead lift is a tricky exercise and even a weight of 65 pounds can put pressure on your lumbar disc. A faulty mechanics during the lift must have caused excessive strain and thus the pain. Try taking some muscle relaxants and apply ice on the region. Also go to a physical therapist and he'll work on your core muscles and your abdominal muscles. Perform exercises on the regular basis so as to have a strong core. A strong core and abdominal muscle will protect your lower back and thus help in relieving the pain by improved bio mechanics. Also an assessment needs to be done by an orthopedic to check if there is any problem or pressure on a disc leading to pain in your back. Is there any radiating pain in your leg??

I had a cat scan it showed the kidney stones my back was alignedand the spacing good. My mri shows more. In the terms they put it says that Ihave degeneration of the L4 L5 disc deseccation of the L5 S1. A small protrusion. Thinning of the thecal sac . And the conus extends beyond L1. I have no idea what this means? I have tried physical therapy and with in hours I am almost paralized. They are gonna send me to the pain clinic. Should I be on a set of pain medication?

As you said its related to your motion so first is to rule out any rectal, colon or anal problems which can give rise to back pain. Get examined by a general surgeon to rule out this problem.

Lumbar disc herniation usually cause back pain with radiating leg pain. If its the first episode then it is initially treated with conservative treatment like medicine and physiotherapy and some times nerve root block. In most cases the pain subsides. However if you have huge disc herniation with severe nerve root compression (seen on MRI) and non resolving pain with above treatment in about 4-6 weeks then you may need surgery. Most people afraid of surgery and they said its not effective but I would say microdiscectomy is very much rewarding surgery. Nowdays with newer surgical techniques it has become simpler and quicker surgery with minimal risks. To tell you exactly about the treatment in your situation I need to see your MRI.

In simple words, it is called slip disc. Your long driving hours are aggravating the condition. Just wanted to know if an MRI was performed or this was just a clinical diagnosis. Initial treatment is pain medicines and rest. If symptoms are not subsiding in 2-3 weeks, an MRI should be done (if not done already). Depending on the severity of the disc prolapse on MRI and your symptoms, further treatment could be an epidural injection or a microscopic Discectomy. This condition is very much treatable, in a safe way. Recovery is almost immediate and you can resume back to your normal life in 2-3 days, barring heavy activities. Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi.

I had been inebriated at the time so I didn t feel any pain initially. Later that evening, I began to feel sharp pain in my back but (having forgotten about the fall) just chalked it up to my history of carrying a lot of tension in my back (as a violinist). By the end of the week, I was in pain no matter what I did. Sitting, standing, laying down, fetal position-- nothing helped. Hanging myself over the back of a chair (balance point being my middle/low stomach) helped a bit, but otherwise it was intense radiating pain. A relative of my friend with some experience in massage therapy took a look at my back. There was a large hard lump in the lower-middle of my back (among the highest lumbar vertebrae ) that I had thought was just part of my spine (seeing how hard it was) but which she said was definitely not supposed to be there. Massage helped relieve a lot of the pain, but the lump was still there, though smaller. My back remained generally stable during the next week (unless I carried a backpack in which case I would be in immediate intense pain and would remain in pain for the rest of the day). By the end of 7 days, though, the massage had lost its effect and I was in pain again. I received another massage that alleviated pain for about a week before I was in a lot of pain again. Sometimes the pain would just return of its own accord-- always radiating. Sometimes leaving me breathless . In the past 5 days or so, on a few occasions when my back has started hurting, my fingers, hands and arms have started ticking/spasming. Sometimes violently. Decreased some with advil . The lump is still there and pressing it is uncomfortable and gives me a sensation similar to free-falling. Should I go in for an x-ray or do you have an idea of what the injury might be?","Doctor":"Thanks for the query. Injury to your back can cause muscle, ligament sprain or bony fracture. The lump may be a haematoma in the soft tissue. It may indicate significant injury to spine. Its better to get the xrays of the spine to rule out fracture. In case of back injury rest is the only way to relieve the pain.

Please Advice.","Doctor":"Hi! Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, after a physical examination of your abdomen, I would advise you for an ultrasound abdomen, a blood complete blood count, a blood sugar, a liver function test, a serum amylase and serum lipase and also a urine and stool routine and microscopic examination.  These investigations would be required to rule out any urine/stool infection, gall stones, and any inflammation in liver and pancreas which could give rise to such symptoms. Till the reports come in, I would advise you for a proton pump inhibitor, an anti spasmodic and a probiotic for symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

First of all, the PCOD is an irrelevant issue now that you are pregnant.  You may need earlier screening for gestational DM, but the issues regarding the left ovary or no longer present now that you are pregnant. With regard to your question, here is what you know: 1.  You are pregnant 2.  There is a sac in the uterus 3.  You are either looking too early or it is a possible miscarriage It is not unusual for the apparent growth of the pregnancy to be off in terms of when you think you got pregnant.  In your case, do not worry and schedule an ultrasound in one week (before next weekend).  By then, everything should be much more clear. I hope this helps.

Do you have any leg pain also or is it only back pain you are suffering from? If it is only back pain, then treatment will be mostly in the form of physiotherapy. You can take a short, continuous course of pain medications, but definitely not for long time as they are harmful. You should avoid tread-mill and weight training exercises. They will do more harm to your back. Swimming or stationary cycle is good.

Along with this, i am having pain in my upper back also, some time it become very severe and it become hard for me even to laid down on bed on any position. Is this problem is also related to my disc herniation? Please suggest what to do next. I avoid any pain killers, i improve my diet with milk, non-veg, dry-fuits, not sure if this all help me out in heeling my problem.","Doctor":"Hi, Treatment for disc herniation depends on many factors and based on all that the treament strategy in made. Important factors considered are symptoms, age, activity and presence of worsening symptoms of the patient. Now treatment modulity available for this condition are many and most of the time it is started with the conservative step. Most of the time if it is not very complicated and impairing than rest and activity modification, application of ice and heat, physiotherpay, using of pain killers are done in the initial stage to control the condition. But this is not going to permanently cure this condition. After all this if it is not working than steroid is also used first in the form of oral dosage and than epidural steroidal injections. After this only the role of surgery is there which is the last resort to contro and cure the condition. Taking you age in consideration and activity level I think you can avoid surgery and can cotnrol your condition with the more conservative treament. but if it is not wotking than you can think for the surgery also. hanks and take care."},{"Patient":"for over a year iv been getting back pain which started lower back pain. since then the pain has spread to shooting pains to my stomach . now im getting pains on the right side of my back shooting through to my stomach. im in so much pain cant even walk for 2 minutes without beeing in cripling pain. please tell me whats wrong with me????","Doctor":"Back pain radiating to stomach could be due to issues of the abdominal organs.

It is nice to know that you have already recovered and doing fine. I think it is time for you do start your regular exercises under an expert. You can even perform yoga under the supervision of an expert adviser. Take calcium and mineral tablets and food rich in vitamins anti-oxidants, fiber and low in lipids and carbohydrates. Look to your posture, never lean forward while working or standing. Take care of yourself. A hormone called relaxin secreted ( in excess ) during child birth may be a cause of your backache. As your hormone balance gets back to normal you will get fine. Yes, you need to see your gynecologist and get clinically examined and have all investigations and radiology done to rule out any causative factor which may be responsible for the pain. You need routine blood tests to rule out generalized weakness. Have agood day, take care."},{"Patient":"Hello.

Physiotherapy is essential, and you will need to stretch in the long term.  However, in the short term, you MUST NOT OVER STRETCH THE PAINED AREAS.  Indeed, a back brace/strap is essential to support you through this acute phase rather than pushing through with excessive therapy.Heat and cool therapy will also be excellent, and I would recommend NSAID medication such as ibuprofen.If you are carring any injuries in your knees or ankles, or if you have a problem with your instep or gait would also be exacerbated by jogging, and could \\"jarr\\" your back.  I suffer from this terribly with cycling; which forces me into uncomfortable positions for long periods of time, and also when jogging on my arthritic left knee.Typically, back pain is a muscular pain, and will tend to \\"move around\\" as different lower back muscles take up the strain at differing times.

The annulus is not suppose to bulge out of its space and if it does or if the nucleus bulges out , it can potentially compress the nerves that may be in close proximity of the vertebra and cause symptoms such as back pain, abnormal sensations , weakness. Narrowing of the spinal canal may occur if the discs are degenerating. Treatment varies but usually starts with bed rest for about a week, use of pain medications.After this time period physiotherapy is initiated. I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"I have been suffering for the last 2 weeks with pain in my back. Thought first that I pulled a muscle, but 9 days ago ended up in hospital with excruciating pain.

The back pain was due to kidney stone. It is also the cause of blood seen in your urine (Hematuria). It is possible that full stone has not passesd out or some particles of the stone were not cleared, resulting in deposit of more particles and formation of stone again. This may be the cause of pain repeating again. You can have Ultrasound and X-Ray KUB region to confirm the diagnosis. Also have a Urine investigation done for Routine and Microscopic examination to check whether some infection has been developed due to the stone. Hope this is useful to you.Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi, Doctor Im a 53 year old female and Im not sure how to word the different things or symptoms that i am experincing in my body and that i see with my eyes,but i will try and i hope you or someone can help me with some answers.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.From your history and symptoms, it seems that you might be having a pelvic infection (PID) associated with a urinary tract infection (UTI). If I were your doctor, I would advise you for a urine test (routine, microscopic, and culture/sensitivity test), a complete blood  count (CBC), a blood sugar test, gram-staining and culture sensitivity of vaginal discharge if  any and a review ultrasound of abdomen to rule out any other intra-abdominal pathology. Till the reports are ready, I would advise you for a braod spectrum antibiotic along with a probiotic, a proton pump inhibitor, and an anti inflammatory drug.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

If you get relief and the pain reduces than try to go back to your work slowly. But if their is no relief and your pain increases even after rest than get your X-ray done and consult your doctor for further treatment and investigations. Complete rest is the best treatment for back pain. Best Wishes and get well soon"},{"Patient":"Hi , i m Ivan. I have been having very little back pain , it comes and goes though. But i m not sure what the cause could be? Maybe an excersize that I do, such as lifting dumbells or doing sit-ups, or maybe even sitting at my desk chair for too long. It s nothing too serious but I just want to know how to get rid of it. By the way i m 17.","Doctor":"such backache could be because of ur poor postural habits and low back muscle tone. So along with ur dumbells do flexion and extension exercise of back, and sit straight in ur office chair rather than in reclining pose"},{"Patient":"Hi, I was jogging and after about 4km/ 2.5 miles I started walking and suddenly got severe back pain and could not take deep breaths . Bending over helped a bit and it passed after a couple of minutes. I have asthma but take foxair twice a day which keeps it under controle. I am not fit at all just started running . Any help will be great. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,If you have begun jogging after a long break, then you should prime your body. Don't start directly with 4 km. Start with 1.5 km for a week, and increase your distance slowly over a period of 2-3 weeks. What has happened is that because your muscles are in continuous need of oxygen during such sudden, strenuous exercise, and your body is not able to supply it, it switches to anaerobic mode of energy production (wherein oxygen is not needed). Kind of like taking a detour from the usual path. The problem here is that because of this alternate mode, a lot of lactic acid gets produced in the body as a by-product and gets stored in your muscles. This gives rise to pain, because lactic acid gets separated from your muscles very slowly. Your back muscles have gone into a spasm. Do some hot fomentation, take rest from jogging for 2-3 days or till the pain subsides. Then begin slowly. Don't worry, you'll get back to your 4 km run slowly, albeit, a bit slowly.All the best!dr.neharv@gmail.com"},{"Patient":"Okay, my stomach has been hurting on and off and I keep trying to go to the bathroom(to poop), but no luck.

Before you start any sort of treatment I would suggest you to undergo colonoscopy and biopsy to determine the cause, get blood, urine and stool tested and also undergo ultrasonography.

He told me I have a slipped vertebra above sacrum and demonstrated on a plastic spine . He also mentioned that nerves were misfiring causing abnormal muscle tension in glute and hamstring and other leg muscles going unused.( I have been doing physio to strengthen thighs. I had arthroscopy , debridement and removal of bone cysts 2008. Cartilage damage in left knee then only stage2, right a little better). I have not got my scan results. The extreme discomfort in lower back stabbing and wrenching pains in hip and odd numbness side of left leg worsening steadily.I cannot find a comfortable position to sleep. Any activities are severely unpleasant. I have an active job in retail and I find I cannot do things at pace anymore as I cannot tolerate sudden movements .I find bending down to access low objects a torture which I have to force myself to do. This makes me urinate too frequently, strangely lifting heavy objects is not any more painful than the bending.( When I first started having back symptoms I thought it was severe cystitis and even had a course of antibiotics.) Walking to and from work is also a torture. I cannot even handle sitting in one position for very long esp on hard chairs. Luckily I do not have the opportunity to sit at work except for on a kickstep (I work 50hrspw ave). I still go to gym about once a week where I was told the leg press is helpful.

From your history it looks like you have unstable spine and you are a surgical candidate. This problems can be cured completely with surgical management. Daily dependence on pain medications is not advisable and it has adverse effects. Do you have Lateral flexion and extension xray? MRI? need to see that. You will be back to your work in 2-3 weeks after surgery. Also this is not only about pain, I think you started developing neurogenic symptoms and signs and in that case timely interventions gives the better prognosis.

Sometimes the pain will go into my hips and legs. It has gotten to the point that I can stand at my sink for more than five minutes to wash dishes. I am only 39. My MRI reads: The alignment is normal. Vertebral body marrow signal is benign throughout. There is a small Schmorl node type superior endplate defect at L2 centrally and a similar slightly smaller lesion at L3. The lesion at L2 has signal which suggests it may be relatively recent. T12-L1: tiny left paracentral disc protrusion minimally indenting the thecal sac without significant canal or foraminal stenosis . L5-S1: small central disc protrusion just abutting the ventral thecal sac without significant associated canal or foraminal stenosis. Can someone please explain some of this and what other options are there?","Doctor":"Hai, Thanks for writing in. Schmorl's node are nothing but disc protrusions inside your vertebral bodies. They are benign and usually don't cause any problems. After reading your MRI it seems there doesn't seems to be any significant findings. Small / tiny disc protrusions might be present for all individuals. Since there is no canal or foraminal stenosis, the pain is not a neurogenic / discogenic pain. Your MRI also didnt comment anything abnormal in your sacro-iliac joints. Sometimes spondylolysis at L5/S1 or any other levels can be missed by MRI. After a thorough clinical examination, you might need to undergo stress views of your spine +/- CT at the levels to rule-out any instability of segment or spondylolysis.

Thank you for any help and advice you can give.","Doctor":"Hi Cornerstone1, Back pain after lifting heavy weights is most likely due to a muscle or ligament tear / sprain. There is a possibility that there may be a disc prolapse also, but if you do not have any pain running down your thighs/ calfs or any numbness in any of your legs/ feet, the treatment remains the same in the initial period. Bed rest, heat therapy, light massage, pain medication for 2 - 3 days should relieve pain. Avoid bendin forwards, lifting heavy weights, sitting on floor, squatting. Gradual physiotherapy should be started as the pain settles down to train good posture and lifting practices. If the pain persists beyond three days/ pain running down the legs/ numbness or tingling sensation in the legs or feet, it would be wise to see your orthopedician/ spine surgeon. Get well soon."},{"Patient":"I was having severe lower back and went to doctor in XXXX and was given injection XEFO 8 MG INJ IV/IM.

Will this reduce the pain and numbness please suggest me.","Doctor":"Mr Shaikhfir, You have not mentioned the duration of the problem that you are having, but if the back pain has progressed to buttock and thigh pain and then to numbness in the right foot, it is highly likely that you have a nerve root compression in your lower back, most likely due to a disc prolapse. You must undergo an MRI to identify and confirm the level and reason of the compression. The medication should give you pain relief briefley but if the numbness and weakness in the foot and leg are increasing with time, it is wise to get an evaluation done by an orthopedic surgeon or spine surgeon as early as possible to prevent further progression of the neurolgical deficit.

As the pregnancy progresses, the heart and lungs in the chest cavity are pushed upwards and also there are a lot of changes that take place in the circulation and blood volume. the throbbing thet you feel in your left clavicle region may be due to the heart and big blood vessels moving upwards, which is normal for you.

From the details given by you it appears that you have a good excercise habbit. These are the points I can make out from the history given by you:Your back pain is most likely related to your sitting for long hours or some probable injury during excersise. It would be helpful to know if you have morning stiffness in the back lasting for an hour or longer, which gets better after excersise or walking around; or if the back pain runs down the back of thigh or leg on either side. If the back pain is severe and recent onset, you need to stop the back extension excersises for a while and see the respone.

Once your symptoms are reduced and under control you can join CORE STABILITY AND PILATES CLASSES under a supervision of a Physiotherapist....... Wish you a speedy recovery....."},{"Patient":"? Please ty Ive had backache for the past 3 months. I rested for a few days and I got a bit better but now it is terrible.

I need to have a look at the MRI report to know the cause of your pain. Only then can i suggest you regarding the further treatment required. However most of the back pains can be taken care of with the help of appropriate medicines and regular physiotherapy. I hope this information has been both informative and helpful for you.

Dorsal spine involvement is a common association of spinal tuberculosis or Pott's spine. If there is associated ongoing fever, reduced appetite, loss of weight or previous tuberculosis/tuberculosis exposure, tuberculosis is most likely. Blood counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, DNA PCR and montoux test are the initial set of investigations that would be needed. Other causes could be degenerative osteoporosis / tumour / secondary metastatic lesions. Bone scans will be able to differentiate and rule them out. Hope this information is helpful.

I cant sit . Since 3 days i am feeling pain in left leg also wats the solution . My height 180cm and weight 62kg","Doctor":"Hi, . As per your MRI scans, there are enough causes to explain the back ache. Now since you report worsening of pain and referral pain to the leg, I fear the condition may have worsened. Back problems such as yours are managed conservatively with help of analgesics, physiotherapy and rest. Intrathecal steroid injections are needed in some cases. When there is no improvement with conservative line of management or if there is worsening of complaints with neurological involvement, surgical treatment would be required. Hence I encourage you to visit a spine surgeon or neurosurgeon. A careful examination of spine, neurological examination and probably a repeat of scan might be needed. If the worst is suspected, you might need surgery. Else you may discuss about intrathecal injections and physiotherapy with them. Hope this helps. If there are any other information’s which you like to share, you are welcome. Regards"},{"Patient":"I have had terrible back pain for over a month. Nothing seems to ease the pain. It s mostly lower- but travels throughout the entire back quite often. My primary doctor told me to see a specialist. I am a 43 year old female and am very nervous about what this pain could be from. Any thoughts on what type of doctor i should see. Also, I haven t done anything that would have caused me to have such pain.","Doctor":"Hi, . At the age of 43, the most common cause of back pain is related to degenerative changes (osteoarthritis) and calcium deficiency. It is usually an association to menopause. I wonder if you menstrual cycles are normal or are you having other symptoms of menopause. Though I cannot predict the cause without a clinical examination, my bet would be on one of the 2 conditions. I suggest you to visit your orthopedic. Careful examination of the spine with multiple X-rays or CT/MRI scans of the back will reveal the true cause and its management. If the visit to the doctor takes time, you may try over the counter analgesics such as Advil 400mg twice a day after meal briefly for 3-5 days. Rest well and involve in physical exercise to strengthen the back. Calcium supplements can give you added benefits on the long run. Hope this helps.

A physiotherapist certified and experienced enough in Mc.Kenzie manual therapy techniques of spine will be the best person to take you out of your pain. Traction therapy is also helpful to reduce the radiation. Combination of Physiotherapy as mentioned above and some NSAID (non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs) (only in acute stage) and some nerve vitamin tablets give a significant relief in this case..

Since you experience pain at rest and not during activity this is not a case of mechanical disturbance/ irritation. As per your data scapula (blade) has no articular surface on the thorax. Scapulo-thoracic joint is known as a functional joint rather than an anatomical joint. So we can not think of any inflammatory arthritis as a cause of your burning pain. There is no bursae in that part of the body which could have been a case also. Since there is no complaints of lack of muscle control/ weakness, numbness, radiation there is no chance of neuropathic, nerve root irritation. There is no signs of vascular conditions also...... Hence Your burning pain is a cause of deficiency in vitamins/ minerals/hormones/calcium or frostbite..... So supplements rich in these things whether in natural form or in tablets would be more helpful for you. Wish you a pain free back soon..... have a nice day....."},{"Patient":"Dear Sir/Madame, I have a question for you. Namely, a week after I had unprotected sex, I started having pregnancy symptoms . First it started with headache, lower backpain , abdominal cramps (slightly similar to menstrual cramps), and very sore breasts (something I have never had before). After few days, I started having extreme fatique, lightheaded, dizziness , urinating more frequently, white creamy discharge, occassional pinching on my lower abdominal area, and acne all over my cheeks. I got my menstrual period exactly after 4 weeks, but it was much lighter than usual and I had normal bleeding for one night, where as the rest was coming and going through out the day and much lighter. After exactly 4 weeks I again got my period with the same pattern (I never get my period exactly 28 days apart two times in a row). I did quantative analysis of Beta HcG in what would have been 6th week gestatonial age (if I were pregnant ), and my B HcG was less than 1. In the meanwhile, my lower abdomen keeps getting bigger (I am very slender, and never have I had such bloated lower abdomen--my friends keep asking me if I am pregnant, since my lower abdomen is shaped in such a way that it looks as if I am pregnant; it is mainly bloated in the area where the uterus is located). Thus, my question (after such a long story) is: Is there any way I could be pregnant, given my B HcG results? And finally, I forgot to mention, I also did blood chemical analysis and the results showed that I have iron deficiency, but my red blood cells and hemoglobin were perfectly fine, and I had slight decrease in tryglicerides. Thank you for your answer! Kind Regards, Heather","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing to us. Since the quantitative analysis for HCG has shown a negative result and you are having regular periods, pregnancy is ruled out. The lesser than usual amount of bleeding that you are having can be due to iron deficiency. Your symptoms are non specific and do not conclusively indicate pregnancy.

Thereafter consult an orthopedic surgeon who will advise you accordingly."},{"Patient":"I am aged 48 suffering from lower back pain . I cloud not get up from where I was sitting on the floor.

Medicine taken Efetran, Ultracet, Benzaday15, PAN D for 10 day. I was quite comfort and do my regular work/travel etc. After a month the pain developed. The pain from lower back to foot , numbness at the foot etc. Pl advise.","Doctor":"Hello.Thanks for the question.This is most probably because of a pinched nerve or lower limb radiculopathy (Sciatica ). Common cause is bulging intervertebral discs in the vertebral column that compress on the nerves as they come out of the spinal cord. Symptoms are experienced along the area of distribution/path of that particular nerve. Xrays cannot be ideal to evaluate this so go ahead with MRI. Conservative treatment include anti-inflammatory medications, physical therapy or chiropractic treatment, and avoiding activity that strains the neck or back. The majority of radiculopathy patients respond well to this conservative treatment, and symptoms often improve within six weeks to three months. I guess conservative treatment are not proving helpful in your case. If patients do not improve with the treatments listed above they may benefit from an epidural steroid injection. With the help of an X-ray machine, a physician injects steroid medication between the bones of the spine adjacent to the involved nerves. This can help to rapidly reduce the inflammation and irritation of the nerve and help reduce the symptoms of radiculopathy. In some cases the symptoms continue despite all of the above treatment options. If this occurs and the symptoms are severe, surgery may be an option. The goal of the surgery is to remove the compression from the affected nerve. Depending on the cause of the radiculopathy, this can be done by a laminectomy or a discectomy. A laminectomy removes a small portion of the bone covering the nerve to allow it to have additional space. A discectomy removes the portion of the disk that has herniated out and is compressing a nerve. I would suggest you to see a spine specialist who will take into account severity of your symptoms and MRI findings to guide about the treatment. Thank you."},{"Patient":"i have lower back ache. but my bone disc and spinal cord everything normal. so please give me ur suggestion for me to relief from backache thank you..","Doctor":"hi shahul thanks for query i dont whether MRI been done or not if not done u should go for mri spine if its normal then probably this is due to severe paravertebral muscle spasm take the following advice of mine...... 1. pain killer ultracet/ TRDcontin 100 twice daily 2. thiocolchicoside 8 mg thrice daily 3. tizanidine 2 mg twice daily 4. hot compression locally 5. full rest until pain releived 6. consult a physiotherapist but anything is revealed on mri then do consult an orthopedic surgeon thank u"},{"Patient":"I have sharp middle back pain due to jumping.

You can take cervical traction, spinal mobilisation, neck extension exercises, then some pain relieving modalities like IFT/TENS/Ultrasound depending upon the clinical presentations. But since your B.P is low special attention to be given during traction force.

The place where they give the injection in the spine, that full area (horizontal) has severe pain. I cannot change my side while I sleep by early morning or sometimes cannot stand immediately after I wake up. Please recommend remedy. I am 37yrs old. thanks and regards, Lina","Doctor":"Hi Lina, Thanks for writing in. It is unlikely that the pain you are experiencing is due to the epidural anesthesia that you would have received during caesarean section. I would suggest the following: a. Start exercising. You need to be walking for 50 minutes daily for 5 days a week b. Lose excessive weight through a combination of diet and exercise c. Avoid forward bending and picking up heavy weights d. A MRI of the back ( particularly the lumbosacral region) would be needed to rule out  a process which is impinging on a nerve. I would suggest you see an orthopaedic surgeon at the earliest. This would be needed for a detailed examination and proper treatment.

I was placenta previa and had an emergency c-section which required a spinal block. I jumped when it was being administered so they had to go in again with a bigger needle. The next day I had a blood patch done due to fluid leakage from my spine.The spot was tender for almost a year. Since then my lower back pain has worsened. I am also now 2 inches shorter. Over the past two years I have developed shoulder and hip pain . This prevents me from sleeping most nights. I have also been experiencing horrible knee pain when I bend them. I am only 34. This is making it hard for me to even walk. Also when I rotate my hip I heaand feel grinding. Any advice?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for writing in. Since multiple joints are involved in your case, I seriously doubt that it is related to the delivery of your daughter. Although the low back pain may be related to a faulty posture, the first thing that we need to do is rule out an arthritis which could be involving several joints. The conditions I would like to rule out are rheumatoid arthritis, infectious arthritis and a seronegative spondyloarthropathy. I would suggest you see an orthopaedic surgeon at the earliest. We would need to run some tests and do a proper examination so that a proper cause can be found and treatment can be started.

History: My baby was large, over 9lbs the doctor thought he was going to be 15lbs. During labor (with no epidural ) I had a very hard time pushing him out, the nurse put a vacuum on his head (brand new at the time) and then hit the release button on accident and whoop there he went back inside... I pushed him out again... and OMG... the same thing happened... AGAIN! I had to push him out a 3rd time and the Dr finally used old fashioned forceps to get him out... he was born with a fractured collar bone and severe cone head. I noticed my back hurting shortly after delivery... I seen a Dr and went and got an xray around 6months post pardum... they told me they didn t see anything??? Then I gained ALOT of weight... and no Dr would take me seriously, they just chalked my low back pain up to my weight. Current situation: I have just coped and sucked it up... begging my husband to rub my back. 9 years ago I had the gastric bypass , lost weight and realized just how severely my rib cage has become disfigured, left side rib sticks out, right side con-caves in, I have tremendous constant shooting pains down my left hip, down my leg to my ankle , and extreme lower left sided back pain. I had an MRI 3 years ago... and Dr told me he didn t see anything... AGAIN! How can they not find what s wrong with me? I have been noticing everything getting worse, I also now have pain shooting down right hip and leg and my hands will fall asleep on occasion like when sitting at dining table level. My pain is so severe... I am to my end... I don t know what to do... I refuse to take pain meds other than ibuprofen... don t know what do... wish I at least knew WHAT is wrong!!!

I sincerely thank you all..","Doctor":"Working at a computer can cause back, neck and shoulder pains, headache, eyestrain and overuse injuries of the upper limbs. The risks can be reduced or eliminated with proper workstation design, improved posture, good working habits and REGULAR EXERCISE.Suggestions to reduce the risk of back pain:Use an adjustable desk designed for use with computers; position the monitor so that it is either at eye level or slightly lower.Position your keyboard at a height that allows your elbows to rest comfortably at your side. Forearms should be roughly parallel with the floor and level with your keyboard.Adjust your chair so that your feet rest flat on the floor.Use a footstool (if your feet do not rest on the floor when the chair is adjusted for good arm position).Switch to an ergonomic chair, which helps your spine to naturally hold its curve while sitting.Use an ergonomic keyboard to offer your hands and wrists a more natural holding position.Take frequent short breaks and go for a walk or perform STRETCHING EXERCISES at your desk. Stand often. Consulting a physical therapist (physiotherapist) for stretching exercises proper postural position than can surely help.Also get an X-ray of the painful region in the back to rule out any bony abnormality. Usually in computer users it should be X-ray cervical and Dorso-lumbar region with both AP & lateral views)"},{"Patient":"Hello doctors, my age is 25.plz tell me what type of treatment I have to take....

The pain in the left side of your abdomen could be due to gastritis caused by the possible intake of any pain killers consumed by you for the headaches, etc. If not , it could be due to any intra-abdominal inflammation for which a physical examination along with blood test like a CBC, LFT, serum amylase and serum lipase would have to be done, specially if you consume alcoholic beverages. Till then you could go for some anti spasmodic and a proton pump inhibitor drug. A word of caution on birth control pills: All the precautions including birth control pills are not 100% fool proof in protection against a pregnancy. If I were your doctor, I would also go for a serum HCG determination and an ultrasound abdomen to rule this out, and then consider your symptoms of breast pain, nausea and fatigue etc not to be due to a pregnancy, if these tests were negative. If positive,the whole management plan would change accordingly.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I was fine till about 2 years ago where i discovered shingles which was cured, it had recently come back so the doctor i went to said but was internal and nothing can be done about it. For the past month now i have been experiencing such pain in the lower right side just above my hip. i am not sure if this is shingles or if it could do with my back operation i had but i cant bare the pain anymore and dont know what to do. it actually feels like someone is stabbing me in the back with a knife.","Doctor":"Thanks for using Healthcaremagic. The symptoms described by you looks like a T12-L1 radiculopathy (pain in the distribution of the radicals). This can be due to various causes like early shingles before the vesicles appear, compression of the nerve either related to progressive scoliosis or surgery. T12-L1 radiculopathy is usually not caused by degenerative lumbar spondylosis. Consult a Neurologist or a Neurosurgeon and get started on medicines for reducing the neuropathic pain. If vesicles appear get treated for shingles again with antiviral medicines. Steroids should not be used as it increases the risk of shingles. I think this will guide you for further treatment.

Can you explian this condition more clearly. Thanks","Doctor":"Hello There. Welcome to healthcare Magic forum.. Lumbar spondylosis is a degenerative condition which affects the lower spine. In a patient with lumbar spondylosis, the spine is compromised by a narrowing of the space between the vertebrae, causing a variety of health problems ranging from back pain to neurological issues. Patient presents with numbness, tingling, and pain which seem to radiate out from the area. These symptoms are the result of pressure on the nerves as they exit the spinal cord. If the spondylosis is allowed to progress, it can lead to a narrowing of the spinal canal, resulting in impingement of the spinal cord, which can cause poor bladder control, unsteady gait, and other severe neurological problems.This condition is usually diagnosed by clinical features and X ray of the spine.

As per your info,this condition which you have is called coccydynia which simply means painful tail bone. This condition can become chronic if proper medication and precautions are not taken. Firstly you should always use padding around that area while sitting down. Avoid any form of injury or trauma to the area by continuous irritation of that area. Avoid sitting down in one position of too long. Consult with your physician who can prescribe you anti-inflammatory drugs and if necessary cortisone injections can be infiltrated locally to provide relief. The form on treatment depends on the status and severity of the underlying damage to the bone based on MRI report.  Hope this helps.

The spinal discs are soft cushions that rest between the bones of the spine, the vertebrae. When a disc is damaged, it may herniate against the spinal cord and spinal nerves causing Pressure symptoms like Pain, Numbness and Tingling sensation. The Treatment Options include, Oral medications, that is Analgesics, Narcotic pain relievers, Muscle relaxants or steroid Injections and Physiotherapy. In severe cases, where the conservative treatment fails, surgery will be considered like Discectomy, where the surgeon will remove just the protruding portion of the disk or the complete Disc Or your surgeon may suggest the implantation of an artificial disk. Kindly do not worry, as they are safe and the success rated are higher. Kindly consult your Orthopedist. Apply heat pads where you get more pain and avoid taking rest for more than 30 minutes in a position in which you are more comfortable and then go for a short walk or do some work.

The pain starts in the upper abdomin and moves around to my back and i feel great pressure on my chest.

I had many visits to the doctors who thought maybe it was acid so I started a treatment for that which did not help.

The ultra sound showed some stones in my gallbladded and i had it removed in March 2010. Thankfully the pains went away but started back again in December 2010. I got them maybe once every two weeks. after christmas things got a lot worse, i started getting the pains every day and every night, waking me from a deep sleep and sometimes causing me to vomit. I went to the emergancy room where i had bloods done and an ultra sound. everything came back fine. i then had a CT which also came back fine. followed by urine and stool tests and an MRI which also came back normal. finaly I had an EUS to check for stones in the bile duct which again, came back normal. the doctors are completely stumped and have now diagnosed me with IBS.

Horseshoe Kidney is a Congenital Urologic Condition which is the most common type of Kidney fusion anomaly and is usually found as a Incidental finding. Usually it is symptomless and in rare cases it causes abdominal pain and distension as a result of urinary obstruction, vomiting. It is a predisposing factor for formation of Kidney stones, which may be the cause of back pain in your case along with spinal muscle spasm, if at all stones are not present.

I m Sarah, 49, 5 5 , 9.5 stone. I have severe left shoulder blade pain, bad left shoulder pain, medium left arm pain, mild neck pain . This has been going on for 16 months and doctor has done nothing about it but had a private consultant appointment recently and have just got back results of NHS MRI scan, EMG and bone density scan. Bone density scan results excellent. The MRI results I have been sent give hardly any detail at all - just that I have mild to moderate degenerative spondylosis changes at C5/6. There is some associated narrowing of exit foramina . Also mentions minor chronic neurogenic changes and cervical radiculopathy. I have spent hundreds of hours reading about all of the above and have gained some understanding but surely I need to know exactly what these changes are ie osteophytes or bulging discs etc and also what degree of foraminal stenosis I have ? I am particularly worried by the foraminal narrowing and really need to know what to what degree this is present. I believe this was brought about by 7 months of repetitive stress injury - prolonged neck hyperextension and rotation. Now RSI has stopped for 7 months I have finally stopped getting shooting stabbing pains and now have a deep deep ache in shoulder blade and area above this. I have at most before this had a few days of backache in my entire life. Also relevant is that I hurt my arms lifting 5 years ago - my right one healed but my left didn t but I did not ever get any neck or back pain with this. Doctors visit really frustrating as I asked for more details and long term prognosis with foraminal stenosis and she just said that even she didn t understand all that jargon and I should not worry about that and just concentrate on coping with the pain. I pushed her on this and I said that there could be various reasons for the stenosis and she just said that it was probably osteophytes even though she only had the same letters as me. To add insult to injury she wasn t aware of any problem with my discs as she hadn t read the first letter properly! Just told me stenosis was incurable....in fact I knew more than her about it So what I need to know is 1 How do I get a full copy of radiographers MRI results 2 Any advice on foraminal stenosis....best treatments etc. I have been referred to pain clinic but this might take many months to come through and I cannot afford to go for treatment privately as I haven t been able to work since this happened and am well and truly on the breadline. 3 Any wisdom on what the mild to moderate degenerative spondylosis changes with associated narrowing of exit foramina is exactly? I think it is a disc bulge of some kind pressing on the foramen and not osteophytes but I could be really wrong. I really appreciate the kindness of anyone who gets back to me. I feel so alone with this. Putting up a really good fight not to succumb to depression with all this pain but occasionally the darkness gets through. Thank you again Sarah","Doctor":"Hi Sarah.. I couldn't help responding to your submission. I am not a doctor...however I am a patient that has suffered with cervical myelopathy, stenosis, radiculoapthy etc. I also have a brachial plexus injury along with a torn roatator cuff. I know the pain you are feeling - trust me. I can only share with you my experiences. The pain has kept me from working as well. It is quite frustrating...depressing...and gloomy. With that said, I did find pain relief with traction (manual and mechanical) at therapy. Also, I need to take Ibuprofen 800 mg and Vicodin 10 mg almost daily. The Ibuprofen helps me with the pain - while acting as an anti-inflammatory. The Vicodin is mainly for bedtime and helps with sleep sometimes. As far as pain management, it would be ideal for you to find a Dr. who not only deals with pain management, but is a psychiatrist as well. Cymbalta was prescribed along with Amrix (muscle relaxant) and I find them helpful. I don't know what state you are in....but there are always state or federally funded programs for those who cannot afford health care. Trust me...my wife worked as a social worker and people need to utilize these programs or the state or county will lose their funding. Now....the MRI'S...they are your films..period.

My mother is facing back pain and after conducting MRI scanning dr. has said that there is a nerve compression in L4 and L5, hence they are suggesting a operation. what can be done as an alternate to operation. Thank You","Doctor":"The first step in the treatment of low back pain is to rest the spine. Because most cases of back pain are due to muscle strain, it is important to avoid further irritation to the spine and the muscles that surroung the spinal column. Applications of heat packs help ease much of the discomfort associated with muscle spasm causing low back pain. Strengthening of back muscles is probably the most important step in treatment of most causes of back pain. Epidural steroid injections are an option for back pain treatment and inflammation around the spinal nerves. Spinal surgery is done when extensive efforts at conservative back pain treatment fails to relieve symptoms. The surgery of herniated disc is called Microdiscectomy or microdecompression spinal surgery.In carrying out the surgery, the small portion of the cartilage or the bone is removed under the nerve root. This relieves the neural impingement and more room for the nerve is thus provided. The nerve not only gets free from the thrust but also gets space for healing soon. Another form of surgery for herniated disk is called Percutaneous Microdecompression or Endoscopic Discectomy. In this form of surgery, lasers are used for shrinking the herniated disc. This is the most advanced form of spinal surgery that treats the patient without any cut or tear. There is enough evidence from clinical trials and data available from the past operations that surgery has proved ineffective in many cases. It is a proven fact that only one out of every 100 back pain cases is fit for surgery. The most startling revelation is that 67 % of low back pain surgeries became worse after surgery and 2/3 patients complained of more pain after the surgery. Also understand that back pain is often not a quick or easy fix. A dedicated approach to physical therapy and exercises often will alleviate back pain."},{"Patient":"Hi-dont know if anyone can help with this--- I was diagnosed 4 years ago with degenerative disc disease. Prio to the diagnosis I had an emergency c-section where there were complications, then 6 months later a LP to check for meningitis. Then diagnosed with DDD. I had 3 steroid injections, which were partially sucessfull. Then a tear later another set that had no effect. In February, I was admitted to hospital with suspected menigitis. I was told I would need a LP. My husband explained the complications with my back already and the doctor dismissed it. She proceeded to do the LP. It was horrendous! I had pain going up and down and across my entire body. I was screaming in agony. After ages of pushing, squeezing and wiggling whilst I was still screaming, she huffed and puffed and said that where she was trying to get the needle in had 'calcified'. She then said that she had to do it again. Yet again, same lightening strikes everywhere, until I begged her to stop. She kept saying, nearly there, nearly there, until finally, she managed to get the fluid out. I laid there shaking in agony, crying. My husband was told that he should go home and get some rest as I would not be moved now after that trauma. 20 minutes after he left, they said they were moving me to a ward. What they neglected to say was that the ward was 2 flights of stairs up and the lift was brroke! They then proceeded to push and pull me up the stairs! I have today returned to my doctor after still having so much nerve pain down my legs into my feet, an aching nerve pain in my left buttock which is all new and not subsided in any way. Added to that, I still have all the original back pain. My consultant has now ordered an MRI scan and a nreve test. He stated how unacceptable the wholeordeal was. He said there may have been damage from the LP-nerve or a bloot clot? I was too shocked to ask any more and wondered if you could give me any more details or tell me what the nerve test would involve? Many thanks to you in advance beverly","Doctor":"Hi, First of all the cause of your back pain is still not diagnosed. It could be due to the C section as well. Now with a difficult LP procedure it has got worsened. But LP does require more than 1 attempt on most of the occasions, it is a cumbersome procedure. So cant put the blame entirely on the doctor. For now the nerve test would be due to the  pain in the leg which you are experiencing right now. It is a electrophysiological test without any invasive procedure, so you can breath a sigh of relief. I wish you the best of health."},{"Patient":"I m in a Life or Death Situation. Could you PLEASE help me?

Your impairments have to render you unable to do any type of work.  The fact that you may be unable to perform the duties of your regular employment will not, by itself, qualify you to recieve SS disability benefits.  This is an important factor because the Social Security Administration will look at what you \\"can\\" do as well as what you \\"can't\\" do.  If you go into it saying well i could do a light job, if I could find one, you are essentially telling them that you are not disabled under their rules.  You have to have a disability or combination of impairments that prevent you from doing any type of work.  All that being said, how your hypertension, diabetes and spinal problems effect you (symptoms you experience that effect your ability to work) will determine whether you qualify.  Make a list of all of your symptoms and keep a diary of symptoms.  Be sure and report them to your doctor at every visit and don't forget to report any side effects of any medication you are taking, because this will be considered as well.  Hope this helps.

My 79 year old father is suffering from recurring hemorrhagic episodes due to radiation cystitis (radioactive seed implantation for prostate cancer 7 years ago). 6 weeks ago he had a clot which required a trip to the ER for catherization. Afterward he was fine. 4 weeks later his urologist performed a cystoscopy? Is that right? Scope of the bladder. Hence his radiation cystitis diagnosis. But it stirred everything up and that night he had another blockage. He kept the foley for 3 days, removed it, bleed for a few hours, then urine was clear - until that night - another trip to ER. 7 days later foley was removed. That was 3 days ago and he s had a little blood here and there, but clear for the past 24 hours. His urologist wants to conduct an ultrasound with him drinking 24 oz. of water in an hour. I m very concerned that s going to stress his bladder and cause the walls to bleed. The poor man just wants to go on an open ended trip to florida - camping along the way - just winging it. I don t think he should do this test. It s purely academic. Everything other than radiation cystitis has been ruled out and there s little he can do about that.

My name is Daniel, and I am seeking your professional advice and expertice. I am 21 years old, male, good health, fit, no smoking or excessive alcohol. I am experiencing low testosterone symptoms such as: no sex drive, ED, depressed mood, etc. My sex life is almost non-existent. I am 21 years old, and should not be dealing with problems like these. The blood work done with my doctor, all came back within the normal range, and my doctor tells me everything is like it should be, yet I don’t feel like it is. I have gotten a copy of my results and did some research online. Aberrantly my T-levels at 14,5 nmol/L (around 350-400 converted to ng/dl), are in the same range as an average 80 year old… My testosterone levels are not god for a guy my age, and far from optimal. So I went back to my doctor, but now she tells me my symptoms are caused by depression. I admit feeling depressed, but that is a result of my problems, depression is not causing them. And then she continued to prescribe me some Viagra… I am confident in saying that the symptoms I am experiencing are hormone/testosterone related, not psychological. My testosterone levels are low, but not low enough to get treatment, and thereby no chance to get sent of to an expert on the subject. So I am glad I found your internet service. What am I supposed to do? I cannot live like this, life feels so empty at the moment, and I don’t feel youthful at all… Some of my friends tells me that they can masturbate/have sex 3-4 times a day. Me, I need a two-day recharge time after just one “session”. Below are my results, please take a look at them, what do you think? Free T4      18.9 pmol/L 11.0 - 22.0 FSH 3.9 IE/L 1.0 – 12.0 Cortisol 577 nmol/L LH      9.7 IE/L      1.0 – 10.0 Prolactin 156 mIE/L      100 – 400 SHBG      18 nmol/L      15 – 85 Testosterone 14.5 nmol/L 9.0 – 35.0 TSH      0.66 mIE/L      0.30 – 4.2 Estradiol 0.09 nmol/L 00 – 0.16 Free Testosterone 7.1      3.0 – 14.7 I was hoping your profession on this subject could cast some light on my situation. Do you see anything out of the ordinary when looking at my blood test results? I am noticing elevated LH levels, along with the low testosterone, does this mean there could be something wrong with my testicles/leydig cells ? One guy told me that my pituary maby needed a kickstart. And that my T-levels would increase with the use of a drug like arimidex or clomid. To my understanding, these drugs work by increasing the LH levels, thus increasing testosterone. If my leydig cells where not responding well, trying this would be pointless? If possible, I would ask for a detailed response. Thank you in advance. Best regards Daniel","Doctor":"Hi, Low testosterone can be treated by hormone replacement therapy and assisted reproduction.

When ANA test positive doctors do another specific test called anti-dsDNA test. This test is specific for systemic lupus erythematosus. It is likely you do not have lupus if anti-dsDNA test came back negative. ANA test can be positive in healthy people as well or after using certain medicines or in infections. Besides other autoimmune conditions;  scleroderma, polymyositis and rheumatoid arthritis may also have positive ANA. Your low red blood cells and platelet is likely caused by low B12 level.

I had a miscarriage before i started on the depo shot. I had one shot & didnt like it so i switched to the pill after about 3 months of being on the pill I ended up in the ER with a PE in my right lung they weren t sure what has caused it im not the healthiest I m over weight and don t eat the best. But im not lazy, 2 weeks before this I had been given a promotion to be a Store Manager. So i was super stressed out but working 70 hours a week, & not just sitting at my desk so they ruled that wasn t the cause. So they assumed it was a mix of smoking & birth control & stress ,tho they still thought i was too young. So they started me on blood thinners kept me for 4 days & released me to be on Xarlto for 6 months. With follow up appts & to a specialist who had a bunch of blood test ran. Turned out I have a protein S deficiency & the pills triggered it. Now I m almost to my 6 month mark & my doctor told me that in order to continue any form of birth control I d have to stay on the Xarlto. My bf can t do condoms & we tried the pull & pray method ie the miscarriage. I m not sure yet if I want kids so I don t just want to completely cut that option out just yet & I m def not ready for one now & if or when I m pregnant I have to be on the blood thinners throughout the pregnancy. So either i stay on both pills or just stop having sex completely.... My main concern is staying on the blood thinners for a long period of time, it s been affecting my menstrual cycle the past 2 months & I still feel run down & tired alot of the time which i know is part of the clot. I m just wondering if I have another option in this. I don t mind the pill for the most part expect I m cold 24/7 now. Can u give me some advice plz?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.

High white blood cell count suggest an infection, any corticosteroid use, or bone marrow diseases.

His counts went from 1 on the 22nd to 9 on the 26th. On the 27 he was at 7 then given a nplate injection. He registered at 7 on the 30. We then discussed to gradually reduce the steroids and move to 6mp. We gradually reduced the steroids then on the 2nd his counts had increased to 16 before we started 6mp. Because I was cautious to start the 6 MP it was decided we would hold off on introduction to that drug but the ween from the steroids was still continued. When we returned on the 10th his counts had dropped all the way to below 5. Hesitant to introduce my son who is 2 months away from 4 to a chemo drug a doctor suggested to try another steroid at a higher dose for 4 days. It was also stated that after that round we would go back on the Prednisone to ween his system back down. On the follow up visit on the 13th his counts registered at 57 his highest since this had started. The doctor then suggested to just finish the last high dose and not move to Prednisone. He has had a nplate injection every week I should add. On the 16th his counts had dropped back to 5. Later that evening he had started to develop symptoms that made us go to the ER initially. Blood blisters on his lips and in his mouth , bruising, and spots of petechiae. All things we were told we should contact them about. We called and the just say to keep an eye on him and call if there s any bleeding. Am I missing something here?

Like infection, drugs etc. Infections should be ruled out. But as far as you have mentioned that you are taking aspirin, which is antiplatelet drug, so this may be the cause of your platelet count. You need to talk to your doctor about this and he /she can consider changing your medication.Hope i answered your query.  Feel free to ask for further assistance.

The count went down to 0 several years ago and was taken somewhere in Texas to be infused with a synthetic T-cell. It s very expensive and a long way from Ohio. How can I find any programs or trials at hospitals that may be working with this condition?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Yes,  low T-cell count can be treated but first of all its cause should be ruled out. E.g many viral infections, enteric fever, hiv etc, drugs like steroids, other immunosuppresent drugs, chemotherapy etc can decrease your count. So cause should be find out, and eradicating it will automatically result in increase these counts. You need to visit your physician for that. Also there are some drugs available like G-CSF which can boost the production of T-cell count. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"thanks.

Good afternoon. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. From the history of pain with PCOS, one could think of either a sudden hemorrageinto the cyst, or a twisting of the ovarian pedicle giving rise to such acute pain. This could be diagnosed by a physical examination supported with an ultrasound report at the time of the acute pain. Till then you could go for some anti inflammatory drug along with a proton pump inhibitor. Further management would depend on the report of ultrasound.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery.

If she is vomiting a lot just give her enough fluids to avoid dehydration and take her to the hospital. Unfortunately you cannot help much with her anemia at home, either. You should take her to a doctor.  Before treating the anemia a diagnostic workout should be done to find out the underlying cause. Anemia is simply low hemoglobin in the blood. But it could be caused by many disorders such as defect in hemoglobin production (vitamin, iron deficiency, or genetic hemoglobin defects) or red blood cell destruction in the body (autoimmune diseases, defects of red blood cells) or from the blood loss (usually from menstrual or gastrointestinal). If the cause is dietary iron deficiency or vitamin deficiency simply iron or vitamin supplements will help her anemia. Blood transfusion is not indicated in her case.

It is highly likely side effect of your medication (tasigna). Hypercalcemia may be side effect of your medicine, or from chronic myeloid leukemia or it can be caused by other disorders (endocrine, immune system disorders). Tasigna (nilotinib) is used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia. It may cause electrolyte imbalance including hypercalcemia. Patients taking tasigna should be periodically checked complete blood counts (CBC), blood chemistry and ECG. Hypercalcemia is also seen in accelerated phase and blast phases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Therefore, doctors check blast cells in the blood which shows what phase the diseases is and to monitor CML.  If blast cells less than 10%, no need to worry about accelerated phase and blast phases. In your case of hypercalcemia, the root cause needs to be determined. You may be ordered parathyroid hormone, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and parathormone related peptide.

She also has copd her sats are 75-83 she refuses the oxygen she had a fall 3 months ago broke humerous requried surgery then her eating got worse. They did discover through a CT that she had a previous stroke ( the fall I think) and dementia plus PAD","Doctor":"HiSerum potassium levels above 3.0 mEq/liter are not considered dangerous or of great concern; they can be treated with potassium replacement by mouth. Depending on the patient's medical condition, other medical problems, and the patient's symptoms, serum levels lower than 3.0 mEq/liter may require intravenous replacement. Decisions are patient-specific and depend upon the diagnosis, the circumstances of the illness, and the patient's ability to tolerate fluid and medication by mouth.Over the short-term, with self-limited illnesses like gastroenteritis with vomiting and diarrhea, the body is able to regulate and restore potassium levels on its own. However, if the hypokalemia is severe, or the losses of potassium are predicted to be ongoing, potassium replacement or supplementation may be required.In those patients taking diuretics, often a small amount of oral potassium may be prescribed since the loss will continue as long as the medication is prescribed. Oral supplements may be in pill or liquid form, and the dosages are measured in mEq (milliequivalents). Common doses are 10-20mEq per day. Alternatively, consumption of foods high in potassium may be the first option in replacing potassium. Bananas, apricots, oranges, and tomatoes are high in potassium content. Since potassium is excreted in the kidney, blood tests that monitor kidney function may be ordered to predict and prevent potassium levels from rising too high.When potassium needs to be given intravenously, it must be given slowly. Potassium is irritating to the vein and is usually administered at a maximal rate of 10 mEq per hour. Moreover, infusing potassium too quickly can cause heart irritation and promote potentially dangerous rhythms such as ventricular tachycardia.The body is usually able to maintain potassium levels within the normal range as long as there is adequate potassium in the diet. When the body loses potassium due to a short-term illness, the body is able to compensate for the loss. When the potassium loss is be ongoing, it is important for the patient and health-care professional to anticipate the loss, and consider routine potassium replacement.The most essential step in any treatment plan for COPD is to stop all smoking. It's the only way to keep COPD from getting worse which can eventually reduce your ability to breathe. But quitting smoking isn't easy. And this task may seem particularly daunting if you've tried to quit and have been unsuccessful.Talk to your doctor about nicotine replacement products and medications that might help, as well as how to handle relapses. Your doctor may also recommend a support group for people who want to quit smoking. It's also a good idea to avoid secondhand smoke exposure whenever possible.MedicationsDoctors use several kinds of medications to treat the symptoms and complications of COPD. You may take some medications on a regular basis and others as needed.BronchodilatorsThese medications which usually come in an inhaler relax the muscles around your airways. This can help relieve coughing and shortness of breath and make breathing easier. Depending on the severity of your disease, you may need a short-acting bronchodilator before activities, a long-acting bronchodilator that you use every day or both.RegardsDr De"},{"Patient":"I am 27 years old male.

Patients rarely are able to make their own diagnosis of a blood clot so the health-care professional will need to ask questions about what might be happening. If a blood clot or thrombus is a consideration, the history may expand to access the patient's risk factors or situations that might have put the patient at risk for forming a clot.Venous blood clots (venous thrombi) often develop slowly with gradual swelling, pain, and discoloration of the involved area, and the signs and symptoms will progress over hours.An arterial thrombus occurs as an acute event. Tissues need oxygen immediately, and the loss of blood supply as a result of an arterial clot creates a situation in which symptoms begin immediately.Physical examination will help add information to increase the suspicion for a blood clot.Vital signs are an important first step of the physical exam. Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation (what percent of red blood cells have oxygen attached to them) may provide a clue as to whether the patient is stable or in potential danger.Venous thrombi may cause swelling of an extremity. It may be red, warm, and tender and sometimes the physical exam may make it difficult to distinguish a venous thrombus from cellulitis or an infection of the extremity. If there is concern about a pulmonary embolus, the examiner may listen to the heart and lungs looking for abnormal sounds caused by an area of inflamed lung tissue, or unusual heart sounds.Arterial thrombus is much more dramatic. If an arm or leg is involved, the tissue may be white because of the lack of blood supply. As well, it may be cool to touch, and there may be loss of sensation and movement. The patient may be writhing in pain, but may not be able to move affected limb. Arterial thrombus is also the cause of heart attack, stroke, and ischemic bowel.Testing for venous blood clotsTesting will depend on the suspected location of the blood clot.Ultrasound: Venous blood clots may be detected in a variety of ways, although ultrasound is now most commonly used. Occasionally, the patient's size and shape may make it difficult for the ultrasound technician and radiologist to evaluate the deep veins of an arm or leg.Venography: Venography may be another alternative to look for a clot. A radiologist injects contrast dye into a small vein in the hand or foot, and using fluoroscopy (video X-ray) watches the dye fill the veins in the extremity as it travels back to the heart. This test is no longer commonly used, but may be available in certain select circumstances.Blood tests: Sometimes, a blood test is used to screen for blood clots. D-dimer is a breakdown product of a blood clot, and levels of this substance may be measured in the bloodstream. Blood clots are not stagnant; the body tries to dissolve them at the same time as a new clot is being added. D-dimer is not specific for a blood clot in a given area and cannot distinguish the difference between a \\"good\\" (necessary) blood clot (one that forms after surgery or due to bruising from a fall) from one that is causing problems. It is used as a screening test in patients with low probability of having a blood clot. In this case, if the result is negative, there is no need to search further for the diagnosis of blood clots.Additional tests: Should a blood clot embolize to the lung, this may be a medical emergency. There are a variety of tests to look for pulmonary emboli. A plain chest X-ray will not show blood clots, but may be done to look for other conditions that can cause chest pain and shortness of breath, the same sings and symptoms of an embolus. The electrocardiogram (EKG) may show abnormalities suggestive of a pulmonary embolus and may also show other reasons for chest pain.Computerized tomography (CT) is often the test of choice when suspicion of pulmonary embolus is high. Contrast is injected intravenously, and the radiologist can determine whether a clot is present.On occasion, ventilation perfusion (V/Q) scans are performed to look for pulmonary emboli. This test uses labeled chemicals to identify inhaled air into the lungs and match it with blood flow in the arteries. This test is less accurate than a CT scan and is subjective to variances in interpretation.Should a pulmonary embolus be diagnosed, the amount of clot and potential severity of the disease may require further testing. Echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart that may be used to decide how much strain the blood clot in the lung is causing on the heart.Testing for arterial blood clotsArterial thrombosis is an emergency, since tissue cannot survive very long without blood supply before there is irreversible damage. In an arm or leg, often a surgeon is immediately consulted. Arteriography may be considered. Arteriography is a technique in which dye is injected into the artery in question to look for blockage. Sometimes, if there is a large artery that is occluded, this test is done in the operating room with the presumption that a surgical procedure will be necessary to open the vessel and restore blood flow.For an acute heart attack, the EKG may confirm the diagnosis, although blood tests also may be used to look for enzymes (troponin) that leak into the bloodstream from irritated heart muscle. With an acute heart attack, the diagnostic and therapeutic procedure of choice is a heart catheterization. A catheter is placed into the coronary artery, the blockage identified and a stent placed to restore blood supply to heart muscle.Other variations of head CT may be considered to look at blood flow in the brain (perfusion CT) or the arteries themselves (CT angiogram).For an acute stroke (cerebrovascular accident, CVA), the test of choice is a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head to look for bleeding or tumor as the cause of stroke symptoms. If the stroke symptoms resolve, meaning that a transient ischemic attack (TIA) has occurred, tests may include carotid ultrasound to look for blockage in the major arteries of the neck and echocardiography to look for blood clots in the heart that may embolize to the brain. Continue ReadingWhat is the medical treatment for blood clotsDepending upon their location, blood clots may be aggressively treated or may need nothing more than symptomatic care.Venous thrombosis in the leg may occur in the superficial or deep systems of veins.Clots in the superficial system are often treated symptomatically with warm compresses and acetaminophen or ibuprofen since there is no risk for clots in the superficial veins to embolize to the lung. They are connected to the deep system by perforator veins that have valves that act like a sieve to strain and prevent clots from traveling to the lung.Deep venous thrombosis usually requires anticoagulation to prevent the clot from growing and causing a pulmonary embolus. Treatment tends to occur in an outpatient setting using medications that anticoagulate or \\"thin\\" the blood. There are a variety of medications available to treat blood clots.The American College of Chest Physicians has published guidelines regarding the type of blood thinners to be considered in the treatment of blood clots in the legs or in the lungs.In patients with DVT or PE and no active cancer, the drug of choice is a novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC), also known as a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) because of where they block the coagulation cascade to thin the blood.NOACs that block clotting Factor Xa include:apixaban (Eliquis)rivoroxiban (Xarelto)edoxiban (Savaysa)dabigatran is another NOAC that is a direct thrombin inhibitor.In patients with DVT or PE and active cancer, the recommended medication is low molecular weight heparin or enoxaparin (Lovenox).In unstable patients, or those where there is concern that they will become unstable in the near future, and who need hospitalization, the anticoagulation drug that is recommended is intravenous unfractionated heparin. When there is a large amount of blood clot in the pulmonary arteries, strain can be put on the heart and lung function and thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) drugs, so-called clot busting drugs, might be considered. These patients are usually critically ill and in shock.If there is massive amount of clot in the femoral or iliac veins, no blood may be able to leave the leg and it becomes massively engorged, swollen and blue. This is called phlegmasia cerulia dolens and may require treatment with tPA. Similar situations may occur in the arm with clots that form in the subclavian or axillary vein.Classically, warfarin (Coumadin) was most commonly used to treated blood clots. It is a vitamin K inhibitor and affects Factors II, VII, IX and X of the clotting cascade. Because it takes a few days to reach therapeutic levels, an injectable heparin product, (enoxaparin, fondaparinux) was also prescribed for the patient as a bridge to immediately thin the blood.Blood clots below the knee are at lower risk for embolization to the lung, and an alternative to anti-coagulation treatment is serial ultrasound examinations to monitor the clot to see whether it is stable or growing.Pulmonary emboli are treated similarly to deep venous thrombosis. In patients who have increasing shortness of breath or weakness, hospitalization may be required during the initial treatment phase. In certain situations, when there are large amounts of blood clot in the pulmonary arteries, strain can be put on the heart and lung function and thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) drugs, so-called clot busting drugs, might be considered. These patients are usually critically ill and in shock.Arterial blood clots are often managed more aggressively. Surgery may be attempted to remove the clot, or medication may be administered directly into the clot to try to dissolve it. Alteplase (Activase, tPA) or tenecteplase (TNKase) are examples of clot busting medications that may be used in peripheral arteries to try to restore blood supply.Heart attack: The same approach for heart attack is used as for arterial blood clots. If possible, cardiac catheterization is performed to locate the blocked blood vessel and a balloon is used to open it, restore blood flow, and a stent is placed to keep it open. This is a time-sensitive procedure and if a local hospital is unable to perform a heart catheterization emergently, within 60-90 minutes of the patient's arrival to medical care, thrombolytic medications described above like tPA or TNK may be used intravenously to try to dissolve the thrombus and minimize heart muscle damage. There will still be the need to eventually transfer the patient when stable to a hospital with the capability to perform heart catheterizations.Stroke also is treated with tPA if the patient is an appropriate candidate for this treatment. Each patient is different and may or may not qualify for this medication with an acute stroke. Again, this is a time sensitive emergency and in addition to tPA, an interventional radiologist may be able to insert a catheter into the blood vessels of the brain, identify the clot and remove it, thus hopefully reversing the stroke. This is how hip surgery can be done inspite of having blood clotting issues.RegardsDr De"},{"Patient":"I am 40 years old, 150 pounds, 5 10 .For the past ten years I have been to a doctor a couple of times a year to no avail. I am exhausted. So exhausted I can t take it anymore. I work 40 hours a week standing on my feet but i am certain this has nothing to do with it. Sometimes I am fine. I am in good physical shape and eat healthy. But suddenly I will be exhausted. For days. Sometimes weeks. Can barely get out of bed exhausted. I have had blood work done every year and nothing shows up. I drag myself through it all and most people wouldn t even know what I am going through. I go home and go to bed early every night just so I can work. I sleep all weekend. The only other symptoms I have are a permanently red chest (like sunburn, not itchy, not raised). Have had for 15 years or so. And dyshridosis on my left hand. Please help. I can t keep doing this. All I ever hear is CFS.","Doctor":"HiMost of the time fatigue can be traced to one or more of your habits or routines, particularly lack of exercise. It's also commonly related to depression. On occasion, fatigue is a symptom of other underlying conditions that require medical treatment.Lifestyle factorsTaking an honest inventory of things that might be responsible for your fatigue is often the first step toward relief. Fatigue may be related to:Use of alcohol or drugsExcess physical activityJet lag disorderLack of physical activityLack of sleepMedications, such as antihistamines, cough medicinesUnhealthy eating habitsConditionsUnrelenting exhaustion may be a sign of a condition or an effect of the drugs or therapies used to treat it, such as:Acute liver failureAnemiaAnxietyCancerChronic fatigue syndromeChronic infection or inflammationChronic kidney diseaseConcussionCOPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)Depression (major depressive disorder)DiabetesEmphysemaFibromyalgiaGriefHeart diseaseHyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid)Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid)Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)Medications and treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, pain drugs, heart drugs and antidepressantsMultiple sclerosisObesityPain that's persistentSleep apneaStressTraumatic brain injuryCauses shown here are commonly associated with this symptom. Work with your doctor or other health care professional for an accurate diagnosis.Since fatigue is a symptom of an underlying condition, the treatment depends upon the condition that is causing the fatigue, regardless of whether it is physical, psychological or a combination of the two.There may be a lag time between when the illness has been treated and the intensity of fatigue symptoms; some symptoms may resolve as soon as the underlying condition is treated. For example, individuals who are anemic feel much better as soon as their red blood cell count increases, while those recovering from infectious mononucleosis may require weeks to have their energy levels return to normalFatigue as a symptom can occur as the result of many causes and therefore, prevention is not an issue. More importantly, the early recognition of fatigue will allow a person to seek medical care and potentially have an earlier diagnosis of the underlying cause made.Sometimes, symptoms like fatigue arise gradually and it is difficult for the person to realize that there is a problem. It may take an outside perspective from a friend or family member to appreciate a difference in function. Self-awareness of gradual decline in body performance is often difficult as a person makes repeated small accommodations to complete daily activities.RegardsDR DE"},{"Patient":"Hi, My sons girlfriend mom is in the hospital with what they first thought was pneumonia, but now say is a blood infection.

He is scheduling her for tomorrow. Her 2 early 20 s daughters are the only ones that are there for her and have not met with the Dr yet. They have questions, as they should. A little back story.....she has had breast cancer in the past and has been on steroids recently for acute eczema ......which she has been suffering with for years. It has never been cured . Her skin is still discolored, thickened (alligator skin) and is rough, itchy, and inflamed. It bleeds with scratching - across her whole body. Any thing that you can say to help shed some light would be awesome. Thank you Thanks anyway.","Doctor":"HiEczema is often used as an umbrella term for a group of chronic, itchy skin rashes, a simple definition of the skin condition is hard to come by. Many people with eczema develop dry, itchy, red patches of skin. In some forms of eczema, blisters develop. Scratching can inflame the rash and cause “weeping” of clear fluid. Over time, the affected patches of skin can thicken. Eczema can look different depending on the type of rash and where it appears on the body. Symptoms typically flare up for a period of time and then calm down before surfacing again. More than 30 million Americans have some form of eczema. While the exact cause is unclear, a combination of factors, such as genes, environment, and immune system are thought to play a roleAtopic dermatitis is the most common form of the skin condition, and it’s usually what people are referring to when they talk about eczema. About one in five children develop atopic dermatitis, often in infancy and usually by age 5. (Only a small percentage of adults develop this type of eczema.)Dry, scaly, red, and itchy patches can appear on the face, scalp, hands, or feet; inside the elbows; or behind the knees. In more severe cases, these patches crack and crust over, and they can become infected. Atopic dermatitis comes and goes, with periods when symptoms are worse and other times when the rash goes into remission and disappears. It tends to occur in families with a history of this eczema, hay fever, or asthma. It can be a lifelong condition, although some children outgrow it or see symptom improvement as they age. Eczema is usually accompanied by uncontrollable itching that worsens when you scratch it and can interfere with sleep. People sometimes scratch until they bleed, yet itching persists, and the wound becomes vulnerable to infection.The signs and symptoms of eczema can vary from one person to the next.Atopic dermatitis, the most common type of eczema, usually strikes in childhood. Babies tend to develop a red rash on their cheeks and scalp that turns dry and scaly. The rash can bubble up, ooze, and crust over. In young children, other body sites may be affected, such as the inside folds of the elbows or knees, or the hands, wrists, or feet. Over time, these patches can lighten or darken, and they may become thick and bumpy and constantly itchy.Dyshidrotic eczema typically strikes the hands and feet. People with this type of eczema develop small, fluid-filled blisters that itch and burn. The blisters weep, crust over, and crack, exposing the skin to painful infection.There’s no single test for diagnosing eczema. Your doctor or your child’s pediatrician will conduct a physical exam. Some patients may be referred to a dermatologist or allergist. Doctors look for typical signs and symptoms of eczema, such as itching and rash.The difficulty is often ruling out other conditions that cause irritating skin symptoms. Atopic dermatitis, for example, may be confused with seborrheic dermatitis (a common condition that mainly affects the scalp), while nummular eczema may resemble ringworm (a contagious fungal infection). Sometimes a skin patch test or allergy test may be required to confirm an eczema diagnosis by ruling out other conditions.Expect your doctor to ask about your family history of allergic disease, since eczema can run in families. Kids with eczema can also go on to develop food allergy, hay fever (also known as allergic rhinitis), and asthma—usually in that order (this is sometimes called the “atopic march”).Tell your doctor when symptoms first appeared, how often you or your child experiences symptoms, other body parts that are affected, whether the problem comes and goes, and when it seems to flare up. Your doctor may ask about any allergies you or your child have and potential triggers of symptoms.Unfortunately, there’s no single magic bullet to get rid of eczema. But there are a number of treatments and strategies for relieving symptoms, reducing inflammation, and preventing flare-ups. These include ointments and creams that are applied to the skin, oral antibiotics or antihistamines, and an injectable medication.Restoring moisture is crucial for preventing symptom flare-ups. Soaks and wet wraps can soothe pain and itching. Prescription and over-the-counter moisturizers can help repair dry skin and keep it hydrated.Steroid ointments and creams have long been the go-to remedy to clear up eczema rash. These topical treatments (also called corticosteroids) can help reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms during a flare-up. But they are not recommended for long-term use due to serious potential side effects. Topical steroids come in different strengths, so if one doesn’t do the job, your doctor may switch to a more potent version.Newer non-steroidal medicines called calcineurin inhibitors are another option. These drugs include Elidel (pimecrolimus) cream for mild-to-moderate eczema and Protopic (tacrolimus) ointment is approved for moderate-to-severe symptoms.Eucrisa (crisaborole) ointment 2% is another option for eczema patients 2 years old and older. Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December 2016, Eucrisa inhibits an enzyme that promotes inflammation.The newest weapon against eczema, approved in March 2017, is Dupixent (dupilumab) for adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. It is administered as an injection under the skin and is intended for people whose eczema is not controlled by topical therapies or for whom topical treatment isn’t recommended. The active ingredient in Dupixent is an antibody that blocks a protein that causes inflammation.Light therapy (also called phototherapy) using a special device that emits ultraviolet light is an option for clearing difficult-to-treat eczema and rashes that are dispersed across the body.Topical products containing coal tar or antihistamines may be prescribed for itch relief.An antibiotic may be given to treat bacterial skin infections. Diluted bleach baths are sometimes used to treat baby eczema that results in frequent infections.

In most cases, ulcers heal within 3 months.Treatment usually involves:Removing dead tissue, called debriding the woundCleansing the areaDressing the wound with a simple, non-sticky bandageCompression bandagesOnce the ulcer is dressed, your nurse may apply a firm, compression bandage over the affected area. This puts pressure on your legs to encourage blood flow up towards your heart. Compression may involve two or three layers of bandages and is a skilled procedure that should be carried out by a trained person.Initially, this may make the area more painful and you may be given painkillers to manage the pain. Pain usually recedes as the wound heals, which can take up to 12 days. If the pain is too much for you, seek medical advice. If you get severe pain, or your toes turn blue, remove the bandage, and seek medical advice. You should also keep the leg elevated.In some case, people develop severe itching around the affected skin area. This can be an allergic reaction to bandages or ointments. It’s important not to scratch the affected area as this can make ulceration worse.Treating infected ulcersAs above, an infected ulcer should be cleaned and dressed, but you may have to avoid wearing a compression bandage until the infection has cleared.You may also be told to:Keep your leg elevated whenever possibleTake a course of antibioticsAntibiotics do not heal the ulcer. They are used to control the infection, so are usually only used in short courses.You are more at risk of developing a leg ulcer if you:Are elderlyHave varicose veins (swollen or enlarged veins)Have had a blood clot in the leg ( deep vein thrombosis DVT)Have had several pregnanciesStand for long periods of time in your jobYou have mobility issues like a leg fracture, obesity or paralysisYou’re recovering from surgery such as knee or hip replacementHave a history of leg ulcerationHave leg ulcer problems in the familyPreventing ulcersOnce you have had a leg ulcer, you are more prone to developing another one.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, I would advise you not to eat any food from outside if you do, specially fast, fried, oily and spicy food. Food from outside could bring on infections into your stomach which might become chronic and resistant to infection. So, I would advise you also for a routine stool test for ova and cyst, and treat it if positive. I would also try to rule out a chronic UTI (urinary tract infection) by a urine test (routine/microscopic/culture and sensitivity). If all these are negative,and you continue to have such kind of pain, I would advise you for a CT scan of abdomen, or for a diagnostic laparoscopy to rule out any intra abdominal pathology which might not have been picked up on ultrasound.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Seems like the two are coordinated. Should I wean down again as I m losing weight? *previously lost 33 pounds n went down 50 mg of betablockers*","Doctor":"HiFor the majority of people, reactive hypoglycemia usually doesn't require medical treatment. It may help, however, to pay attention to the timing and composition of your meals:Eat a well-balanced diet, including lean and nonmeat sources of protein, and high-fiber foods, including whole grains, fruits and vegetables.Avoid sugary foods, especially on an empty stomach.Be sure to eat food if you're consuming alcohol, and avoid using sugary soft drinks as mixers.Eat several small meals and snacks throughout the day, no more than three hours apart during the waking hours.Most people will try to find out what dietary changes are helpful for them to minimize the symptoms. For some, particularly those who have had stomach surgery (gastric bypass or surgery for the management of ulcer disease), further evaluation by a doctor may be warranted, but dietary changes are still recommended and very important.It's also important to include physical activity in your daily routine. Your doctor can help decide what's right for you."},{"Patient":"my daugther has the following symptoms Anemia Loss of appetite Gluten intolerant Soy intolerant dairy intolerant Gastro paresis Acid Reflux Migraines Nausea Vomiting Hair shedding excessively when combing or even just washing Abdominal pain Joint pain Shortness of breath Pelvic pain Back pain Upper abdominal pain Chest Pain Fatigue Weakness Can t sleep, If I do sleep I don t sleep well Lightheaded Dizziness Usually cold especially in fingertips Sudden sleepiness Neck Stiffness Back stiffness Brown urine or dark urine What should we considering","Doctor":"HiAfter hearing your history i would advise you to treat anaemia with    iron supplements and making changes to your diet.If the underlying cause of iron deficiency is loss of blood — other than from menstruation — the source of the bleeding must be located and stopped. This may involve surgery. Treatment for folic acid and B-12 deficiency involves dietary supplements and increasing these nutrients in your diet.If your digestive system has trouble absorbing vitamin B-12 from the food you eat, you may need vitamin B-12 shots. At first, you may receive the shots every other day. Eventually, you'll need shots just once a month, which may continue for life, depending on your situation.For loss of appetite:you have to dothe following testan ultrasound of your abdomena complete blood counttests of your liver, thyroid, and kidney function (these usually require only a blood sample)an upper GI series, which includes X-rays that examine your esophagus, stomach, and small intestinea CT scan of your head, chest, abdomen, or pelvisIn some cases, you will be tested for pregnancy and HIV. Your urine may be tested for traces of drugs.If your decreased appetite has resulted in malnutrition, you may be given nutrients through an intravenous line.Your doctor may also prescribe oral medication to stimulate your appetite.Your doctor may refer to you to a mental health specialist or counselor if your loss of appetite is a result of depression, an eating disorder, or drug misuse.Loss of appetite caused by medications may be treated by changing your dosage or switching your prescription. Never change your medications without first consulting your doctor.If your decreased appetite is caused by a short-term condition, you’re likely to recover naturally without any long-term effects.However, if your decreased appetite is caused by a medical condition, the condition could worsen without treatment.If left untreated, your decreased appetite can also be accompanied with more severe symptoms, such as:extreme fatigueweight lossa rapid heart ratefeverirritabilitya general ill feeling, or malaiseIf your decreased appetite persists and you develop malnutrition or vitamin and electrolyte deficiencies, you can have life-threatening complications. Therefore, it’s important to seek medical attention if you have anorexia that does not resolve after an acute illness or that lasts longer than a few weeks.For your severe hair loss you ca treat it with Minoxidil (Rogaine) 5% is the only topical medication approved by the FDA for female-pattern hair loss. The once daily use foam treatment regrows hair in 81% of the women who try it.

Now the Hep C is gone, but she continues to internal bleeding. Three or four bouts of this since August. Doctors can not find where the blood is coming. They have cauterized a couple of small Variocese but this keeps happening. The most recent on Friday, they could not find any reason for the blood. Did Endoscopy and CT scan and no leaks. But she throws up pure blood. What could be causing this???","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for asking on Healthcaremagic. Hepatitis c treatment would not cause bleeding. However an underlying liver ailment might. Liver produces coagulation factors and impaired liver function can lead to bleeds. Also portal hypertension associated with liver disorders can lead to enlarged veins in lower end of esophagus leading to bloody vomiting. I think consult a gastro enterologist. He might just do an endoscopy to see what's wrong and treat it. Thanks."},{"Patient":"My fathers blood test shows reduced RBC and hemoglobin slightly below normal range, and elevated MPV. He had a heart attack 6 months prior. He is a non smoker, non drinker, average weight, and actively exercises. What could this blood test indicate and what should he do?","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for asking on Healthcaremagic. The blood report indicates mild anemia. Kindly look up the Mcv mch indices in the report. In case of iron deficiency these are low. In case if folate or b12 deficiency these might be high. You might have anemia of chronic disease in which these indices are normal. You can get serum iron folate and b12 tested. Increased mpv implies that the average size of your platelets is slightly high. It is no concern to worry and indicates an active bone marrow producing platelets. So I think nothing very serious with the report. Can take haematinics to improve hb though. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hello I have sickle cell anemia and I went to the hospital last week and while there was told that my white cell count is too low and to hold my medicine called hydroxyurea. I want to know is there anything I can do to help boost it or get it back to normal?","Doctor":"HiSickle cell anaemia disease usually requires lifelong treatment.Children and adults with sickle cell disease will be supported by a team of different healthcare professionals working together in a specialist sickle cell centre.Your care team will help you learn more about the condition and work with you to come up with an individual care plan that takes into account all your needs and health concernsThe main thing you can do to reduce your chances of experiencing a painful episode (sickle cell crisis) is to try avoiding possible triggers.This may mean you need to:drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydrationwear appropriate clothing to stop you getting coldavoid sudden temperature changes, such as swimming in cold waterIf you continue to experience episodes of pain, a medication called hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) may be recommended. This is usually taken as a capsule once a day.Hydroxycarbamide can lower the amount of other blood cells, such as white blood cells and platelets (clotting cells), so regular blood tests will usually be recommended to monitor your health.If you experience a sickle cell crisis, you can usually manage it at home. The following can help:take over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen (aspirin should not be given to children under 16) – if the pain is more severe, your GP may prescribe stronger painkillersensure you have plenty to drinkuse a warm towel or a heated pad to gently massage the affected body part – many pharmacies sell pads that can be used for this purposetry suitable distractions to take your mind off the pain– for example, children might like to read a story, watch a film or play their favourite computer gameAnaemia often causes few symptoms and may not require specific treatment.However, dietary supplements such as folic acid (which helps stimulate the production of red blood cells) may sometimes be required to help improve anaemia if your child has a restricted diet, such as a vegetarian or vegan diet.Anaemia caused by sickle cell disease isn't the same as the more common iron deficiency anaemia. Don't take iron supplements to treat it without seeking medical advice as they could be dangerous.If anaemia is particularly severe or persistent, treatment with blood transfusions or hydroxycarbamide may be necessary.RegardsDR DE"},{"Patient":"my daughter had a severe campylobacter infection 6 years ago. it took over 6 weeks to be diagnosed and she was hospitalized for significant weight loss and dehydration. since that time she has frequent spells of illness associated with central vertigo / vomiting / nausea. incapacitating sometimes weeks at a time. she is now 29 years old. she was told the infection had spread to her bloodstream and is affecting her cerebellum which is the reason for long term vertigo. is there any treatment ?? also she has low WBC consistently after this illness, even when feeling somewhat well. any suggestions ?","Doctor":"HiA low WBC count is usually discovered by your physician or health care provider during routine testing or through the course of diagnosis and treatment for an underlying disease, disorder or condition. A normal WBC count is approximately 4,500 to 10,000 WBCs per microliter of blood. A low WBC count is generally below 3,500 WBCs per microliter of blood, but this number varies depending on the medical laboratory, the particular test used, and the individual medical practice.The significance of a low WBC count varies and may be more (or less) serious depending on your medical history, overall health, and the underlying disease, disorder or condition. Some people may naturally have a mildly low WBC count. The normal range of low to high WBC counts also varies by age and gender.A low WBC count is often linked to problems with the bone marrow and the inability to make enough white blood cells. Autoimmune diseases that attack your white blood cells can also lead to a low WBC count. Several different prescribed drugs, including chemotherapy, are known to decrease WBC production or destroy WBCs.A low WBC count can be serious because it increases your risk of developing a potentially life-threatening infection.  If you have a low WBC count, you will probably be advised by your medical professional to avoid situations that expose you to infectious and contagious diseases. Seek prompt medical care if you have a low WBC count and have signs of an infection, such as a fever, swollen lymph nodes, sore throat, or skin lesions.A low WBC count can be due to a variety of different conditions that either destroy WBCs or inhibit their production in the bone marrow. These include:AIDSAplastic anemia (condition in which the bone marrow makes insufficient blood cells)Bone marrow disease (myelodysplastic syndromes)ChemotherapyLeukemiaLiver disease (hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver failure)Overactive spleen that destroys white blood cellsRadiation exposureRheumatoid arthritis (chronic autoimmune disease characterized by joint inflammation)Systemic lupus erythematosus (disorder in which the body attacks its own healthy cells and tissues)RegardsDR DE"},{"Patient":"My son had aortic valve replaced 3 years ago.about 10 days ago he came down with flu like systems..fever bad backache chills..r Finally took to hospital and the next day he was told that he had bacteria in the blood Has been in hospital since last Saturday..","Doctor":"HiBacterail infection in blood can be treated by the following wayIn almost every case of sepsis, patients need to be hospitalized, treated with appropriate intravenous antibiotics, and given therapy to support any organ dysfunction. Sepsis can quickly cause organ damage and death; therapy should not be delayed as statistics suggest as high as a 7% mortality increase per hour if antibiotics are delayed in severe sepsis. Most cases of sepsis are treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) of the hospital by critical care medicine specialists, infectious disease specialists, and others as needed.Appropriate antibiotics to treat sepsis are combinations of two or three antibiotics given at the same time; most combinations usually include vancomycin to treat many MRSA infections. Some of the commonly used antibiotics used areceftriaxone (Rocephin),meropenem (Merrem),ceftazidime (Fortaz),cefotaxime (Claforan),cefepime (Maxipime),piperacillin and tazobactam (Zosyn),ampicillin and sulbactam (Unasyn),imipenem/cilastatin (Primaxin),levofloxacin (Levaquin), andclindamycin (Cleocin).However, once the infecting organism is isolated, labs can determine which antibiotics are most effective against the organisms, and those antibiotics should be used to treat the patient. In addition to antibiotics, two other major therapeutic interventions, organ-system support and surgery, may be needed. First, if an organ system needs support, the intensive care unit can often provide it (for example, intubation [mechanical ventilation] to support lung function or dialysis to support kidney function) or a central venous catheter and fluid replacement with intravenous fluids and/or antihypotensive medication to raise blood pressure (norepinephrine [Levophed] or phenylephrine [Neo-Synephrine] administered by IV). Secondly, surgery may be needed to drain or remove the source of infection. Amputation of extremities has been done to save some patients' lives.RegardsDR DE"},{"Patient":"Is there any research that points to the use of Saw Palmetto as an anticoagulant for AF therapy?

The goal of phlebotomy is to keep the hematocrit around 45% in men and 42% in women. Initially, it may be necessary to do phlebotomy every 2 to 3 days and remove 250 to 500 milliliters of blood each session. Once the goal is reached, maintenance phlebotomy can be performed less frequently.A commonly recommended medication for the treatment of polycythemia is called hydroxyurea (Hydrea). This is especially advised in people at risk of clot formation. At age greater than 70, having both an elevated platelet count (thrombocytosis) greater than 1.5 million and cardiovascular disease makes the use of hydroxyurea more favorable. Hydroxyurea is also recommended in patients who are unable to tolerate phlebotomy. Hydroxyurea can lower all elevated blood counts (WBC, red blood cells, and platelets), whereas phlebotomy only lowers the HCT.RegardsDr De"},{"Patient":"Hi, I once had a hemoglobin number of 5.6 after surgery and they gave me 10 units of blood and the number went up to about 8.5.

From the history that you have given, it is not quite clear if your hemoglobin levels were decreased prior to surgery or after surgery. Also, only low hemoglobin levels by themselves are not always the criteria for inpatient therapy and a hemoglobin of 8.5 is quite compatible with discharge.

In case he has Only low Leucocyte counts, then the vomiting and diarrhea could be caused by an infection in his tummy. In case of people with low white cell counts, even minor infections can rapidly spiral out of control. So he needs to be treated for diarrhea with antibiotics. Then again if he has passed out once, then you need to be sure that he does not have low hemoglobin levels because that can mean that he needs a transfusion. Once you get him stabilized out of the infection, he needs to be investigated for the cause of his low counts. Maybe, a Hematology consult will help."},{"Patient":"Hello.

My blood pressure is now in the range of 120 to 125 over 75 to 79 but my iron levels are super low what do you advise? Should i maybe change the time i take feramax? I usually take it in the afternoon and the coversyl first thing in the morning on an empty stomach.","Doctor":"Hi,There are two aspects to your question. Firstly, Coversyl is NOT causing your anemia. Secondly, if you are having a low Hemoglobin and low Iron levels, you need to be on Iron supplements and get yourself checked for the cause of low Iron.Regards,Dr. Arijit Nag"},{"Patient":"68 yr old white male. My hematocrit dropped suddenly 4 years ago, from 42 to hovering around 31. Cells are not maturing. Endoscopy, colonoscopy and bone marrow were negative. Generally healthy. Not symptomatic. Exercise regularly. Not low enough for transfusion therapy. No kidney disease. Iron is abundant. O2 saturation 97%. Is there a protocol to stimulate red cell production/maturity?","Doctor":"Hi,This is a tricky situation. You may actually be having a maturation defect or a myelodysplastic syndrome. Needs a repeat BM Aspiration, Trephine Biopsy with Cytogenetics and a few other tests (FISH/PCR-based). Once we have ruled that out I think we can observe your counts at a certain interval to know the trend of your blood counts.Hope this helps.Regards,Dr. Arijit Nag"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am g6pd deficient and I didn t know ascobic acid was a red flag for me. I was taking ascobic acid 1000mg once a day and a few days down the line I started experiencing severe anaemia. I am also currently in Africa and I am still not feeling so strong after taking iron pills 2 times daily and one a day for women tablets daily. Though it s better than before but I still have the symptoms. What should I do? I have already gone to the Hospital and all labs prove that my haemoglobin level is not so bad.","Doctor":"HI. I am glad that we connected. Ascorbic acid is also known as vitamin C. It is not a complete contraindication for anemia or G6PD deficiency. It is possible that one may develop some symptoms because of the oxidative stress on the body. Usually, G6PD deficiency is treated by avoiding medications that can cause increased oxidative stress. The rest of the treatment is managed by maintaing the iron levels, reducing exercise that can cause low oxygen levels, and avoiding excessive stress.Some doctors find using folic acid useful as well. Some cases may require blood transfusion.I hope this works out for you! All the best."},{"Patient":"Dr. Rynne,  I'm 49 years old and recently diagnosed anemic. I'm having extreme numbness in my arms when I hold hold objects for extended periods of time including driving. Iron supplements have uncomfortable side effects.  Any suggestions to what else I can do to get more iron?","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for asking on Healthcaremagic. Kindly get your peripheral blood film done to check out whether you have anemia due to iron deficiency or vitamin b12/folate. Accordingly numbness might indicate b12 deficiency. Better to take all supplements together for optimal benefit. You might have anemia due to other causes like haemolysis or occult blood loss. Also if you cannot tolerate a specific salt of iron, try to change the salt. Ferrous sulphate, ferrous fumarate, ferrous carbonate there are many salts. Consult your doctor. Mostly the side effects of iron resolve after taking it for few days continuously. Moreover include sources of iron in diet like red meat, spinach and green leafy veggies. Jaggery is also a good source and good as a dessert after food in case you are not a diabetic. In case still oral iron is not tolerated you can go in for injectable iron. Hope I helped.

MY DOCTOR KEEPS CHANGING DOSE OF WARFRAN. ANY HELP ON THIS ISSUE WOULD BE GREATLY WELCOMED. THANK YOU, JIM ALLIGER","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for asking on Healthcaremagic. Titration of warfarin dose is very tricky. INR levels seem to fluctuate with mild modifications in diet and associated drug intakes. Also the warfarin tablet is supposed to be taken same time daily and sample given at a same time every time. Anything from 2-3 INR is good for anticoagulation. Lower will be ineffective and higher might cause bleeds. Sample should be given at a good laboratory and sampling errors can change INR. If needs to be transported then plasma needs to be separated and frozen immediately to be transported. All in all a delicate test.

My headaches are horrible when they randomly hit. I ve been having these symptoms for months now. I m a 19 year old female and shouldn t be having these problems, please help me find some type of answer, or lead me in the right direction.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for asking on Healthcaremagic. Your wbc count is slightly low. Normal ranges are from 4-11 thousand per cubic mm. Now what was the reason you visited the Healthcare facility? Wbc commonly lowers in transient viral infections. Viral gastrointestinal infections could be a cause. However often the count rises to normal values few days after the infection has resolved. However other causes of leucopenia are overwhelming bacterial infections, long term use of certain drugs, bone marrow aplasia to name a few. In these cases the wbc count remains low for long periods of life. Better would be to get yourself tested again after 20-30 days. Most probably your transient leucopenia might have resolved by then. If still not resolved then you ll have to consult a haematologist to look for underlying causes.

Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If If were his doctor, after a personal physical examination of his abdomen, I would have advised for an ultrasound of the abdomen to rule out any intra abdominal organ pathology. I would also advise him not to eat from outside if he does as intestinal infections might creep in through outside food. Some routine tests like stool for ova and cyst, urine routine/microscopic and blood test (CBC) might also aid in making the diagnosis. Till then he might go for some anti spasmodic drug along with a proton pump inhibitor for a symptomatic relief. Further management would depend on reports of the investigations.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

My protein levels good, negative CHF, only problems from blood test show Glucose 205 (they said probably due to steroids) and my white blood count is high. I didn t get to talk to the doctor - and person I spoke too was not helpful. What could be cause for elevated white blood count & should I be watching for anything in particular?","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for asking on Healthcaremagic. Elevated wbc count is leucocytosis. Leucocytosis is caused mostly due to infections. Bacterial infections might cause neutrophil fraction of wbc to rise and hence total wbc count increases. Viral infections cause lymphocytes to increase. Inflammatory conditions also raise wbc count. It is probably due to your underlying condition and was masked due to water retention earlier and is unmasked by water loss by Lasix. It will resolve after your infection is controlled.

I am a bit curious if I should worry about it since I’m on warfarin. I’ve got a machenical heart valve and they always worry about bruising. Do I just tape it up or see a doctor?","Doctor":"Hi.I am glad you reached out. An injury to the toe can cause the toe to start swelling. This happens because the toxins from the toe release and there is swelling in the toe after this. This can cause some clotting to be seen. However, the toxins cause the blood vessels to be more leaky. This makes the swelling start quicker. Usually, I find these things useful for the swelling -Icing the areaUsing a local painkiller gelTaking over the counter painkillersRaising the leg while sleeping to get the blood flow back to the heartI hope this helps you.

Her numbers this last year have been between 15.8 and 19.3","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for asking on Healthcaremagic. Polycythemia is persistent increased rbcs and hence increased hemoglobin levels in the blood. It could be primary ie Vera or secondary to certain causes. Polycythemia Vera has low erythropoietin levels and on cytogenetics Jak2 mutation is found. In secondary Polycythemia underlying causes may be those causing chronic hypoxia which increase erythyopoietin production like sleep apnea, obesity hypo ventilation syndrome, copd, testosterone replacement therapy, smoking etc. Epo secreting tumors like hepatocellular CA, renal cell CA, adrenal adenoma could also cause it. High rbc count causes blood flow to be sluggish in brain and other essential organs causing symptoms like impaired alertness, dizziness, headaches, thrombosis, stroke, myocardial infarction, DVT. It is essential to find out the underlying cause and treat it to relieve secondary Polycythemia. Hope the doctor has checked erythyopoietin levels before labeling it as secondary. Otherwise regular blood removal is advised to keep hb from rising too much. Kindly look for a cause and treat it.

Thanks for asking on Healthcaremagic. In case you are not taking any pain killers for arthritis then it is unlikely that the low iron is due to arthritis. Low iron can occur due to gastritis caused by pain killers. It is advisable to start taking iron tablets daily so that iron levels increase to normal. Kindly follow up with your serum iron tests and start taking iron rich foods. In case it does not normalise after intake too then it might be malabsorption and it's better to take injectable then.

Low iron reserves and low serum iron can be due to decreased intake in diet, reduced absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, or due to increased loss from the body via some occult bleeding. Include iron rich foods like green leafy vegetables in your diet. Jaggery is a good source of iron which can be taken after food. Make sure you do not suffer from any kind of malabsorption which might be leading to reduced absorption. If yes then direct your approach to treating that malabsorption. And go in for tests like stool occult blood and urine microscopy to rule out any blood loss. If hemoglobin is also low then it is advisable to start using iron supplements in form of tablets. Kindly be informed that iron will not get absorbed well if taken along with calcium as they form chelates.

Judy","Doctor":"Hey Judy,As far as White Blood Cells in urine are concerned it means you are having active urinary tract infection.And iron replacement therapy is not recommended during an ongoing infection.So I would suggest you to take a break in your routine iron replacement therapies.Regards"},{"Patient":"Just had a routine test for work Health Screening and my white blood cell count was 2.9 (low), it was same last year.I feel great.

Thank-you","Doctor":"Hi there,what are the other parameters in hemogram? 2.9 wbc count is not something which can be neglected. You have to be evaluated to know the reason for low wbc count. If none is found, then there is no need to worry.Hope I have answered your question. Don't hesitate to ask any clarifications.

Do I need any further evaluation and treatment? South indian with south indian diet habits","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for asking your query on HealthcareMagic. I have gone through your query. Both values of Random blood sugar and Total cholesterol levels are on a higher side, though near normal range. It has been studied that South Indian dietary habits also increases the risk of diabetes and high cholesterol. Considering this, I would suggest you adopt some lifestyle changes to keep the cholesterol and sugar levels in control. Exercise daily (at least brisk walking for 45 min) and keep a control on your weight. Avoid oily and spicy foods. If you do not have any health complaints, get regular heart checkup, ECG and treadmill test done and let me know the reports. I hope I have answered your query.

The nurse practitioner didn t seem too alarmed but she wouldn t let me leave until it came down to the final reading","Doctor":"hi. Good to see your concern about your health. So far as your question is concerned, with the information provided there may be  many causes of increased blood pressure with most important being the age itself. Moreover, additional environmental and psychological conditions like exertion or anxiety may increase the blood pressure momentarily. That may be the scenerio in your case while ariving to the physician office you might have had a walk or may be gone upstairs. Additionally in such a settings, a little bit of anxiety may also be there. In such conditions i advise my clients to record their B.P twice daily for atleast a week. then come up with the B.P record to the physician for appropriate further action as a single reading or few readings taken in a short while is not the indication for antihypertensive therapy unless its to high that it necessitates urgent action. I hope these words might help to better understand your health status.Wishing you the best of health.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi!

One month back ( 19 october, 2010) she was affected with Viral fever and we consulted a Gynae Doctor ( as we were trying for a second baby) . The Lab results are as below : Haemoglobin – 12.8 G/DL ; WBC count – 10200 Cells/U; Neutrophils – 80%; Lymphocytes – 15%; Eosinophils – 02 %; Monocytes – 03 %; Basophils - -% ; ESR – 40MM. The Gynae Doctor prescribed her NEOMOL CF tablets and Finallerg 10 mg tablets . After taking this for one week her fever was cured but her ears got blocked . We again went to the Gynae Doctor and Doctor adviced her to do some exercise ( like close the nose and push air oustside from mouth) so that blocked ears will open and also to inhale vapour from a nebulizer) and prescribed her NEOCLAV1 g. Still after a week it was not cured and she was suffering with a Buzzing sound from her left ear. Then we consulted an ENT Doctor and the Doctor checked her ears and prescribed her BETASONE (corticosteroid), Clarinaise ( Loratadine 5 mg, Pseudoephedrine Sulphate 120 mg) tablets . After one week the buzzing sound was little bit cured but she was feeling heaviness on her ears ( like pressure coming inside to her left ear ) . As this was not getting well we consulted another ENT Specialist doctor and doctor checked her thoroughly after inserting some equipment in her both ears . The test results are : Left Ear: Peak YA 0.4 mmho ; GR (width) 100 dapa; TPP       -10; Vea(+200) 0.8cc Right Ear Peak YA 0.4 mmho ; GR (width) 95 dapa; TPP       -20; Vea(+200) 0.8cc Then Doctor referred for a Audio Test and mentioned that she cannot hear the minor sounds 50% in her left ear ( I will forward you the audio test after scanning if required) . Then the Doctor prescribed her the following medicines : BETASERC 16 mg 60’ S – 10days ( 1-0-1); FIXIT 300 mg CAPS 14’s – 7 Days ( 1-0-1) TRENTAL 400 mg TAB 20’- 14 days ( 1-0-1) , LOVIR 800 TAB 50’s – 7 days ( 1-1-1-1-1) GUPISONE 5 Mg TAB 20’s (4-4-4 for 4 days); (3-3-3 for 4 days); (2-2-2 for 4 days) ; (2-0-2 for 3 days) ; (1-1-1 for 3 days) ; ( 1-0-1 for 3 days ) ; ( 1-0-0 for 3 days) Now she is taking only Gupisone as the other medicines which were prescribed already finished the dosages. After one week she discontinued the TRENTAL tablets as she was infected in her left hand a reddish allergy and itchiness with pain . The doctors said that it may be bacuse of Trental . Still the buzzing sound and pressure in her ears and pain around the left ear persists. Our query is this curable after taking these medicines as we are afraid that she will put on more weight after taking these tablets . Also how long it will take to cure this type of disease and whether this tablets will affect her body to conceive a second baby . Are the medicines prescribed are correct ones and in your opinion should we travel to India so that a more cost effective treatment can be taken. Should you need any further details please email me or send me a sms and I will call back. Regards JOSHY VARGHESE YYYY@YYYY +0000","Doctor":"Hi Joshy, It is not a blood related problem.

One history of pain on oily and cheesy food and when she is coming back home is indicative of some organic problem. We have to rule out all the probable reasons like Colitis, allergy to particular food, appendicitis, mesenteric lymph nodes -so common in this age group and worms.I would advise you to take her to the General / Pediatric surgeon when she is in pain so that a physical examination will help to see if she is faking or not, go for tests of blood, urine, stool, ultrasonography for a probable diagnosis and treatment.

Also my AST is elevated. I know this condition is not Hereditary, ruled out at Isoterix. I think that maybe the extremely low Testosterone is causing the blood problem, could you please advise, thanks Don.","Doctor":"Dear Don, There is no much literature on increased fibrinogen with low testosterone level, which leads to increased risk of thrombosis. I have not seen any such case so far. Bolouke is not recommended in any of the guidelines so far. There is a study stating that when supranormal doses of testosterone was given to normal subjects, there was reduction in fibrinogen levels by about 20% over 52 weeks.

Very rarely people with low monocyte counts can get some unusual infections such as mycobacteria, listeriosis, brucellosis etc. But I have seen many patients with less monocyte counts, but doing absolutely OK. As long as you dont have repeated bouts of fever, I would consider you as perfectly normal individual. Certainly low monocyte count is not related to your night shift work. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help.

They were working great, then I had an operation on my head that needed radiation. Since the radiation the shots have not been working as well. I am going in tomorrow for my third blood transfusion, my last blood transfusion was on June 15th. Are there any new treatments for MDS?","Doctor":"Treatment of MDS depends on the risk category of disease. If Erythropoietin is not working for you, then following are the treatment options: 1. If your MDS is of hypocellular variety or HLA DR 15 is positive or PNH clone is positive, then you may respond well to immunosuppressive therapy which consists of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and ciclosporine. 2. If none of the above are positive, we can treat you with hypomethylating agents. Two drugs are available in this category. They are Decitabine and Azacytidine. 3. If this also does not work for you and you are physically fit, we can do bone marrow transplant, which is a curative option for you. For this we will need a donor of stem cells. 4. If none of these work, then better to get enrolled in one of the clinical trials for MDS. The last option will be palliative care, which includes blood transfusion and other supportive/symptomatic medicines. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help.

Most of the ET patients have near normal lifespan. Only those who have thrombosis or transformation of ET to acute leukemia have reduced survival. This is the reference:  Please continue your daily physical activities without any restriction. I feel your fatigue is more psychological. If your hemoglobin level is more than 10gm/dL, then there is no need to worry about fatigue. Please get your blood tested for hemoglobin level. Hope I have answered your question.

I have all symptoms connecting me with anemia. Fatigue, headaches, insomnia overall I do not feel well. No strength in my legs I cannot stand for very long. I have had a transfusion of 2 pints of blood so far and am taking 3 iron tablets a day. So I am starting to feel a little better. One thing I notice is I smell smoke! Its the weirdest thing I thought it was just from my house but I smell it every where. What do you think that would be. I know it is connected because right after my transfusion I did not smell it. But of course the transfusion didn t last long.","Doctor":"This symptom is called parosmia. This has nothing to do with iron deficency or blood transfusion. Often it occurs because of infections in nose or upper respiratory tract. Please consult a ENT surgeon. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help.

I put make up so people can not see but I just do not know what causes that. I am 94 years and nothing else its wrong .. I just wonder why?","Doctor":"Please do following tests: platelet count, prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). If all these 3 tests are normal, then there is high possibility that, you are sufferring from senile purpura. It is just a age related change, which is harmless. It happens because of loss of collagen support to small blood vessels. Please get back with test results. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help. With regards, Dr. Girish Kamat"},{"Patient":"I have AVM and my blood count was 9.8 on March 6 and 9.7 last week. I am concerned, but my gastroenterologist seems to think it is just mild anemia. He has suggested an iron infusion, but my primary doctor believes i should have surgery. I cannot take any iron supplements or even Blackstrap molasses.","Doctor":"Hemoglobin level of 9.7 is significantly low. As a hematologist I would certainly treat that anemia with iron infusions. I would also tell my gastro collegues to take off AVM because of which there is chronic blood loss and iron deficiency. But the final decision about operating AVM lies with the gastroenterologist. No need to iron tablets or Blackstrap molasses, as the iron that you need can be given in the form of infusion. With availability of better forms of iron such as iron carboxy maltose, the side effects are also very less. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help. With regards, Dr. Girish Kamat"},{"Patient":"Could you help please. I have had a blood test carried out this morning as a further continuing blood test plan which was required as the result of a sudden viral failure (caused by a reaction to antibiotics). This occurred seven weeks ago. My eGFR was 4 six weeks ago is now 33. Other values such as Creatine are approaching normal. My GP is impressed with my recovery and results in the main are trending towards the normal range and he has taken me off Dialysis. I have had repeated blood tests every 2 days during dialysis, and now weekly since 12-06-2017. However my platelet count is today 138 x 10^9 /L. (Normal range is 150-400). This was 160 on 12/06/2017 and 167 on 19-06-2017? Is this serious and what can I do to assist returning to the prior OK values? This is a rapid drop - maybe the lab test today are faulty? Possible solution is wait a week for the next test? Please advise.","Doctor":"Platelet count of 138000/cmm, is not at all a serious issue. It may be transient drop or could be a lab error as well. There is no need to take any active measures to increase it to more than 150000/cmm. It is best to repeat a platelet count after 1 week. But if you have any bleeding complaints don't wait for long. Get the platelet count done urgently. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help.

They say I need more iron supplements or something to build up the blood count. Please elaborate on this for me.!","Doctor":"Hypergammaglobulinemia means increased globulin levels in blood. This can happen because of a blood cancer called as multiple myeloma. But good news is that, you are not having that cancer. This is what \\"unspecified\\" means. Iron is needed for hemoglobin synthesis. Whenever one consumes less of iron or there loss of iron due to chronic blood loss, hemoglobin level reduces below normal. We call this condition as iron deficiency anemia. So obviously, when supplemental iron is given in the form of tablets, hemoglobin level increases to normal level. If there is associated vitamin deficiency, those vitamins also need to be substituted. That is exactly what is being done to you. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help. With regards, Dr. Girish Kamat"},{"Patient":"Hi,My platelate count is around 6lacs n blood test shows iron deficiency. Dr advised me to take livogen 1 hr before lunch n dinner. Sometimes it happens I couldn t take before lunch. Can I take after lunch. How much time will it take to reduce the level of platelets.","Doctor":"Hi, Raised platelet counts are often seen in iron deficiency anemia. It takes about 2 months for hemoglobin to normalize after you have started iron replacement therapy. If you find it difficult to take livogen before food, it is OK to take it after food. There is some reduction in absorption when you take it along with or after food, but is fine. You have to take iron tablets for total of 6 months. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help. With regards, Dr. Girish Kamat"},{"Patient":"Hey, my husband was admitted into the hospital with a hemoglobin of 6. His vision has been blurred since the day before that. They only gave him one unto of blood and he now has a hemoglobin of 7.1. Is it normal for blurred vision during low hemoglobin levels?","Doctor":"Dear madam, Although blurred vision is not described well in literature as symptom of anemia, I have seen many patients who have this symptom, which gets better after correction of anemia. I send patients to ophthalmologist in any case just to rule out associated eye problems. You may also do the same thing. Transfusion of blood is not the solution for anemia. It is just a temporary measure to bring up the hemoglobin level. We need to evaluate your husband to know the cause of anemia and treat the cause. This would actually solve the problem.

I am not worried about it. But your eosinophil count is significantly increased. Reasons for eosinophilia enclude intestinal worms, allergic reactions, certain drugs, skin problems and autoimmune diseases. There are several other causes for increased eosinophil counts which are extremely rare. When absolute count is more than 1500/cmm, it may lead to damage to organs such as heart and lungs. Only in such situations, to prevent end organ organ damage eosinophilia is treated with steroids. Otherwise always one has to identify the cause of eosinophlia with the help of other investigations and try to treat the cause. Once the cause gets eliminated, eosinophilia automatically subsides.

I am a hemato-oncologist and nearly half of my patients suffer from benign blood problems. Even if she has a cancer, there is no need to get very much upset. Many of blood cancers can be treated easily, as excellent medicines which are available now. If after platelet transfusion there is no increment in counts, there is a high probability of a benign disease called as immune thrombocytopenia. For diagnosis of this problem a thorough history of symptoms, clinical examination of patient and careful look at peripheral smear would be needed.

However, she doesn t have pain in her bones","Doctor":"Dear, There are several causes for severe fatigue. If is because of anemia, a hematologist can treat your sister. Fatigue can also be due to other causes such as hypothyroidism, chronic heart failure, chronic infections such as TB, Addison's disease, electrolyte imbalances, myesthenia, diabetes etc. In such case appropriate specialist can treat your sister. It will be great if you can send complete hemogram report. Lymphocyte and eosinophil percentages are marginally high. We need to look at absolute counts, before coming to any conclusion. Hence I need total WBC count. Anyhow, such marginal rise in counts are generally is not significant. Fatigue may also be due to the viral infection that she had recently.
