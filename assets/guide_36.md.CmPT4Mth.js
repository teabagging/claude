It is absolutely normal for the semen to come out of vagina immediately after your Husband withdraws the penis. The average volume of semen produced at ejaculation is 2 to 5ml and 1 ml would be enough to get you Pregnant. The normal size of Non pregnant uterus weighs around 40 to 55gms as a result it cannot accommodate much of liquefied semen as a result it throws it out. So there is nothing to get concerned about. So keep trying it. If you do want to stop it, you can use a Tampon and place it inside your vagina immediately after withdrawal. Wish you Good Health and Good Luck. Take Care."},{"Patient":"my right follicile is ruptured on my 14th day of cycle and my endometric thickness is 8mm can i be pregnant if i have intercourse","Doctor":"hello welcome to healthcare magic. the egg survives only for 12 to 24 hours once the follicle ruptures. so yes, there are chances that you might conceive if you have intercourse now. hope you are already taking folvite tablets since you are trying for a pregnancy."},{"Patient":"sir, my last period date was 27 April 11.

Thank you for posting your query and I'm here to answer your question.. I read your question completely and have understood it well enough.. As a surgeon we come across such cases where the paternity is a question mark..

And any sexual encounter during these days will result in pregnancy.. Going by your case.. 1. You had sex with Guy A and had periods 2 days later. 31 August..  So your ovulation for August will definitely be somewhere around 17th or 18th. 2. Next ovulation will be around September 13,14.During these days you had sex with Guy B.

Do a thyroid profile and prolactin levels and a ultrasound for your uterus and ovaries.  Also a semen analysis of your partner should be done.  If everything is fine, you can try naturally for 3 cycles.  Be in contact with your partner every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  It will increase chances of your pregnancy.  If it doesn't work, then you can go for ovulation induction with timed intercourse.  In this, you will take medicines for growth of your follicles and track your follicles growth by repeated ultrasound.  When follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your partner for 2 to 3 days after injection.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.

Hi and welcome to HCM.. Thank you for posting your query.. I read your question completely and have understood it well.. I being a surgeon, we encounter so many such cases. You say, you have initial level of sperm Count, that means? Anyway, I will guide you what to do.. Generally, we term infertility only after 1 year of unprotected sex between couple. So Cheer up, you still have few more months.. Sperm counts lesser than 48 million per ejaculation as per recent guidelines are called oligopermia. That doesn't mean that, a male with 30 million sperm cannot have children, definitely not. And hence I need the exact sperm count of yours per ejaculation. Well, I will still try to solve your issue. 1.  If your counts are more than the number I've mentioned then you need not worry Do these things A.  Be positive, positive attitude gives good results B.  Make sure, your female partner is normal. C.  Have sexual intercourse, around the time of ovulation D.  You can use, Tablet Carnisure 500mg twice a day for 2 to 3 months. It helps. 2. If your counts are below the normal. If it's more than 20 million, then you still have pretty good chance. Lesser than 20 million, you need to go ahead with artificial insemination techniques. Hope I have cleared your doubts, in case you need any further assistance let me know..

A lot of times my periods come every other month and last about a week, so realistically, I'm not expecting a period again until early September. The past week or so I have felt extremely tired. I have not had any sort of morning sickness, however, I have had moments the past couple days where I have felt a bit queezy. If I take a home pregnancy test within the next couple days, how accurate will my results be, although I am not expecting a period? Thanks for your time.","Doctor":"Thanks for the query Not only have u had sex during your safe period, he has not ejaculated into u, so chances of being pregnant is very less.

Bigomet will help reduce blood sugar levels as you may be Diabetic because of PCOD. You need to lose weight. Eat more fresh fruits and green leafy vegetables. Drink plenty of water. Do brisk walking everyday for 40 minutes. When blood sugar comes to normal range you can be in better position to conceive. You need to get ultrasound evaluation of your ovaries to look for follicle rupture during ovulation period. If it is not there then you need to go on ovulation induction drugs like Clomiphene which will be prescribed by your Doctor according to your condition.

If large and/or multiple then more risk. Regarding Rh negative pregnancy, you need to get the Anti-D or Rho-Gam injection. It is given by intramuscular injection as part of modern routine antenatal care at about 28 weeks of pregnancy, and within 72 hours after childbirth. You need to get ultrasound of your foetus regularly which can monitor if any damage is there to the fortus along with doppler testing. Most pregnancies risk is less if the injection is taken. Kindly speak with your Obstetrician regarding the risk in your case and possible ways to prevent foetal risk."},{"Patient":"i delivered 19 yrs ago and now i was going 38, is ther possibility to get risk in pregnancy or stress pregnancy because of a long yrs gap of not getting pregnant if now wanting to get pregnant again?","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to HCM.

Welcome to HCM.. I read your question completely and have understood it well.. I am sorry to know your problem, but I am sure you will conceive normally. I being a surgeon have seen many such cases and most of them, like more than 90 percent of the times you should conceive normally without any help.. But I need some more information.. What has been removed in the right ovary? Cyst or ovary itself!!?? Both are potential possibilities.. But don't worry I will answer both sides 1. If only cyst has been removed, then superb.. You have almost no change in rate of conception. 2. In case right ovary itself Is Removed. Even then I suggest you not to worry. Definitely there's little reduction in rates of pregnancy but not that you won't be able to concieve.. It's simple, With one kidney people can survive With one testis, semen will be totally normal And hence, with one ovary you'll be fine.. Hope I've cleared your doubts, in case you need any other information,please let me know..

There are many causes for a late period, such as stress, travel, dieting, and exercise.

You can expect light spotting from your Vagina for a day or two after IUI. Wait for three weeks before taking an at home pregnancy test, when pregnancy hormone levels are at a measurable level. Testing too soon could result in a false negative,  meaning that the test result is negative when, in fact, you really are pregnant.  Again, since you have taken HCG Injection, testing too soon could produce a false positive that is a test result that indicates a pregnancy when you really are not pregnant, due to the HCG Hormone that is still circulating in your body. So you can just wait, and get a Blood Pregnancy test which is more sensitive. If you don't become pregnant, your Doctor might try IUI again before moving on to other fertility treatments. Often, the same therapy is used for three to six months to maximize chances of pregnancy. Wish you Good Luck, Take Care."},{"Patient":"i am 19 years old and sexualy involved with my aunt(sister of my mom)who is 46 years old .i cannot stop doing sex with her can u suggest me wt to do and our any chances that my aunt would get pregnant at the age of 46?","Doctor":"Hello abhi; welcome to HealthcareMagic The relation that you are at present having to be precise is called INCEST.My advise is since you are 19 yrs please stop it immediately as because it is in family later you will face lot of problems.Presently you cannot resist having sex is because you are infatuated with sex and enjoying it but later you will also have guilt feeling and it may lead you to depression so it is better to stop ASAP.Right now concentrate on your studies and career .

The Ovulation occurs 36-40 hours on an average after the Choriomon injection. The Sperms remain alive in Woman's body for 24 Hours.

If you have Ovulated and the sperms have been released the Fertilization happens in minutes, on an average around 30 minutes. Sometimes It can take minutes for at least some of the sperm to reach the fallopian tubes where they are stored waiting for the egg to release if it has not already been released.

It is not dangerous, but can leave skin scars. Your skin has pores (tiny holes) which connect to oil glands located under the skin. The glands are connected to the pores via follicles - small canals. Sebum, an oily liquid, is produced by these glands. The sebum carries dead skin cells through the follicles to the surface of your skin. A small hair grows through the follicle out of the skin. Pimples grow when these follicles get blocked. The majority of people who get acne will develop mild acne. This can usually be treated with OTC (over-the-counter) medications. OTC medications can be bought at a pharmacy without a doctor's prescription. They are usually applied to the skin - topical medicines. like Benzoyl Peroxide Salicylic Acid Retin-A  hope helped your query regards dr.surendiran hcmagic"},{"Patient":"i have moderate to severe cystic acne .

That is better since off the bactrim. My cysts are goin away slowly but leaving a reddish purple marks.What can I do to help with these marks and how long will the srintec take to fully work . I do see some improvement but its so slow and its so frustrating. Is there any way to bleach these marks?","Doctor":"Hi, Chances of pigmentation and scarring in acne depends upon severity and inflammation of acne lesions. As you have cystic acne, your acne are more prone to heal with pigmentation and scarring. To treat pigmentation multiple options like depigmenting creams, peels, microdermabrasion or lasers are available. As you are still having active acne lesions, application of a pigmentation reducing cream containing  Kojic acid, Azelaic acid, Glycolic acid or hydroquinone over the pigmentation spots would be helpful. Taking chemical peel sessions of Glycolic acid or salicylic acid would be very effective not only in reducing the pigmentation but also active acne lesions. From the medicines you are taking it seems you are having acne due to underlying hormonal derangement. For the same hormonal pills have been added, these might require couple of month's time to show good response. Adding oral isotretinoin along with the drugs you are taking would help. Hope that answers your query. Take care."},{"Patient":"I started using neutrogena complete acne therapy system about 1 1/2 weeks ago. Yesterday my skin started looking red.

What can/should I do to ease the pain and reduce the dry red skin?","Doctor":"Hi, It seems you have developed contact irritant dermatitis with the product. Kindly stop using the product. Use a steroid cream like mometasone twice in a day for a couple of days till redness subsides. Use a mild bland cleanser and moisturiser as harsh products can irritate the skin further ( cetaphil). Avoid sun exposure as much as possible. If its too painful, you may take a painkiller like ibuprofen. Do not try any home remedies as it might aggravate the irritant reaction.

The treatment is given in the form of oral medicines( azithromycin/ doxycycline/ minocycline and/or isotretinoin) along with topicals( clindamycin, benzoyl peroxide, adapalene tretinoin) etc. As you said you want faster results, that can only be delivered after a thorough skin examination so that a personalised skin treatment can be suggested. However, you may follow these basic suggestions to prevent and treat acne 1) continue with saslic face wash. Use it twice daily 2) you any continue with Olay cream, if it suits your skin well 3) get your blackheads and whiteheads removed regularly and apply retino a cream in comedone prone areas 4) treat your active acne lesions with application of clindamycin gel and retino a cream. Depending on your acne grade severity, oral therapy might be required, for the same consult a dermatologist nearby.

I continuously took treatment from a dermatologist for almost 6 months, but did not help but made my skin more sensitive. Originally my skin is very oily but now it has become sensitive also. Finally, i ve started using natural products for my acnes. I m using face wash with 2% salicyc and it is helping my problems. I ve read that benzoyl peroxide helps to resolve acne problems by drying them. Can you please suggest any cream or gel which has 5% bezoyl peroxide(Available in India(Delhi)), so that i can apply it on my acnes at night. Thanks in Advance.","Doctor":"Hi Namrata, Onset of acne in adult age usually points towards a hormonal derangement. To get the same confirmed a hormonal work up and a pelvic ultrasound needs to be done. Usually adult onset acne does not respond to topical therapy alone. A course of oral anti acne medicines like azithromycin, isotretinoin needs to be taken along with hormonal pills. The same can only be prescribed after a thorough consultation with dermatologist. In the meanwhile you can start with these 1) continue using salicylic acid face wash 2) as your skin has become sensitive, use a mild moisturiser and sunscreen. You may use acne moist moisturiser and suncote sunscreen 3) use benzoyl peroxide 2.5 percent( benzac ac gel) in daytime and adapalene gel in night. Apply these medicines only over acne lesions and do not rub the medicine. Too much rubbing or excess application can irritate the skin. Chances of irritation of skin are quite high with benzoyl peroxide 5 percent. So I would not advise you to use it without a proper skin analysis. 4) get your comedones extracted regularly. Hope that answers your query. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi sir, this is sukumar.... i am 26. I have been suffering from acne since at 14.

There is no result at all that too pimples became bigger...Please give me the best solution sir. Thankyou.","Doctor":"Hi Sukumar, The treatment suggested by your doctor is perfectly alright. These medicines might take 3 to 4 weeks to show desirable response. Sometimes with isotretinoin acne lesions can flare initially to improve later on and that is why many prefer to start isotretinoin in a low dose and later on dose is increased as per the response. In your case, if you have taken medicines for few weeks without improvement, your doctor would increase the dose of isotretinoin. So kindly continue with the medication and remain under a doctor's follow up. Hope that answers your query.

Chemical peels, microdermabrasion, manual dermabrasion, dermarollers, acne surgeries like subscision and in severe cases lasers are the options to treat acne scars. A proper treatment of your scars can only be done, once your skin has been analysed by a dermatologist. In the meanwhile you may begin with daily application of Glycolic acid 6 percent and retino a cream over your scars to improve them. These two would only be useful, if scarring is mild and superficial. Hope that answers your query.

Oily food tend to increase sebum production & may cause acne. Although this has not been proved, but there are evidences to support this.

My doctor stopped the course dis mnth n i again have acne on my face. He has now prescribed me clinoxid gel and azithromycin 125mg once a day. The results have not been great. Plz tell me wen wud the treatment show results and will my acne subside like it was wen on tretiva","Doctor":"hi..Thanks for your query I would like to mention here that Acne can present in several forms. This includes whiteheads, blackheads, and red, inflammed patches of skin (such as cysts).In the course of evolution, you may have any or all of these.Sometimes ,over a period of time, even if you are under a specific for of therapy,one agent might not be enough to handle it completely.This is based on the various internal hormonal stimuli as well, which can change several times in a month or year. Although you have been compliant with the methods advised to you, I feel that only this agent in the lowest dose might not suffice now.there may be a need of addition in oral /topical therapies.U have not mentioned your age now.Tretiva is a medicine which has potential side effects if used continuously,hence it is good to use the other agent  now. You can do a few sittings of Salicylic acid peels with qualified dermatologist to attain more sustained results without the potential side- effects of Retinoid therapy. Hope this helps..take care U definitely do not need to stop anything now, however please visits the doctor early so that there are no delays in the onset of more efficacious therapies."},{"Patient":"Hello, I had a pimple on my cheek that came up about 6 days ago. It got bigger so I popped it and a lot of puss came out. Yesterday I noticed that around the pimple if i squeezed my cheek, it would be very swollen around the pimple. It is painful, I don t have any type of acne problem. I usually get one small pimple per month. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hi, To treat your skin lesion- Do warm moist compresses Apply topical antibiotic cream like nadifloxacin or fusidic acid If its still swollen and painful you might require an oral painkiller and antiinflammatory like ibuprofen If the lesion does not show signs of resolution you might require a course of antibiotics also. Kindly consult a dermatologist for prescription of these drugs. Never manipulate any abscess/ boil/ pimple on face as it may have serious complications. All infected cystic nodular lesions should always be drained by a medical professional. Hope that answers your query. Take care."},{"Patient":"hello sir/madam, my name is pravin from  india.

I used dermovate and rose cream before but then i stopped for some reasons that i changed my cosmetics... Can I again use this mixture to lessen the pimples? Does it have side effects on my isotretinion?","Doctor":"Hi, Isotretinoin works well for acne. It might lead to dryness or irritation over face. For the same you could use a mild moisturiser. I would strictly advise you not to use dermovate cream over face as it is a very potent steroid and can cause permanent harm to your face like increase in pimples, thinning of facial skin with visible blood vessels, irritation and burning sensation over skin etc. Continue with isotretinoin and consult your dermatologist if isotretinoin causes severe dryness.

I am Dr Ramadevi Wani. I will be answering your concerns today. I am giving you some statistics to relax your mind. Among couples trying for conception only 25% conceive during each cycle, 80% conceive in a year's time and about 90% conceive in 2 years time  You are married since six months. Stop worrying. You probably did the ultrasound during ovulation time. That is why a small amount of fluid was seen due to rupture of follicle. This is a normal finding. Do not worry about it. This fluid will not affect your fertility.  If you repeat ultrasound immediately after periods, you will not see this fluid on ultrasound. If you have regular cycles, in all probability you are ovulating and you need not worry. To increase your chances of pregnancy, you both should maintain normal BMI, stop smoking ( if smoker), and have intercourse3-4 Ines in a week. If you do not conceive in another six months time, consult Gynecologist. I hope this is helpful.

Isotretinoin is considered to be a wonder drug to treat acne. It has its side effects, however if doctor's advice is followed properly it is quite safe to use. The only side effect, you might notice is dryness of skin and lips and that can be prevented by keeping your skin well moisturised. Other so called serious side effects occur only when it is continued for a prolonged period without doctor's supervision. Your doctor must have evaluated the safety and efficacy of the drug in your case. So trust your doctor, start the course and remain in proper follow up for an acne free skin.

Though they are good but response to these creams can vary from person to person. To treat acne, use a mild salicylic acid face wash and a water based moisturiser. If you are having comedones, get them extracted. Also visit a dermatologist, to get your skin analysed so that an oral antibiotic or oral isotretinoin can be started along with anti acne creams. Once your skin is better with medication, you can switch over to either of the products you have been using as maintenance(proactive or Vichy).Hope that solves your query.

Use of salicylic acid cream is indicated for non-inflammatory type, but for the other type you could associate with doxycycline tablets for 1 month. Also, benzoyl peroxide 5% lotion twice daily + doxy is also a good treatment of choice for acne. Also use of topical steroids would also be good. You also need to know that, for your age group persistent acne is normal and would give way gradually as you get older. The other possibility for your rashes on the back is that you might not necessarily be suffering from back acne. There are always other possible skin affections to rule out when dealing with rashes ( papula or pustula lesions) for example prurigo, eczema/dermatitis, fungal skin infection etc).

It started after being 4 days on Secnidal an antibiotic for a mild case of entamoeba histolytica . When that was gone, I was left with moderate blastocystis that I live with on and off for the last two years. I stopped trying to get rid of the blasto with antibiotics because they always return, and I cannot live on antibiotics. Instead, I occasionally take S. Boulardii, a yeast , to keep the blasto in check. I started to take them two months before the pimples came out. I felt that there might be a connection with the pimples so I stopped taking them for 10 days, but there is no reduction of pimples. I also have blisters on my scalp, but that started six months ago before I took the yeast pills; I already had blastocystis for 2 years.","Doctor":"Hi , Thanks for writing in.

Any creams containing tretinoin, hydroquinone, glycolic acid, azelaic acid, kojic acid would be good for you. But if you are still getting pimples, then you should treat them also so as to prevent any future marks. Always use a broad spectrum sunscreen as long as there is daylight outside.

Apply a combination of Tretinoin plus benzoyl peroxide cream/ gel at night for 1 month. 3. you could take A doxycycline 100 mg daily after meal for 1 month.

So as such it can be used to soothe the skin when having active acne lesions. However it won't work on acne pigmentation. To cure pimple marks creams containing Kojic acid, Azelaic acid, Glycolic acid, tretinoin, steroids, hydroquinone,liquorice, arbutin etc can be used. Similarly one can take sessions of chemical peels or microdermabrasion to reduce pimple marks. If the marks are too light they can be left as such without treatment as they will disappear on their own after some time. I would advise you to consult a dermatologist as depending on the type of post acne pigmentation treatment can be suggested. Take care."},{"Patient":"hi this is very embarrassing but can u please help me i'm am so close to a mental breakdown i've been going thru so much with my fiance and his cheating that i cheated as well on november12th but i also had sex with my fiance the same day twice unprotected....the other guy i had sex with we used a condom there were no breaks or tears in the condom and it didnt slip off during sex.....i just found out i was pregnant on last friday....my fiance is the only man i have sex with unprotected....is it safe to rule out the other guy if nothing went wrong with the condom when we had sex?? :'( please help","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to healthcare magic. I am Dr Ramadevi Wani. I appreciate your concerns. Since you have used the condom correctly, it is unlikely that the pregnancy is from  the other guy.  But as you know even when you feel condom was used correctly occasionally there can be failure resulting in pregnancy. So if you want to be 100% sure, then you need to do paternity test. I hope this helps. If you have further concerns, I will be happy to answer."},{"Patient":"i am facing cystic acne for 3-4 years,every time my dermotologist prescribed isotretinoin and then tetracycline antibiotics ..after using the above mentioned drugs my skin used to be free from acne for a period of 5-6 months...but again acne used to appear....every time my derm prescribed only 1 month of isotretinoin ...but i read that 5-6 months of isotretinoin treatment is required...wat is the exact dosage of isotretinoin....","Doctor":"Hi, hope you are doing great. The dose of isotretinoin varies depending on the body weight and one full course is for 20 weeks. The dose can be continued till all the existing acne have gone and formation of new ones has been stopped. Therefore, it may take upto an year. Despite all this, if there is a relapse, the cycle needs to be started again"},{"Patient":"Hi, I had severe acne in my early teens, that only lasted about two years (12-13). It was on my face, chest , back, behind and even thighs. Slowly but surely, the acne on my face, chest and back subsided, but never fully on my behind or legs. I was then told what was on my behind and thighs was folliculitis . Now I am in my early 20 s and have broken out on my face again. This time, there are no cystic pimples , but small bumps with no white or black heads ALL over my face. It started on my forehead , with lots of itching, and within a week was all over my face and neck. What happened? And why hasn t the follilculitis gone away yet?!","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to Healthcare magic. Your skin condition is most likely Keratosis pilaris with or without acne. It is a familial skin condition which appears usually at upper thighs and upper arms but may be at back shoulder face and some times generalized. You can use the following though treatment is not always required- 1. Capsule- Tetracycline 500mg (or doxycycline 100 mg / minocycline 100mg ) twice daily  for 1-2 months orally. 2. Tretinoin cream or gel/ Adapelen cream or gel- you could apply twice daily on trunk and extremity and once at night on face for 1-2 months 3. Follow up needed after end of 1-2 months.

Now also I am taking azithral, cymino-100 and a multivitamin and have undergone laser treatment three shifts on 15 days duration.still dont find much effective. what should I do?","Doctor":"Hi, Firstly for your acne problem, I would advise you to take a prolonged course of  oral isotretinoin along with topical anti acne creams as it will not only cure active lesions but also prevent further recurrences. You might require six month course of isotretinoin  to induce permanent remission. Scars and marks will reduce to some extent with oral isotretinoin too. Later on sessions of peels and lasers can be taken to reduce pigmentation and scarring. However, it is suggested that one should avoid these procedures when on isotretinoin and for better results there should be a gap of 3 to 6 months between these sessions and isotretinoin therapy. Do not worry, acne can be managed easily with a proper treatment compliance under an expert dermatologist.

If the lesions are less in number, it can also be managed with topical medicines like adapalene or clindamycin gel. Use a salicylic acid based face wash and a water based moisturiser to keep skin well hydrated. As far as diet and acne is concerned, the association is debatable. Dairy products and food with high glycemic index seem to have some link with acne. However if you feel that you develop acne after having eggs or chicken, you might be allergic to them. So try stopping them for few days. Take care."},{"Patient":"I am 16 year old girl and I am getting pimples in my face. It also pains sometimes. Currently I am using Acnil cream.

I would suggest you to consult a gynaecologist who would advise the required hormonal assays and ultrasound. Sometimes, sudden onset of acne can be facial or cosmetic induced too.

So keep your scalp clean. Instead of using supatret c for an hour only apply it over areas of involvement overnight. However use very small amounts and do not rub as it can lead to irritation of skin. Also if one is not having much response, you can start with oral isotretinoin 20 mg for 10 to 15 days. To prevent further recurrences it is always better to get your comedones extracted manually or by radiofrequency. Once your skin is clear, use a mild face and a water based moisturiser to keep skin healthy and acne free.

Also get all your comedones (black heads and white heads) extracted regularly and avoid facials. Consult a dermatologist to advise you a treatment plan best suited to your skin. For acne multiple treatment options are available like antibiotics, isotretinoin, topical anti acne gels and creams. Also one can take Glycolic acid or salicylic acid peels. Similarly for scars, one can go with microdermabrasion, micro needling or lasers once the active acne lesions have healed. Once your skin has been assessed, then only according to severity of acne, treatment can be advised. Take care."},{"Patient":"I am a 27 year old male with very little history of acne . I (foolishly, I know) popped a forehead pimple which was roughly a half in diameter and a quarter in raised. Then, I applied an OTC topical acne cream to it. About 2 hours later my forehead skin felt tight so I looked in the mirror and literally my entire forehead is swollen--swelling stops at all hair lines; scalp, eyebrows etc. I believe it is called pitting edema because if I apply pressure the dent remains. The swelling is of normal skin color, not red (other than the location of the pimple). Does this require a visit to the ER? Will warm compression help? If it does require a visit to the doctor, is it urgent or wait a day or 2?","Doctor":"Hello, Yes, you should visit a doctor now because you possibly require the intake of antibiotics for this. Also, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory meds are also required to decrease the inflammation that has been associated with this. Hot compresses would also help. However, it is better if you make a visit to the ER now and get the required prescription so that you can start off the meds without delay."},{"Patient":"how to cure acne from tuberculosis .

As you can see, its basically a multiple combination cream containing antibacterial, antifungal and steroid to control inflammation. These multiple combination creams have very few specific indications but are misused very commonly as over the counter treatment for fungal, bacterial infections, acne and pigmentation. These creams would harm more than benefitting in any of the conditions mentioned above. These should never be used to clear pigmentation or acne over the face. Take care.

Regards , AAAAA M-19-Pakistan","Doctor":"Hi there, It's usual to give Prednisolone which is a steroid,in the course of Bell's palsy along with Anti virals. So it seems like you are having steroid induced acne,but nothing to worry about it will go away with time as you discontinue the medication after completing its course. In the mean time you can apply Clinagel gel twice a day on the pimples and I am sure that it will help you a lot. Thanks very much and all the best."},{"Patient":"Hello Dr. I am 22 year old girl.I had a problem called acne and acne scar in my face.My face is oily and sensitives. My face is becoming dark.I had used Deriva CMS Gel. but works like little bit on my face.Please Dr. I am begging you tel me how to stop such problems.Tell me the medicine or cream to stop the problems.I will be thank full for the whole rest of my life sir.Please Dr. Please.","Doctor":"Hi Rina, Use a good  medicated face wash meant for oily skin atleast twice in a day and follow it with an alcohol free toner and a water based moisturiser.  Apply gel based sun screen while going out. Drink adequate amount of water and take healthy nutritious diet. This would take care of  excessive oiliness and darkness over your face. As far as acne and scarring is concerned, there are many treatment options available to treat acne and scars including oral and topical antibiotics, isotretinoin, chemical peels  lasers, microdermabrasion and microneedling etc. Simply using deriva cms is not going to solve your problem completely.  Consult a dermatologist so that severity of your acne and scarring can be assessed and a proper treatment plan can be suggested. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi dr I have acne last 5 year but I take dematologist treatment andl acne problem solve but in between sometime this problem occure and leaves a scars on skin and now a day again same acne again prevent on face and its a red spots that are inner side the skin hard type and also pain after few day its made white pimple then leave it spot on skin I m so worried about it bcoz already have scars on skin","Doctor":"Hi there, It seems like you are having Nodulo cystic acne. This type of acne is usually resistant to the conventional medications and treatment. So I would say you are a candidate for Isotretenoin therapy,this is Vit A derivative and proven to be very helpful,but you need to go to your dermatologist because this medication is not suitable for all people and you have to be reviewed before staring the therapy. Regarding the scars,I can understand your concerns,here again I would say there are many options but you need to see a dermatologist to give you an option which best suits your skin and can have the maximum results, I hope you can understand my point. All the best."},{"Patient":"i m 17 years old.i have lots pimples on my face since the last 2 years and want to get rid of them as soon as possible so i have started to consume DOXIL 100 ( doxycycline hcl lactic acid bacillus capsule).should i continue to take this medicine or not.what precautions should i take to cure my pimples.any tablets of creams that you can suggest?","Doctor":"Hi there, I can understand your concerns, I would have asked you the duration of the antibiotics you are on. Well the duration of the medications depends upon the response and the illness being treated. If the response is good then can be continued accordingly and if not then the dosage can be increased or the antibiotics can be changed. It all depends upon the grade of your acne,the doctor who is treating you and the response to your medication. You also haven't mentioned your gender and grade of acne,and you are after a very quick response so I would like to say discuss the option of Isotretenoin with your dermatologist. There are many different kinds of topical therapies for the acne,again depending upon the typ of acne ranging from Retenoids(isotrex,adapalene) to antibiotics like clindamycine,benzoyl and many others. So the bottom line is that discuss all these options with you dermatologist and I am sure there will be suitable regime for you. Thanks very much and all the best."},{"Patient":"Sir , I have been applying deriva-Cms gel for acne from past 2 weeks . During this process I started to experience flaking and dryness of skin after washing my face with water everytime. Is there any way to reduce this dryness because it s becoming quite embarassing and moreover I have red acne sacars on my face , it would be of great help if you suggest a topical treatment for lightening these scars .","Doctor":"Ho there, I can understand your concerns. I believe your gel contains Adapalene,if so then it's quite common to have some redness,irrtation and dryness after using it. Therefore I advice my patients to start with it as follows Ist night for one hour on ye affected areas Second night for 2 hrs Third night for three And fourth night for four hours Then after this period apply it overnight and the wash your face with a soap free face cleanser(Nivea) in the day. It can also make your skin more sensitive to sunlight so liberal use of a sunblock of Minimum SPF 30 is advisable throughout the day. As far a scars are concerned then please see your dermatologist and discuss the options of Microdermabrasion and chemical peeling to lighten the scars,they are very effective. I hope you ll find these answers helpful. Thanks a lot and all the best."},{"Patient":"I m 25 years old, I was suffering from chronic stubborn acne, it wasn t very severe, but it was not sensitive to many medications (like fusidic acid , clidamycin, erythromycin creams), and it bothered me so much, so I started using Retinoic acid (40 mg/day for 3 months). my face became very clear ,no acne, no scares.

There is a fixed dose schedule which is necessary to reduce the chances of recurrences of acne.

You can use a mild moisturiser or calamine lotion to soothe your skin. However if your skin is dry or too much itchy along with redness then you might use a mild steroid cream or pimecrolimus. I would not suggest using demelan at this point of time as it would irritate your skin  and make it more red. Use a good sunscreen too, it will prevent darkening of your skin.

Once the pimples have subsided, you can take treatment specially meant to reduce  pigmentation over your face. For pimples, use a good anti acne face wash and consult a dermatologist for prescribing you with anti acne medicines for oral and local use. If you have a sensitive skin, the doctor will obviously advise mild preparations so that it does not irritate and darken your skin. you can also use a good sunscreen and take oral supplements of vitamin c to prevent further darkening of your skin. Once the acne has subsided, your doctor might advise creams meant to improve pigmention and complexion. you can also think of taking microdermabrasion sessions or peels. The advantages  of peels are that they not only tackle pigmentation issues but also helps in acne.As far as melaglow is concerned, there is nothing wrong in using it. It will not help in acne but might help in pigmentation. Take care."},{"Patient":"Sir, I am facing too much problem from pimples since 6 years ago. Now I am 22 years old.

Sometimes the acne, especially the inflammatory type, get worse with isotretinoin but ultimately improve on continuation of therapy.

Discuss the option of taking oral and topical anti acne medication meant for acne with your doctor. Peels as such have wonderful effect in acne and if combined with medication, the effects are better and more long lasting. Salicylic acid and Glycolic peels can be considered for the purpose. If there is scarring, again peels, microdermabrasion or micro needling with dermarollers or in extreme cases lasers are an option.

Do try to do a light steaming followed by splashing cold water on the region to help release the pus that seems locked in. This will help clear your sinuses' in addition. Swelling in the midline of the face needs to be taken care of soon as it was what used to be taught to us as students as being the 'dangerous area' of the face because of its proximity to the sinuses higher up & the chances of what we call a cavernous sinus thrombosis...hence the need for immediate intervention with an antibiotic.

I would be pleased to help you with your question HOME BASED ROUTINE: 1. You can use the over the counter salicylic acid based face wash ( eg. Neutrogena Deep pore cleanser , Normaderm Vichy) .  Use the face wash twice a day . 2. Use an alcohol free toner for the free outflow of the oil from the oil glands after using the face wash. ( e. Sebamed toner) 3. If you are using a sunscreen you should use a light water based SPF 15 sunscreen. 4. Do not use a moisturizer untill necessary as heavy moisturizer use can cause more acne on skin . Dermatological CLINIC Based Services: 1. Salicylic acid is a a form a peel treatment , a liquid which is applied over the skin by the doctor. This is kept on the skin for a period of 5 minutes and removed out with water. The peel seeps in the skin and controls the size of the oil glands giving rise to acne . It also has mild antibiotic properties. 2. The dermatologist might prescribe you certain oral or topical application antibiotics., The above regimen is ideal for controlling your acne .

Never pick or squeeze pimples. Acne treatment is focused on (1) to unclog pores, (2) to kill bacteria, and (3) to minimize oil. Wash your face twice daily with a mild cleansing soap or liquid. It  will keep your  skin clean and minimize sensitivity and irritation or cleanse twice daily with a 5% benzoyl peroxide wash. An alternative for those who are allergic to benzoyl peroxide is 2% salicylic acid. A variety of mild peeling agents (scrubs, exfoliants, and masks) can be used. These products remove the outer layer of the skin and thus open pores. Retinol (derivative of vitamin A) can help promote skin peeling. To get rid of oil on your face and reduce the embarrassing shine, use a gentle astringent/toner to wipe away oil. Masks containing sulfur and other ingredients draw out facial oil. Antibacterial pads containing benzoyl peroxide have the additional benefit of helping you wipe away oil. Apply a gel or cream containing 5% benzoyl peroxide; an alternative is sulfur or resorcinol. At night, apply a spot cream containing sulfur to the affected areas. Use a light skin moisturizer and water-based oil-free makeup. You may require a course of Antibiotics (erythromycin, clindamycin , sulfacetamide or azelaic acid). Retinoids ( Retin-A /adapalene/tazarotene) are especially helpful for unclogging pores.  Epiduo gel contains the adapalene along with the antibacterial cleanser benzoyl peroxide and can be applied once daily. Some contraceptive pills have been to shown to have modest effectiveness in treating acne. Spironolactone act by blocking androgen (hormone) receptors. Cortisone injections make large pimples and cysts flatten out fast. Isotretinoin is an excellent treatment for severe, resistant acne. It should be used for people with severe acne, chiefly of the cystic variety, which has been unresponsive to conventional therapies like those listed above. Laser treatments of acne is best thought of as an adjunct to conventional therapy, rather than as a substitute. Superficial chemical peels (like glycolic acid) & deeper ones (performed in the doctor's office), are modest, and give supportive benefit only, and in general, they do not substitute for regular therapy. Don't be afraid to hide blemishes with flesh-tinted coverups or even foundation, as long at it is water based (which makes it noncomedogenic). Steaming and \\"deep-cleaning\\" of pores is useful. Strips are available, which you can put on your nose, forehead, chin, etc., to \\"pull out\\" oil from your pores. Hope you found my response to your query informative and helpful.

Firstly you are newly married so relax..these things have a hormonal background to their pathology & as such there are bound to be fluctuations. Add to that stresss & change of environment & you have enough reasons for the potential flare-up. Second, are you on any oral contraceptives & have you done any pregnancy test & if negative, are you planing for a baby soon? Based on all this & viewing your lesions (please upload photographs), only then can a dermatologist give you a more honest picture & a concrete managment plan ...either local treatment or systemic but that again will vary on the cost factor, side effects, expectation & type/grade of acne. As for the acne pigmentation/marks, you may try to apply a 2% hydroquinone cream on the 'spots' for starters & then may upgrade to 4% & this of course is provided you dont have an allergy to these creams.

Most recently, I was on Bactrim for a year and then two weeks ago, I switched to minocyline. I was only on it for 3 days before I stopped using it because my stomach was not reacting well to it. I was fine for a few days after that, until, a few days later, my stomach began acting up again with loose stools , cramping, bloating , gas, nausea, and heartburn . This has been going on for 7 days. I have heard of C. difficile as a result of antibiotic use and I am worried that this could be the reason for my stomach problems. I saw one doctor and they said they did not think it was c. diff because I was not on the antibiotic for very long. Eventually, I ended up in the E.R for stomach pains. They did blood work and an ultrasound there (though no stool sample) and said everything looked fine and chopped it up to gastroenteritis, but I m still worried c. difficile could be to blame?","Doctor":"Hi there. Antibiotics certainly can cause the above mentioned side effects. Whether you have C Difficile or not, only a stool culture or some very specific tests can tell you. No point in being worried. Suggest eat some yoghurt based products for awhile to promote the natural flora.

Initially I used salicylic acid facewash 2.5%, alongwith 2.5% benzac AC which seemed to reduce the acne considerably in a month. However, the acne recurred and the same medication did not work again. Right now for the last one week I have been using prescription medicine as follows: 1: deriva MS - applied all over face for 1-2 hrs. 2: benzoyle peroxide facewash 4% twice a day. 3: faceline+benzac 2.5% combination on the comedones every night. Now the comedones have come down but have instead become flatter and my face looks really red all over. How do I get rid of these red scars and how do i prevent further acne?","Doctor":"Hi there. At the outset, i note your problem has been present awhile now. No single treatment regime in acne works for all patients. If there is one medication that has 'universal appeal' in acne managment it has to be Roaccutane (systemic isotretinoin). It however has side effects & your dermatologist will be the best person to explain these in detail, take a consent form you before starting & do a series of preliminary blood tests & as per protocol at regular intervals during treatment. From your description you will definitely do well with a non-comedogenic sunscreen ( i usually recommend Bioderma sunscreens formulated especially for acne patients) to reduce the redness & while using systemic isotreinoin therapy.

Pimple at this age is due to excessive activity of your oil glands of your skin due to bubbling hormonal action. Up to the age of 25, it is an ongoing process. After the hormonal tides start reduced your problem will vanish completely. So the treatment cannot totally eradicate the appearance of pimples whereas it will help to reduce the intense to the maximum extent. Frequent face wash, consuming adequate water, vegetables, fruits, greens and avoiding foods containing butter cheese, ghee, and vanaspathy etc will help you to keep this menace well under control along with specific medical treatment for pimples. Medical treatment has lot of choice according to the severity, your skin and type of lesions from topical preparations, oral antibiotics, soaps etc. Your dermatologist will guide you in this regard for a better treatment of choice to suit your present condition. Following all these measures together you can keep your problem well under your control. Wish you a speedy recovery.

The treatment depends on many factors like staging of acne, frequent recurrences, family history, tolerance of medications, side effects of drugs etc. Your doctor must be right in deciding that you may have to stop dianne at this stage. antibiotics like tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, azithromycin, clindamycin can all be given with lesser side effects. Of course antibiotics will reduce only one causative factor for acne ie. bacterial colonization You felt better because dianne is an anti androgen and can stop oil secretion from sebaceous glands. so, the best thing to do is listen to your doctor's advice. It is difficult for me to tell you which is best as it depends on number of factors.

I would be vain if i were to suggest you could consult with me if you so desired a 'good' dermatoloigst. The fact of the matter is that most of my ilk are good & competent so you may want to pick one closer to where you stay etc. I hail from Bangalore & have just moved back in after a decade of practicing in the Gulf & dealing largely in lasers, fillers, cosmetics etc al & am in the process of establishing quality clinics in & around Bangalore. As for your particular problem, yes & no. I-pill may be the culprit. It is after all a hormonal derivative & as such may alter hormonal balances in your body & lead to a spurt of acne as you have. Alternatively, it may be an 'allergic' reaction judging by the history you give that it is the '2nd' time you have taken this i-pill & were apparently fine the first time...may be a hypersensitivity reaction. Presently, avoid all further trysts with the infamous i-pill. Apply a benzoyl-peroxide/adapalene combination cream on the 'acneiform' lesions & you may benefit from a short 10 days to 2 week course of twice a day oral doxycycline hydrochloride antibiotic course (assuming you dont have any allergies to the same/medications). Of course all this is best in consultation with your friendly neighbourhood dermatologist :) All the best..cheers.

Ketoconzaole or ciclopirox is also effective for mild cases of acne on the scalp. There are times when oral medications such as antibiotics and topical steroids can also help treat acne on scalp problems As hormones fluctuate, there is an increase of oil being secreted from the sebaceous gland. It allows dirt to accumulate in the pores and results to pimples. Stress. Too much stress can alter as well the normal balance of hormones of an individual. When experiencing a breakout, the best way to deal with it is to apply hot compress. That way, a blind pimple can be able to grow a head and eventually come out. Wash your face once in a while to remove accumulated dust and dirt. Avoid using too much makeup. If you are just going out for a grocery, you need not put on makeup. Dealing with acne, pricking an irritated or inflamed papule would just make it worse. Start a zinc supplement. Zinc is a very effective treatment for acne. Rich food sources of zinc are – nuts and legumes. Cinnamon : Cinnamon has strong anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Pound cinnamon and apply it over the affected area. It will help clear up the face successfully. Even applying a drop of cinnamon oil over the pimples speeds up healing. mail me at payalrawatchauhan16@gmail.com thanks"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 30 and just started having major acne , i beleive its caused from taking melatonin . its now been 6 months since i stopped taking it and it doesnt seem to be getting better. i have never had acne before and now have severe very large infected cysts and very oily scin for the first time. how can i get my system to go back to normal?

Even when I don t touch the acne I still get dark spots or scars. I was wondering if I need to see a doctor about this problem, since acne is considered not a big of a deal. Is there any medication or product you think can help fade the scars and reduce acne?

First, establish the type and severity of acne. Second, select medication appropriate for the patient’s condition and skin type. In general, patients with oily skin benefit from solutions or gels, while those with dry skin do better with creams, lotions, or ointments. Third, educate yourself about the disease, the different types of medications (including birth control pills) and their side effects, and expectations for improvement that are realistic. Realistic expectations should enhance compliance and lead to the successful resolution of a chronic debilitating disease. All of which result from a multifactorial pathophysiologic process in the pilosebaceous unit: sebum production, follicular hyperkeratinization, proliferation and colonization by Propionibacterium acnes, and the release of inflammatory mediators. The resulting lesions include noninflammatory open (blackheads) and closed (whiteheads) comedones, as well as inflammatory papules, pustules, and nodules. A variety of medications are available for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Note that most treatment regimens should be used for at least 6 to 8 weeks to judge their effectiveness before considering alternative treatments or adding other agents. Will recommend to visit your clinician or dermatologist before switching or trying any medications.

My doctor suggested accutane, and so, last year i took the drug and for about 4 months after, my skin stayed clear. But, my acne has come back, not as severe as it was but it still flares up. I am currently on antibotics and trying murad, a cleanser that my beauty therapist thought would do the trick. Do you have any idea of why im getting my acne back? and, what steps should i take from here? Go back on accutane and try again?

Although some males are just more hairier then others and the amount of hair you have is not an absolute  indicator of testosterone levels.The basic cause is genetics in most of the cases . You can look at the men folk on your maternal and paternal sides of the family to get an idea of what your genetic traits are, as they relate to hair, you inherit these genes predominately from your mothers side. Although if you are very concerned about your testosterone levels you can visit any doctor and get S. testosterone levels tested by a simple blood test.If the levels are abnormal or low ,which is very unlikely , do visit an endocrinologist for the further management.

However two years ago I got pimples around my cleavage and the marks haven t gone. Recently, almost two weeks ago, another pimple formed. It was puss filled. The pimple hasn t gone and its worrying me. Puss still comes out and sometimes blood too. I wash the area everyday with benzoyl peroxide wash. I eat a lot of fruits and vegetables and drink plenty water. Please tell me what I can do to get rid of the marks and to get rid of this pimple. It s been there since two weeks now and its not drying. :( Could you also tell me the reasons for this.","Doctor":"Hi Amaya,Welcome to HCM.Acne( pimples) is a common problem in people who have oily skin and especially at your age. They often turn in to pustules due to secondary bacterial infection due to pricking or pressing. Benzoyl peroxide is useful in treating acne. But if it does not give any response then preparations containing Retinoids have to be taken. Using antibiotics like Doxycycline will help in treating infected acne. Do not squeeze the acne as it might leave a scar.Based on the details  provided you seem to be having Seborrhoeic dermatitis. The reason for the pimples on the anterior chest wall ( cleavage) is dandruff of scalp. Anterior chestwall, nape of neck , interscapular area, forehead and the v area of chest ( cleavage) are the areas where the  dandruff flakes tend to fall resulting in an inflammatory reaction there by leading to nodules or pustules and may end up leaving marks.Treating the primary cause ( dandruff in your case) is essential. Using shampoos that contain Ketoconazole ( Nizoral shampoo manufactured by Johnson and Johnson) twice a week should help you. Apply the shampoo thoroughly to the scalp . This would definitely help you to get rid of this problem. Even the marks would disappear slowly. In case if the marks are big and embarassing then using creams that contain allantoin or hydroquinone ( hydroquinone cream should be taken only after consulting a doctor) should help you.Hope you got the solution you were looking for.Wish you  a healthy life.Take Care"},{"Patient":"i already went to the doctor and got my blood taken for a check for anemia ,got medication . so my question is my doctor didn t say i had any OTHER problems, but i get these not painful or bad but red acne kinda bumps around my chest ,especially the left one but they dissappear after a while turning into dark lines and part of my skin like they were always there. i have not done anything new in my life or eaten things that may cause anything, ive always been healthy, shower a lot so what do u think this is, im 18 yrs.","Doctor":"hi Maryan ,Acne may occur beside face at back ,upper chest ,upper part of arms some times at hip area also, take care of it by frequent washing of affected parts ,don't apply oily creams and oil etc. consult your dermatologist ,he/she will prescribe you  some ointments ,that would be very effective in your case . so don't get dis hearted as acne has no relation with food ,It is a common problem in your age .

Key is in maintenance, acne can be due to multiple causes and be of various type. If you do not have active pimples now but have marks opt for retinoic acid 0.025% at night, and do not forget to use a sunscreen in the day time suitable for your skin type such as suncross aquagel or ansolar. As a procedure you can opt for chemical peels or mesotheraphy targeted to reducing skin pigmentation. Have vitamin C rich fruits and meet a cosmetologist who can explain you further about these procedures and  assess your skin.

Its depressing for me to not notice much results.","Doctor":"hello, i can understand your concern. i would recommend that you stop the melalite cream.. first of all, the most important thing to prevent darkening of skin is to prevent constant sun exposure by using a sunscreen of SPF more than 50 if possible. this has to be applied on all exposed parts half an hour before going out to sun and reapplied every 4 hours. a daily regimen of cleansing your face thrice a day, moisturizing and using sun screen is very effective. also application of glycolic acid 6 % cream will help in resolving the marks. it has to be applied at night daily. regards"},{"Patient":"hello sir,i have acne prone skin i was taking treatment for last 1 yr i was on steroids, bp ,retinols altough my skin was cleared but i stoped it as it is not good for long run,right now my skin is flaring up,red,dry,little pimples ,sensitive to whatever i use i dont want to be on high chemicals ,peels again please suggest me some regimen which i can follow without using any antibiotics and creams ,thank you","Doctor":"hello, thanks for using just answer. i will be glad to be of assistance. hope you have not been picking up on any of the lesions as that will lead to deep scars and pigmentation. you need to follow a routine of cleansing, sunscreen , creams daily. cleanse your face with cetaphil cleansing lotion for acne prone skin thrice daily. sunscreen needs to be used daily , neutrogena would be a good choice. this regimen will be good to prevent acne, however to treat acne you need to atleast apply one anti acne cream. i suggest you use nadifloxacin cream twice a day on the acne. that should be helpful. using steroids for acne is not recommended, it can lead to a flare in acne. please let me know your queries. regards"},{"Patient":"Hi, you can call me for short. I really won t go this far if my problem isn t really serious. I am having a severe acne problem plus some scars on my face. I feel so degraded whenever I go out on a crowd because I m too ashamed of my facial problem. I just wanted to ask if do you know any remedies to it and I mean natural remedies because I don t really trust synthetic remedies for my face. I tried to put on some facial scrub and mask on my face which I started last month. I also bought a Salicylic acid and havn t use it yet because I m a bit uncertain about it s effect. I tried taking vitamins like Vit C. and Vit E. to boost the effect of the reparation. I didn t have this problem before until the year I went to US of A to be a part of an Exchange Program.

Thank you Dr.","Doctor":"Hello thanks for using Health Care magic . I would be pleased to answer your question In that case here is an over the counter regimen for acne that works quite well: 1. Use a salicylic acid face wash (e.g. Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Salicylic Acid Acne Treatment) to wash your face, gently massaging it in for 1-2 minutes before washing off. 2. Clearasil Stayclear Tinted Acne Cream applied twice a day over the pimples. Be careful not to apply too much. There may be slight redness and flaking of skin, but this is normal. Do not apply on non pimply skin. 3. Neutrogena On-The-Spot Acne Treatment Vanishing Cream: This can be applied safely over the entire face (barring around the eyes and mouth) once at night. Apply a think film, do not rub. This will prevent new pimples from coming and must be used daily for 2-3 months. 4. Omega three fatty acid capsules: Take one morning and evening after meals for 2-3 months. 5. An antioxidant containing beta carotene or lycopene taken twice a day daily for 12 weeks. 6. Lastly some general precautions - Do not pick or burst lesions, this causes scarring; do not touch your face unnecessarily; avoid hair oil application; limit sunlight exposure especially between 10 am & 4 pm. 7. A word on diet - though there is no conclusive evidence it is a good idea to cut down on very oily & sweet foods.

Vitamin E overdose is something you should not have. Need not to worry as long you’re not overdoing it by keeping your intake to less than 1,000mg a day. Here you are using only 400 mg vitamin E which is okay, so it is safe. Taking at least 100 mg per day is best if you want to get the full benefits of vitamin E. The best way to do this is through proper supplementation, i.e., by taking 400 mg strength.Taking too much vitamin E (more than 1,000 mg /day) for a long time will give rise to bleeding disorders, prevent platelet aggregation, and low vitamin K levels in the body. So take care and good luck.Hope I have answered your query.

It is very common to get pimples (acne)at this age due to the hormonal changes taking place in your body with puberty.They do subside as age advances. However it is advisable to get it treated if you are getting pustules or nodular acne  which leave behind hyperpigmented scars on the face causing the face to appear dark. So a consultation with a dermatologist would be beneficial if you really suffer from bad acne scars. Meanwhile Here are some tips to help prevent breakouts and clear them up as fast as possible: 1.Wash your face twice a day  with warm water and a mild soap . Gently massage your face . Don't scrub. Overwashing and scrubbing can cause skin to become irritated . 2.Don't pop pimples. It's tempting, but you shouldn't: Popping pimples can push infected material further into the skin, leading to more swelling and redness, and even scarring. 3.Avoid touching your face with your fingers or leaning your face on objects that collect sebum and skin residue like your phone. Touching your face can spread the bacteria that cause pores to become inflamed and irritated. To keep bacteria at bay, wash your hands before applying anything to your face, such as treatment creams or makeup. 4.Keep hair clean and out of your face to prevent additional dirt and oil from clogging your pores. 5.Protect your skin from the sun. It may seem like a tan masks acne, but it's only temporary. A tan may worsen your acne, not improve it.

Welcome To HealthcareMagic forum, If you are still getting acne it is important get it treated first and  then go for scars. If you have black spots on face due to acne then chemical peel is the best .Its a very short procedure which helps in exfoliating your skin gradually.It is done by a dermatologist where in a chemical (like glycolic acid or salycylic acid) is used over face and then washed off after 3-5 minutes.Regular use of sun screen is must. If you have pits or ice pick scars then you have two options depending upon the availability in your city.One is laser resurfacing where in lasers like co2 ,erbium laser or fractional laser is used .Other is Dermaroller where a instrument is used which has fine needles is rolled over the skin to cause minimal bleeding .This in turn causes collagen remodeling which help in filling up of  the scars.This requires multiple sittings for good result. A combination of dermaroller and chemical peel can also be taken .So discuss these points with your dermatologist and take treatment accordingly.But remember ,ice pick scars are very difficult to treat even though new lasers have come for  the same. If you can tell me where you belong to ,then probably i can suggest you a good place for lasers and peels. regards, Dr.chawda"},{"Patient":"hi, i am 27 yrs old male and i am suffering from acne of all kind from last 10-12 yrs, means one that pains with redness, with yellow liquid also etc. and they all can occur in any size.","Doctor":"hi vimit apply clindac a gel twice a day take tab azithromycin 250 twice a day use cetaphil cleansing lotion for face wash dont prick it diet healthy. drink more water"},{"Patient":"sir i have acne problem so what can i do to stop this.","Doctor":"hi..welcome to healthcare magic.. acne is common in adoloscent and young age group..wash your face very often with normal water..take plenty of fluids and eat healthy foods..if its severe u can start taking a antibiotic and apply benzoyl peroxide skin ointment twice daily"},{"Patient":"hi, if you have been to the doctors before to get something checked out and they tell you that you have something similar to acne what can you ask for to get rid of them ?","Doctor":"Hi,thanks for query.Acne is very common problem of growing age.The reasons are hormonal changes,oily skin and enviormental effect.Please avoid too much of junk food,take good care of your skin after coming from out side.In case of infected acne you need to take a course of antibiotics to get rid of it.Some local creams also help.In case of severe problem,get in touch with a dermatologist. wishing you good health."},{"Patient":"My 6yr old son is getting blackheads on his face .

What should I do?","Doctor":"Hi!, Welcome to HealthcareMagic forum, Treatment of acne depends upon the severity of acne.What you  have received is good.In fact roaccutane which you have mentioned as an antibiotic is actually not an antibiotic but a retinoid.I hope your doctor has told you all the side effects of this medicine since you are getting married in 2 months time.Roaccutane is a wonderful medicine for acne ,it would give good result in one months time,but it has certain side effects like ,patient should not get pregnant during  the course of medicine and at-least 3 months after stopping this medicine.It has teratogenic effect on the baby.Other precautions are that one should not donate blood during the course ,should not wear contact lenses,should have a normal liver function test & blood counts before start of the medicine.And if you get headache after this medicine then you should stop the medicine.I hope this was told to you before start of the medicine.In your case pregnancy is the most important precaution . If you can take all the above precaution then roaccutane would be best to treat your acne ,provided your hormone profile is normal.Once started this medicine needs to be given for at-least 6 months depending upon your body weight. Deriva ms is just a gel and alone it might help you a little bit.Patient with hormone im-balance with associated acne would need hormonal medicine to treat their acne. So,kindly discuss all this with your dermatologist and then proceed for treatment. regards, Dr.chawda"},{"Patient":"Hi. I am having acne on my face and back from almost one year now.

Severe acne can be treated by many ways including drainage and surgical excision, interlesional corticosteroid injection, isotretinoin, oral antibiotics and oral contraceptives as well. The right method can be choosen only after your examination and considering your choice. Subcision surgery is a minimally invasive surgical procedure to help eliminate skin surface imperfections. This procedure takes approximately 15 minutes to 1 hour depending on the areas to be treated. Minor discomfort, bruising and swelling, all of which are normal. You may return to light activities 1-3 days after procedure. So you can talk to your doctor and decide for yourself among the options available to you for treatment.

Welcome to HealthcareMagic forum, Treatment for acne and acne scars are two different treatment.First get your acne treated .Once you are through then go for scars.Treatment for acne depends upon the stage of acne.Selection of right soap or face wash is most important .You should not use oily soaps.Use dermadew acne soap once daily.Apply nadoxin cream topically over the lesions once a day.Take tab Azithral(500mg) once daily for 5 days(1hr before food).Drink 8-10 glasses of water daily.Take good 7hr sleep.For scars you can go for lasers like fractional laser which is the latest of the lot.If its mild then even dermaroler is ok.For spider veins you have to go for lasers again and its a different laser than that for acne scars.You can go for 532 nm q-switched laser or long pulsed Nd:yag laser or a PDL(pulse dye laser) laser which is the specific laser.Some doctors even do electro cautry for the same.If you can tell me where you belong to ,then i can guide where to consult for all the three treatment.

Lastly,if the above methods doesn't help then you can go for IPL (Intense pulse light) or lasers.This would be a costly treatment and would require multiple sessions.

I then had ocular plastic reconstructive surgery on Jan 20, 2011 which necessitated stitching a portion of my lower lid to upper lid to create a new lower eyelid margin, as well as pulling up surrounding skin tissue to cover the Mohs open wound below the eyelid to the lower right. I was given a prescription for oral antibiotics and a pressure bandage was applied. My upper right eye lid itched and hurt and finally in accordance with instructions from the Mohs procedure we removed the bandage on Jan. 23, 2011. it was caked with dried blood and the upper portion had been applied incorrectly to where it curled up thus creating the sensation of fingernails digging into and itching on my upper eyelid.. I used Biacitracin and gauze with telfa pads and kept the area very clean. I noticed small bumps on my lower lid and on the outer right side corner. On my follow up visit on Jan. 25, 2011 I pointed out the red swelling on the outer portion of my upper lid, and small pus like bumps where the stitches are on the outer right edge. He snipped two stitches at that time. The surgeon said I did not need to wear a bandage any longer. That night my right eye felt as if it had a lump of coal rolling around in it. I went in for another emergency appointment on January 26, 2011 and the Doctor checked my cornea and put in drops. I then was told how to uses the anti biotic ointment and given eye drops. At that time I again pointed out the pimple like bumps on the outer edges of my right eye where stitches are. I asked if i needed to get a refill of the oral antibiotics to prevent infection. He responded that it did not look like an infection. I also asked about the 2 yellow stiff stitches still hanging below my lower eyelid which are dissovable ( or so they say.) I had another follow up visit on Feb 2, 2011 and the same issues were still present. However, the pimple on my right lid was becoming larger and my upper lid is still quite inflamed on the outer right side. I again asked if i needed an oral antibiotic ( i rarely use them.) I was again told no it is not necessary just continue using the ointment. The doctor did not comment or seem alarmed about the redness on my upper eyelid, or the two stiff yellow stitches still hanging down on my lower lid or the pimples on the outer edge of my right eye . Before leaving, I asked his assistant about the two visible stiff stitches hanging on my lower lid area and she told me to start using more warm compresses and ointment and said that the stitches should dissolve. I have another appointment on Feb 7, 2011 to have my eyelid opened. This involves cutting the upper and lower stitched areas apart and some cauterization and bandaging.. MY concerns are as follows: The dis solvable stitches are stuck and my lower lid and it is very sore because of them. i want them removed. Secondly, i have now developed 2 external cysts on the outer part of my right eyelid which I pointed out repeatedly to the surgeon. I am concerned because cysts usually require a surgical removal. I am puzzled as to why i was not given addition oral anti biotics and my issues were down played. In researching online i find that cysts can and do develop in some surgical sites especially if stitches are left in too long. How should I handle the conversation with the doctor? He is excellent and very skilled but not seemingly interested in my particular concerns. As a specifier and business professional, i am very detail oriented and want information rather than things being glossed over. I now have 2 cysts that were not present prior to surgery, 2 snipped dis sovable stitches that are irritating, which were put in 17 days ago and an inflamed eyelid. Is this typical ? Lastly, I have had rotator cuff surgery and debridement and neck fusion c5-6 & c 6-7 with no complications and no problems with stitches. Please advise. My apologies for the long missive. Thank you. P Kirk Colorado","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing to us. The snipped dissolvable stitches can be removed by slightly tugging a their margins as 17 days is a long enough time for an eye wound to heal. The cysts are chronic granulomas and will be best if treated under the guidance of a plastic surgeon. I hope this information has been both informative and helpful for you.

Currently however, I tried using legal stimulants and energy drinks to help me stay up for a new overnights job. (mistake!!) About four days ago I had a minor issue where I picked at an area directly between my eyes, on the bridge of my nose. If it helps any, essentially i thought at the time I was popping, individually, a cluster of zits and I probably pursued this to the point where I was squeezing hair follicles or my pores or something, but obviously the surface of my skin was scraped off in that small area before I came to my senses. The resulting wound is about the size of a iris of an eyeball and you can see little bumps which I assume are my pores exposed. Well, I am in the food service industry and this resulting strange type of wound is awkward and it s likely grossing people out. I realize not using the stimulants is the cure and that s completed but i d like to know what non-prescription medications or ways to treat this are most effective or also maybe common things people try but ends up making it worse- for example over-washing with harsh soaps or the traditional picking. One last thing, each day when after I shower if i even run a towel over the spot, the scab-type tissue which has softened up in the water will completely and painlessly wipe off, leaving it looking much much better. But since it four days later I m thinking that every time i do that I m simply starting all over again. But i tell ya, the scab on this particular thing gets ridiculous looking and so its very tempting to use the towel to smooth it back out.
