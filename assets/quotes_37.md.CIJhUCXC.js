Let ( s ) be the number of square faces and ( t ) be the number of triangular faces.2. According to the problem, no two square faces share an edge, and no two triangular faces share an edge. This implies that each edge of the polyhedron is shared by one triangular face and one square face.3. Each square face has 4 edges, and each triangular face has 3 edges. Since each edge is shared by one triangular face and one square face, the total number of edges contributed by the square faces must equal the total number of edges contributed by the triangular faces.4.

The minute hand moves at a rate of 6^{circ} per minute, while the hour hand moves at a rate of 0.5^{circ} per minute. This means that in one minute, the relative movement between the minute and hour hands is 6^{circ} - 0.5^{circ} = 5.5^{circ}. Given that the minute hand and the hour hand coincide for the ith time, we can express the total movement of the minute hand in terms of degrees as 6a_{i}, where a_{i} is the number of minutes the minute hand has moved. Similarly, the total movement of the hour hand can be expressed as 0.5a_{i}. Since the minute hand has to make a full cycle to catch up with the hour hand, we can set up the equation based on their relative movement:[(6 - 0.5)a_{i} = 360i]Simplifying this equation, we get:[5.5a_{i} = 360i]Solving for a_{i}, we find:[a_{i} = frac{360i}{5.5} = frac{720}{11}i]This shows that the sequence {a_{i}} forms an arithmetic sequence with the first term a_{1} = frac{720}{11} and a common difference of frac{720}{11}. To find out how many times the minute hand coincides with the hour hand within 24 hours, we need to ensure that a_{i} leqslant 24 times 60 = 1440 minutes. Substituting a_{i} into this inequality gives:[frac{720}{11}i leqslant 1440]Solving for i, we get:[i leqslant frac{1440 times 11}{720} = 22]This means the minute hand coincides with the hour hand 22 times within 24 hours. To find the sum of all such a_{i} within 24 hours, we use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence:[S = nleft(frac{a_{1} + a_{n}}{2}right)]Since a_{i} forms an arithmetic sequence and i goes from 1 to 22, we have:[a_{1} + a_{2} + ldots + a_{22} = 22 times frac{720}{11} + frac{22 times 21}{2} times frac{720}{11} = 16560]Therefore, the sum of all such a_{i} within 24 hours is 16560.

Point B must have at least 1 additional line segment, so there are at least 9 line segments in total.(3) If each point has at least 3 line segments, then the 7 points together have at least 21 line segments.

We then deduce:B Q_{1}+R_{1}=B Q_{2}+R_{2} Longleftrightarrow Bleft(Q_{1}-Q_{2}right)=R_{1}-R_{2}We reason by contradiction. Suppose operatorname{deg}left(Q_{1}-Q_{2}right) geqslant 0.

Therefore, operatorname{deg}left(Q_{1}-Q_{2}right)=-infty, that is, Q_{1}=Q_{2}. It follows that R_{1}=R_{2}.- Existence: We proceed by induction to show the following property:\\"for any polynomial A of degree leqslant n, there exists a pair (Q, R) such that A=B Q+R with operatorname{deg} R<operatorname{deg} B\\"- Initialization.

Let A be a polynomial of degree leqslant n+1.- If operatorname{deg} A leqslant n, then the induction hypothesis allows us to conclude.- If operatorname{deg} A=n+1, then A-frac{operatorname{dom}(A)}{operatorname{dom}(B)} X^{n+1-operatorname{deg} B} B is a polynomial of degree leqslant n, where operatorname{dom}(A) and operatorname{dom}(B) denote the leading coefficients of A and B, respectively.

On the other hand, we can say that the digit 0 is eliminated from the digits to be considered because it increases the number without increasing the weight.We have that 2000=9 times 222+2. Therefore, the number we are looking for has 222 digits 9, and one digit 2 or two digits 1. We eliminate the case of numbers with two digits 1 because they have 224 digits, and thus are larger than the numbers that have the digit 2 and have 223 digits.

There are two possible ways of cutting.1) The cut lines are parallel. Let x be the length of one side of one of the rectangles in the partition, then it is not difficult to express the other sides. In this case, 1 leq x leq 4, so the perimeter of the original rectangle is 2(2 x+5)=14,18,22 or 26.2) The cut lines are perpendicular.

Define the transformation and points:   Let (P = (x_1, y_1)) and (Q = (x_2, y_2)) be two points in the plane. The images of these points under the linear transformation (f) defined by the matrix (A) are:   [   P' = A begin{pmatrix} x_1  y_1 end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} ax_1 + by_1  cx_1 + dy_1 end{pmatrix}   ]   [   Q' = A begin{pmatrix} x_2  y_2 end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} ax_2 + by_2  cx_2 + dy_2 end{pmatrix}   ]2.

Square both sides to eliminate the square roots:   [   frac{(ax_1 + by_1)^2 + (cx_1 + dy_1)^2}{x_1^2 + y_1^2} = frac{(ax_2 + by_2)^2 + (cx_2 + dy_2)^2}{x_2^2 + y_2^2}   ]6.

For this to be non-negative, both the numerator ((2020 - n)^2) and the denominator (2020 - n^2) must be non-negative.3.

Without loss of generality, we can consider the positive asymptote for calculation: y=frac{b}{a}x.Given that the circle is tangent to the asymptote, the distance from the center of the circle, which is (6,0), to the line defined by the asymptote must be equal to the radius of the circle, sqrt{20}.For a point (x_0,y_0) and a line Ax+By+C=0, the distance from the point to the line is given by frac{|Ax_0+By_0+C|}{sqrt{A^2+B^2}}.

If n has r+2 binary digits with r > 0, then there are 2 [(r+1)/2] numbers with the central r digits symmetrical, so that f(n) = n (because we can choose the central digit and those lying before it arbitarily, the rest are then determined). Also there is one number with 1 digit (1) and one number with two digits (3) satisfying f(n) = 1.

It remains to prove the assertions above. f(n) odd follows by an easy induction. Next we show that if 2 m < 2n+1 < 2 m+1 , then f(2n+1) = f(n) + 2 m . Again we use induction. It is true for m = 1 (f(3) = f(1) + 2). So suppose it is true for 1, 2, ... , m. Take 4n+1 so that 2 m+1 < 4n+1 < 2 m+2 , then f(4n+1) = 2f(2n+1) - f(n) = 2(f(n) + 2 m ) - f(n) = f(n) + 2 m+1 = f(2n) + 2 m+1 , so it is true for 4n+1. Similarly, if 4n+3 satisfies, 2 m+1 < 4n+3 < 2 m+2 , then f(4n+3) = 3f(2n+1) - 2f(n) = f(2n+1) + 2(f(n) + 2 m ) - 2f(n) = f(2n+1) + 2 m+1 , so it is true for 4n+3 and hence for m+1. Finally, we prove the formula for f(2n+1). Let 2n+1 = b r+1 b r ...b 2 b 1 b 0 with b 0 = b r+1 = 1. We use induction on r. So assume it is true for smaller values. Say b 1 = ... = b s = 0 and b s+1 = 1 (we may have s = 0, so that we have simply b 1 = 1). Then n = b r+1 ... b 1 and f(n) = b r+1 b s+2 b s+3 ...b r b s+1 by induction. So f(n) + 2 r+1 = b r+1 0...0b r+1 b s+2 ...b r b s+1 , where there are s zeros. But we may write this as b r+1 b 1 ...b s b s+1 ...b r b r+1 , since b 1 = ... = b s = 0, and b s+1 = b r+1 = 1. But that is the formula for f(2n+1), so we have completed the induction.

At the point (1, 0), the slope of the tangent line would be 1. Hence, the equation of the tangent line at this point is y=x-1. This line intersects the y-axis at the point (0, -1).Since the hyperbola C is centered at the origin and has foci on the y-axis, we can write its equation in the form y^2 - x^2 = b^2 - a^2, where a is the distance from the center to a vertex on the y-axis, and b is the distance from the center to a co-vertex on the x-axis.Given that one vertex is at the intersection point (0, -1), we have a=1. The eccentricity e of the hyperbola is given by e = sqrt{2}, and the relationship between a, b, and e is e = c/a, where c is the distance from the center to a focus. Since e = sqrt{2} and a = 1, we find that c = sqrt{2}.We can now use the relationship c^2 = a^2 + b^2 to find b. Substituting a=1 and c=sqrt{2}, we get:b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = (sqrt{2})^2 - 1^2 = 2 - 1 = 1Which gives b = 1 (since b is a distance, it is positive).Therefore, the standard equation of the hyperbola is:frac{y^2}{a^2} - frac{x^2}{b^2} = 1 Rightarrow frac{y^2}{1} - frac{x^2}{1} = 1 Rightarrow y^2 - x^2 = 1In conclusion, the standard equation of the hyperbola is:boxed{y^2 - x^2 = 1}"},{"problem":"8.

Alex knows that there are m red and n blue balls in m+n=K boxes. Let him then bet frac{|n-m|}{K} of his capital on the color that is more frequent (if m=n, Alex bets nothing). We will prove by induction on K that this way Alex will increase his capital by a factor of frac{2^{K}}{C_{n}^{K}}.For one box, the statement is obvious; the capital increases by a factor of 2. If the statement is true for K-1, we will prove it for K boxes. Let's assume for definiteness that m leq n.If a box with a blue ball is opened, at this step the capital increases by a factor of 1+frac{n-m}{K}=frac{2 n}{K}, and there remain n-1 blue balls out of K-1 boxes, which according to the induction hypothesis leads to an increase by a factor of frac{2^{K-1}}{C_{n-1}^{K-1}}. Multiplying these numbers and taking into account that frac{K}{n} C_{n-1}^{K-1}=C_{n}^{K}, we get the desired frac{2^{K}}{C_{n}^{K}}. If a box with a red ball is opened, the capital decreases, being multiplied by 1-frac{n-m}{K}=frac{2 m}{K}, and there remain n blue balls and K-1 boxes. By induction, in this case, the increase is frac{2^{K-1}}{C_{n}^{K-1}} times. Multiplying and taking into account that frac{K}{m} C_{n}^{K-1}=frac{K}{m} C_{m-1}^{K-1}=C_{m}^{K}=C_{n}^{K}, we again get the desired increase.By induction on K, we will show that a greater increase is not possible. For one box, this is obvious. If there are more boxes and Alex bets a larger portion of what is indicated in the algorithm on the blue color, upon opening a red ball, he will get less than by the algorithm. And if he bets a smaller portion of what is indicated in the algorithm (including a negative one, if betting on red), he will get less than by the algorithm when a box with a blue ball is opened."},{"problem":"Find the value of frac{tan {{20}^{circ }}+tan {{40}^{circ }}+tan {{120}^{circ }}}{tan {{20}^{circ }}tan {{40}^{circ }}}.","solution":"[Analysis]This problem involves simplifying trigonometric functions to find their value, which falls under basic trigonometry.[Enhanced Solution]Step 1: Use the trigonometric identity for the sum of tangents:tan a + tan b = tan(a + b)(1 - tan a tan b)Applying this identity to the given problem, we get:tan 20^{circ} + tan 40^{circ} = tan(20^{circ} + 40^{circ})(1 - tan 20^{circ} tan 40^{circ})Step 2: Substitute the simplified value back into the original equation:frac{tan {{20}^{circ }}+tan {{40}^{circ }}+tan {{120}^{circ }}}{tan {{20}^{circ }}tan {{40}^{circ }}} = frac{tan ({20}^{circ}+{40}^{circ})(1-tan {20}^{circ}tan {40}^{circ})+tan {120}^{circ}}{tan {20}^{circ}tan {40}^{circ}}Step 3: Simplify further using the values of tan {120}^{circ} and tan ({20}^{circ}+{40}^{circ}):frac{tan({20}^{circ}+{40}^{circ})(1-tan {20}^{circ}tan {40}^{circ})+tan {120}^{circ}}{tan {20}^{circ}tan {40}^{circ}} = frac{sqrt{3} - sqrt{3}tan {20}^{circ}tan {40}^{circ} - sqrt{3}}{tan {20}^{circ}tan {40}^{circ}}Step 4: Factor out -sqrt{3} from the numerator:= -frac{sqrt{3}(tan {20}^{circ}tan {40}^{circ} - 1 + 1)}{tan {20}^{circ}tan {40}^{circ}}Step 5: Cancel out common terms:= -sqrt{3}Hence, the final answer is boxed{-sqrt{3}}."},{"problem":"frac { sqrt {3}}{2}- sqrt {3}sin^{2}15 ° = ______ ．","solution":"To solve frac { sqrt {3}}{2}- sqrt {3}sin^{2}15 °, we can rewrite it as frac { sqrt {3}}{2}(1-2sin^{2}15°), which equals frac { sqrt {3}}{2}cos30° = frac { sqrt {3}}{2} times frac { sqrt {3}}{2} = frac {3}{4}.Therefore, the answer is: boxed{frac {3}{4}}.This solution utilizes the double-angle cosine formula to convert 1-2sin^{2}15° into a trigonometric function of a special angle, thereby finding the value of the algebraic expression.

According to the experimental process of this method, the number of bacterial colonies on a plate at a certain dilution degree has a certain degree of randomness and is not absolutely uniform. Therefore, taking the average number of bacterial colonies on several plates is closer to the true value of the number of bacteria in the sample. The dilution spread plate method may result in several bacteria being together. When two or more cells are connected, only one colony is observed on the plate. No matter how high the dilution degree of the sample is, it is difficult to distribute each bacterium individually on the culture medium. Therefore, the counting result is lower than the actual value.Hence, the correct option is: boxed{text{B}}.Analysis: The dilution spread plate method can be used for the counting of microorganisms.

By definition, the set of divisors of ( n ) can be split into three subsets with equal sums. This implies that the sum of all divisors of ( n ), denoted by ( sigma(n) ), must be at least ( 3n ) because ( n ) itself is one of the divisors and must be included in one of the subsets.

Because |GP| = 2|GF|, we have:frac{sqrt{(x_0 + 2)^2 + y_0^2}}{sqrt{(x_0 - s)^2 + (y_0 - t)^2}} = frac{1}{2}.Squaring and rearranging, we get an equation:3(x_0^2 + y_0^2) + (16 + 2s)x_0 + 2ty_0 + 16 - s^2 - t^2 = 0 quad (1).Since G (x_0, y_0) is on the circle C_{1}, we have another equation:x_0^2 + y_0^2 + 8x_0 = 0 quad (2).Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get:(2s - 8)x_0 + 2ty_0 + 16 - s^2 - t^2 = 0.Because G is any point on the circle C_{1}, the coefficients of x_0 and y_0 must equal zero, as well as the constant term. This leads to a system of three equations:begin{cases}2s - 8 = 0 & (a) 2t = 0 & (b) 16 - s^2 - t^2 = 0 & (c)end{cases} Solving the system, we find s = 4 and t = 0.Therefore, there exists a fixed point P in the plane with coordinates boxed{(4, 0)}."},{"problem":"3.

Find the maximum number of divisors of a sympathetic number.## - Solutions -","solution":"Let n be a fixed friendly integer, and let d be a divisor of n. If d equiv 1(bmod 3), then d+2 equiv 0 (bmod 3), and since d+2 is prime, this means that d+2=3, so d=1.Now suppose there exist two primes p and q, distinct from 3, which both divide n. Then p equiv q equiv 2(bmod 3), so p q equiv 1(bmod 3), and p q does not divide n. We conclude that n must necessarily be of the form 3^{k} or 3^{k} p^{alpha}, with k in mathbb{N}, alpha in{0,1} and p a prime such that p equiv 2(bmod 3). The integer n will then have sigma_{0}(n)=(k+1)(alpha+1) divisors.We will now show that sigma_{0}(n) leqslant 8. First, since 3^{5}+2=245 is not prime, we know that k leqslant 4. Consequently, if alpha=0, we know that sigma_{0}(n)=k+1 leqslant 5, and if k leqslant 3, then sigma_{0}(n) leqslant 2(k+1) leqslant 8 as well. We therefore need to show that the pair (k, alpha) cannot be equal to (4,1).To do this, proceed by contradiction, and suppose that n=3^{4} p. Since 3^{4} times 5+2= 407=11 times 37, we know that p neq 5, so p is invertible modulo 5. Now, since 3^{2} equiv-1 (bmod 5), the integer 3 has order 4 modulo 5. Therefore, there must necessarily be an integer ell between 1 and 4 such that 3^{ell} equiv-2 p^{-1}(bmod 5), and then 3^{ell} p+2 is not prime. ^{2}.We have therefore shown that sigma_{0}(n) leqslant 8. Conversely, if n=3^{3} times 5=135, then n of course has 8 divisors, which are 1,3,5,9,15,27,45 and 135 itself. It is easily verified that 3,5,7,11,17, 29, 47 and 137 are all prime numbers, for example because they have no prime factor p leqslant 12=sqrt{144} other than themselves.Therefore, the integer n=135 is friendly, and the maximum number of divisors sought is therefore equal to 8.## V.

However, a bold symmetry argument, for example, can sometimes allow one to bypass this long process (but, alas!, these arguments are rarely applicable outside a particular case...)## Before starting the resolutionEven before thinking about a resolution path, the first reaction is always to look for obvious solutions, such as:-x mapsto 0-x mapsto 1-x mapsto a-x mapsto x-x mapsto x^{2}-x mapsto 1 / x-x mapsto frac{e^{x}+e^{-x}}{2} 1In the vast majority of cases, the functional equation has one or more solutions of this form, which are generally the only ones. Having an idea of what one is looking for can indeed be useful when one is looking to prove it.In parallel, proving that a functional equation admits only \\"simple\\" solutions (or, more generally, solutions of a certain form) is generally not enough to conclude: it remains to verify that all candidate solutions are (or are not!) valid, which avoids, for example, going from 7 / 7 to 5 / 7 on a functional equation exercise.Also, keep in mind that a solution function is not necessarily simple (polynomial, continuous, differentiable...), but can on the contrary be a highly pathological object (we will notably see a little later functions that cover, in a certain sense, the entire plane!)## SubstitutionThe first reflex to have in front of a functional equation is to substitute one of the unknowns with a value that is easily manageable, such as 0, 1, or f(0). This technique has several advantages:- It allows simplifying the functional equation, allowing, for example, to manipulate f(x) instead of f(x+f(y)) by taking (x, y) leftarrow(x-f(y), y)- It allows obtaining information about the behavior of f at particular values, thus allowing more effective substitutions (for example by simplifying the expression obtained even more).This strategy is particularly useful in the case of expressions of the form x+f(y) and f(x cdot f(y)), which both simplify to f(0) by taking (x, y) leftarrow(0,0); or similarly x cdot f(y) and f(y cdot f(x)), which simplify to f(0) by taking (x, y) leftarrow(1,0).1.

Therefore, m is parallel to n.

Each person must receive two books, and we need to consider that the order in which each individual receives the books does not matter for this problem.Breaking this down into steps:1. Choose two books to give to Person A out of the six available. We can do this in binom{6}{2} ways.2. Next, choose two books to give to Person B out of the remaining four. We can do this in binom{4}{2} ways.3. Person C will receive the last two books, which can only be done in binom{2}{2} = 1 way.However, since we’re distributing books to distinct individuals, we shouldn't be considering the different orders in which the persons receive the books.So, the total number of ways to distribute the books isbinom{6}{2} times binom{4}{2} times binom{2}{2}.Calculating the values of the combinations:- binom{6}{2} = frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = frac{6 times 5}{2 times 1} = 15,- binom{4}{2} = frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = frac{4 times 3}{2 times 1} = 6,- binom{2}{2} = 1.Therefore, the total number of different distribution methods is:15 times 6 times 1 = 90.However, we need to consider that within each pair of books given to a person, the order does not matter. So, for each person, we are overcounting by a factor of 2! (because there are 2 books, and we need to account for the fact that they can be given in any order). Since there are 3 people, and we overcount by 2! for each, we must divide our total by 2!^3:frac{90}{2! times 2! times 2!} = frac{90}{2 times 2 times 2} = frac{90}{8} = 11.25.Since the number of ways cannot be a fraction, there must be an error in this calculation. Let's revise it.

The general term formula for the expansion of (1+x)^{5} is given by {T}_{r+1}={C}_{5}^{r}{x}^{r}. This means each term in the expansion can be represented as a combination of x to a power multiplied by a binomial coefficient.2. When we multiply the expansion by x and frac{1}{x}, we get (x+frac{1}{x})(1+x)^{5}=x(1+x)^{5}+frac{1}{x}(1+x)^{5}. This operation will shift the powers of x in the expansion by 1 up and 1 down, respectively.3. To find the coefficient of the linear term, which is x^1, we look for terms in the expansion that will result in x^1 after the shift. For the term multiplied by x, we need a constant term from (1+x)^{5}, which corresponds to r=0 (since {T}_{r+1}={C}_{5}^{r}{x}^{r} and we want {x}^{0}). For the term multiplied by frac{1}{x}, we need a quadratic term from (1+x)^{5}, which corresponds to r=2 (since we want {x}^{2} to become {x}^{1} after division by x).4. Calculating the coefficients for these terms:   - For r=0, the coefficient is {C}_{5}^{0}=1 (since any number choose 0 is 1).   - For r=2, the coefficient is {C}_{5}^{2}. The value of {C}_{5}^{2} is calculated as frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = 10.5. Adding these coefficients together gives the coefficient of the linear term in the expansion: 1 + 10 = 11.Therefore, the coefficient of the linear term in the expansion of (x+frac{1}{x})(1+x)^{5} is boxed{11}."},{"problem":"Let [x] denote the greatest integer less than or equal to x, for example, [pi] = 3.

Assume M contains n positive integers a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n.    We are given that for any two different a, b in M, a^2 + 1 is divisible by b.

Then, for each a_i in M where i neq 1, a_i must divide a_1^2 + 1.3. Analyze the divisibility condition.   Since a_i divides a_1^2 + 1 for all i neq 1, we have:   [   a_2 cdot a_3 cdot ldots cdot a_n leq a_1^2 + 1   ]   This is because each a_i is a divisor of a_1^2 + 1 and they are all distinct positive integers.4.

If the division operation's quotient and remainder can both be expressed in terms of a and b, the problem would be easier to solve. However, this is unlikely because both the divisor and the dividend are cubic polynomials in a and b. Further consideration reveals that if we can reduce the degree of the dividend, we can apply the conclusion from the commentary of Example 1 to solve it. After some attempts, we discovered the following identity to eliminate the cubic terms:begin{array}{l}bleft(a^{2} b+a+bright)-aleft(a b^{2}+b+7right) =b^{2}-7 a .end{array}Thus, according to the problem, a b^{2} + b + 7 divides b^{2} - 7 a. At this point, the dividend is a quadratic polynomial.Next, we need to make some precise estimates in different cases.(i) If b^{2} - 7 a > 0, then it must hold thata b^{2} + b + 7 leqslant b^{2} - 7 a < b^{2}.But this is impossible.begin{array}{l}text { (ii) If } b^{2} - 7 a < 0, text { then } a b^{2} + b + 7 leqslant 7 a - b^{2} < 7 a .end{array}Thus, b^{2} < 7, which means b = 1 or 2.When b = 1, the condition of the problem becomes a + 8 divides a^{2} + a + 1. Noting that a^{2} + a + 1 = (a + 8)(a - 7) + 57, it follows that a + 8 must be a divisor of 57 = 3 times 19, i.e.,a = 19 - 8 = 11 or 57 - 8 = 49.When b = 2, we have 4a + 9 divides 4 - 7a. Since 0 < 7a - 4 < 2(4a + 9), and 4a + 9 = 7a - 4 has no integer solutions, this case is impossible.(iii) If b^{2} - 7a = 0, then b = 7k and a = 7k^{2}, where k is a positive integer.

The k-th row of Pascal's triangle corresponds to the coefficients of (x + y)^{k-1}. For the 11th row, the coefficients are:   [   binom{10}{0}, binom{10}{1}, binom{10}{2}, ldots, binom{10}{10}   ]   These coefficients are:   [   1, 10, 45, 120, 210, 252, 210, 120, 45, 10, 1   ]3.

Since according to the problem statement y_{1}=x_{1}, the terms of both sequences have the general formx_{i}=x_{1}+(i-1) c quad text { and } quad y_{i}=x_{1}+(i-1) dfor any index i. The difference x_{i}^{2}-y_{i}^{2} can therefore be rewritten asbegin{aligned}x_{i}^{2}-y_{i}^{2} & =left(x_{1}^{2}+2 x_{1}(i-1) c+(i-1)^{2} c^{2}right)-left(x_{1}^{2}+2 x_{1}(i-1) d+(i-1)^{2} d^{2}right)= & =2 x_{1}(i-1)(c-d)+(i-1)^{2}left(c^{2}-d^{2}right) .end{aligned}For the index k, according to the problem statement, the system of equations holds:begin{aligned}& 53=2 x_{1}(k-1)(c-d)+(k-1)^{2}left(c^{2}-d^{2}right), & 78=2 x_{1}(k-2)(c-d)+(k-2)^{2}left(c^{2}-d^{2}right), & 27=2 x_{1} k(c-d)+k^{2}left(c^{2}-d^{2}right) .end{aligned}We will now add these equations or their multiples in a suitable manner. To eliminate the terms with x_{1}, we subtract the sum of equations (2) and (3) from twice equation (1), since the coefficient of 2 x_{1}(c-d) then becomes 2(k-1)-(k-2+k)=0. Since 2 cdot 53-(78+27)=1 and 2(k-1)^{2}-(k-2)^{2}-k^{2}=-2, we obtain the simple equation 1=-2left(c^{2}-d^{2}right), from which we determine c^{2}-d^{2}=-frac{1}{2}. Substituting this into equations (2) and (3), they transform into the formbegin{aligned}& 78=2 x_{1}(k-2)(c-d)-frac{1}{2}(k-2)^{2}, & 27=2 x_{1} k(c-d)-frac{1}{2} k^{2} .end{aligned}To eliminate the terms with x_{1} again, we subtract (k-2)-times equation left(3^{prime}right) from k-times equation left(2^{prime}right); we then solve the resulting equation with the unknown k:begin{aligned}78 k-27(k-2) & =-frac{1}{2}(k-2)^{2} cdot k+frac{1}{2} k^{2} cdot(k-2), 51 k+54 & =-frac{1}{2}left(k^{3}-4 k^{2}+4 kright)+frac{1}{2}left(k^{3}-2 k^{2}right), 0 & =k^{2}-53 k-54, 0 & =(k+1)(k-54) .end{aligned}Since the index k is a natural number, it must be k=54. This solves the problem.Let us add that the problem statement does not require us to investigate whether for the found (unique) value of the index k there exist pairs of sequences satisfying the conditions of the problem. For the sake of interest, let us mention that there are actually infinitely many such pairs of sequences; it is necessary and sufficient that their common first term x_{1} and differences c, d satisfy the conditions c^{2}-d^{2}=-frac{1}{2} and x_{1}(c-d)=frac{55}{4}.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the area of the smallest lattice triangle on a square grid where each grid square has an area of 1 square unit.2.

A triangle must have at least 3 boundary points (one at each vertex).4. Calculating the Area:   - Let ( I = 0 ) (no interior points).   - Let ( B = 3 ) (one point at each vertex of the triangle).   Substituting these values into Pick's Theorem:   [   A = 0 + frac{3}{2} - 1 = frac{3}{2} - 1 = frac{1}{2}   ]5. Verification:   To verify, consider a right triangle with vertices at ((0,0)), ((1,0)), and ((0,1)). This triangle has:   - 3 boundary points (the vertices).   - 0 interior points.

Thus, its square isN^{2}=A^{2} cdot 10^{4}+2 A B cdot 10^{3}+left(2 A C+B^{2}right) 10^{2}+2 B C cdot 10+C^{2}Due to the second digit of N^{2}, A^{2}<3, so A=1. The fourth, fifth digit's place value is 10, for which only the 2 B C cdot 10 and C^{2} terms have an influence. Among them, the first is divisible by 20, so the tens place of C^{2} must be odd. Among the squares of the digits, only C=4 and C=6 are such. In both cases, the units digit is 6, so the last digit of N^{2} is 6.For C=4, the value of the last two terms is 80 B+16 and this is of the form 100 k+56, where k is an integer. From this, 80 B=100 k+40, simplifying to 8 B=10 k+4, and since only 3 cdot 8 and 8 cdot 8 end in 4 in the multiplication table of 8, B=3 or 8. Thus, N=134 or 184. However, in their squares, the first digit is 1 or 3, so they do not match.For C=6, similarly from 120 B+36=100 k+56 we get 12 B=10 k+2, so B=1 or 6, hence N=116 or 166. The first does not match because it is smaller than the above 134. 166 fits: 166^{2}=27556, this is the sought number.Imre Gáti (Pécs, Zipernovszky K. Mechanical Engineering High School II. grade)Remark. Almost every solution arrived at the result in this way. Some elements of the following solution can only be found in the solution of László Pázmándi (Budapest, József A. High School II. grade).II. solution. Based on the given digits, the sought square number N^{2} is 20050 leq N^{2}<30000, so for its positive square root 142 leq N leq 173.The place value of the fourth digit is 10, so it belongs to the \\"two-digit ending\\" of N^{2}, or the number written with its last two digits, which is in a simple relationship with the two-digit ending of the base N as follows. In the following, we will ignore numbers of the form N=5 k because the ending of N^{2} is 00 or 25, so its tens digit is not 5.The two-digit ending of the squares of integers a and b is equal if and only if the difference a^{2}-b^{2} ends in 00, i.e., a^{2}-b^{2}=(a-b)(a+b)=100 k=2^{2} cdot 5^{2} k. Thus, both factors a-b and a+b must be even, because the sum and difference of two integers have the same parity - either both are even or both are odd - now, however, one of them must be even. The product's two 5 factors can only come from one of the factors, because the opposite assumption, that both factors are divisible by 5, leads to a-b=10 m, a+b=10 n and consequently a=5(m+n), which leads to the excluded case. Therefore, either a-b or a+b is divisible by 50. From a-b=50 p we get a=b+50 p, or the two-digit endings of squares repeat every 50 on the integers, and from a+b=50 r we get (a+b) / 2=25 r, or the two-digit endings of squares of numbers that are \\"mirrored\\" about a multiple of 25 are the same, i.e., if a=25 r+s, then b=25 r-s.Accordingly, for example, from the squares of the integers from 1 to 24, not divisible by 5, we can get every two-digit ending different from 00 and 25. Among them, only one has a tens digit of 5, which is the two-digit ending 56 from 16^{2}. This two-digit ending is also given by every base ending in 16+50=66, 50-16=34, and 100-16=84.Accordingly, among the limits of N, 142 and 173, only N=166 can match, and since we have no further data (constraint) on it, it must match."},{"problem":"2.

It follows that (z) is at least 7, and the bound (z^2 < x^2 + y^2) together with the parity constraint force ((x, y) = (5,6)), and thus we get (frac{1}{2} left(5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2right) = 55) as the smallest possible value of (a + b + c), which corresponds to ((a, b, c) = (6,19,30))."},{"problem":"B2.

Therefore, option C is correct.- Option D: Substituting x=frac{2}{3} into the function y=-frac{6}{x}, we get y=-frac{6}{frac{2}{3}} = -9, which does not match the given point (frac{2}{3}, -frac{3}{2}). Therefore, option D is incorrect.Given these analyses, the correct description of the graph of the function y=-frac{6}{x} is that the graph cannot intersect with the coordinate axes.Therefore, the correct answer is: boxed{C}."},{"problem":"Given that f(x) is an odd function on R, f(x)=f(2-x), and when 0leqslant xleqslant 1, f(x)=8^{x}-1, find f(frac{10}{3}).","solution":"To solve the given problem, we follow these steps closely aligned with the provided solution:1. Identify the Properties of f(x): We are given that f(x) is an odd function, which means f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in its domain. Moreover, we have the property f(x) = f(2-x) for all x.2. Derive a Useful Relation: Given that f(x) is an odd function and f(x) = f(2-x), we can deduce that f(x) = -f(x-2). This is because substituting x-2 into the equation f(x) = -f(-x) gives f(x-2) = -f(-(x-2)) = -f(2-x), which is -f(x-2) when applying the given property f(x) = f(2-x).3. Find a Periodic Pattern: By substituting x-2 for x in the derived relation f(x) = -f(x-2), we get f(x-2) = -f(x-4). This implies that f(x) = f(x-4). Thus, f(x) is a periodic function with a period of 4.4. Calculate f(frac{10}{3}): Knowing that f(x) is periodic with a period of 4, we can find that f(frac{10}{3}) = f(frac{10}{3} - 4) = f(-frac{2}{3}). Since f(x) is an odd function, f(-x) = -f(x), so f(-frac{2}{3}) = -f(frac{2}{3}). When 0 leqslant x leqslant 1, f(x) = 8^{x} - 1, so f(frac{2}{3}) = 8^{frac{2}{3}} - 1. Therefore, f(-frac{2}{3}) = -(8^{frac{2}{3}} - 1).5. Final Answer: Putting it all together, we find that f(frac{10}{3}) = -(8^{frac{2}{3}} - 1) = -3.

Represent 30 people with 30 points. If two people are acquaintances, connect a line between their corresponding points, thus forming a simple graph G with these 30 points as the vertex set, satisfying the following conditions:(i) The degree of each vertex in graph G does not exceed 5;(ii) Among any five points in the vertex set of graph G, there are two points not connected by an edge.Let V denote the vertex set of graph G. If A subseteq V, and any two points in set A are not connected by an edge, then A is called an \\"independent set\\" of graph G, and the independent set with the maximum number of elements is called a \\"maximum independent set\\" of graph G.(1) First, prove: In a graph G that satisfies the conditions, the number of elements in the maximum independent set is no less than 6.In fact, let X be a maximum independent set of graph G. By the maximality of |X|, we know that any point in the set V backslash X has a neighbor in the set X. Otherwise, if a in V backslash X has no neighbor in the set X, then we can add a to the set X to form a larger independent set, which is a contradiction. Thus, there are at least |V backslash X| = 30 - |X| edges between the set V backslash X and X.Also, note that the degree of each point in the set X does not exceed 5, so we have30 - |X| leq 5|X|.Therefore, |X| geq 5.If |X| = 5, then by the equality in (1), we know that the 30 - |X| = 25 edges are distributed among the five vertices in the set X, meaning that the neighbor set of each point in the set X is a set of five points in the set V backslash X.Since |V backslash X| = 25, the neighbor sets of any two points in the set X do not intersect.Let X = {a, b, c, d, e}.Now consider the neighbor set of a, denoted asY_{a} = {y_{1}, y_{2}, y_{3}, y_{4}, y_{5}}.By (ii), we know that there are two points in the set Y_{a} that are not connected by an edge, say y_{1}, y_{2}.Since the neighbor sets of any two points in the set X do not intersect, y_{1}, y_{2} cannot be neighbors of b, c, d, e.Thus, {y_{1}, y_{2}, b, c, d, e} is an independent set of graph G with more than 5 elements, which is a contradiction.This proves that |X| geq 6.(2) Next, prove: There exists a graph G that satisfies the conditions, and the number of elements in its maximum independent set does not exceed 6.Partition the set V into point sets V_{1}, V_{2}, V_{3}, such that|V_{i}| = 10 (i=1,2,3).Let V_{1} = {A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{5}, B_{1}, B_{2}, cdots, B_{5}}, and connect the points in the set V_{1} as shown in Figure 3, i.e.,(i) Connect A_{i}A_{i+1} (i=1,2, cdots, 5);(ii) Connect B_{i}B_{i+1} (i=1,2, cdots, 5);(iii) Connect A_{i}B_{i}, A_{i}B_{i+1}, A_{i}B_{i-1} (i=1,2, cdots, 5),where A_{6} = A_{1}, B_{6} = B_{1}, B_{0} = B_{5}.The connection method for point sets V_{2}, V_{3} is the same as that for point set V_{1}, and for any 1 leq i < j leq 3, there are no edges between point sets V_{i} and V_{j}. Then, the degree of any vertex in graph G is 5, and among any five points in graph G, there are always two points not connected by an edge.Now, take any maximum independent set X of graph G.We only need to prove: |V_{1} cap X| leq 2.In fact, since A_{i}, A_{i+1} (i=1,2, cdots, 5) are adjacent, at most two of A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{5} belong to set X.Similarly, at most two of B_{1}, B_{2}, cdots, B_{5} belong to set X.If exactly two of A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{5} belong to set X, say {A_{1}, A_{3}}.Note that the union of the neighbor sets of A_{1} and A_{3} is exactly {B_{1}, B_{2}, cdots, B_{5}}. Therefore, B_{1}, B_{2}, cdots, B_{5} do not belong to set X.Similarly, if exactly two of B_{1}, B_{2}, cdots, B_{5} belong to set X, then A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{5} do not belong to set X. This proves that |V_{1} cap X| leq 2.Similarly, |V_{2} cap X| leq 2, |V_{3} cap X| leq 2.Thus, |X| = |V cap X|= |V_{1} cap X| + |V_{2} cap X| + |V_{3} cap X| leq 6.Therefore, graph G meets the requirements.Combining (1) and (2), we know that the value of k is 6."},{"problem":"Let the function f(x) have the derivative f'(x) = x^3 - 3x + 2.

Selecting 505 numbers 1,5,9,13,17, ldots, 2017 in mathrm{M}, which give a remainder of 1 when divided by four, clearly has the required property, because the difference between any two selected numbers is a multiple of four, thus a composite number. (Since 4 is the smallest composite number, it is not possible to select a larger number of numbers in a similar regular manner.)We will show that it is not possible to select more numbers with the required property from the given set, regardless of the method used. To do this, we first verify the key statement that from any sequence of eight consecutive numbers, at most two numbers can be selected.First, we prove that if we select some number n, from the next seven numbers n+1, n+2, ldots, n+7 at most one can be selected. Indeed, we cannot then select any of the numbers n+2, n+3, n+5, n+7. And from the remaining trio n+1, n+4, n+6, only one number can be selected, because their differences are the prime numbers 2, 3, and 5. This proves the statement about the seven numbers that follow any selected number n. From this, it is clear that no sequence of eight consecutive numbers can contain more than two selected numbers, as we promised to verify.The set mathrm{M} can be divided into the set {1,2, ldots, 10} and 251 subsequent eights.

Given that ABCD is a parallelogram with AB = BD. Let K be a point on AB, different from A, such that KD = AD. Let M be a point symmetric to C with respect to K, and N be a point symmetric to B with respect to A. We need to prove that DM = DN.2. First, observe that angle BKD = 180^circ - angle DKA = 180^circ - angle DAB = angle ABC. This is because angle DKA and angle DAB are supplementary angles in the parallelogram.3. Since KD = AD and AD = BC (opposite sides of the parallelogram are equal), we have DK = BC. Therefore, quadrilateral DKBC is an isosceles trapezoid with DK = BC and BK parallel to DC.4. In the isosceles trapezoid DKBC, triangles DKB and KBC are congruent by the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) criterion:   [   triangle DKB cong triangle KBC   ]   This implies that CK = DB = AB = CD.5. Since M is symmetric to C with respect to K, M is such that KM = KC. Therefore, CM = 2CK = 2DB = 2AB.6. Similarly, since N is symmetric to B with respect to A, N is such that AN = AB. Therefore, NB = 2AB.7. Now, consider the angles:   [   angle NBD = angle KDB = angle BKC = angle DCM   ]   This is because K is the midpoint of CM and N is the midpoint of AB.8. Since DC = DB and angle DCM = angle NBD, triangles CDM and BDN are congruent by the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) criterion:   [   triangle CDM cong triangle BDN   ]9.

This implies that the graph of f(x) is symmetric about the point (1,a+4).The derivative of f(x) is f'(x)=3ax^{2}+6x, and the second derivative is f''(x)=6ax+6. Solving f''(x)=0 gives x=- frac {1}{a}. Since f(- frac {1}{a}+x)+f(- frac {1}{a}-x) is constant, we have - frac {1}{a}=1, which gives a=-1.Thus, f(x)=-x^{3}+3x^{2}+1 and f'(x)=-3x^{2}+6x. Let the point of tangency be (t,-t^{3}+3t^{2}+1). The slope of the tangent line is given by -3t^{2}+6t= frac {-t^{3}+3t^{2}+1}{t}, which simplifies to 2t^{3}-3t^{2}+1=0.Let g(t)=2t^{3}-3t^{2}+1. Then g'(t)=6t^{2}-6t.

Find the value of alpha:   [   left(frac{1}{4}right)^{alpha} = 8   ]   This equation tells us that frac{1}{4} raised to the power of alpha equals 8.

Analyze the function behavior: With alpha = -frac{3}{2}, the function f(x) = x^{-frac{3}{2}} is monotonically decreasing on its domain (0, +infty).

The event B \\"two red caps are next to each other, and the third is separate\\" is favorable in 60 elementary outcomes (10 ways to choose two adjacent places, and the third place must be one of the 6 places not adjacent to the already chosen ones). The total number of ways to choose a triplet is C_{10}^{3}=120. Therefore, the required probability is mathrm{P}(A)+mathrm{P}(B)=frac{70}{120}=frac{7}{12}.2nd method. Number the children in red caps. Consider the events A_{1} \\"the second and third caps are next to each other,\\" A_{2} \\"the first and third caps are next to each other,\\" and A_{3} \\"the first and second caps are next to each other.\\" We need to find the probability of the union:begin{aligned}mathrm{P}left(A_{1} cup A_{2} cup A_{3}right) & =mathrm{P}left(A_{1}right)+mathrm{P}left(A_{2}right)+mathrm{P}left(A_{3}right)- - & mathrm{P}left(A_{1} cap A_{2}right)-mathrm{P}left(A_{1} cap A_{3}right)-mathrm{P}left(A_{2} cap A_{3}right)+mathrm{P}left(A_{1} cap A_{2} cap A_{3}right) .end{aligned}The probability of event A_{1} is 2/9 (if the second cap occupies some place, then for the third cap, nine places remain, but only two of them are next to the second). The probabilities of events A_{2} and A_{3} are the same:mathrm{P}left(A_{1}right)=mathrm{P}left(A_{2}right)=mathrm{P}left(A_{3}right)=frac{2}{9}The event A_{1} cap A_{2} consists in the third cap being between the first and second. The probability of this is frac{2}{9} cdot frac{1}{8}=frac{1}{36}. The same probability applies to the other two pairwise intersections:mathrm{P}left(A_{1} cap A_{2}right)=mathrm{P}left(A_{1} cap A_{3}right)=mathrm{P}left(A_{2} cap A_{3}right)=frac{1}{36} .The event A_{1} cap A_{2} cap A_{3} is impossible: mathrm{P}left(A_{1} cap A_{2} cap A_{3}right)=0. Therefore,mathrm{P}left(A_{1} cup A_{2} cup A_{3}right)=3 cdot frac{2}{9}-3 cdot frac{1}{36}+0=frac{2}{3}-frac{1}{12}=frac{7}{12}The 3rd method is similar to the 2nd method from the second variant. Other methods of solution are also possible.","solution":"Answer: frac{7}{12}.| Evaluation Criteria | Score || :--- | :---: || Solution is complete and correct | 3 || The chosen method is clear from the solution, but only the probability of the event \\"exactly two together\\" is correctly found | 2 || The chosen method is clear from the solution, but only the probability of the event \\"all three together\\" is correctly found | 1 || Solution is missing or incorrect | 0 |X Internet Olympiad in Probability Theory and Statistics.

Each classmate who received the message forwarded it to the same number of classmates. At this point, there were a total of 91 students who received the message. Xiaotong sent the message to ______ classmates.","solution":"To solve this problem, we start by defining x as the number of classmates Xiaotong initially sent the message to. Each of these classmates then forwards the message to x other classmates. This creates a pattern of message distribution that can be represented mathematically.Given that Xiaotong is the first person (not counted as a receiver), the total number of students who received the message includes those Xiaotong sent it to plus those who received it from her classmates. This can be expressed as:[1 + x + x^2 = 91]This equation accounts for the initial message sent by Xiaotong (1 for Xiaotong herself, not as a receiver but as the origin), the x classmates she directly messaged, and the x^2 classmates who received the message from the first group of classmates.Simplifying the equation to solve for x, we get:[x^2 + x - 90 = 0]This is a quadratic equation in the standard form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. To find the value of x, we solve this equation. The solutions to a quadratic equation are given by the formula:[x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}]In our case, a = 1, b = 1, and c = -90. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we find the possible values for x. However, we only consider the solution that makes sense in the context of the problem, which is the number of classmates Xiaotong could have messaged. Negative numbers do not make sense in this context, as you cannot send a message to a negative number of people.Solving the equation, we find that x = 9 is the valid solution, as x = -10 does not make sense in this context. Therefore, Xiaotong sent the message to 9 classmates.Hence, the answer is: boxed{9}."},{"problem":"293.

Therefore, this statement does not exclusively describe a parallelogram.- Statement B: A quadrilateral with equal diagonals does not necessarily make it a rectangle. For instance, an isosceles trapezoid can also have equal diagonals. The key property of a rectangle is that all angles are right angles, which is not guaranteed by having equal diagonals alone.- Statement C: A quadrilateral with perpendicular and equal diagonals that bisect each other indeed describes a square, due to the properties of a square that include perpendicular bisecting diagonals of equal length. However, this statement specifies a square, not a general quadrilateral characteristic.- Statement D: A parallelogram with one diagonal bisecting an interior angle is indeed a rhombus.

Since a square has four sides of equal length, one square will have a side length of frac{x}{4} and the other square will have a side length of frac{10-x}{4}.The area of a square with side length ell is ell^{2}. Therefore, one square will have an area of left(frac{x}{4}right)^{2}=frac{x^{2}}{16}, while the other square will have an area of left(frac{10-x}{4}right)^{2}=frac{100-20 x+x^{2}}{16}.b) Let S(x) be the sum of the areas of the two squares. From the previous part, we haveS(x)=frac{x^{2}}{16}+frac{100-20 x+x^{2}}{16}=frac{100-20 x+2 x^{2}}{16}=frac{1}{8} x^{2}-frac{5}{4} x+frac{25}{4}which is a quadratic function.

Well, we claim that to minimize the area with nine cuts (i.e., creating ten squares), it is necessary that all pieces of rope be equal. To show this, consider the following argument: if two of the ten pieces of rope were different, it would be possible to reduce the area by cutting the pieces of rope so that these two were equal (we are using the previous part).

Rewriting the LCM:   - Rewrite (text{lcm}(x_{i+1}, x_i) = frac{x_i x_{i+1}}{gcd(x_{i+1}, x_i)}).   - Since (gcd(x_{i+1}, x_i) geq 2), we conclude that the inequality must hold, and therefore all integers must be equal.4.

Given the sequence (a_n)_{n ge 1} such that a_n > 1 and a_{n+1}^2 ge a_n a_{n+2} for any n ge 1, we need to show that the sequence (x_n)_{n ge 1} given by x_n = log_{a_n} a_{n+1} is convergent and compute its limit.2. First, take the logarithm of both sides of the inequality a_{n+1}^2 ge a_n a_{n+2}:   [   log(a_{n+1}^2) ge log(a_n a_{n+2})   ]   Using the properties of logarithms, this can be rewritten as:   [   2 log(a_{n+1}) ge log(a_n) + log(a_{n+2})   ]3. Dividing both sides by log(a_{n+1}) (noting that log(a_{n+1}) > 0 since a_{n+1} > 1), we get:   [   2 ge frac{log(a_n)}{log(a_{n+1})} + frac{log(a_{n+2})}{log(a_{n+1})}   ]   Recognizing that frac{log(a_n)}{log(a_{n+1})} = log_{a_{n+1}} a_n = frac{1}{x_n} and frac{log(a_{n+2})}{log(a_{n+1})} = log_{a_{n+1}} a_{n+2} = x_{n+1}, we can rewrite the inequality as:   [   2 ge x_{n+1} + frac{1}{x_n}   ]4. We also have the inequality x_n + frac{1}{x_n} ge 2 for any positive real number x_n (this follows from the AM-GM inequality). Therefore, we have:   [   x_n + frac{1}{x_n} ge 2 ge x_{n+1} + frac{1}{x_n}   ]5. From the above inequality, it follows that:   [   x_n ge x_{n+1}   ]   This shows that (x_n)_{n ge 1} is a decreasing sequence.6. Since x_n is a decreasing sequence and x_n > 0 (because a_n > 1 implies x_n > 0), the sequence (x_n)_{n ge 1} is bounded below by 0. Therefore, by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, (x_n)_{n ge 1} is convergent.7. Let L be the limit of the sequence (x_n)_{n ge 1}. Taking the limit on both sides of the inequality 2 ge x_{n+1} + frac{1}{x_n}, we get:   [   2 ge L + frac{1}{L}   ]   Similarly, taking the limit on both sides of the inequality x_n + frac{1}{x_n} ge 2, we get:   [   L + frac{1}{L} ge 2   ]8. Combining these two inequalities, we have:   [   2 ge L + frac{1}{L} ge 2   ]   This implies:   [   L + frac{1}{L} = 2   ]9. Solving the equation L + frac{1}{L} = 2, we multiply both sides by L:   [   L^2 + 1 = 2L   ]   Rearranging, we get:   [   L^2 - 2L + 1 = 0   ]   Factoring, we find:   [   (L - 1)^2 = 0   ]   Therefore:   [   L = 1   ]The final answer is boxed{1}."},{"problem":"At the beginning of the winter, there were at least 66 students registered in a ski class.

Since the |sin x| graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis and repeats every 2pi, the line passing through the origin will intersect the graph of f(x) in the intervals [0, pi] and [pi, 2pi]. However, because the problem states that there are only three intersection points and one of them is at the origin, the other two must be within the second period of |sin x|, which is (pi, 2pi).For x in the interval (pi, 2pi), the graph of |sin x| coincides with -sin x since the sine function is negative there. Therefore, the derivative f'(x) in this interval is -cos x, representing the slope of the tangent line to the graph at any point.To find the point where the tangent line passes through the origin (which is the second intersection we're interested in, besides the intersection at the origin), we set the slope of this line equal to the slope of the line connecting the origin with the point (alpha, -sin alpha) on the graph. The slope of the latter is frac{-sin alpha}{alpha}.Setting the two slopes equal, we have:-cos alpha = frac{-sin alpha}{alpha},which simplifies toalpha cos alpha = sin alpha.Dividing both sides by cos alpha, we obtain:alpha = tan alpha.The only solution to alpha = tan alpha within (pi, 2pi) must be where alpha corresponds to a point where the line passing through the origin is tangent to the graph of -sin x. This point is where alpha equals the x-coordinate of the intersection point, which is also the maximum x-coordinate we seek.We now substitute alpha with tan alpha in the expression we're asked to find:frac {(1+alpha^{2})sin 2alpha}{alpha} = frac {(1+tan^{2} alpha)sin 2alpha}{tan alpha}.Using the Pythagorean identity 1 + tan^{2} alpha = frac{1}{cos^{2} alpha} and the double angle identity for sine sin 2alpha = 2 sin alpha cos alpha, we substitute and simplify:frac {(1+tan^{2} alpha)sin 2alpha}{tan alpha} = frac{frac{1}{cos^{2} alpha} cdot 2 sin alpha cos alpha}{tan alpha} = frac{2 sin alpha}{sin alpha} = 2.Hence, the value is boxed{2}."},{"problem":"3.

It is known that the minimum number of moves it takes for the knight to reach the upper right corner is equal to the minimum number of moves it takes to reach the lower right corner. Find n.#","solution":"Let n be even. In this case, the left lower field has the same color as the right upper one, while the right lower field has a different color. After each move, the knight lands on a field of the opposite color. Therefore, any path from the left lower corner to the right upper one consists of an even number of moves, while the path to the right lower corner consists of an odd number of moves. Consequently, their lengths are different.: Let n=4 k+1. Then, by making moves alternately along the fields of the two lower rows, the knight will reach the right lower corner in 2 k moves.We will show that the path to the right upper corner is longer. Each move shifts the knight by a total of 3 fields horizontally and vertically. Even moving consistently to the right-up, the knight will move a total of 6 k fields in 2 k moves. The total distance horizontally and vertically from the left lower corner to the right upper one is 2 n-2 = 8 k > 6 k. Therefore, the shortest path to the right upper field is longer.Let n=4 k-1. Then, the right lower field can be reached in 2 k moves as follows: the first move is one field to the right and two up, the second move is one field to the right and two down, and then, as in the previous case, move alternately along the fields of the two lower rows. It is impossible to reach the destination in fewer moves.Indeed, the knight needs to move n-1=4 k-2 cells to the right, and each move can shift it a maximum of two cells to the right. Therefore, the number of moves is at least 2 k-1. But after 2 k-1 moves, the knight will land on a field of the opposite color, while in our case, the right lower corner has the same color as the left lower corner, so at least one more move is needed, meaning the number of moves is at least 2 k.The maximum total shift to the right and up in 2 k moves remains 6 k. The total distance horizontally and vertically from the left lower field to the right upper one is 2 n-2 = 8 k-4. For k>2, this is greater than 6 k. For k=1 (n=3), it is easy to check all options and see that this case does not work. However, for k=2 (n=7), both shortest paths consist of four moves, and this is also easy to verify.## Answern=7."},{"problem":"7. (10 points) There are 6 bricks placed as shown in the figure.

Upper Bound:   - We start by considering the expression ( E(x, y, z) = sqrt{x(y + 3)} + sqrt{y(z + 3)} + sqrt{z(x + 3)} ).   - To find an upper bound, we use the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality.

One round of the wheel with a circumference of 10 mathrm{~cm} corresponds to 5 rounds of the fourth wheel, and one round of the wheel with a circumference of 6 mathrm{~cm} corresponds to 3 rounds of the smallest wheel.The total number of rounds the smallest wheel must make until we return to the initial situation must be a multiple of 3, 5, and 7. The smallest number that is a multiple of 3, 5, and 7 is 105. In total, the wheels from largest to smallest then make 15, 21, and 35 rounds. This means there are at most 15 + 21 + 35 = 71 whistles, but there might be fewer, as it is possible that two arrows point upwards simultaneously.Exactly halfway through the 105 rounds of the fourth wheel, the other wheels have made 7 frac{1}{2}, 10 frac{1}{2}, and 17 frac{1}{2} rounds.

This situation occurs after 52 frac{1}{2} - 35 and 52 frac{1}{2} + 35 rounds of the fourth wheel, counted from the initial situation.

In these situations, the second wheel does not point upwards, since 21 and 42 are not multiples of 5.Finally, the second and third wheels point upwards simultaneously after 52 frac{1}{2} - 45, 52 frac{1}{2} - 30, 52 frac{1}{2} - 15, 52 frac{1}{2} + 15, 52 frac{1}{2} + 30, and 52 frac{1}{2} + 45 rounds of the fourth wheel. In these situations, the first wheel does not point upwards, since 15, 30, and 45 are not multiples of 7.In total, there are 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 situations where exactly two of the arrows point upwards.

Everyone wants to buy one ticket. What fraction of the possible line-ups allow the cashier to sell the tickets without running out of change?","solution":"I. solution. There is no deadlock if, no matter how long we look at the queue, at least as many people are waiting with 100 forints as with 200 forints.Let's denote the former by s and the latter by k, and calculate how many permutations of four s and four k letters do not result in a deadlock. In a good order, the first person must pay with a 100 forint note, and the last with a 200 forint note, so any good order is of the form s k.Let's group the good orders according to the position of the first viewer who wants to pay with 200 forints. If this is K, then 2 leq K leq 5.(i) K=5. There is only one such order: s s s k k k k, and this is clearly good.(ii) K=4: s s k{ }^{k} ldots ldots ldots. By writing the fourth s letter in any of the three possible positions, we get a good order, so in this case, we get 3 good orders.(iii) K=3: s s k-— — — k. The remaining two s letters can be written in binom{4}{2}=6 ways into two of the four free positions. Out of these 6 orders, only 1 is not good, the one where the two s letters are in the last two free positions. In this case, we get 5 good orders.(iv) K=2: s k qquad k. The third position can only be filled with an s letter, otherwise, the queue would get stuck: s k s k. This essentially leads us to the previous case, and we get another 5 good orders.Having examined all possibilities, we have found 14 good orders. Since we can choose the four positions for the s letters out of 8 in binom{8}{4}=70 ways, the cashier can issue the tickets without deadlock in frac{14}{70}=frac{1}{5} of all orders.II. solution. Using the notation from the previous solution, we now count the \\"bad\\" orders. A deadlock occurs when an equal number of s and k letters appear before the deadlock, and a k letter stands at the deadlock position. The deadlock itself thus occurred at the (2 m+1)-th position (m=1,2,3,4).Now let's modify such sequences as follows: if the deadlock occurs at the (2 m+1)-th position, then we swap the s letters for k letters and the k letters for s letters in the first (2 m+1) positions. We do not change the letters in the positions after the deadlock.s s k k kleft|_rightarrow quad k k s s sright|qquadThis way, we get a sequence consisting of 5 s and 3 k letters. Conversely, if we consider a (5 s, 3 k) sequence, we can uniquely obtain a bad sequence from it: since there are more s than k, there will be a first position where the s letters outnumber the k letters, and this will occur at some odd position. Swapping s leftrightarrow k up to this position, we get a bad sequence.The number of bad sequences is thus binom{8}{3}=56, and the number of good sequences is binom{8}{4}-56=14.Based on the work of Csötönyi Nóra (Bonyhád, Petőfi S. Gimn., 10. o.t.)Remarks. 1. The above counting can also be given a geometric interpretation: each sequence can be represented by a broken line starting from the origin: for an s letter, we step forward by the mathbf{f}(1,1) vector, and for a k letter, by the mathbf{l}(1,-1) vector.Thus, we get broken lines starting from the origin and ending at the (8 ; 0) point. A path is bad if it touches or crosses the y=-1 line. For the \\"bad\\" broken lines, perform the mathbf{f} leftrightarrow mathbf{l} swap up to the first intersection point with the y=-1 line, and we get a path starting from the origin and ending at the (8,2) point. There are binom{8}{3} such paths.2. Another, more intuitive way to execute the above \\"reflection\\" and the corresponding counting is as follows:Reflect the part of a bad path (0,0) rightarrow(8 ; 0) after its first intersection with the y=-1 line over the y=-1 line. This way, we get a path starting from (0,0) and ending at (8,-2), consisting of (3 s, 5 k). Conversely, any such path clearly intersects the y=-1 line; reflecting the part of the path after the first intersection point, we get a bad sequence.Thus, the number of bad sequences is binom{8}{3}.3. By any of the above methods, we find that if 2 n customers are waiting in front of the cashier, with half of them having 100 forints and the other half 200 forints, then the total number of orders is binom{2 n}{n}, and the number of bad ones is binom{2 n}{n-1}.In this case, the cashier can issue the tickets without deadlock in frac{binom{2 n}{n}-binom{2 n}{n-1}}{binom{2 n}{n}}=frac{1}{n+1} of all orders.Using the reflection method, we can also get an answer to the question of the problem if the number of people waiting with 100 forints and 200 forints is different. If n viewers are waiting with 100 forints and m with 200 forints (n geq m), then we similarly find (Fig. 3) that the number of bad orders is binom{n+m}{m-1}.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_69853f92c6134195fcb5g-2.jpg?height=952&width=1216&top_left_y=126&top_left_x=454)"},{"problem":"Given that in triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C are denoted as a, b, and c respectively, and it is known that sin B(tan A + tan C) = tan Atan C.(1) Prove that: b^{2} = ac;  (2) If a = 2c = 2, find the area of triangle ABC.","solution":"Solution:  (1) Proof: In triangle ABC, since sin B(tan A + tan C) = tan Atan C,  we have sin Bleft( frac{sin A}{cos A} + frac{sin C}{cos C}right) = frac{sin A}{cos A} cdot frac{sin C}{cos C},  thus sin B(sin Acos C + cos Asin C) = sin Asin C;  Also, since A + B + C = pi,  we have sin (A + C) = sin B,  therefore, sin^2 B = sin Asin C,  by the Law of Sines, we can derive that b^{2} = ac;  (2) Since a = 2c = 2,  we have a = 2, c = 1,  and since b^{2} = ac, we have b = sqrt{2};  By the Law of Cosines, we get cos B = frac{a^{2} + c^{2} - b^{2}}{2ac} = frac{3}{4},  and since 0 < B < pi, we have sin B = frac{sqrt{7}}{4};  Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is S = frac{1}{2}acsin B = boxed{frac{sqrt{7}}{4}}."},{"problem":"[b]p1.[/b] Is it possible to put 9 numbers 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 in a circle in a way such that the sum of any three circularly consecutive numbers is divisible by 3 and is, moreover:a) greater than 9 ? b) greater than 15?[b]p2.[/b] You can cut the figure below along the sides of the small squares into several (at least two) identical pieces.

What is the probability that P_8 = P?","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   - We start with a point ( P ) at the center of square ( ABCD ).   - A sequence of points ( {P_n} ) is generated by reflecting ( P_i ) over one of the four sides ( AB, BC, CD, DA ) chosen uniformly at random.   - We need to find the probability that ( P_8 = P ).2. Reflection Properties:   - Reflecting ( P ) over any side of the square will move it to the opposite side of the square.   - Reflecting twice over the same side will return ( P ) to its original position.   - Therefore, to return to the center after 8 reflections, each pair of parallel sides must be reflected an even number of times.3. Counting Valid Sequences:   - We need to count the number of sequences of 8 reflections that result in ( P ) returning to the center.   - Let ( a ) be a reflection over ( AB ) and ( b ) be a reflection over ( CD ). Similarly, let ( c ) be a reflection over ( BC ) and ( d ) be a reflection over ( DA ).   - We need an even number of ( a ) and ( b ) reflections and an even number of ( c ) and ( d ) reflections.4. Combinatorial Analysis:   - We can break down the problem into horizontal and vertical reflections.   - For horizontal reflections (over ( AB ) and ( CD )), we need an even number of reflections. The same applies to vertical reflections (over ( BC ) and ( DA )).   - We need to count the number of ways to distribute 8 reflections such that both horizontal and vertical reflections are even.5. Calculating the Number of Valid Sequences:   - For horizontal reflections, the valid sequences are those with 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 reflections over ( AB ) and ( CD ).   - Similarly, for vertical reflections, the valid sequences are those with 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 reflections over ( BC ) and ( DA ).   - The total number of ways to distribute 8 reflections into horizontal and vertical reflections is given by the binomial coefficient ( binom{8}{k} ) where ( k ) is the number of horizontal reflections.6. Combining Horizontal and Vertical Reflections:   - We need to combine the valid sequences of horizontal and vertical reflections.   - The total number of valid sequences is the product of the number of valid horizontal sequences and the number of valid vertical sequences.7. Probability Calculation:   - The total number of possible sequences of 8 reflections is ( 4^8 ) since each reflection can be over any of the 4 sides.   - The number of valid sequences is given by the sum of the products of the binomial coefficients for even numbers of reflections.8. Final Calculation:   - The number of valid sequences is:     [     sum_{k text{ even}} binom{8}{k} cdot binom{8}{k}     ]   - This simplifies to:     [     binom{8}{0}^2 + binom{8}{2}^2 + binom{8}{4}^2 + binom{8}{6}^2 + binom{8}{8}^2     ]   - Calculating each term:     [     binom{8}{0} = 1, quad binom{8}{2} = 28, quad binom{8}{4} = 70, quad binom{8}{6} = 28, quad binom{8}{8} = 1     ]     [     1^2 + 28^2 + 70^2 + 28^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 784 + 4900 + 784 + 1 = 6470     ]   - The probability is:     [     frac{6470}{4^8} = frac{6470}{65536} = frac{1225}{16384}     ]The final answer is (boxed{frac{1225}{16384}})"},{"problem":"Simplify first, then evaluate: 2ab^2-[6a^3b+2(ab^2-frac{1}{2}a^3b)], where a=-2 and b=frac{1}{5}.","solution":"To simplify and then evaluate the expression 2ab^2-[6a^3b+2(ab^2-frac{1}{2}a^3b)] given a=-2 and b=frac{1}{5}, we follow these steps:1.

Let AB=AC=x, angle OAB=varphi. By the cosine rule for triangles OAB and OAC, we have:begin{aligned}& 4^{2}=x^{2}+6^{2}-12 x cos varphi & 8^{2}=x^{2}+6^{2}-12 x sin varphiend{aligned}from whichbegin{aligned}12 x cos varphi & =x^{2}+20 12 x sin varphi & =x^{2}-28end{aligned}Squaring these inequalities and adding them, we get a quadratic equation in x^{2}: 144 x^{2}=2 x^{4}-16 x^{2}+1184, x^{4}-80 x^{2}+592=0. The roots of this equation arex_{1,2}^{2}=40 pm 12 sqrt{7}Note that 40-12 sqrt{7}<36, and in this case x<AO, meaning point O will not lie inside the triangle, so S=frac{x^{2}}{2}=20+6 sqrt{7}.Plan for the third solution.

By a simple calculation of angles, we see that angle YCZ=2 angle ACB=90^{circ}, angle XBZ=2 angle ABC=90^{circ}, angle XAY=2 angle BAC=180^{circ}.The area of pentagon XYCZB is twice the area of triangle ABC.

Given that AB is parallel to CD, we can use the slope formula to equate the slopes of AB and CD:- The slope of AB is calculated as frac{5-7}{7-1} = frac{-2}{6} = -frac{1}{3}.- Assuming the slope of CD is the same (since AB parallel CD), we have frac{y-1}{x-4} = -frac{1}{3}.This equation simplifies to x + 3y = 7.Since AC is perpendicular to BD, their slopes are negative reciprocals of each other:- The slope of AC is frac{1-7}{4-1} = frac{-6}{3} = -2.- The slope of BD, being perpendicular, would satisfy frac{y-5}{x-7} times (-2) = -1.This simplifies to x - 2y = -3.Solving the system of equations x + 3y = 7 and x - 2y = -3, we find:- Multiplying the second equation by 3 gives 3x - 6y = -9.- Adding this to the first equation gives 4x = -2, so x = -frac{1}{2}.- Substituting x back into one of the equations, say x + 3y = 7, gives -frac{1}{2} + 3y = 7, which simplifies to 3y = frac{15}{2}, so y = frac{5}{2}.Therefore, the coordinates of point D are boxed{(1,2)}.# Part (2): Calculating the Area of Trapezoid ABCDTo find the area of the trapezoid, we first calculate the lengths of AC and BD:- |AC| = sqrt{(4-1)^2+(1-7)^2} = sqrt{9+36} = sqrt{45} = 3sqrt{5}.- |BD| = sqrt{(7-1)^2+(5-2)^2} = sqrt{36+9} = sqrt{45} = 3sqrt{5}.Since AC is perpendicular to BD, we can treat one as the base and the other as the height for calculating the area of the trapezoid ABCD. The area formula for a trapezoid when one side is perpendicular to the other is S = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}:- Substituting |AC| and |BD| into the formula gives S = frac{1}{2} times 3sqrt{5} times 3sqrt{5} = frac{1}{2} times 45 = frac{45}{2}.Therefore, the area of trapezoid ABCD is boxed{frac{45}{2}}."},{"problem":"107. What dependence should exist between the radii R and r and the distance d between the centers of two circles, so that a triangle can be constructed that is inscribed in the first circle and circumscribed around the second circle","solution":"107. Let O and o be the centers of the circles with radii R and r, respectively, and Oo = d. Let ABC be a triangle inscribed in the first circle and circumscribed around the second circle (Fig. 235). Extend Oo to intersect the circumcircle of triangle ABC at points M and N. Then OM = R + d, ON = R - d. Let D be the second point of intersection of line Co with the circumcircle; in this case, we havebegin{gathered}oC cdot oD = oM cdot oN = = (R + d)(R - d) = = R^2 - d^2end{gathered}Now let's find another expression for oC cdot oD. Draw the diameter DE of the circumcircle and the segments DA, DB, and oA. Since CD is the angle bisector of angle C of triangle ABC, we haveDA = DBFurthermore, triangle AoD is isosceles; indeed, since angle DAB = angle DCB = frac{1}{2} angle C and angle oAB = frac{1}{2} angle A, we haveangle oAD = angle oAB + angle BAD = frac{angle A}{2} + frac{angle C}{2}On the other hand,angle AoD = angle oAC + angle oCA = frac{angle A}{2} + frac{angle C}{2}(as the external angle of triangle AoC). Therefore, AD = oD, and hence BD = oD.Now drop a perpendicular oP from point o to side AC of triangle ABC. In the right triangles CoP and EBD, angle DEB = angle DCB = angle oCP; therefore, these triangles are similar, and frac{Co}{oP} = frac{DE}{DB}, so oC cdot DB = oP cdot DE = r cdot 2R. Hence,oC cdot oD = 2Rr.Comparing this relation with the one obtained earlier, we haveR^2 - d^2 = 2Rrord^2 = R^2 - 2Rrorfrac{1}{R+d} + frac{1}{R-d} = frac{1}{r}Conversely, let the radii R and r of the given circles and the distance between their centers be related by the equation (*). Then R^2 - 2Rr geq 0, from which R geq 2r. Therefore, there exists a triangle ABC such that the circumcircle and the incircle of this triangle have radii R and r (see problem 106b)). But then the distance between the centers of the circumcircle and the incircle of triangle ABC must, by the proven result, equal sqrt{R^2 - 2Rr} = d, from which it follows that there exists a triangle (congruent to triangle ABC) inscribed in one of the given circles and circumscribed around the other.If the radii of two circles and the distance between their centers do not satisfy the relation d^2 = R^2 - 2Rr, then there does not exist a triangle inscribed in one circle and circumscribed around the other. If this relation holds, then there are infinitely many such triangles: if from an arbitrary point C on the larger circle, we draw chords AC and CB of this circle that are tangent to the smaller circle, it can be shown that the chord AB will also be tangent to this circle, and triangle ABC will be inscribed in one circle and circumscribed around the other."},{"problem":"Given the height 455 as shown in Figure 3, the lines AB and AC are tangent to the circle odot O at points B and C respectively.

To do this, we note that if (x, y, n) is a solution, then modulo 3, we haven^{2} equiv -x^{4} - 2x^{2}y^{2} - y^{4} equiv -left(x^{2} + y^{2}right)^{2} quad (bmod 3)Thus, n^{2} + (x^{2} + y^{2})^{2} is divisible by 3. Since a square is 0 or 1 modulo 3, the only way a sum of squares can be divisible by 3 is if each term is. Therefore, n and x^{2} + y^{2} are divisible by 3. Similarly, it follows that x and y are divisible by 3.By substituting back into the equation, we deduce that 3^{4} = 81 divides n^{2} and thus 9 divides n, so left(frac{x}{3}, frac{y}{3}, frac{n}{9}right) is another solution. If we had a solution with x, y, or n non-zero (and by changing them to their opposites, which does not change the values of the squares, which are positive), we could obtain a strictly decreasing sequence of natural numbers, which is absurd (this is the principle of infinite descent).We conclude that the only potential solution is (0,0,0). Conversely, we note that (x, y, n) = (0,0,0) works (both sides give 0).The unique solution to the equation is therefore (0,0,0).Graders' Comments: In general, the solutions that addressed the problem were quite successful. Some attempted approaches such as a study modulo 8 or a rewriting of the equation; here it did not lead to a solution, but these were good ideas that can still be useful on similar problems. We note recurring errors regarding the principle of infinite descent: a number of solutions conclude that there are no solutions by infinite descent. In reality, infinite descent allows us to conclude that there are no non-zero solutions, but it does not exclude the solution (0,0,0) a priori (and indeed it works). On this point, a number of solutions conclude that (0,0,0) is the only possible solution, without verifying it. Even if it seems obvious here, verifying the solution is essential, as infinite descent guarantees that it is the only possible solution, but not that it is indeed a solution."},{"problem":"4.

A and B alternately discard a card face up, starting with A. The game when the sum of the discards is first divisible by 2n + 1, and the last person to discard wins. What is the probability that A wins if neither player makes a mistake? Solution","solution":": 0. Fairly easy. B always wins irrespective of the deal. The stuff about random shuffling and probabilities is a red herring. Note first that both players have perfect information (because each can see his own cards and the discards and hence deduce the other player's hand). A cannot win on his first play. Now suppose it is B's turn. Each card B might play will give a different total and so requires a different card for A to win on the following move. But B has one more card than A, so he can choose a card which does not allow A to win on the next move. Thus B can always play so that A does not win on the following move. But one player must win after 2n plays or less, so it must be B.

What remainder can this prime give when divided by 240?","solution":"Solution. We know that n is a positive integer, and 2^{n}+1 is a prime number. If there existed an odd prime number p such that p mid n, then there would be an x in mathbb{N} such that n=p cdot x.Thus, 2^{n}+1=2^{p cdot x}+1=left(2^{x}right)^{p}+1^{p}. According to the known identity,2^{x}+1 midleft(2^{x}right)^{p}+1^{p}and 1<2^{x}+1<2^{n}+1, so it would be a proper divisor, meaning 2^{n}+1 could not be a prime number. We have reached a contradiction, so n cannot have an odd divisor, hence n=2^{k}.Let's examine the remainders when dividing by 240 for exponents of this form:begin{aligned}& 2^{2^{0}}+1=3 equiv 3 quad(bmod 240) & 2^{2^{1}}+1=5 equiv 5 quad(bmod 240) & 2^{2^{2}}+1=17 equiv 17 quad(bmod 240) & 2^{2^{3}}+1=257 equiv 17 quad(bmod 240) & 2^{2^{4}}+1=65537 equiv 17 quad(bmod 240)end{aligned}Conjecture: the remainder will always be 17 from this point onward.240=2^{4} cdot 3 cdot 5So we need to examine what remainders the numbers of the form 2^{2^{k}}+1 give when divided by 2^{4}, 3, and 5.Let A=2^{2^{k}}+1.If k geq 2, then 2^{4} mid 2^{2^{k}}, so 2^{4}left|A-1 Rightarrow 2^{4}right| A-1-16 Rightarrow 2^{4} mid A-17.begin{aligned}A= & 2^{2^{k}}+1=(3-1)^{2^{k}}+1 equiv(-1)^{2^{k}}+1 equiv 2 quad(bmod 3) Longrightarrow & Longrightarrow 3|A-2 Longrightarrow 3| A-2-15 Longrightarrow 3 mid A-17end{aligned}The last digits of powers of 2 for positive exponents are 2,4,8,6,2,4,8,6 and so on.

Given that the sequence {a_{n}} is a Fibonacci sequence, and the sequence {b_{n}} satisfies {b_{n+3}}+{(-1)^{{a_n}}}{b_n}=n, if the sum of the first 12 terms of the sequence {b_{n}} is 86, then b_{1}+b_{2}=____.","solution":"To solve for b_{1}+b_{2} given the conditions of the Fibonacci sequence and the sequence {b_{n}}, we proceed as follows:Step 1: Analyze the Fibonacci SequenceThe Fibonacci sequence starts with 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ldots. Noticing the pattern, every third term starting from a_{3} is even, while the other two are odd.

Therefore, we have:   [ 2^2 = 4 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2. ]   The only solution in non-negative integers is:   [ (a, b, c, d) = (1, 1, 1, 1) ]   and its permutations.To sum up, all solutions are:[ (2^x, 0, 0, 0), (2^x, 2^x, 0, 0), (2^x, 2^x, 2^x, 2^x) ]and their permutations where (x in mathbb{Z}^0).The final answer is ( boxed{ (2^x, 0, 0, 0), (2^x, 2^x, 0, 0), (2^x, 2^x, 2^x, 2^x) } ) and their permutations where (x in mathbb{Z}^0)."},{"problem":"The target board shown in the figure consists of three concentric circles and two perpendicular lines that pass through the centers of the circles.

How many ways can we choose a nonempty subset of the buildings such that there is an odd number of buildings between each pair of buildings in the subset?[i]Proposed by Yiming Zheng","solution":"1. Identify the problem constraints: We need to choose a nonempty subset of buildings such that there is an odd number of buildings between each pair of buildings in the subset. 2. Classify the buildings: There are 16 buildings, which we can label as ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_{16} ). We can classify these buildings into two categories: even-numbered buildings (( B_2, B_4, ldots, B_{16} )) and odd-numbered buildings (( B_1, B_3, ldots, B_{15} )).3. Subset selection:    - If we choose buildings from the even-numbered set, the buildings are ( B_2, B_4, B_6, ldots, B_{16} ).    - If we choose buildings from the odd-numbered set, the buildings are ( B_1, B_3, B_5, ldots, B_{15} ).4. Ensuring odd gaps:    - For the even-numbered buildings, the gap between any two buildings ( B_{2i} ) and ( B_{2j} ) (where ( i < j )) is ( 2(j-i) ), which is always even.    - For the odd-numbered buildings, the gap between any two buildings ( B_{2i-1} ) and ( B_{2j-1} ) (where ( i < j )) is ( 2(j-i) ), which is also always even.5. Counting subsets:    - For each of the 8 even-numbered buildings, we can either include or exclude it in our subset. This gives us ( 2^8 ) subsets.   - Similarly, for each of the 8 odd-numbered buildings, we can either include or exclude it in our subset. This also gives us ( 2^8 ) subsets.6. Combining the cases:    - We have two independent cases (choosing from even-numbered buildings or odd-numbered buildings), so we add the number of subsets from each case: ( 2^8 + 2^8 ).7. Subtracting the empty set:    - The total number of subsets is ( 2^8 + 2^8 = 2 cdot 2^8 = 2^9 = 512 ).   - However, we counted the empty set twice (once in each case), so we need to subtract 2 to account for this overcounting.8.

The products processed (unit: pieces) are divided into four grades A, B, C, D according to the standard. The processing business agreement is as follows: for grade A, grade B, and grade C products, the factory charges processing fees of 90 yuan, 50 yuan, and 20 yuan per piece, respectively; for grade D products, the factory has to compensate for raw material loss fees of 50 yuan per piece. The factory has two branches, Branch A and Branch B, that can undertake the processing business. The processing cost for Branch A is 25 yuan per piece, and for Branch B is 20 yuan per piece. To decide which branch should undertake the processing business, the factory conducted a trial processing of 100 pieces of this product at each branch and compiled the frequency distribution of the product grades as follows:  Frequency distribution table of product grades for Branch A:  | Grade | A  | B  | C  | D  ||-------|------|------|------|------|| Frequency | 40 | 20 | 20 | 20 |Frequency distribution table of product grades for Branch B:  | Grade | A  | B  | C  | D  ||-------|------|------|------|------|| Frequency | 28 | 17 | 34 | 21 |(1) Estimate the probability that a product processed by Branch A and Branch B is a grade A product, respectively.

To analyze the monotonic behavior of f'(x), we can further differentiate to get the second derivative f''(x) = e^x - 1.    When x  0, f''(x) > 0 indicating that f'(x) is concave up and increasing. Consequently, f'(x) is monotonically decreasing on the interval (-infty, 0) and monotonically increasing on the interval (0, +infty).    At x = 0, we find that f'(0) = e^0 - 0 - 1 = 0. Since f'(x) transitions from decreasing to increasing at this point, it achieves a local minimum value, with no local maximum value. Therefore, we can write the result as: f'(x) has a local minimum at x = 0 and no local maximum.(II) Since y=g(x) is symmetric to y=f(x) with respect to the origin, we have g(x) = -f(-x) = -e^{-x} + frac{1}{2}x^2 + x - 1. Consider the function F(x) = f(x)-g(x) = f(x) + f(-x) = e^x + e^{-x} - x^2 - 2 for x ge 0.    Differentiating F(x), we get F'(x) = e^x - e^{-x} - 2x. The second derivative F''(x) = e^x + e^{-x} - 2 is always non-negative. Therefore, F'(x) is monotonically increasing on [0, +infty), and since F'(0) = e^0 - e^0 - 2 cdot 0 = 0, it follows that F'(x) ge 0 for x ge 0. Hence, F(x) is monotonically increasing on [0, +infty).    Since F(x) is increasing and F(0) = e^0 + e^0 - 0 - 2 = 0, for x > 0, we have F(x) > F(0) = 0. Therefore, f(x) > g(x) for x > 0.

Given that the focus of the parabola y^{2}=4x is F, a light ray parallel to the x-axis is emitted from point A(5,4), reflects off point B on the parabola, and then exits through another point C on the parabola. Find the value of |BC|.","solution":"To solve this problem, we follow a step-by-step approach based on the given solution:1. Identify the Focus of the Parabola: Given the equation of the parabola y^{2}=4x, we can deduce the focus F of the parabola. The standard form of a parabola's equation is y^2=4ax, where a is the distance from the vertex to the focus. Therefore, for y^{2}=4x, we have a=1, which means the focus F is at (1,0).2. Find Point B on the Parabola: The light ray emitted from point A(5,4) is parallel to the x-axis, which means it has an equation of y=4. Substituting y=4 into the equation of the parabola y^{2}=4x, we find the x-coordinate of point B on the parabola:   [   4^2 = 4x implies x = 4   ]   Therefore, point B is at (4,4).3. Determine the Slope of Line BF: The slope of the line connecting points B(4,4) and F(1,0) is calculated as follows:   [   k_{BF} = frac{4 - 0}{4 - 1} = frac{4}{3}   ]4. Equation of Line BF: With the slope k_{BF} = frac{4}{3} and passing through point F(1,0), the equation of line BF can be written as:   [   x = frac{3}{4}y + 1   ]5. Solve the System of Equations: We solve the system of equations consisting of the parabola y^{2}=4x and the line x=frac{3}{4}y+1:   [   left{begin{array}{l}   x=frac{3}{4}y+1   y^{2}=4x   end{array}right.   ]   Substituting x from the first equation into the second gives us:   [   y^{2} = 4left(frac{3}{4}y + 1right) implies y^{2} - 3y - 4 = 0   ]   Solving this quadratic equation, we find y = 4 or y = -1. Since y=4 corresponds to point B, we use y=-1 to find point C.6. Find Point C on the Parabola: Substituting y=-1 into the parabola's equation y^{2}=4x, we find:   [   (-1)^2 = 4x implies x = frac{1}{4}   ]   Therefore, point C is at left(frac{1}{4}, -1right).7. Calculate |BC|: The distance between points B(4,4) and Cleft(frac{1}{4}, -1right) is calculated using the distance formula:   [   |BC| = sqrt{left(4 - frac{1}{4}right)^2 + (4 + 1)^2} = sqrt{left(frac{15}{4}right)^2 + 5^2} = sqrt{frac{225}{16} + frac{400}{16}} = sqrt{frac{625}{16}} = frac{25}{4}   ]Therefore, the length of |BC| is boxed{frac{25}{4}}."},{"problem":"If frac{3}{5}=frac{M}{45}=frac{60}{N}, what is M+N?textbf{(A)} 27qquad textbf{(B)} 29 qquad textbf{(C)} 45 qquad textbf{(D)} 105qquad textbf{(E)} 127","solution":"Separate into two equations frac35 = frac{M}{45} and frac35 = frac{60}{N} and solve for the unknowns.

To investigate divisibility by 11, it is significant which positions the replaceable digits occupy.First case. We replace two zeros in positions of the same parity (both even or both odd). For divisibility by 11, the sum of the two new digits must be divisible by 11, and since each digit is within the range [1 ; 9], the sum must be 11. Note that divisibility by 3 is automatically satisfied (the sum of the digits of the number is 4+11=15). The following pairs of digits fit: 2--9,3--8,4--7, 5--6. Let's count the number of ways to perform the replacement. First, we choose one of these four pairs of digits (4 ways), then place the smaller digit in the position of any zero (100 ways); finally, place the larger digit in the same parity position (49 ways) - in total, this gives 4 cdot 100 cdot 49=19600 ways.Second case. We replace two zeros in positions of different parity. Then, for divisibility by 11, these digits must be the same (denote each by k), and for divisibility by 3, 4+2 k vdots 3 must hold. This condition is satisfied by k=1, k=4, and k=7. Such a replacement can be made in 3 cdot 50 cdot 50=7500 ways (choose one of the three digits, then one of fifty even positions and one of fifty odd positions).In total, we get 19600+7500=27100 ways."},{"problem":"Which of the following numbers is irrational?A: 0B: frac{π}{2}C: -frac{1}{7}D: 1.31313331","solution":"To determine which of the given numbers is irrational, we need to understand what an irrational number is.

Consider finitely many points in the plane with no three points on a line. All these points can be coloured red or green such that any triangle with vertices of the same colour contains at least one point of the other colour in its interior.What is the maximal possible number of points with this property?","solution":"## Solution. The answer is 8 .Call a set consisting of red points and green points good if no three points are collinear and any unicoloured triangle contains a point of the other colour.On the one hand, the figure on the left below shows an example of a good set with 8 points. The figure on the right shows the two types of unicololured triangles - all otherunicoloured triangles are reflections of those.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_05_5020f0da85005e646177g-07.jpg?height=442&width=1120&top_left_y=268&top_left_x=500)On the other hand, we shall prove that a good set can have at most four points of each colour. We give two proofs.First proof. For a proof by contradiction, let S be a counterexample of minimal cardinality. We may assume that S has at least five red points.Let P be any vertex of the convex hull of S. Then P cannot be in the interior of any triangle, so S backslash{P} is good. But S was a minimal counterexample, so S backslash{P} has at most four points of each colour. Therefore, S has exactly five red points, all vertices of the convex hull of S are red, and S has at most four green points.Consider the convex hull of S. It is a triangle, a quadrilateral, or a pentagon.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_05_5020f0da85005e646177g-07.jpg?height=520&width=517&top_left_y=1228&top_left_x=378)Case i: The convex hull is a triangle.Let A, B and C denote the vertices of the triangle, and let I and J be the interior red points. Without loss of generality, we may assume that the line I J intersects sides A B and A C (and not B C ), and I is nearer to A B than J is. Now A B I, A I J, A J C, B I J and B J C are five unired triangles with disjoint interiors, so at least one of them must be empty, because there are at most four green points. Thus, S is not good, in contradiction to our assumptions.Case ii: The convex hull is a quadrilateral.Let the vertices of the quadrilateral be A, B, C, D, in this cyclic order, and I be the red point in the interior. Now A B I, B C I, C D I and D A I are unired triangles with disjoint interiors, each has a green point inside: denote them by X, Y, Z, W respectively. Then X Y Z and Z W X are two unigreen triangles, but both cannot have I (the only![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_05_5020f0da85005e646177g-07.jpg?height=417&width=511&top_left_y=1753&top_left_x=1252)possible red point) in their interiors.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_05_5020f0da85005e646177g-08.jpg?height=414&width=511&top_left_y=181&top_left_x=384)Case iii: The convex hull is a pentagon.Let A, B, C, D and E denote the vertices of the pentagon, in this cyclic order. Now A B C, A C D and A D E are three unired triangles with disjoint interiors, each must have a green point in its interior, these form a unigreen triangle, which cannot have any red point inside.## Second proof.Lemma. Let a good set of coloured points be given.If the convex hull of some red points contains exactly x red points, with exactly y of them being in its interior, then there are at least x+y-2 green points in its interior. (The statement is analogous for switched colours.)Proof. If the convex hull is not a polygon (i.e. x leq 2 ), the statement is trivial. Otherwise consider a partition of the convex hull of the red points into triangles, all of which have only red points as vertices, and have no other red points in their interiors. Let N be the number of triangles of the partition. Then the sum of their angles is N pi. On the other hand, at each interior point, the sum of the angles of the triangles is always 2 pi, and at the peripherial points that form a convex (x-y)-gon, the sum is (x-y-2) pi. So the sum of the angles of the triangles in the partition isN pi=2 y pi+(x-y-2) piwhich reduces to N=x+y-2. Each of the disjoint unicoloured triangles must contain a single point in its interior, which proves the lemma.Applying the lemma on all n red points, where m red points are inside their convex hull, gives that there are at least n+m-2 green points inside the red points' convex hull. Now applying the lemma again on these green points gives that there are at least (n+m-2)-2 red points in their convex hull. But these red points are also interior points of the convex hull of all red points, therefore(n+m-2)-2 leq mThis reduces to n leq 4, and our statement is proven.Remark. The lemma can also be proven by induction on x.Remark. If we allow three colours rather than two, then any set size is possible. For details, see O. Aichholzer.

The truck takes 2 minutes longer than the car to pass through the tunnel, and since the truck's time is 1 part more than the car's, 1 part is 2 minutes. Therefore, the truck takes 10 minutes to pass through the tunnel, and the car takes 8 minutes.As shown in the figure, segment CD represents the tunnel. Let the time the truck takes from mathrm{A} to C be x minutes.

To achieve this, we first need to reach a certain number of tails.## SolutionNotice that cutting off one head is meaningless. There are three types of strikes left: with the first, the number of tails increases by 1; with the second, the number of tails decreases by 2, but the number of heads increases by 1; with the third, the number of heads decreases by 2.Each strike of the second type (and only it) changes the parity of the number of heads. Since the number of heads is initially odd, and in the end, it should become an even number (0), the number of strikes of the second type must be odd. However, one such strike is insufficient—it will not be enough to cut off all the tails, and strikes of other types only increase the number of tails. Therefore, there must be at least three strikes of the second type.With this, at least three additional heads will grow, and to cut off all the heads, at least three strikes of the third type will be required.Moreover, three strikes of the second type will cut off six tails, so at least three additional tails need to grow, which will require at least three strikes of the first type. In total, at least nine strikes are needed. And they are sufficient. For example, Ivan can first deliver three strikes of the first type (increasing the number of tails to six), then cut off all the tails with three strikes of the second type (resulting in six heads), and finally, cut off these six heads with three strikes of the third type."},{"problem":"Given that the angle between vectors overrightarrow {a} and overrightarrow {b} is frac {π}{3}, |overrightarrow {a}|=1, and |overrightarrow {b}|= frac {1}{2}, find the angle between the vector overrightarrow {a}-2 overrightarrow {b} and overrightarrow {a}.","solution":"We know that ＜ overrightarrow {a}， overrightarrow {b}＞= frac {π}{3}, |overrightarrow {a}|=1, and |overrightarrow {b}|= frac {1}{2}.Now, let's calculate the dot product ( overrightarrow {a}-2 overrightarrow {b})cdot overrightarrow {a} = overrightarrow {a}^{2}-2| overrightarrow {a}|| overrightarrow {b}|cos frac {π}{3}=1-2×1× frac {1}{2}× frac {1}{2} = frac {1}{2}.Next, we find the magnitude of the vector ( overrightarrow {a}-2 overrightarrow {b}):( overrightarrow {a}-2 overrightarrow {b})^{2}= overrightarrow {a}^{2}-4| overrightarrow {a}|| overrightarrow {b}|cos frac {π}{3}+4 overrightarrow {b}^{2} = 1-4×1× frac {1}{2}× frac {1}{2}+4× frac {1}{4}=1.Hence, | overrightarrow {a}-2 overrightarrow {b}|=1.Now, we can find the cosine of the angle between the vectors overrightarrow {a}-2 overrightarrow {b} and overrightarrow {a}:cos＜ overrightarrow {a}-2 overrightarrow {b}， overrightarrow {a}＞= frac {( overrightarrow {a}-2 overrightarrow {b})cdot overrightarrow {a}}{| overrightarrow {a}-2 overrightarrow {b}|| overrightarrow {a}|} = frac {1}{2}.Thus, the angle between the vector overrightarrow {a}-2 overrightarrow {b} and overrightarrow {a} is boxed{frac {π}{3}}."},{"problem":"4.

We also take b >= c (interchanging b and c if necessary). Dividing through by b/2 shows that there is no loss of generality in taking b = 2, so 0 = 0, so c 2 + c(2k - 2h) + h 2 - 2hk + k 2 >= 0. Hence c 2 + ck + h 2 >= (2h - k)(c + k). Hence c/h 2 + 1/(c+k) >= 2/h - k/h 2 with equality iff c = h - k. Applying this to c/(a+2) + 1/(c+1-a/2) where h = √(a+2), k = 1-a/2, we find that c/(a+2) + 2/(2c+2-a) >= 2/√(a+2) + (a-2)/(2a+4). The allowed range for c is 0 ≤ c ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ a ≤ c+2, hence 0 ≤ a ≤ 4. Put x = 1/√(a+2), so 1/√6 <= x <= 1/√2. Then 2/√(a+2) + (a-2)/(2a+4) = 2x + 1/2 - 2x 2 = 1 - (2x-1) 2 /2.

Little kids were eating candies. Each one ate 7 candies less than all the others together, but still more than one candy. How many candies were eaten in total?[5 points] (A. V. Shapovalov)","solution":"Answer: 21 candies.Solution. Let's choose one of the children, for example, Petya. If we take away 7 candies from all the others, there will be as many left as Petya has. This means that twice the number of candies Petya has equals the total number of candies minus seven. The same can be said about any of the children, which means that all the children have the same number of candies - let's say, in piles.It is clear that each one ate one whole pile less than the others together. Therefore, 7 is divisible by the size of the pile. Since each one ate more than 1 candy according to the condition, there are 7 candies in each pile, i.e., each one ate one pile less than the others together. Petya ate one pile, so the others ate two. Therefore, there are three piles in total, and 21 candies.This solution can also be written algebraically.Let S be the total number of candies eaten by the children. If one of the children ate a candies, then according to the condition, all the others ate a+7 candies, and together they ate S=a+(a+7)= =2a+7 candies. This reasoning is valid for each child, so all the children ate the same number of candies: a=(S-7)/2 each.Now let N be the number of children. Then the condition can be written as a=a(N-1)-7, from which 7=a(N-2). The number 7 is prime, so one of the factors is 1, and the other is 7. But according to the condition a>1, so a=7, N-2=1. Thus, N=3, and a total of S=aN=21 candies were eaten."},{"problem":"Example 3.
