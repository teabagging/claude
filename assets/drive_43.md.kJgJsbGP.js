What is the probability that, after two seconds, the particle is a distance of 2sqrt{2} from its original location? [i]Proposed by Connor Gordon[/i]","solution":"1. Understanding the movement: The particle starts at ((0,0,0)) and each second it moves to one of the eight lattice points a distance of (sqrt{3}) from its current location. This means it moves by (pm1) unit in each of the (x), (y), and (z) coordinates.2. Target distance: We need to find the probability that after two seconds, the particle is a distance of (2sqrt{2}) from its original location. The distance formula in three dimensions is given by:   [   d = sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}   ]   Setting (d = 2sqrt{2}), we get:   [   2sqrt{2} = sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}   ]   Squaring both sides:   [   8 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2   ]3. Possible coordinates: We need to find integer solutions ((x, y, z)) such that (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 8). The possible solutions are ((pm2, pm2, 0)) and permutations thereof. This is because:   [   2^2 + 2^2 + 0^2 = 4 + 4 + 0 = 8   ]4. Movement analysis: To reach ((pm2, pm2, 0)) or its permutations in two moves, the particle must:   - Move in the same direction twice in two coordinates.   - Move in different directions in the third coordinate.5. Counting valid paths: For a fixed first move, there are three possible second moves that satisfy the condition:   - If the first move is ((1, 1, 1)), the second move could be ((1, 1, -1)), ((1, -1, 1)), or ((-1, 1, 1)).   - Similarly, for other initial moves, there are three valid second moves.6. Total possible moves: There are (8) possible moves in the first second and (8) possible moves in the second second, giving a total of (8 times 8 = 64) possible paths.7. Probability calculation: Since for each initial move there are (3) valid second moves, and there are (8) initial moves, the total number of valid paths is (8 times 3 = 24).8. Final probability: The probability is the ratio of the number of valid paths to the total number of paths:   [   text{Probability} = frac{24}{64} = frac{3}{8}   ](blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ frac{3}{8} } )"},{"problem":"A6.

In each round, participants with the same number of points compete, but in one of the pairs, a difference of 1 point between opponents is allowed. The tournament ends as soon as a sole leader is determined. How many schoolchildren will finish the tournament with 5 points?","solution":"Answer: 56.Solution. Let f(m, k) denote the number of students who have k points after m rounds. If f(m, k) is even for any k in {0, ldots, m}, then participants with different numbers of points will not meet in the (m+1)-th round (otherwise, there would be at least two such meetings). Also, note that if athletes with n and n+1 points meet, they will end up with n and n+2 points, respectively, regardless of the outcome. We will prove two statements.1) In a tournament with 2^n participants, after m rounds, 2^{n-m} cdot C_m^k athletes will have k points, where m leq n and k in {0, ldots, m}. Let f(m, k) be the number of participants who have k points after m rounds. We will use induction on m. If m=0, then k=0, and f(0,0)=2^n. For the inductive step, assume that the required equality holds for some m < n. Then each group with the same number of points contains an even number of participants, so all participants can be paired. After the (m+1)-th round, the groups of athletes with no wins and no losses will be halved. Therefore,f(m+1,0)=frac{1}{2} f(m, 0)=frac{1}{2} cdot 2^{n-m}=2^{n-(m+1)} cdot C_{m+1}^{0} quad text{and} quad f(m+1, m+1)=frac{1}{2} f(m, m)=2^{n-(m+1)} cdot C_{m+1}^{m+1}Now, let k in {1, ldots, m}. After the (m+1)-th round, k points will be held by those who had k points and lost, as well as those who had k-1 points and won. Therefore,f(m+1, k)=frac{1}{2} cdot f(m, k)+frac{1}{2} cdot f(m, k-1)=2^{n-m-1}left(C_m^k + C_m^{k-1}right)=2^{n-(m+1)} cdot C_{m+1}^k(in the last transition, we used the main identity of Pascal's triangle). Thus, the inductive step is complete.2) In a tournament with 2^n - 2 participants and fewer than n rounds, the numbers f(2m, k) are even for any k from 0 to n, and the numbers f(2m-1, k) are odd only for k=m-1 and k=m. We will use induction on n. For n=2, everything is obvious. Assume that the statement is true for some n. Then, in a tournament with 2^{n+1} participants, after the first round, 2^n - 1 participants will have 0 points and 1 point. After the second round, 2^{n-1} participants will have 0 points and 2 points, and 2^n - 2 participants will have 1 point. For the first two groups, we use 1), and for the third group, we use the inductive hypothesis.Now, introduce fictitious participants A and B. Let them play against each other in odd rounds, with A winning; this does not affect the other participants. Additionally, let A play against some A' and lose, and B win against some B' in the (2m)-th round. Then A' must have m points, and B' must have (m-1) points. By 2), the numbers f(2m-1, m-1) and f(2m-1, m) are odd, and by 1), after adding A and B, they become even. Therefore, in the absence of A and B, participants A' and B' must play against each other; as a result, they will have m-1 and m+1 points, respectively, just as after playing against A and B. Thus, adding A and B does not affect the distribution of points among the other participants.Now, apply statement 1) for n=8. The tournament will end after 8 rounds, and C_8^5 = frac{8 cdot 7 cdot 6}{3 cdot 2 cdot 1} = 56 participants will have 5 points.

Answer: n in{1,3,5,6}.We consider two cases:(1) n is a square: n=1 is a solution, so assume n>1.

We shall prove the following inequality for n sufficiently large:d_{1}+cdots+d_{2 k}>2 k cdotlceilsqrt{n}rceilFirst, note that sqrt{n}+1 geqlceilsqrt{n}rceil, so it suffices to showd_{1}+cdots+d_{2 k}>2 k cdot(sqrt{n}+1) .For i in{1, ldots, i}, d_{i} and d_{2 k+1-i} are complementary divisors, so d_{i} cdot d_{2 k+1-i}= n.

To find the minimum value, we analyze the absolute value expressions:- The expression inside the first absolute value, 2x-2, is zero when x=1.- The expression inside the second absolute value, 2x+1, is zero when x=-frac{1}{2}.Considering the properties of absolute values, we can deduce that the minimum value occurs when the expressions inside the absolute values have opposite signs or one of them is zero, which leads to the inequality 2(x-1)(2x+1) leqslant 0. This inequality is satisfied for -frac{1}{2} leqslant x leqslant 1.Therefore, we can calculate the minimum value of f(x) as follows:f(x) = |2x-2| + |2x+1| geqslant |(2x-2) - (2x+1)| = 3Thus, the minimum value of f(x), denoted as k, is boxed{3}.# Part 2: Finding the minimum value of a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}Given that 3a+2b+c=3 and a, b, and c are all positive numbers, we aim to find the minimum value of a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}.

Note that the substitution of the variable x rightarrow x+k for any integer k does not change the range of the polynomial. Then, by making the substitution x rightarrow x-left[frac{p}{2}right] (square brackets denote the integer part), we can assume that any polynomial has one of two forms: x^{2}+q or x^{2}+x+q.The ranges of any two polynomials of different forms intersect: indeed, the values of the polynomials x^{2}+q and x^{2}+x+q^{prime} coincide at x=q-q^{prime}. Therefore, polynomials of different forms cannot be chosen.Polynomials of the first form can be chosen no more than two, since if the ranges of f_{1}(x)=x^{2}+q and f_{2}(x)=x^{2}+q^{prime} do not intersect, then q-q^{prime}=4 k+2 for some k in mathbb{Z}.

Similarly, cosleft(x - frac{pi}{2}right) can be converted to -sin x using the identity cos(theta - frac{pi}{2}) = -sin theta. Thus, the function can be rewritten as:begin{align*}f(x) & = sinleft(x + frac{pi}{2}right) + cosleft(x - frac{pi}{2}right) + m      & = cos x - sin x + m.end{align*}Now, using the identity sin(theta + phi) = sin theta cos phi + cos theta sin phi, in reverse, we can express cos x - sin x as -sqrt{2}sinleft(x - frac{pi}{4}right).

Understanding the Problem:   We need to determine the maximal number of (120^circ) angles in a 7-gon inscribed in a circle, where all sides are of different lengths.2. Initial Claim:   We claim that the maximum number of (120^circ) angles is 2.3. Setup:   Consider a cyclic heptagon (ABCDEFG). If two adjacent angles are equal, then the sides are symmetric with respect to their perpendicular bisector, contradicting our original condition of different-length sides.4. Case Analysis:   - Suppose there are 3 non-adjacent angles equal to (120^circ), say (angle B = angle D = angle F = 120^circ).   - Let (O) be the circumcenter of the circle.5. Angle Calculation:   - Since (angle B = 120^circ), the arc subtended by (angle B) is (240^circ) (since the central angle is twice the inscribed angle).   - Similarly, (angle D = 120^circ) implies the arc subtended by (angle D) is (240^circ).   - (angle F = 120^circ) implies the arc subtended by (angle F) is (240^circ).6. Contradiction:   - If (angle B = angle D = angle F = 120^circ), then the central angles (angle COA = angle COE = angle EOG = 120^circ).   - This implies that the sum of these central angles is (360^circ), which is the total angle around point (O).   - However, this configuration would force (angle GOA = 0^circ), which is impossible in a geometric figure.7. Conclusion:   - Therefore, having 3 non-adjacent (120^circ) angles leads to a contradiction.   - Hence, the maximum number of (120^circ) angles in such a 7-gon is 2.The final answer is (boxed{2})."},{"problem":"2.39.

In an ellipse, the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant and equal to the length of the major axis. In this case, the distance from D to A and B is equal to AB, so the major axis is of length AB.The eccentricity of an ellipse, e_1, is given by e_1 = frac{c}{a}, where c is the distance from the center of the ellipse to a focus, and a is the semi-major axis. In the case of the equilateral triangle, c = frac{AB}{2} and a = frac{AB}{2}, so e_1 = 1.For the hyperbola, the difference of the distances from any point on the hyperbola to the two foci is constant and equal to the length of the real axis (the distance between the vertices). Because A and B are the foci and D and E lie on the hyperbola, this difference will be less than AB (since in a hyperbola, this difference is less than the distance between foci). Therefore, the real axis of the hyperbola is less than the side length of triangle triangle ABC.The eccentricity of a hyperbola, e_2, is given by e_2 = frac{c}{a}, where now c represents the distance from the center to a focus, and a represents the semi-real axis. Because the real axis (the distance between the vertices) is less than AB and c = frac{AB}{2}, we get that e_2 > 1.Now let's examine the given options to find the incorrect one:A. e_2 + e_1 = 2 would imply that e_2 = 1 since e_1 = 1, which contradicts our deduction that e_2 > 1.B. e_2 - e_1 = 2 implies e_2 = 3, but we cannot conclude this simply based on the given conditions.

We can cancel 2R from both sides of the equation since it's a common factor and does not affect our calculation of angle A. This leaves us with: sin A(cos C + sqrt{3}sin C) = sin B + sin C.   Further, we can use the sine addition formula sin(A+C) to simplify the left-hand side: sin Acos C + sqrt{3}sin Asin C = sin(A+C) + sin C.

Since A - frac{pi}{6} lies in the interval (-frac{pi}{6}, frac{5pi}{6}), the solution to the above equation is: A - frac{pi}{6} = frac{pi}{6},   which yields the answer for angle A: A = frac{pi}{3}.   For part (2), we apply the law of cosines: a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bccos A.   Given that 3bc = 16 - a^2, we can plug this into the equation to get: 16 - 3bc = b^2 + c^2 - bc Rightarrow (b + c)^2 = 16,   which implies b + c = 4.  The area S of triangle ABC can be expressed using the formula S = frac{1}{2}bcsin A. Substituting the values we have: S_{triangle ABC} = frac{1}{2}bcsin A = frac{sqrt{3}}{4}bc leq frac{sqrt{3}}{4}(frac{b+c}{2})^2 = sqrt{3}.   This inequality holds by the AM-GM inequality, which states that the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. Equality occurs when b = c, that is b = c = 2.  Therefore, the maximum area of triangle ABC is: boxed{sqrt{3}}. "},{"problem":"3.

We will color the nodes of the grid in a checkerboard pattern, with black and white colors. The length of a closed non-self-intersecting broken line is equal to the number of nodes it passes through. Each segment of the broken line connects a black and a white node. When traversing the broken line, the colors of the nodes alternate, so the length of the closed broken line is an even number. Since there are 81 nodes in total in the grid, the length of the broken line is at most 80.

Another reasoning is possible. Let's start constructing a closed broken line starting from some node. Since we need to return to it, the number of horizontal steps to the right is the same as the number of steps to the left. Therefore, the number of horizontal steps is even.

For the equation e^{2-a} = a:Given e^{2-a} = a, we know a > 0 because the exponential function e^{x} is always positive, and thus a, being equal to e^{2-a}, must also be positive. We can rewrite the equation as:[2 - a = ln a]This simplifies to:[2 - a - ln a = 0]2. For the equation b(ln b - 1) = e^{3}:Given b(ln b - 1) = e^{3}, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides to find a relationship involving ln b. However, to simplify the process, we observe that this equation can be rearranged to find a similar form to the first equation. By dividing both sides by b and then taking the natural logarithm, we get:[ln b + ln(ln b - 1) = 3]Rearranging gives us:[2 - (ln b - 1) - ln(ln b - 1) = 0]3. Analyzing the function f(x) = 2 - x - ln x:Let's define a function f(x) = 2 - x - ln x for x > 0. We find that f(a) = 0 and f(ln b - 1) = 0. To understand the behavior of f(x), we look at its derivative:[f'(x) = -1 - frac{1}{x} = -frac{x + 1}{x}]Since x > 0, the denominator is always positive, and thus f'(x)  0. This means f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, +infty).4. Concluding that a = ln b - 1:Since f(x) is monotonically decreasing and f(a) = f(ln b - 1) = 0, it must be that a = ln b - 1. This implies:[a + 1 = ln b]5. Finding the value of ab:Given 2 - a = ln a, we can add a + 1 = ln b to both sides to get:[3 = ln a + ln b = ln(ab)]Exponentiating both sides gives us:[ab = e^{3}]Therefore, the value of ab is boxed{e^{3}}."},{"problem":"Given that sin alpha - sin beta = frac{1}{2} and cos alpha - cos beta = frac{1}{3}, find the value of cos (alpha - beta).","solution":"Since sin alpha - sin beta = frac{1}{2} and cos alpha - cos beta = frac{1}{3},we have (sin alpha - sin beta)^{2} = frac{1}{4} and (cos alpha - cos beta)^{2} = frac{1}{9},which implies that sin ^{2}alpha + sin ^{2}beta - 2sin alpha sin beta = frac{1}{4} quad quad (1) and cos ^{2}alpha + cos ^{2}beta - 2cos alpha cos beta = frac{1}{9} quad quad (2).Adding (1) and (2), we get cos (alpha - beta) = frac{59}{72}.Therefore, the answer is boxed{frac{59}{72}}.We obtain the answer by squaring both sides of the given equations and adding them together.

Finding one such pair (x, y) takes 5 seconds. Find m if  the computer needs 595 seconds to find all possible ordered pairs (x, y).","solution":"1. Understanding the problem:   We need to find pairs ((x, y) in (0, 1)) such that (a = x + my) and (b = y + mx) are both integers, where (m) is a given positive integer. Each pair takes 5 seconds to find, and the computer needs 595 seconds to find all possible pairs. We need to determine (m).2. Initial analysis:   For (m = 1), we have (a = x + y) and (b = y + x), which implies (x + y) must be an integer. Since (x, y in (0, 1)), the only possible integer value for (x + y) is 1. This gives infinitely many solutions, so (m) cannot be 1.3. Considering (m > 1):   Let (a + b = u) and (a - b = v). Then:   [   a = frac{u + v}{2}, quad b = frac{u - v}{2}   ]   Substituting (a = x + my) and (b = y + mx), we get:   [   x + my = frac{u + v}{2}, quad y + mx = frac{u - v}{2}   ]   Solving for (x) and (y):   [   x = frac{u}{2(m+1)} - frac{v}{2(m-1)}, quad y = frac{u}{2(m+1)} + frac{v}{2(m-1)}   ]4. Constraints on (x) and (y):   Since (x, y in (0, 1)), we have:   [   0 < frac{u}{2(m+1)} - frac{v}{2(m-1)} < 1, quad 0 < frac{u}{2(m+1)} + frac{v}{2(m-1)} < 1   ]   This implies:   [   0 < frac{u}{2(m+1)} < 1 + frac{v}{2(m-1)}, quad 0 < frac{u}{2(m+1)} < 1 - frac{v}{2(m-1)}   ]5. Simplifying the constraints:   For (v = 0):   [   x = y = frac{u}{2(m+1)}   ]   (u) must be even, and (u in {2, 4, 6, ldots, 2m}), giving (m) solutions.6.

Only the first case gives a positive solution a_{1}=1+sqrt{2}. Now let's try to calculate a_{2}: the equation becomesleft(a_{2}-1-sqrt{2}right)left(a_{2}+1-sqrt{2}right)=2which can be expanded toleft(a_{2}-sqrt{2}right)^{2}-1^{2}=2or a_{2}-sqrt{2}= pm sqrt{3}. Only one sign gives a positive solution a_{2}=sqrt{2}+sqrt{3}.From these first values, we hypothesize that the sequence a_{n} is given by a_{n}=sqrt{n}+sqrt{n+1} and we prove this by induction. It is true for n=0. Suppose it is true for n-1 and show it for n: the equation giving a_{n} isleft(a_{n}-sqrt{n-1}-sqrt{n}right)left(a_{n}+sqrt{n-1}-sqrt{n}right)=2which can be expanded toleft(a_{n}-sqrt{n}right)^{2}-(sqrt{n-1})^{2}=2and thusleft(a_{n}-sqrt{n}right)^{2}=n+1so a_{n}-sqrt{n}= pm sqrt{n+1}. Only the positive sign gives a positive solution, so we have a_{n}=sqrt{n}+ sqrt{n+1}, which concludes the induction.We immediately notice that the sequence (a_{n}) is increasing, and consequently, if we find an n such that a_{n-1}<2022 leqslant a_{n}, this is the n we are looking for. Indeed, if we have 0 leqslant m<n, then m leqslant n-1 and thus a_{m} leqslant a_{n-1}<2022 as required: n is indeed the smallest index such that a_{n} geqslant 2022.But now we havea_{1011^{2}-1}=sqrt{1011^{2}-1}+1011<2 cdot 1011=2022<1011+sqrt{1011^{2}+1}=a_{1011^{2}}so the mathrm{n} we are looking for is mathrm{n}=1011^{2}.Graders' Comments: The problem was well solved by the students who submitted a solution. A vast majority perfectly conjectured a_{n}=sqrt{n}+sqrt{n+1} and then proved it by induction. It is worth noting that calculating the first terms to guess an expression is a very good initiative to take in the rough draft as it can be the first step in solving a problem (as was the case here). From there, one could quickly conclude, but it was important to avoid calculation errors and to provide proper justification (arguments of increasing were relevant). These points were missing in some solutions. It is also worth noting that in tests or competitions, there is no calculator, so it is important to get used to performing efficient calculations by hand."},{"problem":"Given the function f(x)=x^{2}+ax+b (a,b in mathbb{R}) with a range of [0,+infty), if the solution set of the inequality f(x) < c is (m, m+6), then the value of the real number c is _______.","solution":"[Analysis]This problem tests understanding of the range of a quadratic function, one-variable quadratic inequalities, and the relationship between one-variable quadratic functions and equations.

Claim: The smallest positive integer ( k ) such that it is possible to mark ( k ) cells on a ( 2n times 2n ) board so that there exists a unique partition of the board into ( 1 times 2 ) and ( 2 times 1 ) dominoes, none of which contain two marked cells, is ( k = 2n ).2. Construction:    - Number the rows and columns of the ( 2n times 2n ) board from ( 1 ) to ( 2n ).   - For ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n ), mark the cells ((i, i)) and ((i, i+1)).   - This marking ensures that the cell ((i, i)) must be covered by a horizontal domino, and the cell ((i, i+1)) (except for ( i = n )) must be covered by a vertical domino.3. Uniqueness of Partition:   - By induction, the cells ((i, i)) must be covered by horizontal dominoes, and the cells ((i, i+1)) must be covered by vertical dominoes.   - This marking pattern forces a unique way to cover the entire board with ( 1 times 2 ) and ( 2 times 1 ) dominoes without any domino containing two marked cells.4. Proof of Minimality:   - Suppose ( k < 2n ). We need to show that there are at least ( 2^m ) different partitions if ( 2(n-m) + 1 ) cells are marked for some positive integer ( m ).   - Fix a main diagonal of the square. Represent cells as vertices of a multigraph where:     - Black vertices are marked cells.     - White vertices are unmarked cells.     - Red edges connect pairs of cells covered by one domino.     - Blue edges connect pairs of cells whose reflections over the diagonal are covered by one domino.   - Each vertex is incident to exactly one red and one blue edge, forming disjoint cycles with alternating colors of edges.5. Cycle Analysis:   - For ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n ), pick a cell ( a_{2i-1} ) on the diagonal that hasn't been picked before. This cell is part of a cycle ( C_i ) that crosses the diagonal at a unique cell ( a_{2i} neq a_{2i-1} ).   - By the Pigeonhole Principle, there are ( m ) cycles among ( C_i ) that contain at most one marked cell.   - In these cycles, we can swap red and blue edges, resulting in ( 2^m - 1 ) new partitions.6. Conclusion:   - If ( k < 2n ), there are multiple partitions, contradicting the requirement for a unique partition.   - Therefore, the smallest ( k ) that ensures a unique partition is ( k = 2n ).(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ k = 2n } )"},{"problem":"5.

Therefore, the volume V of the cylinder is V=pi R^2 cdot h = pi x^2(10-x).  Differentiating V with respect to x gives V'=-3pi x^2 + 20pi x.  Setting V'=0, we get x=0, or x= frac{20}{3}.

Substituting x = 1 into the derivative y' gives us the slope k of the tangent line at this point:   [   k = y'|_{x=1} = 2(1) + a = 2 + a.   ]3. Compare the slope of the tangent line to the slope of the given line: The problem states that the tangent line is parallel to the line y = 7x. The slope of the line y = 7x is 7. For two lines to be parallel, their slopes must be equal. Therefore, we set the slope of the tangent line equal to 7:   [   2 + a = 7.   ]4. Solve for a: To find the value of a, we solve the equation obtained in the previous step:   [   a = 7 - 2 = 5.   ]Thus, the value of a that makes the tangent line of the curve y=x^{2}+ax at the point (1,a+1) parallel to the line y=7x is 5.

Applying AM-GM to each term:   For each term, we can write:   [   frac{de}{a(b+1)} geq frac{2sqrt{de cdot a(b+1)}}{a(b+1)} = frac{2sqrt{dea(b+1)}}{a(b+1)}   ]   Since (abcde = 1), we have (de = frac{1}{abc}). Substituting this in, we get:   [   frac{2sqrt{frac{1}{abc} cdot a(b+1)}}{a(b+1)} = frac{2sqrt{frac{b+1}{bc}}}{a(b+1)} = frac{2sqrt{frac{b+1}{b}}}{a(b+1)} = frac{2sqrt{frac{1}{b} + 1}}{a(b+1)}   ]   This approach seems complex, so let's consider a simpler application of AM-GM directly to the sum.4. Simpler application of AM-GM:   We apply AM-GM directly to the sum of the terms:   [   frac{de}{a(b+1)} + frac{ea}{b(c+1)} + frac{ab}{c(d+1)} + frac{bc}{d(e+1)} + frac{cd}{e(a+1)}   ]   By AM-GM, we have:   [   frac{de}{a(b+1)} + frac{ea}{b(c+1)} + frac{ab}{c(d+1)} + frac{bc}{d(e+1)} + frac{cd}{e(a+1)} geq 5 sqrt[5]{frac{de}{a(b+1)} cdot frac{ea}{b(c+1)} cdot frac{ab}{c(d+1)} cdot frac{bc}{d(e+1)} cdot frac{cd}{e(a+1)}}   ]5.

Final simplification:   Since the product inside the root is 1, we have:   [   5 sqrt[5]{1} = 5 cdot 1 = 5   ]   Therefore:   [   frac{de}{a(b+1)} + frac{ea}{b(c+1)} + frac{ab}{c(d+1)} + frac{bc}{d(e+1)} + frac{cd}{e(a+1)} geq 5 cdot 1 = 5   ]   This is incorrect, as we need to show (geq frac{5}{2}). We need to re-evaluate the application of AM-GM.7. Correct application of AM-GM:   By AM-GM, we should directly apply:   [   frac{de}{a(b+1)} + frac{ea}{b(c+1)} + frac{ab}{c(d+1)} + frac{bc}{d(e+1)} + frac{cd}{e(a+1)} geq 5 sqrt[5]{frac{de}{a(b+1)} cdot frac{ea}{b(c+1)} cdot frac{ab}{c(d+1)} cdot frac{bc}{d(e+1)} cdot frac{cd}{e(a+1)}}   ]   Since the product is 1, we have:   [   5 sqrt[5]{1} = 5 cdot 1 = 5   ]   This confirms the inequality.The final answer is (boxed{frac{5}{2}})"},{"problem":"Example 1 Let O be the vertex of a parabola, F the focus, and P Q a chord passing through point F.

This indicates that for any odd number x, Q_{i}(x)(i=0,1, cdots, 6) can be divided by 2^{10}.If the integer coefficient polynomial P(x)=sum_{i=0}^{5} a_{i} x^{i} satisfies0 leqslant a_{i}5, then replace P(x) with P(x)-a_{d} x^{d-6} Q_{6}(x). Thus, through a finite number of replacements, a polynomial of degree not exceeding 5 and having the same remainder sequence as P(x) can always be obtained.Next, assume that the degree of P(x) does not exceed 5.If P(x) is reduced, then take bar{P}(x)=P(x). Otherwise, let i be the largest index of the coefficient a_{i} that does not satisfy equation (1). Let q be the quotient of b_{i} dividing a_{i}, then P(x) and P(x)-q Q_{i}(x) have the same remainder sequence, and the coefficient of the i-th term in P(x)-q Q_{i}(x) should belong to {0,1, cdots, b_{i}-1}.Repeat the above process for the remaining coefficients that do not satisfy equation (1) (starting from the highest corresponding degree), and a reduced polynomial bar{P}(x) with the same remainder sequence as P(x) can always be obtained.Now consider these 2^{37} reduced polynomials.Let a=2^{9}+1, b=1.Then P(a)-P(b)=(a-b)left(a_{1}+a_{2} A_{2}+a_{3} A_{3}+a_{4} A_{4}+a_{5} A_{5}right),where, A_{2}=a+b, A_{3}=a^{2}+a b+b^{2},A_{4}=a^{3}+a^{2} b+a b^{2}+b^{3},A_{5}=a^{4}+a^{3} b+a^{2} b^{2}+a b^{3}+b^{4}.Since a and b are both odd, A_{2} and A_{4} are even, and A_{3} and A_{5} are odd. Thus,a_{1}+a_{2} A_{2}+a_{3} A_{3}+a_{4} A_{4}+a_{5} A_{5}has the same parity as a_{1}+a_{3}+a_{5}.Therefore, if a_{1}+a_{3}+a_{5} is even, then P(a)-P(b) can be divided by 2^{10}, and the remainder sequence of P(x) is not the required permutation.For odd x, the parity of P(x) is the same as that of a_{0}+a_{1}+cdots+a_{5}, and it is odd.Exactly 2^{36} reduced polynomials satisfy that a_{1}+a_{3}+a_{5} is odd.In fact, for all reduced polynomials P(x) satisfying that a_{1} is even, P(x)+x is also a reduced polynomial, and exactly one of the two polynomials satisfies that a_{1}+a_{3}+a_{5} is odd.Exactly 2^{35} reduced polynomials satisfy that a_{1}+a_{3}+a_{5} and a_{0}+a_{1}+cdots+a_{5} are both odd.In fact, consider the reduced polynomial P(x) satisfying that a_{1}+a_{3}+a_{5} is odd and a_{0} is even, P(x)+1 is also a reduced polynomial, and exactly one of the two polynomials satisfies that a_{0}+a_{1}+cdots+a_{5} is odd.In summary, there are no more than 2^{35} different complete remainder sequences.[Note] It can be proven that there are exactly 2^{35} different remainder sequences that are permutations of 1,2, cdots, 1023."},{"problem":"The slope of the tangent line to the curve y=2x^2 at the point (1, 2) is.","solution":"Given y=2x^2,  thus, y'=4x,  therefore, the slope k of the tangent line to the curve y=2x^2 at the point (1, 2) is k=y'|_{x=1}=4times1=4.

Draw MN perpendicular to the directrix at N.  Since |MN|=|MF|,  |MA|+|MF|=|MA|+|MN|.  Since A is on the circle C: (x-4)^{2}+(y-1)^{2}=1, with center C(4,1) and radius r=1,  the minimum value of |MA|+|MF| occurs when points N, M, and C are collinear.

(Since a>0, we can multiply the inequalities by a without switching the direction of the inequalities.)Since the line with equation b=a x-4 y passes through the point (s, 4), then b=a s-4(4)and so a s=b+16 or s=frac{b+16}{a}.Since 2 leq s leq 4, then 2 leq frac{b+16}{a} leq 4 and so 2 a leq b+16 leq 4 a (again, a>0 ).Rearranging, we get 2 a-16 xrightarrow[leq]{a} b leq 4 a-16.We now proceed by determining, for each integer a with 1 leq a leq 100, the number of values of b that satisfy both 0 leq b leq 3 a and 2 a-16 leq b leq 4 a-16.To do this, we need to compare the possible lower and upper bounds in these inequalities.We note that, to satisfy both pairs of inequalities, we need both 0 leq b and 2 a-16 leq b as well as both b leq 3 a and b leq 4 a-16.Thus, we need to compare 0 with 2 a-16 and 3 a with 4 a-16.We note that 0 leq 2 a-16 is equivalent to 16 leq 2 a or 8 leq a.Therefore, when 1 leq a leq 7, to satisfy both 0 leq b and 2 a-16 leq b, it is sufficient to look at 0 leq b, and when 8 leq a leq 100, it is sufficient to look at 2 a-16 leq b.We note that 3 a leq 4 a-16 is equivalent to 16 leq a.Therefore, when 1 leq a leq 15, it is sufficient to look at b leq 4 a-16 and when 16 leq a leq 100, it is sufficient to look at b leq 3 a.Putting this all together:- When 1 leq a leq 7, it is sufficient to count the values of b that satisfy 0 leq b leq 4 a-16.When a=1,2,3,4 a-16 is negative, so there are no values of b that work.When a=4, we obtain 0 leq b leq 0, and so there is 1 value of b.When a=5, we obtain 0 leq b leq 4, and so there are 5 values of b.When a=6, we obtain 0 leq b leq 8, and so there are 9 values of b.When a=7, we obtain 0 leq b leq 12, and so there are 13 values of b.Since 1+5+9+13=28, then there are 28 pairs (a, b) in this case.- When 8 leq a leq 15, it is sufficient to count the values of b that satisfy 2 a-16 leq b leq 4 a-16.

Analyze the Inequality f(x) geq |x|Given f(x) = -x^2 + x + m + 2, we need to solve the inequality -x^2 + x + m + 2 geq |x|. Since |x| can be either x or -x depending on the value of x, we have two cases to consider:- Case 1: x geq 0In this case, |x| = x, so our inequality becomes -x^2 + x + m + 2 geq x. Simplifying, we get:-x^2 + m + 2 geq 0- Case 2: x < 0In this case, |x| = -x, so our inequality becomes -x^2 + x + m + 2 geq -x. Simplifying, we get:-x^2 + 2x + m + 2 geq 02. Solve for x in Both Cases- Case 1: -x^2 + m + 2 geq 0This is a quadratic inequality. The roots of the corresponding equation -x^2 + m + 2 = 0 are given by:x = pmsqrt{m + 2}Since we're considering x geq 0, we only take the positive root. The inequality holds for x in [0, sqrt{m + 2}].- Case 2: -x^2 + 2x + m + 2 geq 0The roots of the corresponding equation -x^2 + 2x + m + 2 = 0 are:x = 1 pm sqrt{m + 3}Since we're considering x < 0, we focus on the root x = 1 - sqrt{m + 3}. The inequality holds for x in [1 - sqrt{m + 3}, 1].3. Determine the Range of mFor the solution set of the inequality f(x) geq |x| to contain exactly one integer, the intervals derived from both cases must overlap at exactly one integer point. This condition is satisfied when the upper bound of the interval from Case 1 is just to the right of an integer, and the lower bound of the interval from Case 2 is just to the left of the same integer. This integer is 0, as it's the only point where the two cases can meet given the nature of |x|.Therefore, we need m + 2 to be slightly greater than 0^2 = 0 and m + 3 to be slightly less than 1^2 = 1.

Applying the [distance formula](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Distance_formula), we see that frac{ sqrt{a^2 + b^2} }{ sqrt{ (a-9)^2 + b^2 } } = frac{40}{41}.We want to maximize b, the height, with 9 being the base.Simplifying gives -a^2 -frac{3200}{9}a +1600 = b^2.To maximize b, we want to maximize b^2.

Finally, this means that the radius of Gamma is dfrac{360+frac{40}{9}}{2}=180+dfrac{20}{9}.Since the area is maximized when the altitude to AB is maximized, clearly we want the last vertex to be the highest point of Gamma, which just makes the altitude have length 180+dfrac{20}{9}.

By completing the square, we can rewrite ( w ) as:   [   w = -2(x^2 - 120x) + 25600 = -2(x - 120)^2 + 3200   ]   Since the coefficient of the quadratic term is negative (( -2 < 0 )), the parabola opens downwards, and the maximum value is at the vertex, which occurs at ( x = 120 ) (within the interval ( 80 leq x leq 160 )). The maximum profit is simply the value of ( w ) at this vertex:   [   boxed{w = 3200}   ]   Thus, when the selling price is set at 120 yuan, the daily sales profit is maximized, with a maximum profit of 3200 yuan.3. If we want a profit of 2400 yuan, then set ( w = 2400 ) in the equation for profit:   [   -2(x - 120)^2 + 3200 = 2400   ]   Simplify this equation to find the values of ( x ):   [   (x - 120)^2 = 400   ]   Take the square root of both sides:   [   x - 120 = pm 20   ]   This gives us two possible values for ( x ):   [   x_1 = 100 quad text{and} quad x_2 = 140   ]   Since the store wants to sell quickly, we assume that a lower price will attract more buyers. Thus, we discard ( x_2 = 140 ) as it does not align with the intention to sell faster.   The selling price should be set at:   [   boxed{x = 100}   ]"},{"problem":"In triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively.

Parallel Lines l_{1} and l_{2}For lines l_{1} and l_{2} to be parallel, their slopes must be equal. The slope of a line in the form Ax+By=C is -frac{A}{B}. Thus, for l_{1}: 4x+y=4, the slope is -frac{4}{1}=-4. For l_{2}: mx+y=0, the slope is -frac{m}{1}=-m. Setting these slopes equal gives:[ -4 = -m ][ m = 4 ] 2. Parallel Lines l_{1} and l_{3}Similarly, for lines l_{1} and l_{3} to be parallel, their slopes must be equal. For l_{3}: 2x-3my=4, the slope is -frac{2}{-3m}=frac{2}{3m}. Setting the slopes of l_{1} and l_{3} equal:[ -4 = frac{2}{3m} ][ 3m = -frac{1}{2} ][ m = -frac{1}{6} ] 3. Parallel Lines l_{2} and l_{3}For lines l_{2} and l_{3} to be parallel, their slopes must be equal. Setting the slopes equal:[ -m = frac{2}{3m} ]This equation implies that m^2 = -frac{2}{3}, which has no real solution. Thus, there is no value of m that makes l_{2} and l_{3} parallel. 4. Intersection at the Same PointFor the three lines to intersect at the same point, we consider the intersection of l_{1} and l_{2} and check if it lies on l_{3}. The intersection point (x, y) of l_{1} and l_{2} can be found by solving their equations simultaneously, yielding x = frac{4}{4-m} and y = frac{-4m}{4-m}. Substituting these into l_{3} gives:[ 2left(frac{4}{4-m}right) - 3mleft(frac{-4m}{4-m}right) - 4 = 0 ]Simplifying this equation gives:[ frac{8}{4-m} + frac{12m^2}{4-m} - 4 = 0 ][ 8 + 12m^2 - 4(4-m) = 0 ][ 12m^2 + 8 - 16 + 4m = 0 ][ 12m^2 + 4m - 8 = 0 ][ 3m^2 + m - 2 = 0 ]Solving this quadratic equation for m gives m = -1 or m = frac{2}{3}.Therefore, the values of m for which the three lines cannot form a triangle are m = 4, m = -frac{1}{6}, m = -1, and m = frac{2}{3}.

Thus, |overrightarrow{b} - overrightarrow{a}| = sqrt{6}.Let alpha be the angle between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} - overrightarrow{a}. Then,cos alpha = dfrac{overrightarrow{a} cdot (overrightarrow{b} - overrightarrow{a})}{|overrightarrow{a}| cdot |overrightarrow{b} - overrightarrow{a}|} = dfrac{-frac{3}{2}}{1 cdot sqrt{6}} = -dfrac{sqrt{6}}{4}.So, the cosine value of the angle between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} - overrightarrow{a} is boxed{-frac{sqrt{6}}{4}}."},{"problem":"【Elective 4-4: Coordinate System and Parametric Equations】In the polar coordinate system, the polar equation of curve (C_1) is (rho =dfrac{24}{4cos theta +3sin theta }).

However, in these two cases, the durations of the operations in operating rooms 1, 2, and 3 are different.Now let's prove that the duration of the operation in operating room 4 can be uniquely restored. For this, let's note that the total duration of the operations 33 and 18 minutes before the end of the operations increased by 35 minutes.

There are 116 ways to choose the first point, and 3 fewer ways to choose the second (all points are suitable except the first and the two points lying on the same horizontal or vertical line with the first).

Marks are awarded for completeness, clarity, and style of presentation. A correct solution, poorly presented, will not earn full marks.","solution":"Solution 1We consider two cases: y<60 and y geq 60.We use the facts that min (a, b) leq a, min (a, b) leq b, max (a, b) geq a, and max (a, b) geq b. In other words, the minimum of two numbers is less than or equal to both numbers and the maximum of two number is greater than or equal to both numbers.We also use the fact that if a leq b, then min (a, b)=a and max (a, b)=b. Note that the case of a=b does not affect these equations.Case 1: y<60If y<60, then min (x, y) leq y and y<60, so min (x, y)<60.Since min (x, y)<60, then LS =max (60, min (x, y))=60.Also, max (60, x) geq 60, so since y<60, then mathrm{RS}=min (max (60, x), y)=y.Therefore, in the case y<60, the equation is satisfied whenever 60=y, which is never true.Therefore, there are no ordered pairs (x, y) with y<60 that satisfy the equation.Case 2: y geq 60If x<y, then min (x, y)=x and so LS =max (60, x).If x<y, then both 60 and x are no larger than y, so the largest of 60 and x is no larger than y. In other words, max (60, x) leq y and so mathrm{RS}=min (max (60, x), y)=max (60, x).If x<y, the equation becomes max (60, x)=max (60, x) and so is true for every ordered pair (x, y).If x geq y, then min (x, y)=y and so mathrm{LS}=max (60, y)=y since y geq 60.If x geq y, then x geq 60 so max (60, x)=x and so mathrm{RS}=min (x, y)=y.If x geq y, the equation becomes y=y and so is true for every pair (x, y).Therefore, the given equation is satisfied by all pairs (x, y) with y geq 60.Since 1 leq x leq 100, there are 100 possible values for x.Since 60 leq y leq 100, there are 41 possible values for y.Therefore, there are 100 times 41=4100 ordered pairs that satisfy the equation.## Solution 2In this solution, we use the facts that if a leq b, then min (a, b)=a and max (a, b)=b.We also label as (*) the original equation max (60, min (x, y))=min (max (60, x), y).We consider the possible arrangements of the integers 60, x and y.There are six possible arrangements.

If 60 leq y leq x, then (*) is equivalent to y=y, so all (x, y) with 60 leq y leq x satisfy (*). If x leq 60 leq y, then (*) is equivalent to 60=60, so all (x, y) with x leq 60 leq y satisfy (*). If x leq y leq 60, then (*) is equivalent to 60=y, so only (x, y) with y=60 and x leq 60 satisfy(*). These (x, y) are already accounted for in the third case.If y leq 60 leq x, then (*) is equivalent to 60=y, so only (x, y) with y=60 and x geq 60 satisfy (*). These (x, y) are included in the second case.If y leq x leq 60, then (*) is equivalent to 60=y, so only y=60 and 60 leq x leq 60, which implies x=60. In this case, only the pair (60,60) satisfies (*) and this pair is already included in the first case.Therefore, we need to count the pairs of positive integers (x, y) with x leq 100 and y leq 100 which satisfy one of 60 leq x leq y or 60 leq y leq x or x leq 60 leq y.From these three ranges for x and y we see that y geq 60 in all cases and x can either be less than or equal to 60 or can be greater than or equal to 60 and either larger or smaller than y.In other words, these three ranges are equivalent to the condition that y geq 60.Therefore, (*) is satisfied by all pairs (x, y) with y geq 60.Since 1 leq x leq 100, there are 100 possible values for x.Since 60 leq y leq 100, there are 41 possible values for y.Therefore, there are 100 times 41=4100 ordered pairs that satisfy the equation.ANSWER: 4100## Part B"},{"problem":"Among three cards labeled 0, 1, and 2, two cards are drawn randomly.

Hence, ( f(1) = 1 ).   - Inductive Step:     - Assume ( f(k) = k ) for all ( k leq n ).     - We need to show that ( f(n+1) = n+1 ).     - Suppose ( f(n+1) neq n+1 ). Then ( f(n+1) ) must be some ( k leq n ) (since ( f ) maps to ( mathbb{N} )).     - If ( f(n+1) = k leq n ), then by the injectivity of ( f ) (since ( f ) is a function from ( mathbb{N} ) to ( mathbb{N} )), we would have ( f(n+1) = f(k) ), which implies ( n+1 = k leq n ), a contradiction.     - Therefore, ( f(n+1) geq n+1 ).     - Similarly, for ( f(f(n+1)) ):       - If ( f(f(n+1)) leq n ), then ( f(f(n+1)) = f(k) ) for some ( k leq n ), leading to ( f(n+1) = k leq n ), a contradiction.       - Hence, ( f(f(n+1)) geq n+1 ).     - For ( f(f(f(n+1))) ):       - If ( f(f(f(n+1))) leq n ), then ( f(f(f(n+1))) = f(k) ) for some ( k leq n ), leading to ( f(f(n+1)) = k leq n ), and thus ( f(n+1) = k leq n ), a contradiction.       - Hence, ( f(f(f(n+1))) geq n+1 ).     - Since ( 3f(f(f(n+1))) + 2f(f(n+1)) + f(n+1) = 6(n+1) ), we need ( f(n+1) = n+1 ) to satisfy the equation.By induction, we have shown that ( f(n) = n ) for all ( n in mathbb{N} ).(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ f(n) = n } )."},{"problem":"If the point P (cosalpha, sinalpha) is on the line y = -2x, then sin 2alpha + 2cos 2alpha = quad.","solution":"Given the line y = -2x, we substitute the coordinates of the point P into this equation:sinalpha = -2cosalpha.Now, let's square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:(sinalpha)^2 = (-2cosalpha)^2,sin^2alpha = 4cos^2alpha.Adding cos^2alpha to both sides:sin^2alpha + cos^2alpha = 4cos^2alpha + cos^2alpha,Since sin^2alpha + cos^2alpha = 1, we have:1 = 5cos^2alpha.Dividing both sides by 5:frac{1}{5} = cos^2alpha,Taking the square root of both sides (and considering cosalpha is negative as it lies on the line y=-2x and x must be negative for y to be positive):cosalpha = -sqrt{frac{1}{5}}.sinalpha = -2cosalpha = 2sqrt{frac{1}{5}}.We can now compute sin 2alpha + 2cos 2alpha using the double-angle formulas sin 2alpha = 2sinalphacosalpha and cos 2alpha = cos^2alpha - sin^2alpha:sin 2alpha + 2cos 2alpha = 2sinalphacosalpha + 2(cos^2alpha - sin^2alpha),= 2(2sqrt{frac{1}{5}})left(-sqrt{frac{1}{5}}right) + 2left(left(-sqrt{frac{1}{5}}right)^2 - (2sqrt{frac{1}{5}})^2right),= -4left(frac{1}{5}right) + 2left(frac{1}{5} - frac{4}{5}right),= -frac{4}{5} + 2left(-frac{3}{5}right),= -frac{4}{5} -frac{6}{5},= -frac{10}{5},= -2.Hence, the result is sin 2alpha + 2cos 2alpha = boxed{-2}."},{"problem":"17 cdot 76 Given a right triangle ABC, with the two legs BC=3, AC=4, find the length of the shorter angle bisector that trisects the right angle.(A) frac{32 sqrt{3}-24}{13}.(B) frac{12 sqrt{3}}{13}-9.(C) 6 sqrt{3}-8.(D) frac{5 sqrt{10}}{6}.(E) frac{25}{12}.(11th American High School Mathematics Examination, 1960)","solution":"[Solution] Let CD be the trisector of angle C, and draw DE perp AC at E.

Determine the minimum number of distinct complex roots of the polynomial prod_{k=1}^m, (f+k) , when f covers the set of n^{text{th}} - degree polynomials with complex coefficients.[/color]","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to determine the minimum number of distinct complex roots of the polynomial (prod_{k=1}^m (f+k)), where (f) is an (n^{text{th}})-degree polynomial with complex coefficients.2. Analyzing the Polynomials:   Consider the polynomials (f+k) for (k = 1, 2, ldots, m). Each (f+k) is an (n^{text{th}})-degree polynomial. Therefore, each (f+k) has exactly (n) roots (counting multiplicities).3. Distinct Roots:   Observe that no two polynomials (f+i) and (f+j) (for (i neq j)) can have a common root. This is because if (r) were a common root, then (f(r) + i = 0) and (f(r) + j = 0), which implies (i = j), a contradiction.4. Counting Roots:   Since each (f+k) has (n) roots and there are (m) such polynomials, the total number of roots (counting multiplicities) is (nm).5. Repeated Roots:   If there are repeated roots, they must be repeated within a single polynomial (f+k). Let (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_t) be the repeated roots of (prod_{k=1}^m (f+k)), where (x_j) has multiplicity (a_j).6. Derivative Condition:   The (k^{text{th}}) order root of (f+k) is the ((k-1)^{text{th}}) order root of (f'). Since (deg(f') = n-1), we have:   [   (a_1 - 1) + (a_2 - 1) + cdots + (a_t - 1) leq n - 1   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_t leq n - 1 + t   ]7. Minimum Number of Distinct Roots:   The number of distinct roots of (prod_{k=1}^m (f+k)) is:   [   nm - (a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_t) + t   ]   Using the inequality (a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_t leq n - 1 + t), we get:   [   nm - (n - 1 + t) + t = nm - n + 1   ]   Therefore, the minimum number of distinct roots is:   [   n(m-1) + 1   ]8. Equality Case:   Equality occurs when (f(x) = (x-1)^n - 1), which ensures that the roots are distributed in such a way that the minimum number of distinct roots is achieved.The final answer is (boxed{n(m-1) + 1})"},{"problem":"1.

Counting Words Containing the Substring \\"AMC\\":   We use complementary counting to find the number of words that do not contain the substring \\"AMC\\". First, we count the number of words that do contain the substring \\"AMC\\".   - Placement of \\"AMC\\":     The substring \\"AMC\\" can appear in the six-letter word in the following positions:     - Starting at position 1: AMCxxx     - Starting at position 2: xAMCxx     - Starting at position 3: xxAMCx     - Starting at position 4: xxxAMC     Thus, there are 4 possible positions for the substring \\"AMC\\".   - Remaining Letters:     After placing \\"AMC\\" in one of the positions, we have 3 remaining positions to fill with any of the letters A, M, or C. The number of ways to fill these 3 positions is:     [     3^3 = 27     ]   - Total Count of Words Containing \\"AMC\\":     Therefore, the total number of six-letter words containing the substring \\"AMC\\" is:     [     4 cdot 27 = 108     ]3. Subtracting Overcounted Cases:   We need to subtract the cases where \\"AMC\\" appears more than once, as they have been counted multiple times. Specifically, the word \\"AMCAMC\\" has been counted twice in the above calculation.   - Count of \\"AMCAMC\\":     There is exactly 1 such word: \\"AMCAMC\\".   - Adjusting the Count:     Therefore, we subtract 1 from our previous count:     [     108 - 1 = 107     ]4. Complementary Counting:   Finally, we subtract the number of words containing \\"AMC\\" from the total number of six-letter words to find the number of words that do not contain the substring \\"AMC\\":   [   729 - 107 = 622   ]Conclusion:[boxed{622}]"},{"problem":"9.1.

If q=2, then 2^{p}=1+2 has no solution. If q=3, then 2^{p}=2+6 gives p=3 as the only solution. If q=5, then 2^{p}=8+120 gives p=7 as the only solution. Henceforth, we may assume that q is at least 7.Now we notice that we can rewrite the condition asq!=2^{p}-2^{q-2}=2^{q-2}left(2^{p-q+2}-1right)Since q! is positive, the right-hand side is also positive. In particular, 2^{p-q+2}>1, so p-q+2>0 and 2^{p-q+2} is an integer (and greater than 1). We conclude that 2^{p-q+2}-1 is an integer and odd. Therefore, the right-hand side has exactly q-2 factors of 2. To count the number of factors on the left-hand side, let nu_{2}(a) be the function that counts how many factors an integer a has. Since q is a prime number greater than 2, it is odd. Then leftlfloorfrac{q}{2}rightrfloor=frac{q-1}{2} and in general leftlfloorfrac{q}{2^{i}}rightrfloor=leftlfloorfrac{q-1}{2^{i}}rightrfloor.

Due to the condition, equality must also hold, so q=2^{n}+1 for some natural number n.Now that we have come a long way by looking at factors of 2, we would like to derive a contradiction from equation (2) using modular arithmetic since q! has many prime factors. From our small examples, we know that this will not work modulo 3 or 5, so we try the next prime number: 7.Since we have assumed that q is at least 7, q! is indeed divisible by 7. This means that 2^{p-q+2} equiv 1 bmod 7. Since also 2^{3} equiv 8 equiv 1 bmod 7, this means that 2^{operatorname{ggd}(p-q+2,3)} equiv 1 bmod 7. But 2^{1} not equiv 1 bmod 7, so operatorname{ggd}(p-q+2,3)=3 or p-q+2 equiv 0 bmod 3. We know, however, that q=2^{n}+1 is congruent to -1 or 0 modulo 3. Since we also know that q is prime (and greater than 3), the second case is ruled out and we conclude that q equiv-1 bmod 3. But then the previous gives p equiv q-2 equiv-1-2 equiv 0 bmod 3. Since p is also prime, we conclude that p=3. But 2^{q-2}+q!=2^{3}=8 has no solutions for q geq 7.We conclude that the only pairs (p, q) that satisfy are (3,3) and (7,5).Remark. In general, if an arbitrary natural number q in binary notation has r digits 1, thennu_{2}(q!)=sum_{i=1}^{infty}leftlfloorfrac{q}{2^{i}}rightrfloor=q-rSo for 2^{n}<q<2^{n+1}, it holds due to r geq 2 that nu_{2}(q!) leq q-2 with equality if and only if r=2.

Since both x and -frac{2}{x} are increasing functions on this interval, their sum, f(x), is also increasing. Therefore, we can find the range of f(x) by evaluating it at the endpoints of the interval:- At x=1, f(1) = 1 - frac{2}{1} = -1.- At x=2, f(2) = 2 - frac{2}{2} = 1.Thus, the range of f(x) on [1,2] is [-1,1].Step 2: Analyzing g(x)Given g(x) = -x^2 + ax - 5, we need to find its minimum value on the interval [2,4] for different values of a.

We need to find the sum of the first two integers ( n > 1 ) such that ( 3^n ) is divisible by ( n ) and ( 3^n - 1 ) is divisible by ( n - 1 ).2. First, let's analyze the condition ( 3^n ) is divisible by ( n ). This implies that ( n ) must be a divisor of ( 3^n ). Since ( 3^n ) is a power of 3, ( n ) must be a power of 3 to satisfy this condition. Therefore, ( n = 3^k ) for some integer ( k geq 1 ).3. Next, we need to check the second condition: ( 3^n - 1 ) is divisible by ( n - 1 ). Substituting ( n = 3^k ), we need to check if ( 3^{3^k} - 1 ) is divisible by ( 3^k - 1 ).4. Let's start with ( k = 1 ):   - ( n = 3^1 = 3 )   - Check the first condition: ( 3^3 = 27 ) is divisible by ( 3 ), so the first condition is satisfied.   - Check the second condition: ( 3^3 - 1 = 27 - 1 = 26 ) is divisible by ( 3 - 1 = 2 ), so the second condition is satisfied.   - Therefore, ( n = 3 ) is a valid solution.5. Next, let's try ( k = 2 ):   - ( n = 3^2 = 9 )   - Check the first condition: ( 3^9 = 19683 ) is divisible by ( 9 ), so the first condition is satisfied.   - Check the second condition: ( 3^9 - 1 = 19683 - 1 = 19682 )     - We need to check if ( 19682 ) is divisible by ( 9 - 1 = 8 ).     - By the difference of cubes, ( 3^9 - 1 = (3^3 - 1)(3^6 + 3^3 + 1) = 26 times 757 ).     - Since ( 26 ) is not divisible by ( 8 ), the second condition is not satisfied.   - Therefore, ( n = 9 ) is not a valid solution.6. Next, let's try ( k = 3 ):   - ( n = 3^3 = 27 )   - Check the first condition: ( 3^{27} ) is divisible by ( 27 ), so the first condition is satisfied.   - Check the second condition: ( 3^{27} - 1 )     - We need to check if ( 3^{27} - 1 ) is divisible by ( 27 - 1 = 26 ).     - By the difference of cubes, ( 3^{27} - 1 = (3^9 - 1)(3^{18} + 3^9 + 1) ).     - We already know that ( 3^9 - 1 = 26 times 757 ), and ( 26 ) is divisible by ( 26 ).     - Therefore, ( 3^{27} - 1 ) is divisible by ( 26 ), so the second condition is satisfied.   - Therefore, ( n = 27 ) is a valid solution.7.

Identifying the Axis of Symmetry:The axis of symmetry for the new parabola is given by setting the inside of the square to zero:[x - n + 2 = 0 implies x = n - 2]4. Analyzing Points A and B:Given that points A(2, y_1) and B(4, y_2) lie on the new parabola and y_1 > y_2, it implies that point A is closer to the vertex of the parabola than point B. Since the parabola opens upwards, the vertex must be to the left of the midpoint of A and B.5. Finding the Value of n:The midpoint of A and B is at x = frac{2 + 4}{2} = 3. Since the vertex (and thus the axis of symmetry) must be to the left of this midpoint for y_1 to be greater than y_2, we have:[n - 2 > 3]Solving for n gives:[n > 5]6.

Formulate the problem in graph theory terms:   The problem can be formulated as finding a maximal subset of the edge set ( E(K_6) ) of the complete graph ( K_6 ) that covers all vertices and contains no 1-factor (perfect matching). A 1-factor is a set of edges such that each vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the set.5. Upper bound on the size of ( S ):   To see that ( |S| leq 10 ), consider an 1-factorization of ( K_6 ). An 1-factorization of ( K_6 ) is a partition of the edge set ( E(K_6) ) into 1-factors. Since ( K_6 ) has 15 edges and each 1-factor has 3 edges, there are 5 1-factors in ( K_6 ). Since ( S ) can contain at most 2 edges from each 1-factor (to avoid forming a 1-factor), we have:   [   |S| leq 5 times 2 = 10   ]6. Prove that ( |S| = 10 ) is not possible:   If ( |S| = 10 ), then ( S ) would consist of all the edges of a ( K_5 ) (a complete graph on 5 vertices). However, a ( K_5 ) does not cover all 6 vertices of ( K_6 ), so ( S ) cannot have 10 elements and still cover all six digits.7. Conclusion:   The largest possible size of ( S ) is 9, as demonstrated by the example subset ( S ) given above.The final answer is ( boxed{9} )."},{"problem":"[ Remarkable property of a trapezoid ] [ Transferring sides, diagonals, etc. ]In quadrilateral A B C D, diagonals A C and B D intersect at point K.

Find the radius of this circle if A B=3, A C=sqrt{13}, and L K: K M=1: 3.","solution":"Prove that A D | B C. Denote B C=x, express the sides of the trapezoid A B C D in terms of x, and use the cosine theorem to form an equation in terms of x.## SolutionWe will prove that B C | A D. Suppose this is not the case, and draw a line through point B parallel to A D(figure 1). It is known that the intersection point of the diagonals and the midpoints of the bases of any trapezoid lie on the same line. Therefore, the line M K intersects the segment B P at its midpoint L_{1}. Then the segment L L_{1} is the midline of triangle C B P. Thus, L L_{1} | A C and L M | A C, but by the condition, L M and A C intersect at point K. A contradiction is obtained. Therefore, the quadrilateral A B C D is a trapezoid with bases B C and A D.From the similarity of triangles B L K and D M K (figure 2), it follows that B L: D M=K L: K M=1: 3, and since points L and M are the midpoints of the bases B C and A D, then B C: A D=1: 3.Let B C=x. Then A D=3 x. Since a circle can be inscribed in the quadrilateral A B C D, the sums of its opposite sides are equal, i.e., B C+A D=A B+C D. Therefore, C D=B C+A D-A B=x+3 x-3=4 x-3. Draw a line through vertex C parallel to side A B. Let this line intersect the base A D at point Q. From the cosine theorem for triangles A D C and Q D C, we getbegin{gathered}cos angle A D C=frac{D A^{2}+D C^{2}-A C^{2}}{2 cdot D A cdot D C}=frac{9 x^{2}+(4 x-3)^{2}-13}{2 cdot 3 x(4 x-3)}, text { and } cos angle A D C=frac{D Q^{2}+D C^{2}-Q C^{2}}{2 cdot D Q cdot D C}=frac{4 x^{2}+(4 x-3)^{2}-9}{2 cdot 2 x(4 x-3)}end{gathered}From the equationfrac{9 x^{2}+(4 x-3)^{2}-13}{2 cdot 3 x(4 x-3)}=frac{4 x^{2}+(4 x-3)^{2}-9}{2 cdot 2 x(4 x-3)}we find that x=2 or x=frac{2}{5}, but for x=frac{2}{5}, we get 4 x-3<0. Therefore, B C=x=2, Q D=2 x=4, C D= 4 x-3=5Since Q C^{2}+Q D^{2}=9+16=25=D C^{2}, triangle C Q D is a right triangle, so C Q=3 is the height of the trapezoid.

Since frac{25}{z(x + 4z)} = frac{d}{x} is an integer, we conclude that 25 is divisible by z(x + 4z). Since x + 4z > z.1) z = 1, x + 4z = 5. Then x = 1, d = frac{25x}{z(x + 4z)} = 5. Therefore, k = dx = 5, a = dy = 4dz = 20, from which n = 25.2) z = 1, x + 4z = 25. Then x = 21, d = frac{25x}{z(x + 4z)} = 21. Therefore, k = dx = 21^2 = 441, a = dy = 4dz = 84, from which n = 525.Now let a be an odd number (and n, accordingly, even). Then substituting a = n - k into the obtained equation, we get 100k = n(n - k). Let d = operatorname{GCD}(n, k), then k = dx and n = dy, where x and y are coprime. We get the equation 100dx = dy(dy - dx), which simplifies to 100x = dy(y - x) after canceling d. Since x, y, and y - x are coprime, and dy(y - x) is divisible by x, we conclude that d is divisible by x.Furthermore, from the oddness of k and a, it follows that the numbers d, x, and y - x are also odd. Since dy(y - x) is divisible by 4, y is divisible by 4, i.e., y = 4z.We get 100x = 4dz(4z - x), from which 25x = dz(4z - x). Since frac{25}{z(4z - x)} = frac{d}{x} is an integer, we conclude that 25 is divisible by z(4z - x). Thus, the numbers z and 4z - x give a product of 1, 5, or 25 and are coprime. Therefore, one of them is 1, and the other is a divisor of 25.1) z = 1, 4z - x = 1. Then x = 3, d = frac{25x}{z(4z - x)} = 75. Therefore, k = dx = 225, n = dy = 4dz = 300.2) z = 1, 4z - x = 5 or 4z - x = 25 - these cases are impossible because 4z - x > 4z = 4.3) z = 5, 4z - x = 1. Then x = 19, d = frac{25x}{z(4z - x)} = 95. Therefore, k = dx = 19 cdot 95 = 1805, n = dy = 4dz = 1900.4) z = 25, 4z - x = 1. Then x = 99, d = frac{25x}{z(4z - x)} = 99. Therefore, k = dx = 99^2 = 9801, n = dy = 4dz = 9900.## 8th grade, 2nd variant"},{"problem":"1.

Expanding, we have 1 + cot alpha = 2left[frac {cot alpha + 1}{cot alpha - 1}right] Longrightarrow (cot alpha - 3)(cot alpha + 1) = 0.

What is the value of m ?(A) 21(B) 69(C) 115(D) 35(E) 105","solution":"The property of an integer being either even or odd is called its parity.If two integers are both even or they are both odd, then we say that the two integers have the same parity.If one integer is even and a second integer is odd, then we say that the two integers have different parity.The result of adding two integers that have the same parity is an even integer.The result of adding two integers that have different parity is an odd integer.The parity of each term of an FT sequence (after the second term) is determined by the parity of the first two terms in the sequence.For example, if each of the first two terms of an FT sequence is odd, then the third term is even (since odd plus odd is even), the fourth term is odd (since odd plus even is odd), the fifth term is odd (since even plus odd is odd), and so on.There are 4 possibilities for the parities of the first two terms of an FT sequence.The sequence could begin odd, odd, or even, even, or odd, even, or even, odd.In the table below, we write the parity of the first few terms of the FT sequences that begin in each of the 4 possible ways.| Term Number | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 || :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || Parity # 1 | odd | odd | even | odd | odd | even | odd | odd | even | odd || Parity # 2 | even | even | even | even | even | even | even | even | even | even || Parity # 3 | odd | even | odd | odd | even | odd | odd | even | odd | odd || Parity # 4 | even | odd | odd | even | odd | odd | even | odd | odd | even |The FT sequence beginning odd, odd (Parity #1) continues to repeat odd, odd, even. Since the parity of each term is dependent on the parity of the two terms preceding it, this odd, odd, even pattern will continue throughout the entire sequence.That is, in each successive group of three terms beginning at the first term, one out of three terms will be even and two out of three terms will be odd.The odd, odd, even pattern ends at term numbers that are multiples of 3 (the even-valued terms are terms 3,6,9,12, and so on).Since 2019 is a multiple of 3(2019=3 times 673), frac{1}{3} of the first 2019 terms will be even-valued and frac{2}{3} will be odd-valued, and so there are twice as many odd-valued terms as there are even-valued terms in the first 2019 terms.The 2020^{text {th }} term is odd (since the pattern begins with an odd-valued term), and so there are more than twice as many odd-valued terms as there are even-valued terms in every FT sequence that begins odd, odd.This is exactly the required condition for the FT sequences that we are interested in.How many FT sequences begin with two odd-valued terms, each of which is a positive integer less than 2 m ?There are 2 m-1 positive integers less than 2 m (these are 1,2,3,4, ldots, 2 m-1 ).Since m is a positive integer, 2 m is always an even integer and so 2 m-1 is always odd.Thus, the list of integers from 1 to 2 m-1 begins and ends with an odd integer, and so the list contains m odd integers and m-1 even integers.The first term in the sequence is odd-valued and so there are m choices for it.Similarly, the second term in the sequence is also odd-valued and so there are also m choices for it.Thus, there are a total of m times m or m^{2} FT sequences that begin with two odd-valued terms.Do any of the other 3 types of FT seqences satisfy the required condition that there are more than twice as many odd-valued terms as there are even-valued terms?Clearly the FT sequence beginning even, even (Parity #2) does not satisfy the required condition since every term in the sequence is even-valued.The FT sequence beginning odd, even (Parity #3) continues to repeat odd, even, odd.That is, in each successive group of three terms beginning at the first term, one out of three terms will be even and two out of three terms will be odd.As we saw previously, 2019 is a multiple of 3 and so frac{1}{3} of the first 2019 terms are even-valued and frac{2}{3} are odd-valued.Thus there are twice as many odd-valued terms as there are even-valued terms in the first 2019 terms.The 2020^{text {th }} term is odd (since the pattern begins with an odd-valued term), and so there are more than twice as many odd-valued terms as there are even-valued terms in every FT sequence that begins odd, even.How many FT sequences begin with an odd-valued first term and an even-valued second term, each being a positive integer less than 2 m ?As we showed previously, the list of integers from 1 to 2 m-1 begins and ends with an oddvalued integer, and so the list contains m odd-valued integers and m-1 even-valued integers. The first term in the sequence is odd-valued and so there are m choices for it.The second term in the sequence is even-valued and so there are m-1 choices for it.Thus, there are a total of m times(m-1) FT sequences that begin with an odd-valued term followed by an even-valued term.Finally, we consider the FT sequences that begin with an even-valued term followed by an odd-valued term (Parity #4).Again, there are exactly twice as many odd-valued terms as there are even-valued terms in the first 2019 terms (since the pattern repeats even, odd, odd).However in this case, the 2020^{t h} term is even and so there are fewer than twice as many oddvalued terms as there are even-valued terms.Thus, there are m^{2}+m times(m-1) FT sequences that satisfy the required conditions.Since there are 2415 such FT sequences, we may solve m^{2}+m times(m-1)=2415 by trial and error.Evaluating m^{2}+m times(m-1) when m=30, we get 30^{2}+30 times 29=1770, and so m is greater than 30 .When m=33, we get 33^{2}+33 times 32=2145.When m=34, we get 34^{2}+34 times 33=2278.When m=35, we get 35^{2}+35 times 34=2415, as required.ANSWER: (D)"},{"problem":"8.46 Two players, A and B, take turns placing chess pieces \\"Bishops\\" on the squares of a chessboard: A starts and places a white bishop each time, while B places a black bishop each time.

We will show that these two digits must appear in the same number. Indeed, if 9 appears with the digit (a) and 0 with the digit (b), then the product of these two numbers would be smaller if we were to swap the 0 and the (a):[(10 cdot 9 + a)(10 cdot b + 0) = 900b + 10ab < 900b + 10 cdot a cdot 9 = (10 cdot 9 + 0)(10b + a)]since (b < 9). Thus, one of the two-digit numbers must certainly be 90.Similarly, the next largest and smallest digits, 8 and 1, must also appear in the same number, because if they were to appear with the digits (c) and (d) respectively, then swapping the 1 and (c) would again increase the product:[(10 cdot 8 + c)(10 cdot d + 1) = 810d + 80 + c + 10(c - 1)d < 810d + 80 + c + 10(c - 1) cdot 8 = (10 cdot 8 + 1)(10 cdot d + c)]Similarly, we find that the digits 7 and 2, 6 and 3, and 5 and 4 must appear in the same numbers.

Note that 3(ab + bc + ca) leq a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) = (a + b + c)^2 = n^2, so the 4 columns have at most frac{4n^2}{3} different-colored pairs. That is, S leq frac{4n^2}{3}. On the other hand, any 3 rows have a column with 3 different colors, which form 3 different-colored pairs, thus there are 3 binom{n}{3} different-colored pairs. However, the same different-colored pair may appear in n-2 different 3-row groups, so S geq 3 cdot frac{binom{n}{3}}{n-2}. Therefore, 3 cdot frac{binom{n}{3}}{n-2} leq S leq frac{4n^2}{3}. However, this inequality always holds, and does not provide a range for n. Readers can consider whether this estimate can be improved. From another perspective, consider the negation of \\"any three rows have a column with 3 cells of different colors\\": there exist three rows such that all columns of these three rows have only two colors. We use proof by contradiction to find the columns with only two colors. Through trial, we find that n < 10. Otherwise, take any 10 rows to form a 10 times 4 grid M. Consider the first column of M, there must be a color that appears at most 3 times. Thus, at least 7 rows have only two colors in the first column. Consider the second column of these 7 rows, there must be a color that appears at most 2 times. Thus, at least 5 rows have only two colors in the first and second columns. Consider the third column of these 5 rows, there must be a color that appears at most 1 time. Thus, at least 4 rows have only two colors in the first, second, and third columns. Consider the last column of these 4 rows, there must be a color that appears at most 1 time, thus at least 3 rows have only two colors in all columns. Let these 3 rows be A_1, A_2, and A_3, then any column of A_1, A_2, and A_3 has two cells of the same color, which is a contradiction. When n = 9, the answers chosen by 9 people for each question are (1,2,1,2), (2,3,2,2), (3,1,3,2), (1,1,2,1), (2,2,3,1), (3,3,1,1), (1,3,3,3), (2,1,1,3), (3,2,2,3), so n = 9 is possible, hence the maximum value of n is 9."},{"problem":"In the fraction below and its decimal notation (with period of length  4) every letter represents a digit, and different letters denote different digits.

For f(x) = e^{x} - e^{-x}, we have f(-x) = e^{-x} - e^{x} = -(e^{x} - e^{-x}) = -f(x), so f(x) is an odd function.

The overall function is said to be monotonically decreasing on mathbb{R}. This implies that the value of f(x) at x = 1 from the left must be greater than or equal to the value from the right. This gives us f(1) = 1^2 - 2a + a + 2 = 3 - a geq 1^{2a-6}. Since 1^{2a-6} = 1 for any a, we get 3 - a geq 1, which simplifies to a leq 2.Combining these conditions gives us a system of inequalities:- a geq 1 (Condition 1)- 2a - 6 < 0 implies a < 3 (Condition 2, but note that the requirement for a leq 2 from the third condition is stricter)- a leq 2 (Condition 3)Solving this system of inequalities, we find that the common range where all conditions are satisfied is 1 leq a leq 2.Therefore, the range of a is boxed{[1,2]}."},{"problem":"Given two vectors overrightarrow{a} = (1 + log_{2}x, log_{2}x) and overrightarrow{b} = (log_{2}x, 1),(1) Find the value of the real number x if overrightarrow{a} perp overrightarrow{b};(2) Find the range of the function f(x) = overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b}, where x in [frac{1}{4}, 2].","solution":"(1) Given overrightarrow{a} = (1 + log_{2}x, log_{2}x) and overrightarrow{b} = (log_{2}x, 1),if overrightarrow{a} perp overrightarrow{b}, then (1 + log_{2}x) cdot log_{2}x + log_{2}x = 0,which leads to log_{2}x = 0 or log_{2}x = -2,thus, we find x = 1 or x = frac{1}{4}.(2) The function f(x) = overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = (1 + log_{2}x) cdot log_{2}x + log_{2}x= (log_{2}x)^2 + 2log_{2}x,Let t = log_{2}x, then x in [frac{1}{4}, 2] gives us t in [-2, 1],so we have the function y = t^2 + 2t = (t + 1)^2 - 1,when t = -1, the function reaches its minimum value (-1),when t = 1, the function reaches its maximum value (3).Therefore, the range of the function f(x) is boxed{[-1, 3]}."},{"problem":"4.

Initial Setup:   - The Black Queens are initially placed at positions ((1,1), (2,1), (3,1), ldots, (8,1)).   - The White Queens are initially placed at positions ((1,8), (2,8), (3,8), ldots, (8,8)).2. Movement Constraints:   - Queens can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally by any number of squares as long as no other Queens are in the way.   - Black and White Queens move alternately.3. Strategy for Minimal Moves:   - We need to move each Black Queen to the corresponding position of a White Queen and vice versa.   - We will consider moving the Queens in pairs to minimize the number of moves.4. Detailed Steps:   - Consider the rightmost two columns first:     - Move the White Queen at ((8,8)) to ((4,5)).     - Move the White Queen at ((7,8)) to ((4,4)).     - Move the Black Queen at ((8,1)) to ((8,8)).     - Move the Black Queen at ((7,1)) to ((7,8)).     - Move the White Queen at ((4,5)) to ((8,1)).     - Move the White Queen at ((4,4)) to ((7,1)).   - Repeat the above steps for the next pair of columns:     - Move the White Queen at ((6,8)) to ((3,5)).     - Move the White Queen at ((5,8)) to ((3,4)).     - Move the Black Queen at ((6,1)) to ((6,8)).     - Move the Black Queen at ((5,1)) to ((5,8)).     - Move the White Queen at ((3,5)) to ((6,1)).     - Move the White Queen at ((3,4)) to ((5,1)).   - Repeat the above steps for the next pair of columns:     - Move the White Queen at ((4,8)) to ((2,5)).     - Move the White Queen at ((3,8)) to ((2,4)).     - Move the Black Queen at ((4,1)) to ((4,8)).     - Move the Black Queen at ((3,1)) to ((3,8)).     - Move the White Queen at ((2,5)) to ((4,1)).     - Move the White Queen at ((2,4)) to ((3,1)).   - Repeat the above steps for the last pair of columns:     - Move the White Queen at ((2,8)) to ((1,5)).     - Move the White Queen at ((1,8)) to ((1,4)).     - Move the Black Queen at ((2,1)) to ((2,8)).     - Move the Black Queen at ((1,1)) to ((1,8)).     - Move the White Queen at ((1,5)) to ((2,1)).     - Move the White Queen at ((1,4)) to ((1,1)).5. Counting the Moves:   - Each pair of columns requires 6 moves.   - There are 4 pairs of columns.   - Total moves required: (4 times 6 = 24).Therefore, the minimal number of moves required to interchange the Black and White Queens is (24).The final answer is (boxed{24})."},{"problem":"18.

Subtracting these two equations, we have:[a_{n+1}a_{n+2} - a_{n}a_{n+1} = lambda (S_{n+1} - S_{n}) - 0]Since S_{n+1} - S_{n} = a_{n+1}, the equation simplifies to:[a_{n+1}(a_{n+2} - a_{n}) = lambda a_{n+1}]Given that a_{n+1} neq 0, we can divide both sides by a_{n+1}, yielding:[a_{n+2} - a_{n} = lambda]Thus, we have proved that a_{n+2} - a_{n} = lambda.Part (Ⅱ)Given that {a_{n}} is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference d, we start with the given conditions. From a_{1}a_{2}=lambda a_{1}-1 and a_{1}=1, we find a_{2}=lambda -1. Also, since a_{n+2}-a_{n}=lambda, we have a_{3}-a_{1}=lambda, which implies a_{3}=1+lambda. Considering the arithmetic sequence properties, we have:[1 + lambda - (lambda - 1) = 2 Rightarrow lambda = 4]Thus, the common difference d is found from 2d = a_{3} - a_{1} = 4, leading to d = 2. Therefore, the general term of the sequence is a_{n} = 1 + 2(n-1) = 2n - 1.Let b_{n} = frac{a_{n}}{3^{n}}, then b_{n} = (2n - 1) cdot left(frac{1}{3}right)^{n}. The sum T_{n} is given by:[T_{n} = sum_{k=1}^{n} (2k - 1) cdot left(frac{1}{3}right)^{k}]Subtracting frac{1}{3}T_{n} from T_{n}, we get:[frac{2}{3}T_{n} = frac{1}{3} + 2 sum_{k=1}^{n} left(frac{1}{3}right)^{k} - (2n - 1) cdot left(frac{1}{3}right)^{n+1}]This simplifies to:[frac{2}{3}T_{n} = frac{1}{3} + 2 cdot frac{left(frac{2}{3}right)^{2}left[1-left(frac{1}{3}right)^{n-1}right]}{1-frac{1}{3}} - (2n - 1) cdot left(frac{1}{3}right)^{n+1}]Further simplification gives:[frac{2}{3}T_{n} = frac{2}{3} - left(frac{1}{3}right)^{n}(2n)]Therefore, we find that:[T_{n} = 1 - 3n cdot left(frac{1}{3}right)^{n} lt 1]Hence, we have proved that T_{n} < 1, and the final answer is boxed{T_{n} < 1}."},{"problem":"Xiao Hong bought a pair of sneakers, the original price was 260 yuan, and now the store is selling them at a 30% discount.

Find the value of m.","solution":"Since the distance from the focus to the directrix of the parabola C: y=ax^{2}(a > 0) is dfrac{1}{4},  we have dfrac{1}{2a}= dfrac{1}{4}. Solving this equation gives a=2.  Therefore, the equation of the parabola C is y=2x^{2}(a > 0).  Since two points A(x_{1},y_{1}), B(x_{2},y_{2}) on C are symmetric about the line y=x+m,  we can assume the equation of line AB is y=-x+t.  By solving the system begin{cases} y=-x+t  y=2x^{2} end{cases} and eliminating y, we get 2x^{2}+x-t=0,  Since line AB intersects the parabola at two distinct points, we have Delta =1+4t > 0.  According to the relationship between roots and coefficients, we have x_{1}+x_{2}=-dfrac{1}{2} and x_{1}x_{2}=-dfrac{t}{2}. Given x_{1}x_{2}=-dfrac{1}{2}, we find t=1.  Thus, the equation of line AB is y=-x+1.  Let the midpoint of segment AB be M(x_{M},y_{M}), then x_{M}=dfrac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}=-dfrac{1}{4},  therefore y_{M}=-(-dfrac{1}{4})+1=dfrac{5}{4}.  Substituting M(-dfrac{1}{4}, dfrac{5}{4}) into the line y=x+m gives dfrac{5}{4}=-dfrac{1}{4}+m, solving this yields m=dfrac{3}{2}.  Hence, the answer is boxed{dfrac{3}{2}}.  Starting from the definition of p for the parabola, we can determine a. By assuming the equation of line AB based on the symmetry of points A(x_{1},y_{1}), B(x_{2},y_{2}) about the line y=x+m, and solving it together with the equation of the parabola, we can find the equation of line AB.

It is straightforward to check that the pairs (1,1),(3,1), and (5,4) are winning pairs. Now suppose that a is a positive integer not equal to 1, 3, and 5. We will show that there are no winning pairs (a, n) by distinguishing three cases. Case 1: a is even. In this case we have a=2^{alpha} d for some positive integer alpha and some odd d. Since a geq 2^{alpha}, for each positive integer n there exists an i in{0,1, ldots, a-1} such that n+i=2^{alpha-1} e, where e is some odd integer.

For each positive integer n, there exists an i in{0,1, ldots, a-5} such that n+i=2 d for some odd d. We get  t(n+i)=d not equiv d+2=t(n+i+4) quad(bmod 4) and  t(n+a+i)=n+a+i equiv n+a+i+4=t(n+a+i+4) quad(bmod 4) Therefore, the integers t(n+a+i)-t(n+i) and t(n+a+i+4)-t(n+i+4) cannot be both divisible by 4, and therefore there are no winning pairs in this case. Case 3: a=7. For each positive integer n, there exists an i in{0,1, ldots, 6} such that n+i is either of the form 8 k+3 or of the form 8 k+6, where k is a nonnegative integer.

But k k k k=k times 1111 and the remainder of the division of 1111 by 3 is 1, so the remainder of the division of k by 3 is 2. Since 1 leq k leq 9, we can only have k equal to 2, 5, or 8. As in Solution 1, the cases k=2 and k=8 are impossible, and k=5 is the only option, in which case n=43 and the three numbers sought are 41, 43, and 45, which constitute the only solution to the problem.Solution 2: Since k k k k=3 n^{2}+8, we obtain3 n^{2}=k k k k-8=(k k k times 10+k)-(9-1)=(k k k times 10-9)+(k+1)But k k k times 10-9=k k(k-1) 1 is a multiple of 3, so k+1 is also a multiple of 3.

Similarly, if k=8, we getn^{2}=frac{8888-8}{3}=2960=2^{4} times 5 times 37which, again, is impossible, since this last number is not a perfect square. Therefore, the only remaining option is k=5.

Initial Setup and Strategy:   - We need to cover a 2008 times 2008 chessboard with the smallest number of rectangles such that every cell is contained within at least one rectangle.   - We start by drawing the perimeter of the chessboard as one rectangle.   - Then, we fill in the remaining cells by covering two rows or columns at a time.2. Optimality Argument:   - Suppose we have x rectangles that cover the chessboard.   - Define a rectangle as covering a row if one of its horizontal sides is contained in that row. Similarly, define covering columns.   - Each rectangle can cover at most 4 rows/columns (2 rows and 2 columns).3. Unique Rows/Columns:   - Let y be the number of rows/columns that are covered only once by any rectangle. Call these rows/columns unique.   - Claim: For each rectangle, at most two of the rows/columns it covers can be unique.   - Proof: If a rectangle covers three unique rows/columns, it must be the perimeter of the chessboard, which is not possible for internal rows/columns to be unique. Hence, at most two unique rows/columns per rectangle.4. Bounding the Number of Rectangles:   - From the claim, there are at least frac{y}{2} rectangles for which a row/column is unique.   - Each of these rectangles can cover rows/columns not on the perimeter, leading to the inequality:     [     4(x - y) + 2y ge 4 cdot 2007 - y     ]   - Simplifying, we get:     [     4x - 2y ge 4 cdot 2007 - y implies 4x ge 4 cdot 2007 + y implies x ge 2007 + frac{y}{4}     ]5. Improving the Bound:   - If x = 2007, then y = 0, meaning no row/column is unique, which is not possible.   - Therefore, x ge 2008.   - To eliminate the case x = 2008, we improve the bound on the RHS to 4 cdot 2007 - y + 4 because the perimeter must also be covered:     [     4x - 4y + 2y ge 4 cdot 2008 - y implies 4x ge 4 cdot 2008 + y implies x ge 2008 + frac{y}{4}     ]   - Hence, x = 2008 implies y = 0, which is not possible.6.

Suppose that a satisfies the condition of the problem. From the first equality, express x=a-frac{1}{y}=frac{a y-1}{y} and substitute it into the third: z=a-frac{1}{x}=a-frac{y}{a y-1}=frac{a^{2} y-y-a}{a y-1}.

Due to the symmetry of the relations in the condition, the remaining variables x and z also satisfy this equation. All of this together gives three different roots of the quadratic equation y^{2}-a y+1=0, which is impossible.

The requirement that x, y, z are distinct is equivalent to y not being a root of the quadratic equation y^{2}-a y+1=0.

However, the total number of pots of both types of flowers replaced next year should not exceed 80 pots. How should the planting quantities of these two types of flowers be arranged to minimize the planting cost for this year? What is the minimum cost?","solution":" Solution:# Part 1: Cost per Pot for Type A and B FlowersLet's denote the cost per pot for type A flowers as x yuan and for type B flowers as y yuan. From the given information, we can set up the following system of equations:1. For 3 pots of type A and 4 pots of type B, the cost is 330 yuan: 3x + 4y = 330.2. For 4 pots of type A and 3 pots of type B, the cost is 300 yuan: 4x + 3y = 300.Solving this system of equations, we proceed as follows:- Multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 3 to eliminate y:  - 12x + 16y = 1320  - 12x + 9y = 900- Subtract the second equation from the first to solve for y:  - 16y - 9y = 1320 - 900  - 7y = 420  - y = 60- Substitute y = 60 into the first original equation to solve for x:  - 3x + 4(60) = 330  - 3x + 240 = 330  - 3x = 90  - x = 30Therefore, the cost per pot for type A flowers is 30 yuan and for type B flowers is 60 yuan. So, we have boxed{x = 30, y = 60}.# Part 2: Minimizing Planting Cost with ConstraintsLet m represent the number of pots of type A flowers to be planted, and thus (400 - m) will be the number of pots of type B flowers. The total cost of planting, denoted as w, can be expressed as:- The inequality for the total number of pots replaced next year not exceeding 80 pots is given by:  - (1-70%)m + (1-90%)(400-m) leq 80  - Simplifying, we get 0.3m + 0.1(400-m) leq 80  - 0.3m + 40 - 0.1m leq 80  - 0.2m leq 40  - m leq 200- The total cost w is calculated as:  - w = 30m + 60(400-m)  - Simplifying, w = 30m + 24000 - 60m  - w = -30m + 24000Since the coefficient of m in the cost equation is negative, the cost w decreases as m increases. To minimize the cost, we set m to its maximum allowable value, which is m = 200.Substituting m = 200 into the cost equation:- w = -30 times 200 + 24000 = 18000 yuan.Therefore, to minimize the planting cost for this year, 200 pots of type A flowers and 200 pots of type B flowers should be planted, resulting in a minimum cost of boxed{18000 text{ yuan}}."},{"problem":"If p, q, frac{2 p-1}{q}, frac{2 q-1}{p} are all integers, and p>1, q>1, find the value of p+q.","solution":"Solution 1 First, p neq q.Indeed, if p=q, then[frac{2 p-1}{q}=frac{2 p-1}{p}=2-frac{1}{p} quad text{, since } p>1, quad frac{2 p-1}{q} text{ is not an integer, contradicting the problem statement.}]By symmetry, assume without loss of generality that p>q, and let frac{2 q-1}{p}=m, then m is a positive integer.[because quad m p=2 q-1, quad therefore quad q=3.]Thus, p=2 q-1=5.[therefore quad p+q=8 text{.}]Solution 2 From Solution 1, we know p neq q, assume without loss of generality that p>q,Let frac{2 p-1}{q}=m,[frac{2 q-1}{p}=n text{.}]Then m, n are positive integers, and it is easy to see that m>n.From (2), q=frac{n p+1}{2},Substituting (3) into (1), we get[begin{array}{l}2 p-1=m q=m cdot frac{n p+1}{2} . therefore quad(4-m n) p=m+2,end{array}][therefore quad 4-m n text{ is a positive integer.}]That is, m n=1, m n=2 or m n=3.Noting that m>n, we have only[left{begin{array}{l}m=2 n=1end{array} text { or } left{begin{array}{l}m=3 n=1 .end{array}right.right.]When m=2, n=1, from (1) and (2) we get p=2, q=frac{3}{2}, which does not meet the problem's conditions.When m=3, n=1, from (1) and (2) we get[begin{array}{c}quad p=5, q=3 . therefore quad p+q=8 .end{array}]"},{"problem":"1.

These two earthquakes in a short period of time have drawn people's attention to earthquake disasters and methods of disaster prevention. When an earthquake occurs, a large amount of energy is released, which is the main cause of earthquake disasters. Studies have shown that there is a linear relationship between the common logarithm of the energy released E (unit: joules) and the magnitude M of the earthquake. If the energy released by a magnitude 4 earthquake is 6.3 times 10^{10} joules and the energy released by a magnitude 6 earthquake is 6.3 times 10^{13} joules, then the energy released by the earthquake in Pingyuan County is approximately left(  right) (Reference data: lg 6.3approx 0.8, 10^{0.05}approx 1.1).A: 8 times 10^{11} joulesB: 1.1 times 10^{11} joulesC: 8 times 10^{12} joulesD: 1.1 times 10^{13} joules","solution":"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given linear relationship between the common logarithm of the energy released E (in joules) and the magnitude M of the earthquake, which can be represented as lg E = lambda M + mu.

For a magnitude 6 earthquake, the energy released is 6.3 times 10^{13} joules.Using these points, we can set up the following system of equations:1. lg(6.3 times 10^{10}) = 4lambda + mu2. lg(6.3 times 10^{13}) = 6lambda + muGiven that lg 6.3 approx 0.8, we can rewrite the equations as:1. 10 + 0.8 = 4lambda + mu2. 13 + 0.8 = 6lambda + muSolving this system of equations, we find:- Subtracting the first equation from the second gives 3 = 2lambda Rightarrow lambda = 1.5.- Substituting lambda = 1.5 into the first equation gives 10.8 = 6 + mu Rightarrow mu = 4.8.Therefore, we have lambda = 1.5 and mu = 4.8, so the equation relating the magnitude of an earthquake to the energy released is lg E = 1.5M + 4.8.For the earthquake in Pingyuan County with a magnitude of 5.5, we can calculate the energy released as follows:[lg E = 1.5 times 5.5 + 4.8 = 13.05]Therefore, E = 10^{13.05}.

Understanding the Fibonacci Representation:   - The Fibonacci representation of a positive integer ( k ) is given by:     [     k = sum_{i=2}^n a_i F_i,     ]     where ( a_i in {0, 1} ) for all ( i ), ( a_n = 1 ), and ( F_i ) denotes the ( i^{text{th}} ) Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as ( F_0 = 0 ), ( F_1 = 1 ), and ( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} ) for all ( i ge 2 ).2. Minimal Fibonacci Representation:   - A minimal Fibonacci representation of ( k ) is one that has the fewest number of 1's. According to Zeckendorf's theorem, every positive integer can be uniquely represented as a sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers.3. Constructing the Minimal Representation:   - To find the smallest positive integer with exactly eight 1's in its minimal Fibonacci representation, we need to select eight non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers starting from ( F_2 ).4. Choosing the Fibonacci Numbers:   - The smallest non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers starting from ( F_2 ) are ( F_2, F_4, F_6, ldots, F_{16} ). This sequence ensures that no two selected Fibonacci numbers are consecutive.5. Summing the Selected Fibonacci Numbers:   - The selected Fibonacci numbers are:     [     F_2, F_4, F_6, F_8, F_{10}, F_{12}, F_{14}, F_{16}.     ]   - Using the property of Fibonacci numbers, we know that:     [     F_{2k} = F_{2k-1} + F_{2k-2}.     ]   - Therefore, the sum of these Fibonacci numbers can be expressed as:     [     F_2 + F_4 + F_6 + F_8 + F_{10} + F_{12} + F_{14} + F_{16}.     ]6. Simplifying the Sum:   - Notice that the sum of these Fibonacci numbers is equivalent to:     [     F_{17} - 1,     ]     because the sum of the first ( n ) Fibonacci numbers is ( F_{n+2} - 1 ).7. Calculating ( F_{17} ):   - The Fibonacci sequence up to ( F_{17} ) is:     [     F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, F_2 = 1, F_3 = 2, F_4 = 3, F_5 = 5, F_6 = 8, F_7 = 13, F_8 = 21, F_9 = 34, F_{10} = 55, F_{11} = 89, F_{12} = 144, F_{13} = 233, F_{14} = 377, F_{15} = 610, F_{16} = 987, F_{17} = 1597.     ]   - Therefore:     [     F_{17} - 1 = 1597 - 1 = 1596.     ]Conclusion:[boxed{1596}]"},{"problem":"In an equilateral triangle, mark every point whose distance from the nearest vertex is less than the distance from the centroid.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to place positive integers on an infinite chessboard such that:   - No two numbers are equal.   - For any number ( m ) placed on a square ( C ), at least ( k ) of the squares orthogonally adjacent to ( C ) have a multiple of ( m ) written on them.2. Analyzing the Constraints:   - If ( k = 4 ), then all four orthogonally adjacent squares must have multiples of ( m ). This is impossible because two adjacent squares cannot both divide each other. Hence, ( k neq 4 ).   - If ( k = 3 ), consider a square with a number ( a ). Suppose the number ( ka ) is written next to it. Without loss of generality, let the number not divisible by ( a ) be to its left. Below ( ka ), there must be a multiple of it, say ( akb ). The square to the left of this must be a multiple of both ( a ) and ( akb ), which is not possible since it cannot divide both.3. Constructing a Solution for ( k = 2 ):   - We need to show that it is possible to place numbers such that each number ( m ) has at least 2 orthogonally adjacent squares with multiples of ( m ).   - Start by placing the numbers ( 1, 2, 4, 8 ) in a ( 2 times 2 ) square:     [     begin{array}{|c|c|}     hline     1 & 2      hline     4 & 8      hline     end{array}     ]   - We can extend this pattern by adding new rows or columns while maintaining the condition. For example, add a new column to the right:     [     begin{array}{|c|c|c|}     hline     1 & 2 & 16      hline     4 & 8 & 32      hline     end{array}     ]     Here, ( 16 ) is a multiple of ( 2 ) and ( 8 ), and ( 32 ) is a multiple of ( 4 ) and ( 8 ).4. Generalizing the Construction:   - For any new row or column, pick the top right square and add a multiple of it to its right. Below it, take a multiple of the product of numbers on the left and top (choose multiples large enough to ensure distinctness).   - This ensures that each number has at least 2 orthogonally adjacent squares with multiples of it.The final answer is ( boxed{ k = 2 } )."},{"problem":"We define the ridiculous numbers recursively as follows:[list=a][*]1 is a ridiculous number.[*]If a is a ridiculous number, then sqrt{a} and 1+sqrt{a} are also ridiculous numbers.

This is because any point on this line can be described as having coordinates where the y value is one more than the x value, due to the equation of the line. For the circle to pass through A(1,0) and B(-1,-2), we equate the distance from C to A and from C to B because both points lie on the circle, and the distance from the center to any point on the circle is the radius, which is constant. Therefore, we get:(t-1)^{2}+(t+1-1)^{2}=(t+1)^{2}+(t+1+2)^{2}Simplifying this, we get:(t-1)^2 + (t)^2 = (t+1)^2 + (t+3)^2Solving this equation, we find that t=-1.

How many elements can S contain at most?","solution":"III. (50 points)Lemma: Any a+b consecutive integers can be arranged in a circle such that the difference between any two adjacent numbers is a or b.Proof for a_{0}=0: Let s=a+b-1. Construct the sequence a_{0}, a_{1}, cdots, a_{s, 1}, such that a_{k+1}=left{begin{array}{l}a_{k}-bleft(text { when } a_{k} geqslant bright)  a_{k}+aleft(text { when } a_{k}<bright)end{array}right..Assume there exists u, v such that a_{u}=a_{v} and u < v. Then b v - a u = a_{u} - a_{s} + 1. If u > b, then a_{u} - a_{u-b} = b, which contradicts u > b. Thus, u leqslant b. Then b v = a u - a_{s} + 1 leqslant a b, so v leqslant a.Therefore, u leqslant b, v leqslant a.Thus, a+b=s+1=u+v leqslant a+b, so u=b, v=a, which gives a_{1+1}=0.Thus, the numbers 0,1,2, cdots, s can be arranged in a circle as a_{0}, a_{1}, cdots, a_{s}, such that the difference between any two adjacent numbers is a or b. Therefore, any a+b consecutive integers can be arranged in a circle such that the difference between any two adjacent numbers is a or b. The lemma is proved.Now, let's solve the original problem:Let m=frac{n}{a+b}. We will prove that the number of elements in S cannot exceed mleft[frac{a+b}{2}right].Divide {1,2, cdots, n} into the following m subsets: {1,2, cdots, a+b},{a+b+1, cdots, 2 a+2 b}, cdots, {(m-1) a+(m-1) b+1, cdots, m a+m b}Each subset contains a+b consecutive integers. By the lemma, they can be arranged in a circle such that the difference between any two adjacent numbers is a or b. Therefore, the numbers in each subset that belong to S cannot be adjacent. Thus, at most left[frac{a+b}{2}right] numbers in each subset can belong to S. Therefore, S can have at most mleft[frac{a+b}{2}right] elements.Now, we will prove that this maximum value can be achieved. Assume a > b, and let d=left[frac{a+b}{2}right]. We construct the following sequence:begin{array}{l}1+a_{0}, 1+a_{2}, cdots, 1+a_{2 d-2}, cdots,(a+b)+1+a_{0},(a+b)+1+a_{2}, cdots, (a+b)+1+a_{2 d-2}, cdots,(m-1)(a+b)+1+a_{0},(m-1)(a+b)+1+a_{2}, cdots,(m-1)(a+b)+1+a_{2 d-2} .end{array}Now, we will prove that this sequence satisfies the conditions:Starting from the beginning of the sequence, every d consecutive numbers form one segment.In each segment, the difference between any two numbers is the difference between any two of a_{0}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{2 d-2}.It is easy to see that the differences between any two of a_{0}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{2 d-2} are not a or b.This is because any difference between two of them can be expressed as a x - b y, where x+y=2,4, cdots, 2 d-2. If a x - b y = a, then a(x-1) = b. By (a, b)=1, we get x=1, y=0, so x+y=1, which is a contradiction! If a x - b y = b, then a x = b(y+1). By (a, b)=1, we get x=b, y=a-1, so x+y=a+b-1 geqslant 2 d-1 > 2 d-2, which is a contradiction!The difference between any two numbers in adjacent segments is also not a or b. (The difference between any two numbers in adjacent segments can be expressed as a+b+a_{1}-a_{i}. If a+b+a_{1}-a_{i}=a or b, then a_{s}-a_{t}=a or b, which is impossible.)Finally, the difference between any two numbers in non-adjacent segments is definitely greater than a+b, and thus cannot be a or b.In summary, there are no two numbers in the above sequence whose difference is a or b.Therefore, the final answer is frac{n}{a+b} cdotleft[frac{a+b}{2}right].Note: This is a generalization of problem 13 from the 7th American Mathematical Invitational.

Thus, this does not guarantee m perp beta.2. alpha cap gamma = m, alpha perp beta, gamma perp beta:   Given gamma perp beta and alpha perp beta, we can conclude that gamma and alpha are parallel to each other because they are both perpendicular to the same plane (beta). Since m lies in plane gamma (alpha cap gamma = m), it will also be perpendicular to plane beta.

Reformulate the condition:   The condition can be rephrased as finding integers ( m ) and ( n ) in the same class such that ( m < n leq 2m ). If such integers exist, we can set ( a = 2m - n ) and ( x = y = n - m ). Conversely, if no such integers exist, then elements of each class form an increasing sequence ( e_1 < e_2 < ldots < e_k ) with ( e_{i+1} > 2e_i ) for every ( i ). This implies that in any triple of elements from the same class, the largest one is greater than the sum of the other two, and thus there is no triple ( a + x, a + y, a + x + y ) in the same class.3. Determine ( h(r) ):   We need to show that ( h(r) = 2r ).4. Prove ( h(r) = 2r ):   - Upper Bound:     Consider the set ({1, 2, ldots, 2r}). If this set is partitioned into ( r ) classes, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two elements from the set ({r, r+1, ldots, 2r}) (which has size ( r+1 )) must be in the same class. Let these elements be ( m ) and ( n ) with ( m < n ). Since ( n leq 2r ) and ( m geq r ), we have ( m < n leq 2m ). Thus, the condition is satisfied.   - Lower Bound:     We need to show that ({1, 2, ldots, 2r-1}) can be partitioned into ( r ) classes such that there are no ( m, n ) with ( m < n leq 2m ) in any class.

Also, draw the heights S H_{a}, S H_{b}, S H_{c}, S H_{d} to the edges D A, A B, B C, C D respectively. Since S H_{a} perp D A and (by the theorem of three perpendiculars) H H_{a} perp D A, we have angle S H_{a} H=alpha. From the right triangle S H_{a} H, we get S H_{a}=S H / sin (alpha).Similarly, we find that the heights S H_{b}, S H_{c}, and S H_{d} also have the same value. Denote their length as h_{1}=h / sin (alpha). Using the areas of the lateral faces, we get D A=27 x, A B=9 x, B C=9 x, C D=27 x, where x=2 / h_{1}.Since triangles B A D and B C D are equal by three sides, the quadrilateral A B C D is a kite (symmetric with respect to the diagonal B D). In the inscribed quadrilateral A B C D, the angles D A B and D C B are equal and supplement each other to 180^{circ}, so they are each 90^{circ}. The area of the right triangle D A B is thus frac{1}{2} cdot 27 x cdot 9 x=frac{1}{2} 243 x^{2}; the area of the entire base is twice this, and equals 243 x^{2}. According to the problem, it is equal to 36, from which we find x=sqrt{36 / 243}=2 /(3 sqrt{3}), so h_{1}=2 / x=3 sqrt{3}.Now we find alpha. For this, consider how the areas of the lateral faces change when projected onto A B C D. The heights of the lateral faces, drawn from the vertex S, are multiplied by cos (alpha), while the corresponding bases of the triangles remain unchanged; thus, the areas are multiplied by cos (alpha). On the other hand, the union of the projections of the lateral faces is exactly the quadrilateral A B C D, from which we get 36=(9+9+27+27) cdot cos (alpha). Therefore, cos (alpha)=frac{1}{2}, so alpha=pi / 3.Finally, we find h=h_{1} sin (alpha)=4.5 and the volume of the pyramid frac{1}{3} cdot S_{A B C D} cdot h=frac{1}{3} cdot 36 cdot 4.5=54."},{"problem":"34.

According to the definition of an ellipse,  the trajectory of point (M) is an ellipse with (A) and (C) as its foci, and (2a=10), (c=1),Therefore, (b= sqrt{24} ),  thus, the equation of the ellipse is ( dfrac{x^{2}}{25}+ dfrac{y^{2}}{24}=1 ).Therefore, the correct choice is boxed{text{D}}."},{"problem":"23.

Since m+n=190, we see that k is a factor of 190=2 times 5 times 19 with k neq 190. We consider six cases:(i) k=2. Then a+b=95, and there are 94 such pairs (a, b) of a and b such that the equation holds.(ii) k=5. Then a+b=38, and there are 37 such pairs ( a, b) of a and b such that the equation holds.(iii) k=19. Then a+b=10, and there are 9 such pairs (a, b) of a and b such that the equation holds.(iv) k=10. Then a+b=19, and there are 18 such pairs ( a, b ) of a and b such that the equation holds.(v) k=38. Then a+b=5, and there are 4 such pairs (a, b) of a and b such that the equation holds.(vi) k=95. Then a+b=2, and there is 1 such pair (a, b) of a and b such that the equation holds.It follows from the above cases that the number of ordered pairs (m, n) of positive integers m and n such that m+n=190 and m and n are not relatively prime is 94+37+9-18-4-1=117.Since the total number of ordered pairs (m, n) such that m+n=190 is 189 , we conclude that the required number of ordered pairs (m, n) where m and n are relatively prime is 189 -117=72."},{"problem":"Eyes are the windows of the soul.
