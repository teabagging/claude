I often do sense inside my head, i.e., pricking with pins and needles and flu-like symptoms all the time. The reasons for the above-mentioned problems are due to unprotected sex with a creature (dog). Under the heavy influence of an alcohol, such a blunder was committed. I have an apprehension of contracting rabies from that encounter. Can rabies be sexually transmitted? Please suggest me what test should I need to do to rule out the above-mentioned symptoms. I have great hope in you as you are one of experienced and best doctor cum pathologist. Please advice me the test so that I can perform the test and revert it to you for treatment.","Doctor":"Hello. Rabies can spread sexually but your symptoms do not classically point towards rabies infection. The neurological symptoms like confusion, nausea, excess salivation, etc., are missing. So the chance of rabies is less as per my opinion. However, for rabies, testing multiple samples like saliva, spinal CSF fluid, etc., like examination are needed. You can rule out leptospirosis by serological ELISA testing as you have a history of sex with the dog. There are many zoonotic diseases which mean those infections which spread from animal to human. HIV also can be ruled out by ELISA testing. So your detailed evaluation is needed to do further work up. For primary work-up, you can investigate as follows. Blood pressure measurement, serum all vitamin B estimation, SGPT, SGOT, urea, creatinine estimation, ESR, full CBC, serum ionized calcium estimation, serum vitamin (OH) D estimation.

Air humidifiers are of various types and not all of them are useful for someone suffering from tonsillitis. And also, tonsillitis requires gargling of warm water mixed with salt. Salt water gargling helps reduce pain, inflammation and infection in the throat by the following ways. Use Vaporizer or Medicated Inhalant When we suffer from rhinitis/ sinusitis/ pharyngitis, and when we perform steam inhalation it soothes the inflammed areas and gives comfort. It helps in healing and cure from the disease. A vaporizer (steam humidifier, warm mist humidifier) heats or boils water, releasing steam and moisture into the air. A medicated inhalant can also be added to the vapor to help reduce coughs. Vaporizers are more healthy than cool mist humidifiers because steam is less likely to convey mineral impurities or microorganisms from the standing water. Steam is more healthy than cool mist when one suffers from above mentioned conditions.

You can choose a sunscreen lotion between 40-50 spf and with uv protection. Take some amount of sunscreen lotion in your palms and apply it gently over your face and other parts which get exposed in sunlight. Do it regularly and even if there are clouds then also use sunscreen lotion. If you work for longer shifts then repeat the application of suncreen lotion once again in the afternoon. Along with this always cover your head with a hat to avoid direct exposure to ssunlight Drink one glass of water before going outside as it will help in less water loss. Drink plenty of water whole day to avoid water loss from the body. Avoid cold drinks and caffeinated drinks and prefer fresh lemon drink and fruits having high water content like watermelon, etc. After coming home, wash your face with herbal face wash and then use aloe vera gel over face. Take some sandalwood powder and add a pinch of turmeric powder in it and some rose water in it and make a paste. Apply this over face for 10 minutes and then wash it away with simple water. You can use it two to three times a week. It will help you a lot.

They are always found in infants and they are at their maximum size at the age of 5 years, after that, they start regressing in size up to 8 years if the nasopharynx is free from infection. On the other hand, if an individual is having recurrent respiratory tract infections in childhood, the adenoids will grow up to a large size."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 24-year-male.

When I urinate and come back, after a while, I can feel some urine passes my urinary tract, and I have to urinate again. Can you prescribe some tablets?","Doctor":"Hello. We call this as urinary incontinence in medical language. There are so many possibilities which can be responsible for this. Most probably your urinary bladder may fail to empty properly due to weakness of bladder muscle. For this condition, you have to get a USG (ultrasonography) done, where I want the detail about post-void residual volume. It means an ultrasonologist will take scan one before urinating and another after passing the urine in which he will mention the volume of post-void residual urine (PVU). If the volume retention is moderate, then we have to strengthen your pelvic floor muscle with some exercise and believe me it gives an excellent result and I had, treated so many patients with that exercise. Another possibility is decreased blood concentration of ADH (anti-diuretic hormones) which is, responsible for concentrating the urine and lack of this hormone is responsible for frequent urination. The last but not least, I would advise to get your blood sugar level done (both- fasting and two hours after a meal). As you know, without knowing the cause, nobody can prescribe you the medicine as it can be dangerous for you. So I will suggest you to follow my advice, get these two tests done, and send it back to me for proper evaluation and treatment of your problem."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am studying french, and every time I conjugate, I get a brain fog. It is the feeling you get when you stare at something. It is very annoying. What can I do to get rid of it? I am trying very hard to concentrate on the spells, but it is not helping me.","Doctor":"Hello. Being a school counselor, I feel that you are having concentration issues while analyzing or solving any query in your academic work. Learning the second language whether it be French or any other, requires much effort in the beginning. Especially when you are at the written or spoken level. Conjugation itself requires much effort and it is alright if you feel like brain fog, because it does happen as I said. Follow these steps: 1. You need to improve your study skills and learn better strategies for this class. 2. Read the class material beforehand and mark your questions. 3. Ask your questions to re-explain things to you, if you have any confusion. 4. Practice helps in skill-building. Learning a language is another skill. Keep practicing and learn verbs and grammar in a gradual manner. 5. French grammar is quite different from the English language. Do not compare it with your previous skill and learn it as a different and new skill. 6. Audio and video aid will be helpful. Search online video aids for better pronunciation and grammar rules for french. 7. For improving concentration, try different language games. 8. Try to study when you have an active mind and make it a daily routine. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 35 years old, and 6 weeks pregnant.

Usually, prenatal vitamins contain vitamin C and you do not need to take any extra supplement. It is better to take it in your diet in the form of citrus fruits and vegetables. However, there are different studies and some recommend a higher dose in pregnancy but the maximum dose is 2000 mg in a day. Take care in the future. It is important to take folic acid at this stage and rather starting it from pre conceptional time.  What is more important is to consult your doctor regularly.

I heard that it may lead to death and if so, how long do I live? Additional information will greatly be appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Well, precautions first - While there is absolutely nothing wrong medically in your sexual orientation, irrespective of the legal status in your state, it is definitely not advisable to have unprotected intercourse with anyone. Even the use of condoms only ensures 95% protection. So in the future, always use a barrier like a condom before intercourse to ensure your own safety and your partner's safety. Not only you could get infected with a venereal disease like syphilis, genital warts, etc., you may get infected with the deadly disease called AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Though there are effective treatments for most of the STDs (sexually transmitted disease), why risk it in the first place. Now coming to your question. Peritonitis is the inflammation of the membranous lining which covers our abdomen and the pelvic area called peritoneum. It gets infected only if there is direct contact of some infected fluid with it and for that, it should have been perforated i.e. ruptured. It often happens when the intestines get ruptured due to typhoid fever, or due to a ruptured peptic ulcer of the stomach or intestine or as a result of trauma. In men, there has never been a case (to the best of my knowledge), where a sexual act has resulted in peritonitis. It cannot happen unless the sexual force has been so vigorous that it resulted in the rupture of the rectal or anal mucosa. Even if it happens rarely because of this, peritonitis has very prominent symptoms like severe pain in the abdomen and you would have needed to be hospitalized. So do not worry. If you are fine and eating well with no pain in the abdomen, your previous coital acts have not given you peritonitis. And you may expect a normal life. Of course, you are risking your life by being at a risk of acquiring deadly STDs like HIV-AIDS, which are killers. So do not worry about peritonitis, but worry about STDs and follow precautions."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a question about my menstrural cycle.

The brown discharge which you are getting now is probably the withdrawal bleeding which you are getting after stopping the pill. This was bound to come. Your cycle date will be irregular this month. However, wait for few days or till 15th and if periods are delayed or abnormal spotting only then get a scan done. In future, I will advise you to use regular cyclical combined contraceptive pills rather than this practice."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a former marathon runner for about 40 years. With age and bad knees, I am restricted to walk now, but I try to walk at least four days a week for 15 minutes. Recently, when I walk for about half a mile, I am getting cramps in my right calf muscles. I am fine on the exercise bike even for an hour, but I prefer to walk outside. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello.  I can understand your concern. I am really proud to talk to a marathon runner. I understand that walking or running is one of the most important part of your life, but with age out joints get weaker, there is a deposition of fluid in between joint spaces, cartilage which gets inflamed leading to arthritis. Normally we associate cramping with dehydration. Make sure you are drinking adequate water both pre and post-workout. However, I will advise you to just rest for a few days. Too much exercise leads to the accumulation of lactic acid in our muscles and it causes severe cramping. This commonly affects sports persons and runners like you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 26-year-old female. I am suffering from halitosis for the past 15 years. Consulted many doctors and they could not find out the reason. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hello. If it is such a long history, it will surely need good investigation, medication and regular check-ups. And as you are saying it is not possible in your area I can only give you oral home remedies which may or may not work without timely scaling. This condition can either be related to your mouth or to your stomach even. Many a times this may be due to stomach conditions, upsets or poor oral hygiene. For now I would suggest you to get a full mouth scaling and root planning done if possible in your area, after that follow these: Drink plenty of water. Avoid things like raw garlic, onion. Take more fresh fruits and vegetables. Chew parsley, it helps. Clean your tongue after you are done with tooth brushing. Floss at least once daily. Rinse off properly after every meal and clean your teeth with fingers. Do warm water and salt rinse three to four times daily. Do not take in more of sugary things as they stay for longer time in your oral cavity and cause bad breath. Keep clove in your mouth. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Can I take Testosterone cypionate and Trenbolone enanthate, while on high blood pressure medication Benicar 20 mg?","Doctor":"Hello. If you have low testosterone and have been given a prescription for using testosterone, after consulting an endocrinologist you can take it. But always remember you should not have very high doses of testosterone since hypertension already puts the cardiac system under some risk for development of coronary artery disease in the future. Even though nothing has been reported scientifically, but doctors believe there is an indirect association between high testosterone and cardiac ailments. As you know men are prone to more heart attacks. So it is better to take it lower doses if it is required medically."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a burning sensation in my waist. I want to know the cause and the treatment for it.","Doctor":"Hello. Burning sensation in and around the waist or torso can indicate a lot of things. It can indicate an allergic reaction, but that seems less likely in your case. Mostly it can point to nerve weakness, which occurs due to vitamin deficiency. I will advise you to get your B12 levels checked as soon as possible. Rarely, the burning sensation can be attributed to kidney stones, however, we will cross that bridge when it is required.  For the time being, I will advise you to start taking some multivitamin supplements such as tablet Cobadex or Neurobion Forte one tablet daily before sleeping. Once you get your B12 levels evaluated, you can post the details and I will assist you further."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 30-year-old-female. I have a fuzzy head mainly in the mornings, and I have read online and regarding this. It includes stuff like elimination of diet, early menopause, etc. I think it may be due to something like this. I have no pain in my head, but sometimes it makes me anxious and feels sick. I also have asthma.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Fuzzy head or brain fog can be due to a lot of causes. Most commonly, patients present to us with a fuzzy head after improper sleep for a long time (insomnia), long term stress at the workplace, too much caffeine, or caffeinated drinks. Some medical causes can be low hemoglobin (anemia), hypotension, weakness due to improper diet, due to malabsorption, etc. We can not attribute the cause to early menopause. Early menopause is considered only when patients get menopause around 35-40 years of age. You are too young to attribute this cause to early menopause.  I will advise you to get the following tests done: 1) CBC (complete blood count). 2) BP (blood pressure) monitoring at least three values. 3) LFT (liver function test). 4) Stool routine. Once you have the reports ready, you can contact us, and we will help you. Make sure that you are not too anxious because stress will further worsen the symptoms. So try to eat well and stay healthy for the time being. Take a multivitamin supplement like Cobadex (vitamin B and C), once daily and also take tablet Evion (vitamin E)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I need to gain weight. Many doctors said that I am not having any problem in my body and I have to eat well. Now I am taking Zincovit syrup. Suggest me some tablet or syrup.","Doctor":"Hello. The syrup you are using is absolutely fine and will take care of your nutrition requirements. The most important factor here is gaining weight in proper shape and taking polyunsaturated fatty acid are helpful to the body and of saturated fatty acids are harmful to body. Now you can get this good fat from fresh fruits, mixing milk and banana every morning and evening and eating that. If you are eating eggs, then you can also eat boiled eggs or different dishes of eggs with less oil. Basically, along with this syrup, you also need to increase your healthy diet and have to work out. Otherwise, after few years, you will have this weight gain as a problem and will be searching for medicine to reduce it. So keep up your diet and work out 30-45 minutes regularly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 15-year-old female. The day before my period I got bad cramps and they stopped before I go to bed. On the day of my periods, my stomach is making weird noises and I feel that it is filled with gas and getting little cramps. What is my problem?","Doctor":"Hello. There is autonomic nervous dysfunction before the period comes, and this period can stretch as long as 14 days before your period. You may experience bloating due to excess gas discomfort in your back and pelvis. Weird sound in your tummy, constipation, diarrhea, and general ill-being are collectively called PMS (premenstrual syndrome). It usually subsides within a few days of you getting your period. So, in my opinion, you are probably facing PMS, be assured to take lots of water. Try to keep your bowel motions regular. Avoid oily junk foods around that period, and you will be good in no time. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 25-year-old female. I have been on the contraceptive Implanon for about seven months now. In the last three months, I had a bit of spotting, which has now turned into consistent bleeding for the last two months. Before this, I was on Depo Provera for seven years and never got my periods. I had tried hormone patches after my doctor suggestion them, and they did not help me. Now I have tried Nurofen every six hours for 48 hours, and it has stopped the bleeding completely. My question is, how long does this normally last? Is it the wear off due to anti-inflammatory, or is this something that stops the spotting or bleeding until the normal next cycle? I want to know, will I have some relief for awhile as I know I cannot keep taking this medication due to the risks. I do not have health issues or medications other than a contraceptive. I stopped the Depo Provera because it reduces my bone density.","Doctor":"Hello. There are many ways of contraception. You can use barrier methods like condoms by your husband or a copper T. One more thing is if your cycles are regular like say every 30 days, then 14 days before the next period is your ovulation day. You can also observe your vaginal mucus, which becomes like a thread that indicates ovulation. Being cautious during ovulation prevent pregnancy, your nitrogen has nothing to do with your bleeding,it is just an anti-inflammatory do not use it. Implanon sometimes causes bleeding then stops on its own. My advice is to get it removed and go for a barrier method, which is easy to use and takes no lag time to get back to normal physiological cycle without any delay."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

Everyone goes through this phase in their sexual life when they doubt their performance naturally and start using tablets or supplements for a better sexual life. If you are a strong, healthy male, without any medical problem, then you will be able to enjoy intercourse naturally, and there is no need for any tablets. Tablets such as Manforce 100 (Sildenafil Citrate) or Viagra can cause a lot of side effects, like headache, delay in ejaculation, priapism, etc. Kindly refrain from using such tablets and also advise your friends not to use it.

It is accompanied by pain, which feels like it is in the urethra. The frequency of urination is every 30 minutes, sometimes immediately after using the restroom. I was never sick before, so I am a little concerned.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. You have not given adequate history. Did you have any unprotected sexual intercourse in recent days? Are you at risk for STD (sexually transmitted disease)? If so, then frequent urination and burning accompanied by some pain can signify some STD. For fever and sore throat, I will advise you saline water gargling. Do it three to four times a day and avoid cold food for the next few days. If you do not have STD scare, then you can have tablet Ciplox (Ciprofloxacin) 500 mg twice a day after food, for five to seven days, and your symptoms will resolve. If you do have STD scare, then I suggest taking tablet Doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for seven to ten days, depending on your severity.

Diane-35 is taken for 21 consecutive days with seven days off. The next cycle is started after seven days off on the eighth day, irrespective of the periods. Though in majority of cases there are periods in those seven days, rarely there may not be periods. Hope your other investigations, mainly CBC (complete blood count), blood sugar, TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) and Prolactin are normal. PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) also requires lifestyle modification which includes avoiding high calorie diet, regular exercise and brisk walk."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My periods have been heavier ever since I got chickenpox three years back. The first two days it is just spotting, the third day it starts with cramps sometimes really severe, with sharp and excruciating pain on both sides of the lower abdomen, radiating to the inner sides of legs, warm legs, back pain, dizziness, exhausted feeling, sleepiness, black moods. Then on the fourth and fifth days, I experience heavy bleeding along with cramps. There are clots. The bleeding is very red and not viscous, when clots are discharged. If I sit down for a while, it is like the clots get accumulated and when I get up, so much is discharged all of a sudden, and I am forced to stay at home. This affects my professional and personal life quite a lot. After this period, the bleeding tapers off fast. But I do feel exhausted, and it takes me days to get back to normal. My blood tests and pelvic ultrasound have come back normal. The only thing is that my hemoglobin is at 11.3. Thyroid test and LFT are normal. No fibroid and ovaries are normal. My doctor is not able to figure out what is wrong. I just turned 37. My child is 8 years old. My pregnancy was normal and uneventful. I gave birth to a full-term baby through NVD. What could be wrong? Should I undergo any further tests? Since my tests are normal, can I have another child? Will another pregnancy solve my issues with menstruation? My periods were regular with a cycle of 28 days, even now it is regular with these problems.","Doctor":"Hello. Chickenpox usually does not have anything to do with heavy periods. You seem to be suffering from severe PMS (premenstrual syndrome) with dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia. You have not mentioned about the prolactin level. I presume it is to be of normal value. If you have not done it, please do so. I also presume you are non-diabetic with no high blood pressure. Does the ultrasound mention about the size of the uterus? Is it of normal size? If no pathology could be found out, then you belong to a group of patient who is believed to be having dysfunctional uterine bleeding mostly seen at the perimenopausal age group roughly say beyond 35 years. They usually get relieved by a progesterone course for six months, or in refractory cases, a simple operative procedure called Dilation and Curettage does the trick. I believe your doctor must have already suggested that, or maybe you are on it right now. Regarding bearing children, I do not see why you should not conceive, and there might be normalization of your symptoms after a second pregnancy. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Right ovary contains 3.6x2.1x3.1cm cyst, thick septation and few punctate echogenic lesions within lumen. Previously cyst measured 3.8x2.4cm abutting ovary. Adjacent ovarian parenchyma contains 6 mm and 15 mm follicles. Small amount of fluid was seen in para-adnexal area and posterior CDS. My questions are: 1. Small amount of fluid in para-adnexal area and posterior CDS. Is this normal? Why is it there? 2. The 6 mm and 15 mm follicles in ovarian parenchyma. Are these normal to be there? 3. What is the thick septation and how is it formed? 4. What are the lesions in my lumen? I believe it is ovarian lumen. Do they form normally with ovarian cysts? They are echogenic so sounds like they may be solid. Could they be malignant? 5. Finally, what type of cyst will this fall under? My doctors are not giving me any specific name and I really need to know what kind of cyst name it falls under. I did a blood report and my blood work is normal. My weight is normal and I feel minimal symptoms. So far this cyst has little impact on my quality of life. What are the most worrisome parts of this report? Can I still get pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello. I will try to give you answers to the best of my knoweldge. Small amount of fluid is expected near posterior cul de sac and para adnexal area during ovulation time. Although it can be seen during pelvic inflammatory disease. Multiple follicle grow every month in both the ovaries which later on is dominated by a single follicle which continues to grow to a certain size, and later ruptures releasing the egg. So your 6 mm and 15 mm follicles are normal to be there. Without doing a histopathological examination, it is difficult to tell about the origin of the thick septation but as most of the ovarian cysts are epitheleal in origin, so 90 % chances are they are made of some kind of epitheleal tissue. Any kind of debris inside the cyst will give rise to echogenicity in USG. It could be blood, it could be tissues of different origin. There are different types of ovarian cyst, to rule out malignancy you need to do certain tumor markers like CA 125, etc., and MRI or CT scan. Since it is receding in size, my best guess that your cyst is some kind of retention cyst of ovary. There is a large possibility that the cyst will regress soon. I think your cyst is an incidental finding as you have stated there is minimal symptom. Your gynecologist will be the best person to advise you in this matter. So discuss with her about the various possibilities and methods of treatment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I get light burning and discomfort after I have been on antibiotics and sterioids.

How is your urine stream? Good or bad. There might be subclinical infection in your urine which is causing this. I suggest you get below tests done if possible and take below medicines. Urine routine, culture and sensitivity, uroflowmetry. Take: 1. Syrup Cital 10 ml in glass of water in morning, afternoon and evening for one month. 2. Tablet Flavospas 1 tablet in morning, afternoon and evening for one month. Urine color might appear red with Flavospas.

You did not mention your height and weight and any previous history, if any. The weight of a person should be proportional to its height.You can calculate it by BMI (body mass index). If your BMI is below 18.5 then you are underweight and you need to gain weight. First of all, take healthy diet. Take carbohydrates, proteins and fats in proportinal amount. You need all of them. Add milk in your diet. Milk helps in weight gain. You can take two eggs daily if you used to take them. Take banana with milk, this combination helps in weight gain. You also get a diet chart from a dietician, if you want to. Do exercises which will increase your muscle bulk because as muscle bulk will increase it will help in gaining weight. You can learn these type of exercises from a gym nearby you or from professional trainers. You can use Ayurvedic granules named Nutrigain to gain weight. These granules have substances like Ashwgandha, Draksha, Khajur, etc., which have weight gain properties. Take two teaspoons of these granules twice a day with lukewarmwater or preferably with milk. Do not smoke and drink. Sleep adequately for 6 to 8 hours daily. Lack of diet or hormonal imbalance. Thyroid function test.

But I always think I am infected with HIV because I have symptoms, and medicine is not helping me. So I am planning for the HIV PCR test now. My question is : 1) What is the suspicious cause of this problem(gastritis with diarrhea)? I guess my problem is sexual infection. Before this, I never faced these problems, and it has not happened due to my lifestyle and food habits. 2)Is my HIV test conclusive for HIV? 3)I do not have IBS. Only HIV, HBV, HCV, TB cause these symptoms or another virus can also lead this sickness? 4)Advice me for more tests to rule out the reason for sickness.What can I do now? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query and understand your concerns. First of all, I feel there is neither HIV nor any sexually transmitted infections. This is because repeated tests without any evidence of infection are enough to tell that there is nothing concrete in this regard. Now coming to your questions.  1. The most likely cause of your problem is stress. You might be aware that stress affects your gastrointestinal system severely and can cause a variety of symptoms, including stomach ache and loose motions. 2. Yes, it is conclusive 99 % although PCR will make it 100%. 3. The chronological association between the stress after unprotected sexual encounter and development of gastrointestinal symptoms indicates the virus are not the cause including HIV. 4. I think you need to see a mental health professional for a possible diagnosis of hypochondriasis and relevant treatment. There is no test to diagnose hypochondriasis other than the interaction with a mental health professional. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 28-year-old male, in good shape and exercise 5 to 6 times per week. Lately, I have been feeling weird flutters in my chest. Started wearing a heart rate monitor. It showed my average resting heart rate at 44 BPM, which seems low. Noticed these symptoms are happening almost daily and heightened if I drink any alcohol (1 or 2 beers). Recently, did an ECG. It looked normal. I did another one when my heart felt fluttery and showed some weird results.","Doctor":"Hello. Do you feel as if your heart is racing? Have you ever noticed any dizziness or fainting? Is there any family history of heart disease? Since it started has it been progressing? It could be palpitations you are experiencing which are often benign. But I will love for you to upload the ECG result, let me study to make sure there is no underlying pathology. Best regards."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from iridocyclitis in my right eye since last six months. Every time when I stop my Pred Forte eye drops, it recurs after one month, till now it has recurred three times. I have tested for TB, anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-CCP antibodies, HLAB27 all are negative. But still the problem is not going. I have hypothyroidism since last five years, my ophthalmologist is not able to find out any reason for the same. Kindly suggest what should I do, whether it is related to autoimmune disease.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your history and investigations (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Well firstly iridocyclitis (anterior uveitis) is mostly an autoimmune problem. We can only find a definite cause in 30 percent cases. So, when it is a single episode we tend to ignore it but when you have recurrent episodes (more than twice a year) we need to treat it. So, even if all are negative and you are getting recurrent episodes it needs to be treated. HLAB 27 method done is an outdated one. You can request them to do by PCR method as it holds importance in your diagnosis. You can discuss with your ophthalmologist. As the treatment needs to be accelerated, we need to start you on DMARDS as for iridocyclitis only few drugs are useful. My preference would be Methotrexate but we will need to discuss with your ophthamologist once."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a question. On Tuesday I went to go get tested with my fiance for COVID because we thought his dad may have had it since at his job there were so many infected. We showed no symptoms but to be safe we went. After then I have not seen him just in case. Today I got my results and I was negative but he was positive. Does that mean the virus can still get to me? I was supposed to go back to work tomorrow and I have showed no symptoms. Do I need to get tested again? Like I said since that day I have not seen him.","Doctor":"Hi. I understand you are worried about COVID infection. You need to understand that if COVID test result shows positive, then it is sure that the person has the infection, but if the result shows negative that does not prove that the person does not have the infection. The person can still be a asymptomatic carrier of COVID. So, at present scenario with huge number of population affected and you being in close proximity with COVID positive patients, I would suggest you to repeat the test after 7 days if you do not develop any symptoms or earlier itself if you develop any symptoms. And since your boyfriend has tested positive, you satisfy the criteria of COVID close contact. You need to isolate yourself at home for 2 weeks. And you also need to inform your health officials regarding this. COVID close contact"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My fiance began exhibiting psychotic symptoms nine days ago. He is 38 years old. He has no prior psych history or hospitalization. He is diagnosed with mild depression NOS. He takes Lexapro, Wellbutrin, and Suboxone. We know that this episode is not substance induced. He is currently hospitalized in a psych facility and we still have no diagnosis.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Psychotic symptoms can be precipitated by different causes like intense stress, affective disorder, psychotic disorder, use of illicit substances, sometimes due to organic problems in the brain (like epilepsy, lesion, inflammation, etc.). In a way it is good to know that your fiance is safe in a hospital where assessment and diagnostic work-up can be completed. You reported that it is not substance induced. Mental health professionals will need to observe him and complete the assessment to clarify the etiology of the psychotic symptoms. It can take some time to arrive at a definitive diagnosis but they may have a provisional working diagnosis. Kindly discuss with your treating team for more clarity."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, After a year of attempting to become pregnant through natural means, my wife and I just went through our first use of assisted reproductive technology. We had an IVF/ICSI. Six eggs were produced, my fresh semen sample was used, three eggs became embryos, two embryos were transferred on the third day after retrieval and no sac was ever found. Is there any other information that would be helpful? We plan to try again and would like to learn from this experience and our personal medical data to improve our chances. We would like to know: 1. What happened that terminated the process (no sacs were found) and why? What are the possibilities and what is the most likely possibility? 2. What could we do differently now that might be better? 3. What is the quality of the embryos overall and in terms of their number of cells, cell appearance score, fragmentation and cells being of equal size? 4. What might have contributed to any problem with the embryos? 5. What can be done to improve the quality of the embryos? 6. What is the quality of my sperm overall and in terms of motility, morphology, round cells, agglutination, debris, etc.? 7. If I abstain for 5 or more days, there are no motile sperm. Is that normal? 8. What might have contributed to any problem with my sperm? 9. What can be done to improve the quality of the sperms? 10. Is it unusual or problematical to have a sperm concentration of 0 whenever abstinence is 5 or more days?","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Following are answers to your queries,  1. The process you experienced is likely biochemical pregnancy. It mostly happens when embryos do not have the potential to grow and give healthy live birth as outcome. The cause of many such losses is unknown, but most likely lies in the genetic aberrations in the embryo.  2. The success rate of any ART procedure is not 100 %. As there was pregnancy in the first attempt and most of the things appear fine, there is good chance of pregnancy in subsequent cycle. For oligoasthenospermia (low sperm count, motility), we generally prescribe antioxidants to male partner to improve sperm health and to reduce oxidative stress. You can discuss with your doctor for the same. The simplest nonprescription antioxidants are vitamin A, C and E. You can take supplements containing same for not more than three months (Vitamin C not more than 15 to 30 days). Co-enzyme Q is another good antioxidant.  3. The images of embryos you attached is 2-dimensional. To assess quality we need to see 3D view to be able to see all the cells in embryos. But still, looking at the first embryo, it appears to be of good quality, with cells of equal size and almost no fragmentation. The second one has unequal cells, though it might happen when cells are dividing. There appears around 10 % fragmentation in second embryo, still it appears fine. Both appear suitable for transfer (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  4. The answer lies in point 1.  5. The quality of embryos looking at morphology is already good. Still, if ovarian reserve of wife is on lower side, DHEA 75 mg daily might help, though evidence supporting its use is not so strong.  6. Quality of sperm in terms of morphology cannot be assessed from the given video. As far as round cells, agglutination, debris are concerned, all these do not affect ISCI outcome, as sperm processing takes care of those factors. Regarding motility, it appears fine.  7. The more the abstinence, lesser will be motility in semen sample. As the baseline motility itself is low, this phenomenon is normal. Nothing to worry about it. 8. There appears to be no problem. So cannot hypothesize any reason.  9. Please refer to point no. 2. Also you can reduce exposure of heat to testes if it is there.  10. Sperm concentration generally does not become zero after increased abstinence, but motility might reduce."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been having multiple issues for one year now. Mostly around lack of energy, feeling spaced out, feeling faint, weight loss and stomach. For 8 weeks, my occipital lymph node is hard maybe about 1 cm in size. It is in line with my left ear lobe and on the hairline. So not right behind my ear but more towards the back of my head. I have been having strange on and off headaches, shoulder aches or flu like symptoms but without fever. I can feel good for a week then I am just whacked out tired and low for a week. Physical activities just makes me feel weak and shaky. Last night I woke up in the night with random face, ear, neck itching but not all over. It would be pin point and changes position. Never had this in my life. I also have low testosterone and using Testogel for nine months. My last two blood controls showed all bloods to be normal with basophils at 1 % but the absolute basophils were 120 ul (normal range states 10 to 70 ul). The second control from one week ago showed same results. Bloods from one year ago showed normal absolute results and a lower basophilia percentage at 0.7 %. Sometimes, I am also having episodes where it is like an allergic reaction and I cannot breathe so good or my throat is closing. This is quite frightening and I get panic. Usually sleep helps this. So I am wondering if there is a link between the node and the absolute basophils. Do I need to get any further tests?","Doctor":"Hello. I have read your concern and below is my opinion for your case. The itching, headache, flu like symptoms and throat blockage are suggestive of some form of allergic inflammation of upper respiratory tract. The basophils count is also slightly high, so allergic inflammation seems most likely (attachment removed to protect patient identity). During that allergic episode you can be prescribed Levocetirizine plus Montelukast combination for five to seven days. The allergic inflammation can cause fatigue as well. If your fatigue is persistent than investigate further with calcium estimation, serum TSH estimation for further work up to exclude any low calcium and hypothyroid problem. For allergy, you can be investigated for allergy testing by allergy specialist doctor to find out causative allergen. The enlarged lymph node can be reactive enlargement of lymph node. But if it is persistently enlarged, then investigate further with FNAC for further work up to rule out nature of enlarged node. The node can be enlarged due to allergic inflammation as well. So it can be related to high Basophil. Your cholesterol value is also slightly high. So, you need to control fat intake in diet and do regular exercise. If you are obese, then lose weight by diet and exercise. Finally, let me tell you that anxiety and chronic depression also can cause weakness. So if any such history is present then let me know about that."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 36 years old, male. Recently I am not feeling as much libido as it used to be.

I immediately rinsed it out and continued to do so for 15 minutes under the tap water. Will the spray affect my vision?","Doctor":"Hello. It seems from the history that a pest killer went into your eye, and you have immediately washed the eye for 15 minutes. It is a good thing you have done by washing the eye. This is the first line of treatment, and you have done it. The next mode of treatment depends on the symptoms. The general treatment is the use of antibiotic eye drops and artificial tears eye drops. If you are having symptoms of pain, irritation, redness, discharge, watering, blurring of vision, then you need to consult your doctor for an examination to assess any damage to the cornea and other vital structures and treat accordingly. Hence as of now, you can use antibiotic eye drops like Ciprofloxacin and artificial tears eye drops like Refresh tears and do consult your eye doctor for further examination and treatment. If you have washed the eyes immediately following fall of pesticide and if the quantity of the pesticide is small no problem will occur and it will not affect vision.

It is so hot that I felt like it had been in the microwave for too long. I felt the heat going down my throat, burning from the esophagus into the stomach. I rushed in and drank water, but it felt like the damage was done. Today I am struggling with eating and drinking. The pain down the center of my body is excruciating when I swallow something. I am having constant pain in the middle of my chest and back, sort of under my ribs, and the back of my throat feels like I have the worse sore throat ever. I feel sick all the time. I have two questions. Can I take some Codine to numb the pain, or will this make my stomach worse? What medicine can I take to help my insides heal?","Doctor":"Hello.  I understand your concern. When you consume hot drinks, it can irritate the lining of the throat and the esophageal mucosa. There may be small burns, as you know, that happens to our tongue when we have something very hot. There is nothing to worry about. I will advise you to stick to a bland diet for the next three to four days. Any spicy food will make it worse. Have more of cold milk, cereals, and curd. These being cold will soothe the lining while passing through the tract. You can take Paracetamol, for your pain, but only after the food. Also, take Sucralfate two tablespoons twice daily, after food for the next three to five days based on your symptoms. This syrup will form a protective coat around the area that has the lesion and help in healing. You should be feeling better in a couple of days. There is nothing to worry about.

The color of the phlegm is generally white, but sometimes it is slightly yellow. I need to know, should I consult a pulmonologist? I fear that I may have chronic bronchitis since I have been smoking from the age of 15.","Doctor":"Hello. You said that you smoke since, from the age of 15, so the diagnosis goes more in favor of chronic bronchitis. The symptoms are also typical of chronic bronchitis. But you have not mentioned any associated allergic symptoms like running nose or frequent sneezing as it suggests bronchial asthma. The best test to differentiate between both is to do a spirometry test, also called PFT (pulmonary function test). It will give a definitive final diagnosis. Regarding treatment, if it is bronchitis, the first and most important thing is to quit smoking. If it is asthma, then you need to take a controller inhaler regularly. Also, you should get done with your chest x-ray. I hope after reading this, you will take the initiative for quitting smoking and quit it ultimately. I hope this helps. Smoking.

Thoracic scoliosis noted. Heart, costopherenic sulci, and other structures are intact. I am concerned about mid lung fibrosis and thoracic scoliosis. Will they seriously affect my health? What is the cure for them?","Doctor":"Hello. Please clarify whether it is mid or mild lung fibrosis reported. As you said, the chest x-ray reports mid or mild lung fibrosis, it is suggestive of some old infection or some autoimmune disease causing idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Even you could not have remembered. If you know, definitely it is due to some old lung infection. So nothing to worry about it as long as you do not have any symptoms. But if you experience cough with expectoration, cold, and fever, then you should check your sputum test. Accordingly, medicines can be prescribed if required. Mostly we are worried about infection with tuberculosis. If your sputum test is positive for TB (tuberculosis), then you should take regular antitubercular medicines full course under the supervision of your doctor. If not TB, then you should not worry about anything. Only antibiotics are sufficient for curing common infections. To rule out IPF, you should get done HRCT (high resolution computed tomography) scan chest for some underlying autoimmune interstitial lung disease. About your second query, scoliosis is the abnormal lateral curving of the thoracic spine. It suggests underlying osteoporosis or any other bone problem in the thoracic spine. In advanced age, it is common to have slight scoliosis in the spine due to various reasons. So again, there is nothing to worry about it. You do not need any treatment for your problem until some infection or cause of fibrosis is proved out. Any infection or advanced age or some spine disease. Sputum AFB (acid-fast bacillus) test and culture, HRCT (high resolution computed tomography) scan thorax to rule out IPF (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis).

I have been suffering from nightfall for one and a half years. I feel dizzy, tired, and have no concentration. Please suggest me a good medicine to cure it. Is NFcure capsules a good option in curing it?","Doctor":"Hello. The very first advice is not to worry about the nightfall. According to Ayurveda and Siddha, it is due to the excess heat in gonads. I have treated many patients with the following drugs and advice. 1) Stop drinking water or liquid two hours before sleep. If you are going to bed at 10 pm, then your last drink of water or juice should be before 8 pm. The more fullness of urinary bladder is one of the causes of nightfall. Urinate before bed. In between, if you wake up from bed, pass urine. 2) Try to sleep on the left side of the body or supine (looking upwards). Avoid sleeping on the right side (right-lateral) or facing downwards. 3) Buy Brahmi hair oil or Amla hair oil. Apply ten drops on the top of the head at 6.30 am. Rub with right hand on the head. After one hour, take a bath in normal water. You may use warm water also. This should be done daily in the morning. 4) Shatavari legium 5 gm (one teaspoon) should be consumed in the morning and evening before food for four months. 5) Before sleeping, keep your both feet on the basin containing room temperature water for 30 minutes then wipe with a towel. Then apply cow ghee or sesame oil on the foot. Then go to bed. This practice will reduce the heat in genitals. 6) Drink tender coconut water, cucumber juice, fruit juices. Avoid tea and coffee. This will stop your nightfall."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 17 years old female. I had one kiwi, and it makes my mouth hurt, but it was not too bad, and I liked the flavor. I just managed it. I decided to have two kiwis yesterday, and then my mouth and tongue were tingly and itchy. My stomach was disturbed, and there was a kind of short of breath, and my heart rate increased two hours afterward. Am I allergic?","Doctor":"Hello. You are right the symptoms you perceived could be because of kiwi allergy. This is called oral allergy syndrome or pollen food syndrome. The raw proteins in fruit or peel of the fruit cause allergic symptoms. It may occur with certain other fruits, also like peach, apple, etc. So if you are having symptoms after eating these fruits, you should try to avoid them. Though not very severe, it can cause serious respiratory problems like difficulty in breathing, coughing and palpitations. For minor reactions, you can take tablet Levocetirizine 5 mg daily to prevent tingling and itching. For more severe reactions, you should always be carrying self-injecting adrenaline injection. For confirming oral allergy syndrome, I advise you to do a skin prick allergy test. You can also do a full blood allergy test with all panels, including environmental, food, drugs, and allergens in the test. After you are diagnosed with a particular allergy, avoidance is only the best thing that will prevent severe allergic reactions. I also advise you to take the help of the allergy doctor for further help if required. Fruit protein allergy. Skin prick allergy test or Blood allergy test. Food allergy.

It comes as hereditary. It leaves spots, scars, and holes on face. This problem appears majorly in humid weather conditions. I am currently on homeopathic treatment.","Doctor":"Hello. Acne or pimples is a very common condition seen in the teenage years and early twenties due to the hormonal changes occurring in your body. There is no need to worry about it. Even if it does reduce, the chances are that you may get another bout of acne over your face. Hence it is more important that you avoid fiddling or pressing the lesions since it will leave scars and pigmentation, which takes a long time to go. Acne treatment is usually given according to the grade of acne you have, which can range from Grade I (mild) to Grade 4 (very severe). Also, the treatment varies from topical cream applications, chemical peeling, dermabrasion, and in severe cases, oral medications. As you have not mentioned the area involved over the face and types of lesions (e.g., blackheads or red spots or pustules) I will suggest the following treatment for the time being: 1) Adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, to be applied over the pimples in a pea-size amount at night. Stop if there are any redness and irritation. 2) Do use a good moisturizer if there is any dryness. 3) For pigmentation or dark spots, you can use a depigmenting cream containing kojic acid over the spots at night. 4) Scars treatment can be only suggested after looking at the scars. Do follow up with good clear photographs of the lesions for a better solution."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was suffering a lot with pain, discomfort and not concentrating on my studies, a small pimple like structure raised at my anal section.

Based on your description, it might be haemorrhoid or perianal abscess. If it is in a lower grade, some medical therapy may be proven to ease the pain and inflammation. But a medical consultation would be neccessary to determine that condition. Anyway, you can try a local cream containing Betamethasone and Lidocaine twice daily. A stool softener such as Lactulose would help for an easier and less painful bowel movement. Keep a watery diet with soups and high fibers foods. Have plenty of liquids. Sitz baths would help a lot.

And I do not have any other symptoms.","Doctor":"Hi. According to your statement you have been suffering from childhood asthma and for the last 20 days your asthma is totally uncontrolled. Your present medication is Formost 200 respicaps which is a combination of long acting bronchodilator as Formeterol with corticosteroid as Momentasone.and your query is whether you are COVID-19 positive or not.  COVID-19 usually attacks the respiratory tract first then eventually other systems. As you are a diagnosed patient of childhood asthma so you are more vulnerable to develop COVID-19 positive. I do not know whether you are quarantined or not. You had exposure history or not. So you should undergo some investigations like antigen test for active infection and antibody test for previously infected by COVID-19. You can also undergo CXR and Pulse oximetry for monitoring of oxygen saturation rate. You can take nebulization with Salbutamol and Salbutamol inhaler 6 hourly or SOS with Fexofenadine and Montelukast along with steroid orally."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I need to tighten up my body. Is it advisable to take Whey protein or fiber powders? If so, suggest a good brand. If not, help me with foods that tighten the lower abdomen.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  You can definitely get a more toned body. However, you need to work out four to five times a week, maybe around 40 minutes a day, and also give adequate rest to your muscles. Have high protein foods such as eggs (whites), chicken, turkey, etc.  For protein supplements, any supplement with pure whey isolate is preferable. Make sure you are adequately hydrated and follow the proper guidelines mentioned in the supplement box. Working out, along with a proper diet, should be able to give you a nice toned body in a couple of weeks. Please make sure you drink adequate water while using the supplement, otherwise it can cause renal stones in the future."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

I underwent bladder surgery to lengthen ureters at the age of five. Medication for bladder spasms taken as needed. I have frequent bladder infections and poor bladder control when laughing or moving. Sometimes it is impossible to control when laughing.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  I understand it must be really distressing for you. You have regular cystitis, and incontinence. You also have a history of bladder surgery in the past. Incontinence (poor bladder control) can be due to a lot of causes: neuropathy, stress incontinence, urge incontinence, cystitis, and bladder diseases. But the good news is it can be controlled with some lifestyle modifications. You need to consult a urologist who can guide you with some pelvic muscle training exercises, also famously known as the kegel exercises. You can even youtube it and practice regularly. It is better to get yourself evaluated since the cause has to be located. You can go for a cystoscopy test or an x-ray of the bladder (cystogram), and PVR test (post voidal residue test). All these will give a better picture of why you have repeated infections and also guide in the further course of management.  There are certain medicines such as anticholinergics (Oxybutinine), Imipramine (Tricyclic antidepressants), which have some positive effects in incontinence. However, please consult your urologist before taking any medicine. Also, there are some surgical options such as sling procedure, which helps in bladder control, especially in situations where there is some increased abdominal pressure like laughing or straining. So you have plenty of options, but first, get the investigations done and then consult your urologist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 25-year-old single female. I am in a painful situation. For the past two years, I have left side back pain starting from shoulder to bottom, and it is very painful like vein tightening. That pain continues and reaches my breast.

Get mammography done for both breasts along with sonography of both the breasts. You can take painkillers. But let the surgeon examine first and decide is there any chance of malignancy or not. From the reports, there will be some guide towards whether there is cancer or not. And if nothing is there and it turns out to be normal, then you have to consult with an orthopedic and a neurophysician for their opinion about your pain. Do not think negative. Everything will be fine. Just be positive. First of all, you have to diagnose what it is and why the pain is there. Once the diagnosis is made, the doctor will tell you what to do and what to expect. Once this part is over, and pain is decreased or the problem is solved, then you can think of increasing the size of the breast. The plastic surgeon will help you with that. So do not worry.

I have consulted two ENT specialists and looking for another opinion. Two years ago, I started to get a dry mouth when I was nervous (it is soon after I got a hair transplant, and I was very conscious of my image and recovery). That was the first time I ever experienced a dry mouth. Unfortunately, the dry mouth had developed into a more prominent and chronic issue (even when I am not nervous or anxious) and is now present almost all of the time. Generally, it feels like I do not have enough saliva, or it is foamy. I am very conscious of it when I talk, and it does prevent me from talking a lot. If I sweat more than usual, my mouth will become dry. I try to drink one to two liters of water a day, but it does not make too much difference. The only time I do not have a dry mouth is when I am eating or drinking, and for about 15 minutes afterwards. I have got many blood tests done, and all are in range except for neutrophils, which is slightly below range at 1.5, but this appears to be normal for me, and the hormone estradiol is also below range. The doctor has ruled out Sjogren's syndrome or autoimmune also. Both ENT doctors said that this would clear up by itself, and that was possibly anxiety related. I did go on SSRIs for one year, but this made my dry mouth much worse. One of the ENT doctor said to try lemon and lime juice three times a day to encourage the salivary glands to start working properly again, but I have not noticed any difference. I have tried most of the salivary substitutes and gum, but most of them are just temporary fixes. Is there anything else I should do to find the cause like an MRI or CT or any other avenue I should explore?","Doctor":"Hello. Dry mouth can be a very distressing thing. However, I need to know certain details. Kindly be as objective as possible when you answer. 1. When the SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) started for this purpose? Do you have a doctor's prescription detailing the same? 2. Are you still on SSRI? 3. Is there any other sort of anxiety or worry? 4. Is there any difficulty or burning sensation while chewing or swallowing? 5. Is there any lump sensation or choking feeling in the throat? 6. Do you get a good sleep in the night? 7. What is your height in centimeters and weight in kilograms? 8. Do you snore? 9. Have you tried saliva sprays? 10. Do you smoke or drink or use any drugs? Do you smoke weed or chew tobacco? 11. Do you suffer from diabetes or blood pressure or hypothyroidism for which you have to take medicines regularly? 12. Is there any oral sexual practice that might be causing such a dryness? 13. Could you take a picture of an open mouth showing details of the oral cavity and send me? We shall help you find a solution to this problem. But please provide as many details as possible so that we arrive at a decisive diagnosis. If possible, kindly upload the opinions of previous ENT specialists."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a 4 weeks old baby boy. He was healthy without any pain or colics.

He vomits four to five times or even more after feeding and also has a lot of hiccups. I feed him in the upright position. His stomach looks like a balloon, and he is having a problem to excrete.

From the way that you are describing, it looks like this is your first baby. Please note that the weight of your baby is perfect, and all the phenomena that you described are completely normal at this age group. But the hernia is definitely a concern.

This was after self irrigating the ear with one of those squeezy syringes that come with the Otex ear drops. Before doing this, I was putting in oil drops for about a week prior. Quite a bit of wax came out, but now I have this hissing noise in my ear which gets worse when listening to podcasts and music at low-medium levels. It also seems to become more pronounced when I chew. I have had a subtle amount of ear pain over the past week but that seems to have gone now, but the hissing sound has not improved at all. I am worried I may have applied too much pressure when squeezing the ear syringe and have damaged my eardrum. I was wondering if this will heal over time and the tinnitus will go away? I cannot go see a GP due to Corona, so an opinion would be much appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi. It is always dangerous to predict and take action in case of their own health. The tinnitus in your case is not due to earwax, it may be due to the blockage of the eustachian tube (tube connecting middle ear and back of the nasal cavity, its primary work is to equalize pressure between environment and middle ear). This is also a prediction. The real cause can be found after an ear examination, as you have already mentioned nowadays it is a little hard to go for treatment. What you can do is practice some no side effect formulas. Steam inhalation, start sipping lukewarm water. For tinnitus, use resound relief app which has so many natural sound combos. Use that in speaker mode, never use earphones. Do not put oil and do not do the treatment on your own unknowingly you are worsening the conditions."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am married for two years now.

On the day of planned intercourse, you double the dose to 10 mg in the night. Try doing this for four weeks and get back to me. Along with this I suggest taking one Eract X (Pyridoxine Hydrochloride and L- Arginine granules) sachet with a glass of milk every night for four weeks.

A recommended follow up ultrasound with doppler showed a 4.3 X 4.7 X 4.8 cm ill-defined heterogeneous hyperechoic mass. The mass showed blood flow around the peripheral. The report said it might be a splenic hemangioma, but that other benign or malignant lesions or metastatic focus cannot be entirely excluded. My spleen is mildly enlarged for about 16 cm. All of my blood work came back normal, except one for inflammation. I have a followup CT scan with contrast (drink) scheduled. I am extremely anxious and scared if it is splenic angiosarcoma. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. As you mentioned that it might be splenic haemangioma as per USG (ultrasonography) with Doppler, let me relieve you by stating that it is one of the rarest condition affecting the spleen, one of the commonest benign condition and has no malignant potential. So do not fear about Angiosarcoma. Though it is mostly asymptomatic may present with abdominal discomfort (pain), breathing difficulty, hemorrhage (spontaneous rupture), or diarrhea. If symptomatic splenectomy is the choice of treatment, the size of haemangioma ranges from 0.3 to 7 cm. Your haemangioma size ranges in the medium range, and this has a very low growing potential. Kindly review with CECT (contrast-enhanced computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or nuclear imaging. These investigations have more sensitivity and specificity to diagnose splenic haemangiomas. As you are asymptomatic and I have already mentioned that splenic haemangiomas have very slow growing potential, so no need for surgery at present. Taking asymptomatic CECT yearly once to keep track of the size of the haemangioma will be essential. Once again, let me assure you that it does not have malignant potential."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I would like to know what happens biologically in the body, causing a burning sensation in the tongue when a person has HIV.","Doctor":"Hello. As you very well knew, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) virus lives in a body for a very long time. It causes significant damage to the central and peripheral nervous systems. The virus affects our nervous system and causes dysfunction of nerves and muscle cells. The burning sensation is a symptom of peripheral nervous system dysfunction or disorder, and it is caused as the nerves that lead to and from the spinal cord and connect with all the various parts of the body are affected by HIV. The nerve root gets exposed, and the person feels burning sensation or numbness, starting with hands, feet, and tongue.

Regarding you not getting your period till date I am a little concerned here. As you have mentioned you had little bleeding during the last cycle, then your ovulation might have been delayed as well leading to mess up of your safe and unsafe days. My advise is to wait for one week more and wait for your period to come. If not, then go for a urine pregnancy test again after one week. The symptoms you are having could be due to PMS.

How to use it, and how many days it requires to cure the dull skin and become fairer again? Please give advice.","Doctor":"Hello. Melacare cream that you have been using is essentially a triple composition of Mometasone Furoate steroid, Tretinoin, and Hydroquinone. It is not meant for regular use. This cream is a prescription product and should never be used without dermatologist advice. Dermatologist commonly prescribes it for facial hyperpigmentation and melasma. However, it should never be used as a regular fairness cream and in any case, not for more than two to three months. Since the steroid content of this cream can cause various side effects like acne, photosensitivity, skin thinning, and telangiectasia and facial hair growth (hirsutism), which is especially troublesome in females. I would suggest that you use a broad-spectrum sunscreen throughout the day. At night you could use Glyco-A (glycolic acid cream) or Kojic (Kojic acid cream) to obtain the desired results of brighter complexion and even tone. You could also opt for a few peeling sessions from a dermatologist, e.g., yellow peel (Retinol CT peel) or glycolic peel or lactic acid peel."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

My gastroenterologist ran some tests and did an upper endoscopy as well as a HIDA scan. The upper turned out negative for all tests however the HIDA scan reported that my gallbladder was functioning at approximately 40%. My GI then recommended a cholecystectomy as my gallbladder was not functioning properly. He did also suggest that I could try to repair it with my diet but then told me it would likely be fruitless and I should get the procedure right away. I did so promptly and experienced the typical symptoms. I am concerned about this only now because I believe I have postcholecystectomy syndrome due to the surgery. This would not be an issue relatively however I believe that my rapid weightloss was due to extreme stress and was mostly psychological. It seems to me that my practitioner should have advised me that gallstones occur commonly when rapid weight loss occurs. Furthermore, I believe that I could have benefited much more from keeping my gallbladder on a rigorous healthy diet and prescribing a biliary control. The latter that has taken place has resulted in a year long constant struggle to be happy and healthy.","Doctor":"Hello. Well, I understand that a year back you have been diagnosed with gallbladder dyskinesia or dysmotility as reported by HIDA scan. I was wondering whether you have weight loss as the only primary symptom or associated with abdominal pain. Because gallbladder dyskinesia most commonly causes pain and diarrhea rather simply weight loss. Or one should have to have evidence that the weight loss was due to gallbladder dyskinesia and not otherwise, then surgery was probably the right decision. I cannot figure out whether you have other symptoms or not. And now what sort of typical symptoms you feel suggesting you as postcholecystectomy syndrome (PCS). I can understand actually that symptoms of PCS can be at times very distressing and unbearable. The common symptoms are bloating after meal, freqeunt reflux or pain in the upper part of the belly, diarrhea after meals or sometimes otherwise, and this even can cause weight loss. This syndrome basically occurs secondary to an excessive pool of bile stored within a small bowel instead of gallbladder which is otherwise a sole bile reservoir. But PCS usually resolves within some time the maximum it can take is two to three years until the time your small intestine is adapted to it. You can try tablet Cholestyramine 4 gm twice daily 1 hour before meal or 4 hours before meals. This is a bile sequestrant and will bind and remove excessive bile from the gut. To be honest, I still do not understand the reason for your surgery year back but cannot completely argue with physician because I was not and he was the best person to decide while understanding your condition at that time.

But, it did not, and last week I went to hospital and the doctor drained the boil with anesthesia, and then he closed it with stitches, now it is still hard and smells like pus. So my question is why he closed it with stitches? Is that ok? Because the incision was small (1 cm), should it be left open to completely drain? Can I still have abscess left? I asked the doctor and he is saying everything is fine. I am so scared, I would appreciate if anyone can help.","Doctor":"Hi. I totally agree with you. After draining a boil the doctor should have not closed the skin with stitches because how much ever adequately anybody drains the pus, some pus will be left behind for which anti-septic and antibiotic dressing has to be done and a repeat examination and if required drainage has to be done after 3 to 4 days. Well, there is a good chance that some pus might be remaining in your case, I advise you ask your doctor to open up the stitches and re-explore the wound."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, If a person is allergic to seafood, can they swim in the ocean? This person cannot touch seafood or have sea-salt either.","Doctor":"Hi. If a person is allergic to sea food and sea salt both, he should ideally avoid swimming in the ocean so as to avoid getting an attack of anaphylaxis (lethal allergic reaction) while under water. In my years of practice I have never come across any person with allergy to sea salt. It is usually the sea food which contains proteins, to which allergy occurs. Sea salt contains NaCl and KCl and other minerals which are usually inert and do not cause any reaction. However, to be on the safer side, avoid swimming if you are truly allergic to sea food and sea water."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Yesterday, I went hiking and was running down a cliff.

From your description I gather you have had a nasty fall on both your knees with one being more swollen than the other. You have not mentioned but I am assuming that you were able to stand and walk after the fall and did not need to be carried back. Also, assuming you are young and fit, you have not said anything about your age. The correct course of action will be to take an X-ray of the knee which had swollen up like a balloon. This is to be on the safer side. I will also recommend resting the knee till the swelling comes down enough to allow you to start bending it comfortably. Apply ice, put a compression dressing and take some anti-inflammatory medicines. If the knee shows no fracture on X-ray and you continue to have feeling of something not quite right, MRI will be required to rule out a ligamentous injury."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My child is suffering from loose motion and he is 1.5 years old.

You have not given vaccine is not the topic of discussion, no need to worry about this, diarrhea is common due to various causes. I need more information. Dysentary means blood in stool, if blood is there or not? Since what age he had diarrhea? What is the frequency? It is watery? Growth retardation? Worm in the stool?  Let's discuss about one by one.  1. If it is associated with blood in the stool, it could be infective diarrhea or IBD, for infection antibiotics are required, Ofloxacin 10mg/kg/dose BD for 10 days. IBD is required with detailed evaluation.  2. If it does not contain blood and started after age of 6 to 10 months, then it could be a disease known as celiac disease, it needs further simple investigation for conformation.  3. If worm is present in the stool, then it can cause diarrhea. No need to worry due to vaccination, there is something else that is causing diarrhea. It needs detailed evaluation.  Investigation.  1. Complete blood hemogram.  2. If diarrhea is longer, then get done serum tTGA.  3. Stool routine examination for 3 days.  Treatment:  1. If diarrhea is recent onset then, maintain hydration by giving ORS 100 ml/loose stool, monitor urine output. If it is more then 15 days then no need to give ORS.  2.Syrup Zinc-20 5 ml once a day for 30 days. These are the mainstay of treatment of acute diarrhea.  3. If blood is present, then give him Ofloxacin (5 ml=100 mg) 5 ml BD.  4. If worm is present then give him Syrup Nitazoxanide (5 ml=100 mg) 5 ml BD for 6 days. Report back to me with available possible reports and answer my queries, because your child needs evaluation otherwise his growth may be affected."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My brother is having the problem of not able to breathe properly. Now the doctor has planned to advise for tracheostomy. How long it should be in the neck? Will there be any complication?","Doctor":"Hi. See, tracheostomy is done if it is expected that the patient who is on ventilator may take more than 10 days to come out of ventilator. Now the duration till it will be there in neck depends on the cause for which tracheostomy has been done. If his primary disease improves, the doctors will do a trial of room air breathing by temporarily closing tracheostomy site but if primary disease is not improving then they will keep it as long as the disease does not improve. Complications include infections, bleeding, excessive secretion from airway may block the tracheostomy."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 7 months pregnant and my first pregnancy was a missed abortion. During this pregnancy, I underwent tests like thrombophilia profile and protein S antigen test in which my protein S levels were found low: 58% according to protein S antigen and 32.90% as per protein S functional test. The doctor has told me to take Heparin (Enoxaprin) injection daily of 40 mg throughout my pregnancy and six weeks after delivery. Kindly suggest.","Doctor":"Hi.  Based on your query, my opinion is as follows: 1. Protein S antigen levels are borderline, however the functional activity level is a bit low.  2. This increases the risk of clotting, which is always increased in pregnancy.  3. To reduce anticoagulants like Heparin is necessary. Ecosprin will reduce activity of platelet and hence both will be helpful. Do continue as prescribed. Watch out for any purpura or bleeding spots in skin. You can get a prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin time done to check the efficacy of heparin, if necessary."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 5 months 15 days old baby is having loose motion from yesterday and he has passed 8 to 9 times greenish motion.

Please give syrup Zincolife 2.5 ml once a day for 14 days. Also, give ORS solution (prepare solution as advised in the instructions given) as 10 ml/kg with the passage of each loose stool to keep the baby hydrated. It will take atleast 4 days for loose motions to be controlled after starting these medicines.  Watch for signs of dehydration like lethargy, refusal to feed, poor skin turgor, dry oral mucosa. If these signs are present it is indicative of dehydration. In such cases and also, if the child is passing blood in stools, it is advisable to admit the child to the nearest hospital after evaluation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a mild irregular cornea OD eye.

During this time, I not able to control myself and crying like anything. Sometimes it is making me so crazy and angry as well. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms like poor sleep, excessive crying, feeling angry, etc? Did they start after any stressful event? I can understand it can be difficult having these symptoms but with the right support you will get better. It looks like your poor sleep is related to your emotional disturbance. Helping you calm down will improve your sleep and overall emotional wellbeing. Share your feelings and thoughts with trusted family and friends. Talking to a trusted family member or friend can lower stress significantly. Exercise regularly as it is the best mood regulator. Even a brisk walk of 15 -20 minutes daily will restore your spirit and help to sleep better. Try relaxation activities like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation daily. Be kind towards yourself. Treat yourself like how you will treat a friend who is going through a difficult time. Avoid watching TV, electronic screens before bed time. It will worsen your sleep. If your depression issues are severe and persistent, consult a doctor for further assessment. Counseling therapy and sometimes medication may be needed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Recently I got an allergy profile. It reports allergy with onion and rajma. I quitted rajma. I am finding it difficult to quit onion. The onion profile value is 0.69. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. From your allergy report, it is obvious that you are allergic to onion. The value of 0.69 suggests mild allergy. Still, you can not guarantee that after exposure, a severe reaction can not occur. A positive allergy test indicates sensitization to an allergen but does not necessarily predict that a clinically relevant allergic reaction will occur. The best way to treat allergy is to avoid the trigger, but it is very difficult, especially in Indian recipes. First, find out if cooked onion causes less symptoms than the raw one because the allergic trigger is protein present in raw onion. So after cooking, it gets denatured and can not cause allergic symptoms.  Over counter tablets like Levocetirizine, Desloratadine, or Rupatadine will alleviate allergic symptoms like itching and redness. Antacids will help to relieve acidity, specially liquid antacids than tablets. So prevention is the key messege. Even if it is said that food does not contain onion, the flavouring agents, sauces or many toppings contain it and cause an allergic reaction. Even other food from the same family can sometimes cause allergy like garlic, carrot, etc. It is the matter of just trial and error as per your tolerance."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

First of all, I would like to tell you that Ludwig's angina is not associated with the infection of the upper wisdom tooth. It is associated with infection or pericoronitis of lower partially erupted wisdom tooth. So, if you are having pain in partially erupted lower tooth, then consult an oral surgeon for according advice. And it is good that you are taking care of your upper infected teeth by taking antibiotics and warm saltwater. But, this is not enough for this type of infection. You must consult your dentist to check the condition of the present infection and an x-ray investigation of the same tooth to rule out the spread of infection to the end of the root and for the needful treatment and also for antibiotics dosage.

I have not broken anything, but I dislocated my elbow three years ago, and I recently noticed my shoulder blade is pushed up. I can feel it is positioned high and clearly noticeable by viewing and comparing it to the other side. When I lift my arm, I can feel my tendon popping over the top of my shoulder blade, and there is a tingling sensation.","Doctor":"Hello. From what I understand, it seems that you may be having a winging scapula. The cause of winging is a weakness in your serratus anterior muscle due to nerve injury. This is quite possible in contact sports with recurrent stretch as you tilt your head the other way, and the shoulder is pushed down when tackling. It can also be due to compression of the nerve from trauma to the side of your chest. This is most often a partial injury to the nerve and is likely to recover with time. It may, however, be a slow recovery taking up to six months. Another possibility may be an old fracture of the scapula (shoulder blade). The fracture may have healed with some bumpiness and may cause the popping sound as it moves. Do you remember any recent trauma to your shoulder blade? It may be prudent to have it evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon. While your description matches that of a winging scapula, it may rarely be something else. I hope this helps. Old scapular fracture. Winging scapula. Consult an orthopedic surgeon, wait and watch if it is truly a winging scapula."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have got an egg allergy. I mistakenly ate a cake which contains egg in it. I am having severe stomach pain. What can be done in such a situation? Please suggest any medicine.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. First, let me clear you that in case of any food or skin allergy, avoidance is the best treatment option. But many times, it is not possible to do so when our food contains some hidden allergens, which cause allergy symptoms, as you said. Egg protein is the complete protein, and it is very difficult to avoid it, especially in the bakery items, ice-cream, and fast food like meatballs and meatloaf.  Egg allergy can be due to egg white protein or egg yolk proteins. And it is very difficult to separate the yolk from the egg white. So you should strictly avoid both of them.  You can use egg substitutes in various recipes. Consult your dietician.  The allergy symptoms can be gastrointestinal, respiratory, or pertaining to the skin like itching.  For treatment, the most important thing is to avoid eggs.  For itching, you can take Levocetirizine 5 mg one at night as required.  For stomach pain, nausea, or vomiting, I suggest taking Cyclopam (Dicyclomine and Paracetamol) twice daily for three days and Sompraz-D (Domperidone and Esomeprazole) one in the morning for ten days. I hope this helps. Egg protein allergy. Skin prick allergy test or Blood allergy test. Food allergy.

She often hurts herself cutting her hands with a razor. She also shows indifference towards any advice she gets. She only does what she wants despite talking to her multiple times. Her father had passed away six years ago. She had been very tactful and hardworking in school even after the death of his father for two or three years. But now she changed totally. Her adolescence seems to go much farther than usual. The biggest problem now is that she does not care about any talk or warnings. She cuts her hands aggressively from time to time especially when her mom blames her for something she does. Her school grades and desire to learn had decreased. I would be grateful to know if we need to consult a psychiatrist or do something else.","Doctor":"Hello. I think your daughter is struggling emotionally and is using self-harm as a maladaptive coping mechanism to deal with her difficult situation. You are reporting that her performance at school has deteriorated in the past two to three years, and she is not able to take on board the family's advice. Minor self-harming behavior is relatively common in teenagers, but significant self -harm happens in children exposed to adverse life events and struggling to manage their life's stressors. How is she getting on with friends at school? Is her eating habits healthy? Is she sleeping well? Is she able to enjoy anything? Does she express thoughts like being fed up with life? As a parent, do you have any lighter moments with your daughter? Are all interactions leading to conflict? Suggestions: Your daughter will need understanding and support to get over this difficult period. It can be stressful and frustrating for parents to deal with this situation. Try to be calm and avoid excessive criticism as it can be counter-productive. Consult a psychiatrist in your city for a comprehensive assessment of her mental state. Some young people who self-harm may have conditions like depression, emotional dysregulation, or emerging personality difficulties, which need to be clarified and supported accordingly. Your daughter will benefit from psychological therapy to help her manage her emotions and develop safer and positive coping strategies to deal with her distress. Sometimes medication will be needed as well. It will take time and support to stop self -harming behavior gradually."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My mother is 58 years old. Her periods stopped in 2015.

All test came positive and nothing seen in ultrasound. No infection and no fibroids also. Please guide.","Doctor":"Hello. Blood mixed vaginal fluid in the postmenopausal women need to be evaluated cautiously and carefully. Although the common cause of such bleeding is due to deficiency of hormones once menopause is achieved, the possibility of cervical and endometrial cancer needs to be ruled out. Ultrasound will not detect anything abnormal if the condition is still in an early stage, for which microscopic evaluation of the cells needs to be done to see for any cancerous changes. Rarely, the bleeding can be from the urinary tract or from the rectum which could be mistaken as vaginal bleeding too. You need to get her a pap smear and HPV (human papilloma test) testing done along with endometriosis evaluation to rule out both cervical and endometrial cancer possibility. If possible, please share her ultrasound reports to look for her endometrial thickness value. Please do not ignore these tests, if not done previously. I am assuming by getting her evaluated, you have already gotten her examination done with a gynecologist, if not then please make a visit to your gynecologist for her examination.

Later after a few months, when he coughed the color of the sputum was dark red. Again some blood was coming with the sputum. The doctors said that it was not because of the cirrhosis. But, now his weight gain and belly fat is also increasing. And nowadays, he coughs more. Can you please tell me some tips to take care of his health.","Doctor":"Hi. First of all, when he had coughed before, and he was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis, that is because of gastric varices which he might had developed, and now as you were saying that doctor has said he does not have blood due to cirrhosis, that means he has developed some other pathology. For proper diet plan and his treatment, first I would suggest that you should do one ultrasound of liver that is called fibroscan, get it done and send me the reports. Secondly, you need to get his endoscopy done again and one digital chest X-ray. Once these reports are done, send it to me all the reports along with your query. You must stop all oily food, must keep checking his sugar levels. He should not develop diabetes and if he will then stop his sugar intake, give him more soups and boiled food items only, always avoid raw food like salads and stuff.

Can you suggest me the tablets which work best as I have to give presentation after some days in my class. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. You are reporting a relapse of some social anxiety symptoms after discontinuation of Paroxetine SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) medication. Depending on the extent of your social anxiety symptoms, you have two options: 1) If anxiety is predominantly situational (like giving a presentation in a class and other social interactions), then just taking Inderal (Propranolol) 40 mg once daily as needed should be helpful. Check with your doctor about not having any contra-indications before taking propranolol. 2) If anxiety is pervasive and not allowing you to function normally, you can try other SSRI like Sertraline. SSRIs are one of the safest medications to manage long term anxiety. Did you have any CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) for managing social anxiety? They are very effective. CBT will lessen the need for medication and will help to prevent relapse. Consult a psychologist in your city for CBT.

On the 30th day appointment she had weight 4 kg, length 56 cm, and head circumference 38 cm. 60th day appointment: weight 4.75 kg, length: 57 cm, and head circumference 40 cm. 90th day appointment, weight 5.58 kg, length 61 cm, head circumference 41 cm. Since then she did not gain any weight for two weeks, so we started giving also Formula, without much success, she barely drinks 120 ml for one meal. Her weight gain has not been good since, on the 120th day appointment, she was 5.91 kg. How can I make her drink more at each meal? Would my baby be described as failure to thrive? What are the long-term effects of this slow weight gain pattern?","Doctor":"Hello.  The weight of your baby is slightly less. See it is not about the quantity, it is about the frequency of the feeds and the calorie content of each feed.  1. Feeding should be done every two hourly. Even at night.  2. Fortification of the milk can be done by using Simyl MCT oil and HMF sachet in each feed. In food fortification, the quantity of each feed remains same but the calorie content increases. I hope this helps your baby gain weight. Weight should double birth weight by 6 months, triple by 1 year, and be 4 times by 2 years."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been diagnosed with OCD. My OCD comes in the form of intense fear of sleep for the past five years, but it has gotten worse within the past couple of months. I am afraid the moment sleep comes, I fight this feeling until I am exhausted. How can I make peace with falling asleep and not associate it with fear and something to avoid? I am currently taking Gabapentin 600 mg, Seroquel 100 mg, and Clomipramine 25 mg. I have been on SSRI approximately 20 years back, for anxiety and depression. As I am prone to panic attacks, I have done tests to rule out any heart problem, lung problem or any other physical cause.","Doctor":"Hello. I will start with the pharmacological part. You can discuss with your treating doctor regarding increasing the dose of Clomipramine, not only will it help with sleep but also in decreasing the obsessions. You can also discuss regarding substituting it with Fluvoxamine if not given a trial yet. Now a few points regarding non-pharmacological methods that can help with OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) are as follows. I know it is easier said than done but try to accept your obsession, but not the fear or anxiety associated with it. Logging down your obsessions sometimes helps relieve the associated anxiety.

During first time sex with her, I was not able to insert my penis into her vagina. Her vagina is in closed very tight condition. I tried to insert my fingers also but could not make it. Even I tried foreplay. Can you tell me the solution for it?","Doctor":"Hi. It is really frustrating for a young married man and the couple to not be able to consummate the marriage and have satisfying sex. There are a few possibilities you might consider in your case. Vaginismus is a condition in which there is an involuntary spasm of pelvic muscles which make penetration almost impossible. It can be treated by relaxing the woman, supporting her emotionally and starting the sexual act by using a very thin dilator during foreplay. You need to keep on increasing the dilator thickness or may use your fingers until the spasmodic contraction of pelvic muscles is gone. Then you may start penetrating with your penis with lots of lubricants. Reassuring the partner and involving her fully in the effort is the key. Look for any structural defect in the vagina if any. Sometimes, even normal women have a very small aperture or opening due to the thick and intact hymen. just try with lots of lubrication and loads of foreplay."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, This is regarding a syphilis test RPR ratio.","Doctor":"Hello.

I am currently on Sepia 200. Kindly help.","Doctor":"Hello. Before we could determine the exact cause for this prolonged bleeding, I would like to know a little more details about your previous cycles. As you said you always had regular cycles, just wanted to know if your previous period was on time and had a normal pattern of bleeding or was it scanty. Also, whether you are a sexually active individual, and if so whether any chances of pregnancy could be there? If there is any such doubt, it would be advisable to take a home pregnancy test. Sometimes the scanty flow of implantation hemorrhage could be confused with a normal period and the actual bleeding could be a sign of threatened miscarriage. If pregnancy is ruled out (by checking urine pregnancy test or if not sexually active), the hormonal disturbances of thyroid or prolactin hormones, and sometimes lifestyle-related problem that is PCOS also can cause such irregularities in periods. Also, stress can be one of the reason for hormonal changes and thus causing disturbances in menstrual patterns. Basically, this is suggestive of anovulatory cycles. So to find out these, you need to take certain blood tests. I would like to know if you had any recent weight loss, or do you face frequent acne and unwanted facial hair growth problems, any headaches or visual problems? These symptoms may provide some clues to the underlying problem which is causing a delay in periods for you.

I think it looks okay for the most part but the thing that bothers me is this small gap in the bottom half of my front teeth.

She said she cannot do anything about it, but I am very unhappy with the way it looks when I talk, laugh, etc. I researched about this kind of gaps, but most people report having gaps between the top of the two front teeth and not in the bottom like me.

I have been suffering from a migraine for over five to six years or more. I have been sensitive to light since childhood. I used to take Migranil initially. Around two years ago, I met a neurologist and he advised me Amitone at night and Naxdom 500 in case of emergency (at the onset of a headache). It had given me a substantial relief but then I had to take Naxdom almost every other day. I have been trying to taper off but have been unsuccessful. I still have to take Naxdom 500 every three days (on average) else I just cannot carry on with my day. I do not take Amitone anymore as it had started making me extremely sleepy in the morning and working hours as well. When I have a migraine:  I suffer from a throbbing pain usually emerging from the left side of the head and it keeps spreading. The pain grows into nausea and vomiting sensations. High intolerance to light (sunlight feels impossible to tolerate), sound, any distinct smell, non-cotton clothes. I am not able to handle even minor stress somehow which definitely does not feel normal. Naxdom is the only medicine that helps in such a case but how long can I keep depending on such painkillers? I had suddenly gained weight and had developed hypothyroidism in between. Can these medications be a culprit?  Also, I want to know all the possible side-effects of Naxdom and Amitone, please. Kindly note, I have hypothyroidism as well. I have recently gone through a miscarriage and will be trying for pregnancy soon in approximately three to four months. But, at least for a month or so I want to get rid of my migraine issues. When I was pregnant, my doctor had said if it feels absolutely necessary I can take Naxdom at times. I had it only twice though during my pregnancy. What is the prescribed dosage of Naxdom during pregnancy in such an inevitable case? Also, please note even without a migraine attack, am generally very very prone to nausea and exhaustion since years (when it is hot, when I am stressed, long working hours or just for no plausible reason). What safe medications can I take to get rid of these nauseous feeling and vomiting tendencies and any tests I should get done? All these factors have been affecting the quality of life adversely and I do not feel these are normal symptoms as I have tried multiple solutions so far.","Doctor":"Hi. Your symptoms are classically suggestive of a migraine only. Now, migraine can be well controlled with medicines and lifestyle changes. My choice remains Amitone (Amitryptiline) along with Flunarizine. Side effect profile of Amitone contains mostly sedation and weight gain. Otherwise, it is safe to take. Naxdom is a painkiller and should be taken in only severe headaches. Now, point is that you want to conceive now, so in pregnancy, we usually advise our patients to take Paracetamol for headaches. A lot of people get their migraine resolved during the pregnancy period. However, in cases where we need to give medicines, the recommended drug is Propanolol, which is relatively safe in pregnancy. So, if you wish to start treatment, then discuss with your doctor to start you on Propanolol. This drug can be continued even if you conceive.

Mirtazapine is not the most efficient ant depressant and it is not a true SSRI as fluoxetine, paroxetine, citalopram and sertraline are. I recommend 20 to 40mg of Paroxetine (slowly titrated up from 10mg) and 1mg of either clonazepam or ativan (lorazepam) every 8 hours as needed for anxiety.

It is not very clear from your mail what exactly you mean by \\"hard breath\\". I consider it \\"difficulty in breathing\\" and my answer is based on difficulty in breathing. Difficulty in breathing is a non-specific symptom and can be due to a wide variety of reasons. As the symptom is related to lungs, my explanation is based on that. So, if your symptoms are due to a problem with the lungs, then you can follow these guidelines for yoga: Useful pranayama (breathing exercise) are Anuloma viloma (27 rounds), sectional breathing (5 breaths each), bhramari (9 rounds) and kapalbhati. Useful asanas (yoga poses) are basically chest openers like bhujangasana, ardhachakrasana, matsyasana, ustrasana, vakrasana, ardhamatsyendrasana,simple inverted postures like sarvangasana, and ardhasirsasana. Complementary postures needed to be followed are a mandatory part of yoga practices. Each asana is to be maintained for five normal breaths. All the practices should be done slowly. Kapalbhati has to be started at a slow pace and then gradually increase the pace. If your disease is stable, then start at 30 strokes/minute. Meditation and chanting are especially beneficial for allergic bronchitis and asthma patients. Start yoga practices under supervision. No yoga session is successful without yogic understanding and yogic counseling. Start with these yoga practices for one hour per day.

Please do not worry as it can easily be managed. The best part of it is that there is no pain or itching in it.  It is caused by either fungi or due to the fungal growth.

Apply Hydrozole (Hydrocortisone and Clotrimazole) cream and Triple antibiotic cream (Bacitracin zinc, Neomycin sulphate and Polymyxin B sulphate) on the lesion twice daily. 1. Take plenty of clean drinking water. 2. Keep a balanced and healthy diet to help improve your immunity as such problems also originate when we have a low immunity. 3. Keep the genitals properly washed and make the undershave timely. Long hair cause skin problem in the genital areas and axilla. 4. Pull the foreskin backwards and wash the area with water after every urination. Then wipe it dry with a clean paper towel. Make it a habit.

It got really bad last week and I went to a doctor. They did an ultrasound and found several hyperechoic nodular foci on the liver. He said this could simply represent hemangiomas but could be mucinous metastases. I started panicking as I have always had bad health anxiety. I went to get a CT scan and could not do a contrast so found well defined \\"mildly hypodense mass\\" measuring 44.6x32.9 mm. I started to get really bad - not sleeping, not eating, losing weight, bad headaches, ringing in ears, muscle twitches, shaking, etc. They scheduled me for biopsy and when I got there the surgeon said they pulled up my old CT from six years ago and the mass had not changed. So, it was most likely hemangioma and not going to do a biopsy.I still kept on the downward spiral as I did not believe them. I was told an MRI with contrast was the best test for liver lesions so I paid and had that done. Also had a brain MRI done because I thought I definitely had stage 4 cancer. All of this was one year back. MRI showed multiple liver lesions with largest 30.5x23.9 mm. T2 hyperintense and several others. All identified as behaving as hemangiomas and simple cysts. Not being satisfied with that I had a colonoscopy and upper endoscopy done. Both alright. Decided to go to liver specialist and they did another MRI with 9 cc Multihance. Findings were all clear except liver with \\"multiple lobulated T2 hyperintense hepatic lesions\\" largest being 3.1x2.5 mm. All consitent with hemangiomas. \\"No suspicious hepatic lesions\\".The specialist also told me if I had stage 4 I would be in very bad shape with no treatment. I started back working out and put all my weight back on up to 200 lbs and feeling better except same pain in right side rib area every day. Got another six month follow up MRI last month and nothing had changed. Last week, I started having pain again in right rib area and started internet searching again and finding most hemangiomas are single not multiple and most metastases are multiple, which mine are. Also that hemangiomas are mostly in women not men. So now I am back to not sleeping, not eating, and feeling like I have some type of stage 4 cancer. Never had any cancer diagnosis though and none in my family. Eat good, worked out twice a day, only drink water, maintain a healthy weight. Even though I know in almost a year and a half with no treatment and stage 4 I would be bad shape or actually dead as the average lifespan of stage 4 metastases without treatment is 8.7 years, but I do not really believe that because they are not oncologists. I looked up and saw that NET's could be slow-growing cancers and maybe I have that. I just need an independent second opinion on what could cause right side pain besides what is showing up in all the tests I have had done. Also if having three MRI's with contrast saying the same thing is specific enough to rule out liver metastases. Online it shows MRI with contrast has a 97 % specificity when done one time so is three times even better to rule it out? Why would a male in great shape otherwise develop hemangiomas throughout the liver? Would a PET scan be better than MRI at this point? Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello. Do not worry and do not panic. All your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) are pointing towards hemangiomas. It is easy to differentiate between cancer and hemagioma by a radiologist on CT scan, MRI, or ultrasound. Your reports are clearly indicating cystic lesions (hemangiomas). If these liver lesions were cancerous, usually they will be symptomatic - progressive weight loss, poor appetite, jaundice and deranged liver function tests, sometimes dark urine, etc. Any cancerous liver lesion will progressively increase in size. Even slow-growing metastatic neuroendocrine in liver is usually stage 4 neuroendocrine tumor. Your blood report is showing normal liver parameters, CT scan/MRI showing cystic/hemangiomas in liver. Any radiologist can easily differentiate between hemangioma and metastasis. So, your radiologist has mentioned clearly benign cystic lesions. Also, you have no weight loss, poor appetite, and your liver parameters in blood test are normal. Also, colonoscopy and gastroscopies are normal (there was no need to go for endoscopy). So, relax and do not worry at all. But keep following up with the hepatologist for these hemangiomas. Internet search information will confuse you. If any questions, contact me for free for one more time in the next few days.

Does he have chest tightness or shortness of breath or wheezing during the episode? Any seasonal variation or exacerbation in winters? Asthma is due to hyper airway responsiveness to air borne allergens. Treatment includes: prevention of the episodes and management of acute asthma. Identifying and avoiding the allergen remains the mainstay. Inhaled corticosteroids control the hyper airway responsiveness and control the occurrence of episodes. Asthalin and nebulization remain the treatment for acute episodes. As I have told you, for any allergic diseases, avoidance of the merger is what should be done and followed.

For about five years, I have been on a variety of Benzodiazepines. Right now, I am on 2 mg Xanax four times a day. It is better than nothing, but I have built up such tolerance benzodiazepines hardly work for me. I know the only way to lower that tolerance is to go without benzodiazepines for a while. However, I do need something for my anxiety. The only thing I can think of is Barbiturates, which I know are similar to Benzodiazepines but are no longer medically common. Are there any alternatives or advice?","Doctor":"Hello. As you rightly commented, Xanax and other Benzodiazepines are not helpful in the long term management of anxiety as they cause dependence. You become tolerant, and they do not work. At best, Benzos can be used sparingly for the short term only. Barbiturates are no longer indicated in this situation. If you are continuing to have severe anxiety and PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), medication like SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) will be a much better choice for long term management. Also, psychological therapy like CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) and EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) will be effective in managing your symptoms. Following a psychiatric review, your doctor will be able to advise you of appropriate options. Also, it is important that you do not stop Benzodiazepines suddenly after taking high doses for a long period. You need to taper down gradually with medical advice to minimize unsafe withdrawal effects. I will advise you to consult your doctor for support in tapering Xanax and to consider other treatment options for your condition. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 26 year old male.

Please suggest some medicines.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query. Your problem may have many reasons. First of all, I saw your BMI. You have a higher BMI than normal. BMI should be between 18.9 - 24.5. So, first of all, try to decrease your weight. Sometimes overweight hinders sexual activity. Do regular exercises. Exercise will help to reduce your weight, and it will increase the blood supply of your body organs, and it will also improve the erection of your penis. Another important thing is diet. At your age your body might need some more energy than a younger man. Add milk to your diet. Milk helps in improving semen quality. Add fresh fruits and fresh vegetables to your diet too. Ayurvedic text favors mash dhal in improving sperm quality, so try to take this dhal twice or thrice a week. And whatever you take, take in a proportional value and eat healthy food. Sleep for six to eight hours daily. Sleep helps to overcome the wear and tear of your body. Quit smoking and drinking if you do because both these thing affects your sexual activity. Use Himcolin gel (Himalaya). Apply this gel in adequate quantity on the penis and pubic region with a gentle massage before sexual intercourse. Avoid using on glans penis. This gel will help you in the erection process. Take Makardhwaj Rasayan tablet one tablet twice a day with milk for two to three weeks only. Take Tentex royal capsule (Himalaya) two capsules once daily one hour before sexual intercourse for six to eight weeks. Take at least six weeks for satisfactory results. Age or lack of proper diet or some drug abuse. Semen examination. After one month."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

The pain will be there for first three to four days, and the wound will appear like yellowish-white color. It is normal, so do not touch the area at all and avoid brushing in the area also. If the pain persists even after five days, then it means you may have a dry socket condition which is caused by dislodging of the blood clot. You need to use warm saline gargle as much as possible.

There are many hidden intra-abdominal pouches that may collect some fluids and remain in the abdominal cavity even after the operation. Some surgeons may put an intra-abdominal drain to drain any remaining fluids, while others are satisfied with good suction.

A couple of months ago, I was diagnosed with a bulging disc in C6 and C7. I had pain and weakness associated with such a problem, and after some treatment, the pain subsided.

She is feeling a labor pain, but the doctor told that it is not labor pain, and she will not deliver now and wait for 15 days. Doctor gave Anafortan injection to reduce the pain. Is that safe? We are worried as some people suggested that Anafortan should not be given. Please help. We did an ultrasound scan and blood test, her hemoglobin level is 10.1.","Doctor":"Hello. As this is the first pregnancy, I would like to give a few general information. Now, after completion of the eighth month, there are mainly two types of pain which a female is going to perceive. 1) False labor pain and 2) Backache due to pregnancy itself. False labor pain: As pregnancy comes near the due date, the uterus starts paining. But there is no effect in the view of delivery. The pain is perceived by a woman but there is no opening of the mouth of uterus. The baby is fine and the doctor cannot get contration on seeing the abdomen. This type of pain followed by delivery pain in 10 to 15 days or more in the first pregnancy, and less than 10 days in 2nd or 3rd pregnancy. So you do not have to worry much about this pain as far as it is tolerable. As pregnancy advances due to the increased size of uterus and baby, which takes a space in the abdomen and compresses the spinal cord causig the pain. It is continuous in nature and will be relieved only after delivery. For this type of pain, sometimes we advise painkiller gel or tablet if it is not tolerable. You can also do a hot compress on the back. As far as Anafortan (combination of Camylofin and Paracetamol) is concerned, we avoid it as far as possible. But when it comes to one or two times, it is not harmful. When you are taking this drug continuously, especially in the ninth month, then only it is harmful. So you can take Anafortan (non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) once or twice if the pain is more and if it is not delivery pain. So do not worry with one injection. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have two problems. One is with my breasts. I have lumps in my breasts, and the nipples curve inward sometimes. They are sensitive to touch. I need to know if this could be breast cancer or just a growth. My other problem is my vagina. I have been having problems for over a month. I am having severe cramps that feel like the cramps I used to get on my period. My birth control pills eliminate the pain during my cycle, in the lower abdomen. It is sensitive to the touch. About one and a half months ago, I got treatment for yeast infection and now taking probiotics. I still have the itch, so they gave me more yeast pills, that has gone away. I also notice a loss in my weight and appetite. I do not feel hungry most of the time and feel full. I am getting sick in the night or in the morning, where I feel like vomiting. My stomach hurts a lot. I am very tired a lot more than normal.","Doctor":"Hello. You said that your breast has a lump. If the lump is central and your areola is bulging out than a normal developing breast with a solid and hard lump, then you should consult a doctor. Increased sensitivity is also because of your age. Secondly, vaginal itching and discharge, if any, then you have to take treatment for that. It will be recurring if you are not maintaining proper hygiene. Drink more water so that your urine has very few bacteria and less chance of infection. Change your underwear more frequently during your periods. If possible, use cotton underwear, change more pads during your periods. Do not use an antiseptic solution near your vaginal area as it also cleans the normal bacteria which is required. Continue your medicines as per now and follow these measures, and you will have less chance of getting an infection. Thirdly as your age increases, you are going to have a wide variety of emotional changes. Some of them are good and some you may not like but will find a way as time passes. So do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Six months ago, my father was hospitalized due to pleural effusion. After doing all the tests, we got to know that he has cardiomyopathy, for which the doctor prescribed some medicines. He is taking Atorfit CV 20, Nitrocontin 2.6 mg, Coversyl plus, Concor 2.5, Glyciphage and Glynase. But recently almost every night at the time of sleeping his both chest and back burns and pains. We did a chest x-ray, echocardiography, blood test and ECG. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. Did he undergo angiography at that time? Can you attach his test reports or summary? Firstly, you should consult your cardiologist again and get him checked for the cause of pain. This pain may be related to noncardiac cause as well, like musculoskeletal or gastric reflux. Does he also get pain on exertion or activities which relieve at rest? If yes, then it could be related to the heart. In that case, he will need angiography, and some medicines to be added. There is no antacid medicine mentioned here. So you should discuss regarding starting antacids like tablets Pan-DSR (Pantoprazole and Domperidone) before breakfast once daily. He should avoid having oily, spicy foods and heavy meals, especially at night. So it is important to visit your cardiologist and get him examined and modify some medicines, especially antacids. Also, discuss the need for angiography and adding cardiac medicines. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 66-year-old male with a weight of 90 kg and a height of 175 cms. For the last four months, I am continuously facing the following problems. Moderate sore throat, feeling like a lump in my deep throat, gastric reflux, poor digestion, a feeling of air blocked in both the ears and popping sound on swallowing. After treatment, these symptoms subside for some time. But now I have deviated septum. Presently I have sticky mucus discharge from the nose in postnasal mode. Sometimes I also feel stress in the jaws. Due to continuous popping in ears (mostly left ear) and lump feeling in the throat, I am unable to sleep properly. This is having an adverse effect on my health. I am on medication for almost three months on and off, including Levocetirizine one tablet twice daily and Fluticasone spray. I also take Rabeprazole DSR for the reflux issue, steam inhalation, and saline gargles. But symptoms sometimes abate and again come up. I regularly take Bisoprolol and Metformin and glimperamide for few years. Due to soreness in the throat, popping in the ears, and continuous cough, I am unable to sleep. The sticky mucus is viscous and salty in taste and discharges in the throat. RTF test showed partial dysfunction of the left eustachian tube. What could be the likely causes and line of treatment to get rid of this? Could it be due to air pollution or some other allergy source? Due to continuous coughing, my abdominal muscles are paining, and there is a split voice in my throat. It appears like there is an overproduction of mucus all over the respiratory tract. I have started taking antibiotic Augmentin eight hours once for the last four days, but no relief. Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello.

Please suggest to me how to get rid of spectacles?","Doctor":"Hello. As you grow in height and built, similarly, your eye size changes, so as your glass number. Usually myopia (minus number) starts at 7-8 years of age and keep on changing till 20-22 years. Your glasses number is small. Keep using glasses and visit your doctor once in six months or once in a year for any change in glasses. Once the number stops changing and get stable, then you can get rid of glasses with Laser surgery, that is very simple. But for that you number should be stable and should not be changing.

Sometimes it can only be fixed when I put pressure on one side, but other times it hurts to put pressure on it. It started off with slight pains in either side, but now it has spread to both the sides, and now to the front of my pelvis, where the femur connects. It hurts when I stand, when I twist my leg, and when I lie down I am not comfortable. Sometimes when I make sudden movements, the pain is excruciating. Sometimes it will feel sightly better if I crack one of those joints somehow. What could it be and how can I fix it? And additional that I have to include is, this pain may persists for two to five days, then stops for about a week.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. These symptoms that you describe can be due to the following: 1. Bursitis: which your doctor says there is a gland that is inflamed. Bursitis may occur occasionally but, if not taken care of, may last for months. In such a case, complete bed rest for a few days, along with Voltaren (Diclofenac), would help for sure. It is a self-limiting disease. 2. This could be the initial phase of arthritis, as your mother also suffered the same. In either case, anti-inflammatory drugs are the first choice of drugs which is being given to you. However, it is important that you investigate with x-ray hip and blood reports like CBC (complete blood count), CRP (c-reactive protein) to rule out any other issues. If anti-inflammatory drugs do not work then, DMARD (disease modifying antirheumatic drugs) drugs followed by monoclonal antibodies."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 29 years old, mother of two healthy children, and pregnant for the third time. My LMP was 13th of last month and had only had intercourse only twice in the last three months. In the last month, I had intercourse only once before three to four weeks before having a positive pregnancy test and then a day or two after getting the positive test. I have a retroverted uterus. At an ultrasound, at 9 weeks, I was showing signs of being only 5 weeks pregnant with a gestational sac and yolk sac. At a follow-up ultrasound, one week later, the ultrasound technician thought maybe it was a molar pregnancy. There is now a fetal pole and one small ball-like shape but not any visible growth of the gestational sac. My HCG levels went from roughly from 69000 to 65500 in 48 hours. At the third ultrasound, a week after that showed the gestational sac, yolk sac, and what looked to me like two balls inside the gestational sac. My HCG levels are still going down. I was told it is a miscarriage but have had no signs other then the ultrasound saying it is a miscarriage, so I am reluctant to agree to any further action at this point. There has been no heartbeat yet, although the third ultrasound did come to a lot closer to almost finding one, but it was likely just my heartbeat, according to the technician. I need a second opinion as I am now only eight weeks and viable it would mean I miscarried the first and got pregnant immediately or I have two pregnancies going on at once. Both are very rare, or it is, in fact, a miscarriage? Also could high progesterone levels be masking the miscarriage? We have not tested yet since HCG levels are decreasing slowly already. What is stopping the contractions from happening?","Doctor":"Hello. By your history, it is a missed abortion and not miscarriage. And it is just a single pregnancy only.  Let me explain in detail. Normally pregnancy increases along with an increasing level of BhCG (beta chorionic gonadotropin). If HCG levels are decreasing, that means the pregnancy is not increasing, and instead, the further process started. In Sonography, firstly, one sac is seen around four weeks. After that, fetal pole and yolk sac are seen around the fifth week. At this time in Sonography, two sac-like structures are seen, which is normal. During the sixth week, cardiac activity starts in fetal pole, up to 12 weeks baby is ready with almost all organs prepared and then increasing in size and function in the rest of pregnancy. If your Sonography says 5 weeks at 9 weeks, it can be normal or abnormal both. I have explained that. If pregnancy shows 6 weeks at 10 weeks or 7 weeks at 11 weeks, then it is normal, and your pregnancy was delayed but now growing well. But when it shows 5 weeks at 10 weeks, 5 1/2 weeks at 11 weeks, or no cardiac activity and just increasing the sac size only then it is not normal and pregnancy is not having good enough growth or not growing at all. Now once if pregnancy has a problem, then there are some ways your body reacts. 1) The uterus starts contraction and bleeding starts, and there may be complete abortion or incomplete abortion according to whether everything comes out or not with contractions. 2) The uterus does not react, and pregnancy remains as such, in that case, it is called missed abortion. (means abortion should happen, but it is just missed due to some reason), further, there may bleed at a later time, or sac may organize in the uterus and make mole. And can have some other complications. So in this condition, we advise cleaning of uterus directly for sucking out the sac from the vagina with a suction machine (called suction and evacuation). So the best option for you is, stop taking even medication and get done with suction and evacuation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have pain in the bones, joints of hands and feet especially in the morning upon waking up.

I do not prefer metal braces because I do not want people to know I am wearing one. My wisdom teeth are growing on all four parts, which scares me terribly. Sometimes, I have swelling on my gums, and I think it is because of this.","Doctor":"Hello. I gone through your query, attached photographs, and understood your concern regarding dental health. First of all, in such overcrowding conditions of teeth, the wearing of braces is essential, even after the removal of a tooth to keep the other teeth in their correct position and to correct the rotation of adjacent teeth. Wearing braces is very common at this age, and different types of them are also available for better esthetics so that you can choose from them according to your needs. So for this, consult an Orthodontist for further treatment. And the swelling of gums around the wisdom tooth is very common during the eruption of the same tooth. You can go for removal of them one by one as there is no role of wisdom teeth in chewing function. I hope this helps.

However, I have one nostril bigger than the other, and my nose looks bent at the top. It has been like this since around age 15. What could cause this?

The general appearance of the nose happens to change from the beginning until the age of 18 after which it more or less remains constant unless and until there has been an external source of injury to deform the nose. If you feel that your nose looks way too weird, and it is way bothering you too much, you might require a corrective surgery that we call as a rhinoplasty. Now, depending on whether the area in concern has to be reduced or augmented, it depends on what type of nose job you want to get done and the surgeon will operate accordingly. Rhinoplasty is preserved for patients who know what changes they really have in mind and understand that a near close picture can be attained through surgery. Most nose job surgeons these days do have software wherein you can assess whats the abnormality in the nasal appearance, what changes you want and how would it probably look after the surgery. All the abnormalities mentioned above can be effectively resolved through operative rhinoplasty and conservative techniques do not really fetch long term results."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, After I had sex for the first time, there is a piece of skin on the side of the penis.

I am a 42-year-old woman, slightly overweight, moderately active and have anxiety, depression, and fatigue. I took Ashwagandha for a month when I was off Prozac and it seemed to help with my anxiety. When I upped my dose, I started getting bad stomach pain, got worried, and stopped. I have heard that those taking SSRIs and Benzodiazepines, like I am, should not take Ashwagandha. That it can cause serotonin syndrome and/or make a Benzodiazepine user sleepy. I have also heard it can ramp up the body's immune response. That worries me a bit too as I am super sensitive. The more I am taking anything, whether it be vitamins, fish oil, etc, the worse I feel. I went to a naturopathic doctor who prescribed me a lot of supplements and I think my body tried to detox too fast or something because it caused me to get sick and shaky. She did not understand why. I just know that too much of anything can overwhelm my system. Your advice is much appreciated. I did a saliva test a few years ago that showed high cortisol in the evening and night.","Doctor":"Hi. As you mentioned, Ashwagandha has health benefits, especially in anxiety. If the herb root is available in raw powder form, then it could be 1 g or 1.5 g. If it is in the extract form, then the therapeutic dose must be 200 to 300 mg. More than that, it is going to cause gastric irritation, that leads to stomach pain in your case. So, the powder or extract in the therapeutic dosage could be consumed along with a cup of milk or honey and warm water to reduce gastric irritation. Honey is safer in gastritis than milk. The herb has been proven to interact with many other drugs, the interaction with SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) or Benzodiazepines are not proven scientifically. The news available in this regard in social media are not authentic. So, the herb can be combined with SSRI or Benzodiazepines. It is true that the herb boosts the immunity. But, no scientific research has proven it as a threaten herb in super sensitive patients. Much preclinical basic research has proven that this herb boosts the essential T- immunity cells and will not affect the sensitized immune cells. This is called as an immunomodulatory effect. This herb is popular for having immunomodulatory effect. In your case, this herb will not aggravate the immune sensitivity. So, you can continue to take Ashwagandha herb with honey and warm water or milk.

I understand that as a doctor and fellow senior you would understand the amount of social and economic pressure we are in. I was a good and a bright student. My success and fame came easy in school and entrance. Till now I have not faced failure. But, the fear of failure always haunted me and spurred me to perform. Since I have gone to medical college, I have dropped out of my focus. I cannot focus on studies or any important work. I know that I am wasting time, but I cannot stop procrastinating. I just push deadlines and always worry about the result. I always go to my friend room to see if he is reading or not. If he is not, then I am happy. I become happy by seeing his failure to read, but I do not feel that I should myself read for my satisfaction. I am always concerned about what others doing. I try to read, but wander away into browsing and then repent the waste of my time. I know that  I am a good student and if I read I can do better than the average. But, I cannot read. I open a book and I just cannot go further. All negative thoughts about how much time I have wasted and how my friends are more studious than me fill my mind.

I cannot stop myself from wasting time. I would be really obliged if you would help me. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. The things you are facing are faced by a lot of medical students during their studies. Before medical exams they usually top the classes and score big. In medical school there are a lot of distractions and individuals usually give less time to study. But, that does not mean that they cease to remain intelligent. Lack of focus, distraction, poor concentration, etc., are the main causes of poor performance in studies. Thoughts what others are doing, seeing others if they are studying, etc., are occurring due to insecurities after poor studies. If your focus and concentration improve, then you will come out of these problems. Lack of interest in studies, poor focus, poor concentration, procrastinating, etc., could be occurring due to depression. Mild depression can lead to such symptoms. Treatment with SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) like Sertraline, Paroxetine, Escitalopram, etc., can help to reduce your bad thoughts and you should feel better. Apart from this I suggest Vitamin B12 and E supplements, which will help to improve the focus. SSRIs will improve the depressive thoughts and your focus will improve. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. Yoga and meditation also help to improve the focus and thus act as supplement to medicines. So, just do not remain depressed. Your symptoms will improve in no time.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

My complaint is face chubbiness, and I gained about 5 kg for the past 6 months, and the main problem is that I am missing my menses this month. My LMP was on 15th April. As per gynecologist advise I did CBC, fasting sugar, TSH, prolactin, HCG, total testosterone, DHEAS, FSH, LH, USG pelvis for PCOD. Doctor advised to take Primolut N but I have not yet started the tablet. Do I need to start that and what is the line of treatment? All reports were normal except the two TSH -13.740, DHEAS-53.19. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, you can take the Primolut N tablet as advised by your gynecologist. As your periods have gotten delayed by almost more than 45 days, it is unlikely that they would come naturally, even if it does, it may not be similar to your natural menstrual pattern, this is because this is an anovulatory cycle (meaning no ovulation must have occurred in this cycle). Usually, when periods come after such a delay, it could range from spotting to scanty flow to excess flow, or sometimes prolonged bleeding which may need hormonal medications to stop the bleeding. I would like to know if you face any acne or unwanted facial hair growth problems, if so, then you must be having PCOS (even if the USG is normal). And yes, you definitely need to start treatment for your hypothyroidism as your TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) level is high. Thyroid hormonal disturbance are quite common with PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome), and also it can disturb the menstrual pattern too. So, definitely you need to start your thyroxine replacement medications. DHEAS (dehydroepiandrosterone) is low, so there is nothing to worry about that. As you complained about weight gain over the recent few months, it would be advisable to reduce your weight, do regular exercises, and eat a proper healthy diet.

My GP said it did not seem like anything to worry about and to come back if it grows. I noticed no growth, but it did not go away or shrink either. A year and a half later, I developed a rash and stomach bloating and cramping, so I went to another doctor and said I was concerned the lump is lymphoma and causing the other symptoms. The doctor ordered an ultrasound. The node measured 1 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm. The results said it has the appearance of a lymph node. The doctor said I could have an ENT look at it if I like, but that he thinks it is nothing to worry about. The rash and stomach pains cleared up soon after, so I did not pursue it further. Now, last month I started to have chest tightness where my air passage felt like it was being restricted. I went to an urgent care and was put on Prednisone for ten days. The chest tightness has cleared up, but there is still a little irritation in my right lung area like I can feel something in my chest. The strangest thing is that after two days on Prednisone, I could no longer feel the lump in my neck. In two years, it had not changed, and after two days of Prednisone, I could not feel it. However, within 3 to 4 days after stopping the Prednisone, I could start to feel it coming back. It is now about two weeks since I have stopped the Prednisone and I can easily feel the lump now. It does not feel as large as before yet and would be hard for someone else to feel, but it has returned after stopping the Prednisone.I did some reading about how Prednisone can mask lymphoma symptoms, such as temporarily shrinking the nodes.

You know diabetes, hypertension are chronic ailments that can affect every system of the body. Some of these effects, particularly of diabetes, are related to the gastrointestinal tract (GIT).

His hemoglobin is always maintained between 9 and 10 units. His weight is 38 now and drastically reducing. Nowadays he has been having headache and fever now and then. Sometimes he feels that his heartbeat is fast. He is taking Desirox 500 mg (three tablets per day) for iron chelation process and folic acid (one tablet per day). Kindly suggest if he needs to take any other precaution. Can you please provide a diet chart for a thalassemia patient which can help him to gain his body mass/weight (considering food with less iron amount)?","Doctor":"Hi. Based on your query regarding thalassemia, my opinion is as follows:1. Looking at a regular hemoglobin level of 9-10%, I would suggest you increase the levels. Maintaining at this level increases further erythropoiesis (production of red blood cells). Close to 12-13 g% maintenance would be much better. Reduced hemoglobin, will reduce oxygen, which will impact overall body (weight loss) and could be the cause of headache at present. Immunity is also reduced, which is resulting in frequent infections. 2. The antibodies may be increased in the blood, which could be more due to multiple transfusions. This could be causing a reduced increase in hemoglobin levels per transfusion leading on to iron overload. You need to look for regular blood donation from a small group (committed donors or donor adaption, 5-6 donors per case) to avoid any further antibodies risk. 3. Iron chelation should be regularly done to maintain iron within normal levels. It should be done regularly. If possible, hepatic iron through liver biopsy estimation can be done. 4. Heartbeats at a faster rate due to reduced hemoglobin and increased oxygen requirement (reduced hemoglobin means reduced oxygen carrying capacity). All the cells in the body have reduced oxygen, which is functioning below the capacity, which will affect weight. Recurrent infections will also impact weight. 5. Tea with meals will reduce the absorption of food. Meat intake should be reduced. Plant-source protein would be better. Avoid any vitamin C rich food in the diet like orange or lime juice. If needed can be taken separately after 2-3 hours of food intake. Adding vitamin E supplements will be helpful. Moderate weight gaining exercises with cycling, swimming, water aerobics will be helpful. 6. Diet rich in fruit and vegetables is better for overall nutrition. Avoid food like oysters, liver, pork, beans, beef, peanut butter, tofu or other nonvegan food. Also avoid iron-fortified cereals, wheat, ragi and among fruits and vegetables, avoid prune juice, prunes, watermelon, spinach, leafy green vegetables, dates, raisins, broccoli, peas, and fava bean. Also, look for iron in snacks, candies, etc. Try to maintain intake of iron from overall diet to less than 18 mg per day. 7. As I told earlier, it is important to take more of foods which decrease iron absorption and reduce foods which increase iron absorption. For your diet, I would recommend cereals, particularly rice, oats or maize along with tea (2 cups). You can vary the diet based on taste. Vitamin C food can be taken 3-4 hours after food intake. Try to improve hemoglobin through effective transfusions, choosing a small group of regular donors is essential. If transfusions are more, particularly in the last year, splenectomy may be necessary. Try to maintain pre-transfusion of 10 - 10.5g% and post-transfusion of 13-14g%, which would help in overall improvement. Iron chelation is very important. Liver biopsy for iron and regular serum iron levels. Hypoxia (oxygen deficiency), reduced hemoglobin levels. Small group donors for transfusion, maintaining hemoglobin at 12-13g%, modified diet with tea, addition of vitamin E supplements, regular exercises. Zinc rich diet would be better. Avoid iron rich foods."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I might be suffering from psoriasis. I have a flaky, reddish, itchy hairline, back of my ears, and almost on my temples. How can I treat that?

You are having hemoglobin C hemoglobinopathy leading to hemolysis and hence splenomegaly is present. Your hemoglobin level also should be checked. In this case, as the cell turnover is high, folic acid is prescribed. If splenectomy is done, in pregnancy, there are chances of infections and other complications as per few studies. And also enlarged spleen creates trouble in pregnancy as uterine growth in pregnancy is affected and enough space might not available as the spleen is much enlarged.

I looked in the mirror and did not see anything suspicious in my throat. Since I get tonsil stones often (even though I do not feel them), I thought it was the same and would go away. One and half months later, the feeling became stronger, and whenever I swallow, I felt something on my left tonsil. When I looked in the mirror, I could see some redness and a few small veins close to my tonsil on the left side of my throat, and the tonsil itself was a little swollen and red. I made an appointment with an ENT doctor. He examined with the light and did not see anything unusual, so he suggested that it is nothing remarkable. Since I was very nervous about the constant feeling for more than a month, he felt my tonsils with his fingers and said if it was cancer, he could feel it and assured me that it is not anything significant. After two weeks, I still feel the same sensation of food being stuck on the top back of my left tonsil, but stronger and itchy. I looked in the mirror last night and noticed a big white circle on the top of my left tonsil. I have no fever, no pain in my ear or my tonsils, and no flu symptoms. When I swallow, it is harder on my left side, and I feel something on the left tonsil. The right tonsil is completely fine, and I do not feel anything unusual. I am currently on Rosuvastatin and Levothyroxine. I will include pictures and would appreciate any help.","Doctor":"Hello. Is there such a feeling when you do not swallow anything? Is there any pain or fever or soreness? Is any mucus dripping from the back of the nose to throat? Any nose block or nasal discharge? Any problem of sinusitis? How is your diet? Do you smoke or drink? Have you tried any antacid medicines or gargles? Do you have diabetes or hypertension?  Can you take another picture wherein both tonsils are seen and also the back wall of the throat?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am 19 years old, and I want a beard on my face. What should I do? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query. First of all, I want to tell you that beard growth is related to your hormones, mainly testosterone. Sometimes in some men, it took longer to grow a beard. You are still in your teen years. So do not worry and wait for some more years because as you will grow older, you will get more facial hair. The beard growth also depends on genetics too, so watch out your father and uncles too for their growth. Because some men get full facial hair in the late twenties. There is no food, supplement, or vitamin to increase the beard. So beware of these kinds of ads or supplements. Some people use testosterone gels or testosterone pills to increase their beard, but in the long run, these things have potential side effects. My suggestion to you is wait for some more years because you already have some facial hair and they will increase with time, so you do not have to worry. After some years, if you do not get as many hairs as you want, then you can opt-out for facial hair transplant. But do not do it so early because you are too young and you will get your beard to grow naturally after some years. I hope this helps. Failure of gonads or testes in men. Serum testosterone, FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), LH (luteinizing hormone), Prolactin levels.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had a total free PSA test done and these were the results. PSA 7.7. PSA free - 1.49. % free PSA - 19.4. What does this mean?","Doctor":"Hello. PSA (prostate-specific antigen) is only a screening test that can be raised in any prostate abnormality. Coming back to your query, as your total PSA levels fall in the grey zone of 4-10, free PSA is done. If free PSA is more than 25% chances of you having CA prostate decreases to less than 9 %. If your free PSA would have been less than 10% biopsy would have been recommended. So when your free PSA is 19.4 so chances of you having CA prostate is relatively less and you can be kept on three months PSA and free PSA follow up. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis. Is it a wrong way of doing?

We had unprotected sex. My last month periods were twelve days before that. Two days after the intercourse, I got cramps. I visited the doctor, and she said you are ovulating. Still, some cramps are there, and there is a white watery discharge. My periods are due on the 13th of next month. I do not know if I am pregnant; only my breast is getting heavy a bit.","Doctor":"Hello. It is true that you should have some pain while you are ovulating. But ovulation pain mostly lasts for four to five hours only. If it is from seven to eight days, then it can be due to some other reason like acidity or stomach infection, which leads to some cramps. White discharge is normal, but it may suggest infection due to which you are having pain. If you are planning for pregnancy and pain is tolerable, then I would suggest not to take any medicine for it. Wait up till 13th, and if menses do not come, then do a urine pregnancy test after three or four days. Heaviness in the breast is maybe normal before menses. If you still doubt that something is wrong and you have minimal bleeding on the last menstrual period then do urine pregnancy test today itself and not to wait up to 13th of next month. And if the pain is not tolerable, then you can take Paracetamol like tablets as a painkiller."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I got bloodwork done for possible low T.My SHBG is higher, out of the normal range, even though the rest of my blood work is very good to excellent. My doctor told me that this is uncommon. I am curious as to how concerned I should be about this?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I read your query and seen your lab reports. (attachment removed to protect patient identiy). Your report does suggest some concerning things such as high creatinine and low GFR (glomerular filtration rate), which suggest kidney dysfunction and a high SHBG (sex hormone binding globulin).  Increased SHBG levels may be seen in liver disease. I did not find any problem in your reports, but only with the knowledge about your health issues and with a proper medical history, I can find out if there is any underlying cause prevailing. Overactive thyroid: your thyroid test results are good and suggest a normal thyroid function. Eating disorders: I need more history from you to rule it out. Decreased sex hormone production in men: that aspect is good in the test results. So clearly it narrows down to your kidney function test which might be a possible reason here. Do you have any family history of kidney problems? Any Diabetes? Any excessive alcohol consumption or any over the counter medication intake? Answers to these questions could shed some light on the reason for high SHBG.  I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had marks on my stomach for the past six months. I am scared that they will spread and never go away. I consulted a dermatologist, and she said it is noncancerous. Do I need to get surgical treatment for this? I have been applying steroids for the last two months but no changes. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your case. In my opinion, the dark marks on your stomach are post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or lichen planus. It does not require surgical intervention at all. But it is important to know if other body areas are also involved. Did you have any other previous lesions in the same area? Did you ever have pustules or any itching or burning symptoms? If you do not have any symptoms, then relax, it may regress after some time. Regarding treatment steroid alone is also fine. But treatment applying a mixture of 1 % Hydrocortisone cream with 2 % of hydroquinone at night for three weeks will also help. But it may take a prolonged duration to cure.

I have not taken any medication. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query and understood your concerns. Decreased interest in almost all activities, decreased social interaction, sadness, increased sleep, loss of concentration are features that clearly indicate a major depressive disorder. The condition is clearly treatable with either medicine or psychotherapy. In my view, you should start tablet Bupropion 150 mg once a day and increase it to twice a day from day five of the treatment. Since it is a suggestion only medication, you will need a prescription to buy from the chemist. This is possible that you will see changes in your life by the end of one week and revert to me after ten days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I want to know if it is possible to correct the eyes of a child that does not focus properly.

Now two months completed still, she is having the piles problem with bleeding and pain whenever she uses her restroom and also has pain on urination. Please suggest us what to do.","Doctor":"Hello. For piles, the first and most important thing is to avoid constipation and spicy meal. Take a high fiber diet. Drink plenty of fluids, about three liters per day. Take Isabgol (psyllium) powder three tablespoons with milk twice a day. Take Dobesil (Calcium Dobisilate Monohydrate) 500 mg twice a day for seven days. Follow a strict and soft diet, which helps in passing soft stool. If she has constipation, then she can take syrup Lactulose three tablespoons at night for five days.

While walking, my heart rate increased to 133 bpm, then lowered to 116 bpm. I went home and sat down, waiting for my rate to recover under 100 bpm. It was 112 bpm after two to three minutes and dropped to 103 bpm. Then it took 17 minutes to drop down to 93 bpm. I did stress echo, echo, ECG, full blood panel and holter monitor. All results are clear.","Doctor":"Hello. This is likely due to the effect of alcohol, coupled with your baseline anxiety and activities. Normally, the heart rate goes up whenever one does activities like walking. But due to the effect of alcohol, heart rate elevation was persistent. Also, there must be some component of anxiety, as well. So mere heart rate elevation does not suggest any particular abnormalities. Most of the times, this is physiological and in response to the bodily factors. However, alcohol may cause cardiac arrhythmia like atrial fibrillation, which also involves heart rate elevation. But it is unlikely to be fibrillation because fibrillation involves sudden elevation and sudden offset rather than gradual onset. One would have palpitations and irregularities in heart beating in this case. It will not follow activities. It would be associated with other symptoms like dizziness, chest pain, sweating, or shortness of breath.So, I do not think there is anything to worry about it. If you also have a baseline elevated heart rate at other times as well, then you should do regular exercises to increase the vagal tone and lower the heart rate. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am a 28-year-old male. 1) I have been experiencing pain in my left forearm.

As there is no history of injury and the duration of symptoms is only a few days, then it is not worrying. Apply ice over the area and keep it elevated, and do not massage. Take anti-inflammatory tablets like WillgoCR or Voveran (Diclofenac) once daily after meals. If the pain and swelling increase or does not settle in a week, then you should consult a doctor. The knee pain appears to be from the knee cap and this may affect your climbing stairs and getting up from a sitting position.

I went to an orthopedist and was given some medication and wrist brace with metal support to stabilize the movement. The pain started declining for six months, but it did not go. I did an MRI for it, and another orthopedic surgeon recommended PRP injection with a month cast as he could see it as a partial TFCC. After the injection and one month cast, 15 sessions of physiotherapy, the pain persisted, so another MRI was done to check the progress. The MRI comparison showed the following: A comparison was made with the previous MRI. The previously noted and described reactive bone marrow edema in the medial corner of the proximal lunate is progressed and also showed mild diffuse edema involving the whole lunate bone. I would highly suggest further follow-up for the lunate bone to exclude the possibility of lunate bone avascular necrosis. Minimal reactive bone marrow edema noted in the triquetral bone. The stable appearance of the lunotriquetral ligament with preserved joint space. Stable central and ulnar side intrasubstance TFCC signals with no evidence of major TFCC tears. More prominent joint fluid, especially in the recess around the ulnar styloid process. Slightly more prominent ganglion cyst measuring 4 mm noted in the dorsal aspect of the wrist at the level of the radiocarpal joint. No lunate or perilunate dislocation. Normal flexor and extensor tendons. Intact carpal tunnel and median nerve. No bony fractures.

It seems that you are having stage 2-3 avascular necrosis of lunate (Kienbock's disease). I do not feel that you should wait as the disease progresses irreversibly.

I consulted my psychiatrist to use either Citalopram or Mirtazapine. I doubt to take Citalopram because I know this causes sexual side effects more often than Mirtazapine does. However, regarding Mirtazapine, I read various things online that, because it is a norephedrine activator (SNRI) instead of SSRI, it can cause anxiety to become worse. I want a second opinion, if I were to use Mirtazapine, what is the recommended dose for anxiety and social phobia?","Doctor":"Hello. 1. Both Citalopram and Mirtazapine are good choices for managing anxiety and social phobia. 2. If you are worried about sexual side effects, Mirtazapine will be a better choice. 3. Both Citalopram and Mirtazapine can take up to four weeks for the therapeutic benefits to become apparent. Some people can experience agitation and anxiety during the first week or so, but usually, it settles down. Mirtazapine has a sedative effect as well, so it should be beneficial. 4. The usual starting dose for Mirtazapine will be 15 mg once daily at bedtime. If needed depending on your response and tolerability, the dose can be titrated up to 30 mg or 45 mg per day. Medication can only be started after your doctor has ruled out any contraindications and should be able to monitor your response. 5. Finally, in addition to medication, you can also try psychological therapy and CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) for anxiety.

Symptoms: Initially, the patient reported moderate pain in chest and weakness. The patient was given medicine for gas. Since the symptoms continued for a couple more days, he also felt pressure and discomfort in the chest, he was referred to urgent care for cardiac evaluation. Diagnoses: 1. NSTEMI heart attack. 2. Troponin-I was 9.14. 3. Angiogram revealed a TVD (Triple Vessel Coronary Disease). 4. LAD has 80% stenosis in the ostioproximal part with 90% distal disease. 5. LCx has 95% stenosis in its mid part (nondominant). 6. LMS has a mild disease in its distal part. 7. RCA Dominant with a moderate disease in its proximal part. History: The patient does not have any history of heart disease and not ever flagged with any heart-related issue in past routine checkups. Risk factor: DM (Hba1c 8.2 ). A few months ago, Hba1c shot up to 11 / 12. Medicine was adjusted to pull it back to a reasonable range. HTN, the patient had a change in the job a couple of months ago, which added moderate stress. CKD (managed with borderline creatinine). Recommendations: CABG (Bypass surgery). Is CABG the preferred option for this case over angioplasty and stenting? What are the pros and cons of these options? We are told to perform the operation in two weeks. What is the risk of waiting longer? Assuming going with CABG, we also need to decide where to perform the procedure, in the local cardiac facility, or more reputed internal hospital within 3 to 4 hours of flight. How are the factors to consider? Is CABG a fairly common procedure with similar regimens?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Considering the blockages at multiple sites, which will require multiple stents to treat and his diabetic status says, the life of the stent is relatively shorter. CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting) is a preferred option. CABG involves the major surgery where risk is higher, say around 4 % (varies from center to center), and recovery takes longer. Stenting has a lesser risk of around 1 % but with a shorter life of stents. So CABG is the first choice, but stenting is an option if you are not willing for CABG. It is better to get it done early as there is a risk of a repeated heart attack. However, the risk of such attacks is minimum with medicines but not eliminated. CABG is a fairly common procedure nowadays and considering his age, it is better to perform at a higher center. So both options are available, but CABG is preferable.

I try controlling myself always, and every minute is bombing inside me, and I have headaches and frustration.","Doctor":"Hello. It appears that you have some traumatic or stressful life events that still bothers you. Your stress has started affecting you physically as well. It is better to have some counseling sessions to do some catharsis and learn relaxation strategies. Also, CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) will help you to challenge your fears and encounter your stress levels. Following may also help: 1. Deep breathing exercises. 2. Walk for at least 30 minutes per day. 3. Workout, if possible, to release toxins out of your body. 4. Reduce smoking, if you do. 5. Avoid junk, spicy foods, and soft drinks. 6.

Was it because I scraped the inside of my mouth while I was eating? Or it was because of eating something hot? Anyways it has been three days, and my gums are still sore when I eat. My gums are reddish pink, swollen, and sore. This had happened once before, but it did not last for three days. My mom asked me to gargle with warm salty water, which I have been doing for the past three days. It worked a bit, and some of the swellings have reduced, but my gums are still sore. So what should I do now?","Doctor":"Hello. Well, you have guessed it right. It seems like the most common form of gum swelling by injury from eating either hot foods (typically cheese or soup, etc.) or from eating something hard and sharp. Since a large area is injured, it will take up to a week to heal. If it continues beyond ten days, you can consult a dentist or oral surgeon. Meanwhile, continue warm salt water rinses. I suggest using a Chlorhexidine mouthwash twice daily for two weeks. It has antimicrobial properties, which will limit the chances of infection and help in faster healing. For relief from pain, you can apply an analgesic gel like Mucopain (Benzocaine 20 %) gel, 15 minutes before eating."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, About five months ago, my doctor said that I developed internal hemorrhoid (he used an anal scope), and my bleeding was from the end of my anal tract before the rectum. I have been bleeding during bowel movements occasionally. Now my bleeding seems to be very little to almost nothing. But recently I had a bowel movement and saw about two streaks of black stool and it is mucus. I do not think the bleeding is from the intestinal tract because the rest of my stool was normal. I had no pain so far. What could these black streaks be?","Doctor":"Hello. 1) This black streak is from previous old episodes of bleeding. This bleeding occurred at the end of the anal canal and got deposited as a clot, which was passed as a black-brown streak with stool. 2) The most common site of this bleeding is anal fissure, i.e., the breach in continuity of the inner layer of lowermost part of the anal canal. This occur due to excessive straining to pass stool. 3) The fissure is a self-healing condition, and the treatment is only for pain. A stool softener can be added to the treatment to promote healing by reducing strain. Excessive straining. Anal fissure. Treatment for constipation. Treatment for peri-anal pain."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

I have some mild right upper quadrant pain that’s persevered for a few weeks after stopping all cocodomol use. Over the last year I’ve had abdominal al ultrasounds, many liver function tests and urinalysis which have all come back in n normal ranges or clear. I have been told sometimes the liver can still be damaged but still present normal liver function tests and it can be hard to see on ultrasounds. Is there a chance I have some liver damage?","Doctor":"Hello. I welcome you to icliniq. First of all I give you a vote of appreciation that you were able to stop using co codamol. For chronic users of these opioid medicines, it is merely impossible to stop. Well once you stopped taking these medicines, it is unlikely that the effect will remain within you and can harm you in long term. So I do not think that you should be worried about this. Now the pain you mention which has started nearly at the time of stop of these medicines; suggest Narocotic bowel syndrome (NBS). In NBS the patient became insensitive to the usual doses of opioids and kept on increasing the doses to relieve the same amount of pain intensity with subsequent higher doses. This happen because of chronic use of these medicines would potentially increase the numbers of receptors controlling pain. Once the medicine is reduced in dose or completely stop (In your case), a rebound pain develop and it remain until another painkiller or similar opioid is restarted. So actually it is vicious cycle. Pain and increased dose cycle is sometime inevitable and requires a close monitoring of switching to other safe painkillers while at the same time decreasing the dose of opioids. The treatment is termed as Opioid detoxification therapy. To be honest, I am not an expert in it, but tried my best to explain d to you to help you understand your symptoms. If you want further guidance on how to control your pain which is possibly be secondary to NBS; I suggest you to meet with pain management specialist in near by hospital. Since you already stopped the medicines, I suggest to use Paracetomol which is rather safe medicine for controlling pain. Plus you can use Cap Pregablin 75 mg at nigh time daily to control your symptoms. I hope this will help you Take care and have a good day. Narcotic bowel syndrome Nothing Pain assessment only Functional abdominal pain syndrome Nerve entrapment syndrome NBS Tab Paracetomol which is rather safe medicine for controlling pain.

This is responsible for a small amount of blood in vomit and pain in the chest. 3) You should take semi-solid foods for a few days to promote healing of this tear. Otherwise, no specific treatment is required. 4) If pain is severe, then you can try antacid syrup to smoothen the lower part of the esophagus, which gives relief from pain and also promotes healing.  5) Also, remember, never induce forceful vomiting."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, It has been one year now, redness and fungus are not going away from the anus area.

Do you have any urinary problems like straining, poor flow, etc.? First, about your bladder distension with bladder wall thickening. This might indicate an infection in your bladder called Cystitis. If you do not have any symptoms or problem, then it is better to get 1) urine routine and 2) Urine cultural and sensitivity test. If the infection is present on the above reports, then only you require antibiotics (Levofloxacin), otherwise no need. Regarding your undescended testes, it is of bit concern. Where is it? Is it palpable just above your scrotum or not palpable at all? But undescended testes does carry a risk of malignancy or torsion. Doing surgery to keep the testes in the scrotum will not reduce the chances of complications like malignancy, but it will help to monitor your testes. So incase if any of the complication arises it will be identified early and treated accordingly. If the size of your testes is small, then it is better to remove it, as small testes means it is atrophic and not working with no hormone secretion. You should also do serum testosterone at 8 am. This is to check whether your testes is functioning or not. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 21-year-old male.

What you describe is a combination of symptoms that may or may not be related to each other. The pain, urination, and ejaculation problems, as well as the sensations you feel at the penis area, points to what we call non-bacterial prostatitis or Prostatodynia syndrome. There is no known explanation as to why it happens, but it involves the urinary system, genital system, and the pelvic floor muscles, which may also explain your bowel problems. If there is no bacterial growth in the prostatic secretions and urine, empirical antibiotics usually have only limited effect. I would suggest you have a testosterone analysis, PSA (prostate-specific antigen) testing, urodynamic evaluation of the bladder and urine, and semen culture. But your bowel problems should further be evaluated by a gastroenterologist. Pelvic floor dysfunction, Prostatitis. 1. PSA, free PSA. 2. Urine and Semen culture Urodynamics. If it is a chronic pelvic pain and prostatitis syndrome most treatments are aimed at the symptomatic causes.

Now if you are having symptoms at present, then you will need an antibiotic course for it, and treatment of choice is Amoxicillin clavulanate combination for five days. You should also have Betadine gargles four times a day for five days. Presence of pus does mean it is likely a bacterial infection, may not be strep but other bacterias. Now regarding the preventive aspect, firstly there is no reliable way of preventing it other than tonsillectomy. So you should consider this option if this is becoming troublesome for you. Now some points which would help to catch the infection are maintaining hand and oral hygiene, avoiding too cold foods which usually precipitates the infection. You should try to identify the triggers which have precipitated the infection last time like cold foods, street foods, or other triggers. You should consider the use of Chlorhexidine mouth wash on a regular basis. Next thing, you should have Betadine gargles with you.

Nasal congestion. 1. Diagnostic naso-endoscopy. The endoscopic viewing helps us to see the pathology and ascertain if the inflammation is indeed what we think or has some other pathology. It helps us to take samples for culture sensitivity and histopathology as well. 2. CT para-nasal air sinuses. Please attach the report as I see that you have already done the scan. Ideally, I would require the CT scan film that they would have given as a soft copy as well. 3. Serum IgE. 4. Absolute eosinophil count (investigations AEC and Serum IgE help us understand if you suffer from allergy). 5. Hemoglobin level, to check for anemia and rule out Plummer-Vinson syndrome also called as Patterson-Brown-Kelly Syndrome. 6. Total leukocyte count and differentiated leukocyte count. 7.

My doctor told that the clinical dose of Carbamazepine is 1600 mg per day and 200 mg is negligible. I gradually reduced the dose to 100 mg per day and then 100 mg twice or thrice a week. Later, though Carbamazepine is not considered as a pain abortive medicine, it worked for me. I used to take 100 mg tablet whenever required. For the last 6 months, I am feeling that I am suffering from memory loss. I used to have a very sharp memory. But, nowadays I forget names. Though, I do not forget events that much but my memory power of remembering names has become miserable. I even forget the name of a person I meet a week or a month ago. I have stopped taking Carbamazepine since June and I am taking Sibelium 10 mg whenever required, approximately twice a week, with good results. But, my memory especially in remembering names has become dull. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hi.

Recently, I went to the dentist for a cleaning and also was complaining about sensitive teeth to both hot and cold. On both these teeth, I have a bit of receding gums. Although the dentist did not find any cavities, he could not be sure if I needed a root canal treatment and referred me to an endodontist. The endodontist determined that there was not any infection in my gums or teeth and said I did not need a root canal treatment. But he did suggested me to wear a mouthguard at night. I told him I noticed sometimes that I clench my jaw, especially at night. He also suggested a mouth guard because, the dentin is wearing away on some of the molars, the gums are receding and there are little periodontal pockets forming in those teeth. These cracks in my teeth are vertical, straight lines. They do not look jagged like a crack in the sidewalk. They are dark in color and very thin. It looks like a small piece of hair is stuck in the tooth. I have one on my right side tooth that is on the front facing part of my molar, and may be two on the left molar but facing towards the back of my mouth. When scratching my fingernail over the surface of the vertical line, it is difficult to tell if there is even a difference in the surface texture. I do not know if these lines appear inside my teeth or on the surface. The endodontist did not say anything about these. It is hard to believe he missed them considering I saw them with my naked eye and he was wearing a microscope on his forehead and eyes. Maybe, are they normal and not worth mentioning? The reason I am asking is that the endodontist said that people who grind their teeth or clench their jaw can develop small fractures in their teeth and over time, would cause the need for a root canal. What could this be?","Doctor":"Hi.

I swelled so much 24 hours after the peel that my eyes almost shut. Yes, this was a terrible mistake. My face is still red, but slowly resolving and I have been keeping it constantly moist and have been using aloe to reduce inflammation. I have two areas on either side of my forehead that are starting to worry me. When my skin first peeled they were quite deep red, not bleeding, but almost like a road rash. The rest of my skin was red but not a deep red. These areas healed quickly but now are forming a different texture from the rest of my skin. I can feel the texture difference to the touch. I believe they are starting to form scars. So my question is, Is there anything that I can do to reduce or prevent the scar formation? I have read that massaging the area aggressively helps break down the excess collagen formation, which is what I have been doing (with my fingers), but now the area appears red and irritated from the massage. Before massaging the area, it was not red or irritated. I can definitely see a texture difference. Should I continue with the massage to try to prevent the scar tissue from forming or is this making things worse? Any help would be appreciated.

The diagnosis of scleroderma is based on clinical and some laboratory parameters neither raynauds nor the cuticle blood spots are specific for scleroderma.

I tried explaining to him it was showing some change after exercise, but he seemed to like it was not a concern and said it is normal to show a change after exercise. But I read something that, showing ST changes after exercise is a bad sign and can be CAD. Is it something I should be concerned about? Or is ST depression normal after exercise?","Doctor":"Hello. Heart rate going up might be related to you being unaccustomed to activities. At your age, normally you are expected to attain a heart rate of 180 bpm with exercise. So nothing to worry about it. Some ST depression does occur during exercise, but it is physiological and upsloping, and can only be commented upon after seeing it. However, considering your age and no symptoms while running, it is likely a physiological depression. If you can get tracing, then that would be confirmatory. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My wife is 2 months and 5 days pregnant. She is having pain under her right armpit for two weeks. It pains only if we touch it.

It would be useful if you could share any picture of the lesion, so that accurate diagnosis and advice can be given.

I have tried a retinoid, Doxycycline, countless topical creams and scrubs, a six-month course of Accutane, and nothing seemed to work permanently. Accutane was the most effective drug at preventing my acne but, two months after I stopped it, my acne came back, not as severe, though. I believe that signifies the acne I suffer from is hormonal, so I just have to wait until the testosterone I produce stops affecting my sebaceous glands drastically. But I wanted to know if there is anything else I have not tried because my face looks horrible, and I have severe hyperpigmentation from the past pimples. I was looking into a chemical peel because I was told it would make your face produce less sebum in addition to inducing collagen production. More information about my skin is that I am white, light-skinned, and about 150 lbs.","Doctor":"Hello. It seems like you have had really bad acne and have been trying hard to improve it. I would suggest you not to stop the treatment abruptly as it usually leads to a flare. Instead, once the acne is controlled, you should reduce the frequency to a maintenance dose, such as weekly once or twice, for a longer-term. Salicylic acid peels do work well for acne and oily skin when applied correctly. You may need four to six sessions, with monthly one session frequency. Chemical peels even help to lighten your post-acne pigmentation. Do not prick your acne as it leads to infection, scarring, and pigmentation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was recently diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, and pharyngitis. I am currently on some temporary medicines, and antibiotics to treat these sicknesses along with an inhaler. I do not feel that bad, but I need to take the pills. However, being in college, I have a big game this weekend. This question may seem to be a little stupid but, would mixing of alcohol with antibiotics be deadly? Or would it just slow down the process of making me better? I know it is a silly question to ask, but I am half minded on it and would prefer not to end up in the hospital.","Doctor":"Hello. I guess you are taking medicines for bronchitis and pharyngitis. So most probably it is an antibiotic medicine. Generally, we advise to take medicines after food with water, and within limits taking some medicines with low alcohol does not cause any harm. However, it is best to avoid to do so. The idea of taking medicines with alcohol is not advised as it can be harmful. Alcohol and some medicines cause gastritis, and you may vomit out. Also, it can cause liver toxicity with such combination. So there is no logic of taking medicines with alcohol. Also, alcohol intensifies the effects of certain medicines, and alcohol can not dissolve some medicines. Serious interactions also can occur.So it is a better idea to consult your doctor before doing so."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 30 years old female.

You have a lot of questions, let me answer one by one. 1. Fluoxetine is good medicine for OCD (Obsessive-compulsive disorder) and depression cases. 2. If this is the first time you are having the problem, you should take medicines for at least six months, if not then continue longer. 3. Fluoxetine will control your depression. Staying happy is your job. 4. I strongly recommended taking counseling (talk therapy) sessions. 5. Therapy will help you recognize the negative subconscious thoughts which are keeping you in the loop of depression. 6. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (a type of talk therapy) is very effective in OCD and depression cases, and the best results come when done while taking medicine. So that you never have this problem again, or even if it occurs, it is not this severe. 7. You can find a counselor in your city and talk in detail about what you are going through, so you can get better help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 16-year-old female.

You have already taken the first step in acknowledging the problem and trying to get the support. Try to practice relaxation strategies regularly. Practice deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation exercises daily. You can also try yoga and meditation. Try not to avoid social situations. Avoidance only leads to perpetuating your anxiety. Try to face anxious situations in a hierarchical manner. Start with the least anxiety-provoking situation and gradually work your way up as your confidence increases. For example, start talking to two or three people initially. When you are comfortable, try to address a small group. Then progress to talk to a bigger audience. Take your own time, but try to expand your comfort zone gradually. If you are experiencing any significant anxiety symptoms, you can consult a psychiatrist for further assessment.

You definitely have less red blood cells than expected but also you have low white blood cell count. That definitely makes me think about some problems related to the bone marrow where those cells produced. With the production of less red and white blood cells, it is also expected you have a low level of blood proteins. Let me tell you about your abdomen-pelvis scan. Scan quality is good, they started with noncontrast, then got venous-routine phase with also additional delayed phase. Liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, bilateral adrenal glands, and kidneys look normal. Uterus and bilateral ovaries are normal. Bladder is normal. What is abnormal? Intraabdominal fluid, ascites which explains your fullness. Good news is no evidence of ovarian cancer or any other masses. I highly recommend you to see a hematologist and maybe sample bone marrow. I strongly believe you have bone marrow disease regarding to production of blood cells, if you would like to read about it, it might be some mild form of pancytopenia, although your platelet number still looks low normal.

Two months back I had some testicle discomfort. The doctor gave me 10 days Ciprofloxacin. Last month I had unprotected sex. About six days later I had a sudden strong tingling in my scrotum that stopped me in my tracks. I had a chlamydia and gonorrhea urine test a few days later but was urinating so frequently that I could not hold my urine at least an hour before the test, and the test was negative. Frequent urination continues till today. I also had Keflex last month, a full panel STD test this month, and everything was negative. But wondering if the antibiotic mixed with me filling up the cup way more than 30 ml could skew the test? I did contract genital warts, most likely from this encounter (showed up three weeks after). I started 28 days of Bactrim about a week ago and symptoms have not cleared. Frequent urination and tingling scrotum are still there. Also, my lower back by my spine hurts, but does not feel like a kidney thing. It hurts for a bit. Wondering if a spine injury could affect my urinary system. I guess even though I took two chlamydia and gonorrhea test, I am paranoid that the two negatives may have been skewed from urinating too soon before on test one and being on antibiotics or providing a large volume of urine on test two. And the partner is of medium risk. She has no symptoms. The urine test was done with the Aptiva Combo 2 RNA/TMA test. There is no discharge, just this persistent urination and unable to empty bladder.","Doctor":"Hi. I have noted your concern. I do not think that the tests for gonorrhea or chlamydia would have been affected due to a higher volume of urine or oral antibiotics as the urine test relies on the detection of the nucleic acid material of gonorrhea or chlamydia which would have been present. Your symptoms could either be due to urinary tract infection or they could be those of prostatism.

They will grow automatically nothing more you have to do. It can extend up to 6 months. Hair fall has nothing to do with the hair shaft.

What you need to look for is a huge hematoma (collection of blood beneath the skin), blood in stools, and urine.

If any, then he also needs to be treated to avoid recurrence. Use a condom or avoid sex until you get cured."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 37-year-old male. I have been getting bouts of dizziness, which can be described as an electric shock in my head. There is also a feel of nerve twitch in my temple. I also found that my reaction time is a bit slower. I did a cardiac screening, which involved a stress echo. The echo test and Holter monitor are all clear. My doctor referred me to an ENT and suggested for MRI of the brain and both the ears. The ENT suggested tests to check my vision and to check for vertigo. The test report states that my eye movement was out of coordination, which is consistent with a central lesion. My questions are: 1) What is the cause for brain zaps and dizziness? 2) What is a central lesion, and surely would it have shown up on an MRI? 3) Is central lesion a degenerative disease, and does it lower life expectancy? 4) Is it curable or reversible?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. You are suffering from dizziness and electric shock over your face with some incoordination of eyes as per your ophthalmologist. Nothing from Cardiac, eye and ENT. The problems seem to be a neurological disorder. It is good that your MRI Brain is normal, that means no structural lesion like tumor or mass or demyelination. Still, there are many reasons that cannot be seen on MRI and we need to evaluate those. The answer to your questions are: 1. We need to find out the causes with further testings. 2. Central lesion means brain or brainstem related causes of your dizziness. 3. & 4. Degenerative lesion at age 37 is less likely. We need to evaluate it, and only after that, I can say. So, 1. Give me a detailed description of your dizziness bouts. How it starts, any trigger? How long it is lasting, and what is the duration of your disease? Does it aggravate with position change? 2. Are you suffering from slurred speech, imbalance while walking? 3. I want to see your MRI brain, and you might need MRI brain with angiography and contrast injection study. Then I will give further advise."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 26 years old and having a lump on my breast and was advised to do an ultrasound.

I used to live in a house that had mould issues, and I am not sure if this brought on the sinusitis. I have been using Avamys nasal spray and Texa allergy tablets. For the last three weeks, I have developed a new symptom. I am having a problem with breathing at times. It varies between blocked sinuses to being unable to take full breaths. I have limited mucous discharge and do not know the reasons for the new issues I am having. I have consulted with a cardiologist, and he has found no issues. I do have a ct scan detailing issues with my sinus, but my doctor did not feel it severe and prescribed diet and Avamys nasal spray. My doctor also prescribed Topzole tablets believing it could be acid reflux as I was getting a burning sensation on the upper center chest area. I do also suffer from mild trigeminal neuralgia in the cheek area. Another medical issue is neck and lower back pain related to discs. The symptoms tend to get worse at night. I sleep on my left side, and as soon as I lay down, I am unable to breathe. I can now only sleep either on my right or on my back. Unable to breath makes me anxious and results in not being able to get much sleep. Also, it is hard getting used to sleeping differently.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Now the condition is that he cannot even inhale oxygen through the nose. He is inhaling through his mouth. And he is so weak that he cannot use the restroom by himself. Doctor adviced him to do echocardiography. The report shows the presence of fluid in the left lungs. We admitted him to the hospital immediately. Doctor removed the fluid of about 1.5 liters out of 5 liters, and the fluid is reddish. Again they did a CT scan, and they are telling that a lump is seen in the upper side of the left lung. They want to do a biopsy. But we do not want to do so because, if it is a malignancy, then we do not want to operate that. Please suggest what to do.","Doctor":"Hello. As you said, your uncle is suffering from left pleural effusion with left lung cancer. According to your history, he is very symptomatic and needs draining of fluid frequently to relieve dyspnea. Also, your doctor has rightly said that we must do a biopsy of the lump, to find out the exact type of cancer to start appropriate chemotherapy or radiotherapy as per the report. It is not necessary to do surgery all the time. But if he is having a recurrent collection of pleural fluid, then he might need a procedure called Pleurodesis to close the space around the lungs to prevent the recurrent filling of fluid. So it is up to the wish of the patient and relatives to start chemotherapy or not after the diagnosis of cancer is done. Otherwise, you can continue with only symptomatic (palliative) treatment and frequent tapping of fluid to relieve dyspnea.

I wanted to know if there are any non-surgical methods to treat this condition. She is having severe abdominal pain, accompanied with pain between the shoulders. She is having this problem for more than 8-12 months now. In addition to the problems that I have mentioned, she says that she can not eat anything. Even though she feels hungry, she says that her stomach feels full. Also, she says that she experiences a severe burning sensation whenever she eats or drinks anything. She is not taking any medications for this specific issue. She takes medicines for soothing the burning sensation down her throat to the chest so that she can eat peacefully. Apart from that, she takes medicine for keeping her blood pressure in control. Though she does not have any heart disease, she does take some medicine for heart as a precaution. We did an ultrasound, and the reports are attached. As per the report, she has multiple gall stones, along with the possibility of the adhesion of the gallbladder with the bowel.

Oral intake of water should be initiated upon admission if she did not complain of nausea or vomiting, with a progressive increase of liquid and food intake according to her oral tolerance.

And every morning I remember what had happened in my dream. How can I fix my flying mind and concentrate on one thing deeply? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Lack of concentration can be due to many reasons. From what I understand in your case is that you are under a lot of stress. When the brain is in stress, it tends to avoid the main task of finding relief by focusing on non-essential things. The first thing you should do is take up measures to reduce stress. There are many such exercises on the internet, and you can pick the one that works for you. Secondly, you should work on procrastination. Instead of studying for long hours, and draining yourself, take frequent breaks and use the Pomodoro technique. There are various skills you can learn to improve your concentration. There are many courses you can do. I do not have the details of your situation, so I can not suggest more. If still, you feel the need, you can talk to a counselor or take an online session and can discuss the details of the problem and find a solution."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother is 64 years old and diabetic for 12 years. Recently she visited a dentist to get a denture. The dentist told that two pre-molars (1 up and 1 down on left side) have to be root canalled even though there was no pain in them because those teeth were not in good condition which he said after looking at an x-ray. I do not have any of those x-rays. So, the root canal was done on those two teeth, and cotton was placed there and asked to wait for one week. There is no pain at all. After one week, the cotton was removed, and the cement was placed. Within a few hours, the pain started, and it was increasing pain. The dentist then removed the cement and again placed cotton and asked her to wait for one week. No pain at all. Again on cementing, within few hours pain started a lot. Again cement was removed, and cotton was placed. This cement and cotton alternation has been going on three times (for three weeks), and the dentist says it will work at some point in time, and the cement will be permanent. He says the pain during cement is due to the gas pressure from the gas release by the microbes sitting on the remaining disintegrated pulp. If even finally it does not work and pain does not go away while with cement, he said he would make an antibiotic injection or spray on those teeth. I do not have any x-rays, so this is the only information I can give. My question is, Does this procedure look normal and logical?","Doctor":"Hello. I need those pre-operative x-ray to make any comment, but as you do not have them, I can only make decisions based on your explanation. Through your explanation, it does not seem normal. There was no need for a root canal; rather, the dentist could use those teeth for denture support. But as she is a diabetic and periodontal loss of attachment is common in diabetics, so maybe those teeth did not have enough strength to support, that is why all this procedure has been done. Be sure before the final cementation of those teeth, cementation should not be done with pain. If pain persists, there is no other solution for a root canal treated tooth other than extraction, and then full mouth or complete dentures will be provided to your mother. Kindly reply me back with the x-ray if you find it."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Sometimes, I feel my left ear is blocked. It is shut when I got too much of cough and bad throat. What should I do?

Also, syrup Alex (Phenylephrine, Chlorpheniramine Maleate, and Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide) 2 tablespoons may be taken for cough and whenever needed up to two to three times daily. Also, you need to do Betadine gargles four times a day. You may have Otrivin (Xylometazoline) one drop two times a day if having a nose block.

The gauze piece can be generally removed after one to two hours, provided everything is normal. Otherwise, you can change the gauze piece, along with the medication on it, and you can put fresh cotton. I do not know what your dentist had suggested to you. But I would suggest you can remove it, eat ice cream or cold beverages but do not sip. Sipping can apply force on your extraction site. Do warm water and salt rinse after 24 hours. Do not rinse too harshly just put little pressure. Do not eat or drink anything hot or hard or spicy for 48 hours.

My girlfriend thought it would be fun to remove my pubic hair one night. She started the waxing process, but after the first removal strips had been off, I decided I was never going to do that again. It was very painful. I agreed that using a razor to shave everything would be fine for now. I had never shaved my pubic region, and later it became a bit irritated and sensitive, but nothing I could not survive. About a day later, I started running a high fever (around 102.5 F) for a day or two, then ended up going to the ER after I found that my lower leg was red and swollen as well. They diagnosed me with cellulitis. As soon as they started running IV antibiotics, my fever broke, and things looked good. They sent me home with Doxycycline, and I was good. I am only mentioning the cellulitis as there was no evidence of cuts or scrapes, so we do not know here the infection came from, but now I think it could be from the waxing or shaving torture that I had been though. My penis had been sore after the shaving, and I recently have been masturbating dry (no lubricant) quite a lot, four times a day was common. My penis was a darker color from the excessive masturbation and sex. Even though it was uncomfortable, I still did it. So a few days ago after having 3 or 4 sex sessions and previous masturbation before that, I noticed a couple of small bumps on my middle shaft that morning. There is no pain, no itching, and no redness. I have never had anything like this before, and I am very observant with my body. They have been there for 2 to 3 days, and have not changed at all. I stopped sex and masturbation after noticing them. I have no other symptoms. I was worried about herpes, but they do not seem to match any of the pictures I see online. I do not have redness, tingling, pain, or itching. They are at the same spot where I was feeling the friction burns earlier. My girlfriend just so happen to have a full Pap smear a week ago, and they did STD testing, and everything was normal. My last partner was over six months, and we had protected sex. I always ask about sexual health and everything to try to be safe. I understand that the majority of herpes happens within a week of exposure and that the first outbreak is the worst, but they can hide dormant for long periods. It feels like this is a dumb choice to shave and irritate my pubic region and also do excessive masturbation and sex while ignoring the friction pain, and I possibly ended up with a friction blister type of situation. If I start getting other side effects, I will stop by my doctor. I just wanted a professional to chime in.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. First of all, I would like to tell you that you only have small bumps over the shaft of the penis. There is no discharge, redness, itching or tingling. Most of STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) results in discharge, mild fever, and redness. While in herpes, severe painful blisters are seen over the penis. So based on the description you provided, these small bumps are not due to any STD. This could be due to excessive masturbation resulting in bumps, but for exact diagnosis detailed examination is needed. But yes, these are not due to any STD. Also, most of STDs have small incubation period and your partner is tested negative for any STD, so these also prove that they are not due to any STD. Abstain from masturbation for few days and avoid any hard frictional rubs and you will be alright. You can upload a picture of lesions for confirmation too. Thanks and take care.

This is the most common question we encounter in our daily practice. One thing I want you to understand is that the surgery which has been performed was a ''life-saving procedure''. If that were not done, we would have lost her; luckily, thank God that did not happen. The rest of the recovery is actually unpredictable. Depending on the extent of the damage, the patient will recover after this sort of surgery. Positive things are she has survived, she is off the ventilator, her injury was more on the right side and not on the left side. So there are pretty good chances that she will improve eventually. If it had been more injury on the left side, we would not have expected her ever to speak again or calculate again. That is not the case with the right side. She would open her eyes in less than a week. Other functions will take time to recover up to six months.

But in your case situation is different. So there can be some neurological issues which is leading to exotropia.

I had an ultrasound where liver is enlarged more than 20 cm and I had a fibroscan as well 353 and 18.1 median, kpa. Kindly suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. I can imagine how upset you must be about your overweight and liver issues. Well, I assume you now have a thorough idea of how this weight bears an impact on your liver. And with such amount of weight it is not uncommon to have a fatty liver disease with enlargement of liver size. The normal liver size should be no more than 13 cm. Despite the fact you have severe morbid obesity, thankfully you deserve a vote of appreciation for struggling so high to reduce your weight by 15 kg. This is a good sign by the way. I would urge you to continue this in future whatever you were doing for the weight reduction. Since you did not mention whether you still having alcohol and smoking? It is important to know that fatty liver plus alcohol can both damage the liver and the impact is much higher if both risk factors are combined. I should strongly recommend you to reduce the alcohol intake if still taking or completely stop it. Your liver may not be able to tolerate more insult because of alcohol. Now coming to the numbers which you have shared. The Kpa value more than 12 is suggestive of the development of fibrosis which is not a good sign. However, this value is often erratic or falsely high if someone has obesity or fat within the liver as may be in your case. To confirm whether you have that degree of fibrosis, you have to get a liver biopsy which can tell the exact grade of fibrosis and can differentiate whether the insult to your liver is because of alcohol you had in past, or because of fat due to obesity. The CAP value of 353 is suggestive of the amount of fat you have in the liver. This can however, indirectly confirm the damage to your liver is rather secondary to fat and not due to alcohol but again this has to be confirmed on liver biopsy. If you are not inclined to liver biopsy, I suggest you to continue with the weight reduction strategy, completely avoid alcohol intake and keep monitoring your liver function tests and fibroscan every six months. Alcohol-related liver disease plus obesity and fat-induced liver disease. Complete blood count. Liver function test. HbsAg, Anti HCV antibody. Serum ferritin, serum iron, total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation. TSH, FT3, FT4. Serum carbohydrate deficient transferin (CDT) levels. Serum albumin, total protein and AG ratio. Serum Creatinine, Bun, electrolytes, Alpha fetoprotein (AFP). Weight reduction. Alcohol abstinance. Follow up after investigation to propose plan of action. Follow up to provide more information and after investigations, or earlier if required."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 51 years old female and suffering from anxiety for decades. Recently it became debilitating, and I ended up in the ER and had an EKG because of heart palpitations. My doctor prescribed me 10 mg of Escitalopram and 1.5 mg of Xanax. The Xanax was supposed to be taken as needed, but I misunderstood and have been taking it three times a day (5 mg every eight hours). After six weeks, the SSRI is not helping much. My doctor has increased the dosage to 15 mg. I took the new dose at night and felt awful nauseous, depressed, and lethargic in the morning. Is this the wrong drug for me, or should I go through the side effects? My goal is to feel well enough to start weaning myself off the Xanax. I have not been able to eat solid food for weeks.","Doctor":"Hello. Escitalopram is an effective medication for managing anxiety disorder. The usual dose is between 10 to 20 mg daily. You are currently on 15 mg. Side effects can occur commonly in the first two weeks of starting the medication or increasing the dose, and then it tends to settle. Take your medicine after food to minimize nausea. Depression and lethargy can take up to two to four weeks to get better. Taking Xanax (Alprazolam) regularly for more than a month can lead to dependence, and it will cause a withdrawal effect. Consult your doctor and discuss the earliest to gradually taper off Xanax in a safe manner. Do breathing exercises and muscle relaxation exercises."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am writing on behalf of my father. Two years back, my dad was terminated from the job and was depressed. Suddenly one day, he started doing some weird stuff just like as he was possessed by the devil. He tried to commit suicide and jumped from a building, but luckily he survived and we took him to a doctor. He prescribed some medicines, and he became alright, but after six months, he started doing the same thing. It has been two years and now he seems to be stable, but he does not go out and always stays at home.","Doctor":"Hello. From your description, it looks like your father had probably developed stress-induced depression and psychotic features after losing his job. I can understand that it would be tough for your father and the whole family. It is positive that he is stable now. But he will need further support to help him function again. You mentioned that he does not go out and always stay at home. It could be due to several reasons like anxiety, residual depression, negative symptoms, and ongoing stressful feelings related to losing his job and social stature. It is advisable to get him reviewed by a psychiatrist and consider counseling and psychological support. It will help to gradually regain his confidence and function better. Gently encourage him to go out for walks during the early morning or later in the evening. It will be better if someone accompanies him. Also, try yoga, which can be beneficial."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My baby is 2 years old, has cold with mild fever, consulted the doctor, he gave Maxtra syrup, and nothing else as chest and throat were clear.

There is no improvement, so I gave him homeopathy medicine for five days. He was better but not fully recovered. Still had a running nose with thick discharge, then again my husband said to visit allopathy doctor, did so, he gave antibiotic Azilide Azithromycin 200 mg for five days. I have done the course, but no change. Again consulted another doctor, he said he has an infection in his nose; he prescribed Augmentin. I am tensed, now he is having vomiting, loose stools because of the previous antibiotic course. Augmentin yet to start. I do not know what to do as I read online that this running nose will take about three weeks to settle on its own. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I understood your concern. 1. I advise you to follow Pediatrician advise. 2. You can start Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid). 3.

If he is cranky, not taking foods orally, or looking sick, then please visit the Pediatrician. 6. It may take time to resolve the symptoms. I would suggest you consult a Pediatrician and get him examined and do the necessary report if required. We need to find out the problem for better treatment. 7. Based on your history, I can say that cold may take one or two weeks to subside completely.

The most common cause for your problem must be urinary infection or a stone in the kidney tube. Since sonography is normal, infection is more likely. Do a urine culture sensitivity test and start an antibiotic. I suggest tablet Nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice daily for seven days consult your doctor for the same. Drink plenty of fluids.

Majority of the time, they are of benign origin and does not pose a threat. Some of the common causes could include taking tobacco, alcohol, caffeine. High blood pressure, anxiety and rarely heart diseases could also be a cause. In your case the Effexor you are using could make you experience more PVCs.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

According to your statement, you have been suffering from TB lymphadenitis and taking 4FDC (antitubercular drugs) for the last 22 days. Your query is whether surgery is needed for your lymph node or not. Antitubercular medications are enough for curing TB lymphadenitis. Surgery is needed in rare cases. Surgery can be done for diagnostic purposes or therapeutic purposes. Sometimes Fine needle aspiration or biopsy of the lymph node are needed for proper diagnosis of TB lymphadenitis is known as surgery for diagnostic purposes. If TB regimens for 6months or 7months or 9months are failed to subside the lymph node, then surgery is an option. Again during TB treatment if there is any change in size, shape or presence of discharging sinuses or turn into malignancy, then surgical drainage or removal of lymph node may be needed. Otherwise, antitubercular medications are enough to treat TB lymphadenitis. Your physician has advised you to do a CXR (chest x-ray) for the detection of chest involvement. You should undergo CXR. Again Prednisolone 40 mg/day for six weeks followed by gradual tapering over the next four weeks along with your current TB regimens are enough to cure your TB lymphadenitis without any surgery."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis.

I suspect that I may have a hormonal condition, such as PCOS or hypothyroidism, and wanted to get an opinion based on my symptoms. I have compiled a list of symptoms that I have been experiencing so far; 1) Excess hair growth: “Beard” area, bikini line, legs, underarms, nipples. Shaving and waxing cause painful ingrown hairs, despite correct shaving technique. 2) Bloating and constipation: Sometimes, without a bowel movement for around a week. Distended abdomen, made worse after particular meals. 3) Irregular periods: Often skipping a month or coming twice in the same month. It can be very long (several weeks), short (a day or two), heavy (bleeding though tampon in less than an hour), or light (just spotting). Occasional gushes of watery, pinkish blood discharge. Minimal cramping, no unusual pain. 4) Sleep problems: Trouble falling asleep and waking up refreshed. Often tired during the day, even after a full night of sleep. 5) Fatigue: Almost always sluggish. “sick” feeling. Lightheadedness in the shower. 6) Anxiety: Feels irritation and becoming overwhelmed and emotional. Often a sudden onset. 7) Skin problems: Dyshidrotic eczema on hands. Mild to moderate acne on the face, shoulders, back, stomach, bikini line, butt, and legs, leaving marks for long periods. Recurring pink, irritating rash-causing discharge inside the belly button. 8) Small amount of weight gain: Around 10 lbs. Very visible around the midrib area. A few stretch marks on back and legs. 9) Overly visible veins, especially in legs. 10) Irregular headaches, sometimes accompanied by bloating and constipation. 11) Scoliosis: Occasional back pain after long periods of standing, sitting, or physical activity, which does not cause significant problems. 12) Mild thinning of hair on the head. I need advice based on these symptoms. Is it likely either of these conditions or something different?","Doctor":"Hello. Your symptoms are suggestive of PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome). However, there are certain conditions that mimic PCOS, like thyroid, adrenal problem, and hyperprolactinemia, etc. You need to visit a gynecologist or endocrinologist as certain details like testosterone levels, ultrasound abdomen, and pelvis, thyroid, and cortisol; etc., are needed If you are overweight or obese, losing weight can improve many of your symptoms. Losing just 5 % of your body weight can help a lot. The most common treatment is to take birth control pills. The pills do not cure PCOS, but they can improve many of its symptoms, like irregular periods, acne, and facial hair. Birth control pills also protect women from cancer of the uterus. Women with PCOS can live normal lives. But it is important to consult a doctor and treat accordingly.

I have been having eye trouble seeing squiggles and floaters in my vision. Also, I cannot focus, and it seems like the lighting goes different. Two years ago, I got into a car accident and suffered a concussion. I do not know what it can be. It is also hard to see at night, and I do wear glasses.","Doctor":"Hello. Floaters are usually due to changes in vitreous (jelly in the back of the eye) when it starts liquefied and detached from retina. It often is the aging process after the 40s to 50s age, but in cases of trauma, surgery, or myopia, it can even be at an earlier age. As you got two risk factors injury or accident, myopia, floaters may be associated with flashes or a curtain infront if the vision. The important thing is to examine the retina because this vitreous detachment from the retina can create some hole or break in the retina that can lead to retinal detachment (not in all cases). Usually, no treatment is done, and you learn to ignore floaters with time. But I would suggest you visit your eye doctor and get your eyes examined to make sure everything in the back of the eye is fine."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have hyper burning in the stomach to chest area left side only, empty stomach burning much after taken food, cold water, fruits some relief but not full relief.

As your symptoms have started long back, you need proper evaluation. There are many causes of burning in the stomach and belching like gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastritis, peptic ulcer in stomach or duodenum, gall bladder stones, infection of the gall bladder, esophagitis, etc. In my opinion, you need an ultrasound of the abdomen and endoscopy to find out what is the cause of your symptoms. Sometimes inappropriate dietary habits like not taking meals at the proper time, eating a lot of junk food, oily, spicy, fatty food, excessive tea or coffee intake, less water intake can cause acidity and burning. Some infections of the stomach like H.pylori infections or hookworm infestations can also cause such symptoms. I suggest you go for an ultrasound of the abdomen and endoscopy to know the root cause of your symptoms so that proper treatment can be done. Drink a lot of water. Avoid tea, coffee, soft drinks, spicy, and oily food. Include more fibers in your diet, like salads and green leafy vegetables."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have pain and numbness over both hands for long, and fingers recently.

Meditation is very useful in fighting against depression. Do exercise or walk daily. This will release a happy hormone in you, and you will feel good. In Ayurveda, a lot of medication is mentioned for depression. You can take 1. Ashwagandharishta 10 ml with water twice a day for two to four weeks. 2. Take capsule Brahmi one capsule with water twice a day for two to four weeks. 3. Take capsule Guduchi one capsule twice a day with water for two to four weeks.

A most common symptom of herpes is the burning sensation. Sometimes this is masked too. There is a high possibility that if you get it again, you might have a burning sensation. But every patient has his resistance, and response is different. For acute reactions, antivirals are given for five to seven days depending upon clinical presentation. But for chronic cases in which patients have repeated infections, prophylactic treatment is given for six months to one year. In my opinion, it works to relieve your presentation. So it will help you and will not make the situation worse. It is important to take antiviral therapy even if you do not have any symptoms because vesicles are highly infectious and contain millions of viral particles, and you could transmit to others. So it is better to get treated."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 28-year-old woman staying with my fiance in a live-in relationship.

Soon, we consulted a Hematologist and he advised him to do certain lab tests. The reports are ready except one that is JAK 2 ARMS PCR. We are little bit worried over him. Kindly go through the attachment and advise us with your valuable opinion. Does he have any serious health related issues? Your prompt reply will be much appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello. I have read the attached report of your brother (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The main abnormal finding in CBC report is elevated red blood cells count and PCV. The hemoglobin level is also raised slightly. So, it is suggestive of polycythemia. It can be secondary which is more common or primary. The primary type include problem in bone marrow for which your brother have been instructed to investigate with JAK2 study. It will help in ruling out primary polycythemia. The secondary cause includes respiratory disease, cardiac disease, chronic smoking, dehydration, etc. So, if any of such history is present or if smoking history is present, then kindly mention it to guide you further. I suggest you drink lots of water at least 2 to 3 liters per day. He needs to stop smoking if he is having habit of it. Additionally I suggest you investigate with chest X-ray, EKG, serum EPO estimation for further work up. Kindly revet back with reports once done including JAK2. He has to repeat CBC after 15 days to check red blood cells and PCV value again. Do not worry. Most of such cases are secondary polycythemia.

I underwent surgery in the past for both eyes. I wash my eyes with baby shampoo and have used ocusoft products; nothing seems to be helpful.","Doctor":"Hello. A chalazion is caused when glands (meibomian glands) in eyelids are blocked. Chalazion sometimes reduces with anti-inflammatory drops but very less. There are two options left now since it has not reduced, intralesional steroid injection or surgery (Incision and Curettage). I suggest you get it surgically removed. It is a minor surgery in which just a small incision is made in the inner part of the eyelid, and the contents are scooped out. Since chalazion is recurring, you have to get your blood sugar tested along with complete blood count (CBC)."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

He was using insulin injection, 20 ml in the morning, and 12 ml at night. A recent blood test shows that the RBS value is 265 mg/dl, and the creatinine value is 2.1. Now, as per the doctor's advice, he is taking insulin, morning 30 ml and 15 ml in the night. He is also taking his pressure tablets. Could you please suggest some diet to reduce sugar level? He is 150 cm in height and weighs about 70 kg.","Doctor":"Hello. I understood your concern. Since your father's blood glucose level is not under control, the doctor is right in increasing his dosage of insulin. His weight is a little on the higher side. A reduction in weight can help both his diabetes and blood pressure readings. Some of the dietary tips to follow: 1. Instead of 3 major meals in a day, divide it into six to eight smaller meals. 2. Increase the intake of fiber-rich food in the form of raw salads. 3. Reduce the intake of carbohydrates like rice and rotis and increase the quantity of vegetables in a meal. 4. Avoid simple carbohydrates like sweets and sugary drinks. My concern is his creatinine level of 2.1. I advise you to consult a nephrologist without any delay, to assess his kidney functions.

This does not mean stage D. This is likely stage C. However, he has to undergo echo for ejection fraction, which would tell us regarding stage. If, despite all medical treatment, he remains symptomatic and not able to do any activities then may be considered stage D. Such intermittent worsening of symptoms may occur in heart disease, which gets settled with medicines. You should get his medicine optimized. His life expectancy also depends on ejection fraction.

If your baby is passing stools quite often and is feeding well, has got sleep after feed and passes enough urine, i.e., six to eight times in a day and gaining weight, then you need not worry. For the blocked nose, you may clean frequently or use saline drops. Probiotics are usually not of much help in this age group; breastfeeding is recommended.

Olanzapine is an effective medication in this situation. 2.5 mg daily is a small dose only; it is not too much ( usual dose can go up to 10 to 20 mg daily). Encourage and support your friend to take her medication daily.  Since she is reporting some symptoms like not able to see properly, can not hear, unclear speech, it is advisable to get her reviewed by a psychiatrist to assess whether they are part of her illness thoughts or whether she is experiencing any side effects to her medication. Following an assessment, psychiatrist can adjust the dose accordingly. Your friend will need support from her family & friends until she gets recovers from this stressful episode.

While taking them, my mood was pretty consistent with only a few times of feeling slightly depressed. But while I took them, I still was overthinking and had stress that consumed my thoughts. But, even when my mood was consistent, I still felt kind of boring. It could be from outside factors like school but I still have excessive thoughts about things outside of school. After taking the medicines for so long and having switched from different medicine before and trying different doses, I thought maybe it is time to cut out the Zoloft altogether. So I went to 50 mg, then down to not taking it at all about a week and a half ago. For the first 10 days I felt pretty much the same but for the past three to four days, I have been very irritable and today especially feel completely numb. Also, today for the first time since stopping Zoloft, I felt the stress and overthinking that I usually felt while taking Zoloft. I have been trying to find the right medicine and amount of medicine for about a total of six years to feel my best. I am not sure if I am just overthinking. Stopping it makes me think that I will be more depressed which makes me actually believe and feel that it is just lack of sleep mixed with female hormones. I really need to find the underlying issue of my feelings and figure out what is best for me. Ideally, I would like to feel my best without medication but the Concerta works well for me. I am not sure if the Concerta plays any role in my mood and stress. I really need guidance. I had Lexapro in the past for the same issue.","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, regarding Zoloft (Sertraline), it is an antidepressant medicine which increases the level of serotonin in the brain which in turn aids in a normal mood. If such a medication is tapered suddenly or stopped suddenly then rebound symptoms of anxiety and depression occur. So it is advisable that if these medications are to be tapered then it should be done gradually. Also, these medications should not be stopped till the patient has become totally stable and normal. Even upon reaching normalcy these medications are to be taken in a maintenance dosing course before one can plan on tapering or stopping them. It would be advisable that your main complaints are discussed in detail so that a proper medication regimen can be planned. Now on to regarding the use of Concerta (Methylphenidate), it is basically a psychostimulant which is usually prescribed to children suffering from ADHD (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) who have poor attention and concentration span. If it is taken by a non-patient, though it may help in improving concentration and attention. It carries a high risk of addiction. So, it is advisable to stop Concerta.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

He has been having pain in his scrotum and testis area for the past 6 to 7 years after every 2 to 3 days whenever he does not masturbate or does not have sexual intercourse. If he masturbates daily or has sex daily, the pain does not come but if he misses it for even two days the pain and heaviness come back which goes away only after ejaculation. We got married almost one and a half years back but he has been having this problem for a long time. He says it all started after a few years back whenever he would get aroused after watching porn and could not masturbate. He has not consulted any doctor yet. What could be the reason for his problem? I am worried. That pain and heaviness sometimes make walking difficult for him.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. He has persistent testicular pain which develops usually when he does not masturbate or have sex. If the pain is persistent and is severe then that should be evaluated. The causes should be ruled out in order to make the diagnosis. Infection in testis should be ruled out first. Though any granuloma, torsion are other rare possibilities. Non-specific testicular pain is seen in a lot of individuals. His urine and semen analysis should be done. Scrotal ultrasound should also be done. This will grossly rule out possible causes. A prophylactic antibiotic course can be given if there is any mild infection or there are pus cells in semen. Doxycycline can be given for at least four weeks. Anti-inflammatory drugs like Ibuprofen should also be given regularly in order to contain the pain. This should solve the problem. If the problem persists and all investigations come normal, then that pain could be due to some psychological reasons. Drugs like Amitriptyline, Nortriptyline or Duloxetine can be used. These drugs can help to alleviate the pain and he will become normal. The drugs should be used regularly for at least 6 to 8 weeks. This will help to treat the chronic pain condition. So please do not get worried, just get his investigations done and rule out possible causes. He will be alright. Take care.

RDW (red blood cell distribution width) is used to determine the type of anemia, it indicates the average size of the red blood cells. Your values are a little bit above average but nothing to worry about. Alkaline phosphatase is a substance that increases if there is an obstruction in the biliary system, your value is within normal. Level of albumin is also within normal.  The hepatomegaly is most likely due to fatty changes that are most likely due to alcoholic liver disease or high blood cholesterol. I suggest that you perform complete lipid profile.

The last time I was sexually active was over two months ago, and after that, I usually would masturbate two to three times a day with no lubricant.

About a week later, I ended up getting drunk and masturbating pretty hard and for a long period of time and got a few more red bumps within the next couple days. Then, I shaved against the hair since I had hair going all the way up my penis shaft. I had several bumps the next day. The original bump has gone away as well as the other bumps.

We thought it was the COVID at the beginning but it cannot be because he had no other symptoms and me and my children have been in contact with him and we have no symptoms (knowing that I have health problems and have asthma) so we went to a doctor who prescribed diarrhea medication. Since the fever has dropped and it does not exceed 37.7 (so he continues to take Paracetamol) but for the past week he has been suffering from abdominal pain more precisely below the navel. So we went back to see the same doctor two days ago, who gave him an ultrasound that showed nothing abnormal. He diagnosed a colopathy but I have the impression that this diagnosis is wrong. He started this treatment that same day but until today there is no improvement. He still suffers from abdominal pain especially after going to the bathroom and fever although low (maximum 37.7 °) got as high as 38.8 tonight, no more diarrhea but little constipation. What do you recommend that I do? Could it be something serious knowing that the ultrasound showed nothing abnormal? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I feel very sorry to hear about your husband, and very rightly understand your concern and temptation for his unresolving symptoms. You are perfectly right that if treatment were given rightly he should have shown some improvement but unfortunately he did until now. So considering all the information you provided to me, there are few possibilities. First of all, is typhoid fever which is a bacterial infection. The second is intestinal amebiasis which is a parasitic infection. Typhoid seems to be likely possibly given his almost 10 days of fever, and in second week, he started to develop abdominal pain which is suggestive of typhoid ulcers in small bowel. I would suggest him an antibiotic course for at least 10 days, and a maximum of 14 days which would cover both potential bugs. I also want that you get him some blood and stool tests before starting antibiotic course. The antibiotic course is relatively safe. I also want that you closely examine his chest for the development of rose spots. They are very small pinkish marks which develop among patient over the chest in the second week of the illness. Do not worry they are harmless, it is just a manifestation. I really hope his symptoms will improve like a fever would start settle, and abdominal pain should resolve in the next 48 to 72 hours of the start of the antibiotic regimen. I would also want to know the assessment/prescription of a previous doctor who said about colopathy. The colopathy is a very broad and vague term which means colon (large bowel) inflammation. It has a number of causes the one is painkillers (NSAIDs) and recently COVID 19 has shows some case reports with colopathy. But if your family and he himself does not have any contact history to COVID 19 positive or suspected case, then the possibility is very rare. Ultrasound is not a sensitive investigation for the disease which involves the bowel lumen such as in your husband's case. Ultrasound is more helpful in disease involving liver, spleen, or gall bladder. So it is not uncommon to have a normal ultrasound with conditions like typhoid fever or intestinal amebiasis. So I am writing him antibiotics for 10 days now if the improvement is shown we would increase up to 14 days. I really hope with this course his symptoms will start settling in the next 48 to 72 hours. And lastly, get some blood and stool tests as I suggest her and discuss the reports once they are available. Typhoid fever. Intestinal amebiasis. C. difficle infection. Colopathy. Complete blood count. Blood culture and sensitivity (before starting antibiotic course). IHA titer for E. Histolytica. Stool detail report and ova parasites. Stool for fecal calprotectin. Stool for C.difficle infection and stool for culture and Sensitivity (before starting antibiotic course). You can ask him to give sample today and start antibiotics just after giving the sample. Capsule Cefixime 400 mg twice daily for 10 days, tablet Flagyl 400 mg thrice daily for seven days (this antibiotic can cause metallic taste in mouth and or decreased appetite) for that you can give him tablet Levosulpiride 25 mg thrice daily half hour before meals for nausea, appetite. Take home cooked meals, take good amount of water, mineral water if possible (both infections are acquired after a contaminated food or water). See me after labs, and earlier if any further concern."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis. Is it a wrong way of doing?

For the last week, I have been waking up with a one-sided blocked nose and slight throat irritation. The side of the nose blocked changes, I think depending on which side I lay down on. I then blow my nose hard, both sides and the blocked nose seems to disappear until the next morning. Mucus comes out when I blow. A few days ago a little blood streak with in the mucus but not last couple of days. I have been reading on nasal cancers and am really worried. About a week ago when I woke up with a blocked nose, my eyes and eyebrows were hurting. I am sure I had something similar last year. I have heard of MRI for a separate reason around 6 to 7 months ago and they said everything was fine including sinuses. If it were nasal cancer would one nostril be blocked all day rather than just the morning? Also, would it always be the side of cancer (mine switched sides in the morning sometimes right nostril sometimes left)? Are these symptoms ones where I should be worried about cancer?","Doctor":"Hello. Answering your questions: The explanation for your symptoms: It appears like an acute rhinopharyngitis only. This is inflammation of the nasal and pharyngeal cavities. In the initial stages or when the immunity is good, it affects the way you have described. Mornings congestion of throat and nose block is common with rhinopharyngitis. You have mucus also. Mucus when dries up forms crusts inside the nose and when these crusts get dislodged they cause abrasions inside the nose and that can cause bleeding while you blow the nose. Hurting of brows and eyes could be due to sinusitis which is a sequela of rhinitis due to the block of sinus ostia which open into the nose. Is there running nose, sneezing, decreased sense of smell or facial pressure? Any ear symptoms or a headache? Suggestion: See the quality of mucus, if it is thick yellow and smelly you may need a course of antibiotics. Otherwise nasal decongestants and systemic decongestants would suffice. In either case, avoid smoking till you are completely fine. Take non-spicy warm foods and do not drink till you get better. Avoid citrus fruits also. Drink plenty of warm liquids and water. Can apply few drops of Otrivin nose drops before sleeping in the night. Do not use the nose drops continuously for more than 4 or 5 days. Investigations: I do not feel you need to do any investigations now. But to rule out cancer, you may want to do a CT scan of nose and PNS (paranasal sinuses-non-contrast one). A complete blood count with serum IgE also would be ideal. For more information consult an ENT otolaryngologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 22-year-old female.

Usually my periods last six days, but this one lasted eight days. I stopped my birth control pill and I have had regular periods since then.

I do not think you should worry too much about having a period after six days of finishing a normal period. In fact, your ovaries could be suppressed by birth control pills and have not returned back to normal function although you had normal menses.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Earlier I had a BP of 160/96 after which I started taking Stamlo 5 once per day on doctors advice. However, in between, I had dizziness, nausea, and vomiting due to which I met another doctor who changed Stamlo 5 to Aquazide 12.5 biweekly (only on Sunday and Thursday). Will I have a severe problem with my BP as the dosage seems too low? He also suggested taking Stamlo 2.5 everyday instead. What should I follow?","Doctor":"Hi. I can well understand your worries. I have reviewed your query details. If all the side effects are just due to overdosage of Amlodipine (brand name Stamlo 5 mg) then better is to take 2.5 mg (taking a half dose). If the problem resolves, it is fine. If not, then we can go for other medications. My personal opinion is, it looks like you are having problems due to little higher dosage than you need. So keep taking Stamlo but half the dosage (that is 2.5 mg and this is all what your physician also agreed to)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 24 year old female. I have dark underarms.

I can understand that premature ejaculation can be a very serious problem for a newly married couple. Premature ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, and lack of sexual urge are all three different problems. Most of the problems can be overcome by simple techniques. Try to have a good amount of intimacy with your patner, which is called foreplay before going for intercourse. Stop smoking if you are one.

This calls for a visit to the emergency department to meet the gynecologist for a per speculum examination to rule out cervicitis and establish the origin of blood either from the cervix or intrauterine.

I am suffering from back rim pain, leg pain. How can I reduce my uric acid and what kind of food diet I should follow and which food will reduce my uric acid?","Doctor":"Hi. Well, to be honest, uric acid of 6.9 is not very high and moreover in females it very rarely causes arthritis unless it is post-menopause. Secondly, the pain due to uric acid are different and very unbearable. It usually causes swelling of one joint, associated redness and warmth and the pain is such noone ever forgets. So we need to look into other causes of your pain. As for the uric acid of 6.9, best you can do is diet control and adequate water intake. Amongst the diet, avoid red meat sea food, soft drinks and liquor. Increase the dairy products intake, more of water, brocolli, ginger.

If it is negligible, then it will be fine with the spherical lens only. If it is significantly high, then you must need toric lenses. You can get a customized contact lens from some good optician or lens dispensing shop according to your refractive error and color of your choice.

Abilify is Aripiprazole and is an antipsychotic drug. In a low dose, the drug might help to ease withdrawal if you suffer any. But since the drug is different from Effexor in pharmaco-dynamic actions so I do not think the drug can help in reducing the severe withdrawal symptoms.

Well, among thyroid problem, it is the hyperthyroidism that causes tremors, but your mother has hypothyroidism. It could still be due to thyroid medications if the dose is very high.

It can either be a normal pregnancy, or the pregnancy can be ectopic (in fallopian tubes) and thus should be further evaluated. Get a serum beta hCG levels done. It is a blood test that has to be done twice 48 hours apart. If the value doubles (or increases by 66 %), it is a normal pregnancy. If the growth is less than that, there are chances of ectopic pregnancy or missed abortion. Also, by the time the value of beta hCG is 2000 or more, the sac should be visible in the uterus (happens around four weeks or more). Please get the above investigations done and do not ignore the condition. Serum beta hCG twice 48 hours apart. USG early pregnancy when hCG reaches 2000.

Therefore the best remedy to treat your acne is to address the triggering factor. In your case, you should try and avoid stress. Stress sometimes leads to harmonal disturbances, which in turn cause acne. If you do not want to use Isotretinoin, you may use Adapalene or Salicylic Acid ointments, which also give effective results. Even before going into the sun, you can use a good sunscreen with Spf 50.

It is unfortunate he developed but it does not mean it is the end for him. As long as he takes his medications, does his routine laboratory workups and checks with his physician then there is nothing much to worry about. He must be informed that as long as he consults with his physician regularly then there will always be an expert making sure he is doing alright and making sure that no complications will develop because of the disease. If the pandemic is causing more worries, it is normal. He might be aware that his condition puts him at a disadvantage compared to a normal healthy individual. But as long as he adheres to social distancing, proper handwashing techniques, precautionary measures such as wearing masks and PPEs (personal protective equipment), if needed, then there is a low risk he might acquire the disease. Remember, diabetes and COVID-19 both are preventable diseases. He needs to take care of himself properly and to do this is by following his doctor's orders and guidelines during the pandemic. However, I am worried about the declared respiratory rate of 86 (normal is at 18-22). Does he smoke? Any cough or colds? Previous hospitalizations? At this rate, it is best to bring him to the ER for further evaluation. When counting for the respiratory rate it is the one cycle of the rise and fall of the chest.

Although both the conditions will cause swelling, in your case no swelling is present but throbbing is a sign of inflammation. So, start anti-inflammatory treatment like Diclofenac 50 mg or Ibuprofe twice a day. Get an X-ray done to look for a repeat fracture. Use ice packs.

Fungal infection can also cause pain, which is usually seen in diabetic and immunocompromised which I suppose you are not. Middle ear pain is caused by acute infection without ear discharge or chronic ear disease. Acute inflammation without discharge means your drum is intact, so ear drops will not reach there. Chronic ear infection with impending complication wil also cause pain. I do not know whether you have any history of ear disease before. In short, the ear drops you had used were not needed.

The answers to your questions are as follows: 1. Central neurocytoma is not a cancerous tumor. However, depending on the grade of the tumor, it can have a recurrence. 2. The goal of surgery currently is to achieve safe maximal resection of the tumor. If some portion of the tumor is left behind, it can be addressed with adjuvant therapy, such as radiotherapy. Again, the histopathology will guide us on whether adjuvant therapy is required or not. 3. The medications provided are not to cure the lesion. There is no medicine to cure this tumor. 4. And there are possibilities for recurrence of the tumor. 5. There are side effects of the prescribed medicines.

I have done a urine test and microscopic examination also, but they were normal. I do not know why I have this feeling. It is irritating me. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. The feeling of discharge could be attributed to the precum if it is associated with sexual stimulation. Other than this, there is no health condition that can describe your symptoms. If the discharge is associated with sexual stimulation, nothing to worry, it is normal. Even otherwise also, any discharge which is nonpathological does not require any treatment. You can reassure yourself. If you are still worried, I suggest taking Silodosin 8 mg one tablet in the night for 15 days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering with Psoriasis. Please suggest treatment.","Doctor":"Hello. I saw your photograph (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You are having psoriasis and I would like to tell you about your disease. Psoriasis is a relapsing condition and usually exacerbates in winters. It will not spread to other people by touching. It will not affect your internal organs. It is treatable but not curable. It will get cleared but can reappear. Nothing to worry about it. As it is in limited area only application of topical steroids will suffice but if there is more body involvement then we will start oral medicines. Presently, I am prescribing your treatment and you can review in 20 days. Papulosquamous inflammatory disorder. Liver function test and complete blood count. Chronic plaque psoriasis. Topisal 6% (Clobetasol propionate)ointment for local application in evening, tablet Levocetirizine 5 mg evening. Coconut oil for local application in evening and morning. Use oil or moisturizer. Keep skin supple. Review after 20 days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a heart patient, and I am on Plavix and Aspirin. I have multiple blockages in my legs. Is it possible for a clot to form in legs, and then it moves to the heart, causing a heart attack when I soak my legs in hot water to relieve my restless leg syndrome? Similarly, can multiple clots in the heart be a cause for my restless leg syndrome that occurs in my right leg alone?","Doctor":"Hello. I assume that you have blockages in arteries, and if blockages are in arteries, then they will not migrate to the heart. Instead, there will be a pain while walking, and if it is severe, it may lead to gangrene. If blockages are in veins, then they will migrate to the heart and lungs. As you have multiple clots, then we can suspect that there might be some damage to your nerves, causing the symptoms. I suggest taking a tablet, Neurobion (vitamin B complex supplements), and Pregabalin."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 7 years old boy has asthma for about a few years.

Considering that the child has not been able to keep anything in the tummy and having repeated episodes of vomiting, I would suggest an Iv (intravenous) line be put in the hospital for giving Iv ondem and Iv fluids if required after getting the child physically evaluated by a pediatrician. Take the child to the nearest hospital for nebulization and iv line administration. The saturation is also needed to be monitored for this child. An x-ray chest should be done as well."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have noticed recently that I am having problems with reading, and this has never happened before. I am usually good at reading but the other day when I looked at a paper and read it as \\"65\\" but I looked away and looked back, and it is actually \\"75.\\" This has been happening a lot with things like texts too. The first time I read a text, and it said, \\"I am probably free,\\" and it is very clear and definite. But then I looked away and back and it actually said \\"I will probably be free\\". They are similar, but it concerns me because when I read things the first time, it seems so definite, that is what it says. Also, I have noticed there is a kind of gap in time like I will be standing on one side of the room, and then I will be on the other side without really remebering walking there. Also, I have intense mood swings, like one night I will be listening to sad music and crying, but then the next night, I feel inspired and motivated to start a bunch of projects. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query and understood your concerns. Although it is difficult for me to decide what is wrong with you, without talking to you but considering your age and kind of presentation, the most likely cause for such reading gaps is lack of attention. This is common in most of the youngsters. The second possibility is stress. Most of the adolescents are bombarded with a lot of information, and sometimes it becomes difficult to manage all the information while keeping things in order. According to my clinical experience, I see at least one or two adolescents complaining of forgetfulness and attention problems solely due to stress. I hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My back upper tooth is feeling strange. But it does not hurt. I have checked to the dentist and doing some scan. But everything fine, what could cause this issue? Is it fine?","Doctor":"Hello. If x-ray also has nothing, it means there is no cavity. So the probable causes for your problem are, 1. Food impaction between teeth, which will cause such feelings for three-four days and will go away on its own. Use warm salt water for rinsing a few times a day for three days. 2. Sometimes sinusitis, i.e. infection or running nose, may cause discomfort of upper posterior teeth. For it, you should show it to a physician. If you feel there is specific pain which is increasing then show to one more dentist as the previous dentist might have left some finding. If you can, send the x-ray so that I can examine too. Use saltwater and a painkiller for three days and wait if it goes away."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My LMP was a few months back. I did not get periods after that.

I went back three weeks later and the baby was measuring 6 weeks 1 day. Is it possible to ovulate that late with no period?","Doctor":"Hello. Congratulations on your conception. Yes, it is possible to ovulate late. In fact one of the causes of delayed periods is delayed ovulation. Make sure you take your Folic acid supplements and get your routine investigations of pregnancy done (blood group, complete blood count, urine r/e, fasting blood sugar, TSH, HbsAg, HIV). Please avoid exposure to radiation and inadervant drugs during pregnancy especially in the first trimester.

The penis even in flaccid state is dipping down. I feel some tight sensations around the body of my penis. Also, the sexual excitement has very much reduced.","Doctor":"Hello. The best way to know for your erection problems is to do an erection test by a urologist. It is done by giving small injection at the base of penis and create an erection, then the urologist does a physical examination to see if deformity is within normal limit or it requires any correction. Penile suspensory ligament injury usually happens after external trauma, and not related to skin problems.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

The pain just happens if I hold heavy objects or been in a long trip in a rocky road or face my computer for hours.","Doctor":"Hello. It seems it is the result of the trauma you have had two years ago. Muscle or spine bone damage may have occurred. That can be understood doing a MRI examination of your spine. Anyway if that does not happen often, there is no any specific treatment you can take about that. Just take any painkiller when you feel pain (Ibuprofen) and nothing more. Avoid weight lifting or hard physical activity. Avoid long time standings. If you are overweight, lose some kilograms. You can do some light spine exercises or physiotherapy to remove pain and numbness of your back. If no improvement, then see a neurologist for further assistance.

My main concern is the cartilage, as my dad has a problem with inflammation. I would like to know what is the best action to take.","Doctor":"Hello. Pain may be due to sudden lifting of heavyweight, which resulted in compression and tissue swelling. If the duration of injury is within two days, then apply ice and from the third day, go for physiotherapy treatment like ultrasound therapy on the back of the knee. Do not worry much about the pain, and just keep strengthening your front and back thigh muscles like the hamstrings. This will help with the knee pain."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 25 years old, and I always have breakouts before a week of my periods. I think it is a hormonal imbalance. I get big, red, and painful acne around my jawline and lower cheek, and I have a high testosterone level. I get these kinds of breakouts almost every month for more than a year now. I am not under any treatment now, but I used topical cream containing Hydroquinone, Tretinoin, and Mometasone. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Based on your symptoms, the diagnosis is acne vulgaris (grade 2). Do not apply Mometasone cream over the face, as it is a steroid cream. Please get an ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis during the second and third days of the menstrual cycle to rule out PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease). I would suggest: Consult a specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. Please review it after three weeks."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I had a bad pain in my left arm and jaws. Lightheaded and dry mouth, and hence got the test done.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your reports, and they are normal. This is unlikely to be related to the heart. A similar kind of pain may occur in reflux disease. Do you get any bloating, burping, soar water feeling in mouth or chest burning intermittently? If yes, then it likely indicates reflux-related pain, and even otherwise it may be related to reflux or esophageal spasms. So, I do not think there is anything to worry about it.  You should be on antacids like Pantoprazole, Domperidone combination for a week or two. Also, avoid oily fatty, spicy food, and avoid smoking alcohol if any. Have regular exercise and avoiding resting immediately after the meal instead have some walk. I hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 26-year-old male. I am doing regular exercises, but one day at night I got sudden palpitations, dizziness feeling, high bp, so I went to the emergency room my ECG was regular, sinus tachycardia after that few tests were also done. Lipid profile was normal with no diabetes, and no cholesterol, TMT was negative, but in ECHO it was showing mild LVH, but my doctor said my heart is fine no problem with it. He said it was due to anxiety. So I want to ask is mild LVH a problem. I get anxious because of my heart health.","Doctor":"Hello. I believe by regular exercise, you mean that you are involved in some muscle-building activities and some aerobic exercises. The symptoms you described were sudden onset palpitations associated with dizziness continuously, and by the time you reached ER, the palpitations were settled. Is that correct? Next, you had a normal ECG (done when symptoms subsided) and normal TMT. Although this is reassuring but does not entirely rule out disease. Now, your Echo revealed mild LVH. My assessment will be following diagnoses based on some assumptions above in order of likelihood, 1. Normal - Although I have not seen the echo films or it the report but assuming it is mild concentric LVH, this can be found in athletes and is nothing to be worried about. This is the most likely possibility so you can rest assured. 2. Supraventricular tachycardia which subsided by the time you reached the ER and only fast heart rate was present due to anxiety. Less likely possibility but not a condition to be worried about now as this condition is usually intermittent and not at all dangerous. It is diagnosed often when ECG did while symptoms are happening. If you had symptoms when ECG was done, this is even less likely. 3. Ventricular tachycardia in a structurally normal heart, very less likely. This also is a benign condition in a normal heart. So, in a nutshell, your doctor was correct. Most likely this is nothing but regular sinus tachycardia. Kindly follow these things, 1. Rest assured. 2. Continue with your regular exercise. 3. Maintain a healthy lifestyle- no smoking, low carbohydrate diet, maintain body weight (BMI <25.5 kg/m2)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Before two years I was in a lot of pressure and anxiety, while I was eating shawarma.

Sometimes my throat makes like a small bubble very small bubble that I can feel is going big like then it explodes with these sounds, but that feeling is like 1 %, not that big feeling. It is like a sting, and I do not know what is that? I went to the doctors, and they did everything they can. And in the end, I did Endoscopy (I have hiatal hernia). He gave me anti-reflux, and to be honest, and I tried them all Pantoprazole, Esomeprazole, Omeprazole, Zantac, Rantac, Disflatyl. Nothing works, I am still nauseating. And I was so unhappy, after four months from using these medications I went to a good doctor he said maybe your problem is psychological, I went to the psychological doctor, and she gave me (Cipralex). And to be honest, after a month, I felt here I am, back again. And nausea disappeared. I was on Cipralex for like nine months, and no nausea feeling. Now the doctor said, lets lower the dose and stop it. I said, I feel fine. It is four-month now since I stopped the Cipralex. And the nausea feeling came back. And I am really scared about that.

If oral medicine is not helpful in increasing hemoglobin level then Iron injection can be prescribed. 2. Your vitamin D level is low. So take Cholecalciferol sachet 60000 IU once a week for eight weeks. The tablet also can be taken. 3. You are known case of diabetes and blood pressure. The blood sugar level is still little high. So need to control with life-style measures as well like exercise and low fat and low sugar diet. The kidney might be affected due to diabetes so your estimated GFR is low.

There are sebaceous glands in our eyelids. Sometimes their secretions are blocked it is becomes a nodule called chalazion more common in people who got acne. Usually, it is painless, but if it becomes infected, it can cause pain as you said, you feel you might need to get antibiotic tablets (like Augmentin if that suits you) and some pain killer. Warm compresses are also helpful to open the ducts of glands. In the majority of cases, it resolves at its own. But if it does not improve, then a minor surgery (Incision and curettage = a small incision and removal of cheesy material), or sometimes a steroid injection, can be injected to avoid surgery. So do not worry. In your case, you need to take oral antibiotics and pain killers for five to seven days, and I hope you will be alright.

The overall vertebral body height and alignment remains anatomic. The bone marrow signal intensity is preserved without evidence for bone bruise or fracture. No suspicious focal osseous lesion is identified. The conus is normal in overall size, morphology, and signal intensity terminating at the L1 level. The cauda equina is unremarkable in appearance without nerve root clumping or mass effect. No intradural mass lesion or extra-axial fluid collection is identified. There is a tiny low-grade strain of the paraspinal musculature approximately at the L2 level. Tiny scattered vertebral body hemangiomas are visualized. There is no suspicious osseous lesion at T12-L1, there is no significant disc pathology. The central spinal canal and neural foramina are widely patent. At L1-L2, there is no significant disc pathology. The central spinal canal and neural foramina are widely patent. There is mild bilateral facet arthrosis, with a small posterior projecting right facet joint cyst and tiny left posterior projecting facet joint cyst.

At L4-L5, there is a small diffuse disc bulge with mild disc height loss, disc desiccation, and mild bilateral facet arthrosis. This results in mild effacement of the ventral thecal sac, where it abuts the traversing L5 nerve roots in the lateral recess without significant displacement or compression. Mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing is present. At L5-S1, there is there is mild disc height loss, disc desiccation, and mild bilateral facet arthrosis.

As potential effectiveness of allergy happens while treating a chronic case of eustachian tube dysfunction, mild approaches to treat this proved ineffective.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to iclinq.com. Eustachian tube (ET) opening allows the passage of air into the middle ear. The middle ear is a chamber that has to maintain a certain volume of air in it for normal hearing function. For the air to go away from the middle ear, it requires further air flow from the eustachian tube. Due to various metabolic activities, there is always a negative balance of air in the middle ear due to air absorption by blood vessels. As for as eustachian tube is concerned, its opening is in the throat, and it is guarded by muscles and cartilages. Whenever any inflammation occurs in the throat or behind the nose, the mucosal covering of the ET gets thickened. Allergy can also cause mucosal inflammation and obstruction of ET. The reversal of ET function depends on the success rate of it."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My father underwent surgery for a blood clot in his brain before 10 months.

Frequent falls, if associated with any symptoms after the fall, will usually effect the brain. Symptoms like loss of consciousness, vomiting, fits are dangerous. You need to be more careful about falls and prevent them. Crying at night is a common symptom. Normally baby cries during the night if he is hungry or having any discomfort or just wants to be cuddled. If he is fine later, it is probably normal. Sometimes worms can be present in the anal area, causing itch and disturbs the sleep. If the problem persists, then consult your doctor, as he needs to be examined."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 12 weeks pregnant, and for the past three months, I have severe constipation. I consulted the doctor, and she suggested me to take Duphalac syrup. I tried, but there is of no use. The same problem persists. Will it affect my unborn baby?","Doctor":"Hello. Constipation is common in the early stages of pregnancy. It is due to the chemical increasing in your body, which is required for your baby to grow. So the baby is fine, no need to worry about it. For constipation, I suggest you should take Duphalac syrup two tea spoon at night every day. And if it is not working, then take two times a day. Do not drink cold water, drink lukewarm water. Drink more water three to five liters per day. Eat green leafy vegetables more. It is the only solution.

Do you have a headache all the time or more when you wake up from sleep? Is there any family history of glaucoma?

Can you please suggest me a better sunscreen gel or lotion for sensitive skin?","Doctor":"Hello. As your skin is very sensitive, I suggest you use Himalaya herbals protective sunscreen lotion. It can be applied for half an hour before going outside. Use it always before going outside, whether it is a sunny or shady day. Because even in shady days, the ultraviolet rays can harm your skin. Drink plenty of water to keep your skin hydrated. Drink a glass of water before going outside on sunny days whenever possible it will help to reduce dehydration of your skin.

After some time, I got a short period for one time; then it stopped for another three months. I started feeling unwell and thought it was just due to stress. I had some discharge, which was not itchy but had an odor. At first it was clear, then the discharge was creamy with a pink tinge for over a few days. The discharge became light bleeding after intercourse. I then began spotting, which lasted for approximately three weeks. I had intercourse with my teenaged partner and had pain followed by a medium to heavy bleeding, which lasted for over a week. It began to lighten, but I am feeling very unwell, nauseous at times, lethargic, etc. I had sex again, and during intercourse, the bleeding was heavy, accompanied by pain. Since then, I have heavy bleeding with clots. The odor is still there; the pain seems to have subsided, but I am bleeding, and passing clots and my vagina feels painful. Can you give me some advice on what this might be.","Doctor":"Hello. Post-coital bleeding, along with vaginal discharge and menstrual abnormalities, must be further investigated. It can be due to uterine causes like a polyp or more likely due to cervical causes like polyp, erosion, LSIL (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion), etc. You need to get a serum TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), PRL (prolactin) value done along with USG gynae (ultrasound). You also need to get a per speculum examination done along with PAP smear and colposcopy. Check your hemoglobin level to assess the blood loss and need to be compensated if any. I suggest to take table Tranexamic Acid 500 mg one tablet, three times a day for the bleeding. Please note that the medication is just for the symptomatic relief, and you must get the investigations mentioned above done even if the symptoms disappear for the time being. Hb, TSH, PRL, USG Gynae, pap smear and colposcopy. Cervical erosion, cervical polyp, LSIL/HSIL, and uterine polyp.

The wound has not healed still now. He is on Meropenem 1000 mg medication, and Colistimethate Sodium is also being used. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. As your father is diabetic, he has low immunity against infection. Wound healing may take some time. Deep sternal wounds are very common after CABG (Coronary artery bypass grafting). Both antibiotics he is using are very powerful. If they are not effective, then I would advise you to stop antibiotics for three days and do a wound culture and sensitivity test. This will show the type of microbes present and the antibiotic sensitive to it. Have the evidence and treat it accordingly. Take other general measures like: Keeping the wound clean and dry. Apply povidone iodine solution daily. Remove the cloth that rubs against the wound and keep the patient's environment clean."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Normal sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia shows ECG reports.

No sinus arrhythmia in an otherwise asymptomatic individual with no major diseases is not of any concern. Less than 30 % of people below 31 years of age have sinus arrhythmia. Do not worry at all with sinus arrhythmia in your case. 2. No, sinus arrhythmia does not rule out or rule in heart disease in your case. 3. I have chest pain? What to do? Although I do not have details of the characteristics of chest pain like onset and offset, character, duration, and radiation, etc., hence, I will not be able to say definitively what kind of pain is that but I would encourage you to tell more details about the chest pain as I mentioned, also family history, and then appropriate course can be decided.

Yes, you need to get that remaining part called root stump extracted. There must be a hole in which chances of food lodgement are there. Till you get it removed, you have to take care to avoid food lodgement there and protect the area from infections.

We requested him to do his homework in a soft voice and tried consoling him to study. Eventually, we gave up and heavily reprimanded my kid almost every day. Sometimes we beat him if things do not happen as expected. Later, we feel sorry for reprimand or beating. But, for the sake of his future, we console ourselves for behaving in such a way. I wanted to ask if we are doing the right thing? Is beating a child advisable? What should be done if he does not study even after requesting him in a soft voice? Please guide me.","Doctor":"Hello. Your experience with your son is common among many parents. The situation can be managed with appropriate support. Find out the reason why your son does not like to do his homework. Is he lazy or having any difficulties with studying, reading, or maths? Does he have any problems with attention and concentration? Discuss with his class teacher about how he is doing his work at school. If he is able to manage well at school, then learning difficulties are less likely. But if he struggles in school as well, mild learning difficulties need to be ruled out. Also, make sure that his vision and hearing are good. Regarding your questions, beating regularly will never be helpful. It is not easy, and it can be frustrating if the child refuses to do as told, but reprimanding and beating in this situation will not help. It will make your child feel negative, make him more stubborn, and make things worse in the long term. Use positive praise and rewards liberally. You can enforce discipline by using negative consequences if a child is not following rules (like limiting the access to TV, games, etc., for a short period). Follow a carrot and stick approach, which does not involve reprimanding or beating the child. It may take some weeks to see the difference, but both parents have to be consistent in your approach.

From the symptoms detailed, you have allergic rhinitis. Do you have a history of sinusitis? Sinus tenderness which can be elicited by applying pressure over your head, on cheek bones? Do you have congestion or blocked nose? Well the main cause of allergic rhinitis is the allergen that may be indoor, outdoor, occupational, pets, dust, smoke, incense sticks. Management includes,  1) Environmental control that is to identify and eliminate the allergen. This is the mainstay. Try to identify the trigger, avoid its exposure. 2) Pharmacotherapy, this includes T. Mont- L (Montelukast, Levocetirizine) evening 6:00 pm daily once. 3) Tablet Allegra 60 mg twice daily. 4) Intranasal Otrivin sprays if you have blocked nose only for five days. Intranasal corticosteroids, Beconase AQ or Flonase (Fluticasone) or Rhinocort, Nasacort (Triamcinolone) two to three times daily.  It may take a few days for the effect to start.

I am afraid of taking Venlafaxine due to potential withdrawal symptoms. Is it recommended to stop immediately or continue until the side effects subside?","Doctor":"Hello. You are on a low dose of Venlafaxine (37.5 mg once daily) to manage your anxiety. Usually, the dose will be increased to 75 mg once daily after a week or so. In your case, consult with your doctor about any increase in dosage. It will take one to two weeks for you to get used to the medication, and then you will have the therapeutic benefits gradually. In most people, side effects will wear off when the medication is continued for one to two weeks. If it is difficult for you to manage the side effects or if it does not wear off, consult with your doctor so that he can monitor you and switch to another medication if needed. Follow relaxation techniques like breathing exercise and progressive muscle relaxation. It will help to manage anxiety.

Based on the mammogram report (attachment removed to protect patient identity), you have heterogeneously dense breasts (Category C). There is no visualization of obvious breast lesions.

Do you experience any other side effects apart from sexual side effects? Mirtazapine is the antidepressant that is least likely to cause any sexual side effects. So it can be continued until your depression is better. Consult with your doctor about gradually weaning off Paroxetine and Dosulepin while monitoring your health. Also, Clonazepam should be gradually weaned off, if using for more than a month. Added to that, seek counseling.

The cough cold and fever could be due to viral infection, does your child have wheezing also? If no wheeze in the past I suggest you use any other antitussive medication for cough, Levolin (Levosalbutamol) is a bronchodilator used in cough associated with wheeze, so if no wheeze and dry cough give Ambroxol or Dextramorphan, for cold give an anti-allergic like Phenylephrine and Chlorpheniramine maleate, as far as fever is concerned give Paracetamol suspension every four to five hours for at least three days irrespective of fever.

To have full and safe abortion medically, get an ultrasound early pregnancy done to see for the presence of cardiac activity (doses differ with presence and absence of cardiac activity) and also tell us whether you have had previous cesarean or abortion. Please do not take the medication without the test and in some random dose as it can cause immediate and long term complications.

To differentiate, you must undergo urine routine/microscopy, urine culture, and swab culture of vaginal secretion. For symptomatic relief, you need to drink lots of water (additional 3 to 4 litres/day) along with cranberry juice. Also, use a condom during sex and use a good lubricating jelly in abundance.

I would like to advise you that you get an ultrasound of lower abdomen with kidney bladder and pelvis (uterus, ovaries) to rule out any stone lodged in urinary tract. Although your urine routine shows no pus cells but you get a culture done, it will identify the causative organism. Then you should start antimicrobial like Nitrofurantoin or other medicine to which the bacteria is sensitive. I have cranberry juice and plenty of fluids.

The next day it stung quite a bit, and when I urinated, it was painful to sit down. I inspected my vulva with a mirror and found a tear or rip at the base of my vulva. I searched, and I think it is at the posterior fourchette. It is 10 days since this, and there is no longer pain and discharge or bleeding. However, I can still see the tear, it is red. How long should it be before this seals over and should I avoid having sex until it does? Also, how common is it for this to happen, and will it happen every time I have sex?","Doctor":"Hi. According to the history given by you, apart from a vaginal tear, the following reasons can also cause similar symptoms: 1. Firstly, women can bleed post-sex if intercourse is done soon after the periods, but this does not cause pain. 2. Secondly, virgin girls can bleed initially for a few times. 3. Lastly, intercourse done without proper arousal or foreplay makes the vagina less lubricate, causing pain and bleeding. You should visit a gynecologist for a detailed examination because sometimes tears can be deep-seated and be missed causing future problems."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a problem with my teeth.

Using Chlorhexidine mouthwash for more than 15 days in continuation causes brownish discoloration, that is the reason your teeth are becoming brownish. Now that you have developed chlorhexidine discoloration, I do not think scaling will be of any use. Instead, I would suggest you for either bleaching or veneering.

When he was around sixteen months, he could say thank you, stop, mama, daddy, and even his sister's name. At about nineteen months he was diagnosed with an ear infection. The infection was treated, but there was fluid that probably remained for approximately six months without our knowledge. We found out only after he started to speak less and less. His eardrums were retracting, but he now has tubes and can hear fine. However, he still does not speak. He points, looks are in the eyes, cuddles, smiles, kisses, does gestures, loves other kids and can retrieve items if we point to them, but sometimes it seems like he does not understand.

It is possible that ear infection or glue ear hampered your child's hearing which in turn could have impaired his normal speech and language development. With support, he will be able to catch up if everything else is normal. It is advisable to continue with speech and language therapy input.

I suffered from anxiety a debilitating one, and after trying many SSRI, nothing worked except Effexor SNRI, which reduced the stress. Now the problem is that I have no libido and sex drive and all the associated issues. The psychiatrists in my place that I see insist that it is not from the medicine and it is from me. And this thing is annoying, so what can I do to solve this problem also Wellbutrin is not sold in my place.","Doctor":"Hello. You may be aware that SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and SNRIs (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) like Effexor are good at managing anxiety, but it can cause sexual side effects in some people. As your local psychiatrists said, it is also typical for the low libido to be related to anxiety and depressed mood as well. Was your libido normal before you went on Effexor? If lowering of libido is directly related to commencing Effexor, one option is to try a lower dose and see whether anxiety is controlled and libido improves. Another option will be to switch to mirtazapine which has a lower tendency to cause sexual side effects. I will recommend discussing with your psychiatrist, as you will need to be monitored while making any medication changes. Also, have had CBT for anxiety? It will help you in managing stress when medication is eventually tapered off."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am a 57-year-old female. Here is my question constant heart palpitations and fluttering, continuous feeling of adrenaline rushing along with palpitations very bad at night but also during the day when sitting in doing nothing palpitations often make you feel nauseous on a 1 to 10 scale they are about an eight. All labs are normal ECG, echo, and Holter monitor are all normal.Doctor cannot figure it out and prescribed Propranolol 10 mg, told me to try these once a day. Yesterday after doctor visits heart palpitations for four hours got fed up and took one tablet one hour later, all palpitations and adrenaline rush was gone. Slept for the first time without being woke up having to cough to stop the palpitations. Had angio done approximately two years ago due to suspected heart attack or arrhythmia at home with all classic signs crushing chest pain jaw neck left arm down to the floor nauseated?Even with that lab test came back good the next day. Had carotid artery surgery two years ago to remove a piece of plaque in right carotid artery none found anywhere else no stent needed. Again all labs are good cholesterol not high on statins and warfarin. I must be perplexing to all doctors because they cannot figure it out. Was put on warfarin approximately 15 years ago due to DVTs as a result of a surgery, always therapeutic. So I had a heart attack or arrhythmia a few years back the angio came out the great doctor said everything looked fine now I have these crazy heart palpitations that would not stop. They go away as soon as I take the beta-blocker. I am told that beta-blockers even though anti-arrhythmic can also be pro arithmetic as well should I take this every day or should I only take this when I start to feel palpitations.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to ciliniq.com. So palpitations may be due to cardiac arrhythmia, anxiety, and psychological problems or due to increased awareness of one's heartbeat. Now, since your holter was normal during your palpitations, it rules out the possibility of cardiac arrhythmia. So, these are likely benign palpitations in you. Propranolol is an anti-anxiety medicine, and it also opposes the Adrenaline rush due to psychological causes. It is not an antiarrhythmic drug per, and it is not arrhythmogenic like other antiarrhythmics. So, there is no harm in having it regularly. It should be taken regularly for a few weeks and later on tapered as symptoms start reducing. Only things to be monitored are BP and pulse rate, which may be reduced due to propranolol on higher doses. I hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 27 years old, with no chronic health diseases. For the past six months, I have had erection problems.

Anyways the pictures which you have sent me to show that there is a bit of swelling around the wrist region, but x-rays are required, and clinical images alone are not sufficient. The only thing which I was going across is that you have sustained three or four fractures in the past six years which if there is no significant history of trauma in previous episodes, needs further evaluation, but if there was a history of significant injury then its fine. As for the present condition, I would like to state that in patients with healthy bone metabolism and no underlying pathology, there should not be any fracture without a history of any significant trauma at your age.

Gentle anti-inflammatory medication like Ibuprofen, Paracetamol, etc., can be used for pain relief on SOS basis. 3. Ice packs should be used three to four times in a day, 10 to 15 minutes every time to keep swelling and pain to bare minimum.

It is good that you are trying taper off Ativan (Lorazepam) as long term use is not advisable due to physical and psychological dependence. You have already managed to cut down from 2 mg daily to 1.5 mg daily which is a positive step forward. Did you have any withdrawal symptoms at that time? You can try to taper very gradually to minimize withdrawal symptoms. For example, try taking 0.75 mg in the morning and 0.5 mg in the afternoon for about a month. If there are any significant withdrawal symptoms at any stage, go back to the original dose. If you are able to tolerate, then cut down to 0.5 mg twice daily for a month. Then cut down to 0.5 mg in the morning and 0.25 mg in the afternoon for a month and so on. In this manner you should be able to wean off completely by 5 to 6 months. If it is not possible to taper down safely, you may need rehabilitation therapy and medically assisted detox.

But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

Do I have an ear infection?","Doctor":"Hello. As per the details you have provided, there seems to be an infection. The location of it is most probably the ear (especially the outer part called auricle and external auditory canal). To be sure you must consult an ENT specialist who will examine the ear, nose and throat and arrive at a diagnosis. He will thereafter prescribe the right medicines for you. However, I emphasize the need to show an ENT specialist as soon as you can. Secondarily it can also be arthralgia of the temporomandibular joint because of an infective cause. Also, severe nose and throat infection can cause such problems too. If left unattended, it can result in complications like ear discharge, further enlargement of the nodes and pain, the spread of infection to surrounding areas, etc. Hence please avail the services of an ENT specialist to avoid any unwanted complications. I hope you get better soon."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, From last two to three days I am feeling some pressure on my left side chest, and my left hand is also paining a bit, and when I eat food, I feel that I am not able to breathe and a bit pain on the left side of the chest, please help.","Doctor":"Hello. If you are having recurrent chest pressure and chest pain at rest and also after eating food, this may be a very well be a symptom of heart pain and, hence, I would recommend you to visit a hospital to get an ECG and Troponin I blood test is done soon. If both of these are normal, we may be dealing with either non-cardiac condition or mild heart pain or attack. To distinguish these two, there are various types of tests available, the most common being a treadmill test. Your cardiologist can decide appropriate next test based on detailed history and ECG or blood test results. So, for now, I would recommend you to go to a hospital to be checked. I hope this solves your query."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My son has an ear infection, with some discharge. Our local GP tested the discharge and found evidence of several bugs, prescribing Otomize ear spray (Neomycin, Dexamethasone, Acetic Acid). He wears hearing aids, and at his last audiology appointment (three months ago) there was evidence of perforation. The GP examined his ear and could see no evidence of a hole, although we have previously had conflicting information from the GP and audiology about the existence of a perforation. I have reservations about using the Otomize spray as I have read that it is ototoxic, but I am concerned that the infection will cause more damage if left untreated. Should we proceed with the spray?","Doctor":"Hello. If there is a perforation or even the slightest doubt of it, Neomycin in the optimize spray can enter the middle ear and pass through round window membrane and cause permanent damage to the inner ear and thereby sensorineural hearing loss. Hence that spray is best avoided. You may instill dull Ciprofloxacin ear or eye drops in the said ear. Two drops twice daily. If the ENT has put an otoscope and categorically ruled out an ear perforation, then we need not worry. For our sake, why do not you ask him to put an otoendoscope inside the ear and show the drum in screen and assuage all our fears regarding a hole in the drum?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am on regular birth control pills and was taking these as usual. I took the seven inactive pills and began taking the active pills. I took it for three nights as per schedule but forgot to take it on the fourth. And I had sex on the same night, with a condom, but there may have been sperm near my vagina afterward. At about 10 AM on the next day, I took the missed pill. That afternoon I vomited. Soon after this, I took an emergency contraceptive pill and continued the other active pills as usual. Considering these factors, are chances of pregnancy high?","Doctor":"Hello. How are you doing? You are absolutely safe and there is no chance of pregnancy. Let me explain. Birth control pills act by creating a continuous constant hormonal level. They prevent the normal hormonal fluctuations. So, ovulation will not occur. Only if you miss two or more tablets, the hormonal suppression will be lost and there will be a chance of pregnancy, especially if you miss it during the second half of the cycle. So, I do not see any chance of pregnancy in the present scenario. You have not missed a pill too, as you have taken the missed pill within 12 hours. The vomiting was only two to four hours later and not immediately. So, the hormonal suppression is not lost.The emergency pill was not required to be taken. This pill will delay the periods by one or two weeks. Hope I have clarified your query. Do write back. All the best.

I woke up after an hour of sleep with shortness of breath and numbness in my right arm. I have been suffering from a cold, for a week now. Five days ago I boarded a flight, I got congested during the first leg of the flight, and got no sleep. On the second leg after dozing off briefly, I woke up feeling numb in my arms, particularly the right arm, and shortness of breath that quickly spiraled into extreme shortness of breath, a racing heart, and hot flushes. The airline crew placed me on oxygen for the remaining two hours of the flight. My blood pressure was on the higher side and pulse came back fine as well. When I landed, the airport clinic gave me Amoxicillin and checked my vitals, and they were stable, so they released me. After two nights of difficult or no sleep, I went to a hospital, where my blood pressure was138/93 mmHg. So, the doctor prescribed me a Pseudoephedrine and Paracetamol, to take along with the Amoxicillin. I have been taking them every 8 hours as prescribed, and they appear to be helping. They performed an EKG and found nothing wrong. This brings me to the current problem. I am still experiencing difficulty in sleeping even with the medication. I managed to doze off for an hour first thing last night but woke up with shortness of breath and my right arm numb. I was sleeping on my back and did not roll on the arm. I recovered and tried for several hours to fall back to sleep. Why is only my arm going numb? Is it deprived of oxygen due to the cold? If so, why not other limbs too? I am normally a snorer, so I figured that the chest congestion is leaving me short of breath. Any thoughts on this, and what else can I do?","Doctor":"Hi. I would give my opinion regarding this, but it may not be the final diagnosis as I have not examined you. Shortness of breath after lying down for an hour implies there is a pulmonary congestion, that is pooling of blood in lungs due to weakened heart. It is called orthopnea, which is a sign of heart disease. The likely cause could be a viral myocarditis, as you have had a recent journey to a new place.  Also, this can be possible in a patient with asthma, even though the probability is low. Coming to the arm pain, it cannot be explained with the cause mentioned above. There can be a local pathology or a compression near the shoulder to the brachial plexus. I suggest you get a chest x-ray, echocardiogram, and ECG (electrocardiography). If possible, I want to see the ECG, as it is very tricky to interpret the ECG.

In approximately 70% cases, we may not be able to identify any specific cause for seizures, for example - infection, stroke, focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and tumor, as in your case. Sinusitis is an incidental finding and at present it seems to be unrelated to epilepsy. You should complete antibiotic course as prescribed for its coverage. For epilepsy, he will need antiepileptic drugs (AED). There are many AED to choose from, but once you have been given Keppra (Levetiracetam) you can continue the same, as it is a new generation drug with minimal side effects and drug interaction. With the limited information I have, I would recommend starting it to prevent future seizures. Your neurologist can provide you with its optimal dosing. High white blood cell (WBC) could be related to sinusitis or as a transient rise from seizure itself. It should come down by itself.

About 38 days before I had sex with a CSW (Commercial Social Worker). It was protected vaginal sex and protected oral sex. Also there were deep throat kisses which lasted almost a minute. I am not sure if the condom was torn during the intercourse. Since last 3 weeks I have sore throat and mild joint pain. No real fever. Sometimes during afternoon time, my body temperature raises up to 37.2 degrees centigrade. The sore throat was mild but was a one pin point like feeling. The phlegm had blood stains. Phlegm was green or yellow in color. I went to the doctor and he checked chest x-ray and found no problem. I tested HIV 3rd Generation antibody test after 19 days of exposure, which was negative. My questions: Are my symptoms related to Acute Retroviral Syndrome (ARS)? Is there any possibility for transmission of HIV through deep kissing? What can be the cause for blood stained phlegm? An ENT specialist had told me that the partition of my nose is a little bent. Is there any relation of this and my symptoms? I am feeling a little weak but I think this is mostly because of anxiety. How accurate is my 19 days HIV test result? Can sore throat without fever can be a symptom of ARS? I have only sore throat and very mild joint and muscle pain and that too not constant.","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Based upon your history, my answer to your questions: 1. Are My Symptoms Related to ARS? Acute Retroviral Syndrome (ARS) typically begins 7-14 days after the exposure to a HIV positive patient, and may last for up to 3-4 months. The symptoms are typically \\"flu-like\\" with fever (may be high grade or low grade), fatigue, headache, aching muscles or joints, sore throat, swollen lymph glands and sometimes a maculopapular rash. Now, this is simply a description of ARS, this does not prove that you have it!!!!! Let me dissect this issue a little closely for you:a) The failure rate of condoms may be up to 5%, and since you are not sure of it being torn, there is a definite likelihood that it may have ruptured. However that still does not ensure you acquiring the infection. Because HIV acquisition has so many issues - the CSW in question should be positive and more likely to spread it if she had symptomatic AIDS with high viral titres. Thus, there is no way of accurately assessing your risk of acquisition of the infection. I would recommend that instead of teasing your mind about \\"YES\\" or \\"NO\\", get the tests done (mentioned below) to get over your anxiety.b) Though your symptoms are similar to ARS, by all means these are also the symptoms of the following diseases. So, unless we get the tests done, we may not be sure. There are other STDs (Sexually Transmitted Diseases) related, that have a similar clinical picture . \\"Herpetic gingivostomatitis and pharyngitis\\" (caused by Herpes Simplex Virus, a sexually transmittable disease), and rarely \\"gonococcal pharyngitis\\" (another STD, in which urethral pus filled discharge is additionally, but not always seen along with sore throat). The third possiblity is of course a \\"normal viral fever\\" caused by simple viruses like adenovirus, coronaviruses etc., which may transmit from anyone to anyone, simply due to kissing. Let us hope you have the last type of fever that subsides without any complications.Your picture is non-specific and does not suggest any infection related condition. 2. Is There Any Possibility for Transmission of HIV Through Deep Kissing? Kissing per se is not known to transmit HIV, except for few doubtful cases reported in medical literature. Of course \\"deep throat kissing\\" may have a little higher risk. The possibility will depend on the HIV status of the CSW. 3. What Can be the Cause For Blood Stained Phlegm? If you have been trying to clear your throat vigorously to get rid of the phlegm, the severe blows on the throat may also lead to mildly blood-tinged sputum. The other cause may be Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, commonly seen in patients with HIV-AIDS. However, it is just a rare possibility. 4. An ENT specialist had told me that the partition of my nose is a little bent. Is there any relation of this and my symptoms? ENT specialist may have diagnosed DNS (Deviated Nasal Septum). It might be a cause for recurrent sinusitis and occasional epistaxis (bleeding from the nose), none of which is your primary symptom. So it seems to be totally unrelated. 5. I am feeling a little weak but I think this is mostly because of anxiety.  Weakness may be a part of the viral fever which you have, with additional component of anxiety induced lethargy. No harm in taking Giloy Amla Juice twice a day (10 ml) and tablet Septilin twice a day for a month. Get your Complete Blood Count (CBC) and Liver Function Test (LFT) done. In addition get serological tests for hepatitis B and hepatitis C done. Very few people know that the possibility of transmission of these infections along with or even without HIV is decently high in sexual encounters. 6. How accurate is my 19 days HIV test result? It takes up to 12-16 weeks for HIV antibodies to become detectable by ELISA test. Thus your HIV ELISA test, though being accurate (depending on the lab you got it done), is still not an indication. It simply suggests that you are not \\"seropositive\\" for HIV at present. A repeat test of HIV ELISA, 3 months after the day of intercourse and then once again at the 6th month is the standard practice of confirming or ruling it out. However, in today's era we have early diagnosing blood tests which may detect HIV infection even before ELISA turns positive. These tests include: So I will advise you to get the above tests done to have the peace of your mind.If at all (God forbid!), your report for ARS comes positive, there are Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapies (HAART) available, which may be started soon after the tests detect the infection. The details of that may be discussed in our next consultation once I have your reports. But do not lose hope, because modern medicine is capable of salvaging your condition (and all this is based on the premise of you having ARS, which has not even been proven!!!). 7. Can sore throat without fever can be a symptom of ARS? I have only sore throat and very mild joint and muscle pain and that too not constant. I have answered this query for you in the discussion above. The Final List of Tests to be Done: 1) For HIV-ARS: 2) For related STDs: 3) General Tests - CBC, LFT.

Your upper back pain and left sided chest pain might be due to a condition called cervical radiculopathy. It is a condition where the nerves at your neck level get compressed between the neck bones and causes pain in the back of neck or upper back or arm or shoulder or hand or chest. For the diagnosis of this condition you need to get an MRI cervical spine done. Till then do slow rotational exercise of neck.  Now coming to your giddiness, drowziness and unsteadiness while walking, this needs evaluation. It could be due to inner ear problems, vitamin B12 deficiency or brain problems.

Why am I experiencing bleeding and discomfort after being fingered? I am currently taking Lamotrigine and Adderall.","Doctor":"Hello. Have you noticed the bleeding while you urinate also? Or else only after fingering? In view of your past episodes of UTI (urinary tract infection) it seems the same has recurred again as suggested by the pain after urinating. On top of that since women's urethral opening and the vagina are very near fingering might spread the infection there also and some injury during the fingering might have caused the bleeding. Please take the following medications, and refrain from fingering and sexual activity until the pain, bleeding and UTI subsides. Meanwhile, do the following test to confirm urinary infection. Also, please attach the previous prescription where Lamotrigine and Adderall were prescribed. Do you have discharge per vagina and pain during intercourse as well?

Can you prescribe any medicine for this?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, the problems you are facing are most likely related to long-term side effects of the drug Fluoxetine. Mild headaches and sweating are known side effects intrinsic to Fluoxetine. Usually this drug is tolerated by most patients only at the lowest effective dose. Also studies have shown that Fluoxetine exaggerates pre-existing restless legs syndrome (RLS) in many patients.

I have done a ton of research on the internet regarding this subject and probably know as much as anyone can know based solely on internet information. So I am hoping someone with a more advanced knowledge of this toxin can give me some information. Here is my story: I recently worked on a project involving sanded grout that contains high amounts of crystalline silica (40 -70%). Unfortunately I inhaled a substantial amount without realizing the contents of grout and the effects of silica until further research after the project. This was not an ordinary project. I am a photographer and this was a photo shoot at a studio. We used it as powder and threw it in the air to capture the dust clouds in the photos. When we purchased this, it did not even cross our minds how dangerous it was. I poured 3, 25 lbs bags (totally 75 lbs) of polyblend sanded grout on the floor and stood at about 8 feet distance away from the model. She (the model) grabbed handfuls of this stuff and tossed it towards the camera and in other different directions. The grout was tossed in the air towards me throughout the shoot. The air was quite cloudy in the room regardless of the size. I tossed the grout in front of me several times with my bare hands as well. But, I did not have problems of breathing or talking in the room. The shoot lasted for 2 hours and we stayed to clean up for 2 hours afterwards (sweeping). It was 75 pounds of sanded grout and 100 pounds of mortar in a 2100 square feet room with a little fan blowing and with little ventilation. The dust got on everything and the air was thick with dust the entire time. We had about 3-4 hours of exposure to this with no masks. My ignorance has put a huge scare on me. I have been feeling shortness of breath, throat irritation and tightening of the chest. I have been doing some thorough research myself, but the amount of silica inhaled to be considered high concentration (enough to cause lung cancer or silicosis years from now) is a little unclear. Is the amount which I have mentioned, with no respiratory mask, dangerous? I have read that these tiny particles can penetrate through the defenses of the lung and start scarring it in the long run. I have also read that it is possible to have acute silicosis through a single lethal exposure to crystalline silica. I know too much research is bad for a hypochondriac like me, but I would like some honest and thorough explanation of my chances on these long term lung issues. I have attached the details of the polyblend sanded grout and its safety data sheet. After 3 weeks from the shoot, I have been experiencing chest pains, shortness of breath and dry cough. I have had chest x-rays, EKG's and visited urgent care doctors. Everything came back as normal, so I am not sure of what is going on. Instead I was diagnosed with sinus infection and acid reflux causing stomach pain as well. I have requested the doctor to do a PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). I have not been able to eat or sleep properly and I have been worrying about this.","Doctor":"Hello. I have surfed your links and understood your problem in detail.

Many commonly used drugs like Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) have also been implicated in SJS. So if you notice any fever, skin rash, and blisters after taking the medication, the stop it immediately and seek medical help. If you are feeling anxious about this rare side effect, then another option will be not to take Modafinil. You can try healthy caffeinated drinks which are also effective stimulants and help during course work. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have had numbness in my toes for approximately three months. Sometimes there is a little bit of tingling along with it. It has not affected the activity or my way of life. I also have backache and a lot of degeneration in the back. I am on Levothyroxine, Rouvostatin, and Aspirin. Occasionally I take Xanax for anxiety. Also, I had ankle surgery before four months on my right ankle, and this is the second surgery on that ankle. The numbness and tingling started just around that time. I also drank wine. I can drink anywhere from two to four glasses a day, but there have been many times when I go without alcohol for months at a time. I am getting very anxious about this, and I understand there are many many causes for numbness and tingling and that it can be very progressive. I would like to know if my liver enzymes are normal, is it possible to have alcohol neuropathy?","Doctor":"Hello. I would ask you whether your problem of numbness on feet is only restricted to the operated ankle or it is on both feet? Moreover, you seem to be drinking time almost every day be restricted slowly. Alcoholic neuropathy is bilateral, and if you have on both legs, you need to stop drinking and start taking Vitamin B12 500 microgram twice a day. Regarding your back problem, if there is radiating pain, you could worry about degenerative disorders. What sort of surgery did you undergo? They are the possibility of post-surgery injury of sensory nerve ending damage which could explain our problem also. Well, I would say, if you stop drinking, your liver will be fine. Post surgery Nil Alcoholic neuropathy"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My husband is a 30-year-old. Last week, he went to the gym the first time after a year and did heavy biceps exercise with high repetitions. After two days, his arms were swollen, and he was not able to make his arms straight. Yesterday we consulted with a nephrologist, and he told to do tests for CPK and serum creatinine. The CPK level was 15850 which is very scary to us, and when the doctor saw reports, he said that it is a muscle breakdown but did not tell us to have an IV therapy and asked to drink lot and lot of water. We are quite worried about the kidney failure thing and wanted to know that is there really no need to admit in the hospital? Symptoms, 1. After a day of rough biceps exercise, arms were stiff and swelling, which has resolved 40 % by now. 2. Urine is clear, and the color is almost like water. The average urinate time is 10 to 15 seconds. 3. No other symptoms of pain other than both hands which have a dull ache. His report says, Yesterday CPK was 15850 and creatinine was .96. Today it was 15400 and Creatinine was .86 My question is, should we get IV, or it will it decrease over time? How is his kidney doing?","Doctor":"Hello. My opinion is that he should be admitted to the hospital. Good that he has enough urine output so far. But it can decrease any time, and kidney functions will start to drop. The best is to admit him for close intravenous hydration and daily monitoring of kidney functions and CPK (creatine phosphokinase). Also to guard against high potassium hazards. Rhabdomyolysis.

Please suggest foods to increase weight, immunity, and fertility. Kindly advise.","Doctor":"Hi. How is your eating habits? Your total calorie intake should be around 2200 cal/day. This will include all three meals with a snack in the evening. You can drink any protein supplements at that time. Include ghee two to three teaspoons a day. Cheese or paneer weekly thrice. Exercise every day for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Simplest is brisk walking. Your appetite will increase with exercises. All fruits and vegetables are allowed. Take milkshakes, lassi, protein supplements after your exercise. All kinds of dals and whole pulses are allowed. Whenever you are eating high protein diet follow that by light food. For example, if you are eating channa for breakfast, eat a light lunch. Gradually increase your intake. If you follow my diet, definitely your immune system will become good. Weight gain will happen slowly. Meditation is good for psychological problems. Concentrate on positive things in life. Do not worry too much about your weight.

Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. CT KUB (kidneys, ureter, and bladder) is 95% accurate to diagnose urinary stones. Usually, stones form in the kidney and drop down the ureter causing extreme pain due to stretch of the renal capsule. Since your right kidney is blocked, I need to check on your kidney functions by doing a blood test called creatinine level, especially if you have other medical problems like diabetes or hypertension. I also want to make sure you do not have urinary infections after this if kidney functions are normal and no infection then we can try medical therapy for 4-6 weeks with capsule Tamsulosin (Contiflo) 0.4 mg at night daily for six weeks the possibility of passing the stone is 25%. If you need more urgent treatment with a 70% stone clearance rate will be shock wave lithotripsy. If you got pain again in spite of medication or you got high creatinine level then endoscopic ureteroscopy DJ stent will be the best first-line option. On follow up after treatment you need needs calcium level, phosphate, and uric acid. I hope this helps. Creatinine, urine analysis, and culture. Hydration lemon and orange fresh juices.

Well, I do not know the particulars of your case, it sounds as if you may have what is called a Bartholin’s cyst. This represents inflammation of the glandular structure in the perianal area in women. It is generally benign but can be very painful and uncomfortable. Try sitting in a warm tub with warm water several times a day or applying warm compresses to the area such as a warm cloth for about 15 minutes and as it may bring down the inflammation. If that does not work then you should probably see a local doctor who has other methods of bringing down the inflammation including the use of antibiotics."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I got my wisdom teeth pulled before four days, the very next day I throw up due to antibiotics. An hour later, a piece of tissue was hanging on the upper right clotted socket, is this normal?","Doctor":"Hello. The situation which you described is entirely normal. The area surrounding the wisdom tooth gets usually inflamed, which is known as pericoronitis. After the removal of the area around the socket, which is the gingival (gum) tissue undergoes healing. The piece of tissue which you mentioned is the gum tissue undergoing healing. The socket will take about a month to close completely.

Bloody diarrhea and diarrhea eventually went away. I am feeling a lot better now. However, some symptoms concern me. My stomach and intestines keep making gurgling and growling noises. They are more noticeable at night when I sleep. They also occur before I have a bowel movement sometimes. I sometimes notice small amounts of blood and mucus in my stool. Blood is present in small quantities, not as much as when I had bloody diarrhea. Blood is on and off. Mucus is present in small amounts as well. My stool also does not look quite normal. There are undigested food particles in my stool, and I normally do not have that. Sometimes it is green or greenish-yellow. No other symptoms are present. Appetite and weight are good and no fatigue. Would blood and mucus in stool signify Crohn's or ulcerative colitis especially with the bowel noises? I am under age 30, so I don't feel at risk for cancer or polyps. What do you think I most likely have?","Doctor":"Hello. See following an infection of Intestine (that is what you had initially), and there occurs some damage to the digestive and absorptive capacity of the Intestine. This leads to indigestion and malabsorption of food that you consume. But the presence of blood is of bit concern. It may indicate either a repeat Infection or Crohn's or Ulcerative colitis. However, there will be a long duration of the problem in Crohn's or Ulcerative colitis, and they will be associated with pain abdomen rather than gurgling and growling noises. In my opinion, the chances of Infection is higher than Crohn's or ulcerative colitis. I would recommend you to get stool routine and stool culture sensitivity test done and revert with reports. These test will tell if there is an infection or not. I hope this information was useful for you. Any clarifications feel free to ask."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 4-year-old, son, has asthma, and he is coughing so much. He is continuously vomiting, but inhaler and nebulizer are not helping in this case. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. Asthma can be exacerbated with a lot of external factors, the external factor like dust, cold, hot climate, pollen's causes irritation and eventual inflammation in small airway resulting in obstruction of airways, as a result, difficult breathing and lot of expectorating. Kindly limit his contact with the allergen. Keep him well, hydrated. He needs to take bronchodilator or corticosteroid inhaler will help decrease inflammation, improve coughing aswell. Salbutamol cough syrup. Ondansetron will help to stop his vomiting. Also, there is so much advancement has been made in homeopathy treatment, and the medicine shows good response in patients. However, ideally, an X-ray should also be done to see if there is any superimposed chest infection if he has had a fever. I think the best will be to see a pediatrician if the condition is not improved.

I would suggest a single whole-body application of 5 % Permethrin cream from the neck downwards to the whole body, kept overnight for eight hours, followed by bath the next day. An OTC oral antihistamine, e.g. Cetirizine 10 mg once daily, will provide symptomatic relief from itching. Kids can take syrup Alerid (5mg/5ml) 1 tablespoon daily (Cetirizine). All the close contacts should be treated simultaneously in the same manner. Clothing, sheets, etc., should be washed thoroughly with hot water to prevent re-infection from clothing.

Then around three months later I tested for hepatitis B and C both, but the result was negative, but in LFT test my bilirubin was a little high, and I got a fatty liver grade one by the doctor. So I have the following questions that, 1. Can I get infected with hepatitis B and C in the future? 2. How can I overcome with high bilirubin? 3. My digestive system is also not as good as previous. 4. Will I suffer from any sexual infection in the future.","Doctor":"Hello doctor, A negative test for hepatitis B and C, three months after that unprotected anal sex rules these out as a cause for your hepatitis. Perhaps it was another cause for hepatitis, may be hepatitis A which is transmitted through contaminated food rather than by sex. Hepatitis B and C are transmitted through unprotected sex or blood, e.g. transfusion or sharing needles. So, these scenarios can pose a risk of hepatitis. For raised bilirubin, I suggest you consult a physician kindly. I also suggest you screen for hepatitis A. STDs can happen if you indulge in unprotected sex or sex with partners with high-risk behavior."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am 22 years old female, with 5'5\\" height and I weight 60.5 kg.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Also, she has been given two vitamin B12 vaccinations in the past four days. She has been complaining of mouth sores on her tongue and under the tongue, which prevents her from eating anything spicy.

In men the skeletal maturity (growth plate maturity) is attained at the age of 18 to 22 years after which bones cannot grow further. Hence, there is cessation of the vertical growth in humans.

I believe my tonsils are swollen, but it is hard to tell as my neck is so swollen and I cannot open my mouth that wide with it being too painful, and I am getting migraines due to this pain. Should I consult a doctor?","Doctor":"Hello. According to the symptoms you have mentioned in the query, you are having a severe acute exacerbation of chronic tonsillitis. 1) Pain in throat, difficulty in breathing and swallowing point towards an acute follicular tonsillitis. 2) Enlarged lymph nodes indicate this is not the first episode, but you might be facing this problem at regular intervals. This means this is a chronic condition. 3) Ear pain is a referred pain in your case. This means there is no local ear pathology or ear problem. The glossopharyngeal nerve (9th nerve) gives out branches to both ear and throat, so sometimes a pathology of the throat can lead to earache. My advice will be to visit an otolaryngologist in your town and have your throat examined. 1. Start on antibiotics, Amoxycillin plus Clavulanic acid combination tablet (625 mg) or you can try Cefuroxime plus Clavulanic acid (500 mg) to be taken twice daily for five days. 2. Analgesics are important to relieve pain and swelling. Diclofenac or Aceclofenac tablets with Paracetamol twice daily after meals is a good option. 3. An antacid should be taken along with analgesics since Analgesics can lead to gastric irritation. 4. Warm saline gargles with Betadine three to four times a day provide a soothing effect. If you are suffering from such episodes more than three to four times per year, it is advisable to get your tonsils removed by surgery, ie tonsillectomy done. If the disease is not responding to the above treatment, I will advise you to get an investigation called throat swab done by your doctor."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,After I ate something, I am getting a feeling (maybe real) that something is stuck in my throat. I drank a lot of water, but it is still there. Why?","Doctor":"Hello. 1) Generally, small pieces of food stuck in the throat will dissolve on their own by being exposed to saliva from mouth. You can wait for this to happen if the symptom is not troublesome. Chewing gums or lozenges increase salivary production. 2) Since the symptom is persisting even after drinking a lot of water, try to initiate the gag reflex. To do this tickle the back of your mouth where the soft palate ends with your finger. This reverses the process of normal swallowing and helps to regurgitate food stuck in esophagus back towards the mouth. 3) If the feeling persists and if it is without any irritation or pain, it may be a false sensation called globus hystericus. This is due to the stretching effect of the muscles of the esophagus while swallowing a large bolus of food. But to confirm whether the feeling is false, you need to visit a hospital and get an endoscopy done. 4) If there is a lot of irritation or pain, you need to go to the hospital and have it removed by an endoscope. An endoscope is a long, thin camera using which doctor can see the piece of food which is stuck and remove it."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have a newborn of three weeks old.

Since you are facing problems with it, you can give expressed breast milk with a spoon. Never use a bottle. You need to take extra calories while lactating drink enough fluids so that you secrete more milk. About formula milk use only if you are not secreting enough milk. You try to direct breastfeed as much as possible then give EBM (evidence-based medicine) still not enough you can try formula, but do not use a feeding bottle.

I have recently had a long journey (approximately 10 hours, with stops every three hours) the sensation has lasted for about a week. I am not on any medication or have any health conditions. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. This may be due to your long journey where all your joints will be flexed for quite a long time inspire of the rest you had in between. If it is in a bike, your lower spine has also been flexed, which will cause a small inconvenience to the nerves which pass through the foramen of the spine. It simply may due to a vitamin deficiency, or be due to disc problem. Rule out any disc problem, see an orthopedic surgeon, do a spinal MRI.

I recently went to my doctor because I lost some of my hearing, and I have been having pains in my right ear. My doctor told me that the ear drum healed but there is a lot of scarring on it. Why is my eardrum hurting if it is improved?","Doctor":"Hello. 1) A ruptured eardrum, if not infected, is not a serious condition as it will usually heal by itself within 6 to 8 weeks. It is a skin-like structure, and it heals like a skin that is cut heals. In your case, you had a perforation in the eardrum seven years back, and since then you have not had ear discharge, there is a high possibility that the eardrum has healed. 2) The doctor you have visited must have done an otoscopic examination of your eardrum (looking into the ear canal with a lighted, magnifying instrument called otoscope). Scarring of the drum is called tympanosclerosis. It occurs due to calcification if the tissues in the eardrum and middle ear. If extensive, it may involve your hearing apparatus (chain of small bones for hearing) and affect hearing. I will advise you to get an investigation for a hearing called pure tone audiometry. This will give a clue about the degree and hearing loss. Treatment for hearing loss whether it can be cured by surgery or you need to use a hearing aid will depend on the reports of audiometry. 3) Causes for earache can be, 1. Infection of the ear canal outside the eardrum (otitis externa). 2. Eczema of the ear canal (seborrhoeic dermatitis). 3. New infection of the eardrum (acute otitis media). 4. Any dental or throat infections. The cause for earache can be diagnosed only after a full ENT examination. Kindly request your doctor for a microscopic examination of your ear canal apart from an otoscopic examination as it provides a better magnification and one can visualize even the fine details. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother is 68 years old.

Her X-ray shows only each lung is 35 % white shading rest looks black. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. After going through your history, it is obvious that your mother is suffering from IPF (UIP). She is taking Ivepred 10 and Lumenac 600 mg for the last two years. Swelling on face and legs could be because of the steroid side effects as she is on long term Ivepred. You said her X-ray shows white shadows and her PFT is within normal limits. For your information, IPF is a chronic progressive lung disease. Though she is started on Tab, Pirfenex it will not convert the fibrosed lung to normal. It is only to save the remaining lung from further damage (Fibrosis). Now the question is can she take Lumenac and pirfenex together. Yes, She can take both the tablets together. Next issue is about her saturation. As the damaged lung is not capable of coping up ventilation, her baseline resting saturation is remaining good, but on exertion, it is getting down because of decreased lung function due to fibrosis. The only way to maintain saturation throughout any activity is to supplement oxygen from outside.It should be given two lpm to maintain saturation above 90 %. Intermittently it should be checked in the hospital by doing ABG that is arterial blood gas. Overall she should continue tablet Pirfenex (Pirfenadone) and Lumenac (Acetylcysteine and supplemental oxygen as required.

I want to know which test did you do to check Hepatitis C? If this was a high quantitative PCR test and if it was negative, then you are completely safe. If it was antibody test, and was negative, then I suggest to confrim with quantitative HCV PCR test. The antibody response to HCV viral infection is slow, hence a negative antibody tests does not confirm absence of infection. Means it can be falsely negative. Quantitative HCV PCR if negative then it can confirmly rule out the infection. For example if you were exposed, then PCR test can come positive as earliest as 1 to 2 weeks.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Liposuction.  2. Abdominoplasty.  3. Liposuction and abdominoplasty. 4. Body contouring surgeries. It depends on what you want. Every surgery has its pros and cons.

My problem is that I am suffering from lower lung pain on the left side for the past 10 days. I already consulted a doctor, but he was not able to find anything abnormal in X-ray and blood reports. He prescribed me some capsules and pain killers, but it does not work. It is getting worse when I take a deep breath or sneeze. It is a pinpoint pain in the left lower lungs. Please suggest me something so that I can cure my problem.","Doctor":"Hello. As you said, you had left chest pain for 10 days, and all reports are normal, it is very difficult to interpret it. You should elaborate your history in detail, including your history or similar episodes in the past. Attach the x-ray with your query. If you are having some acidity issues, it can be because of gastritis. You have not specified any other symptoms like cough, history of fall or any trauma in your description. So I advise you to get back to me with all these details. Most of the time, it is because of costochondritis which gets relieved with common pain killer tablets like tablet Combiflam 1-0-1 (Ibuprofen, Paracetamol) for five days after food. Even it is related with your menses also and very common in young girls. So a good correlation of your medical history will solve your problem."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Due to accident, I have an injury in my arm, and stone has entered in armpit now the stone is taken out, and the doctor has recommended me not to have dressing. If I will not having dressing, then I could lead to infection. Can you please help me what I should do now?","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen the picture you have attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity), and it looks like it is still a raw wound, that recently happened and has not got time to heal. It is best to leave such injuries over the skin open with an ointment applied over it such as Soframycin (Framycetin) or Bactroban (Mupirocin) so that you avoid infection while you are exposed to the outside environment. But while you are at home, wash your arm and then clean using Dettol or any antiseptic over the area and keep it dry uncovered. The reason we advise to leave it uncovered is that it will expose the epidermis and the body will realise it needs to heal the wound if the skin is torn. But if you apply a packing over it, the antibiotic in the dressing keeps the body's natural healing away and makes it slower. I understand it is challenging to keep it exposed and uncomfortable, but it is best for quicker healing."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I started growing hair on my neck when I was about 12, and since then I have pulled the hairs out with my finger, dug the skin with my nails to get the hairs out of the bumps, used razors and also tweezers. Now my skin looks horrible is scarred up pretty mad. I am embarrassed at how my neck seems to be a woman. The hairs grow so much, and I get hair bumps as well. I want to clear my skin up, so it does not look all bump and scard.","Doctor":"Hello. You have a case of pseudofolliculitis barbae, although a term reserved for male beard condition, you got it because of tampering and ill hair removing practices. Treatment includes manual correction of ingrown hair (visit your dermatologist) under magnification. Your hairs have changed their direction due to pulling. Once pulled out, they will grow normally and will not cause redness and bumps within the skin. Go for laser hair removal, which will take care of both hair growth as well as ingrown hair. Make sure it is a laser and not an IPL (intense pulse light) device. Things can be normal if you start following the right path. I hope this answers your query."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My three months baby is avoiding breast while feeding. Is there any other option to make her drink breast milk without direct feeding?","Doctor":"Hello. You can express breast milk (either manually or by using a breast pump) and give that milk to the baby using a spoon. But the reason for avoiding breastfeeding needs to be evaluated. Nose block is a common cause for refusal to feed. If the child is having a nose block, you can use Nasoclear drops two drops prior to each feed. You have mentioned the baby's current weight as 6 lbs, for a three months old baby 6 lbs fall much below the normal range. Was the child preterm? How much was the birth weight?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 84-year old stepfather had, apparently, two radical left-ear wall-up mastoidectomies in the late 50s and 60s. The second was done to fix the poor job done by the first at a county hospital for the indigent. Recently, caregivers said they were planing on using hydrogen peroxide in his left ear to clear much wax buildup. I learned of these surgeries from my step dad and from reviewing some ancient medical records. As his POA, I need to know of any dangers possible if hydrogen peroxide is administered in such an ear canal that, I understand, is permeable, and leads into his mastoid chamber.","Doctor":"Hello. As I understand, your father had undergone two ear surgeries when he was in his 30s or so. He would have either undergone canal wall up or canal wall down mastoidectomies. Radical and modified radical come under CWD, and cortical comes under CWU mastoidectomies. Anyways, hydrogen peroxide can be applied in his ear for wax removal if, 1. The ear has been disease-free for many months now, implying, there has been no ear discharge of pus or liquid. 2. No ear perforation, which would have presented with discharge and pain.  3. No raw area in the ear canal. The posterior canal is not permeable. In a wall down surgery after removing the wall, we close the defect with autologous cartilage or some material. Probably in his days, they may have left the cavity open. In either case, it gets lined by the skin, and that will be the case in your father also unless he has any disease or perforation. It is okay to use hydrogen peroxide to clear the wax if it does not come out using probe and otoscope or an endoscope. If an endoscope is put in the ear and under endoscope guidance wax be removed, then that is the best and safest. I hope I have answered your query. Revert to me in case you want any clarification."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been blessed with a baby girl last year. However, she is suffering from cloacal disease and has only one opening. Doctor has operated her and did way to pass the stools. She is not having her anal opening. During pregnancy, it has been observed that she does not have one kidney, she was not having properly developed back, etc. But it all recovered in 8th-month sonography. Is this a sign of the disease? Is it curable during pregnancy? Is it possible to avoid it before the birth of a child? I wanted to know.","Doctor":"Hello. I have read your question in detail, and I know that you are very concerned about your child. The absent anal opening is due to a congenital anomaly. Usually, when one congenital anomaly is present, there are chances that other congenital anomalies like absent kidney or cardiac defects are present. It is possible to detect these anomalies during level two scan done during 20 weeks of pregnancy. However, it is unfortunate that it cannot be treated during pregnancy. Medical science is still not that advance to cure these defects while the mother is pregnant. It is also not possible to avoid these kinds of anomalies before birth because these are rare defects and are not related to disease or environment. It is related to genes of mother and father. I hope this will help you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 21-year-old female with 5'7 height and 168 lbs in weight. I have a yellow bruise on the top of my areola.

I have no idea where it came from. But the itching is killing me it never stops.","Doctor":"Hello. A bruise is due to tissue bleeding and is usually bluish or bluish-red. It is never yellow. Moreover, a bruise is never itchy. Therefore the condition that you have is not a bruise, and it is something else.

However, within a few days, I noticed the same red spot on the upper part of my stomach (below my chest). When I looked to the rash in my back, it had doubled in size. Presenting a red or pink circle and was itchy. I immediately assumed it was ringworm and began to apply Lotrimin two times daily. However, within a week, the rash has now spread to my stomach area and onto my breasts. The itching has gone, but I am wondering if it could be a ringworm or pityriasis rosea?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, these are typical lesions of pityriasis rosea (attachment removed to protect identity). Annular plaques with scaly edges and free at the center.

She is very active, runs half marathons, and works out three to five times a week. She had broken her ankle, and we watched TV for two weeks and noticed some swelling. We took her to the doctor, and she had a DVT. She was also on birth control at the time. We have stopped birth control, and she did a regime of Xarelto. Now since the doctors have found out, she has these two mutations, they want to put her back on Xarelto for life. Is this a viable option? Can she be safe without the blood thinners? We believe the clot was due to the increase factors (birth control, break, and sedentary life). Do you think she needs blood thinners for life or she can take then at times of increased risk breaks, surgery, pregnancy, etc.?","Doctor":"Hello. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows, 1. Being positive for factor V Leiden and prothrombin is a considerable risk for thrombosis and is very much prone for thrombus formation in the future. This is very much common in homozygous inheritance individuals. 2. I do agree, OCP (rest could have been the cause. However, having associated other thrombosis risks with a history of thrombus (DVT) at present warrants indefinite anticoagulation therapy. 3. With the mutations in play, blood thinners are the safer choice. 4. However, if she is not keen on starting, in heterozygous patients, single thrombus should not warrant lifetime therapy. However, the risk is high up to eight times, compared to normal individuals. Need to watch for DVT symptoms particularly and if there is another episode in future, with or without OCP or any other factors, lifetime therapy is warranted. If there is another thrombotic episode, I would strongly suggest starting blood thinners for life as thrombus, if not detected early like the present time, can be life-threatening. 5. Being heterozygous at present, with a single episode, at present, with associated possible bleeding risks, blood thinners for life may not be warranted. I hope it helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

CSF rhinorrhea is a known complication of extensive FESS (functional endoscopic sinus surgery). If a pledget had shown confirmed CSK leak, it sure needs to be investigated. Small leaks heal and recover by themselves however, if the leak persists longer, then it needs to be sealed by endoscopic surgery. In your case, any watery discharge from the nose should not be ignored.

Six months ago, I had PPP removal from my penis head (uncircumcised) with CO2 laser. Two months ago, my penis head started to become red and now, almost half of my penis head is red in color. I noticed that there is a lot of dryness. Though I do not have PPP, sometimes, it hurts a little after sex or masturbation if I do not use oil lubricants. I went to dermatologist visit here and she prescribed me to use Travocort cream twice daily for 10 days and then Canesten cream in the night for a month. I have done it and did not observe any change. It remains the same. I will attach the photos of my case here. Thank you doctor.","Doctor":"Hi. Penile pearly papule is just a normal variant. It is not a disease, so no treatment is required for it. But, you got it removed by CO2 laser. Penis skin is very sensitive area and CO2 laser always gives redness of skin. Not only penile area, but even in the normal skin redness comes and persists for four to six months. In your condition, the best way of treatment is just wait and let the skin heal from inside. Canesten cream (Clotrimazole) is an antifungal and it will not use here. Travocort (Isoconazole and Diflucortolone) has steroid, which you have used 10 days. But, it is a very mild steroid, so it may not subside redness. I suggest you Flutivate cream (Fluticasone) for 10 days over the red skin. Consult your doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. Avoid friction and use lubricant. Just wait for a month and the problem will subside itself. Actually, intense treatment is not required in your condition.

I understand your concerns, vertical heterophoria is a disorder of the mechanisms which maintain the balance of the eye muscles, keeping them on target. Although rare, these can lead to significant distress and dizziness as well. The best test to see if you have heterophoria in any direction is the cover or cover-uncover and alternate cover tests. These should be done with glasses first and then without them. You need the help of another person while doing this at home or can be quickly done at the doctor's clinic. 1. Cover test or uncover test - close one of your eyes with your hand while trying to look at an image around six meters away first and then held at 50 cm apart, with both your eyes, then take away the covering hand. If you see the eye that was covered moving, then you have a phoria in the direction opposite the direction in which the eye moved. 2. Alternate cover test - is the same as the cover or uncover tests, only that the covering hand is rapidly moved from eye to eye. This gives a more accurate picture of the type or magnitude of the heterophoria. These are two of the best, safest and economical tests that you can use to diagnose heterophoria. In case you need more information about heterophoria or tests or management options, please send me a scanned copy of your doctors reports and test results. I will do my best to help you with this.

I assure you not worry as you have consulted the appropriate expert physician who will take care all of your medical concerns. Your aunts report suggests she has multiple noncancerous cysts i.e fibrocystic change of breast. They have categorised it through a score to show its level of malignancy. It is called BI-RADS (breast imaging reporting and data system) score, devised by American College of Radiology to standardize the breast sonography reporting universally in a more professional way. BI-RADS score 0 means benign lesions (no cancer) to BI-RADS score 5 means you have 95 % chances that this specific opacity being seen under Sonography is a cancer and you need to proceed for biopsy testing of this mass. Your aunt has score 5 mass at 11' O'clock position that means she has 95 % chances that this mass is a cancer. She also has lymph nodal thickenings (and it may be due to spread of the breast cancer to these lymph nodes in the axilla). But we have still to confirm it without doubt through biopsy of the lesion. I would advice you to go for biopsy of the left breast tissue from 11O'clock position and also a biopsy of the lymph nodes from axilla. Ask your treating physician to refer you for the same."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, A small live ant has accidentally gone into my nose. I tried to blow it out but not sure about it? Can it enter the brain or lungs? And lay eggs there? What are the symptoms?","Doctor":"Hello. The ant, by all means, will be dead and blown out of your nasal airways because our nose has the following protective mechanisms. 1. Nasal vibrissae (small hairs) which block particles size of an ant. 2. Viscous secretions (mucus) upon which still smaller particles like dust get glued (about the size of 0.5 microns). 3. Sneezing is a protective reflex action whereby foreign bodies irritating nasal mucosa is thrown out vigorously followed by copious secretions which wash out rest of noxious items in the nose. 4. Immunity, specific immunoglobulins, complement proteins, ions, and other molecules.  Hence the ant cannot survive inside the nose. Leave alone laying eggs. Now in case, it does survive, next most possible event is it getting washed and glued to the mucus and then swallowed along with saliva and reaching the stomach where the acid will kill it. Nasal secretions follow a natural path towards the throat, then esophagus and finally stomach. If it does make any attempt to pass anywhere else, it will bite you, and you would wince in pain. There is absolutely no possibility of it entering the brain without your having experienced the pain of its biting. There is no direct communication with mind unless it navigates through the skull base (bone). There is no possibility it entering the lungs through the air you breathe because our protective mechanisms prevent particles as small as 0.5 microns. If you are still worried put a few drops of saline nasal drops on either side of nose and rest in flat sleeping position for five minutes. This will add bulk to the mucus (nasal secretions) and wash off the impurities. You can spit what comes into your throat."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS).

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

Like no muscle inside the body. He takes electro homeopathy NaCl drip two to three times a week. Please suggest some thing how to be better?","Doctor":"Hello. Patients with diabetes mellitus can develop contracture of digits and limbs as a result of soft tissue thickening in these areas. This can lead to wasting of the muscle from disuse. This is referred to as atrophy. You did not mention your father age, and if he is old enough, then he supposes to go for DEXA scan and blood levels of Calcium and Vitamin D and Vitamin B12. Ask him to go to the physician, and if I were his physician, I would keep monitoring of his blood sugar, prescribe his calcium and vitamin D supplement and injection of Vitamin B12 or mecobalamin tablet and further follow-up accordingly. We have to be always on the safe side, and patient safety is our top priority. Also, your father needs an annual screening for his eyes, foot, and kidneys."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I doubt squint eye. Whether squint eye is hereditary, and is there any treatment for these?","Doctor":"Hello. Squint eyes are the eyes which are not appropriately aligned, each eye focus on a different object and send signals to the brain leading to confusion. Thus the child starts ignoring signs coming from squint eye (deviated eye) resulting in amblyopia or lazy eye. It has to be aggressively treated in childhood or else cannot be processed once development occurs. Treatment is surgical, in some minor cases, prism spectacles. The exact cause is not known either developmental or hereditary. The treatment has to be done as soon as possible."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, After how many days of periods, sex should not happen to avoid pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hello. Your question actually pertains to a natural birth control method called rhythm method calendar method (you can search it on net). Let me tell you the safe days are the days you can actually have sex in order not to get pregnant but, this method is not full proof and there are failure rates too. Consider first day of your cycle (menstrual cycle) as the day from which you began to bleed. You keep a track of your cycles and determine your shortest and longest cycle but before that know it that your cycles must be regular. Substract 20 from your shortest cycle and 10 from your longest cycle and you get your safe days. Eg. Shortest is 26 Longest is 30. 26-20= 6 30-10= 20. Days 6 to 20 is unsafe for you. Rest all will be safe to have sex to avoid pregnancy. There are many other calculations for calendar which you yourself can search but my recommendations will be five days after the last day of your first cycle that is when the bleeding stops will be the safest (though not 100 percent)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Last year started to work out in the gym for six months and made good gains in strength-wise and stamina wise. After some months, my left arm became very hard and painful while doing weights. Later cervical pain also started. And because of it, I have stopped my gym activity completely. Orthopedic referred me for physiotherapy after taking cervical and spinal MRI. Currently, the cervical pain is intermittent and left arm still pains if any weight is lifted. I have noticed one thing while doing bench press the pressure comes on behind the neck muscles. Someone told me about nerve hardening. Also, left-hand faces are tingling if I sleep on the left side. I am doing physio exercise regularly. I want to recover and restart my gym activity. It has been over a year, and still, the problem is not getting resolved. I do not even know what steps to take towards recovery.","Doctor":"Hello. I reviewed your symptoms, and it seems at second levels of the upper neck, a cervical region the disc bulges are pressing on C4, C5, C6 roots, and incidentally, it supplies shoulder girdle as well upper arm muscles including biceps. The paraesthesia, what we call for tingling sensation is again because of the above. First of all, I would advise to be off from weight lifting for a few months and not only that any heavy lifting objects, riding a two-wheeler, sleeping with high pillow must be restricted. For physical exercise, you can have walking briskly, and I insist on undergoing planned programmed physical therapy in your place itself. If pain persists, you can have Naproxen 500 to 1000 mg daily for 10 days. Proper sitting methods while in a job and avoid computer screen viewing for hours and altering your lifestyle would alleviate and make you feel better over time, instead if you strain yourself with heavy gym exercise, things will go worse. You may need repeat MRI after 6 to 10 months to assess the size of disc protrusion Naproxen 500 to 1000 mg once a day for 10 days.

It does call for concern no doubt, but you need to be careful now with that tooth at least. Sensitivity means your tooth's outer layer has been eroded, so you need to take care of a few things, 1. Do not over brush that tooth or tooth in that area. 2. Avoid taking very hot and very cold food as they may cause shock to the tooth. 3. Do warm water and salt rinse three to four times a day. 4.

I get really sharp pains in the same area when I lift heavy things, it is so uncomfortable at all times. I have a history of peptic ulcers from the time I was 16, but this pain is different and constant.","Doctor":"Hello. Well the pain which comes in or worsen after doing physical movements is highly likely secondary to muscle and bone related. The pain of peptic ulcer however can be knawing and usually worsens after meals. But given the fact that you have been using Omeprazole which is a strong acid suppressant, is helpful in healing peptic ulcer; the presence of peptic ulcers in your stomach seems to be a rare possibility.  1. I suggest you to take tablet Orphanderine plus Paracetamol combination one tablet three times daily for a few days and avoid doing heavy lifting or any thing that you think will worsen the pain; and see how does it go.  2. If your pain does not solve then I suggest you to increase the Omeprazole dose to 40 mg twice daily half an hour before meals. This would certainly improve the pain if it secondary to peptic ulcer disease.  Lastly there are other conditions which tend to cause pain which worsen with excercise and bearing weight and one such condition is called nerve entrapment pain.

Usually, pregnancy is confirmed by a urine pregnancy test, or blood test as you told (serum beta hCG), or by scan around six weeks. 4) So at present if you got urine pregnancy test positive means you are pregnant, no need to go for beta hCG now, do a transvaginal scan for viability by six weeks (means three days later from today), otherwise, the scan will be too early to see the pregnancy sac."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My tooth is rotting away below the gum line. I have not been to a dentist because I could never afford it, but now I think I might need one really bad, so what should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. Your thought is exactly right. It is high time you visited a dentist. Tooth rotting below the gum line is not a good sign. The dentist would tell you to take an X-ray. If it is non-painful and if the x-ray reveals that the infection has not touched the pulp, you can go for a filling. It is advised that you see the dentist as soon as possible because once the infection spreads deep into the roots, even a root canal treatment would not be possible.  In that kind of a scenario, removal of the tooth becomes the only option. Basic procedures cost is less. The expenses of treatment increases if not treated in time. Periodic visits to a dentist for a general check-up will address those concerns. I hope this answers your query."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,Someone with a cold sore kissed my preemie baby, and she has been spitting her bottle out and crying what should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. Your baby seems to be on oxygen. You have not mentioned how old is the baby? For how long she has been in the hospital and are there any other problems with the baby. Or was she because she came into contact with a cold sore? Cold sore infection can sometimes lead to contamination of the mouth or lungs, occasionally other organs like brain, etc. It depends on the extent of the spread of infection and the severity. Being a preemie (preterm birth) always puts babies at risk of disease. Your baby needs injectable antibiotic medication for the cold sores, for a specific duration depending on the extent. If vomiting is because of it, it will gradually subside. If she is spitting up due to other causes, which can happen on the premises, your doctor would explain that. The sores are painful, and some topical applications would be useful to relieve the pain. You can discuss the extant of infection with your treating doctor."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a milky like white color on my tongue that is more noticeable in the back my tongue should I be worried?

Candidiasis associated is with pain and burning sensation at times. Can be scraped off the tongue. Usually occurs in diabetics. 2. Leukoplakia is non-scrappable, painless but can progress to cancerous condition if not treated early. 3. Oral lichen planus is associated with a burning sensation, pain may or may not be present.

There have not been documented evidence of ecstasy having a reaction with an OCP (oral contraceptive pill) pill, but some times the efficiency of the pill may come down with medications of this category.

If your menses had been regular before five years, and then they became irregular presenting with intermenstrual bleed starting with spotting and then increasing to increased flow, which was controlled by Sysron-N tablet which is progesterone, (Norethisterone). The pattern of bleeding indicates that there is progesterone deficiency during the midcycle and that causes irregular shedding of the endometrium as the secretory phase of the endometrium is not achieved in progesterone deficiency so, and there is a presence of disordered proliferative endometrial lining which is unstable and hence keeps breaking causing bleeding. It is advised that you undergo an endometrial biopsy between day 18 to 22 and send for histopathological examination, which if turns out to be disordered proliferative endometrium, then you would have to be placed on progesterone from day 15-day 25 for 10 days each cycle for six months at least to restabilize the hormonal concentration and hence making the periods regular with stoppage of bleeding completely. You may discuss the option with your gynecologist and take an informed decision."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have been suffering from an ingrown nail from the past two years.

I have been through physical therapy and that did not work. My doctor was talking to me about surgery. So I researched and found a surgery where they go in and cut the disk off that is bulging out. It is an open discectomy I believe. I was wondering what the risks are. Could I possibly get paralyzed? Are there any cases of getting paralyzed? How long would I be off my feet?","Doctor":"Hello. Surgery for bulging disc is only indicated if pain in back is servere and not relieved by physiotherapy, then you need fusion surgery or if you have moderate to severe leg pain because of nerve compression causing decreased mobility, then you need discectomy. Chances of getting paralysis after surgery are very low may be around 1 in 100 but other smaller problems after surgery are common. So, if pain is bad and is affecting your day to day activities then only you should think of surgery."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have poison ivy rashes on various parts of my body with no open blisters.

However, the lab forgot to order a peripheral smear review (which her doctor requested). So a week later, the CBC was repeated with a smear. Oddly, the results of this new CBC were, Low WBC. Low RBC. Low neutrophils. (The smear was normal). At the time of this second lab draw, the lab tech commented this is going to bruise, and it did. A huge dark bruise and bump formed on my mother's arm very soon after the blood was drawn. I assume this is a hematoma. My question is, can a lab draw technique error (as evidenced by the large bruise and hematoma painful) be the cause or reason for the low WBC, low RBC, and low neutrophils? Please keep in mind the Smear result was normal (unremarkable). I should also point out that this CBC was manual (versus automated). I know it is essential to repeat the CBC with smear again to verify, but I like to know if improper drawing or lab techniques could cause the odd results and if so, what the mechanism of action would be. I can show you her actual results, plus a photo of the bruise or hematoma.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to the icliniq.com. I have reviewed your query and attached images as well. You are having superficial thrombophlebitis most likely as per given history and attached image. It can be most likely due to a technical error during collection. However, your low red blood cell count, low ANC, and the low total count could not be due to a technical fault. It can be temporary finding due to some unnoticed infection. I suggest you repeat CBC (complete blood count) after few days approximately after 7 to 10 days and it will come standard mostly. Your peripheral smear examination report is normal, so no need to worry. You can revert with reports once done after a few days. For thrombophlebitis or bruise, I suggest you apply ice wrapped in thin cloth frequently like five to six times a day. Thrombophleb gel also can be beneficial. I hope I have answered your question. Let me know if you have another problem in mind."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I had gonorrhea or chlamydia five times. I had penile discharge before four months. I started taking Doxycycline, Azithromycin on and off for four months. When I take medicine, the discharge color changes from yellow to clear, and it is not all the time, mostly when I squeeze my penis (very little clear discharge) or in the morning after few hours at work, when I check my underwear, I see few white spots.

I tried to stop Doxycycline for a week, the discharge turned from watery to yellow, and it happens almost all the time. Now I finished 3G Azithromycin (500 mg daily) and 2.4G Cefixime (400 mg daily) and 4G Doxycycline (200 to 400 mg daily). I do not have discharge anymore, but when I squeeze my penis hard, I can see a clear watery line on the tip of my penis. No burning sensation during urination or otherwise. Please advise me on what to do as every current dermatologist I asked does not know what to do.","Doctor":"Hello. As there are no signs or symptoms like fever, wound, pain, burning micturition, or active discharge, the possibility of an active infection seems to be unlikely. The thin line you are mentioning that appears on the penile tip on squeezing seems more like the lubricating fluid that comes out from penis when stimulated or aroused and is quite normal. It can also be seen on your underwear as sticky spots, which are also normal.To be extra sure, repeat a urine routine and microscopy test and a blood test for STD panel.

I am suffering from hair loss for the past three to four years. I can see my hairline slowly receding from the forehead. I have been suggested Hair4U 10 % lotion and Biotin tablets.

The only thing is that the treatment for hair loss has to be followed for a long time and you need to be regular with your follow up visits.

Hair4U is a topical solution used to treat male pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia). It contains 10 % Minoxidil or Aminexil (Kopexil). Biotin (Multivitamin) tablets promote hair growth as well.

After three years, I fell in love with a girl, but then she left me. This created a check for me, so I wanted to study more to prove myself.

There was an episode of racing thoughts once. I had to take massive, sleeping pills to sleep. In the end, a psychiatrist diagnosed me as bipolar type 2. He put me on Seroquel, but it was not sufficient. Sometimes it took the depression off, but other times the depression was still here.My parents took me to see a psychiatrist overseas, and he also diagnosed me with bipolar. He did put me on Lithium and Abilify 10 mg. I never felt this good before. My question is, do I only have depression? And not bipolar. Lithium can help improve depression symptoms, so maybe that is the case of what is happening. If I only have depression, I should be put on antidepressants.","Doctor":"Hello. It is good to know that you are feeling better on your current medication of Lithium and Abilify (Aripiprazole). From the information you have given, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive opinion, but it does look like you have experienced some hypomanic symptoms in addition to depressive features. That is why your doctor would have diagnosed you with bipolar 2. Often people get diagnosed with depression, and it is easy to miss bipolar 2 unless a comprehensive assessment is done. So I presume you had a thorough assessment. I will suggest discussing your queries with your doctor during your next review so that he can explain as well. Continue your medication as prescribed. Also, try to get some psychological therapy as well. In due course, when you continue to be stable, your doctor may consider decreasing the medication gradually under close supervision. It may not happen for at least a year. Avoid habits that can destabilize your mood. Avoid alcohol. It helps to exercise regularly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a rash on my penis.

I do not have BP or sugar or any other problem. But the colleagues who had attacks also had normal echo and TMT during their annual check-up before five months. So, should I go for checking whether my arteries have any clogging? Is it needed? If yes, how to get it done?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome on icliniq.com. I passed carefully through your medical history and would like to explain that your clinical symptomatology does not seem to be cardiac-related. Pain modulated by coughing or body posture modulation goes in favor of an extra-cardiac cause, most likely a respiratory inflammation or infection. I would recommend discussing with your attending physician (GP or internist) on the possibility of performing a medical examination and additional tests (complete blood count, PCR for detecting possible inflammation, chest X-ray study and other tests if necessary). In case you have difficulty getting out sputum, an expectorant could help. Anti-Inflammatory medication and if the bacterial infection is confirmed, antibiotics medication would be required to solve your actual health issue. I hope to have been helpful to you. In case of any further questions, feel free to ask me again."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Do not panic these issues mostly end safely, especially with the nasal sprays and Prednisone you are taking. Avoid straining, vigorous sneezing, or coughing. If you have to sneeze or cough you should open your mouth while doing it be calm even if your drum has ruptured it can heal again your problem is not permanent.

It was very red and white and now it is mostly white. Even though half the sore touches my tooth, the tooth does not hurt at all. It is very painful to floss and eat anything spicy. Should I see a dentist? How urgent is this?","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the picture of lesion and from it, it looks like gingivitis as the surrounding area is inflamed (attachment removed to protect patient identity). If you ask me ideally, then there is a definite need to see a dentist as it takes time to heal spontaneously and there is a possibility it can spread to adjacent areas.But in regard to your question about urgency, I do not think that is the case. Since it has changed from red to white which indicates that the healing process is ongoing. What you can do at this stage is buy a Chlorhexidine (mouthwash) from nearby grocery or medical store and do three times gargles. Take 10 ml of medicine with 10 ml of water and thoroughly rinse it in the mouth for two to three minutes. This will help you in early healing. Other than that, keep on watching it. If there is an increase in size, pain or redness report me back."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Why do I always need to keep tensing my throat as if something is stuck?","Doctor":"Hi. What you are describing is known as a globus sensation. This is defined as the persistent or intermittent sensation of a lump or foreign body in the throat for at least 12 weeks. The most common causes would be gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), abnormalities of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES), psychologic and psychiatric disorders, and stress. I would suggest an evaluation with an upper endoscopy as a more comprehensive evaluation for anatomic abnormalities. A 24-hr pH study can also be considered to definitively rule in or out GERD. If the GI workup is not revealing, you may want to be evaluated by an ENT specialist to see if there are any upper esophageal sphincter disorders. Reflux is treatable by starting antacids, taking smaller meals, avoiding spicy, oily and junk foods, avoiding late night meals, avoid stress and anxiety, raising the head of your pillow by 6 to 8 inches."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Is it possible for me to have a successful pregnancy with a 7.3 cm intramural posterior fibroid?

But on the other hand, it is also a risk factor for the miscarriages, and it may or may not interfere with implantation though miscarriages are higher with submucosal ones. But it is not like that you cannot conceive or have successful pregnancies. You have the chances to get pregnant. Most of the intramural fibroids are notorious for making labor process complicated, but as far as implantation is concerned, they do not interfere much with it. I hope it has helped you.

I feel bored and depressed and angry full day.As I come alone in my room, I start thinking and then doing it. I told myself that it is last time, but after two days I forget and start it again, and after that, I feel tired and sleepy. By health, I am perfect, but sometimes I feel shivering of legs and weakness. In my religion, it is a sin. I think I would never stop it. Any medicine to stop it? Or what should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. If you want to know your problem, I like to tell you that you are not having any problem. The occasional feeling of shivering or weakness are the normal phenomenon that occurs to everybody, but the only difference with you is that you are relating these feelings with masturbation. Having masturbation up to two times a day is very normal for your age kids, and there is nothing normal. I am sorry to say that most of the religion in the world talked about sexual thing as a sin due to various reasons at the time of their inception, but science repeatedly asserted that there is nothing abnormal about sexual thing including masturbation. The answer to so-called your problem of masturbation is stop thinking it as a sin. Think in line of science, not in the line of religion. Masturbation is nowhere different from sex and multiple benefits over sex like no risk of sexually transmitted diseases. If the above answer is not helping you and you are not able to stop thinking I advise you to contact through video consultation so I can provide you required counseling face to face or medicine if it is necessary."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from frequent urination.

If you went through clinical examination and you do not have any issues. Then the most probable cause can be stress or anxiety or hyperactive bladder. So for stress or anxiety, you need to follow measures to calm down your mind. In the case of hyperactive bladder, do exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor. These will help you.

So how does this method help to increase the oxygen level in the blood?","Doctor":"Hello. I am a cardiologist, and I am glad to clarify your doubt. In Tetrology of Fallot, the defect between the two ventricles is significant and non-restrictive. Hence both ventricles will function at the same pressure. Also, the aorta lies directly above the ventricular septal defect (VSD).  Therefore how much pulmonary and systemic circulation occurs is determined by the degree of pulmonary stenosis. If the pulmonary stenosis is severe, a large amount of impure blood gets pumped from the RV to the aorta leading to cyanosis (bluish discoloration of extremities). If the pulmonary stenosis is mild, less blood gets shunted to the left side, and the patient may not be cyanotic at rest."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My daughter is 25 years old, had a miscarriage a few months back.

It has been a living nightmare ever since. I was completely fine, pain-wise, until three days after the grafting. Out of nowhere, I was in excruciating pain. Like deep in the nerve type pain. At that point, it was only my lower right side that was in pain. One of my stitches busted, and the bone grafting material was oozing out. The dentist saw me that evening on an emergency basis and cleaned it up and stitched me back up. Reassured me that my pain would end. He also switched me to a stronger antibiotic. Well, not only did the pain not go away, my left side started in on the same excruciating pain on the next day. The pain is that sharp, stabbing, throbbing pain that increase with each heartbeat. Worst pain of my life. It seems to be coming from teeth next to where the grafting was done. I should also add that I have a bridge on my lower front four teeth, with teeth as my anchoring teeth. No one knows where my pain is coming from, so no one knows how to treat me. I am miserable. Have not eaten anything in three days. Talking, drinking, and eating cause immediate, intense throbbing. It feels like nerve pain to me. Similar to the way I have felt in the past when an infection has reached my nerves.

The ultrasound had shown mild inflammation of the appendix. Doctor then suggested a CECT whole abdomen. However, in the past, I have had difficulty keeping down the contrast they ask to drink. So the doctor advised CT Scan with IV contrast only and left out the drinking contrast part. The result of the CT scan came normal showing no Appendicitis. My query is, can the CT scan be done without drinking the contrast? Will it be accurate? Is IV only CT scan without the drink reliable? Is it surprising that USG showed mild appendicitis, but the CT scan did not? Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello. The appendix is a tubular structure measuring less than 5 mm in normal people. When there is appendicitis, the appendix enlarges to 8 to 10 mm or more in diameter. Ultrasound scan has an accuracy of 50 percent for appendicitis in most patients. You have been found with a likely 9 mm appendix before some days. The CT scan was done before a week. It is possible that the inflammation of appendix decreased in a week and so the CT scan finding with only IV contrast showed near-normal appendix and no features of inflammation surrounding it. An oral and IV contrast CT is always better to look for appendix related problems. There is no need to drink lots of oral contrast at a time, and you can drink in a few sips every few minutes for two hours to help the contrast reach the appendix area. I do this for my patients, and there are fewer chances of confusion in diagnosis of appendicitis. In your case, there is a possibility that the inflammation of appendicitis decreased in the interval between ultrasound and CT scans."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have backache for the last three years.

I feel pain in the upper back even if I lower my neck , My MRI reports are, 1. Disc desiccatory changes are noted at CV2-CV3 and CV3-CV4 levels. 2. Circumferential disc bulges are noted at CV3-CV4, CV4-CV5 and CV5-CV6 levels causing compression of the thecal sac, narrowing of bilateral lateral recesses and compression of bilateral exiting nerve roots. 3. Circumferential disc bulges are noted at LV4-LV5 and LV5-SV1 levels causing indentation of thecal sac without significant nerve root compression. Can you please suggest me some solution and what sort of disease I have.","Doctor":"Hello. The problems you are facing are due to excessive strain on back and neck muscles. As you said, the reason is the prolonged standing, bad posture of the back and neck. All I can advise, irrespective of what the MRI says is, 1. Avoid bad postures like during reading or watching TV or relaxing or bending to lift weights so on. 2. Avoid pillows. 3. Never sleep in a sitting position with head stooping forward. Avoid neck cracking. Most important is to build the paraspinal muscles. Do lots of exercises bending back. You can get it on the net. Do not plan for any surgical procedures.

It takes a huge amount of courage to question ourselves, and especially in cases of NPD (narcissistic personality disorder) and ASPD (antisocial personality disorder). Where the individual lacks the insight of his issues and often only sees problems in others. Personality disorder, in general, is a difficult entity to be treated, but continuous long term therapy (cognitive behavior therapy) and psychotherapy help wonderfully in stabilizing if not curing completely. Instead of working on changing yourself, you should focus on managing your thought patterns and behavior. The good thing in your case is that you already have some level of awareness, which would help you out. So I would suggest starting therapy as soon as possible.

For the past year, I have been experiencing muscle twitches all over my body, not all at once. My right thigh may twitch for several days then stop. Then my left shoulder, or ankle, or bottom of my foot. I searched plenty about it and concluded that it probably was not ALS because I did not have any muscle weakness. I used to work out quite regularly but had not in the past couple of years. About a month ago, I decided to get back into my workout routine, and I noticed considerable weakness on my left side while doing a bench press. I get the dumbbells out I curl the same max left, and right arm, shoulder press the same, but tricep- that is where the weakness is. Doing tricep extensions, my right side can do 30 lbs while my left only 15. I had also noticed more twitching in my left tri lately, so I panicked. Went to my general practitioner who referred me to a neurologist for an exam and EMG. The physical exam only revealed slightly brisk reflexes in both legs on the knee test, but he said they were not hyper. All other reflexes normal. No Babinski sign. He could feel that my left arm was a little weaker in the strength test. Next was the EMG which he said was normal, muscle and nerve. Since then, though, my tri continues to twitch as well as below my left shoulder blade on my back, and it keeps me in a state of constant worry that maybe the EMG was done too early and I have ALS. I am continually comparing muscles in the mirror and can see slight areas on my left tri and shoulder that do not match the right. I have started some light dumbbell work on the left tri. When I first noticed the weakness, I could do 30 lbs max on my right, but only 15 lbs max on my left. Within the past two weeks, I have gotten the left side up to 20 lbs max. I am hoping that is a good sign but the twitching, along with knowing it is weak, are about to drive me crazy. What do you think about all of that? Should ALS be on my radar?","Doctor":"Hello. I am gone through your history. You are having unexplained twisting movements of muscles and weakness on the left upper limb. Your history does not mention any sensory symptoms or urinary bladder symptoms. Hence, I am assuming it normal. You are suffering for a year, but your disease remains almost static. I mean at present it is non-progressive or slowly progressive. You already have consulted a neurologist, and there is no hyperreflexia, wasting of hands or shoulder, Babinski absent, with normal EMG or NCV. Your disease is, at present looks benign. My advice is to look for a metabolic parameter like serum, calcium, thyroid function test, serum sodium, serum potassium, serum vitamin D3 level, serum vitamin B12 level. If above all are normal, then you repeat EMG NCS after three to four-month of the initial test. And keep follow-up with a thorough neurological examination by a neurologist.

I have a loving family and hang out with friends regularly, but I often feel alone and end up being sad and lonely in my room. I go from happy to sad in the blink of an eye. Going to the gym and working out is a huge part of my life, I do it every day and love it. But recently I have not had much if any drive to go and would rather lay in bed. Should I be worried? Is feeling lonely normal? Am I just going through teenage emotions? I am also stressed about school starting up and have summer homework that is stressing me out.","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, it is normal if you do not even any strong physical stressor, worry or thoughts or preoccupations. Mood swings at your age are quite normal due to hormonal changes in teens. The important thing is to keep moving on and completing things rather than avoiding it, such as hitting a work out, meeting with friends, etc. Besides, if you ever feel overwhelming emotions or worrying about anything which you think have difficulty controlling than you must visit a counselor and seek help. Sometimes swinging in moods become difficult for young ones and they become apprehensive. Also, to make yourself relax, you can do the following, 1. Deep breathing exercises. 2. Walk for at least 30 minutes per day. 3. Workout if possible to release toxins out of your body. 4. Reduce smoking (if you do). 5. Avoid junk and spicy food, soft drinks. 6. Increase water intake. 7.

Any infection in the genital tract. 3. Doing sex while the vagina is still dry. 4. Uncomfortable or unrealistic sex position. First, you need to assure you are not having any injury or painful spot in the vagina.

First of all, miscarriages may be caused due to chromosomal abnormalities, hormone problems, distorted anatomy of the uterus, infective causes, unknown causes. Since you do not have a history of recurrent miscarriages, so you do not need to panic about your next pregnancy. Also, you need to get rid off the cyst, as cysts reduce the efficacy of any fertility medicines. As the size is less than five cm, give it three months to reduce by taking oral contraceptives (Yaz, Diane 35) and folic acid. Once the cyst is gone, Clomiphene can work better, helping you to ovulate. But you also need to rule out other causes of infertility. 1. Are you overweight, BMI>25. 2. Do you have increased facial hair? 3. Check the partner's semen analysis. 4. Check blood for TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), free T4, prolactin, LH (luteinizing hormone), FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone). 5. Check both the partner's blood for sugar fasting. The sickness feeling could be just due to Clomiphene overdosage, as Clomiphene is generally given only for five days and a dose of 50 mg to start with.

The problem mainly in your case seems to be food lodgement behind (distal) the wisdom tooth causing prolonged gum infection and discomfort for a few years. In such instances in which patient has been experiencing pain, it is suggested to remove such wisdom tooth to allow proper cleaning at the back and to prevent decay of adjacent teeth and maintain oral hygiene.

For how long the drops of urine keep coming out of penis after urination? First, I would like to tell you that a few drops (four to five) of urine may come out through the penis after urination which is normal for all males. The reason for this is the long urethra (penis shaft) in males as compared to females. So, after urination, you should slightly jerk your penis to remove the extra drops of urine remaining in the penis, or, you can also use a tissue paper for the same purpose. With increasing age, there may occur urinary incontinence and other problems, that is why I would first like to know your age. Then, several drops are important because usually also few drops may come out. But if the number of drops is more than usual, then only we can say that you are having a disease and should be treated or not. So do not worry because things can be normal also. So now the first thing you should do is to give all the information which I have asked for, then only I can find out what is the problem.

I am afraid of driving alone and have a fear of giving interviews.","Doctor":"Hello. The symptoms you have mentioned are low confidence, shyness in public, escaping attitude, fear of interviews. These symptoms point towards a diagnosis of social phobia. The most studied and most effective treatment for phobias is behavior therapy. A variety of behavioral treatment techniques have been used, the most common being systematic desensitization. In this method, the client is exposed serially to a predetermined list of anxiety-provoking stimuli graded in a hierarchy from the least to the most frightening. Through the use of anti-anxiety drugs and instruction in muscle relaxation, clients are taught how to induce in themselves both mental and physical relaxation.  Once they have mastered the techniques, clients are taught to use them to induce relaxation in the face of each anxiety-provoking stimulus. As they become desensitized to each stimulus in the scale, the patients move up to the next stimulus until, ultimately, what previously produced the most anxiety no longer elicits the painful effect. Effective drugs for the treatment of social phobia include (1) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like Paroxetine or Escitalopram. (2) The Benzodiazepines like Ativan or Rivotril. Another option is to take tablet Beta cap 20 mg 30 minutes before you are going to face an anxiety-provoking situation. Please visit your nearest psychiatrist for proper evaluation and treatment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have some serious problem in my family. I am 20 years old and studying. But something is not going well in my family. I got angry on little things and lost my control over me and behaved like a killer. Also, I have tremors at that time. Always I feel stressed, depressed, and fatigue. For that reason, though I have the eagerness to take food, I take a little. In my family, my father has some behavioral issues. He is also a psycho patient. All-time he disturbs us behaving rudely and he also got entangled in an outside relationship with a lady and the lady cheated him. So, now father becomes mad. My mother is also a cardiac patient. So, all the time a claustrophobic environment is there in our house. Moreover, the pressure from my father. I am always in fear that what I can do in this situation. I have another tension regarding my mother. She is always tensed. She does not sleep at night. So, I am tensed there about the current situation. I do not focus my mind into something. I feel that nothing is good around me. Even I dream about lots of bad things. Even midnight I hear that my parents are quarreling falsely. I cannot sleep constantly. Even after a sleep of 4 to 5 hours, I feel like I have done too many hard works.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand what you are going through right now. Disputes in family and pathological relationships, they all cause tremendous stress and pressure. If you think your father is having disturbed behavior and aggressiveness, then you can consult a psychiatrist for him. If your mother is also slipping into depression then you can have a psychiatric consultation for her also. I guess family therapy would do best for all of you. Apart from it, try to do some lifestyle changes which can decrease the mental stress on you. 30 minutes of regular physical activity will improve your body and mental fitness. Yoga, meditation and breathing exercise will also help you. A neutral family therapist can help best to get you out of this situation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 21 years old and never had any issues of bad health.

Except for high red blood cell count 5.54. They did not say anything about that, though. Should I be worried about this becoming something more serious? Sometimes my left arm is colder than my right. I am a hypochondriac lol, so please let me know about all of this.","Doctor":"Hello. An irregular heartbeat can be very much normal in healthy people and also sometimes abnormal. Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are normal sometimes. On the other hand, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is abnormal rhythm, that has long term complications. These are the two most common reasons for an irregular heartbeat. If you again develop such heartbeats, then long term ECG monitoring (Holter monitoring for 48 hours or event monitor) may be done to diagnose abnormal rhythm. Sinus arrhythmia is almost never felt. Avoid alcohol, smoking, caffeine, and stress. Follow-up if you again have any such complaint."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

What is the procedure needed and required cost?","Doctor":"Hello. For your mother, we need to know some health information like her history of blood pressure, recent surgery, diabetes, or any history of blood disorders. For implants, they are actually of two types. 1. Basic implants. 2. Advanced implants. Both are imported implants, basic and advanced. Well, the cost of a basic implant starts from 10 k per implant, and advance implant starts with 25 k per implant. Apart from this, there will be a separate package of teeth that she will choose. The price can differ according to region and reputation and experience of clinician and material costs. For her basic implant will be best. All implants have warranty mostly for the same duration. The treatment will take a long time. In the first stage, we operate mouth to place the implant (as your mother has nine missing teeth). Then there will be a gap for healing bone for three months. After three months, the impression will be taken, and then fixed teeth will be placed in about a month. For a better and economical option, you can opt for fixed dentures that will exactly look like original teeth and will be placed in a month. I wish your mother good health and happiness.

Small pterygium does not affect but large pterygium may cause astigmatism and blurring and may need surgical removal. I am not sure about your insurance policy but usually, cosmetic surgeries are not covered. So, if it is causing blurring or astigmatism, then you might claim that it is affecting your vision. You should discuss with your doctor and he might make a way out for you within legal limits of your insurance policy. Second is you get it done privately but that may cost you. So, discuss with your doctor and I hope he will suggest you the best."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I discovered a tiny lump on the inside of my upper eyelid quite a long time ago.

Less likely, but it is possible if the sore on your lips is herpes only. But, chances of this happening are less as infection at lip will give you immunity against current infection.

He went to various psychiatrist to make sure that he is actually ADHD. Six doctors confirmed that he has ADHD and two doctors said he has bipolar disorder. He says that he was given Xanax as a treatment for the anxiety caused by ADHD and bipolar. He takes 10 tablets of 1 mg Xanax a day and sometimes, 11 to 12 tablets a day. Occasionally, when he takes less tablets, he smokes weed. He says that the combination of 5 to 8 tablets of Xanax with weed is equal to 10 tablets of 1 mg Xanax a day. He also takes tablet 300 mg Seroquel at night to help him sleep. My questions are is Xanax considered a medication for ADHD or bipolar? Is it advised to take 10 to 12 tablets of 1 mg Xanax a day? Is it fine to mix Xanax with weed? What is the appropriate medication for ADHD and bipolar?

Now, I have been suffering from the pollen allergy syndrome and fairly bad seasonal allergies. Three months ago, I got my first tattoo. It looks beautiful and healed wonderfully. After getting a tattoo, I noticed seven hives on my legs on the same day, but no hives on the tattoo. Immediately, I thought that I was having an allergic reaction to the ink. So, I took 5 mL of Benadryl and Allegra. I contacted my artist and he gave me the list of ingredients in my ink, which was just carbon pigment, water and witch hazel. Then, I made an appointment with my allergy specialist and he said that the tattoo looked great and I was not allergic to the tattoo itself, but the process. He said that I would most likely get this reaction if I get another tattoo, piercing, or even childbirth. He explained that my immune system just needed time to reset itself.

Recurrent UTI could be due to kidney stones, diabetes, dehydration, involvement of upper urinary tract, frequent sexual encounters, etc. I would suggest you carry out ultrasound examination of your abdomen to rule out upper UTI, fasting blood glucose levels to rule out diabetes and carry out culture sensitivity of the organism. Antibiotics will surely clear your infection. It is not contagious but can occur in the sexually active individual due to more chances of mucosal injury. I would advise you take a good quantity of water: Ensure water intake of 2 to 3 liters per day. It will provide a good output of urine. The high output will clear urine infection by flushing action.

And I got rashes on the backside of the body for the last three years.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your query very well. I want to say that watching any video, whether it is sex video or non-sex video for a long period, will have a negative impact on your physique and. Negative impacts can be in the form of a decrease in your vision, mood and behavioral changes, difficulty in concentration, academic difficulties, etc. But I would like to mention a fact here that masturbation is a normal response to sex video or even without sex video, especially at your age. Masturbation does not make you weak, and it has no negative impact on your sexual wellbeing. It will not affect your physique or fitness. At your age it is normal to have an attraction towards females and to overcome this attraction, all of us masturbate, it is a normal phenomenon, not a bad habit or disease like addiction and obsession and never affect your physical health. There is no relation between semen and blood. At your age, almost every male watch sex video and masturbate, so there is no harm in masturbating even daily. Watching sex video is not harmful if you are viewing these videos in limits. The second thing you have asked about some rashes of your backside of the body so think you should consult to a good skin specialist for that as early as possible. So, eat healthily and stay healthy."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, According to my LMP now I am 9 weeks pregnant. I went for USG TV 20 days back and it showed that I was 7 weeks and 2 days and now it would be 8 weeks. USG shown gestational sac with no yolk sac and fetal pole. They said it is BO and to go through D&C. I am confused what to do now. Shall I wait with hope or go through D&C? Please tell me how gestational age will be calculated from LMP or conception day? I am not sure when I ovulated? Please help me out.","Doctor":"Hi. At 6 weeks and beyond we expect a fetal pole or yolk sac to be visualized on USG. By 7 weeks, we must see the cardiac activity. If there is no embryo and no heart beat even beyond 7 weeks, we call it a blighted ovum (BO) with only a sac and no contents inside. It can happen due to a chromosomally abnormal gestation and hence does not survive. It regresses on its own. To date your pregnancy, we calculate period of gestation by LMP (last menstrual period) and then confirm it with an earliest scan within 3 months of pregnancy. In case there is no difference between the two dates or a difference is less than a week, we consider the LMP to calculate the expected date of delivery and period of gestation. Do not worry, you can conceive again. But no hope with this pregnancy. Start Folic Acid 5 mg daily for 3 months before next conception. This will help in a healthy embryo, reduce chance of miscarriage and prevent neural defects in the fetus.

Two to three months ago, I started to have pain on my left testicle whenever I go out as I am usually at home. I speculate that I have varicocele as upon doing a self-examination, I found that the veins were bigger than the other testicle. There were no lumps found, but the left testicle feels bigger than the right one. I would say it is around 5 mm bigger in diameter. I do not have urinary problems like burning sensation. Although when it pains, my left lower abdomen and the pelvic area also hurt sometimes which could be due to lack of exercise as I am on my computer most of the time. The pain or ache on my left testicle usually appears when I am wearing tight pants. But I did not have this problem three months ago. I consulted a general practitioner, and he did a physical check and said it was likely due to congestion of the blood at the testicle. Do you think it could be an infection like epididymitis? I only had sex once in my life with my partner, but I do not have any other symptoms of STD. And do you think that there is something serious? Or is it probably due to congestion or tight pants?","Doctor":"Hello. Testicular pain with no obvious pathology on physical examination is common in young boys. As the testes descend through the lower abdominal wall, they carry spiral muscle which keeps them suspended in a dynamic position. Contraction of these muscles gives rise to pain. Tight pants press on the inguinal canal and may hinder venous return causing congestion. Wearing Langot (cotton strip worn by wrestlers to support testicles in India) will prevent their hanging, so there will be no muscle contraction. Get a USG scrotum (ultrasound). Wear scrotal support (langot). Kindly consult your doctor to discuss the suggestion and take the treatment with concern.

Let me first share a background and then I will come to the problem. I am over 6 feet tall, and my weight presently is about 113 kg. I smoke cigarettes regularly, around 6 to 7 every day, for the past 12 years. I consume alcohol rarely, perhaps once every month or once in two months. I do not exercise as such, but I do walk few kilometers at a stretch sometimes, perhaps once in a week or once in two weeks. Apart from that, I walk a little less than a kilometer almost every day. I have a desk job, but I do move around at brief intervals. I barely need to go out in the sun and stay indoors in AC mostly. I normally have home cooked food for breakfast and dinner. However, I take lunch outside. Apart from this, I normally eat out about once a week, and the food is oily and spicy. I had been diagnosed with low vitamin D around six months ago, following which I had taken Uprise D3 60K once a week for three months on my doctor's prescription. Now, coming to the problem, end of last month, I had a severe headache, which felt like a constant banging inside my head in the night. This headache disappeared when I woke up next morning. However, since then I had a feeling of light-headedness, particularly, while staring at the computer, walking, etc., but not while lying down. I did not feel any weakness. There was no fever, nausea, and dizziness. This feeling of light-headedness lasted for about 4 to 5 days, which subsided and gradually went away. I visited a doctor within a couple of days after this headache, and he asked me to get a lipid profile, creatinine, TSH, and a brain CT scan done. All the results were normal, except LDL was 84, HDL was 37, and triglycerides were 292. It was also found that I have high blood pressure (140/100 mmHg). I was not prescribed any medication on that day for triglycerides but only Amlokind 5 for high BP. I was asked to totally avoid oily, spicy food for 10 days and then have another lipid profile test. I did so, and after 10 days my triglycerides level was found to have dropped to 192 with LDL and HDL having very negligible change. My BP had gone back to 130/80 mmHg. What may have been the cause of such high triglycerides, BP, headaches, and light-headedness? Kindly share such causes also, which are relatively uncommon or rare. Could either of the high BP or high triglycerides have caused the feeling of light-headedness? Can triglycerides be elevated on their own or there must be some underlying cause? If so, what may be such underlying causes? Look forward to a clear and prompt response at the earliest, please.","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, thank you for the beautiful history. Thank you.

I would like to know more about the meaning of these findings. Are streaky opacities associated with malignancy? My key symptom is shortness of breath. I have no coughing, no fever, no sputum, and no hemoptysis. Also, I am an ex-smoker and have just quit smoking for two months (my smoking history: around 20 years, around 20 cigarettes per day).","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below. Streaky opacities scattered in both lung fields means that there might be small straight lung shadows along the air passages on your X-ray on both the sides. These prominent airways in the lungs are seen in both lungs and might be due to some sort of inflammation in the airways or possibly due to changes as a result of any lung infection which you had months to years back. This is not indicative of malignancy but with a history of smoking for 20 years and recent onset breathlessness, it requires detailed evaluation. However, you need to get lung function tests (spirometry) done to know if your lung breathing volume and capacity are within normal limits. Spirometry will also show any reduced breathing capacity that you might have developed due to smoking for 20 years. Your symptoms of shortness of breath might be either due to reduced breathing capacity and exchange of gases in the lungs or due to a heart-related problem. In conclusion, I recommend that you get the lung function tests and an echocardiography is done to confirm that the functioning of lung and heart are within normal range. You can take medicines as given by your doctor and get the X-ray chest repeated after 15 days. If the streaky opacities persist then doing a CT scan chest might be required to study the air passages in detail."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 43 year old male.

Lately, she is acting like crazy, and she is living in constant fear that she will mess up and she visit the toilet in like 10,15, 20 minutes. The morning is starting with toilet and last till she gets tired with that constant going to the bathroom and back to her room, then she goes on half an hour, hour so that continuous going in the toilet with no reason only because of the fear it is stressful and irritating also boring at some point. So the question is is that normal on her age, considering that she has sclerosis dementia, I think. She suffered two brain, and one heart attack should be adapt on her when she is like that and make deals with her because yelling and talking do not have any effect on her mind are focused only on the toilet and on that fear, and it is like a drug to her. It is crazy and funny on the other hand, but in that situation, it is stressful sometimes because it is like dealing with lunation or maniac.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your problem very well and as you have mentioned already here that your grandmother already had two cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or in your language brain attacks and one heart attack and she was diagnosed as sclerosis dementia. As the term suggested dementia it means memory losses, she is suffering from memory disturbances definitely and increase urinary frequency might be due to forgetfulness or it may be due to other neurological deficit which is affecting her bladder also. So first we have to be very, very clear that. Is it urinary incontinence or forgetfulness? So most of the time caregiver became frustrated of these type of symptoms and thinks of craziness or lunacy I believe these are not proper words for your grandmother here. Remember if you are so frustrated because of these symptoms how stressful these for her? In that case, the most important thing you need is a support to your grandmother. The first rule out the cause of increase urinary frequency by making investigations and then will proceed accordingly. So make it clear by consulting her with a good neurologist who can rule out the cause. So before arriving any conclusion, it is very premature for me to comment on current symptoms and treatment option. What I can suggest is environmental support by a caregiver."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I weight 55 kg and height 5 feet 10 inches.

Try the below suggestions if you already have no done it, 1) Try to have a mini-meal or snacks (like boiled cereal sprouts, nuts, etc.) apart from your regular meals. 2) If your level of physical activity is more, accordingly you have to increase your calorie intake. So either limiting the physical activity or increasing the calorie intake necessary to gain weight effectively.  3) Practice drinking some lemon juice before meals, especially for lunch.

I observed I have always inclined towards the negative side of things. Due to recent events, like heartbreak, and age-related illness of parents, feeling extremely negative, exhausted, and feeling difficulty to breathe and loss of appetite are some problems I often face. I am suggested these are panic attacks triggered due to anxiety. Sometimes it is too much. I feel exhausted and want to lay down even though I have not done any tedious task. And now that I recall, I have had these symptoms for over a decade, but since last one year they are noticeable, and the symptoms are louder than ever. Some months back, I had a break-up, and two months later, my mother was admitted to the hospital due to some illness. She is better now, but during that time, I had a constant burning like sensation in the back of my head. Sleeping became impossible, and I was scared to sleep alone, I stopped using the phone two hours before sleep and meditated starting from five minutes a day to 15 minutes in one stretch. The burning sensation always stayed for 10 to 12 days, and then it became occasional, and later it was gone.

When you develop better coping mechanisms, you will be able to manage stress more effectively. Try to exercise regularly. It lifts your mood and lowers your anxiety.

Before a year, when the severity of the depression was stronger than now, I did not breathe and the emergency staff gave me oxygen. How to make myself relax? I am really trying to calm down. I am telling myself not to fear and relax without thinking anything. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. I read your query and understand your concerns. I am glad to know that you are willing to take necessary steps for avoiding similar problems of depression, which had crippled you last year. Although all kinds of behavioral intervention need personal interaction and complete assessment, but deep breathing is the one, which can be used in any situations without much effort. When you feel something is wrong do deep breathing. Allow a single breath of in and out around 10-15 seconds. This will help you to control the tiredness and fatigue. Secondly, keep yourself hydrated. Take at least four to five liters of water every day, including the day of travel. Thirdly, ensure proper sleep if possible. If you are not able to sleep properly without medication, then consult your specialist doctor and ask for a prescription.

So, please do not scare me more here, but could you please advice me and tell me if the danger I am thinking about is something to worry about or nothing at all. Everyone knows carbon monoxide is dangerous and car exhaust produces this dangerous gas. But we cannot fully protect against this environment gas, while every car in the country runs on it. Yesterday we were in a car center, looking for a brand new car to buy, and inside this car center (fearly small) they showed us a car, and they did start the engine inside (gasoline), to show us the backing camera. This was a brand new car, and it did run for about 20 to 30 seconds. And after this, we did talk in the same room for about 1 to 2 minutes. Then we did go out. I did not feel any strange smell and after six hours I did not feel any symptoms. This morning I feel very tired and I think it is because I have been thinking about this over and over in my head. My wife who was with me, do not feel anything and she did not even say a word about this. When we read on the internet, we can read all the danger about this, and I just want to know if this will make any damage to my body or not.","Doctor":"Hi. You have the answer \\"I think it is because I have been thinking about this over and over in my head\\". Generally, it is true that environmental toxicity (air pollutions or water pollutions) are increasing that directly affects our health. If you have a respiratory allergy or skin allergy due to pollutions, then it should be taken special care. Otherwise, nothing to worry. In your case, I am 100 % sure that your tiredness is not due to the pollution. Usually, people who are working in the pollution area for a long period, only then they will suffer. Usually, our body is capable of handling pollution issues to a certain level. You may do some positive things about it such as: a) Pranayama practice daily morning - to purify the lung. b) You may maintain interior plants (within your room, office, house) to give more oxygen. c) You may check the air pollution level of your living city (through government health office). If pollution is more, you may shift to another village or city having less pollution.  Moreover, you be confident that your body has the capablity of fighting against pollution. That confidence is helpful for mental peace. You can consume more vegetables and fruits (natural detoxifier) to maintain your health."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My baby is 3-month-old she was having a fever now with a weight of 5.8 kg. What should I give to gain more weight and look humpty she looks too much weak also.","Doctor":"Hello. 5.8 at three months is fine. The child should not be Humpty. A good weight is must, not under or over. If she had a fever, the most common is viral fever characterized by fever and nasal discharge with or without mild cough, and child will be active otherwise. If she does not have all these features, it could be other infection also, for that we need to discuss by direct conversation. 1. If it looks like viral fever, give her only Paracetamol syrup 4 ml three times a day along with frequent breastfeeding and monitoring of the temperature. 2. Give her breastfeed exclusively up to six months. 3. After six months start on cereal supplements, and report with weight so that we can decide how much to be given. 4. Complete vaccination.

Allergens can vary from climate to food habits. Initially, you will have to take steps in skipping those trigger factors which are responsible for asthma. Certain food items can trigger asthma. Usually, these are hard to identify as the reaction comes probably after a day or two. At this stage, however, I suggest you begin the intake of two medicines. They are as follows. 1.

Feelings and symptoms like palpitations, getting a heart attack, difficulty breathing, digestive concerns, and sleep problems can be a part of heart-related issues or anxiety. It is essential to have some physical examinations before taking medicines. Also, first time medicine can be prescribed after a physical exam. At first, you must need to get proper assessment identifying the cause of this anxiousness, whether it is work-related or some personal issue. It can be done by analyzing thought processes when you are having such symptoms. After analyzing thoughts, cognitive behavior therapy thought channelization, and restructuring is quite helpful. Besides, to make yourself relax you can do the following, 1. Deep breathing excercises. 2. Walk for at least 30 minutes per day. 3. Workout if possible to release toxins out of your body. 4. Reduce smoking (if you do). 5. Avoid junk and spicy food, soft drinks. 6. Increase water intake. 7.

Sometimes both the conditions can be present together as well. There is no specific test or scan or investigation to distinguish these two conditions but a thorough history and mental state examination will help to identify the correct course. So it will involve your psychiatrist asking you lots of questions to elicit your mental state, questions about your life, personal and family history which will help with making a diagnosis. As you know, BPD is a personality disorder, and bipolar is a mood disorder. So detailed history and mental state examination can help to make the distinction. I will recommend you to keep a file of all your reports, including the previous reports related to diagnosing you with BPD and share it with your psychiatrist during your next follow-up appointment. I see that you have prescribed Lithium which is a very useful mood stabilizer. Discuss your medication response and any persistent concerns with your prescribing doctor so that he can review accordingly.

I have read through your query and here is my opinion. Some women do suffer from constipation during pregnancy, and it may extend up to the postpartum period. Proper diet and intake of lots of fluids are essential. Bleeding through the anus is not right, and therefore, constipation has to be treated.

I believe the reason you were started on birth control pill was because you already had irregular menses, and the physician must have advised you to continue it for at least six months. Also when you started your periods seemed to be regular for two months, but when you stopped it you reverted to your earlier state of oligomenorrhoea. This situation points mostly towards polycystic ovarian syndrome. I would suggest you undergo an ultrasound to check the size of ovaries and the endometrial thickness (ET).

My present AMH value is 1.1 ng/ml. A blood test was taken last week. Shall I still proceed for a fresh IVF/ICSI cycle?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Definitely, IVF would be the best option. Let me start by mentioning the risk factors, one is your age, AMH is lower limit and endometriosis. As you cross 35 years, most of the good eggs get exhausted. So it is very good to keep getting lots of egg and embryos for transfer. The best part of your history is that you did get pregnant twice, unfortunately, the final result was not good. Hope semen report is normal. Options, if I may suggest: 1. Have IVF again, but let the doctor try different hormones and altering the doses. 2. Have IVF from a different center. The grading you are mentioning is what the doctor suggested. I had a patient. Husband had testis FNAC, they had mentioned of getting 8 blasts and 3 morulae. They told her that two blasts are being transferred every cycle, but negative results. It is impossible to get so many blasts from TEFNA sample as sperms are so unhealthy. 3. Repeat AMH within 14 days of period again from a different laboratory. 4. If AMH is below 1 ng/ ml think about a donor egg. Main advantages are endometriosis and your age would not affect the quality of eggs. Do not lose hope, you have lost two pregnancies between cup and lip, if you will not retry now, your good age and remaining eggs will be exhausted. So do try IVF again."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been masturbating on a daily basis for a long time.

The symptoms are beginning to fade. As well, I am also dealing with dysphoria, transgender symptoms and would like to get on Testosterone.","Doctor":"Hello. It is good to know that depression and anxiety symptoms are fading and you are feeling better on Prozac (Fluoxetine). You need to continue taking Prozac till further advice by your prescribing doctor. Regarding gender dysphoria, you will need a comprehensive assessment by a specialist team following which you will be put on a step-wise treatment approach. Assessment will include the age at which you started having gender identity issues, nature and severity of symptoms, history from parents, etc. So, I will advise you to discuss with your parents, family and see your doctor who can refer you on for further assessment at gender clinic."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 21-year-old. My question is whenever I have an orgasm, the muscles and veins on my chest goes down, my arms get weaker and give difficulties breathing at night. I am always spitting out bloody snorts and having trouble in swallowing properly for few days, or sometimes even few weeks I thought it was asthma or acid reflux, but been to different hospitals to get a check and neither one of them seem to know what the problem is. I would love to know what is going on if you can help.","Doctor":"Hello.  First of all, I feel that there is some problem in either your lungs, heart, or blood. Weakness with difficulty in breathing after orgasm indicates that your stamina is less. The cause for low stamina can be some problem in your blood or lungs or heart. Spitting out bloody snorts and difficulty swallowing means there is some problem in your esophagus (food pipe) either an ulcer or erosion or vascular problem, for which you shall require an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. You also need other tests, but I would like to go through the reports of the analysis done on you. Kindly upload the test reports."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I need advice regarding my child vaccination. I am moving abroad, and the treatments are pending. My kid has completed one year.","Doctor":"Hello. 1. By one year of age, a child should have received birth vaccines like BCG (bacilli Calmette-Guerin), polio drops. Then three monthly shots of DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus), Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b), polio injection and hepatitis B. 2. By nine months measles vaccine should be given. 3. Optional vaccines include rotavirus, pnemococcal and influenza vaccines. You have not mentioned which vaccines are pending. Some places have specific recommendations. 1 to 5 years MMR (mumps, measles, and rubella), chickenpox and hepatitis A vaccines along with booster doses of DPT, Hib, polio would be there. It is recommended that you at least complete the vaccines required up to one year of age, if not given already."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a bump on the right backside of the roof of my mouth. It is right next to the tooth that is farther back. It has pain when I brush my tongue over it. Also giving me a slight headache and earache. I recently went to the dentist for a cleaning, and they said my wisdom teeth were not even showing so what could this be?","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query, and it seems that the bump which is painful and which gives radiating pain to ear and head is because of your third molar and this tooth is infected as the food gets entrapped between the tooth and soft tissue covering that tooth. For this, avoid eating too hot or too cold. Wash out oral cavity after every meal with mouthwash and warm saline. Do not apply external heat to that area, especially keeping your hand on that area. Also, take antibiotic and painkiller. Antibiotic you can use is Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid combination in 625 mg dosage bd. Painkiller can be Ultracet ((tramadol and acetaminophen) thrice a day."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 17-year-old with height 5'8\\" and weight 118. My doctor has clinically diagnosed me with narcolepsy. He said that I show every sign and symptom I did not meet the requirements on the MSLT. He believes that I still have it. He did blood work, and my iron and vitamin C came back low. He wants to do a spinal tap, if that comes back fine does that mean I do not have narcolepsy. Also, what does clinically diagnosed mean?","Doctor":"Hello. Most of the diagnosis is made based on the patient's history of complaints, examination done by the doctor and supported by investigations. The investigations most of the time play a crucial role for example if I suspect diabetes in a patient and his blood sugar test reports come normal, then my diagnosis needs to be changed. But for certain diseases, there are no tests which will confirm or refute the diagnosis.  Narcolepsy is one such disease. So what your doctor is doing is he is testing for other illnesses which mimic as narcolepsy. And if tests come normal, he concludes as narcolepsy based only on your symptoms and his examination and not on test reports. That is the meaning of clinically diagnosing. If you can tell me your symptoms, I can help you in diagnosis."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 2.5-year-old daughter ate one tablet of Qutan 25 mg (Quetiapine). What should we do now?","Doctor":"Hello. This is an antipsychotic drug causing side effects after prolonged use or acute side effect due to consumption in a large amount. She took this drug in a small amount that is in range of normal dose. If she did not have any side effect, you need to do anything. Common side effects are headache, generalized weakness, drowsiness, restlessness, dizziness. Fatigue tremor, abnormal movements, dry mouth, constipation, increased heart rate, palpitations, postural and orthostatic hypotension, blurred vision, sweating, skin rash, eruption, fever, and flu-like symptoms. Unlikely, but if she developed symptoms, you need to report to your nearest pediatrician. Kindly keep these drug in a safe place out of reach to your kids.

My two months old baby was normal, healthy, happy, smiling. One fine day morning, I walked over to get him and noticed abnormal breathing inhaling but not exhaling. His body was solid gray and unresponsive.I immediately called emergency service. He was transported to an emergency room. He is in a coma, on life support, the red blood cell count is dropping, fluid on his brain, having seizures, and his blood pressure was at 320 when he was transported. They have run every test for primary infections plus more, and all comes back negative. The pediatric unit has never seen anything like this. They have contacted other specialist, and there has been no diagnosis. If anyone might have any clue of what it could be, please help me. We want him to come home and return to our happy lives.","Doctor":"Hello. With the information you have given, I would try to analyze his condition. First, turning gray or blue means the oxygen levels in his body are low. Reasons could be many. From what you mentioned. He seems to be bleeding in the brain, that is why his red blood cells are coming down. Bleed in the brain also causes seizures and high blood pressure. Or sometimes high blood pressure itself can cause seizures, but the number 320 is very odd, I do not know if it is that much. This condition could be due to 1) infection, 2) Abnormal bleeding disorders, where the body cannot stop the bleeding process, due to deficiency of some factors responsible for it. It needs special tests. Ex; late hemorrhagic disease, deficiency of factors 8, 9, etc. 3) High BP could be because of the bleed itself, or high BP could have caused the bleeding, then reasons for high BP should be looked for.this needs special tests and scans, hormonal tests also. 4) Bleeding can be controlled by given FFP, cryoprecipitate in specific conditions. I know I can only provide you information, because the condition is serious, requiring a lot of tests, and treatment is not so simple. He needs treatment to control the bleeding, control BP, seizures. It involves a few specialties and can be life-threatening also."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am asking for help to identify what is the things happen on me.

I appreciate your courage to share and seek for help. It seems that you are experiencing self-esteem issues due to being body-shamed and other stressors and challenges of life. That is why gradually you are becoming withdrawal from your friends and social activities. It seems you try to be a part of them, but at some moment you feel empty and cannot share things in a better way that makes you feel sad and lonely.

I am having nasal congestion for 10 days now and have taken Niacin and Kaasahara syrup for the past four days, but there is no improvement before that I tried Allopathy. Please suggest if the medication what I am taking is fine and should continue, or else suggest alternate medicine.","Doctor":"Hello. The medicines you are taking are mostly for cough, and not for nasal congestion. I suggest, 1. Haridra khanda one teaspoon mixed with one teaspoon honey, taken a day after food thrice. 2. Anu thailam 2 drops in each nostril, twice a day. When you put this nasal drop, it may come to your throat in which case spit it out. If you swallow it mistakenly, it is fine as it is harmless. 3.

Based on your query, my opinion is as follows: For further doubts consult a hematologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 26-year-old male. Since one year, I have experienced that foreskin on my penis is usually swollen, I was initially over cleaning it, but then I read that irritates the skin more so I stopped applying soap. The swelling is visible only when the penis is erect, and I pull down the foreskin, the foreskin forms a ring under the glans neck, and the frenulum also seems tight or swollen. It is difficult to pull back foreskin when erect, it hurts, but if I use lube or oil, it does not hurt at all. I have also observed the head of the penis, around meatus is slightly dark, this darkness is visible only when not erect, when erect, the head seemed uniformly colored. I am concerned more because I experienced oral sex months back, and after a few minutes, the pulling back of foreskin during oral sex was hurting, it was with a known person, the skin felt sensitive for three to four days after that, I applied Beta mil GM cream and it was fine, the sensitivity was gone, however this swelling has always been there, even before the sexual experience. So I am confident this swelling rose after sex for a few days, but it was already there. I am not diabetic, and as per 1-week old general body test, all my vitals seem normal. I have attested pictures, for other details, I do not have an erectile problem, I am not sexually active, in fact after the last oral sex experience I thought not to engage until I have a green pass from the doctor. I am 5.10 tall, and weight 68 kg.","Doctor":"Hello. It seems on the picture you have mild short frenulum. It usually not possible to retract prepuce in the erect state, so it is normal slight discoloration around meatus is normal. You can continue the use of ointment. Avoid pulling the skin too much back in an erect or flaccid state. In the picture, it does not look like that it will require any surgery. In rare cases where retracted skin cannot be pulled back, a condition called paraphimosis then, doctor help for reduction may be required. The only indication for surgery for the tight prepuce is if, too much discomfort and pain during sexual activity. If you have more query, you can ask."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Had pterygium for 4 to 5 years in the right eye, and in the left eye for two years. It was treated with eye drops, but I do not remember the name. I have not taken the drops in more than a year. The recommendation now is for surgery, so I am seeking a second opinion, preferably with someone who can view the photographs and offer a treatment option.","Doctor":"Hello. I saw the photos, and although they are not of high quality, I can still determine the borders of the pterygium. Usually, pterygiums are operated on if they have crossed the white border of the eye, have reached the central part and are causing visual problems such as blurry or diminished vision. The other reason is cosmetical and if the patient asks for the surgery. Pterygium is a chronic process during which the lesion starts to grow due to different reasons like continuous exposure to the sun, dry eye, etc. Therefore the decision of whether to do surgery or not is up to you because even after surgery, it might reoccur if the main reasons persist. There is no dedicated treatment for it, and we usually prescribe steroids to reduce the inflammation along with artificial tears to keep the eye lubricated. I would advise you to use the following, 1. Lotemax eye drops or alternative one drop three times daily for 10 days (make sure you shake the vial well before using it in case of lotemax ) and any artificial tears one drop 4 to 5 times daily in a continuous manner (do not use it before going to sleep). After 10 days you can reassess it yourself an decide whether you want to do the surgery or not."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I had the ACL reconstruction surgery of my right knee before five years. At the same time, the medial meniscus was completely repaired and lateral meniscus partially repaired. After some time doctor opened my bandage and the knee was healed nicely. I had been advised to do some physical exercise (such as extension, flexion, etc.) and I was doing the same correctly up to nine days.But unfortunately, my knee started swelling, and the doctor advised not to do any physical exercise and did some medical examination. As appeared from the report, there was no infection found from culture and sensitivity tests of fluid. Although it is found that my ESR was little high, i.e. 40 and C -Reactive protein was 14.5. However, the latest medical examination revealed that ESR is 35, and C-Reactive protein is 2.5. Doctor advised me some antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin and Flucloxacillin), and I took the same. It has seven (07) weeks have passed. Still, there is swelling in my knee, and I could not do any exercise. Now, I feel stiffness and move with the assist of an elbow stick. My daily activities are hampering a lot, and I am getting frustrated day by day. Therefore, I would earnestly request you to advise me proper medications so that I can get back to daily life properly.","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly were you running fever three weeks post-surgery? Secondly, your first ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein) were raised, but within my comfort zone as post-surgery, they will usually be built up to six weeks to three months. The second report showed a good downtrend. Additionally, the culture was negative. I would not have started you on antibiotics unless you had,  1) Wound discharge. 2) Fever more than 101 F. 3) Redness and swelling and pain are worsening with each day. 4) Fatigue and loss of appetite. I would have ICED the knee and put you on a gentle ROM exercise program to combat stiffness and asked you to keep the compression bandage on when not exercising to get the swelling down and kept you on anti-inflammatories till your knee subsided and then started strengthening exercises. Seven weeks down the line stiff knee and no proven infection, you have an uphill task now to combat stiffness, and at the same time, you are worried if the swelling will return. My worry here is are we sure that the repair is good and nothing is loose and floating in the joint and causing the symptoms. Also is the ACL repaired in the right place as misplaced ACL will lead to pain and swelling if it in the right place. Please upload your MRI and latest post-op AP and lateral digital X-rays of the knee to get some idea about the tunnel placement."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Can you identify the buckle fracture location in my son's X-ray? Please see the attached files. I am interested in understanding the location and severity of the buckle fracture.","Doctor":"Hello. Your attending doctors may have already informed you that buckle fractures are not of any severity. This is because the bones of the child are pliable enough so that the bone saves itself by buckling rather than breaking altogether. Treatment is quite simple and straightforward. Most cases recover satisfactorily with only immobilization and on-demand painkillers. Regarding the location of the buckle, I should quite honestly say that I do not see it. Indeed, pediatric fractures in general, and buckle fractures, in particular, are often quite subtle and may be detected only by a super specialized and experienced pediatric radiologist. However, this is, in a sense, good news for you, given the fact that a subtle buckle fracture would heal more completely and rapidly than an obvious one."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,Please see my attached files and advised me that my radius bone is healing in alignment or not. My fracture is 20 days old, and plaster is opened swelling and pain in these areas. I doubt that my bone is not in alignment.","Doctor":"Hello. You are right, and the radius is out of alignment. The dorsal angulation appears to be 15 degrees. This is eyeballing, and I may be off by a few degrees, but the position is not acceptable in a young person, again I am assuming that you are less than 40 years of age and this is your right hand. Secondly, in the AP view the radial translation is acceptable, and so is the shortening. Clinically the wrist may look unshapely when compared with the opposite side if this is obvious and now 20 days down the line it can still be manipulated and put into a molded plaster as further delay will mean that the fracture will need a surgical procedure to improve alignment. I do not know why did they remove the plaster at 20 days as the plaster should be on for at least four to five weeks."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,My wife is 14 weeks pregnant. Since yesterday night, she has been suffering with severe left hip pain.

But during the day I do not have this problem. Also, I have done the gammagraphy test for my intestinal transit rate, and it was the three times higher the range but at night.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query, and from what you have mentioned, it appears that you have idiopathic gastroparesis. You might benefit from a highly specialized gastroenterologist consultation for consideration of gastric pacemaker or gastric electrical stimulation. Gastric electrical stimulation (GES) uses a small, battery-powered device to send mild electrical pulses to the nerves and muscles in the lower stomach.  A surgeon puts the device under the skin in your lower abdomen and attaches wires from the device to the muscles in the wall of your stomach. GES can help decrease long-term nausea and vomiting. GES is used to treat people with gastroparesis due to diabetes or unknown causes only, and only in people whose symptoms cannot be controlled with medicines. Check with your gastroenterologist for further details. I hope you find my advice beneficial."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My dad had a scraping of his bladder two months ago, it was extremely painful afterward, supposed to be a day surgery, he had to spend next two days in the hospital, with horrific bladder spasms. When he came home, he has had numerous, constant UTIs and also a kidney infection more weeks going to the hospital for IV antibiotics, and now again on antibiotics at home for another UTI. His bladder cancer is in the earliest of stages.His surgeon most likely wants to scrape 1 or 2 more times. He said he maybe got 70 percent of it the first time. I do not wish to my dad to go through more pain and complications. What can you recommend? Should he be monitored and if it gets into the wall later have his bladder removed?","Doctor":"Hello. The bladder spasm could be due to infection, coexisting enlarged prostate, or any intra-bladder chemo medicine given after surgery. Treating his disease is the first step. Urine cultures will help. Giving anticholinergics is next step to relax the bladder. The third will be to do a uroflow if not done and treat his prostate if there is any obstruction to flow. You may send any reports if you have them. Removing the bladder is a valuable exercise and is the last resort for superficial tumors. For deep tumors or recurrent tumors, there is no other option but the removal of bladder or radiotherapy. Better to preserve the bladder and treat tumor endoscopically if it is not deep or aggressive. For symptomatic relief, you may ask for Pyridium tablets (Phenazopyridine) or Amitryptylline as a temporary measure to reduce the burning."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am always bitten by mosquitoes. I am the only person who is bitten here in our house. The insect bite remains red for days, then will eventually turn dark. I want to ask is there something in my blood? And what remedies can I use to lighten my scars?","Doctor":"Hello. To understand why mosquitoes do bite you always, you should know what attracts them to get you bitten: 1. CO2 production as per metabolic rate because mosquitoes are attracted by it. 2. Obese, overweight people with low metabolic rate. 3. Wearing dark clothes. 4. Mosquitoes do tend to bite when it is dawn, when it is high humidity and less windy, so try to use a fan at that time to keep them away.

I have seen the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and would like to confirm that this is a particular fungal infection with normal whitish flaky skin over a localized region and scaling present along with the classical sign of itching present.

Is it a wrong way of doing? I do not get excited during sex and unable to ejaculate. Only, rubbing the tip of the penis gives me excitement.

It only reduces the inflammation but bumps are not reducing. I also have pigmentation caused by acne before. What may be the reason? I usually get cystic acne bumps on my cheeks. The acne clears and comes again. I have red pigmentation caused by acne. Can you recommend product for acne and pigmentation as well for controlling further breakouts. I want to know which sunscreen and moisturizer to use?","Doctor":"Hello. This provisional advice provided by me stands subject to the actual examination of report or image (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and is based entirely on inputs provided to me. It should be correlated with clinical findings. You should know that you are in your teens and getting acne is a common thing. What we are concentrating is the acne should go away easily without leaving any scars of pigmentation. For that I suggest you use a good daily face cleanser like Spongy Sal foaming face wash.Do not rub your face after applying it. Just spread it evenly, gently and wash it off. Never use soap for cleaning face. Do this once during the day and once at night. After cleansing the face at night apply Epiduo gel over the acne (Adapalene and Benzoyl peroxide) and apply gently until gel absorbs in skin. Do not massage or rub too vigorously. You will experience some itching early on but do not worry. The gel will dry up the acne and it will be late off. Avoid going in the sun directly or if you have to wear a good sunblock off about SPF 50 plus and then go. This is the treatment as of now for your acne.Follow this for two weeks and give me a follow up. Then I will consider starting other medication gradually as you get more familiarized with the acne treatment. Hope you follow this regimen carefully and do not stop or overmedicate by yourself."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,For as many years as I can remember I have these red bumps on my knuckles on the top of my hand.

I am wondering if I have a tic disorder, or if it might be the beginning of Tourette's syndrome. Kindly advice.","Doctor":"Hello. Tics are relatively common and experienced by many people. If you are having both motor and vocal tics which are persistent for more than a year, it becomes a chronic tic disorder- commonly referred to as Tourette's syndrome. How old are you now? At what age did these tics start?  Tics are usually more prominent when you are feeling tired, stressed, etc. I will advise consulting with your doctor for a full assessment (physical causes may need to rule out in some situations). If tics are affecting your normal functioning, it can be treated by habit reversal therapy, and sometimes medication can be used as well. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 37-year-old female. For the past couple of weeks, I have foot ache and feel a cold tingling sensation on and off.

You seem to have got Berloque dermatitis (those reddish-brown patches) (attachment removed to protect patient identity) due to sun exposure after some perfume or fragrance or plant contact on the skin (phytophotodermatitis) which typically causes these irregular and odd-looking patches.

It does not happen all the time, but it is frequent. When I swallow food or liquid, there is no pain. I feel that the pain originates somewhere behind the skin of the soft palate, or within the soft palate itself. When touching that region with my finger, there is no pain. I do not see any redness in the back of my mouth, and generally, I do not see any irregularities. However, this is not a doctor, but me viewing. Also, I noticed that the arc of the right-hand side soft palate is a bit dropped compared to the one on the left-hand side. I do not know if this condition was present before (I never paid attention to that) or is something that I have for a while, or since birth. I am 51 and have regular yearly medical exams (complete blood work, biomarkers, abdomen, prostate, etc.). I do not take any medications. So far, I have been a healthy man. Any advice is welcome. Any suggestions on what to check, look, or do, too. I am asking for advice because I do not have at the moment medical insurance. I will be back at home in three months.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen the pictures, and your oral cavity seems to be normal. Can you highlight the area where you have pain? Do you have acidity? Generally in any infection of the oral cavity or larynx pain is more while swallowing saliva than swallowing solid bland food or liquid.

Five months later, my symptoms were getting worse, and my doctor rechecked me after five months TSH was 7.40, and free T4 was 0.9. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Which would explain my weight gain, hair loss, fatigue, etc. Why was there a change in my TSH? She put me on 100 mcg of Levothyroxin and 500 mg of Metformin, and I had two ultrasounds of my ovaries (outside and inside), and they were fine. She also told me my Prolactin levels were at 31.4. What does that mean? She told me to come back in six weeks to get it all retested then promptly went on vacation.","Doctor":"Hello. Elevated Prolactin means the concentration of Prolactin hormones in your blood is high. Prolactin is a hormone secreted by the pituitary in the brain. It controls the action of sex hormones. It can be elevated due to problems either in your pituitary or in your ovaries. You require an evaluation for that. TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) values keep changing even in normal persons. It depends on physical activity, the rate of metabolism in the body. When tested initially, you might have been in the starting stage of hypothyroidism, and hence the TSH value came normal. After a few months, the hypothyroidism progressed, and hence your TSH got raised. I hope this answers your query. Any clarifications or questions feel free to ask. I am happy to help you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have lowering (variable) neutrophil for past two years. The count is like 2.6, 2.3, 2.0, 2.43, 1.91 being recent, which is lower than usual.

Your absolute neutrophil count is borderline low in the recent report. In the value of the previous description was within the range that is more than two. So it cannot be called persistent neutropenia because the normal range is more than two. Anyway, your peripheral smear examination report does not show any abnormal cells. So the chance of leukemia is very less according to the mentioned report and peripheral smear examination report. The repeated cold can be responsible for an increase in lymphocytes and so relative neutropenia can be seen. I hope I have answered your question.

I am suffering from a very bad sex life due to very low sex interest of my husband. To tell about the past, we had a long courtship period of 1-1/2 years in which I was able to understand from his conversations that he has very low interest in sex. I ignored that and got married to him. Right after our marriage, we had sex daily and then it started reducing gradually. The frequency fell drastically from having sex once in a week to once in 15 days. Whenever I tried to initiate or have a word with him about it, he said that a man needs to be very free to have sex and busy people generally have low sexual engagements. I know that it is not true and I believe that he gives some excuse to his own weakness. Now, at the end of one year of our marriage, the sex has reduced to once in a month. So, you can understand the level of frustration I have landed into, which is severely affecting my own personal health and interest in staying with him. He hardly gets aroused once in many days and does not react sexually even after I make advancements. He does not react, does not understand and most importantly, not able to enter me without putting a condom. He says he gets support with the condom. So, the second issue you can understand is that with that condom I cannot conceive also. He has very low interest in anything related to sex and he is not able to enter me properly as he says it hurts him. Otherwise, he is such a loving husband and its tough for me to believe that he does not want to make love to his wife for any other reason. I would like to tell you that he does not have a separate skin from the shaft, it rather covers the shaft and that pretty much indicates he even masturbates very less. Could you please help me? Could you please tell me if this is normal with some men? Does the case of my husband look abnormal? What are the tests that he must get done to affirm that he suffers from sex issues or low testosterone? What line of treatment should I take him to? Thanks in advance. Please help me as this is ruining my personal health and would probably push our marriage to the end of divorce as my family knows about it now and does not want me to stay in a marriage with a man who cannot keep me physically happy and still not accept he has some issues. Thank you so much.","Doctor":"Hi.

In one study, it was found to be helpful in anxiety disorders and have some effect in reducing daytime sleepiness. But it is one study, and with only that, I would not advise its use. My opinion is for choosing a less sedating drug, or that does not induce sleep (as prothiaden can induce some sleep). Such a drug can be Serta 50 mg (Sertraline) once daily in the morning.

Acne depends on hormonal effects, sebaceous secretion, etc. It reduces with age in both severity and appearance, and good control can be achieved by regular face wash with a cleanser like Cetaphil, topical keratolytic like Retinoic acid creams and antibiotics like Clindamycin, if necessary oral antibiotics. Treat if dandruff with Ketoconazole shampoos like the scalp. Do not use any creams and do not rub or use harsh soaps to dry skin as they sometimes increase it on the contrary. Oily skin can predispose to acne. It is better to avoid oil-rich foods and high glycemic foods.

The previous history shows you have oily and acne-prone skin, and this time you have a severe breakout. In my opinion, Isotretinoin 20 mg is the required dose, and it will take six weeks to show its response. Moreover during this six weeks sometimes flared up response is seen. In some cases, acne does get exacerbated. Initial ten mg was a little bit under dosage, so do not count that period. Please continue to take it as such as you will have maximum improvement within three months. Try to avoid stress as acne always get aggravated.

Size of the penis varies from person to person, like other physical features like height, etc. On an average, it ranges from 3.5 inches to 5.5 inches on erection. Your penis is within this range on erection, so do not worry. In pornographic films, they show big penis by injecting drugs, etc., which is harmful. So most people have wrong ideas about penis size.

It is common to feel stressed following a break-up in any relationship. Usually one gets better with time, but you are reporting the ongoing stressful situation. It will get better with support. 2. Have you spoken about your difficult situation with any family member or friends? Try to open up and have an honest discussion with a trusted person who can understand and support you. 3. It does not help that the ex-guy is trying to defame you. Try to ignore him and see whether his actions die off. Block his contacts. Try to stay off social media for some time until everything calms down. If he continues to harass you, try to warn him formally. Take help from family and friends instead of handling it alone. 4. Try not to worry about the current stressful situation. You will come out of it as a wiser person. Try to stay positive. Focus on long term goals. Try to exercise regularly to help you to relax. Distract yourself by listening to your favorite music, watching TV, movies, etc. 5.

Is it possible to withdraw? If so, how? Someone told me that taking 5 mg Xanax daily for eight years is not even harming or benefiting the system because my system got used to it and because it is a low dose. Is that right?","Doctor":"Hello. Xanax 0.5 mg dose is not high. The drug is a rapid action Benzodiazepine drug and helps to reduce the anxiety symptoms. Abrupt stoppage of a drug after regularly taking for years might lead to withdrawal symptoms and precipitation of panic and insomnia. So it is advisable to reduce the dose of the drug slowly over about four weeks. Gradual dose reduction would not cause withdrawal symptoms. Reduce the doses by about 25 % every second week, and this will prevent the withdrawal symptoms. The drug is safe to use and can be used for long but should be used under regular supervision of a doctor only."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am a 42-year-old male, having normal physic, weight 65 kg.

If you feel that you are not able to do your work efficiently or you think you are weak, then you can start using these products to build your weight.

The symptoms you describe could be consistent with a cervical disc problem but are not specific to how severe it might be. Numbness of the face is usually associated with disc problems in the neck, although I have seen patients complain about it in the past. The physical examination of your nerve function is essential.  If you had signs of spinal cord compression, increased reflexes in the legs, weakness, or difficulty controlling bowel or bladder function, then there is urgency in seeing a neurosurgeon. If the MRI shows signs of spinal cord compression, then there is also some urgency in seeing a neurosurgeon. If only a nerve root is involved, then sometimes these problems can be treated conservatively first if you send the report of the MRI and perhaps a photo of it that would be more helpful."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My left lower eyelid is swelled for more than two months, and recently a few days back, I noticed, my left upper eyelid also got swelled.

You can start by not using them anymore if you are. To relieve yourself from the swelling, please use Lotemax (Loteprednol Etabonate) eye drops one drop three times daily for 10 days. You cannot use it when you are wearing your lenses and should shake the bottle well before using it. Also and since you are contact lens user, you might want to lubricate the eyes with artificial tears, one drop four times daily even when you are using the lenses. If the symptoms do not subside within five days, please upload some good quality photos of your eyes or visit the ophthalmologist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My wife for 18 years no longer finds me attractive. Not physically but mentally. That is I no longer turn her on because I let her down, have lied and been lazy over the last years. She had already made her mind up to leave me before I knew we had a problem. For the children's sake, she has agreed to go into therapy but admits she does not see much hope of rekindling the lost passion and I am not 100 % convinced that she wants to. We are great friends, hang out a lot together, fitness, date nights, concerts, festivals, etc. We rarely argue, have no money issues, drug or drink abuse or violence. Is there any realistic chance that counseling can turn this around?","Doctor":"Hello. You have already taken the first step of acknowledging the problem and trying to address it. You have to gradually rebuild the trust, which is crucial for the survival of any relationship. You have admitted to letting your wife down and lying to her, which could have significantly contributed to your wife's negative feelings towards the relationship. It is difficult to comment further without knowing your wife's perspective. Couples therapy or marital therapy can potentially help to salvage the relationship. As you may know, you cannot predict success in all the cases, but I have personally seen several families benefitting from the intervention. I will advise you to attend therapy sincerely and take it from there. Make sure that your wife does not feel pressurized in doing things against her wishes. It is interesting to note that you are still great friends, and there are no significant conflicts involved. Did your wife not challenge you when you were lying and let her down? Has she internalized all her worries, anger instead of talking about them with you openly and seek a resolution? Therapy can help to find common ground and how to handle emotionally difficult scenarios. Marital therapy can come across as challenging but will be helpful. Continue with fun activities together as a family. I hope this helps. You can contact again if any further advice is needed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am 66 years old.

What can be done, and is there any danger to my sight?","Doctor":"Hello. I fear that you have severe dry eye and using artificial tears will not be enough. First of all, you should start using the artificial tears every hour during the day and last time about an hour or 30 minutes before sleep. You could also try using a thicker type of lubrication such as eye gel when you have significant visual activities. Last but not least, you might want to get a prescription for Restasis (Cyclosporine), the only existing treatment of the dry eye.

It is in the lower intestine but has not moved for several days. Today at the hospital, the surgeon said they would not attempt a colonoscopy or any procedure. If it remains in the intestine for 30 days, (as long as no infection), then they will remove it. Is this normal procedure for a metal magnet?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, what is described by the surgeon is right. However, I would advise for you to feed the child more of bananas so that it may help to push the magnet out. In such a case, we need to watch out for any intestinal obstruction that may result due to the magnet. This can develop at any time and may result in an emergency. The warning signs for you should be abdominal distention, excessive vomiting episodes of undigested or semi-digested food particles and the child not passing stools at all, severe abdominal pain, and the sudden collapse of the child. Any of these signs occur, it is an emergency, and the child should be taken to the nearest hospital immediately. Also, you should watch out for any fever episodes with any form of the clinical worsening of the child's condition. If these signs do not occur, it is advisable to monitor the position of the magnet either daily or on alternate day basis by doing an x-ray abdomen. In most cases, the magnet usually comes out on its own without any external intervention. However, in very rare circumstances, a response based on the position of the magnet in the intestine is performed if the magnet stays inside for long periods or if any of the signs mentioned above develop."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, We had unprotected intercourse 13 days back.

I am a virgin, but I masturbate quite a bit. Before, it was around at least once per day but it has been dying down to mainly the weekends. I use a vibrator and it is not actually a vibrator but a small hand-held massager for the back. I use it on my clitoris and use my fingers for stimulation. I started around 9 years of age but then I had a two year period where I stopped completely, but started again around 12 years and have continued from that. When I was 9 years, I broke my hymen I believe, but only when I was 12 years, I started fingering myself. I use two fingers and actually, I have been bleeding from then. It happens even when I am not on or near my period. My nails are not that sharp, but when I finger myself, I bleed most of the time. The bleeding is very light. Just yesterday I started using a dildo and I was fine. I make sure my things are clean before and after I use them. But today after pumping myself with the dildo I felt a weird liquid flow out of me. I know it was not an orgasm because it did not feel like one. But when it flowed out it was like blood. I have no idea of what is going on. Am I making myself infertile? Does my vagina have some sort of disease? Do I have any health risks from this act?","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Masturbation does not generally hold a great risk but it does cause some complications. Frequent masturbation causes addiction. The mild bleeding you experience with the use of the vibrator could be due to local injury to the vaginal mucosa following a stimulating contact. This is alarming as time and again doing this could convert it to a chronic injury and cause ulcers, sores, andinfection. The dildo you are newly using can also lead to similar problems. I suggest you use them very occasionally or not use them at all. Keep the vaginal area always dry. Each and everytime you pass urine, wash and dry the area with a soft towel. Use Lactacyd feminine intimate wash to clean your private parts."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My foreskin has some cracks and sometimes blood also come. If I stretch foreskin back, it is painful.

No sensitivity to cold or hot. I went to the dentist and he took X-rays and compared them to routine X-rays taken a couple of months prior. He said the two sets were the same and saw no reason for the pain. He tested my bite with that blue paper and thought the issue might be related to my bite. So, he filed down one of my teeth ever so slightly and thought that would do the trick. Two weeks later, the pain had not subsided, I went back and this time he performed a CT scan. He thought maybe there was a crack or something that was not picked up by the X-ray. The scan was also normal, and he could find no reason for the pain.

As per your history, there is no pulp cavity exposure or even if there is a crack that will not cause the pain. The reason I think is the filling, which may be high (high point). The second reason may be a periodontal problem. I do not think RCT (root canal treatment) is the best possible cause. If you would have any sort of sensitivity, root canal could have been the option.

I wake up almost every morning having a panic attack, and I do not want to leave my bed, but I have to function.","Doctor":"Hello. Anxiety disorder and related panic attacks are best managed by a combination of medication and psychological therapy like CBT. Prozac (Fluoxetine) is effective not only against depression but also helps with anxiety. Discuss with your doctor whether you are on the optimal dose. Klonopin (Clonazepam) is indicated only for short term management of stress. If used for a more extended period, Klonopin may lose effectiveness and cause dependence.  So discuss with your doctor whether it is recommended to continue Klonopin in this situation. In addition to medication, CBT is very effective against anxiety. If you had already done a course of CBT, consider having some booster sessions. Try deep breathing techniques and progressive relaxation exercises for 15 to 20 mins daily. It will help you to relax and manage stress better."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a lump in my groin, which I pushed, and it popped.

Similarly, the penis has a slight black color. Itching and rashes on the umbilical side. Hair loss can be overwhelming.","Doctor":"Hello. The itching and discoloration on your scrotum and penis may be due to fungal infection. But it could also be due to another condition called scrotal dermatitis. The first and most important thing is to wear undergarments that are loose to allow air circulations. Keep the area dry always. Do not use too much soap or other antiseptics. Use Candid solution at night time and let it dry. You can use the Candid solution in the umbilical area also. Take a single dose of Fluconazole 150 mg tablet. If your symptoms show no improvement in two weeks, we can consider other treatment options. I would recommend you to upload photos of rashes in your genital area and umbilical area protecting your privacy, which will help me to get a more clear picture. Regarding hair loss, I would like to know your family history of male pattern baldness. You can use Mintop (Minoxidil 5 %) solution every day.

All other report blood report, X-ray, PFT, kidney, liver, ultrasound, reports are normal. Though I suffer from high triglycerides (200 to 300) since last five years, and before I took the echo test, I did TMT (treadmill test) 30 to 45 minute before, can it be as cause for mild PAH? How can I lower triglycerides, is there any medication which I can take for some time.","Doctor":"Hello. I guess you do not have any respiratory symptoms like cough, shortness of breath, etc. Mild PAH (pulmonary arterial hypertension) is unlikely to be related to exercise during TMT, as 30 to 45 minutes is enough time for the body to recover. However, since echo is an observer-dependent investigation, I would advise getting it repeated from DM cardiologist, if not done by one. I guess you do not smoke, which may cause similar changes. If repeat echo confirms PAH, then you ll need evaluation for the same. The assessment included a VQ scan (ventilation-perfusion scan), HRCT (high-resolution computed tomography) chest for the cause of PAH. Regarding triglycerides, besides a healthy lifestyle like avoiding oily, fatty, high-calorie diet, and regular exercises, you should have tablet Fenofibrate 145 mg once a day bedtime for six to eight weeks.

I fixed an appointment with an ENT yesterday, but surprisingly he told that she does not have any issues with her ear, nose, and throat. It might be a cold symptom. The cause of the pain could not be identified. Has it got something to do with any nerve syndromes as the doctor asked her to consult a neurologist or to perform a CT scan?","Doctor":"Hello. Your friend has been taking Franxit (Amitriptyline, Chlordiazepoxide) for how long? Any anti-depressant medication should not be abruptly stopped, and all somatic symptoms and even fatigue, headache, and nervous instability could be related to sudden withdrawal also. Moreover, taking into consideration of outer ear pain, otitis external must be ruled out. Does she have glue in the ear? Does she feel fullness inside the ear? Neurological problems related to the ear could be due to facial nerve insult due to virus -HZV (Ramsay Hunt syndrome) and there would be blisters in the ear which is less likely in her. Other than the above, I do not think any other neurological cause for the pain you mentioned. Does she complain of any face deviation? If not, no need to panic. Sudden anti-depressant stopping. Facial palsy to rule out. Post antidepressant withdrawal. Resume Franxit and withdraw slowly for a period of six to eight weeks.

Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis. Is it a wrong way of doing? I do not get excited during sex and unable to ejaculate. Only, rubbing the tip of the penis gives me excitement. Also, two weeks ago, I have undergone circumcision as my foreskin did not retract. Before circumcision too, I have the same problem. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. For further doubts consult a sexologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 30-year-old male. My lab results suggest, 1. Normal CBC, ESR, kidney function, and liver functions. 2. Normal CT scan on the brain. 3. I am not diabetic and do not have blood pressure or heart disease. 4. I am negative for all the virus A, B, C and HIV gen 1,2 and 3. 5. Elevated CRP level is 8. 6. My health condition is IBS, anxiety, tension headaches, allergic rhinitis, and poor dental care. I have an elevated CRP level, and I do not know why? And also how can my ESR be normal while my CRP is not?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to the icliniq.com. The CRP (C-reactive protein) raised in case of any inflammation in the body. ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) doesn't need to be always increased when CRP raised because ESR is a non-specific marker of inflammation. It is not as much sense as like that of CRP. Your CRP value mildly increased which will fall within range once inflammation resolution occurs. Allergic rhinitis probably might be the cause. The irritable bowel syndrome and tension headache are associated with anxiety. So you need to treat anxiety with anxiolytic medicine and with SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) group of drug for few months along with counseling. For anxiety treatment, you can visit a nearby psychiatrist. I hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I just started birth control a few weeks ago, so this is my first week of my period. I had brown discharge a few days before I started the sugar pill. My period started kind of light but is kind of thicker blood. I just had horrible cramps this afternoon, probably the worst ever. I took a nap and when I got up there was a large clot that looked like some sort of tissue. It was slightly smaller than an egg and was pink with dark spots. I am sexually active but my partner always wears a condom and has never finished inside me so there is no possibility of a pregnancy. Is this something I should be concerned about?","Doctor":"Hi. According to your description, the possibilities are: During the first months of Contraceptive pills, you can have some amount of menstrual irregularity like intermenstrual spotting. It may take a few months for regularization of the flow. And missing the time or pill can lead to spots. Regarding the tissue you mentioned could be endometrial tissue with blood spots. Anyhow better to check with a urine pregnancy test to be on the safe side. If the test gives a negative result, you can continue with your pills."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 34-year-old, and I have two kids one is three years and second is one year I recently tested positive for pregnancy, and I want to abort it.

I want to abort it safely with medicine. No previous issues regarding pregnancy or periods.","Doctor":"Hello. It is not recommended to take tablets without confirming the intrauterine pregnancy and ruling out an ectopic pregnancy. So, please consult your nearby gynecologist and undergo an ultrasound. After confirming the intrauterine pregnancy and gestational age, with your doctor's advice, you can plan for the termination of pregnancy. Up to eight weeks of pregnancy, medical termination with tablets is possible. I hope I have answered your query, and I will be happy to answer any further follow-up queries."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Lately, I have been aroused and sexually attracted to my fiance in my head, but when we start to fool around, I feel like I do not want him to touch me. Like he is a family member and not my fiance. We have also only fooled around maybe 10 times in the past year. We have been together for two years.","Doctor":"Hi. Your query shows that you are experiencing mixed kind of emotions and need some help. The reported problem is different than the one you are going through. There is more to it which needs attention. The relationship is yes, a problem at present. That may be because of what you had been dealing with. It happens when we struggle with something, it takes time to come back in a normal routine.  Also, you need to discuss openly with your partner if you have any questions in your mind about his life. Without them being cleared, your mind would be preoccupied."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 44 years old. I have Bartholin's cyst for the past eight months. It is small but painful daily and has a very tiny pinprick hole on hymen that seeps a translucent non-offensive discharge after I bathe or massage the lump. The lump is deep under labia major pea-sized. According to MRI, it is 10×8×4 mm. Will a gynecologist operate on it being so small and do a biopsy due to my age?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your description, the details you mentioned definitely suggest there must be some infection in the Bartholin's gland. As you have mentioned it has been painful for eight months, I would like to know if you took any course of antibiotics to address the infection. In your case, you can try that as the cyst is still very small. Although the definitive treatment for a Bartholin's abscess is excision and marsupialization of the cyst, for mild cases a course of antibiotics may provide some relief for some time. But there can be a recurrence of infection in such cases in the future. If the lesion is persistent or it increases in size, excision of the same is recommended. And it is usually a very minor procedure and not that painful too. So please do follow up with your gynecologist in case you face any such issues. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have done a FET transfer cycle before ten 10 days. My hCG pregnancy test is tomorrow. Are nine days too early to test? My other real concern is that on the day of transfer, my estrogen levels were 223, and progesterone was >40.0. Before four days my estrogen levels were 106 and progesterone was 35. I am still currently supplementing both estrogen (Estrace by mouth twice a day) and progesterone (PIO 1 ml IM once a day, and Endometrin suppositories twice daily). Does the drop in both hormones indicate that implantation did not take place? I find it unusual for both levels to drop simultaneously, especially while supplementing.","Doctor":"Hello. Usually, the levels of estrogen and progesterone will increase from early pregnancy to the third trimester. But often there will be some range of the hormones according to the gestational age. Though the levels of hormones little decreased in your case, they are still in the normal range according to the gestational age. Like during four to five weeks, the progesterone levels should be 11.2 to 90 ng/ml. And estrogen levels should be 100 to 400 pg/ml. So, according to this, your levels are still within normal limits so better to follow the course advice to your gynecologist and undergo hCG test as advised. I hope I have answered your query, and I will be happy to answer any further follow-up queries. Blood test for hCG as advised."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Suddenly, I had an intense stomach pain. As per recommendation, I had a CT scan and other tests were carried out. It reported small multiple calculi with biliary sludge in the gallbladder. Jaundice is also high. My stomach pain, headache, body pain and vomiting is happening regularly. I have all these for the last 20 days. Please suggest me what to do. As per my doctor I should not go for surgery till jaundice is completely nil.","Doctor":"Hello. I had gone through all the details posted. The problem you are suffering from is called acute calculous cholecystitis, where gallbladder has stones and gets inflamed along with hepatitis. As the stones are multiple, you may also suffer from pancreatitis, which should be checked by doing serum lipase level. So, in acute calculous cholecystitis when a patient presents early, surgery can be done for removal of gallbladder within three to five days of starting of pain abdomen or it has to be performed four to six weeks after everything has subsided unless there are any complications. Initially, we keep such patients nil per oral till vomiting and pain in the abdomen subside. Then, start on oral liquids and soft diet and keep on monitoring liver function tests. Kindly upload your liver function test and ultrasound official report for more information on this. You need to take antiemetics, antibiotics and hepatoprotective agents like Ursodeoxycholic acid. Avoid oil foods, non-vegetarian foods, take bland diet and follow up with liver function tests. Kindly get back with further details and upload all the concerned reports, so that I can go through them in detail and can help you further with your problem.

It started six days ago and he is getting better now but he used to take antidepressants like Escitalopram and Ezeepam and he has been taking these kinds of anxiety medicines from a long time but not continuously but from last six months the usage has increased. He is unable to sleep properly and he is getting restless. He is asking for that medicine but we think that it could be a reason for his sudden acute pancreatitis as alcohol and gallstones are ruled out. Please suggest what should we do.","Doctor":"Hi. I have reviewed your query and can understand your concerns. The patient cannot stop the medications at his own. It is always best to inform the treating physician before thinking of changing or stopping medications. There is a specific protocol to taper off Escitalopram. If stopped taking all of a sudden, patient may feel bad side effects. I would recommend consulting his prescribing psychiatrist for proper evaluation and management. There are other causes that may also be considered before Escitalopram. Parathyroid gland function testing and calcium levels in blood, smoking and other factors also need attention. Escitalopram is not so commonly documented cause of acute pancreatitis. The de-challenge test is done for drugs which are suspected as a cause of pancreatitis. But this is a very rare cause of pancreatitis. So, undue withdrawal can only complicate the situation. His physician can better explain him after having the benefit of physical examination and a detailed hand on access to his medical records."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I hope you are well and hopefully will be able to answer some of my concerns. For the past three months, I have been experiencing some unusual symptoms which have given me cause for concern. First of all, I am a 28-year-old female. Before three months, I started to experience a sort of internal vibration or shaking feeling all over my body. I still have this symptom today, there have been only a few days where it has disappeared completely. It also seems to get worse at night when trying to sleep. I have also developed random muscle twitching across my whole body; it comes on randomly and sporadically anywhere on my body. My final symptom which can vary on and off is muscle pain in all my limbs particularly my forearms and a sort of burning tingling sensation in my hands and feet. I have been searched online; it has given me the possibility of ALS. I am now absolutely terrified that I have this disease. My GP has done some muscle blood tests, and the only thing that showed up was a severe vitamin D sufficiency for which I am now on tablets. I do not think I have any muscle weakness, atrophy, etc. Do you think it could be a severe disorder or hopefully something treatable? I am a relatively healthy person I have diagnosed hypertension for which I take Ramipril. I am now taking prescribed vitamin D. Thanks for taking the time to read my concerns your opinion would be most appreciated. Many thanks","Doctor":"Hello. I passed carefully through your question and would explain that we can exclude ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), considering the fact that you have sensory complaints (tingling and burning sensation). From the other hand, this would be an exceptional diagnosis at this age. Also, vitamin D deficiency can mimic this clinical situation. Another possible cause to consider would be vitamin B12 deficiency or thyroid gland dysfunction. For this reason, I would recommend checking your thyroid hormone levels and vitamin B12 levels to investigate for a possible deficiency. As you are taking Lisinopril, I would recommend checking potassium plasma levels too as it can increase potassium plasma levels. Nerve conduction studies would help exclude ALS or peripheral neuropathy and put your mind to peace about ALS."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a doctor practicing in a rural area and aged 55 years.
