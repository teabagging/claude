I am a pediatrician and am glad to help.It is possible that by doing much coughing this is making her throat sore.  Although a temperature of 100.3 is not a high fever, Tylenol will not only reduce her fever, but it will also help to relieve throat pain.If she is doing her usual activities-walking, running, acts like she knows who you are, and is not vomiting or  dehydrated- then her illness is not severe.  But you must see that she doesn't become dehydrated.  Try giving your daughter Popsicles, Jello, yogurt mixed with a small portion of jam.  If she refuses to take any fluids, then try again in 15-20 minutes, It would be most unusual if your infant had Strep throat.  So I do not recommend she have a throat culture.  More than likely she has a viral upper respiratory infection which usually lasts 3-4 days.I hope that I have helped you.

I am a pediatrician and will be happy to help you.  The way you are describing your child tells me that he is working hard to breathe.  I agree with you he needs to be checked by a doctor tonight.  The physician will carefully examine him paying particular attention to his respiratory status.  The nurse will put a small device on his fingertip to measure the oxygen level in his blood.  The doctor will see if he uses extra effort to move air in and out of his chest.  He will see how fast son is breathing, whether the skin between his ribs caves in and whether his neck muscles bulge out when he breathes.  The doctor will use his/her stethoscope to listen over his lungs for sounds of wheezing and pneumonia.  Then order an X-ray of his chest to look for any abnormal findings.  If the doctor thinks your son appears dehydrated, the doctor may order IV fluids.  Please go as soon as possible.  I hope I have helped you and that his stay in the ER is a short one.  Come again if we can assist in the future.  Arnold Zedd, MD, FAAP"},{"Patient":"Hello, I am 18 YO female and i have been having pain in the lower right side of the abdomen.

I do not recommend stopping the Keppra until you speak with the doctor who is treating his seizures.In the meantime, try mixing the medicine with a small amount of his formula or cool, flattened soft drink.

In addition to an infection, other possibilities are obesity with poor hygiene, a foreign body, and an ectopic ureter (in which the ureter empties somewhere other than into the bladder). Ways of trying to find the cause include ultrasonography and vaginoscopy. If it is felt that your daughter needs to be put to sleep to investigate her recurrent discharge, the best and the safest physician to examine her is a pediatric gynecologist.This is a new subspeciality, so there are not many of such doctors available. The most likely place to find them would be at a children's hospital. Also, I recently read about the importance of having more than one staff person trained in pediatric resuscitation and anesthesia administration in the procedure room. You are more likely to find this in a children's hospital. Hope I have answered your query.

What has his intake been like today? Is he drinking? Any vomiting? Fever? Has he had any medicines? Acetaminophen will not irritate his stomach, but it will ease the pain.The paleness is a sign that blood under his skin has moved to the centeral part of his body. This happens frequently when children are sick. With illness, the frequency of bowel movements changes.Most stomach illnesses in children last for only a few days. I do not feel it is a good idea to give any other medicines because of side effects and the possibility that the expected course of a relatively minor sickness will be altered for the worse.Hope I have answered your query.

If the only sign of illness was the temperature fluctuation you describeD then I don't believe you need to take her to ER now.If you do not have a hand-held battery powered thermometer, then the best way to take a young child's temperature is rectally with glass bulb thermometer.After lubricating the bulb end with Vaseline ointment, spread buttocks and gently insert thermometer about an inch (2.5 cm) into rectum.

We started her on solids, rice cereal first, then rice cereal and peas, but we are wondering if we should stop the rice cereal, maybe barley or oat? also, if we do stay on rice cereal, we would like to make our own, we have some brown jasmine rice here, is that okay? if not, what kind should we use? Or should we stop cereal and just give her the veggies in the morning and night and cereal in the afternoon???

The location you describe is a common place to feel them. Normally, people have them all over inside their body. Usually, they are too small to feel. If there is a scratch, burn, or infection then the nearby lymph nodes will react and enlarge and can be felt.You may check her scalp to see if there is any scaling, red areas, or bumps with pus. If so, then that might explain the enlargements you feel. If your baby is otherwise healthy and you cannot feel any others, then probably nothing needs to be done now except to watch. Other parts of the body where lymph nodes are in front of neck, underarms, in the groin creases.If she develops fever, loses weight, or you feel more lymph nodes, then take her to the doctor right away. I suggest that you take pictures of them now so you can compare the pictures with how they look later on.Hope I have answered your query.

Was given a suppository and the Peaditrician       said due to the plug she may or may not have a slight case       of jaundice. If she does it will go away and we don’t have to walk       her in the sun.      10/11/2010-frst doctor s visit. She was examined and no signs of jaundice       was present. She did however have an umbilical hernia and a       small red dot on her back. The doctor said the dot was a birth      mark and both the hernia and birth mark would go away in time.      20/11/10-Wasiven formula was the first time       Prior to this she was only on breastmilk.      2/12/2010     -Scondoc visit for first vaccine shot. Examination showed she       had yellow in her right eye and the small dot had grown to a small      button size by now. On said day she was sent for a urine and       blood test. The results took three days and it showed that she       had a UTI. Her bilirubin level was 6.5. Her weight was 8.5 lbs My wife was also put on a diet of no cheese, milk products,       chocolates, high levles of protien for one week because the doctor       felt that Ari was a bit cranky and felt the mother s diet had       something to do with it.      8/12/2010     -Started a one week course of Augmentin for the UTI      17/12/10 -Returned to the doc, her weight was now 10lbs. She was sent for the same tests. Results came back after two days and her      bilirubin level was now 7. She was sent for an ultrasound of the liver and spleen. The mother s diet did show improvements in the behaviour of the child. 22/12/10-     First stool for the morning found green particle chunks in her stool. Did ultrasound at Westshore, results showed all organs to be normal. 24/12/10-     Found a green chunk in her stool again, normally her stool is cream in colour but this chunk was found within the stool. My question is what is going on with my child?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.The plugin her rectum that was present at birth represents dried meconium. The name of the substance that fills the baby's intestines while she is in the womb is called meconium. After the plug was removed, you might have seen that the subsequent meconium flowed out spontaneously and was moist. By the end of the first few days of life, the meconium clears the intestines. Then the residue of milk(breast /formula), cells that flake off from the intestinal lining, bacteria, and secretions from organs that empty into the intestines fill the intestines. This composition is carried along the intestinal tract and becomes the stool.Breastfed babies pass mushy stools, like cream soup that are light-yellow. Milk stools turn green or brown when exposed to air. Chunks are not worrisome representing undigested intestinal contents. When your infant is old enough to eat solid foods, you may notice undigested food particles in the stool.Jaundice in a baby who is nursing may be present for the first 1-2 months. The birthmark is most likely an infantile hemangioma which is very common and increases in size during the first few months of life.Regarding the UTI, I would be interested in learning how the specimen was obtained, what the urine culture result was, and what was the result of the urinalysis? Try not to be anxious. It appears that your infant is healthy and you have things under control.Hope I have answered your query.

Give 2-3oz of Pedialyte(where are you? I am in the USA and not aware of Gastrolyte. Is it the same as Pedialyte?)

When this occurs, sometimes the child can vomit. If the head injury is mild, then there may only be 1-2 episodes of vomiting. Other signs to watch for after a head injury: -a headache -dizziness -different sized pupils -stumbling gait Head injury does not cause diarrhea. I feel it is likely that he acquired gastroenteritis (most likely due to a virus) from another child at daycare.

This is a yeast infection in the mouth. Steroids and antibiotics make parts of the body susceptible to yeast infections. These white spots cannot be removed with gauze or a washcloth. To decrease the chance of her getting these spots have your daughter use water to rinse and gargle her mouth right after using the inhaler. Hope I have answered your query.

Thanks for your time.","Doctor":"Hello,How long has she had this? Is she otherwise healthy? The most common cause is an accumulation of dust, cotton fibers from clothes, dried perspiration, and dirt. Try wiping it out of her belly button using a moist cotton swab. Followed by a bath in tub paying particular attention to wipe out belly button with a wet washcloth. When it is all cleaned out, watch it frequently(every 2-3 hrs) to see whether any drainage reappears.

The child appears agitated and panicked and confused and dazed and may have his eyes open. At the beginning of the night terror, he can cry or scream. He may mumble, is often clumsy, and push a parent away. The child is unaware of what he is doing and has no memory of these events when he wakes up. He might become more upset if you attempt to calm him down. He may seem to be awake but is actually asleep. A night terror occurs within 1-2 hours after falling asleep. Duration: a few minutes to an hour.Night terrors often run in families. Can occur during naps, as well. Usually, require no treatment; however, if there is injury, violence, or serious disruption to family, then speak to his doctor. Another possibility to consider is night walking in which the child learns to need something(being rocked, fed, blanket) in order to fall asleep at bedtime. This same need can be present in order to fall back to sleep when waking during the night. When the child's needs are not readilyavailable during the night(being held, having a parent present) prolonged night walkings can occur. Here are a few tips to reduce night walkings:- Make the bedroom the same at bedtime as it is throughout the night(lights, music).- Put your son to bed drowsy but awake.- Check on him on a schedule according to his temperament and parents' tolerance for crying. The goal is for him to fall asleep independently.- Respond to the baby as usual(rocking, soothing) following nighttime awakenings. The self-soothing skills(falling asleep easily, quickly) that he develops at bedtime are likely to generalize to self-soothing during the night.Hope I have answered your query.

Been sick every hour through the night, now extremely tired, upset and dehydrated and wanting to drink lots of water. Shall I give it to him even if he can t keep it down, if not, is there anything else pls?","Doctor":"Hello,When an infant is doing much vomiting, he is not only losing water from his body but also essential salts. So water alone is not sufficient.I do not know where you are, but if your young boy is drinking tea, I would say you are either in Great Britain or in India. A standard of care in the USA for an infant losing fluid is a salt containing liquid like Pedialyte or Enfalyte.There are others, but these are the ones most commonly used in the USA. Do not attempt to make this at home. The manufacturers have mixed in the right salts in the right concentrations for the infant's body. These are available over the counter at a supermarket or pharmacy.If he continues to wet his diaper at usual frequency, makes tears when cries, has moist lips, tongue, and mouth then he is not severely dehydrated, and you can attempt to treat him at home. Start off slowly. Offer One ounce every 10 to 15 minutes.If no vomiting, after an hour, offer one and a half oz every 15 minutes. Still no vomiting, after the second hour, offers two OZ every 15 to 20 minutes. Then two and a half oz every 15 to 20 minutes. In the next hour, three OZ every 20 minutes. If he vomits during this period, you can refeed the Pedialyte.Following this, let him sleep. Giving more liquid when he wakens. By noontime, you can add Jello and Popsicles, continuing Pedialyte as he wishes. If he continues doing well and seems hungry, then, by late afternoon you can return him to his regular diet.Hope I have answered your query.

What to do?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.First, please make sure she doesn't have an illness that is more serious than a viral infection.Does she have skin rash? Is she alert, knows who you are and where she is? In supine position, ask her to lift her head and touch her chest with her chin. If there is no rash, she is alert, and can touch her chin then, it is unlikely she has a serious illness. Some physicians feel that a child's fever ought to be treated with only one fever medicine. This is because acetaminophen and ibuprofen are equally effective for fever. And acetaminophen is given every 4-6 hours while ibuprofen is every 6-8 hours so this leaves room for a potential mistake in dosing. Make certain you are giving the fever medicine as it says on label.She will feel better if she is not dehydrated, so remember to offer fluids (which can include Popsicles and Jello) frequently. I hope she is well in 2-3 days. If you have more concerns, please get back in touch.Regards,Arnold Zedd, MD, FAAP"},{"Patient":"my 7 yr old daughter is having stomach cramps, vomited a few times yesterday/ last night and is feeling sick today.

She is taking sips of water.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Has your daughter been in contact with anyone else who is ill? In an otherwise healthy child, what you describe headache, vomiting and abdominal pain is most likely due to a viral infection. There are many viruses circulating in the community now and it is probable that she caught one of them. If this is correct, she ought to be better in a few days.As for treatment, it is important that she is not given Aspirin. She may have acetaminophen or ibuprofen for headache. At this point, don't worry about her intake of solids, but concentrate on liquids. Offer her something to drink every 2-3 hours. When she is better and gets hungry, she will request something to eat.I hope she recovers soon. Please return if we can be of further help.RegardsDr. Arnold Zedd, MD, FAAP"},{"Patient":"Our 20 month old daughter has been complaining of back pain recently. When I ask her to show me where, she reaches back with her right hand, just above her waistline. A few weeks ago, she started screaming that her right knee hurt and she couldn t walk well on it for about 5 minutes. We noticed two unexplained small bruises, one on each side of her knee. Then this past week, we noticed a similar small bruise on her lower back. At this age, it s hard to know what is bothering her, but she really is very verbal for her age. She complains of back pain at various times - sometimes in her car seat, this morning when I came in to get her out of bed, other times just randomly throughout the day.

Some days the pains are not so bad but constant and other days the pain is so severe and I can't stand up straight and can hardly move. The pain gets worse with deep breathing, a lot of movement, being hungry, eating, some days I do nothing unusual and the pain gets super severe. I have had an upper abdominal Ultra Sound, An upper UGI with barium and they both came out normal. The doctor said those were to test my gallbladder but they did not find gallstones. They have not mentioned appendicitis. I am wondering what is causing the pain. Thanks","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query  to H.C.M. Forum. This is a very peculiar history. Nausea  , fatigue, loss of  appetite are due to PAIN. Now  the nature of pain . Pain threshold is  different in  different persons so at present keep it a side. As temperature goes down i.e. 94 F i.e. HYPOTHERMIA. Hypothermia obscures most of the symptoms and signs of INFECTION, notably fever and leukocytosis. Excessive ,extensive cultures and repeated physical examinations are essential. As I mentioned above Infection may obscures so we have too consider for abscess in Liver in initial phase, tuberculosis of intestine, Kidney functions ( MAIN EMPHASIS over this).

I take this opportunity to tell you certain scientific facts and relieve your distress –1. An active is a good kid even if she/ he is not eating well.2. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone.3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents, we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day.4. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding a good amount of ghee to it.5.

Yes, your pet could be a source of allergen but a child benefits in various other ways from hàving a pet. Regular follow up with your vet for your pet will help. Avoid dust mites with regular vacuuming and stay away from fleece n soft toys.An allergic patch test should be done to rule out food allergies and also know what are those to be avoided in actual. Steam inhalation twice daily with the use of normal saline nasal drops 3-4 times daily will relieve symptoms.You will have to see an ENT specialist for other medications like steroid nasal spray and any other if needed.

Respiratory symptoms are produced by viruses. However, fever may be the only sign of a viral illness.Some physicians feel that giving an infant two different medicines for fever is not any better than using just one. Tylenol dosing is every 4 to 6 hours; Motrin is given every 6 to 8 hours. It can be confusing when using both medicines.Luke warm water sponge baths can also be effective in reducing fever.When any infant has fever, it is important to see they are drinking enough fluids so as not to become dehydrated. A good sign that she is not dehydrated, is that she is wetting diapers with the same frequency as when she is well.If your daughter is taking fluids, is alert, allows you to comfort her, and not vomiting, then it should be safe to continue watching her condition for the next several days even with fever.

These medicines have to be continued for three years minimum and four to five months is still the settling time.

This simple and cheap procedure will improve her nose condition and will ease nose blockage by secretions.- If your infant is 3-6 months old, apply paracetamol, 10-15 mg/kg/dose every 4-6 hours. If your infant weight 10 kg, then you can give between 100-150 mg of paracetamol every 4-6 hours.- If your infant is more than 6 months old, paracetamol could be alternated with ibuprofen in order to dominate fever. Ibuprofen is given 4-10 mg/kg/dose every 6-8 hours. If your baby weights 10 kg, then you have to give between 40-100 mg of ibuprofen every 6-8 hours.- Keep your baby well hydrated and fed (liquid food).Please monitor your baby for another 2-3 days (usually viral infections last for 7-10 days) and if the condition does not improve, fever is not dominated or there are signs of laryngitis (dry cough, difficulty in breathing), severe and prolonged crying, difficulty to sleep, et cetera, then you have to consult your pediatrician for further care.Hope I have answered your query.

We just had a cat scan done because she was no better and now cat scan shows she has very large adenoids and sinustitis. Can adenoids grow back this fast in a 5 year old or could the doctor have forgot to remove them during surgery? The doctor was done with her surgery in about 10 to 15 minutes which I thought was resly fast.","Doctor":"Hello,My answer is as follows:There are only few studies addressing adenoids regrowth after adenoidectomy. The available information suggests that regrowth rate varies between 9% to 26%, but the regrowth usually is classified as \\"traces of adenoidal tissue\\" or \\"grade 1 - obstructing less than 33% of nasopharyngeal space\\".In this context, the conclusion is that adenoids rarely regrow and, when they do, usually their size is small or only traces, and asymptomatic. Please note that it is impossible to remove adenoids at 100% rate because this tissue is not encapsulated (contrary to tonsils); therefore, there is always the risk of adenoid regrowth.Literature suggests that adenoids regrowth after adenoidectomy is significantly higher among children aged 5 years or younger and those using antibiotics more often after surgery (implying frequent infections and inflammation, causing growth of adenoids). Also, the risk of adenoid regrowth is increased in children experiencing frequent infections of middle ear, gastric reflux. Also, the risk increases considerably if adenoidectomy is performed by an inexperienced surgeon (or surgeons that had just started to operate) compared to experienced surgeons.In the case of your child it is obvious that there is need of another evaluation and probably for a second surgery to remove the adenoid tissue again. You have not provided us with information about past ear infections and use of antibiotics for your child, but since your child is young and the procedure was performed rather quickly \\"10-15 minutes\\" then I judge that there is a high risk that adenoids have grown back and need to be re-treated.Hope I have answered your query.

How contagious is this and is there anything you recommend to further protect my classroom?","Doctor":"Hello,My answer is that you did a good thing to send the sick pupil home as the infection could have spread more easily with him around the classroom. However, influenza A virus is very contagious and it is very likely that you and your pupils have been exposed to it.In order to minimize the risk of infection, you and your pupils should frequently wash their hands and maintain a high level of personal hygiene (the virus could spread through contact of contaminate hands with eyes, mouth, nose, i.e. organs with mucous membranes).Since, the virus can spread via air (through small droplets) then it is important to detect all other pupils with flu signs and symptoms (fever, cough, runny nose, chills, tiredness, headache, cough, loss of appetite, et cetera) and to send them home for some days.Feeding well and keeping an optimal hydration level is also important. Pupils can take some vitamin C supplements (100-200 mg per day) for about one week as this strengthens their immune system.There is not much else than you can do in this situation. CDC recommends vaccination as the best option to be protected from flu, but this decision has to be taken in the context of the situation in your country, severeness of flu, et cetera.

Scientific tudies show that when clenil compositum (containing salbutamol) is given together with atem (containing ipratropium bromide), the results are better compared to clenil compositum alone.Therefore, you can give both preparations together, 2-4 times a day because they will not harm your baby but at the contrary, will help him.Also, you should find a solution for the chest infection, by changing the type of antibiotic for example, in close contact with your doctor, because it is a cause of your baby's cough.Hope I have answered your query.

The water was very dirty and when I pulled her out she almost immefiately threw up. We bathed her twice, she breastfed, and is now sleeping on my wife. Should we do anything else?","Doctor":"Hello,Short answer: Keep a close eye to your daughter but probably you do not need to worry.Detailed answer: You do not give information about the kind of sump your baby fell into. If we are talking about common home sump basins then I think that you do not need to worry. During those 3-5 seconds it is very unlikely that your daughter has swallowed or drank any of those liquids she fell into.If she swallowed some drops of that water (and we do not know what it contains) then her body will throw it out after passing through the gastrointestinal system and all you can do is wait and watch her closely to detect any unusual signs and symptoms indicating that something is wrong. Because the amounts of everything found in that water that your baby might have swallowed will be very small then this should not be a problem.If the sump belongs to a chemical factory or some other kinds of factories than the liquids could contain different chemicals and in this case you need to see a specialist if there are any unusual signs or symptoms, although again this is very improbable since your daughter was very shortly submerged.Hope I have answered your query.

He can be the most loving child and then do a 360 He never knew his father so couldn t act out from seeing him","Doctor":"Thank you for your concern.Generally kids show this stubbornness during toddler hood and may extend till 5-7 years of age. It fades away with counselling and other methods. You can divert his attention to anything else, when he is in better mood you can explain him what is right and what not. If you fulfill his demand every time then he will be more bossy. So just keep a balance what to fulfill and what not. Sometime just ignore him at that point of time and time out is also a good option. Gradually you can convert his stubbornness to determination for success.Only one issue is there that is his father's bipolar disorder which can be transmitted genetically.So I just advice you to show him once to a child psychologist for assessment.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"AndI have 1.2 year old child.

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days.

They said his white blood cell levels indicated a *possible* infection, but that has not been confirmed. At one point, his sugar level was below 50. With both of these factors, they moved him to NICU. My wife and I are a little distraught because I don t feel like he should be in there. We have his blood sugar above 60 with my wife s breast feeding finally coming in like it s supposed to. And all that he really gets in NICU that isn t anywhere else is the antibiotics they have him on, which they administer once daily. She has been discharged as of yesterday, but they are saying he could be in here another week, making our entire visit here 10+ days. My first priority is the well-being of my son, and I would do anything and everything necessary to make sure he is in the best health. However, this really feels like a way to just get more money out of our insurance. Also, while he was in NICU without us, he was fed formula (strictly against our wishes and demands) several times, was put on the antibiotic IV and has had at least 2 X-Rays (that I know of) before we were told anything. In other words, they do things first and inform us later. No doctor has talked to me about any of this, and I want to get to the bottom of what I should or should not be doing. I just wanted some medical advice before I move forward with the hard questions.","Doctor":"Hello,Newborn infection is quite common and that requires iv antibiotics and NICU admission which is done here. They are tiny so infection spreads very fast through blood and affects the lungs and intestine which is risky.To be sure about the status of these organs only x-ray is done which is perfect. And sometimes it becomes absolutely necessary and urgent so it is always not possible for the neonatologists to ask the parents before doing some intervention.Same is true for milk also, when mother's expressed breast milk is not enough (which is quite normal for early days of post childbirth) and baby needs extra milk there is no other option except formula. With the entire IV lines direct breast feeding is quite problematic at NICU. So, the baby's treatment is going in the right way I feel.Hope I have answered your query.

Increase the consumption of bananas and cucumber which are natural antacids. 2. Since the passage of stools is smooth you need not worry. Just take hot water fomentations for the perianal problem. That will relieve the symptoms. You can add half a sachet of magnesium sulphate powder to the tub of water in which you are going to sit for applying hot water fomentations. This remedy will give you instantaneous relief.

Does he need to see a doctor?","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in children. For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.For cold you can use Cetrizine at 0.25mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days.For nasal block, plain saline nasal drops will do, every 4-6th hourly to relive nasal congestion.If he develops severe repsiratory distress and fever not settling in 4-5 days and feeding difficulty - you need to seek medical attention please.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi!

The doctor first prescribed Azithral 200 suspension and then Advent Forte syrup. The fever has not subsided and she developed severe cough, which results in vomiting everytime she had food or medicine. Yesterday, the doctor diagnosed it as severe acute tonsillitis and added Zanocin syrup to the regimen. She also started passing greenish, mucus-like consistency stools everytime she urinates. For that, he added Junior Lanzol and Bifilac. Even then, she is having fever, but the intensity has decreased somewhat. The doctor told that only if the throat infection gets cured, the fever will subside completely. I am worried about adding the antibiotics up and up and is it safe to give all those medicines at a time? In addition, she takes Meftal-P suspension for fever also. Please give elaborate answer and advise what is the next step is to be taken?

She is taking Grilinctus for cough also.","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness.

I guess you have taken appropriate antibiotics for the uterine infection. Persistence of abdominal/ pelvic pain suggests a pelvic inflammatory infection.

An endometrial curettings and/ or biopsy may also be needed. Weight gain is unrelated to the infection. You need to check out your diet and take regular exercise for that. Thanks and take care.

I use saline nose drops, a vaporiser and a humidifier to help him be more comfortable through the night but still nothing helps. My mother-in-law suffers with her heart, has a very low to nothing of a immune system and has M.E. so I am also concerned that maybe her problems have been passed down to her grandson?","Doctor":"Hello! Welcome to HealthcareMagic! Have you taken you're child to a pediatrician? If no, better take expert opinion. Children may recover fast but can deteriorate too. As far as grandmother is concerned, has her physician told you she has contagious infection? Two months is quite a long period to treat the child on your own, as it may lead to many problems. Hope that clarifies your doubts. Regards, Dr. Ratna Mulay, Pediatrician"},{"Patient":"Hello our baby is now 1 year old. He is in fine health, eats solid food, has 6 teeth and plays in a whole day. But we have a problem when it is his sleeping time. He can not sleep without breast feeding. He needs in compulsorily. It is getting difficult now, as milk is getting reduced. Plus because of teething, he bites many a times. Wha is the solution on this? How can we make him sleep without breast feed? Is there any other way? If we don t feed him, he keeps on crying, without stopping. He feels drowsy, his eyes feel sleepy, but he does not sleep.","Doctor":"Hello! Welcome to HealthcareMagic! Most of the mom's face this problem. Best solution is to hand him over to his father to make him sleep or someone else. Be very firm and tell him that you can not feed him any more. That he is big enough. Don't think he doesn't understand. Kids are extremely intuitive and understand almost everything you say. Apply bitter gourd juice on nipples and keep putting some more if he persist suckling. I feel first method is best. He may cry for a few days, may through tantrums, but overlook it. Don't give in to his tantrums. Otherwise no one will be able to help you.

I was concerned since I was told to use only water-based lubricants so I bought him a Rite Aid water -based lubricating liquid. Was this the right thing to do? Is the hand lotion bad for him to use? My ex-husband and son s therapist are giving me grief about it. But my son was spending inordinate amounts of time in the bathroom and the hand lotion and shampoos were disappearing more quickly than normal.","Doctor":"Hello! Welcome to HealthcareMagic! Instead of imagining things first communicate with the child. Make it a regular habit to sit with him and share days things and others with him. Let him know how to keep his genitals clean and dry. Let him understand that it's ok to speak with you about anything. He is growing, so changes will occur and it seems you are alone to handle the situation. At this age they receive a lot, mostly crap from friends. To top it all, internet is there. Unless you try and keep communication open, he may not be willing to ask for help. Also he might be thinking this is men's thing and you are not aware of this. You have to be patient. Be around to help. Don't be too controlling or lenient.

I took her to the doctor who prescribed a mild antibiotic and 2.5ml of celestimine twice a day (that is now finished). It does not seem to have made any difference. Also once she has finally fallen asleep she wakes about 4 hours later screaming hysterically that her head and eyes are sore. Could she have sinus or allergies?","Doctor":"Hello! Welcome to HealthcareMagic! If the child is complaining she has a problem. Take her to an ENT for checking of inside of nose and ears. In the mean time you can give her plain steam, if she takes it.

Is there anything that it could be or that we could do?","Doctor":"Hello! Welcome to HealthcareMagic! As per your description the child has some intestinal infection. It doesn't need cat scan. If it's persisting then take him to a pediatrician, rather than landing in ER. Mostly such infections are self limiting.

Welcome to HealthcareMagic! This could be mild inflammation called phimosis. the part is very sensitive so may be very painful too. Better get a consultation by surgeon or pediatrician.

One should be concerned in such situations. The condition seems to be due to transient low immunity. But in this case, things have extended pretty long.

This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in air too. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced.

Do not put the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2.

He says he needs to poop, but nothing comes out. Sometimes a little liquid poop drips into the toilet, but he hasn t been able to do a proper poop for nearly two days. Normally, he has somewhat loose stools. He hasn t been long-term constipated, but is this serious? How can we get the poop out? He won t even let us look at his bottom, let alone wipe off the stains from the liquid poop, so you can imagine a suppository or any intervention that involves touching his bottom is not going to be tolerated. He s very traumatized as it is. I also know that this was probably caused by a poor diet lately. He used to eat a lot of fruit and fiber, but lately he is refusing to eat almost anything and we have succumbed to giving him highly processed foods (the stuff he WILL eat) so that he doesn t go hungry. I realize that the way forward is to rectify his diet (which we are already onto), but how can we dislodge the current blockage, if that is what it is?

He does one big wee and then the rest are a struggle. He said it is annoying. Nothing hurts.","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for asking on healthcaremagic. Seems like all is well. Might be that psychologically the child feels that he should not wet the bed at night and pass as much urine before sleeping as possible. It is more in the mind than the body i guess. Try to talk to him, maybe he has some anxiety. On the other hand you can get blood sugar tested, to rule out type 1 diabetes. However it seems all is ok. Hope i answered your query.

Yellow fever vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine. It means that it contains a weakened form of the virus. However it is not possible to get yellow fever from vaccine. Fever might occur as an immune response to the antigens in the vaccine. These antigens are proteins of the virus and they are responsible for immunity development. Remember vaccination is not a medicine or an antibiotic but a trigger to generate your own immunity against the disease. So fever can occur after most vaccinations. However it is generally not prolonged. You can give paracetamol drops to your baby. If fever is prolonged then you should consult your doctor to rule out another infection. Hope i answered your query, thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi. i have been suffering from recurring stomach pains and bloating. Doctor attributed cause to acidity.

(Have tried many different) this one works the best. But she has troubles pooping she screams on and off for hours throughout the day and night. The doctor told us to add extra water twice a day but i wanna second opinion","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for asking on healthcaremagic. A baby six week old might pass stools several times a day or maybe once every 2-3 days. This is the normal way. However if the consistency of stool is unusually hard it might suggest constipation. Babies at this age might find passing stool as a stressful event and hence the crying. You might try colicaid drops or any other simethicone drops. Giving gripe water like Bonnison from Himalaya might work well. All in all kindly make sure you are not adding less water and more formula to her bottles. Ratio should be correct. In the end, a colicky baby might have colic for a few months and its normally seen in many babies, it generally passes out when they start crawling. They find it easier to pass gas while they start turning and crawling. Some drops with amylase enzyme alongwith simethicone also work best for some babies. Hope i helped you out.

My son does not complain of any pain and is a healthy spunky 5 year old boy, he does need some dental work done just waiting to get in to see dentist so i just wondered could this maybe have somthing to do with these swollen lymphnodes or just any answers from you at all, thank you","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for asking on Healthcaremagic. I am a pathologist and deal with swollen lymph nodes in my patients daily. From your description it seems that the lymph nodes are small less than 1cm and soft and mobile. Usually most common causes are reactive lymphadenitis. In this case any infection in the area of drainage of the lymph nodes will lead to antigen being trapped in the nodes causing an immune response leading to enlargement. Usually it is not of any concern and subsides on its own. Causes could be as simple as dental caries, tonsillitis or pharyngitis, ear infections etc. Sometimes cause of reactive lymphadenitis is not found. Other causes could be a serious chest infection which is ruled out by x Ray in your case. Other rare causes could be a lymphoma or cancer in which lymph nodes are larger and harder in size and not mobile. All these diagnoses can be easily made with a fine needle aspiration cytology test in which a pathologist inserts a needle into the swelling and obtains few cells to be stained and seen under a microscope. However children might find the procedure scary and a bit painful and representative material might not come in small swellings in children. So I suggest you to wait for some time and if it doesn't resolve or grows in size then do a fine needle procedure. Thanks."},{"Patient":"My 2 1/2 month old son has a cough, low fever, lost his voice, is congested but no runny nose. Just a mucusy clogged sounding cough and tears when he coughs.

They usually occur form 6 months to 6 years of age and usually are self limiting after 6 years of age. They usually do not leave any focal neurological deficits also. Rather than the height of the temperature the rapidity of rise of temperature is more important.In general, antiepileptic therapy, continuous or intermittent, is not recommended for children with 1 or more simple febrile seizures. Parents should be counseled about the relative risks of recurrence of febrile seizures and recurrence of epilepsy, educated on how to handle a seizure acutely, and given emotional support.If the seizure lasts for longer than 5 min, buccal or intranasal midazolam (Available as Midacip Nasal spray) may be used and is often preferred by parents.If the parents are very anxious concerning their child’s seizures, intermittent oral diazepam (0.33 mg/kg every 8 hr during fever) or intermittent rectal diazepam (0.5 mg/kg administered as a rectal suppository every 8 hr), can be given during febrile illnesses. Such therapies help reduce, but do not eliminate, the risks of recurrence of febrile seizures.Regards – Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My 10 year old son is suffering from vomit sensation and high fever and very severe headache from last two days.

He stools 3 or 2 times a day but too loose or even watery some times. after giving antibiotics suggested by doctor stools come greenish and a bit strong but still not enough. can i give him SPORLAC powder? if yes then what should be the doses? Thanks in advance","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. What your kid is having is not diarrhea and it is only a gastro-colic reflux. It is quite common in babies of this age group to pass small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhea and especially antibiotics are not indicated.THIS IS NOT INFECTIVE DIARRHEA. IT IS VERY COMMON FOR BREASTFED BABIES OF THIS AGE TO PASS MOTION LIKE THIS. PLEASE STOP ANTIBIOTICS AND ALL MEDICINES. THE BABY WILL NOT REQUIRE PROBIOTICS ALSO.When the baby takes milk, the stomach expands. Then when it is contracting it sets off a wave form which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum, a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out. This is the basis for gastro-colic reflex. Do not worry unless the kid is having low urine output, is very dull or excessively sleepy, or having blood in motion or green bilious vomiting. You need not worry. Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish your kid good health.Regards,Dr. Sumanth MBBS, DCH, DNB (Paed)."},{"Patient":"Hello. My 2 year old has had a recurring fever that sometimes isn t treatable with ibuprofen or Tylenol, and has been vomiting several times throughout the day. He had the same issue about a week ago, but it went away within a few days and his Pedi said it was just a tummy bug, and to just let it pass. This time is a little different because one of his cheeks is bright red and hot to the touch. I m worried this could be something more, possibly? Should I just let this pass as his Pedi recommended last week or is this something worthy of making an appointment for? Thank You.","Doctor":"Hi... your pediatrician was right. I too feel that this is a passing viral illness. Recurrent viral illness is very common in this age group and season. I will explain you how are viral illness behaves so that you can be more confident.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi, My 9 year old daughter has a very loose tooth. When we went to take it out, she states it s very painful.

She has been on one for about two weeks and it makes her go but she is still complaining. Could it be a food allergy?","Doctor":"Hi.... I understand your concern. I do not think that this is food allergy.Your pediatrician was right. The most common cause is constipation, which you have already treated.The other two most important causes could be mesenteric adenitis, which could be because of non specific reasons like innocuous viral infections and the other possibility is a kidney all gallbladder stone (if there is a family history this becomes all the more important).These two if suspected, may warrant an ultrasound abdomen examination.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my baby born with red mark on the foot,after 1 month that mark became like blister,skin drop off and was liking a lot,after we gave him cream and antibiotics the situation didn t change. now on top of that grow small ball full of fluid?what we need do? and what is it? sorry for my grammar i m not english thank you","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.

Any reason why I have these problem and what can be done to correct it.","Doctor":"hi there, your history is a little vague but what I understand is that you have stomach pain due to parasitic infection and it is not relieved by taking medication. First of all you should know the type of parasitic infection and accordingly take medication for it. If it is worm infestation in the stomach which can also give rise to pain then you could try deworming yourself with antihelmenthics like tab Zentel one in the night and then repeat it again after 15 days and see if it gives you any relief. As for the butt pain well you need to get and move around every two hrs if you are sittling for a long time in fromt of the computer. also some form of exercise would increase the blood circulation and stop these symptoms.

She has nut and egg allergies and I feared allergic reaction, but now I m wondering if this is an ear infection?","Doctor":"Hi.... what you are quoating is called toxic urticaria. Sometimes any simple viral illness can cause this sort of allergic reaction in the body along with high fever. I suggest you continue giving Paracetamol or Ibuprofen for fever. If the Rash or allergic reaction is persisting even after few hours, I suggest you to give Hydroxyzine. But this is a prescription drug and you will require a doctor's prescription for it.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my daughter of 14 years of age has had wart like lumps on her legs for the last 2 and a half years, did appear to be getting better but now has similar rash on both elbows and knees. she also has 2 coldsaws on the corners of her mouth which she has never had before. can you hellp please","Doctor":"Hi... by what you say I feel that she is having viral warts.

Do you have a history of lifting any kind of heavy weight in the past, following which you developed this pain ? Do you work a lot on computer and you bend your neck down to look at your computer due to the faulty position of the level of computer ? In the first case, it could be a major muscle spasm, which will gradually go away with lillte bit of physiotherapy and anti inflammatory drugs with muscle relaxant for some time. In the second case, you must try to improvise on your posture and take breaks inbetween your work on computer and do some stretching exercises. You have to also see a orthopaedic surgeron to exclude cervical spondylitis. In both the above noted cases, improvement will follow with drugs and physiotherapy along with optimising your posture during all your activities.

I have a question concerning ventrilomegaly/hydrocephalus. At my 20 week ultrasound, it was determined that my daughter s lateral ventricles were enlarged to 10.4 mm (borderline/mild ventrilomegaly). We had a fetal MRI 3 weeks later, which determined she had no detectable brain damage. 10.4 mm was the highest her ventricles ever measured and within a month or two they were back to normal, around 7 mm, and remained that way until the end of my pregnancy. I always thought she should have been checked after birth, but doctors disagreed, saying she seemed fine . At birth, her head measured 13.4 in (around 30th percentile I think). Her head now, at 9 months, is 19 in (above 97th). Her fontalel is still open, but not bulging. Her eyes are not downcast. She does not vomit. But I have noticed several things for MONTHS, that doctors are unwilling to take seriously. She pulls at her right ear constantly. Her jaw pops. Her left side seems to develop more quickly than her right (it does seem to eventually catch up). When she walks (holding onto my fingers) her right foot is pointed outward and seems to drag a little. The muscle tone on her right leg seems stiff as well. She does crawl (started 2-3 weeks ago), but rarely rolls. She has drooled excessively since she was four months old (around the same time I noticed ear pulling/jaw popping). Doctors keep saying this is probably related to teething, but alas...still no teeth. The veins on either side of her forehead near temples are apparent, even though her skin is quite dark (I am white, her father is Zimbabwean). The only physical milestone she has hit on time was sitting (5.5 months) but she still topples backwards occasionally. Oh, and her forehead bulges slightly. It protrudes out further than her nose/cheeks. And no, the back of her head is not flat from lying on it. Perfectly round. So, should we be concerned? Are these symptoms worrisome, or am I being paranoid? Can ventrilomegaly work itself out in utero, but swell again after birth? Oh, forgot to mention she is normally a VERY happy go lucky baby. She has been irritable and crying almost constantly unless I m holding her for 2 weeks.","Doctor":"Hi... I understand your concern. You are an absolutely good mother and that to a very observant mother. You are not paranoid at all. If I was your pediatrician I would have definitely evaluated your baby.Your baby definitely needs neurological evaluation. All the signs which are pointing are definite indicators of neurological evaluation.I suggest you get in touch with a paediatric Neurologist as soon as possible.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my child has Greig Cephalopolysyndactyly Syndrome.

As CT scan is performed when you lie down and not moving, the hernia can be invisible for this test. Hernia usually appears while standing and pushing on the abdomen and in such condition the test should be done (groin ultrasound). Your symptoms seem to be caused by hernia which has recurred. Especially if your pain gets more intense while coughing or lifting heavy objects. I suggest you to have groin ultrasound performed (even if CT were clear) and visit your doctor once again.

I feel that when there is such an intense pain as is making a toddler to crying continuously, I feel that she should be evaluated for - 1. renal colic or stones in the renal system2. second possibility is mesenteric adenitis which is also quite common but harmless condition3. third possibility is that it could be a worm infestation.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"HI doctor, I hope you are well?

We routinely deworm every six months. However last night the kids were both feverish. 39.1 - 39.7. Was this the Zentel causing the fever? And is this an indication that they might have had worms? thank you!!","Doctor":"Hi... I understand your concern. But Albendazole or Zentel is not at all related to the fever both your kids are having.The occurrence of fever after medication is not an indication that they have worm infestation.As both kids in the same household have fever I feel that this is a viral illness and both the kids will eventually come out of it in a couple of days.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi...my child is 1month old.and due to insufficient breast milk I m feeding dexolac..but there is no change in his weight and as soon as he drinks milk after burping he vomits ...as days passing he increased vomits..I m tensed with this vomits.sometimes he gets milk from his nose .is that common in infants.

I do not think the problem is with your your breast milk or any of the formula feeding. I feel that your child is having gastroesophageal reflux or regurgitation, which is very common in this age group. As he is not gaining weight properly he will definitely require evaluation and anti reflux therapy. I suggest you get in touch with your pediatrician regarding this.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"hello, my two grandsons (cousins, ages 9 and 6) have the same symptoms.

What could be going on w/her and waht tests should I ask for?","Doctor":"Hi... by what you say I feel that your kid is going through a cycle of recurrent viral illnesses.You need not subject her to unnecessary investigations if she is well in between the episodes.I will explain you how a viral illness behaves so that you can be more confident.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"hi something is wrong with my 4 year old son. he is pooping almost white. he had a stomach bug a few days ago but he isnt throwing up and doesnt have diarreah, he pooped green earlier this week but it went back to brown. now it is almost white and looks like playdough, which we dont have any so i know its not a joke. he is also complaining of sore legs and his belly is hurting. he doesnt have a fever. i really dont know whats wrong with him. pls help idk what to do","Doctor":"Hi....

Parents are very vigilant and careful, little one is very active.","Doctor":"Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCPD) is idiopathic avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis) of the capital epiphysis of the femoral head.etiology is unclear, but it is likely caused by an interruption of the blood supply to the capital femoral epiphysis. there may be an associated hypercoagulability state (factor V Leiden).LCPD commonly presents in patients 3 to 12 years of age, with a mean age of 7 years. It is four to five times more commin in boys. usually LCPD is a self limiting disease , followed through a pediatric orthopedist. treatment is basically for pain and restoration of the hip movement . containment is important in treatment . non surgical containment include casts and orthoses. whereas surgical containment is accomplished with osteotomies of the proximal femur and pelvis. e short-term prognosis is determined by the magnitude of the femoral head deformity a er healing has completed.

Is this is normal?","Doctor":"Hi..Thanks for the query..As per your complain it seems that your daughter is in the Teething age and gum pain and bleeding can be due to swollen and inflamed gums that are common during teething..However bleeding gums and bad breath can also be due to infection in gums in case if you are not maintaining a proper oral hygiene..I would suggest you to consult a Pedodontist and get evaluated and in case if it is due to teething then you can simply do cool compresses over the gums and apply numbing gel containing Lignocaine to relieve pain..Maintain a good oral hygiene and brush her teeth regularly..In case if it is due to gum infection then cleaning of teeth will help..Give her tylenol to reduce fever..Hope this helps..Regards."},{"Patient":"My son just turned 3, he keeps talking about his bum being sore thoughout the day for 2 or so days.

Is it still within normal range?","Doctor":"Hi.as per your concern , fever on and off for 6 days could point to various reasons, along with variation in the hemoglobin. if you could repeat a blood counts again considering this is the 6th day of fever , also have a look at the platelets if it's dropping than the previous value .If so then it's advisable to visit your nearest doctor .  Also get a chest X-ray done to rule out any lower respiratory tract infections associated with wheeze. For symptomatic treatment ,if vomiting persists , u could use an antiemetic and an antacid for the discomfort. Antipyretics like paracetamol is good enough for the fever .

Your doctor is probably right.I will explain you how the viral illness behaves so that you can be more confident.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days.

It is quite common for babies of this age group t pass small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds.

Thanks for asking on Healthcaremagic. Inhalers with salbutamol or levosalbutamol along with steroids are given to children experiencing allergic cough along with wheezing. It is a safe alternative to giving drugs orally because it produces local effect on the respiratory tract rather than systemic body effects by oral drugs. Mostly in 50% of cases a child with wheezing outgrows it with age and only 50% cases develop into asthma in adulthood. However you can talk to the doctor if you can taper it off by decreasing the dose slowly. In case of changing seasons or superadded flu you ll need to give it regularly. Use a spacer, rinse the mouth after using an inhaler to minimize systemic absorption. It is always better to take medicines rather than have a breathlessness attack. All in all talk to your doctor.

But with the above maneuver if the bleeding is not arrested withing 15 minutes I suggest you take her to the nearest emergency room or doctor.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"I have a 2 year old son with lumps on his penis. I am waiting for an appointment with the paediatric urologist but thought I would check it out on the internet first and saw this site. The first lump I noticed at christmas, it was about the size of a grain of rice, it is attached and does not move freely with the skin. I can t work out if it is below the level of his gland, or right at the base of it and I don t like to spend lots of time looking at it for obvious reasons! It is on the side of his penis and today I noticed 2 further lumps. Any advice would be greatly received.","Doctor":"Hi... I understand your concern. By what you say I feel that your son is having smegmoma. It is a very common condition due to accumulation of smegma and easily treatable by application of steroid cream. Regular cleaning of the prepuce area by pulling the prepuce back during bath will not let this recur.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my so is 8months old and has been running a fever of over 101 for four days now.Despite my efforts to alternate tylenol and motrin,the fever will go away for a few hours with the motrin and come right back.This happened a couple of weeks ago i took him to the doctor and they gave him antibiotics and it went away,i don t understand why he keeps getting these fevers that won t go away.","Doctor":"Hi...by what you say I feel that your son is having recurrent viral illness. I will explain you how a viral illness behaves so that you can be more confident.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day.If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness.Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days.

I realized it happened yesterday wo. Pain. I thought it was my menstrual.   I am under a heat pad and now questioning what in really going on. W a hx of bleeding cyst and a dx. of fibroids, I am a bit concerned.","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query.Read and understood our problems. The cause of right sided pain with blood on wiping paper can be Stone in the right ureter. This causes pain in the right side as well as causes blood to appear in the urine. This is not your menstrual bleeding , nor is it relate to the  bleeding cysts or fibroids. I would advise you the following:Ultrasonography and X-ray of the abdomen will confirm the diagnosis.Intravenous pyelography to confirm the functioning of the kidney.Consult Urologist for further managment which may be removal by Ureteroscopy or lithotripsy or open surgery. This also helps to rule out other causes like colitis, Ovarian cyst or appendicitis with UTI"},{"Patient":"Hello,  I am a thirty three year old male.  For the past three years I have had severe upper abdominal pain.  When the pain triggers, my throat feels like it is closing, I get pain in my arms' and my ears start to ring.  My stomach seems to swell during the pain.  It lasts from a few hours to days at a time.  I have been diagnosed with mild acid reflux.  I have had a echocardiogram and a nuclear stress test and both came back good.  Am I suffering some type of nerve problem?","Doctor":"Hi, As such acid reflux doesnt happen because of nerve damage, it happens because a the sphincter between your stomach and esophagus isnt functioning properly which is causing acid from your stomach to reach your esophagus. It is this which causes the burning and pain sensation that you have. I believe the reason your doctor ordered an echocardiogram was because he/she wanted to rule out any chances of the heart being involved. I am sure you're doctor has prescribed you with a proton pump inhibitor like omeprazole as well given you advice on other lifestyle changes that will help you. So rest assured, the the acid reflux is not because of any nerve problems. I hope this helped answer your question."},{"Patient":"Hi, my 10 year old daughter has been very low recently and has had minor ailments such as bad stomach, headaches, abscess in her mouth.

Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment.

Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.For cold you can use Cetrizine at 0.25mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days.For nasal block, plain saline nasal drops will do, every 4-6th hourly to relive nasal congestion.Regards - Dr. SumanthRegards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my 11 months old have had a wet cough for a month.

Any known cause?","Doctor":"Hi...what you are quoting is exactly called encopresis. This occurs when the kid has hard stools, almost similar to constipation. But what happens here is the liquid stools will seep out on the sides of the hard stools and leak out. But, the main treatment of this is relieving of constipation.Suggestions:1. Natural methods are the best to relieve constipation.2. Constipation is a risk factor for UTI3. Maximum milk consumption per day should not exceed 300-400ml4. Minimum 3-4 cups of fruits and vegetables to be consumed per day5.

He has had really bad diarrhea and has been throwing up. There is occasionally blood in his vomit and there is quite a bit of blood in his stools. He has had blood in his stools off and on for the past couple of months but it has never been this bad. He has really bad pain in his lower abdomen/upper pelvic region. It hurts for him to laugh, cough, or bend over. What could be wrong with him?","Doctor":"Hi and thanks for the query, I suggest he deserves a proper clinical evaluation. Blood in stool deserves, especially when chronic in elderly men deserves exclusion of a tumour of the colon. A colonoscopy and testing for occult blood in stool might be appropriate. Depending on whether its bright red or dark blood, we could have an idea of the source of the bleeding, whether upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding or lower tract infection. Stool examinations could help exclude to the possibility of amoebiasis. A proper clinical evaluation to exclude peptic ulcer disease, a fibroscopy could be useful. an abdominalultrasound could also be useful to evaluate the state of abdominal organs. I suggest you consult an internist or gastrointestinal for a proper clinical evaluation.

He moves his head left to right about 6 times then stops for a couple of seconds and starts again. He did that today maybe 4-6 times. He did stop moving when I put my hand on his head but when i take my hand off he starts again. Could this be a sign of seizure?","Doctor":"Hi..by what you say I do not think this is a seizure.

Why does a child become anemic and is this treatment normal?","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for asking on healthcaremagic. Childhood is a continuous growing phase. During these phases we need increased nutrients. However these days, children are picky eaters who might not eat a well balanced diet. Hence it is important to give supplements. Anaemia is commonly seen in growing children. Anaemia can be due to iron, folate or vitamin B12 deficiency. It is important to see from a blood picture whether iron, folate or vitamin B12 ia to be given. In case hb does not increase even after such a therapy, then underlying causes like malabsorption, haemolysis, occult blood loss, aplasia or any minor thalassemia trait will be ruled out.

But as this is a single episode and the first episode I do not think that you should worry and start on antiepileptic drugs right away. But definitely your son will require evaluation. I suggest you consult your pediatrician regarding this.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hello my son is almost 3. He had ear pain and a cold, and now has perforated an eardrum. He also complained that his eyes were a little sore - they don t look it but he blinks a lot in the morning. Now there s a small rash which has appeared around the affected ear and under the eye next to it. Is this indicative of a eustachian issue? He is very happy and healthy otherwise.","Doctor":"Hi... I do not think that this is an eustachian tube catarrh. I feel that your son is having an acute otitis media or middle ear infection, along with some rash which is going on around his pinna.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment.If you are feeding her your breast milk - please do continue and do nto stop breast feeding.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi there.

The other possibility is a renal tubular disorder.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"i have a 5 yr girl she was fine before going to bed she got up an hour ago and her temp went from 101 to 104 in she was initially shivering and shaking but she has calm down now ... we gave her fever reducer when she was at 103 but has risen to 104 what should we do","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same dayIf the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all.Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My husband and I both had some sort of stomach bug (It probably is not Norwalk, as the one person who I came into contact with at work tested negative for it...I am a nurse).

It's the only real thing that has got me still feeling a bit \\"off.\\"  Is there anything I can do to reduce the gassy feeling after a stomach virus, or do I just need to let it run it's course?","Doctor":"Hi ! As both you and your husband have got gastro intestinal problems together, it seems that infection you got has a common source, most likely some food from outside which you both might have consumed. Possibly you have not taken any medicinal treatment for the same nor you have consulted any doctor till now. Once the infection persists in the stomach, it may give rise to all the symptoms you have mentioned about. I will advise you go for a stool test and if necessary , a culture sensitivity of your stool, consult your family physician, and take appropriate antibiotic covering both aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Amebiasis has to be specially thought of. You can also add some kind of probiotic with anti flatulant drug, and a proton pump inhibitor. Hope this will solve your problem. Wishing you an early recovery."},{"Patient":"My great niece (age 7) fell rolling skating Sat. and broke her left arm. They said it was the birth plate and I was wondering how dangerous that is?

She had no cold, nor was she sick, prior to the visit to remove the warts. Can her bronchitis be caused from an allergic reaction?","Doctor":"Hi.... by what you say this appears to be an allergic reaction to the treatment. Bronchitis can as well result in such scenario because, it is an inflammation and swelling up of the breathing tubes, which can I get occur due to allergic reaction or anaphylaxis.If the same drug or acid is used again the reaction may be very severe.

Ideal weight at the age of 1 yr of a child should be thrice of her birth weight. Though your daughter's weight is on the lower side, you need not worry if she is active, reaching her developmental milestones according to her age , wetting enough diapers per day.And when all the blood reports are normal, it is better to focus on her diet. Introduce weight gaining high calorie nutritious food on her diet.

If you are above 40 yrs of age, then I would like to know if there is any difficulty in your breathing or not. If so, then you should have a complete cordio-vascular check up by a cardologist. If the above is excluded, then most likely you are having hyperacidity, and possibly a peptic ulcer disease with posterior penetration. In this case you should adjust your dietary habits to more of roughage and less of fried and oily food. Also you should consider taking some kind of antacid, a probiotic and a proton pump inhibitor. In case you are not getting much relief, then you should consult a gastro enterologist who may suggest you to to for an ultrasound abdomen, or an endoscopic evaluation of your gastro intestinal tract.

Sorry to hear about your son.If he has wheezing, it is better to take him to ER or Paediatrician as further treatment can only be given after proper general physical examination and chest auscultation.

He always seems very uncomfortable and seems to strain a lot when passing wind or doing the toilet. We are currently using Colief in his bottles but it doesn t seem to be working. When he has dirty nappies there is small white blobs in it. They resemble curdled milk. Please can you advise.","Doctor":"Hi, First of all congratulations for your baby. I can understand your every concern related to your baby. Usually all infants produce lot of gas and strains, grunts, turns their face to red while passing stool and it is absolutely normal. Their stool texture will be continuously changing, so unless there is very hard pellets like stools or blood tinged stool, there is nothing to worry. I had the same experience with my baby. It is hard to see your new born baby turning red, crying , grunting, straining while passing stool but this will remain only few weeks. What has helped me during those days are - Giving tummy massage or exercise 3 -4 times/ day and while passing gas or stool, burping after every feed.Even Colicaid didn't work for my baby. Giving 2.5 ml of gripe water has helped sometimes. Don't worry, as far as your baby is gaining weight, passing urine and stool frequently. Continue exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months, that increases baby's immunity and also reduces the chance of constipation and diarrhea. Good luck."},{"Patient":"Hi, my 17.5 week old baby will not take a bottle. I exclusively breast feed. We have been trynig several times with the bottle and she refuses. She did take a couple ounces one time and since then will not. She may play with it in her mouth or else she just gets increasingly frustrated. We have tried myself giving it to her, my husband, we ve tried different bottles and nipples - nothing works. Do you have any suggestions? Also.... I have been told that some babies will go right from breast to sippy cup. Is there any harm in this and how old must she be before we try breast milk in a sippy cup? Is this harmful in any way? Someone told me ia baby doesn t ever use a bottle it can cause speech problems as the muscles of the mouth don t develop proply. Is this true? Thanks!","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for asking on healthcaremagic. It is recommended to exclusively breastfeed a baby uptil 6 months of age and then start weaning foods while continuing to breastfeed. The longer you breastfeed the better it is for the overall child development. Since the technique of feeding from breast and from a bottle is different for a baby, it finds it difficult to easily switch from one to another. Some babies totally refuse bottle if they have been exclusively breastfed before and there s no harm in that. The only thing is that mother finds it difficult to leave the baby with someone else for going to work or elsewhere. What is suggested is to try different nipples and someone other than mother to give the bottle. Since you have already tried all this it seems it wont work. You can start the sippy cup after 6 months along with semisolid foods with a spoon. There is no disadvantage of not using a bottle at all. In fact bottle can cause health problems like diarrhoea since the nipples might harbour bacteria if not cleaned and sterilised properly"},{"Patient":"my 13 year old daughter has a purple coloured lump( looks like an aereola) around and under her breast.she says it does not hurt.

We, being first time parent, are very worried - espceially with the fever that keeps coming and going for the last 6-7 days.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for asking on Healthcaremagic. 12-15 pus cells in urine are considered to be mildly elevated. Severe cases come with >100 pus cells/hpf too. Sometimes we report such a high number as 'too numerous to count'. The protocol says to give a urine cluture right away and start the antibiotic after that. Once the culture report is received 48-72 hours later, the antibiotic can be changed if need be.

So I had her lay with me and told her to take slow deep breaths as I asked her questions to try to dis tract her from worrying about her heart it slowly went back to normal. This is the second time she has came to me with this problem, but than last night she came to me with a new problem; her legs and feet were hurting, I was wondering know if she may have problems with her heart and blood not flowing well, she doesn t drink often but when she does she loves water. She does not drink pop. But one of the days that she had a rapid heart beat she was with her grandam s and she did drink pop so I assumed it was cause she flooded her system with sager and she was not used to it.","Doctor":"You can get her thyroid blood test done. Hyperthyroidism will lead to such palpitations and racing heart rates. On the other hand if it comes out normal you need to rule out any cardiac problem or any anxiety or panic attacks which might be causing it. Better to consult a physician"},{"Patient":"I have a small bump on lower stomach just in the crease between abdomen and pubic mound.

However what is more important is that the consistency of the stool should not be hard. Make sure that the ratio of formula and water is as mentioned in the directions. Too little water or too high formula powder will cause hard stools.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query. If I were your doctor, I would advise you for a routine/microscopic test of your urine sample followed by culture sensitivity to rule out a UTI, and also a gynae checkup to rule out a PID (pelvic inflammatory disease) especially if you are sexually active.I would also advise you for an ultrasound of the abdomen to rule our any renal calculi disease as suspected by you. The excess gas in your abdomen could be due to some indigestion which might not be related to the typhoid fever. Till then I would advise you for a proton pump inhibitor and a probiotic drug for some symptomatic relief. Further management would depend on the results of a clinical assessment and reports of the investigations.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery.

The spotting day is my estimated date of the period. It appears that the back pain may be due to ovulation, or urinary tract infection, or stone in the bladder.

I asked her if she felt like she swallowed and she said no it just went right down. she did not cough or gag and is still acting normal right now. i know im probably sounding like a crazy person but i still want to make sure there is no potential problem.","Doctor":"Hi.... as your daughter is not having any respiratory symptoms like coughing or choking or fast breathing or respiratory distress, you can be rest assured now, she would not require any emergency medical care. But these symptoms may start to occur even later when the foreign body in the airway is very small and when it gets lodged in the lower airways. If she has ingested it, no problem at all. It will come out tomorrow or it may get digested.Because a 5 year old kid cannot explain properly what has happened with hundred percent surety, I suggest that you take her to the nearest Emergency Room if she has any respiratory symptoms like cough, breathlessness, fast breathing or if she is agitated.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi, my son is 10 months old and is suffering from constipation.

Other than those symptoms and sleeping slightly more than usual, he has been acting normal - eating, drinking, going to the bathroom, and playing fine.","Doctor":"Hi... by what you say I feel that your kid is going through a viral illness. You need not worry about it. I will explain you how a viral illness behaves so that you can be more confident.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness.

An active is a well kid even if she/ he is not eating well.2. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone.3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day.4. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.5. I suggest you not to use appetite stimulants (like Practin or Cyproheptadine) on long run as they may cause drowsiness.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My son is 5.5 years , we already gave MMR vaccination dosages at the age of 9 months and at the age of 5 years (i.e. gave second dosage in the month of Dec 16).

Next diaper change I noticed that he had more red bumps and they were spread all over his groin and making their way up to his belly and tops of his legs/hips. Shortly after is when I discovered it s all over his neck, chest, back, his underarms and on his forehead. It looks like it s slowly spreading down his back to his buttocks. No fever, although his temp was 99 degrees earlier, but has been normal since. He s a little fussy and has green mucuous coming from his nose. He s had the green mucuous for the past two days.","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic. It could be any viral exanthematous illness.

The main problem is that he is constantly congested, often breathes through his mouth and is snoring during the night. However, he does not appear to have any other symptoms related to enlarged adenoids, such as sinus infections, sleep apnea or other infections. He is overall a healthy boy. The doctor, however, recommended that we remove his adenoids. We are a little skeptical about surgery because he is only 2 ½ and I read that surgery is safe after age 4. So, my question is, is surgery safe at age 2 ½, what are possible complications during and after surgery, will the problem of snoring and mouth breathing go away, and how can we alleviate the problem without surgery or at least until he is 4.

By what you say I feel that your child might be having moderate to severe persistent allergic rhinitis along with an upper airway resistance syndrome.Previously the only treatment for upper airway resistance syndrome used to be surgery or  adenotonsillectomy.But now advanced the modalities of treatment have come up, like intranasal steroids which can be given up to a period of 4 to 8 weeks and after which many kids are recovering without the need for surgery. This treatment will take care of the moderate to severe persistent allergic rhinitis also.But this technique of administration of intranasal steroids is very important and should be talk to you by your pediatrician properly.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"hi doc,i have a 7 years old daughter and she s having a cough for 10 days now i gave her solmux and tempra forte because she had a fever 2 days ago.we went to her pedia today and he gave meptin and klaricid and she took it around 2:30 pm after 3 hours she vomitted she said she don t like the taste of klaricid is it okay to take the 2 med at the same time?r just need to change the med?","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in children.I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO USE CLARITHROMYCIN AN ANTIBIOTIC.

She wont even touch her cup of milk. The only thing she eats without a fuss is oranges, which I let her have as much as she wants. I am really worried she will turn weak if this carries on.

As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play.

I understand your concern. By what you say this looks like a viral illness. But at the same time blotches for the skin associated with tummy pain and vomiting are suggestive of vasculitis or an allergic reaction which is going on along with the fever. If there is itching also then we should consider toxic urticaria due to a viral illness. I will suggest you the medications for fever which you can get over the counter. But the other medications used for itching are medicines which require prescription.For fever - Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.For itching and blotches on skin - Hydroxyzine at 1-2mg/kg/dose every 6th to 8th hourly for 3 days.But if the kid has got any other red flag signs like low urine output, lethargic even when there is no fever, I suggest you take her to the nearest Emergency Room.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Dear Sir, I need to consult the health problem of my 1 year child , he is wheezing badly... from last 4-5 days.

Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. All the precautions including birth control pills are not 100% fool proof in protection against a pregnancy. If I were your doctor, I would go for a serum HCG determination to rule this out in view of your tummy cramping and back pain with tender breasts before labeling it as a premenstrual symptoms. An ultrasound of the abdomen would also be helpful in ruling this out.Usually it is not normal for the periods to occur when you are on hormonal preparations.

You had sharp pain abdomen, you took ginger, and gasex, had burps,next day you had coffee, the other day you had stool softener, had bowel movement no relief.It increases after movement, like coughing , coughing, etc. relieves with pressure. The rule is when ever there is sharp pain one should immediately see the doctor, If you wait one day if no relief one should consult on the next day.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do. Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridges & soups.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My grandson age 6 had a severe headache.

For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.For cold you can use Cetrizine at 0.25mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days.For nasal block, plain saline nasal drops will do, every 4-6th hourly to relive nasal congestion.Hope my answer was helpful for you.
