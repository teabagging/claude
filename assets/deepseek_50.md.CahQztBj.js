There are however the following factors that go against that being a possibility in your case-1. you have been examined by a doctor- chest auscultation with stethoscope yields typical sounds heard in asthma, not heartburn.2. i assume, though details are missing in your query, that you may have been prescribed inhalers and tablets that help you. This is unlikely to be beneficial with heartburn.3. Other possible symptoms like breathlessness are typical to asthma, not really heartburn.Since the details are not conclusively mentioned in your query,I cannot inform the actual possibility to you. However, I have tried to make it simple and easy to understand so that you can draw your conclusions, or take a educated opinion with your regular physician.Tab Pantoprazole 40 mg once a day half hour before breakfast may help you  with your heartburn.Feel free to contact me for further suggestions if there is any point you need to clarify.Best wishes, Dr Mittal"},{"Patient":"I have asthma and am having some trouble breathing.

Avoid consuming the food that may be causing problems.2. Consult an Allergist for your treatment plan.The only management option for allergies is to avoid consumption of food that may be causing problems.There is hope for new treatment plans which includes consuming small amounts of food allergens and gradually increasing amount.

I do not like synthetic meds. and have become quite depressed as to what the mystery of the rash is. I feel a little despondent over the whole issue because I ve always had great looking skin. I am seeing a specialist on the 17th but the rash is in so many places it is really affecting LIFE. I have spent tooo much  trying to figure this out and I thought a Dr. would be able to help. I have lately been using a think layer of OTC Desitin baby rash paste w/zinc oxide to try and afford some comfort while at work. I am a African American woman who is 52 years of age w/a known allergy to penicillin.","Doctor":"HelloProbably contact allergy to something or food allergy should be excluded.

I was put on (Singulair) Montelukast Sod, 10mg by my physician about a week ago. I suffer from asthma and severe allergies. Live in Northern VA...allergens are rampant! Question: I have started to feel really nervous/edgy, kind of panicky and have nearly constant headaches. These are noted as common side effects of this drug. Is it OK to just discontinue this medication? Thank you","Doctor":"Montelukast is a relatively safe drug to use in allergy and astma.The side effects reported are headache (18%),gastric upset etc.Aggressive behavior,altered behavior reported are <1%.So the decision to continue/discontinue the drug depends on whether there is improvement of symptoms with tolerable side effects.If the side effects are more then better to discontinue and go for other alternatives."},{"Patient":"How long does it take to recover from a severe chronic reaction to Gold.

Just read on the internet that skin issues can occur. I take vitamin D (5,000 units in winter & less in summer) along with a SSRI to fight depression. Last summer I became very allergic to UV rays. Other skin issues are occurring. Last summer I had to stop using an anti-perspirant as it caused my underarms to itch. Also, many dryer sheets cause itching. I m 68 & my skin is thinning somewhat due to age, I suppose. Can Vitamin D be causing these skin problems?","Doctor":"hi sir/madam,Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.An allergic reaction to vitamin D causes the immune system to develop a defense against the supplement because of a hypersensitivity to the vitamin. The immune system reacts by creating Immunoglobulin E, or IgE antibodies, that attack the vitamin supplement, according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. Various other chemicals are released in the body, causing inflammation in the throat, lungs, sinuses and skin. The primary chemical that causes inflammation is histamine, a hormone that helps fight off infection.After ingesting a vitamin D supplement, hives can develop within minutes or up to two hours. Hives can occur because of too much histamine released in the skin. The rash appears as welts that appear in clusters anywhere on the body. The rash causes the skin to swell and has defined borders, although the rash can appear in any shape or size.Eczema is a chronic skin disorder where the skin is hypersensitive to various triggers, much like an allergy, according to MedlinePlus. If you experience an allergic reaction to vitamin D and you’re pre-disposed to eczema, the allergic reaction can cause an eczema flare-up. Eczema appears primarily behind the legs, arms and on the face in blisters. The rash can crack, weep and crust-over if scratched.Consult your GP for further treatments.hope this was helpful.have a healthy day."},{"Patient":"Seems like i cant get rid of this allergy, it is also affecting one of my ears, i have slowly been cleaning my ear out with my pinkie i was cleaning out my ears out with a wash cloth i have been taking claritin-D and apple cider vinegar.

It affects Rasa and Rakta Dhatu leading to manifestation of Pratishyaya. Wrong food combinations (Virudh aahar) having antagonist properties like fish with milk, fruit juice with milk, clarified butter with honey, ice cream after night meals, etc. leads to allergy.Ayurvedic line of treatment:-If the symptoms are severe and in chronic conditions, Vamana Panchakarma treatment, followed by Virechana is administered. This helps to relieve Ama and balance Tridosha.In some cases, where the patient has normal digestion strength, Nasya treatment (nasal drops therapy) is administered with herbal oils such as Anu taila or Shadbindu Taila.

Apple Cider Vinegar:-Raw and organic apple cider vinegar is another excellent home remedy to treat skin rashes and calm the itching. Moreover, its acetic acid content helps fight skin infections that could be causing or aggravating the problem.Dip a cotton ball in apple cider vinegar and place it on the affected area.Leave it on for a few minutes, and then remove the cotton ball.Do this several times a day for a few days or until your rash clears.Note: If apple cider vinegar causes irritation, try diluting it with water before applying it. If the irritation persists, then try another remedy.2.  Cold Compress:-A cold compress can be beneficial in reducing rashes, especially those caused by heat, insect bites, poison ivy and shingles. It helps ease itching, swelling and inflammation, and can be particularly useful if a rash begins to develop into blisters.Put ice cubes in a sealed plastic bag and place it on the affected area for a few minutes. Repeat a few times daily for a few days.Alternatively, you can simply soak a clean washcloth in ice-cold water and place it on the rash for about 10 minutes.(Do not put ice cubes directly on the skin)3. Aloe Vera:-Due to its anti-inflammatory, emollient, antibacterial and antifungal properties, aloe vera is excellent for treating a number of skin ailments including rashes. Apart from healing, it also soothes the skin, relieves itching and reduces redness.Extract fresh aloe vera gel from an aloe leaf.Apply it on the affected area.Leave it on for at least 20 minutes, and then rinse it off.Do this at least three times a day until the rash clears.4.  Oatmeal:-Oatmeal is great for alleviating skin irritation and inflammation due to its soothing and anti-inflammatory properties. It is excellent for rashes caused by poison ivy, eczema, sunburn, chicken pox and allergies.Grind oatmeal in a blender, food processor or coffee grinder. Mix one cup of finely ground oatmeal in warm bath water. Soak in it for at least 15 or 20 minutes. Do this daily until the rash is gone.Alternatively, combine one-half cup of oatmeal, one-quarter cup of milk powder and two teaspoons of honey. Put this mixture in a muslin cloth, tie it strongly with a string, ribbon or rubber band, and place it in a bath tub filled with warm water. Soak in the milky bath water for at least 15 minutes. Finally pat dry and moisturize your skin. Repeat daily for a few days.For rashes on your face, apply a thick paste of equal amounts of oatmeal and plain yogurt mixed with a little honey. Leave it on for about half an hour before washing it off. Do this daily until you see improvement.5.  Baking Soda:-Baking soda helps dry out skin rashes. Plus, it relieves the itching and inflammation associated with rashes.Add one part baking soda to three parts water. Apply the mixture on the affected area. Leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing it off. Do this once daily for a few days.You can also mix baking soda with some coconut oil to make a paste and apply it on your rash. Leave it on for about five minutes and then rinse it off. Repeat this once or twice daily until you see improvement.6. Olive Oil:-Extra-virgin olive oil works as a great skin moisturizer, facilitates healing and promotes skin renewal as it is rich in vitamin E and antioxidants. It will also soothe your skin and reduce itching.Simply rub extra-virgin olive oil or a combination of equal parts of olive oil and honey on your rash a few times daily until it heals completely.Alternatively, you can add a little turmeric powder to some olive oil and apply it two or three times a day for a few days. Packed with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, turmeric soothes rashes and relieves itching.In addition to olive oil, castor oil and coconut oil help heal rashes naturally. A combination of vitamin E oil and cod liver oil is another popular remedy.Hope i was helpful.Stay healthy,Stay safe."},{"Patient":"I just recently had a TB skin test.

However, a week later I got up to walk and felt almost paralyzed and unable to stand properly on legs. Finally went to the CVS to let them pharmacist know my systems and she gave me some benedryl and cortisone which soothed the pain; however, my question is, will this do because from reading about the fire ants they say if you are bitten by them seek medical treatment immediately, their venom has been in system for 7 whole days without treatment only day and night quil with ginger ale and orange juice.","Doctor":"hi sir/madam,Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.When bitten, there are certain Do’s and Don’ts. Follow these, and you will be free of any insect-ridden problems.DO’s:-1. When you are stung, on the arm or leg, the first thing to do would be to lower that part of the body in order to prevent spreading of the venom. Later, to reduce swelling, elevate that part of your body.2. Whenever your body moves, the venom spreads faster and so, it is advised that you stay seated or rest on your bed.3. If the area is getting bigger, swelling rapidly and becoming redder, it would be best if you went to a doctor immediately for medical attention.4. If the person has been stung in areas such as the mouth or throat, or the person appears to be going through an anaphylactic shock, visit a doctor as soon as possible.DON’Ts:-1. The most common reaction to a bite is to scratch that particular area. Well, the truth is, you shouldn’t. It only worsens the problem and increases the risk of infection.2. If you try to experiment with the area where you have been stung, such as rubbing or squeezing, things will only get worse.3. If blisters are formed, do not break them.Home Remedies:-Tackling this problem at home isn’t difficult and there are a number of home remedies that one can adopt to help tackle insect bites and stings.1. Remove the sting and wash it with water using some soap or antiseptic hand wash.2. Soak a cloth in cold water and apply on affected area and press gently.3. Baking Soda – apply it on the affected area and it will help neutralize the acidic nature of the sting. 4.Crush Tulasi leaves and apply the paste on the affected area.5. Turmeric and sandalwood – apply  half a teaspoon of each to the wound for healing and a soothing sensation.6. Neem –  mix neem powder with water to create neem paste and apply it at site of wound for 15 minutes.7. Banana – the inner part of a banana, i.e. The inner skin when rubbed on the site of bite, helps reduce swelling and irritation.8. Coriander – take 2-3 teaspoons of coriander juice and apply on site of the bite. To make the paste, add and crush coriander leaves and mix with one-third cup of water.Ayurvedic medicines used are:-1. Somraji Tail:- apply over the affected part.2. Nalpamaradi taila:-Local application.3. Gandhakadya malahara:-Local application.4. Shatadhouta ghrita:- Local application.5. Bilvadi gutika:-1-0-1 with water after food.6. Kaishora guggulu:- 1-0-1 with luke warm water after food.Hope i was helpful.Stay Healthy,Believe in Ayurveda."},{"Patient":"I am leaving for vacation to Hong Kong on Sunday and believe I have shingles.

Egg, dairy, peanut, tree nuts, fish and shellfish can be gradually introduced after less allergenic foods have been tolerated. In fact, delaying the introduction of these foods may increase your baby’s risk of developing allergies.• Reducing exposure to some allergens, such as dust mites, may delay or prevent allergy or asthma symptoms.• Exposure to tobacco smoke before and after birth increases your infant's risk of developing wheezing and asthma.Hope this info was helpful.stay healthy,stay safe."},{"Patient":"hello,i have been taking montelukast and clarithromycin form the past 2 weeks the doctor recommend too.i still have runny nose itchy nose..my past illness was Pneumonia my lung have been scar..doctors say here in Belize that i dont have cure.you think i could get better..this illness is driving me crazy","Doctor":"hi sir/madam,Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.As per Ayurveda, Allergic rhinitis is compared with Vata- Kaphaja pratishaya.

For years I have developed allergies. At first, I thought them to be normal allergies caused by seasonal pollen and whatnot.. just taking medications like Benadryl and nasal spray seemed to be helpful. However, It became an everyday thing. Everyday, as soon as I open my eyes, my sinus starts burning and I start sneezing. My nose constantly runs, which can be embarrassing in public. The not so normal part is I started developing sores inside my nose and they cause me pain and irritation which makes me sneeze even more frequently. Another symptom is a foul smelling odor that kind of smells like a wet dog. I have been dealing with this issue for years and I can t seem to find a proper medication that works and brings relief. Can anyone shed some light on this issue so I can treat it better? Thanks","Doctor":"hi sir/madam,Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.As per Ayurveda, Allergic rhinitis is compared with Vata- Kaphaja pratishaya.

It affects Rasa and Rakta Dhatu leading to manifestation of Pratishyaya. Wrong food combinations (Virudh aahar) having antagonist properties like fish with milk, fruit juice with milk, clarified butter with honey, ice cream after night meals, etc. leads to allergy.Ayurvedic line of treatment:-If the symptoms are severe and in chronic conditions, Vamana Panchakarma treatment, followed by Virechana is administered. This helps to relieve Ama and balance Tridosha.In some cases, where the patient has normal digestion strength, Nasya treatment (nasal drops therapy) is administered with herbal oils such as Anu taila or Shadbindu Taila.

Understood that your son is still having pain in abdomen in spite of treatment and Creatinine coming down from 4 to 1.6.This is a good sign of recovery in kidney disorder. Repeat ESR reading to see the prognosis, it is good if ESR is also reduced. Yes, the painkiller Majezic can cause deranged kidney functions.The cause of the pain in such a case can be due to the following reasons:Due to high creatinine in the blood the intestines may not be moving in the correct speed and causes partial paresis of the intestines causing stagnation. Since the body tries to push the contents forward, the spasms thereupon can cause the pains. Secondly, this all predispose the intestines to more intestinal infection which in turn can cause pain in abdomen.

It is true that tongue in its swelling conditions is taken as a kind of defence mechanism which helps in fighting against the infection and aids in healing. However, when there is an excessive swelling for longer time; the swollen tongue can be actually very much harmful.It must be mentioned that tongue inflammation or the swollen tongue condition can result from the excessive fluid accumulation in the tongue tissues and termed as Angioedema. This swollen tongue can also occur due to excess deposit of abnormal substances like the amyloid protein and also can be result from any kind of allergic reactions to certain medicines.Symptoms Of Swollen Tongue:-1. Enlarged, puffy tongue due to excessive swelling2. Difficulty breathing when tongue swelling outgrows to the throat or the air passage.3. Discoloration or redness seen sometimes due to inflammationProblem while swallowing foods.Causes of swollen tongue:-1. Tongue sores usually caused due to virus.2. Strep infections can cause swollen tongue.3. Sometimes burning of tongue while eating food in hot conditions can lead to the trauma and swollen tongue.4. Vitamin D deficiency can also lead to swollen tongue and other tongue inflammation.5.Certain allergic reactions can cause swelling in tongue.6. Patients suffering from genetic disorders like down's syndrome, are likely to have swollen tongue.7. Tongue cancer, leukaemia etc causes swollen tongue.8. Breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue or Rhabdomyolysis can cause swollen tongue.9. Hypothyroidism, amyloidosis etc can also lead to tongue swelling.10.Excessive alcoholism and smoking also causes swollen tongue.Next i am going to tell about the home remedies you should follow:-1. Take enough of butter, soups, yoghurt, gravy and broths in regular diet. In fact try to switch on the semi-solid foods which help in providing relaxation in swollen tongue condition.2. Cold temperature helps in reducing the tongue swelling. So keep some ice cubes in your mouth and relax yourself.3. Include celery sticks in diet and provide enough relief to your swollen tongue.4. Make a dilute solution of turmeric in a warm glass of water and gargle with the solution to get relief from tongue inflammation and swollen tongue.5. Drinking small amount of water at regular intervals help you ease the swelling of tongue.6. Placing a spoon of sugar on the tongue also help you in reducing the swelling of tongue.7. Soak some rosemary, mint and aniseeds in a bowl of water overnight, strain the mixture and use it as a mouthwash in the morning. This will help you greatly.8. It is also advised to take less amount of salt and prevent excessive production of saliva, which might cause difficulty swallowing with a swollen tongue.9.Aloe Vera as Herbal Home Remedy for Sore Tongue,because of the anti-inflammatory properties, Aloe vera is used as a herbal home remedy for sore tongue to reduce pain and inflammation. All you can do is extract the gel from an Aloe vera leaf and apply it directly over the affected area in the tongue. You can also rinse your mouth few times with the aloe vera juice for reducing the inflammation.10.Baking soda, due to its anti inflammatory property can be used as a natural home remedy for sore tongue. You need to make a paste by adding ½ tablespoon of baking soda to a glass of water and apply it in the affected portion of the tongue or the mouth.11.Honey is a wonderful home remedy for sore tongue. You can apply honey to the affected area in the mouth for better healing of the sores. Honey can also be added to lukewarm water for rinsing the mouth twice or thrice a day.Use any of this home remedies to get a excellent results.Hope i was helpful.Have a healthy day."},{"Patient":"Hi, my name is Upasana , age 25, and I am from Deloitte.

Answer: treatment of allergic rhinitis has mainly three aspects1. Avoiding allergens, irritants and triggers that give you symptoms. I know this is not easy but that’s how things work in this disease. These triggers can be indoor or outdoor. If you don’t know yet which allergens are causing your symptoms, then you should get tested for those ones so that you can avoid them. 2. You need to have medications such as antihistamines, decongestants and nasal corticosteroid sprays to control and treat your symptoms. There are different types of medications with different side effects. 3. When your symptoms are not controlled with the above-mentioned medications, then you have to consider immunotherapy. This will be decided mostly by your specialist doctor. People with nasal septum problems can also benefit from surgery. So, I would recommend that you see an immunologist or allergist as medications haven’t effectively worked in your case so that they can consider immunotherapy for you. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"a high eosinophil count......doesn t link with a chronic cough,according to all the cause and effect literature l ve read on a high count of these white blood cells.....my wife for a long time has a high count of Eosinophil and for many years has tried every process/procedure,medication to try and eradicate the debilitating cough she has been plagued with without success.......she had a stressed induced heart-attack after a severe bout of coughing .........there is little or no phlegm during these coughing spells.....anything spring to the fore ?......thanks for your time","Doctor":"I am sorry for the troubles that she is experiencing.  I don't want to just recommend an allergist, but a high eosinophil count is usually indicative of some uncontrolled allergy which can often be something in the home environment.  Fortunately today there are a number of treatments that can be directed towards the eosinophilia itself.  If you haven't done so already, I would also recommend getting anti-allergen pillow and mattress covers as well as a high efficiency air filter for the bedroom and living room."},{"Patient":"I have had a cold with severe congestion for over a week. The congestion worsened so that it felt like my ears were plugged. My sinuses were also very congested. I experienced severe dizziness and vomiting, had to go to the Emergency Room.

Could it just be fluid buildup in the inner ear causing my dizziness? They prescribed medication for nausea, valium and meclizine for the vertigo, prednisone for inflammation and a nasal spray for nasal congestion. Also recommended I use Theraflu to further loosen the congestion. What are your thoughts or ideas?","Doctor":"I agree that this could very well be due to a problem with your eustachian tubes in your ears caused by allergies.  Seasonal allergies can cause fluid build up in the ear which can lead to sensations of dizziness.  I agree with the medicines that have been given to you by the ED.  If you are still having trouble, a medicine like sudafed might help in drying out your ears."},{"Patient":"I have a friend who has been suffering with hives for aprx 6 months, and her eyes get real read and she just dont feel good when these hives come on.

The medications given to you for anaesthesia may have included an opiate as well so it is difficult to determine what would be to blame for your symptoms.  I would recommend stopping the oxycontin and see if tylenol and ibuprofen alone would keep your pain under good enough control. For future procedures, you could consider asking for a different pain medication for your recovery period that could include a different opiate to see if you can tolerate it without developing a rash."},{"Patient":"I have been prescribed to take ranitidine capsules.

I sometimes get a severe pain in my lower abdomen that seems to start on one side, and slowly move to the middle, and it lasts anywhere from a few minutes to 20 minutes. It is an excruciating sharp throbbing pain, and the only way I can ease it is by hurling over on the floor, in basically a fetal position. What is this called?","Doctor":"Hi,From history it seems that you might be having intestinal colic giving this problem.This can be due to constipation or some Gastro-intestinal infection.Take Meftal spas or Cyclopam as needed.Take light diet.Take plenty of water.Ok and take care."},{"Patient":"HOW MUCH IS IT ? -May not be able to get the answer--but this question might help some one else--and I THANK YOU MUCH if I can,t afford to pay and if there are no answers for me-. -I do have adult asthma of severe attacks- off in on. Pretty healthy most of the time other than headaches often.-----I keep Symbicort with me -close by most all the time.and only use it when necessary. Plus nebulizer.with Albuterol with but the last Dr visit with my lung Dr was upsetting. I was having a very hard time breathing at the time.-Just gasping for air.-- The Dr. listen to my chest and back with a stethoscope and told me my lungs were getting better -come back in six months. That was it. Have not been back even through its been over six months but still having attacks now and then. Sometimes I get chocked easy -start coughing and have a bad asthma attack. Some days are really rough-, in trying to breath normal . I don,t smoke-nor drink and never have but was around second -hand smoke a lot and worked in a air polluted place. What would you suggest --not easy to find a new Dr. but wondering if I Should.---Thank you for any suggestions. One lady at church says it,s all in my head -breath deep and I will be fine. So wrong she is, but I just let it go and wish I could breath normal.","Doctor":"The symptoms you describe indicate that your asthma is not controlled very well. I would recommend taking your Symbicort inhaler every day (twice a day) even on days that you feel well. Symbicort works mainly as a preventive medication, to prevent you from experiencing the troubling symptoms you describe. I would advise that you take it regularly even when you feel fine. If after doing this you are still experiencing poor asthma control, you should see a doctor to help you determine what your next best step up should be.Hope you feel better."},{"Patient":"Hi Doc I have been taking Sulfamethoxazole 1 two times a day and today I am broke out in whelps my question is what can I do dry these whelps up also yesterday and today my blood pressure has been low one time yesterday it was 76/51 today 100/50 I had THR on the 8/21/2017","Doctor":"Hello. I am glad you contacted me for your problem. Sulfamethoxazole is a Sulphur containing drug. People can be allergic to drugs containing Sulphur. The symptoms of wheals that you mentioned do fall into the category of an allergic reaction which most probably are due to the drug intake, if they did start after starting the drug. The thing that I am more concerned about are not the wheals but the low blood pressure that you have been having lately. This symptom shows that you might have or are going towards a major allergic reaction. The first thing I would like you to do is to STOP taking sulphamethoxazole immediately and if you have access to an over the counter anti-allergic like Benadryl, then take a dose of the anti-allergic medicine as early as possible. Take lots of water to keep yourself hydrated and flush the drug out of your body and get medical help by going to the closest emergency room or doctor. If your symptoms do improve by stopping the drug then you will need to remember the drug and do inform doctors about this event when next time you ever get prescribed any medication. I wish you the best and hope that you recover soon."},{"Patient":"Hi I ve been caught with the flu and asthma for the past week but got worser in the past 4 days iv got a persistent cough runny nose watery eyes and sneezing aswel and just wondering what can I do because I need to get better for my kids the 3 of them are sick as well","Doctor":"Hello. Glad that you asked about you condition. As you know flu is a viral infection and does not have a specific treatment that can be offered. Some doctors can give anti viral drugs but they are usually reserved for extremely sick patients requiring emergency or hospital admission. Flu is usually a self limiting disease and should start getting better in a few days. What you can get treated for is your asthma. Keeping your asthma at bay would definitely make the flu symptoms better as well. I would recommend you to take your regular asthma medication exactly as you have been advised.If you are on no treatment then you need to see your doctor or preferably a pulmonologist who can start you on the medications. He will most probably start you on an anti-allergic initially along with a single or a dual inhaler depending on how bad your asthma is, after listening to your chest. He might also give you an antibiotic if he finds or suspects an infection in your chest. Your treatment might also include a short course of steroids if he thinks you need immediate relief from asthma symptoms. So as you can see there are a lot of options as to what can be done. All these options necessitate that you need to be examined to assess how bad your asthma is. Apart from the medical treatment, what you can do at home is to keep yourself warm, keep the home ventilated to keep the air fresh, have hot drinks like tea, green tea, soups and occasional coffee. Most important of all keep yourself well hydrated as not to get dehydrated because that will make you feel weaker. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi Santosh, My name is Rahul, I am 27 years old.

Starting affect my daily routines, work, and external activities. Any suggestions please. Tony","Doctor":"Allergic rhinitis is not a rare disease and can effect a people of differernt ages. All the symptoms that you are having are more or less classical for this condition. There are three major ways to go about in treating Allergic Rhinitis1. Prevention - Taking medications to avoid having the symptoms2. Symptomatic - Taking medication to alleviate the symptoms you are experiencing.3. Immunotherapy - Make you immune to the allergens causing the symptoms in the first place.In your case as your symptoms have already started. We need to get your symptoms in control first. You are unfortunately having the full package of symptoms i.e., your eyes, your nose and your chest, all three things are involved. If your symptoms have failed to settle with an anti allergic medication like telfast and are experiencing fatigue and lack of sleep then its better you see your physician sooner than later. I would suggest that you should be on the following drugs initially and then the drugs can be slowly tapered off.1. Steroid nasal spray2. Anti allergic eye drops3. Anti Allergic oral medication4. A Steroid + Beta Agonist inhaler (If the chest on examination reveals narrowing of airways)5. In extreme types of allergic Rhinitis your physician can even give you a few days of oral steroids to get your symptoms under control quickly.Once your symptoms are under control then he can concentrate on referring you to an allergy specialist for immunotherapy which can take weeks to months to get the adequate relief required. Till then your drugs will help keep your symptoms at bay and help you go about your daily work with little or no problems.

The allergy is caused due to altered immune response that over reacts to normal allergen. Consulting dermatologist would help to find out the type of allergen and treatment usually involves medication or de-sensitization.  The above measures will help.

He is 74 and had a test that showed out of 47 test sites he tested positive on 36 which was grasses, trees etc.  My question is, what side effects are there from these drops. We were given no paperwork with them other than instructions on how to take. he has been extremely tired.","Doctor":"Hi i do care for your concern. The allergy drops are given as a de-sensitization procedure to treat allergy. The mechanism of the drug involves inducing our immune system to react with the allergens. The tiredness is due to increased workload on immune system of our body. It is advisable to have healthy diet, proper hydration and multi vitamins to reduce the tiredness and increase well being.

The red rashes may be caused due to sun exposure or even trivial exposure to allergens, and to some extent caused by the rug that you are taking.

This has been going on for over two weeks and now I'm developing hives, which I can control by taking Benedryl.  It doesn't appear to be subsiding.  Is there something else I should be taking?","Doctor":"Hello Thanks for posting here. Your symptoms like runny nose, sore throat, cough, hives all point out that you may have allergic rhinitis. The upper airways i.e. your nose, throat are reacting unusually to some substance which can be present in the air, in your surroundings. Usually most common allergens are smoke, dust, pollen, pet hairs and some food products also etc. So get your house vaccuum cleaned, stay away from pets and gardens. It can also be worsened due to climatic conditions. There are blood allergen tests and skin prick allergen tests which can determine what are you allergic to, so that you can take necessary precautions. For your symptoms you can take tablet montelukast FX 10MG once in the night for about 14 days. This tablet is a combination of montelukast and fexofenadine which will definitely take care of your hives, runny nose and other symptoms. Also do a spirometry which shows functional capacity of the lungs. Allergies can also involve the lower airways causing asthma. It is a test in which you are required to blow into a machine to test your lungs functional capacity. If spirometry shows reversible obstruction then you must be started on inhalers also.

After 10 years of allergy shots every two weeks and 20 years of taking various medications such as: numerous steroid nasal sprays (as much as three times a day), Guaifenesin (twice every day), Cetirizine or Loratadine (once every day) and five nasal polyp surgeries. Now, imagine me without all these medications and shots 30 years ago what my life was like with uncontrollable sinus drainage. In 1975 I was given service- connected disabilities for triad asthma (allergic asthma, nasal polyps, allergic to aspirin), chronic sinusitis, and allergic rhinitis plus dysgeusia and anosmia associated to allergic rhinitis. Last year I was seen for sinus drainage on my vocal chords. Here is briefly what some medical records state that I can provide for you if you would prefer to see in lieu of this; 1978 paranasal sinuses are well pneumotized. There is complete opacification of right maxillary sinus. There is almost complete opacification of the left maxillary sinus. The frontal sinuses are somewhat hypoplastic. The ethmoid air cells and sphenoid sinuses are clouded, 1979 chronic nasal airway obstruction and nasal polyps, 1980 the grossly polypoid and infected mucous in the sinus… and it was found grossly thickened mucosa, 1981 sinusitis severe will need repeat surgery… sinus pain, 1982 mucosal thickening noted in the left maxillary sinus. Frontal sinus is opacified bilaterally as in the sphenoid sinus and ethmoid sinus. Imp: pansinusitis with more opacification in both the left and right maxillary sinus than on 4/8/82 however again sinusitis is still present, 1983 rhinitis/sinusitis is severe…unchanged over previous visits, 1984 triad asthma with nasal stuffiness…nasal redness… post nasal drip…sinusitis severe today…severe and persistent rhinitis/sinusitis…chronic sinusitis secondary to his intranasal polyp disease. He presents now with recurrent intranasal polyps, bilateral nasal obstruction…a CT scan was performed which confirmed this density, 1985 lateral wall of the sinus appeared to be somewhat eroded and roughened as evidence of expanding mucole…The area of the old nasoantral window was identified and appear to be fibrosed and did not allow adequate drainage…drainage constantly down NP and out both nostrils…no improvement since surgery…persistent drainage, congestion 1986 continues to have sinusitis…severe vasomotor rhinitis…Has taken a number of antihistamines. Having difficulty breathing through nose…Nasal mucosa swollen. Then the incident happened where I lost my hearing in the right ear with tinnitus. There are two scenarios why I lost my hearing and if you would offer your professional advice to which one most likely happened, I would absolutely appreciate it. Scenario 1: Knowing all the facts above, the incident was as follows (1986); I was sitting at home on the PC with severe nasal drainage, presumably from polyps, rhinitis and/or sinusitis blowing my nose hundreds of times per day into bath towels all day. The mucus was thick and sticky resisting coming out, much like what you called mine, like dental cement. Next thing I know, my children and wife are picking me up off the floor carrying me to the LRVA emergency room and stayed for three days. The physician in the ER told my wife that I had blown so hard that it ruptured my ear membrane. I did have my eyes darting back and forth very quickly causing me to vomit if I opened my eyes. When I left the VA, I immediately went back to work without ever having any complications other total hearing loss in the right ear with tinnitus. A VA hearing test several months later confirmed total hearing loss. Was hearing loss from blowing my nose too hard the result and was sinus drainage the reason? Scenario 2: Knowing the facts above, a neurology physician the third day in the VA saw me and said it was probably vertigo with Labyrinthitis. This was 1986 so he is no longer available to question to see if he had any idea of my decades of sinus problems and the VA hospital charts those days showed normal temperature. The eyes stopped darting and no vomiting after the first day, nor any prior viruses or colds. How likely did this scenario cause the hearing loss, knowing I was blowing my nose severely before the incident? Is Labyrinthitis the cause or the result of the cause (trauma from blowing the nose and rupturing the ear membrane) causing the hearing loss? (1) Which scenario would you in your professional opinion believe is most likely to have happened, knowing all the facts preceding the incident and with the facts you know presently? (2) Reviewing the medical records summarized (1975-1986), the service-connected disabilities, and the observations you have made present day, how likely did the severe sinus drainage with thickened, sticky mucus cause the blowing of the nose that caused the ear membrane to rupture causing hearing loss? Larry Beshears","Doctor":"sce.1 : Definitely you might have ruptured your ear drum as of nasal blockage there is one way that blown air can go to Eustachian tube and by pressure build up you might have ruptured it. it may associated with secondary infection which has spread from nose to middle ear.sce.2: can't read it properly"},{"Patient":"I am highly allergic to macrobid and also Bactrim.

Thanks, Kim","Doctor":"Greetings! Stomach pain at night is a symptom that may be specific for certain diseases but typically other clinical features will be evident. It can also be due to a host of causes that causes pain irrespective of the time of day. The first consideration when evaluating stomach pain at night is whether a meal was consumed recently, if yes your pain can be just due to gastritis! Another common association with stomach pain that is more common at night is lying down, whether on the back (supine) or face down (prone). These changes from the upright position may also be a more likely factor for eliciting or aggravating pain associated with certain postures. i would suggest you have a quick walk after you finish your dinner , which helps in digestion and may solve your abdominal pain!"},{"Patient":"I was given levaquin for an infection where i had stitches in my hand.

Small fibers generated during paper production are mixed into the atmosphere, which can then lodge in the lung tissue resulting in inflammation and obstruction to air. This gives rise to symptoms like cold, dry cough, intermittent fever. A definitive diagnosis can be made after some tests like X ray chest, CT scan that will show typical changes of this disease.

But Asthma is mostly associated with cough, breathlessness, wheezing sound while breathing in, mucus production, chest tightness.Some times Anxiety can result in inability to take deep breaths but as you are not having other symptoms like sweating, fast heart rate and the fact that your symptoms are since 4 weeks, we can safely rule out anxiety as a probable causePneumonia can be another differential diagnosis, but we can safely rule that out as there is no fever or chest pain.Other causes like obesity, heart attack are also ruled out from your history.But to make a definite diagnosis I would still suggest a visit to a Pulmonary specialist.Hope you are satisfied with the answer.

Do you?","Doctor":"Hi ,you have been given medicine mainly for venous thrombosis and heart .They have given medicines for gastritis as well, famotidine.Some time cardiac problem will lead on stomach wall odema and that might be responsible for your lack of appetite.This problem should be taken care by the medicine you are already with.So don't worry .But if shortness of breath persists get investigated again."},{"Patient":"Hello.

I do have a bit of histamine reaction going on which means I cough up some phlegm and some sneezing. Is this just allergies?","Doctor":"Hello,        I just read your query. As you have persistent dry cough and sneezing etc. symptoms these all are indicating towards upper respiratory tract infection due to allergy. *Allergy can be due to many reasons like seasonal allergy, polyps in nose or deviated nasal septum etc. These are the most common causes behind allergy.*Start talking plain water steam two to three times a day. Steam is very helpful in dry cough. You can add one to two drops of eucalyptus oil in water too,if its available nearby you. Eucalyptus oil is also helpful in preventing cough.* Take one glass of lukewarm milk while sleeping with half teaspoon of turmeric added to it and a pinch of black pepper. As it will help in increasing your immunity and will also relieve the allergic symptoms.* For body aches you can take tablet paracetamol.* All these measures are preventive, but still go for an ENT check up as with clinical examination the doctor can rule out the exact cause and it would be helpful for you in future.* I hope you find my answer helpful.Thank you."},{"Patient":"My sister took cipro 500mg bid for 7 days for a UTI. She completed the medication about 2 days ago. She now has extensive bruising all over her lower rib cage and abdomen. They found the UTI when she was being diagnosed with positive flu. She did not take Tamiflu or other flu medication. Could the bruising be a side effect of cipro?","Doctor":"Hi, THANKS for asking question. I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. Bruising is not a side effect of ciprofloxacin. It can cause rash that is usually red,pink in color and it consists of blisters or papules.You should take your sister to your treating physician as bruising usually is due to thrombocytopenia (low platelets). So if this is the case he/she can look for alternate diagnosis. ThanksHope this answers your question.

There is nothing alarming, let me answer your questions one by one.1.Chronic bronchitis is when you have a cough with sputum production on most days of the month for 3 months of the year for 2 consecutive years. Your symptoms do not sound like chronic bronchitis.2. Yes, it does sound like a bacterial infection since your symptoms have lasted for about 6.5 weeks now. Green coloured sputum is seen in infections caused by a bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa and is usually acquired from hospitals.3.Since you have a sore throat, cough with sputum production for 6.5 weeks, it's likely that you have upper respiratory tract infection. 4. Your symptoms could also be due to Acute bronchitis. A visit to a General Physician would be sufficient in my opinion.

Can elevated Ferritin level of 677.9 in adult male be caused by the Iron Alloy? Is removal of the Implant the best course of action and how can we locate an OS who is willing to remove the implant? Hx: The patient is 53 year old male, who sustained an on the job injury to his left shoulder. Prior to the injury he was a healthy, robust individual, w/o physical ailment. He never smoked, drank alcohol, or engaged in drug use. Exercised regularly and participated in Martial Arts. He underwent a left shoulder arthroscopy (July 2012) for repair of partial rotator cuff tear. Within one month of the surgery his health begin to deteriorate. He is now unable to engage in ADL(bathing, dressing, and feeding) he is bed bound (except for trips to the various doctors), ambulates with a walker (ataxic gait) and assistance from family members, weight loss of more than 40 lbs. and severe headaches. His memory, speech, vision and coordination have been affected and he is now insulin dependent. He has undergone extensive medical testing. Nuerological dx: Encephalitis Cerebellitis with a finding of voltage gated potassium channel autoimmunity. Testing for autoimmune deseases and a variety of cancers have come back negative. Four rounds of IG intravenous treatments were given, but there was no improvement in his condition. Since his symptoms begin shortly after the shoulder surgery, his family begin to suspect a connection. Through research we found medical assistace and tested for heavy metals and other possible allergens. Results showed: Antimony, Lead, at elavated levels (above reference range), aluminum and nickel were also present, within ref. range, Gadolinium was extremely high (believed to be due to numerous contrasting MRIs that he has recieved) and Ferritin at nearly 3x the level that it should be. We know for sure that the implant and suture each consist of some combination of these metals. Chelation therapy was started (the end of Nov 2013), after the second treatment he begin to show some small signs of improvement. Now, headaches have stopped, coordination has improved- still ambulates with a walker, but he is steadier on his feet, he can shower and shave and feed himself again. We are cautiously optimistic that a nearly full recover maybe possible, if we can remove the source and continue to clean his system. We have asked the orthopaedic surgeon who performed the surgery about removal of the implant, but he maintains that such a reaction is not possible and he is refusing to remove. Besides the patient has lost confidence in this surgeon and has indicated that he wants another OS. Thank you for any help and advice that you can provide.","Doctor":"Hi!You wrote that everything has been one month after intervention that patient health begin to deteriorate and the doctors has diagnosed him for Encephalitis..Cerebelitis.Those are common complications that may be happened during or after a surgery intervent and in my opinion are the reasons of all the signsthat you prescrive after.So i belive that patient had pased a cerebral accident which need a lot of time to recover with medications..phisiotherapy..etc.Since immunologic and allergic test are negative that is no reason to connect the patient 's situation with a allergic reaction of implant.I think that full recovery will be possible after some times(depend of accident) but the reason of all is at cerebral acident and i connect with the orthopedic surgeon idea that implant haven't reasons to remove.My regards !"},{"Patient":"My wife has had constant problems with allergies or issues with dusty christmas decorations. She goes between having a stopped up nose or it is draining like a river. What over the counter meds should be considered? We have a humidifier in the room and run a air filter in the room where she is sitting/sleeping.","Doctor":"Hi,Looking at your wife's symptoms, she is probably suffering from Allergic rhinitis (Inflammation of nose due to Allergy). Common causes of allergic rhinitis include the allergens like fecal matter of the house dust-mite, animal proteins from domestic pets, and industrial dusts and fumes. It would be advisable to do Allergic test through which it would be possible to find out that which substances (Allergens) your wife is sensitive and causing symptoms.The management of allergic rhinitis consists mainly of (1) environmental control measures and allergen avoidance, (2) pharmacological management Environmental control measures and allergen avoidance involve both the avoidance of known allergens (substances to which your wife is found sensitive-which aggravates her symptoms) and avoidance of nonspecific, or irritant, triggers. For dust mites, covering the mattress and pillows with impermeable covers helps reduce exposure. Bed linens should be washed every 2 weeks in hot water to kill any mites present. Thorough and efficient vacuum cleaning of carpets and rugs can help. Dust mites thrive when indoor humidity is above 50%, so dehumidification, air conditioning, or both is helpful. Control measures for mold allergy focus on reduction of excessive humidity and removal of standing water. For animal allergy, complete avoidance is the best option.Exposure to smoke, strong perfumes and scents, fumes, rapid changes in temperature, and outdoor pollution can be nonspecific triggers in patients with allergic rhinitis. Consider avoidance of these situations or triggers if they seem to aggravate symptoms.She might find relief by taking following medicines:Steroid Nasal spray like Fluticasone propionate or Mometasone-helps against allergy and reduces inflammation, Oral Decongestant like Phenylephrine and Nasal decongestant drops like Xylometazoline - they help to decongest the nose and sinus cavity and helps in nasal blockage (if you are not suffering from Hypertension) Antihistaminic like Loratidine(Claritin) - helps against Allergy,Mucolytic - like Ambroxol - it will help in breaking to mucus secretions. Saline nasal spray-helps to moist the nasal cavity and removal of allergen particles from nose. Also do steam inhalation.Hope this answers your question.

Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system that attack antigens, such as bacteria, viruses, and allergens. High IgE levels in kids are associated mainly with allergic reactions (when the immune system overreacts to environmental antigens such as pollen or pet dander) and parasitic infections. A normal IgE level ranges from 0 to 380 international units per milliliter,In case of parasitic infection-your child might be having other symptoms like watery diarrhea,​ soft, greasy stools, tiredness, stomach cramps, bloating, and nausea. Children usually contract intestinal parasites when they come into contact with contaminated earth, water, feces or food. Doctors diagnose the infection by taking samples of blood, stool, urine and sending them to a laboratory for analysis. If parasitic infection is positive,then it may be treated with medicines like Mebendazole and Albendezole In case of Allergic reaction (mostly in airways).Your child might be suffering from other symptoms like running nose, cough, watering from eyes, and sneezing, You doctor has given you Myteka sachet which contains Montelukast which helps in allergic reaction.

I had one for 3 terrifying days, & the bizarre & unusual things that my body was doing were unbelievable. Since my family was away I video taped much of it on a poor quality camera. Luckily the camera (and a ruler for scale) were able to clearly show my hands swelling to more than double in size and vivid red dots appearing between each hand knuckle. (Feet, too). The skin on my body seemed to whirr from the inside out & cover my body with new skin. Even the remains of a 52 staple abdominal scar was covered and looked 20 years old instead of 4. My old broken wrist felt like part of me. The skin turned absolutely white when they swelled (x2) white like when a nurse uses latex to empty an arm of blood prior to surgery, only whiter). I had 72 hours of various bizarre involuntary small movements- tendons lengthening and bone realignment, with no more control than when a braindead woman (yuck, but I saw it) gives birth. At the end I was emotionally devastated but felt better than I had in 2 decades (I have had Lyme for 31 years)Now I know it was a H-H, something barely covered in my Med School Lectures ( Syphilis..blah..blah..blah, silver for the wealthy, antibiotics now, blah, Tuskeegee, blah, tasteless jokes, blah, blah, now let s get back to Infectious Disease and Real Medicine ). I couldn t diagnose myself but Curt Brown, MD did by phone in2 minutes. (Best doctor & human being I ever knew- killed by the Red Cross to save a few pennies on prescreening donated blood.) Gentle genius that he was, he immediately asked what antibiotic I had just started. How did he know? Because there was an epidemic of Lyme disease in Connecticut & he was invited to join the board looking into it.. It was 1986 and he was uninvited back for suggesting that Lyme would be the next big disease, that people s lives + brains would soon be infected and the the blood supply most certainly already a vector- he also recommended how infected women could give birth to healthy babies. Doxy, right? he guessed. The spirocete maybe in your CFS already and in your brain. The H-H is from its death and the contents spilling into your circulatory system You need it IV now, I ll help. Sadly for the world this fine Physician and Hospital Medical Director died very soon thereafter- he had received 4 units of blood (US Red Cross) tainted with Aids a few months earlier. Probably THE FASTEST exposure to death method there is- not a needle stick but LITERS of HIV virus poured into his veins- and his wife and children as lovely and trusting as him- litigation out of the question because no one could possibly play Russian roulette with people s lives. Meanwhile Europe had been testing donated blood for a year. But, I digress in my anger. I never finished school- never gave birth- I was too sick. 23 years later I am hanging IV s around the clock. Years of fights with insurance companies delayed that thanks to that shorthorned whore, Dr. Steele formerly of Yale. One of those who accepted utside money to sit on a many and minimize the threat of Lymes. He was BANNED from the second panel which could only include scientists, experts and those not receiving money from Aetna or any other insurance Co. (Steele made more money consulting for Aetna for all those years than you ll make legally as an honest man in your lifeime.) I can walk again, but I can t dress myself, or read a book at one sitting. My IVs began too late because of chicken-hearted MDs & doctors like Alan Steele. I WANT a H-H reaction, I d like Many of them. I felt better for weeks, maybe months after my only one on 400 mg of doxy. I ve ALL the standard PO antibiotics and am moving thru the next standards IV CLaforan best., Vancomycin & Rocephin did nohing. I am saving Doxy for last and if it does nothing I will carry on (or be carried) through my stepdaughter s wedding in May and then schedule an appointment for either of those helpful Clinics in Belgium or Oregon. This search for a near normal life has cost me many worldly goods and I could happily carry on as a healthy 60 year old, but I refuse to be wheeled in for a nice game of Jeopardy and then to some institutions idea of food. I will happily compensate you for REAL help or new ideas. I have been to Boston, New York, Yale, Atlanta, 2 of the Mayo locations, L.A., St. Louis, and a ream of nternet Clinics where I have learned to Visualize a tidy autopsy on some of these paraprofessionals.

My cheeks, around my nose, and chin is really red, warm to touch, bumpy, and very itchy. Can you give me some ideas of what maybe going on? I have taken Benadryl and used Benadryl cream. It's not helping.","Doctor":"Hi,Post-operative all over itching is a matter of concern. But you should not worry as It is a sign of healing and will diminish on its own gradually. Post-operative itching of incisions is absolutely normal.  It is caused by the chemical histamine, which is present in healing wounds.  Some antibiotics cause itching if a patient is sensitive. In these cases, changing antibiotics usually takes care of the problem. It is usually a reaction to a post operative medication.  Narcotics  also cause histamine release and often an antihistamine helps or changing medication can help with the advise of your doctor. Benadryl is great at bed time because it also has some sedation qualities. Don't scratch  the area. Just mildly  rub with soft cloth pad or ice to soothe. washing with Menthol mixed water  for immediate  relief.

If you consider that your lesions increase after smoking marijuana, then you may consider keeping it for pause completely for a few days, even don't consume cannabinoids in any other eatable form.

Major issues: off and on dyspnea (literally feels like my diaphragm is trapped and about every other breath I cannot get deep enough... feels like I need oxygen supplement constantly!). I ve just now recently been getting these strange twerks (perhaps fasciculations) in my limbs and on my face around my eyes. What I can tell you is that the first major incidence of dyspnea occurred Oct. 2013. For about a year leading up to that I had been having chest pain that would feel like a twingy sharp and sometimes tingling sensation every time I breathed in. (I have not experienced the chest pain in quite some time, but the off and on dyspnea has been there ever since last Oct). I have had recent CT scan of the head, chest MRI, chest xrays and chest CT scan. (Last brain MRI was in 2006 which was normal so I think I ll push doc to get that done again). Also have had countless EKGs, been tested for Lupus, TB and Thyroid function. All come back normal. For the breathing I am currently treating with Albuterol and Advair 250/50 for the past couple months- no help. I have not had an official asthma diagnosis but GP prescribed those to help eliminate that possibility in case my breathing issue responded to them. I am currently awaiting a lung function study which won t be until June). I do have epilepsy, both petit mal and grand mal so maybe the fasciculations are actually small continuous seizures ?? Or could that be something worse? Like ALS? I am terrified that I might have ALS. I have a strong family history with neuro issues on my father s side which not only include Epilepsy, but Parkinson s (not ALS that I know of for sure.. but neuro issues are definitely in the fam!) My son was born with sort of a club foot that he needs to get PT for. He also has a curly middle toe on that same foot, and definitely has muscle wasting/atrophy in his left calve-- sort of like the champagne bottle look. He has not gotten an official diagnosis yet as he s not even 2, but they are questioning whether it might be Marie Charcot Tooth or some kind of muscular dystrophy. I share the story about my son because if his condition is indeed neurologic (and it wouldn t surprise me given our family history), then it might also suggest that as his mother I could dealing with some neuro related as well- perhaps a gene mutation that I passed on. I don t want to self diagnose, but I have read that sometimes muscular dystrophy can onset in an adult and some kids that are born to mothers with MD can end up with MD themselves or even something like Marie Charco Tooth. Does Adult onset MD tend to cause fasciculations in all limbs though? Or does this sound more like ALS? I can also tell you that I have not experienced any loss of senses like touch, smell etc. The twitching is in just about every limb and muscle and increases and decreases in intensity but is always there. I do not (yet) have any weakness along with the twitching-- but then again I ve only had the twitching for 4 days now so maybe it s too soon to tell. The twitching and breathing both tend to get more intense at nighttime. Please help! I am not able to get in with my neuro for at least another month and a half! And it s so hard not to have answers. I am a thirty two year old mother of 1. My first onset of the chest pain (which preceded the dyspnea occurred about 5 mos after his delivery. Not sure if there is any connection but didn t think it could hurt to put that out there. Please advise!","Doctor":"for the muscle fasiculations i would request you to start investigating step by step start with electrolytes first sodium potassium calcium and magnesium if they are low supplementing them only would help you if not i request you to undergo nerve conduction studies or emg studies to rule out Als"},{"Patient":"I am a 42 year old female, last year i pick up this flum thing thinkingit is flu, after going to the doctors they thouhgt I may be having TB.

In the early hours of Saturday morning, she complained of getting hot and cold fever. She was itchy and had a severe neck and back ache. She was taken to a 24 hour casualty hospital. The GP took blood to test for German measles. This was found to be negative. Her white blood count was low, signifying a viral infection. She has been taking Purbac, an antibiotic for her skin. In hospital they put up a drip of Cortizone, Buscopan. Perfalgan, Rayson and Zofran. She was released from hospital a couple of hours later. I filled the perscription for tenston, xefo, celestamine and Robaxin and administered this to her. At 10.30pm on Saturday night, she woke us up complaining of extreme itchiness. I took her back to hospital. another drip was put up with Aterax, Maxolon and Phenergan as she was also complaining of stomach ache. Again she was released, only to be readmitted later that night. The GP did urine tests. She tested negatively for Malaria as she had been in a Malaria area the previous week. She was released with the GP saying that she could have been admitted originally with flu type symtoms (sore back, neck) and then the medicine after could have caused an allergic reaction. After a bad nights rest, she woke up with raised red welts on her face, but nothing on her torso. Could this be an allergic reaction to all the medicine or/and the high dose of sulpher in the Purbac or is this Urticaria?

You are right in your assumption that you have developed an allergic reaction to some substance that you are not aware about. You should start taking antihistamine such as Levocetrizine 5 mg (Levocet) or Loratidine 10 mg (Lorfast) once a day for about 5-7 days. This will reduce the swelling and will make the red bumps disappear. After about 10 days to 2 weeks' time, go for a blood test for allergy. This test will show what substance you are allergic to so that you can avoid exposure to it in future. If the antihistamines do not help, then it is not an allergic reaction and you should see either a dermatologist or a dentist for examination of your lips and further investigations to diagnose and treat the condition.I hope this information helps you.Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

My upper lip swelled in the front(no sore, just swelling and irritation), my throat is very red, bumpy and irritated, and three canker sores on the inside of my mouth. After a week or so the canker sores healed and went away. My throat was irritated and continued to look bumpy and red for a couple months. Then winter came. My lip has remained swollen for about 8 months now and with the season turning and warmer weather coming around my throat is irritated again. This all developed after I kissed someone however after visiting a std clinic, an urgant care providor, and my primary physician I was reassured by all three that it is not an std. I was told by one that it was a viral infection and would clear up in a week or two and my primary physician told me it was allergies. Any Ideas?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. Your symptoms do not suggest that you have any STD, thus you can stay relaxed about it. Your symptoms suggests more towards a viral infection, but as your doctor suggested, if it is a viral infection, it should resolve on its own in about a week and only supportive therapy related to symptoms might be needed. The persistent swelling for about 8 months seems to be an allergic reaction to a substance that you use routinely. However, in your case, it might be an allergic reaction along with the viral infection. I would recommend you to go for a blood test for allergy. It will suggest what substance you are allergic to so that you can avoid its exposure. After giving the blood for testing, you should start taking antihistamine such as Levocetrizine 5 mg (Levocet) or Loratidine 10 mg (Lorfast) once a day for about 10 days. If it will be an allergic reaction, the swelling should start to reduce or disappear.If that does not happen, then you should visit a dentist or oral and maxillofacial surgeon for examination of the lip and further investigations directed directly towards the lip swelling. Based on the results, diaggnosis can be made and treatment can be advised.I hope this information helps. Thank you for choosing HCM.

As you are having this line on your lip for about 10 years and you have already tried antifungal agents, it does not seem like a fungal infection. White line on the lip can be due to cheilitis which can occur due to deficiency of Vitamin B12, iron deficiency anemia or allergy to some substance that you are exposed to on routine basis. I would recommend you to start having Vitamin B12 supplements and iron supplements along with including leafy vegetables in your diet. You can also take antihistamine such as Loratidine 10 mg (Lorfast) once a day for about a week to 10 days to combat an allergic reaction, if present.You should give it a month to reduce in size and intensity or disappear completely. If it does not respond to these supplements, I would advise you to go for a biopsy of the lesion as 10 years is a very long time to have a persistent painless lesion on the lip and confirmed diagnosis is necessary. You can visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for the biopsy.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HCM.

It happens many times that a single person is allergic to more than one substances or one substance but that substance is used in many things so it makes a person allergic to many things. As you now know that you are allergic to prawn, do not keep trying it as every time it will cause an allergic reaction and there are chances that it will increase in severity causing complications. As you do not know other substances that may be acting as allergen to you, I would recommend you to go for a blood test for allergy. It will detect all the substances that you are allergic to so you can take care to avoid them. In addition, for the burned area inside the mouth, you can apply Benzocaine Gel (Mucopain) 3-4 times a day. Applying it before meals will make consumption of food easier. Also, you should keep antihistamines such as Levocetrizine 5 mg (Levocet) or Loratidine 10 mg (Lorfast) always at hand so you can start it as soon as reaction starts to develop.I hope this information helps you.

All the symptoms you have described are the health effects on you from the immense stress you are experiencing currently. Due to stress you are not sleep well, and it is making you feel fatigued and foggy in head.

Do activities that you enjoy. Go out with friends or family for meals or movie. As you are suggesting, hormonal changes can also play a role in the stress and health effects you are having. You can consult a mental health professional for counselling sessions. If needed, you can go for prescription medicines till you and your body is ready to cope up with the stress.

The symptoms you have described indicate that you have allergy to some substance. It might be something else that you have had during dinner or from the environment that may have caused the reaction. Sometimes it also happens that body develops allergy to a substance that you have been safely exposed to before. I advise you to take antihistamine such as Levocetrizine 5 mg (Levocet) or Loratidine 10 mg (Lorfast) once a day for about 5-7 days. If it is an allergic reaction, it should come under control with this medication. In addition, if you develop this reaction repeatedly in future, it is necessary to find out what substance is acting as allergen to you and then avoid exposure to it. In that case, you should go for a blood test for allergy. However, if the reaction does not come under control or increases in severity, you should visit a dentist or physician to get the lip examined physically and further investigations and treatment.I hope this answer helps you.

Colitis?","Doctor":"HiNot likely colitis but it could be irritable bowel syndrome or a stool impaction problem. I wouldn't suggest a laxative at this point but see your doctor for an evaluation.  I'd do a rectal exam and get abdominal x-rays to evaluate this"},{"Patient":"I have a DVT factor 8, had this condition for 11 years. I have had pressure in my chest. I have a greenfeather filter. Today I went to the emergency room. They did test and stated after testing INR result was 0.97 low. No clots. They upped my coumadin after being on only 2.5 to 5.0. That was Wednesday. MY INR has not raised, I am worried about why it has not raised. I was sent home told to contact my doctor on Monday. Nothing was given to me to raise it. They did cat scan and testing and found nothing including a blood clot. I have been on 2.5 Mg. for a year. I have not had my INR checked until two weeks ago because the doctor I use to have said it was ok for six months to not have it checked. My new primary said that was not correct. Two week s ago I had a blood clot that the filter did catch. Was taken to Freeman Hospital where they did test, and even a echo of my heart, while doing a stress test. They said it was heart burn!!!! My primary said that was ridiculous that it sounded like I had passed a clot that the filter did catch. Never had this close of a call. Today the right side of my tongue swelled for no reason. The emergency doctor said it (the tongue swelling) was probably something due to an allergic reaction. I am not allergic to anything!!! They found nothing sent me home saying to talk to my primary. I am 42 years of age female never smoked, been in great health. Now these items are coming up. I am scared these doctors are not finding what is wrong even with my condition. Why would my right side of my tongue swell during this?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. It seems that the swelling of tongue that you have developed has nothing to do with the DVT and pressure in chest you are having. I agree with your doctor that it seems to be an allergic reaction. I would advise you to take Antihistamine such as Levocetrizine 5 mg (Levocet) or Loratidine 10 mg (Lorfast) once a day for at least 5 days. If it would be an allergic reaction, you should find immediate improvement in the swelling in 1-2 days. Otherwise, the cause is not allergic. The allergy could be due to anything that you have been exposed to through air, water or food. If the episodes are frequent, you should go for a blood test for allergy to find out what substance you are allergic to and you can avoid exposure to that in future. However, if the swelling does not decrease with the antihistamines or if it increases, then you should consult a dentist to examine the oral cavity and investigate further regarding the cause.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HCM. I wish you feel better soon.Best,Dr. Viraj Shah"},{"Patient":"i had and aerious cortison pil 5 mg ,just a few minutes ago .its 13:00 o clock now. also in the morning i had a 250 cortison injection on my buttchick in 6:45 in the morning . alla that because of an alergic reaction to pine trees. i could breath and see it wasnt so rough but the thing was that i was fully itchy (like more than 200 mosquitos bite me, that was rough ). i m about to take 2 more pills an use a fenistil cream for the rest of the day. does marijuanna do any harm if i smoke it. ??","Doctor":"HelloMarijuana should not react with any of those medications and it would affect your allergic reaction"},{"Patient":"my grand daughter has been tested possiviive for the TOE alergens, trichophyton-candida-and-epidermoph, but my resurch has come up with very little. why are these grouped together, skin fungal and an internalyeast bacteria? what is the relation/link between the two?","Doctor":"Hi there! There are broadly 2 kinds of fungi which could infect skin. one type needs keratin to grow like Trichophyton or epidermophyton because of which it tends to grow on Skin Nails n Hair where Keratin is abundant. These do not grow inside the body. While Candida can grow on skin and inside the body too. Mostly moist areas like Groin, Vagina etc. For nail infection especially toe nails the medication needs to be taken for a long time because the drug concentration patterns in these areas need them to be so.

So even after providing inhalation the symptoms of breathlessness don't subside and produce cough back to back. I will advice to do stem inhalation and also breathing exercises. Steam inhalation will help loosen the secretion of the lungs and breathing exercises will help improve the lung capacity and strengthen the muscles of respiration.Also , taking a help from a physical therapist will not be bad as they can help understand how to perform the breathing exercises . the breathing exercises include -* deep breathing exercises* abdominal breathing exercises* diaphragmatic breathing exercises* costal breathing exercises* pursed lip breathing exercises* huffing & coughing technique.in my clinical practice I see cases with breathing disorders. and by teaching them how to perform breathing exercises have helped them practice in home and optimum results are achieved.

I recently started developing small red bumps on my arms and it s spreading to my shoulder blades. They are about the size of a mm and have yellow or white liquid in them. They are a little painful. I am sensitive to allergies and I m wondering if they are an allergic reaction or bug bites","Doctor":"Thank you for your query. The bumps seem to be vesicles Would you please clarify a few things for me? 1)have you had chicken pox /varicella? 2)do you see any bite marks on the affected arm? 3)have you been outdoors, camping for instance? Was there any contact or exposure to poison ivy or oak? 4)are you on any medications? 5)did you have any pain., itching or tingling on the affected area before the vesicles appeared? 6)are they limited to one side of the body? Herpes zoster /Shingles start out as altered sensation on the skin (pain/itching/tingling)with redness, usually on side of the body and limited to a specific area. It occurs in those individuals who already had chicken pox,  by the reactivation of the virus that remains dormant in the nervous system. This then progress to form vesicles which appear in clusterand is filled with clear fluid which may become infected (pustules). The pain is usually severe. This resolves. In a couple of weeks although the scabs on the healing vesicles may take longer to disappear. Poison ivy or oak may cause these lesion. Intense pruritus (itching), pain and redness of underlying skin occurs. Allergic reaction will usually have a trigger (known allergens like insect venom, certain food items, medications for instance) and will result in a generalized (all over the body)  rash (without fluid), unless it is contact dermatitis  (in which case it will be localized to the area of contact with the allergen). Bug bites can be identified by bite marks and may resemble an allergic reaction (if you were already allergic to it) or it may have a reaction limited to area immediately surrounding the bite. Certain systemic infections may cause cutaneous manifestation. I recommend you see your physician/dermatologist who could assess, diagnose and treat it. Do not apply any OTC medications without consulting your doctor. Some of these contains corticosteroids that will worsen the rash if it is an infection. Keep the area clean and dry, wear clothes made of breathable materialike cotton, avoid hot showers. If the rash or pain is too severe, fever more than 102F occurs, or any worrying symptom like lethargy, severe headache, giddiness is present,  go to the ER right away. Hope this helps.

Generally healthy. Had asthma as a child. Frequently gets chest congestion. Right now has chest congestion, achy, feels warm to touch, but also notices an increase I need to urinate. That is a new symptom. Is there any connection between the two?","Doctor":"Hi welcome to HCM I can understand your concern for your husband.s frequent chest congestion, body aches and increased  urge to urinate .  It is a matter of concern  but not cause for worry . For your info , our body works as a unit . If one problem arises  any where in our body , the other will follow due to  reaction of meds or otherwise .mOne thing is sure that  our health depends on what we eat , when we eat and how we eat and also our life style and activity level . However, several harmful substances damage our immune system  and the airways and threaten the lungs’ ability to work properly, which can lead to lung disease and results in Asthma and other health problems .The healthy lungs  works  very well most of the time, keeping out dirt and fighting off germs and save you from congestion .Regular  Deep Breathing and yogic postures and walk  feeds oxygen to every cell in the body and strengthen  our immune system .  Without sufficient oxygen, you are more prone to lung problems and even heart disease. You can easily strengthen your lungs. It can also help clear out toxins that may have built up in the lungs. This in turn helps improve lung performance and clear airways and gets you relief from AsthmaThere are many things that you can do to keep your lungs functioning properly. Simple lifestyle changes, dietary changes and healthy habits can lead to lung health . Some Food items which increase mucus , should be Avoided in your daily diet .Avoidance of fast foods , fat , smoking , fine floors , spicy & sour items inactive life , smoking  all  will help lead to health .Do  Kunjjal  - Drink 5-6 glasses of salty luke warm water empty stomach -retain for  2-3 minutes and vomit and force vomit .

This will help remove phlegm from your throat and allow you to sleep better.Onions have anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce constriction of the airways when suffering from asthma. Also, the sulfur content in onions helps decrease inflammation in the lungs.A level spoon of Turmeric powder with a hot cup of cow's milk serve as antibiotic ,antiseptic and antioxidant in natural form Use of tea prepared with giloy , ginger ,tulsi /basil .black pepper  works wonder for chest congestion . Crushed garlic 3-4 cloves with a spoon of honey  helps decongest  the lungs Avoid dehydration ,constipation, stress .Hope this helps solve your query .

She is a nondiabetic, non hypertensive with no history of previous CAD. She first presented with Atrial fibrillation 2 years back which was controlled on Diltiazem, initially on 120 mg bd but later on 90 bd. Her respiratory status also decompensated and she started regular requirement for oral bronchodilators, antibiotics as indicated, regular Inhaled corticosteroids which were at times given upto 4000 Ug/day. Rescue therapy with oral steroids were also given off & on. Her sudden decompensation started in December of 2009, when her nebulization requirements increased and she was initially started on Augmentin for a 10- day period. She then became oxygen dependant . Her work up for Tuberculosis was noncontributory and her autoimmune profile in the form of ANA, pANCA  were also normal. Based on the picture of rising oxygen requirements, antibiotics were given as follows: Antibiotic history Early Nov, 2009 - Piperacillin + Tazobactum (10 days) Late Nov, 2009 - Tab Azithromycin (7 days) Jan 16, 2010 - Injection Clindamycin (7 days) + injection Moxifloxacin (till Mar 8, 2010) Jan 22, 2010 - injection Moxifloxacin (till Mar 8, 2010) + Tab Faropenem (6 days) Jan 31, 2010 - tab Moxiflox + Isoniazid + Ethambutol  This was empirically stated by the Pulmonologist along with Pulse methylprednisolone   CT Scan  of her  chest revealed picture of Interstitial Lung Disease. She showed some response and her oxygen requirements decreased from 2 l/min to 0.5 l/min. Her general condition stabilized for a few days. Feb 28, 2010 - tab Moxiflox + Isoniazid + Ethambutol + Injection Ertapenem (1 gm OD up to Mar 8th, 2010) She showed deterioration at this time with pedal oedema  which gradually increased to anasarca. Her LFTâ??s were normal but her total protein fell to 6.2 gm. She was started on sidenafil for her Pulmonary artery hypertension  and torsemide for her Congestive heart failure which was interpreted as  Cor pulmonale. The cardiologist at this point of time reduced steroids as she developed leucocytosis, raised CRP, bandemia on peripheral smear and altered GTT. On stoppage of steroids she slumbered to CO2 narcosis which reached 100 torr and she had to be put on BIPAP. Her counts at admission to the Respiratory ICU were 18, 800 and she was initiated on Mar 8, 2010 - Inj Imipenem + Inj Cilastatin + Injection Teicoplanin (400 mg OD) for 4 days. The counts increased progressively to reach 26,900 with mainly polymorphic response upto 89%. Her procalcitonin levels were high but galactomannan were negative. She was initiated on Mar 10, 2010 - Injection Tazobactum + Piperacillin TDS for 3 days, + Injection Tigecycline 50 mg BD + Inj Voriconazole. Her counts stabilized for 48 hours but are again showing a rise. Her general condition is improving, her cognition has improved, her blood gases show normoxemia with permissible hypercapnia (50-60) Till date cultures sent every day have been sterile.

This is a great news that cardiac problems are ruled out by the tests every time in the emergency Room. This means that we have to find a local cause in the abdomen itself. I would suggest the following:Get Ct scan and MRCP for the hepato-biliary- pancreatic system .Also go for upper GI Endoscopy to rule out Gastric ulcer . cancer.Colonoscopy for the possible problem of the colon in this area. If required a diagnostic Laparascopy may help to see or rule out the intestinal adhesion due to bands or kinking or so and can be tackled at the same time. This way a final diagnosis and treatment plan can be done to get you permanent results."},{"Patient":"My upper body feels as if it's sunburned.

I get pains in my chest and upper back occasionally. About 18 months ago they got so bad that I was sent for an x-ray. It came back clear. They flared up again recently, and I had another taken. Again clear. The doctor said it must be costochondritis. I also suffer with pretty regular hoarseness and sore throats, plus what's been diagnosed as allergy-induced asthma (without inhalers I have random coughing fits). About a month ago the doctor gave me some antibiotics for a sinus/tonsil complaint. I have no cough. This week I again began to wake with chest pains, which became back pains later in the day. When I expectorated this morning I had mostly white sputum, but then two were a dirty green. More worryingly, one had a pea-sized lump of dark red blood in it. Almost purple. Should I go back to the doctor? Could the previous x-rays have been wrong? Or might it be a problem with my aesophagus?I am 37 and otherwise pretty fit, cycling for an hour a day and playing sport on the weekend. I don't smoke now, but did for about 15 years.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern.  Chronic cough is commonly seen in bronchitis and lung infection. Since your chest x ray is normal, no need to worry for lung infection. Possibility of bronchitis is more in your case. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT is needed for the diagnosis of bronchitis. It will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only.

She is 17 and had her gall bladder out 1 year ago February and has titanium clips. Looooong story, countless tests, procedures, different therapies with no results, many doctors, including a specialist at Children s, and titanium allergy is the one possibility that no one has looked at and when I finally brought it up with the last specialist we saw, it was dismissed. The good news is that the doctors believe her, they see that her pain and symptoms are real, (just thought I d mention this). Now for the question: what do I need to do to get a MELISA test for her? At this point I just feel we are on our own. If doctors are reluctant to entertain this idea then how can I get this test so as to know whether or not to eliminate it? We live in southeast Idaho.

He suggested Zyrtec at night but the next day after taking it I got red and itchy on my arm and other areas became uncomfortable like needing to continually crack my neck, back and mainly my two fingers on my right hand. The pharmacy suggested Benadryl but that did not help. Now it s been going on a few days, my itchy red fingers hat continually need to be cracked for relief were swollen and red this morning and very painful near the joint and continue to be painful although swelling went down a good bit throughout he day.

I am very worried, what could this be?","Doctor":"HI, Thanks for using healthcare magic,Itching and redness all over body like fingers,arms,neck etc and high levels of histamine in blood could be possibly an allergic reaction to something. You should consider the use of an anti histamine to dampen the response. An example would be levocetrizine or fexofenadine a good choice inplace of benadryl.There are also some creams which may soothe the itching,examples include calamine lotion or menthol in aqueous cream.You need to be further clinically examined by dermatologoist for proper diagnosis and treatment.I hope this helps,Regards,"},{"Patient":"8 years ago I had a radical hysterectomy for endometrial cancer.

Presence of bruise is suggestive of internal bleeding underneath the skin or subcutaneous tissue. It may or may not be related to your previous cancer history but caution is the word.

If a person has allergiy to dairy products is most likely to have loose motions following the same which on the long run causes vitamin deficiencies which can explain the constant tiredness.The person will have to avoid dairy products at least till symptoms subside and if they want can replace with Soy milk or coconut milk. Also for the vitamin deficiencies an oral multivitamin supplement twice a day with meals should help. If oral supplements do not help then intramuscular or intravenous supplements may do the trick. The orange nail may also be due to vitamin deficiencies and if it recurs its better to consult a dermatologist. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I have a sharp pin in my lower abdomen if I cough whilst laying down, or if I stand from a sitting position quickly?

How to cure this permanently and what should we do so thins doesn t happen again.","Doctor":"HiI feel your concern. Doctors of modern medicine have done their best and we all the doctors strive hard to relieve the patient. In your child's case the best treatment could be Ayurveda which is safe and harmless and doesn't have any side effects or interaction with other drugs of modern science if at all, you have to give concurrently.Allergens can be anything found around - in atmosphere, in food, in toiletries, in water, milk - anything. Body should be able to resist by natural strong immunity or enhanced immunity. If infection takes place, same is dealt by different measures.Ayurveda has classical formulae designed for children having Piper longum herb in centre, either independently or in combo with other herbominerals.These cleanse the brochopulmonary region of allergens, cough, infections, detoxifies the body etc. Now the dry and productive cough has to be dealt with various combos to be given honey and warm water.If I were your family doctor, I had advised and insisted to give your child Balchaturbhadra Chooran (a combo of four safe herbs), godnati bhasm and mrigshring bhasm and Sitopaladi choorana  in honey and Kantkaryavaleh (in syrup form) for over four to eight weeks to assess the progress. Little turmeric powder may also be added to this combo.This is safest, harmless, non toxic but little slow to act being natural. Once cured, the allergens and infections will not attack again anytime soon. It enhances resistance against various causes.For any further query pl feel free to ask through direct question for any help. This medicine is commonly available in India or can be found on net.Hope its useful for your child too. All the best."},{"Patient":"I had sinus congestion, pain in early April. 10 days prior I had a temporary cap put on an upper right molar . I went to ENT . Did a scope in office, placed on 6 day medpred. After 1 week , congestion and headaches , especially when awakened, back to ENT , now steroid injections in to turbinate sinus . These shots 1 per week x 3 then every 3 months . After 2 nd shot mentioned to ENT , my cap tooth. Told me to go back to dentist . Went to dentist started root canal on tooth. After 2 nd visit to dentist , asked to just pull tooth. Congestion and headaches remain .cat scan of sinuses done, nothing remarkable Followed up with ENT . Sent me to allergist . Had allergy skin tests , not reactive to anything. Allergist suggested using Mucinex D . Used for 1 week with some relief. Started on Flonase 2pumps per nostril once a day. First day seemed to help. Second day seemed to make congestion worse. Back to ENT another 6 days of med pred. No change . Begged to try antibiotics , augmentin given, on day 6 out of 10 , still with congestion, maybe a slight bit better. Headaches every night . I do not sleep more then a few hours each night. It s going on over 2 months. Through all tried net pot too. Nose seems very try at all times . Some dental pain too. Could this all be from my tooth extraction. Sometimes wonder if there is a connection between sinus and upper jawbone . Desperate .","Doctor":"Hello dear,After going through your history, I believe you have some genuine concern and I will try to help you out of this situation.Our nose is surrounded by sinuses. Sinuses are empty cave like spaces in the facial bones with their mouth opening into the nose. These opening are very small and lined by epithelium same as that of nose. In a normal situation when we breathe, air enters the sinuses and ventilate them. Also there is constant production of fluids inside the sinuses, which drain out through the small opening to the nose.When nose is affected with some infection, even common cold, the epithelium swells and so the epithelium around the mouth of the sinuses. Now the sinuses can not be ventilated nor can be drained. This leads to deposition of fluid inside the sinuses and SINUSITIS. Any anatomical defect like DNS (Deviated nasal septum). Hypertrophied turbinates and other abnormalities only add to the risk of development of sinusitis. Addressing your concern with the relation of upper jaw bone ( Maxilla) with sinus, I would say you are right. The Pre-molar and the molar teeth ( Last 5 teeth used for chewing)  in upper jaw have got longer roots and the parting bony wall between the sinus and tooth root may be very thin or even it may be absent. So even tooth infection can travel to the sinus. It is not uncommon that after any dental procedure over these teeth recurrent sinusitis develop due to a new connection between the root of tooth and sinus.In your situation, I believe there is similar communication between your sinus and tooth root which is leading to your suffering.In my clinic in cases like you I advise them to go for a CT scan PNS ( Para nasal sinuses) to see any hidden pathology inside the nose and sinuses and also any communication as I have specified and  manage according to the report. I hope I could solve your query. Please do not hesitate to clarify more doubts for the same situation.Thank you for the way you are in my life.Dr Ipsit Panda"},{"Patient":"I have been having terrible allergy problems in the past month.

But it is overwhelming, and to the point I feel it s coming from my own nose. Even taking OTC allergy meds., I am constanty using nasal spray, Afrin, as I have used all my life because of smoke allergies, sneezing constantly, burning eyes, eyes watering. What can it be.

Candles gone, nothing with kerosene in my home, but I cannot get this smell out of my nose it seems. My head hurts on a daily, most especially nightly basis. Eyes are very sensitive to lights, especially tv light at night, I ve been wearing sunshades while watching tv at night because I cannot stand the bright light.","Doctor":"Hello dear,On going through your history, it seems you have a genuine situation and I'll try my best to help you out of it.  Allergy is a disease gifted my God and it is transmitted form one generation to next. Also the Gift lasts for whole life unless addressed properly.The allergens what ever it may be, be it environmental or dietary or contact, they eventually lead to reaction in blood which then progress to symptoms in nose, ear, throat, skin or lungs.We ( And some doctors also) are ignorant of it and usually try to treat the symptoms and never care for the curing the condition in blood.In my clinic I advise my patient to go for a skin prick test where allergens are introduced into the superficial layer of the skin and the offending one gives a positive reaction by creation of a whale. Now basing on this result, Immunotherapy can be started in which drops for the specific allergen is taken sublingually for a period of atleast 2 years.The efficacy rate of this treatment is upto 90%. I advice you to study about this on internet and find a suitable Allergy specialist to address your concern.I hope I brought some relief  to your anxiety.

I have never got any kind of acne or pimples on my face in earlier life and my skin is normal but little dry sometimes with a very sensitive nature. Therefore, I don t use any harsh cream or go through any facials regularly. All I do for my skin is cleansing. We had a function on 07.06.2014 and I went for a facial on 05.06.2014 for the first time. I had a little itchy skin that time and two or three pustules on my face before that facial. But I vanished them by putting Soframycin overnight. But as of now, I have been allergic on my face. I got lot many pimples and they are too scratchy and red in color. I have been to a dermatologist. He gave me allergic tabs plus a lotion and one other cream to put on those pimples. Today is the first day I will start using them for next ten days. I need to know that what could be the reason for this allergy so that I would remain cautious for next time. The reasons which I believe that could be: 1. From 25th may, I started applying daily a mixture of milk (boiled) with turmeric on my face, neck and arms as well before I take bath which was supposed to be applied for a natural glow. 2. I was using an old cleansing milk too from last 15 days, which I saw today, that the same has already been expired in 2013. 3. That facial could be a reason as I have gone through the same for the first time. But I have had a few pustules before the same. 4. Another thing is, on the very next day I have gone through the facial, i.e. on 06.06.2014, We had some breakage work at home, and the time the labor completed their work and the cleaning of cement and dust was started, I started getting my skin more itchy and even flammable. Then I washed my face with cold water and mild soap & was feeling better after doing so. It was all fine with my skin during 07.06.2014. I done mild makeup too on my skin but got no rashes, itching or any kind of inflammation but all of a sudden on 09.06.2014 I got allergic reaction and went for a doctor today. I was using that cleansing milk during these two days for makeup removal too. Kindly let me know the exact reason or the most probable one so that I can take care of my skin in future.

First off he was born three months early weighing one pound four ounces and twelve inches long. He has severe asthma and allergies. He s strong but no body fat what so ever. Anyway ever since I can remember he has had a twitch. First it started with him literally kicking himself in the butt, now he really only did that when he was nervous or anxious, everyone got on his case about him doing that because it annoyed them, he gradually quit doing it and we moved on. For the last 3 years he has now developed several twitches that he doesn t realize/comprehend that he is doing it. While watching tv, riding in a vehicle, or simply just having a conversation with some one, he has started twitching his head from side to side, up and down, twitches his eyebrows uncontrollably, or snaps his fingers for no reason. I have asked him repeatedly why he does these things and he says he doesn t realize he s doing them. Now I have seen him do it more intensely when he is anxious or nervous, but I am truly worried for his well being. I ve read about torrets and I ve read about Huntingtons and some of these symptoms are exactly what my brother has. Neither side of our family has either of these diseases. So my question I guess is can a person get these diseases with out it being in your gene pool. I m not talking about air borne stuff I m not an idiot, I m more interested in if it s linked to a genetic mutation, or if it s been in our gene pool and has just not surfaced until my brother came along being a premature baby, also he was a twin the smaller of the twins, the other twin has none of these issues. If you could shed some light on this subject for me that would be great thank you.","Doctor":"Thanx for writing us.... Asthma has only palliative treatment.

About 8 years ago I tried Zyban (wellbutrin) I cant remember which, and it was working great for about 3 weeks, and it really helped reduce the cravings and I felt great.But- then I started getting itching in my palms and bottom of feet, and in a few days my skin started literally peeling off.  No redness or obvious blisters, just sort of came off in layers,  After discussing with my PCP i discontinued the drug.2 questions- 1 -Do you think it might be safe to try  it again?  If it did not get too severe it might be able to live with it for awhile2 - Could Chantix cause similar reactions- is it based on the same compounds, or ingredients?

Regarding over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, I would suggest my such patients to take an antihistamine like cetirizine for 3-5 days to look for improvement.

At present, from your provided history, I would like to make suggestions for him as follows:1. Only after knowing more details and investigations like spirometry, I would like to diagnose as \\"cough variant asthma\\". Till then, there are many alternative possibilities.2. Inhalers (I guess brown one is the preventer and blue one is the rescue inhaler) are usually good in asthma. However, if he is not responding to them, I would think of two possibilities:a. Technique of using inhalers could be wrong - please verify the inhaler technique in front of your doctor. Please shake the inhaler vigorously before use. Please use spacer with inhaler, if not using. Make sure your son gargles after each use of inhaler.b. He may respond to other anti-asthma drugs like montelukast. In that case, I would prescribe him montelukast. However, before that, I would like to confirm his diagnosis.c. He might not have cough variant asthma.3. For children with exercise induced bronchospasm, I also prescribe vitamin C for at least 1 month which helps.4. As he has long standing cough, I would suggest him regularly warm saline gargles twice a day.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your son the best of the health ahead.Thank you very much & regards."},{"Patient":"hi my name is marie , i am 21 years old. lately i have been diagnosed with citric intolerance. i was feeling ok since was handling the intolerance by avoiding food with high percentage of citric acid. a week a go , i did an anaphylaxis reaction after taking a pill i used to talk for my skin( makari) , i smoked and 10 min after that the reaction started. i first taught it was the pill, so i did smoke again and 30 second later i did another anaphylaxis reaction. since then i am not feeling good, the symptom of the anaphylaxis still come up everyday. i have the feeling of fishbones in my throat. i diet , i barely eat because i am so scared that something i will eat will bring it back again. what can i do?","Doctor":"You need to undergo a detailed allergic skin testing with suspected antigens so that steps can be taken to avoid the same.

I am healthy and have a colonoscopy, and my gall bladder has been removed.","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query and an elucidate history. Pain on the left side of the abdomen in lying sown position and betting enhanced by deep breathing can be due to the following reasons. There may be Costochondritis, lower lung or pleura problem  or a small intervertebral disc causing pressure symptoms only on lying down but getting disimpacted on standing up. History of relief on standing for going for urination proves this. Also the history of pain only at the night can be explained by this.I would advise you the following:MRI of the spine. CT can of the abdomen for the kidney, power lungs and other structures in this area. A proper diagnosis will help you to get a proper treatment and relief."},{"Patient":"hi Ive had rheumatoid nodules on my elbow for several years know , after each operation to remove them they regrow , the doctor says that I do not have the artheritis though.for the past 12 months I have been having allergy attacks and itching on my hands between the fingers and eyes this usually goes within 24hrs of starting.I have tried antihistimenes but these dont work I also get very tired during the day could this all be related and what should I do Iam 44 not overweight walk every morning with the dog the problem with the elbow started about 8 years ago and to date it has been operated on 4 times and Iam waiting to see a surgeon again","Doctor":"All that I can convey to you on the basis of my three decades old clinical experience is that you must get support of Ayurveda treatment.While surgery can remove nodules, it cannot prevent regrowing. Here Ayurveda can help you in a safe n side-effect less way.Similarly anti 'PittVata' regime in Ayurveda can effectively manage allergic conditions and common herbs can be used to address it.No interaction of any ayurveda med. with any other drug gives it upper hand to try parallel with your current regime initially and then switch gradually.If you agree, may write direct question for further advise with report of nodules and surgery and small medical history."},{"Patient":"i have been having an allergic reaction while having a bowel movement.  In the past week it has happened 3 times, and it gets worse every time, first time just red and itchy, next time red and itchy and lips swelled and this last time, red and ithcy all over with hives and swelling in the hands feet and lips.","Doctor":"Whenever any allergen is made to enter body through any route and it manifests reactions, re entry of same/ similar allergens knowingly or unknowingly, into same body manifests reaction manifolds and it keeps on multiplying.The basic rule is NIDAANPARIVARJAN (in sanskrit language) i.e. avoidance of cause. Still if it can't be avoided anti allergics are given. If not found effective, immunity of body should be raised to resist allergies.Here Ayurveda has an important and sustainable treatment to offer by way of natural herbal combos. It enhances immunity by balancing vitiation of 'Vata Pitta' humors which are culprits to cause allergy.Simple herbs like Neem, curcumin, Manjishtha etc are effectively controlling such conditions practically. It may act slow but what have fast acting toxic drugs done so many years? So its prudent to opt for herbals which are safe and have no interaction problem with other current drugs. These raise strength of immunity in the body.If interested, may write direct question for further advise and treatment. Pl inform little medical history and latest reports, if any."},{"Patient":"Do you take multiple chemical sensitivities seriously and understand how debilitating fragrance chemicals are? Do you think there is always an under-lying cause for scent sensitivity/allergy (yes, I have allergic reactions to dryer sheets like Bounce and Scent Boosters)ie rash hot prickly skin, swelling of tongue, extreme thirst... do you think (my) immune system was already compromised or do you think the neurotoxic petro chemicals in fragrance products alone can cut a person s life down to the knees overnight?","Doctor":"It's a very good question and thousands of people who read it, I fact, can reap the benefits out of suggestions given herein, based on the principles of Ayurveda - the nascent science of life.First of all there is a principle cited in Ayurveda about how to prevent/ cure a disease. It's 'NIDAANPARIVARJAN' (in Sanskrit language) which literally means 'avoidance of the cause'.Now, in many cases people are not able to change jobs or circumstances are such that they have to continue to remain in such conditions. Here comes the principle of PRAANVAYU (richness of oxygen and fresh air) that is achieved by rythms of deep breathing exercises called PRAANAYAM.India's Yoga has spread to the World and people who are aware are enjoying the benefits. It enhances immunity, gives strength to fight allergens and extends life as also betters quality of life.Then there are herbs to naturally support the fight of body against allergens. Simple herbs like Turmeric, Neem, Manjishtha, Giloy, Tulasi (Holy basil) etc. not only counter allergens but detoxifies the blood and also raise natural immunity.The hitch among beginners is its slow pace of action. Yes naturals are slow as compared to man made synthetic and toxic medicines but then what advantage have these fast drugs given over a time period. No doubt modern synthetics have won in emergency situations and saved lives. But lifestyle disorders and the one you are suffering from needs naturals to support you. These do not have side effects, no interaction with drugs, are safe over prolonged use too. What else you need?Why not try it. For any further questions please write direct. To my own patients I would suggest to adopt natural Ayurveda medicine. Initially both your current medicine and Ayurveda may be used parallel with some gaps and gradually switch fully if you see advantage.Hope it helps."},{"Patient":"Hi I'm a 17yr old and I have recently just started to have cold like symptoms and it's the 3rd day I.

Like showering in upper Sweden (Stockholm) the itching was much less extreme, as well the water in France. (Avigon) Another detail is that if I have been in contact with water first, it will start itching and what not, but the second time (after becoming dry first, and that takes several minutes) it won't itch or anything. I will become a little red, but that's about it. My skin also reacts from sweat. It also doesn't matter matter what temperature it is.The skin doctors have told me that this would most likely disappear some years ago, but it's becoming worse. At first, it was only on my chest and on my back. Now, it's spreading to my stomach, arms, entire back, and thighs, and instead of just itching, it burns as well. I would be so grateful if you could help me! Swimming has always been a great passion to me, and taking relaxing baths is always something I have loved... however, it's hard to enjoy water when I become like this. It's torture, and it makes me so sad I can't find help. What could this be? Is there anything I should try out? Thank you!","Doctor":"Your body seems to be allergic to something in the water. Because you not feeling equally bad with the water at Stockholm and France, the dissolved contents in water must be troubling you. But, what is to be remembered is that we can not change the water always, so we need to change your body's constitution and make it less sensitive like any other's skin.1st - For this you need to have a proper workup of your case to find out if there is any allergic or Autoimmune process causing this in your body. You need to discuss this with your doctor.2nd - Homeopathy also can help you. There are certain remedies in Homeopathy which can change your body's constitution and reduce your body's sensitiveness. Consult a good Homeopath also who can understand your case and systematically analyse and treat you in the proper medical lines."},{"Patient":"I have recently been diagnosed with alpha gal.

Perhaps if the dizziness is not troubling your day to day work, then you may wait for few days. Until then you may take proper hydration and electrolyte balance with some symptomatic antihistamines treatment like betahistidine. Do not panic.However if the problem is persistent, you should see a doctor at the earliest and get evaluated further. I will suggest you undergo routine blood count, ESR, blood electrolytes, tests for vestibular (balance) system like electronystagmography or rotation tests to diagnose the cause for dizziness. Your local physician or GP will know about the test.

People are using them to treat everything from insomnia, weight loss, to allergies. They are even telling people to take the oils internally without dilution. One of the main companies is even telling its sales people (they are MLM companies) that people cannot be allergic to essential oils because the molecules are too small to cause an allergic reaction to them and that if a person has a reaction it is a not an a allergic one but the body detoxing.

I have been unable to find a medical opinion of this online. Here is a link to what they are promoting","Doctor":"Allergies can be caused by anything on this planet until your defennce mechanism is so strong that anything foreign is not able to disturb your body or functions.In Ayurveda, the principle of balancing Pitta Kapha vitiation by using non toxic safe herbals, may win over such allergies.Hope it helps you to assess an indication to use herbals in such cases, without fear."},{"Patient":"Have taken azithromycin for bronchial asthmatic infection. Taking 250 mg for last 4 days. Have one pill left. My condition is completely better but the med. is causing me to have a bad stomach and a dizzy feeling. Would it do any harm if I didn t take that last pill?","Doctor":"Hello,First of all bronchial asthma is not an infection. It is a condition in which there is spasm of bronchial muscles and airpipe which causes breathing difficulty. Whenever we start any antibiotic, the course should be completed even if you are feeling better before the course gets completed. The reason behind it is if you do not complete the course, the bacteria or infective agent develops resistant to the antibiotic which you didn't complete the course.And next time if you again get the infection by the same infective agent, the antibiotic won't work the next time and you will need higher antibiotic.So whenever you are put on any antibiotic make sure you complete the course as per prescribed by your doctor.

No allergy test can be comprehensive enough to determine full range of allergens. Only a sufferer is the best assessor to find the cause/ causes by closely watching routinely intermittently/ sporadically used things orally or externally to see if something causes reaction or allergy.Every drug has side effects. In some its more, in others its lesser.To our own patients we treat on the basis of Ayurvedic principles to manage the vitiation of 'Kapha pitta' humors. It's a basic treatment where body becomes strong/ immune enough to stand against allergens.Turmeric, Neem and Sugarcandy powders are given in a combo to come out of chaos in a few weeks. No side effects. No interaction, very safe. Haridra Khand - a coarse powder of Ayurveda classics is also medicine of choice in such situations.

Allow to cool (Lukewarm). Mix honey 1 tsp to it. Add little turmeric, say 1/4 tsp. Drink it slowly. Rather sip it. May do it twice or thrice too. In few days you will start feeling better.

In the morning, mash little bit, filter it and wash eyes with it. It may strain fabrics, wear accordingly. Do for one to two weeks. Avoid contact lense. Alternatively Triphala capsules of Himalya co. are also available but it would be costlier to take out suffucient powder for soaking.After washing put pure rose water drops in eyes.

Five months ago I started Cimzia for RA. Three weeks ago I got Coxsackie virus. After the Coxsackie dried up a week ago, I developed Urticaria. With the urticaria I have been on and off my medications. My PCP believes that the urticaria might be triggered by the combination of Cimzia and Arava. On the other hand, my immunologist thinks that the urticaria is a consequence of the coxsackie virus. My blood tests seem to be normal, excluding my sugar which is over 200 because of the prednisone that I have been taken for the urticaria. I am also taking allegra, cingulair, zantac, zyrtec, and sometimes benadryl. However, my urticaria gets worse and worse. The patches and itchiness is indescribable. At this point, I don’t know what to do or what to take to control the symptoms of the urticaria. I went to the ER twice. The ER doctors control the urticaria symptoms while I am at the hospital but once I get back home, all symptoms persist.

Sugarcandy powder is also given but not in your case since you are diabetic.For curing sugar Meshashringi and Karela capsules are given to my patients.All above are pure herbals, without side effects and can be used for very long time. No interaction with other medicines reported ever.In about 2 months you will start feeling relief in RA also. Hives may start vanishing in first two weeks.Hope you get benefit if this advise on HCM."},{"Patient":"Is it possible I am allergic to composite resin fillings? I had a bunch of gumline cavities filled with composite resin. After the top teeth were done my upper lip swelled. MD thought I had a spider bite and treated as such. After bottom teeth were filled  both upper and lower lips swelled. DDS thought it might be latex allergy. Steroids and antihistamines reduced swelling in two days. Now three weeks later I woke up in middle of the night with both lips swollen again. I have not had any recent dental treatment. Could I be allergic to the fillings?","Doctor":"Allergies can be caused by anything and sufferer himself is the best judge to assess it. No machines or tests can 100% diagnose it. These only help.However, before you take any decision to remove fillings,  try to take combo of turmeric powder, Neem leaves powder and Sugarcandy powder in 1:1:1 ratio. Slightest improvement or relief will indicate that it's working for you. It's safe combo. No side effects. No interaction with other medicines.May continue till it cures fully. Slow pace of cure  should not be a distractor for you.Hope it helps you."},{"Patient":"my daughter is 11.11.2006 born..has rhinities allergiey from birth..shifted to pune from indore a mnth bk..since 3 days complaning abt thumb of right leg aching..yday eve i noticed swelling n redness...her eyes were also lil' swollen n lil' feverish..rushed to nearby doc who suggested livorid..n a paracetomol syrup..since mrng i noticed redness in whole body..especially back n front..nt interested in eating..spoke to her older doc in indore who suggested alerid 5 ml n ibugesic + 7.5 ml...no fever nw..but complaining stomach ache..","Doctor":"If she has rhinitis allergy and swollen eyes, PCM and ibugesic and alerid type of medicine will give quick but temporary relief.

Teachers and children are getting very sick. We are experiencing asthma, shortness of breathe, coughing, rashes and many other symptoms. Where in Maryland can we go to be tested for mold in our bodies beside an allergy doctor.","Doctor":"Thanks for the question.Asthma and related symptoms can certainly be very uncomfortable. You rightly recognize mold as an asthmatic trigger, something that irritates the lungs when inhaled and causes asthma attacks. Fortunately, the amount of mold that is inhaled is very small, and there is no need to have any kind of testing for mold in your body. On very rare occasions, people who are immunocompromised can get fungal infections in the lung, or a specific chronic fungal irritation known as Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA), but these are rare and very likely not relevant here. If you are especially concerned, you can visit your primary care doctor for further diagnosis and treatment. For now, my only recommendation is to stay away from that mold!I hope this helps.Dr. Sheppe"},{"Patient":"I began a new job with new kids, the environment is different.

Ive been on the z pack for five days not coughing any mor but ears are blowing up. My old MD used to give me a cortizone shot. HELP","Doctor":"Thanks for the question.What you are describing certainly sounds like allergies. Bronchitis as well can be allergic in nature, or infectious, but probably allergic the way you describe it here. A Z-Pack, or azithromycin, is actually usually over-prescribed, as it does not help will allergic cough, only infectious cough. Treatment of allergies is really best done with antihistamines, such as loratadine or diphenhydramine, both of which are over-the-counter. If cough persists, you may benefit from treatment of asthma, such as an albuterol inhaler. A cortisone shot for allergic cough would only be helpful in rare or emergent circumstances.I would recommend trying these over-the-counter remedies, or returning to your primary care doctor for further discussion.I hope this helps.Dr. Sheppe"},{"Patient":"im 29, a male , asthmatic by  birth,i started having iregular heartbeat but diagnosed it with verapamil,later i noticed when i get hungry, i occasionaly have a skipped heavy heartbeat,i hear it in my head and when i wake from sleep,i hear my heartbeat for more than 20 mins","Doctor":"Thank you for writing to HCMAre you on any medication for asthma? The medication used for asthma is a beta agonist which means that it activates the beta channels in the body. This can also activate the heart and cause the arrhythmia that you are having. An arrhythmia is a irregular heartbeat. This is what causes the issue that you are talking about.I recommend that you see your original prescribing physician and get the problem corrected. The other symptoms of palpitations(hearing your heart beat and of waking from sleep) can also be explained by this. This happens due to the anxiety effect of the medication.You can change the medication which will help with the asthma but not cause the side effects.

It is now close to 36 hours since cleaning and the hives seem to be getting worse. Do I need to go to the ER?","Doctor":"Its a kind of allergy caused by many kinds of foods, stings, external factors etc. Patient himself or herself is the best judge to find how it triggers.As per ayurveda, we have a clear principle that it is caused by Pitta and Capha vitiation. These are two basic humors of body. All the causes searched by modern science are basically Pitta and kapha vitiation.Nomenclature and principles apart, patients do not need to take drugs which cause side effects. Instead avoid known triggers and take Turmeric powder and Neem leaves (Azadirachta indica) plus sugar candy powder (if not diabetic). Mixture of these powders removes hives.One classic prepared Ayurvedic powder called HARIDRA KHAND alone is capable of treating hives. This is little smelly and mildly unpalatable but when one is cured without side effects, its soul soothing. Hundreds of my patients in three decades those passed felt a sigh of relief with this simple medicine after they wasted a lot of money on allergy tests and side effect causing injections and medicines.So my own patients believe in this medicine which is also having sustained effect because it corrects the balance of humors.Hope it helps.

Infections can also cause swelling to the face, such as orbital cellulitis or angioedema. Orbital cellulitis can be dangerous and so should be checked by a medical professional. At the same time it is important to rule out kidney disease which can cause swelling in the face as well as other areas of the body.

About fifteen months ago, I travelled to Sierra Leone in northwest Africa where I spent about seventeen days.  I faithfully took my malaria pills and was extremely careful about my drinking water and what I ate.  Several months after my return, I began having problems with dairy products (yogurt, milk, ice cream, etc) when I consumed more than maybe a third or half a cup within a twenty four hour period.  I suffer from stomach pains and some times diarrhea (neither of which is ever debilitating) after the consumption of such an amount of diary products.  Several relatives are lactose intolerant and my father has a diary allergy.  Should I be concerned about a correlation between my travel and this development (I had no problems like this before)?  Or is it more likely that this is simply me developing a lactose intolerance or diary allergy and that the timing was simply coincidential?","Doctor":"It seems simply coincidence of timings. However, if some stomach infection has been contracted, that's temporarily troubling and will go. I am happy that you took extra care of eating, water etc during your stay. So no worries.To my own patients, I suggest to take the following to correct the issues of dairy allergy:1. BAEL ( or BILV) pulp powder + Dried ginger powder + Isabgul husk ground in the ratio of 1:1:1 and take three times a day. In the morning and afternoon 1 tsp with buttermilk or yogurt. Mix well and eat it. At night may gulp 1 tsp with warm water. No side effects. If some irritation in gastric region occurs, simply reduce ratio of ginger powder or say, increase other two in the combo.2. KUTAJGHAN vati 2 bd with warm water.Start taking these for a week or so. May take for longer durations. No interaction. Even your relatives having lactose intolerance may have it too. Drink warm water ( boiled, cooled).Now how to get. In India its commonly available. Elsewhere make efforts to find these on net. Combos will not be available. May get separately and mix yourself. Ginger powder is found , may be in your kitchen too. That may be used. Isabgul husk may be found. Grind yourself.Hope it helps you too like it worked for thousands of my patients.

It starts very itchy but then it stops so I have not been using anything most of the times. When it becomes very itchy I have used Aristocort –A cream and it helps. Today it started the same on my legs and spread very quickly into rashes. Since it was very itchy and spreading quickly, I took antihistamine (desloratadine) and it went away very quickly. It happened after I had a sandwich with egg and some guava (fruit). I’m wondering if I am allergic to egg?!!! I don’t eat egg often so did not notice anything like this before. There was one case before though many years ago that I was eating eggs for breakfast for 4 -5 days in a row and started developing urticaria (hard and itchy so different from the ones I had now and they were only a few bums). So I stopped eating them for breakfast but the signs remained for a few days. I live in Bangkok for the last 2 ½ years so food cooked with eggs is quite common (like for instance fried rice) but I’m only experiencing this now. For your info, I have been having problems with gastritis in the last 2 months and after treatment I feel it is improving but still not quite cleared.

I started to have a 3 part cough (cough, cough, a little pause and then another cough). I live in northern NJ and trees are blooming everywhere. Since I am allergic to pollen, dust, mold, and ragweed, I thought that this was definitely the problem. On Thursday, it got a little worse, so I closed my windows and instead put on the A/C even though it was quite cool out. However, the cough stayed the same. I drank (and still am) lots of water and had a cough drop every other hour or two. Friday, I thought was a bit better since I went down to a 2 part cough, but the occasional cough would hurt my throat. Shockingly, I did not have a runny nose, headache, anything else, but the cough. However, I changed my mind on Saturday what I thought. In the morning, I went to help out at an outdoor fundraiser and there were trees everywhere. I knew this would be bad and went in and out consistently. Then, I started to get headaches and back aches, but no usual runny nose. Afterward, I went to my uncle's house and I felt much better. I thought that maybe the different trees had an effect on me, but as soon as we got in the car, it started up again. I took a cough medicine and slept, but it didn't do anything. I then saw I had a fever of 102. I took medicine and went back to sleep. This morning (Sunday), the fever was \\"gone\\" to me and I just had the cough again. When I took my temperature afterward, I was at 99 something. Now, I am at normal temperature, have a cough, now a slight runny nose, and every once in a while get a chill.After this too long story, is it allergies or something else? What should I do?","Doctor":"Surely it is allergic symptoms.

When I wipe the discharge is like light lotionm, sometimes white, and just before it was pale yellow. There is no itching/burning and the discharge is odorless.

My dentist recommended Zythromax (not the generic as I do better with the brand names). I have read lots of horror stories abut this drug, however, because of my history (allergies) I am given a suspension liquid and can take adjusted doses that seem to work well for me. The medication Erythromysin did work well but because of the mouth reaction I was told to stop it. I will be taking the suspension again and feel the drugs work well for me but I cannot take high does (history of anaphalyxis) . My doctors feels this will still be effective - would you agree? Also since I am almost 70, is this drug a concern regarding heart isues?","Doctor":"Erythromycin doesn't suit you. Still trying to continue is compulsion of doctors because of allergic reactions possibility with other drugs. Intestinal flora are bound to suffer and cause lose stools etc. Abscess in gums is a problem. You cannot prevent side effects of Erythromycin by default.To my own such patients, the best choice with me is Arimedadi or IRIMEDADI oil which is a herbal oil specially designed for mouth Ulcers, abscesses etc. Flavour may not be good, smell may not be good. But 100% efficacious, 100% safe. Pure herbal. Few ml. of it to be taken in mouth, swished here or there and gargles. Few minutes later spit it out. Keep mouth open. Let saliva come out. Even if it goes down the throat, its not harmful except bad feeling. In few days abscess will be cleaned, swelling gone, healing done. May do twice to thrice a day too.

This natural wonder is bacteriostatic, antiinflammatory, analgesic, healer, anti allergic and what not ! A classical preparation found all over India viz Haridra Khand is choicest here. It's not palatable and flavoured and you have to make extra efforts to find it.Can be used parallel to other drugs, no interaction, no side effects, totally safe n economic and result oriented. You have to take for quite a few weeks. Then if you do not find comfort, you have all the right to opt out from Naturals.Hope its sufficient guidance for your betterment."},{"Patient":"I used Osmoprep and had a severe alergic reaction.

If you have learned how to do shoulder exercises then continue with that it's could be effective . 5. Apply diclofenac based topical ointment which is more effective than paracetamol based.(available over the counter)6. Can take oral pain killers if pain is very severe. 7. Take Re-nerve Plus,as it is just a multivitamin supplement which is good for nerves (more useful in diabetic patients).If still pain is persisting then proper examination of shoulder joint is required to find the exact cause and if needed X-ray and MRI should be done. You can consult nearby doctor or orthopedician who can write X-ray and MRI of the shoulder after taking complete history and thoroughly clinical examination. Thanks and Regards,"},{"Patient":"I haven’t eaten much today. Before bed around 9 I had some gas and a small pain in my lower right abdomen. About 11:30pm I woke up from severe sharp pains in my lower right abdomen and couldn’t go back to sleep. Around 12 I tried to get up to walk around, I had pain when I tried getting up and walking. I still have bad sharp pains, pain when moving and some gas. Should I go to the ER or it out?","Doctor":"It's better to go to the ER and diagnose the condition. This may be the sign of appendicitis, which is nothing but inflammation of the appendix. If the symptoms persist,  it's better to seek medical attention immediately, because timely diagnosis and treatment are very important. Do not eat, drink, or use any pain remedies, antacids, laxatives, or heating pads, which can cause an inflamed appendix to rupture. If it's not appendicitis; a medical practitioner can diagnose and support you with the treatment. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"i have been having stomach pains for ages now asked my doctor but they are doing nothing about it. basically i took alot of imodium stupid i no but i was having servere pains to the point of crying on the toilet trying to do a bowel movment and thought the imodium would stop that. the doctor said i got bunged up and blocked and that finally went away after not having a bowel movement for 2 weeks after i was giving supositries and duckolax. ever since that cleared up about end of december, i have been having bad stomach pains, incositant bowel movments, pain before needing to go, and feeling sick when eating during a meal and after, aswell as the pain i feel constantly bloated and uncomfortable, i cant not go to the toilet as soon as i feel i need to go i get bad cramps in my stomach to the point in dumbling over so i have to go,also i had not problem with passing gas before all of this happend and now i do strugle a bit now. basically i feel likes it ruining my life and no one has any answers or helping me, everywhere i go is scary now cause i never to when it is going to happen and where the nearest toilet is, i just want to no what is wrong with me, for the pain to stop and for my stomach to go back to how it was before and if i need a bowel movment i can hold it for an hour should i need to and not be in agony. please please help me if you can.","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query .

When I was little, my family would go out for crab legs and then we would go get ice cream (I would order chocolate).

Then, when I was around 10, I went to a wedding where I ate some shrimp, and proceeded to throw up.  That was when we decided that I was allergic to shellfish.

For  those who get less frequent symptoms you could use salbutamol inhaler (ventolin, asthavent etc.) whenever required.

Can you avoid everything?Catch is try to enhance your immunity by natural means. Yes that's the only escape or one will end up trying unlimited anti allergics or avoiding hundreds of things in life. Allergy tests are only indicative. Practically can't cover full range of allergens.For banana, well it can be allergy. There is one antidote prescribed in Ayurveda. Chew and suck cardamomum seeds. It's not going to harm you. At the most it won't effect you. That's all. Your option to try anti allergic toxic drugs is always open.For common allergy management Ayurveda has mentioned a classical combo named 'Haridra Khand' which cures (CURES) a vast range of allergies without bad effects. It has more than 20 constituents of herbs n minerals.To my patients' convenience, where they can't find classical Ayurveda products abroad, I advise them to take Cap Neem, Cap Haridra and Sugarcandy powder if not diabetic. This is miniaturized Haridra Khand..not as effective but works.Hope it helps you. When there is solution, why to worry. All the parties are for mankind's help.

Then induce purgation by mild herbal powder Tarunikusumakar chooran. If not available take Triphala capsules 2 caps thrice day for two days. You may feel weakness but no problem.

The nerve compressed at its root while exiting from spinal cord, by various reasons, pains much and causes radiculopathy.Steroids are even used in the treatment of radiculopathy, though rarely.To overcome this, pain management by verbral support and physiotherapy should be adopted. If surgery is indicated it should be the last resort ( no 100% guarantee of cure).Some herbals may support both Asthma and neurological pain but switching should be done with determination to do long term treatment that may even be taken parallel to allopathy which doesn't counteract. Some reasonable gap is however, advised. Some easy yogic exercises, deep breathing ( Pranayam) exercise costs nothing but immensely useful . Try it now.  May seek help from any Ayurveda doctor on HCM or one near you.Every pathy is for the benefit of mankind. If one doesn't suit, support from other should be taken unhesitantly.Hope it helps you."},{"Patient":"Hi.  We just got a Yorkie poo dog who is supposed to be hypoallergenic.

Your solar graphia is actually a problem of photo-dermatitis for which you are getting allergic reaction in sunlight exposure.Our human skin is a multi-layered structure and it has tendency to wear and tear repeatedly on exposure to environmental factors.In certain situation when the exposure of the environmental factor is too high then the skin has the tendency to get red and itchy. These red areas appear as mild to moderate eruptions on exposed areas of body which are known as PMLE. simply saying sun burns.I would like to suggest you some more of remedies:1) SUN PROTECTION: by sun protection in form of proper covering and clothing. You must wear full sleeves clothes and gloves along with a hat every time you move out in sun. 2) Sunscreens: These do help but not as completely as covering body by clothes. Even then whenever the sunscreen is used- it should be used half an hour before going out as it requires 30 minutes to get activated.3) A LOT OF VITAMIN A and LYCOPENE IN DIET: Vitamin A plays a very important n role in sun protection. It along with certain antioxidants in our diet of fruits helps us best in reducing the damage of sun light. SO I suggest you to have lot vitamin A and lycopene in diet. You should eat all fruits as well papaya, tomatoes and beat root containing these things in plenty.4) You can also have the antioxidant capsule but follow a good diet as the main part.Your tendency of sun burn will decrease slowly and might take multiple of months to get better form internally, so have patience as well best of measure as suggested above.I hope these informations will help you.

I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. As I understand, your son is having asthma for long time. Exercise or exertions are known triggers of asthma symptoms in those who ave chronic asthma. And in some people exercise may be the only trigger for asthma symptoms. When asthmatic patients exercise, they inhale cold, dry air through the mouth; this causes sensitive airways of these people to spasm leading to breathing difficulty, cough, chest tightness and wheezing. This happens particularly when it's too cold, during pollen season and when air is polluted.When you give salbutamol (Ventolin) inhaler, it opens up the contracted airways and symptoms improve. One way to avoid this is use of salbutamol inhaler before doing the exercise. And if it happens regularly, daily use of preventive medicines like steroid inhalers or montelukast tablet is advisable.Hope I have answered your queries.

My throat is extreemly itchy, im weazing, im having difficulty breathing, and am afraid to take anymore albuterol. I have asthma and havent had sufficient health care to take care of it properly. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. If your wheezing is not improved by taking albuterol, my first suggstion would be to get examined by your doctor, as it suggests a possibility of severe exacerbation/severe symptoms of asthma.Your doctor would examined your chest with stethoscope and will determine how much severe your asthma symptoms are.2. In that case, he may prescribe you corticosteroids for a few days in addition to your inhalers.3. After improvement, your doctor will decide whether you need regular inhalers, depending upon how frequent and how severe your asthma is.4. Please avoid cold drinks and icy foods till you have such symptoms. Please take light diet, and plenty of warm fluids if possible.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you a very good recovery and the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards,"},{"Patient":"A circular rash like spot (quarter size) appeared a few days ago below the belt and I am scared that my first thought was an STD or something like that but I have not had sex with anyone.

I started using an anti fungal about 4 days ago but I cannot tell if it is getting better. There seems to be no change. What could this be? It appeared out of nowhere and I know that I have great hygiene and have no had contact with anything but clothing in that area.","Doctor":"The symptoms you had mentioned are may be due to some sort of fungal infection or contact dermatitis.

Please help . please help","Doctor":"Hello dear,The symptoms as mentioned in your post can be attributed to acute exacerbation of asthma, secondary to bacterial infection.Asthma is caused due to broncho-constriction (obstruction of smaller airway passages) which is indicative of Hyper-responsiveness of air passages.Management includes:1. Asthalin & Seroflo inhaler- provide symptomatic relief by causing broncho-dilation (dilating the smaller airway passages, relieving the obstruction & increasing airflow to lungs). So, you can use it whenever he is having an acute attack.2. Analgesic antipyretic preparation (like crocin or ibugesic syrup) to control fever.3. Antihistamine preparations like Allegra & Cough expectorant syrup for symptomatic relief.4. A course of antibiotics needs to be taken to manage secondary bacterial attack.5. Maintain adequate hydration & a healthy balance diet.6. Also make sure that your son is well protected from cold, dust & other allergens.If still there is no improvement, kindly consult his treating Pediatrician/ Pulmonologist for further evaluation and management.Wishing him a good health.Take care."},{"Patient":"I have a red pimple rash around my eyes that seems to go away but then seems to return again.

Though stye may not recur again n again.You may simply seek to take Haridra Khand - a pure herbal powder - though not palatable much - thrice day. It consists of turmeric, sugarcandy etc - no side effects.  4 weeks will be enough. No need to consult physically for this powder.Any kind of allergy or even auto immune allergy can be cured by it.

Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. As you have not mentioned your gender and age, my reply would be generalised one.If I were your doctor, after a general physical examination of yours including recording of your blood pressure in view of your head ace, I would advise you for a CBC, LFT, serum amylase and lipase, serum HCG (to rule out a pregnancy in case if female patients) an ultrasound of abdomen to rule out any intra abdominal pathology giving rise to such symptoms.

I just switched to being a vegan and I just moved into a new house (have allergies and asthma). Also, my pap smear came back abnormal but couldn t be treated since Im 20. Should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Do not be really concerned but take concrete observation to find out the cause of allergy yourself. Tests may not be exhaustive. You are the best judge for finding causes broadly and then explore further to pinpoint the reason.Anti allergic medicine in modern medical science can temporarily manage the allergy but cause of allergy is not cured.People who like to have Ayurveda may have advantage in getting cure of allergy. In Ayurveda its cured on the principle of Vata, Pitta, kafa vitiation. To my patients I would give Haridra Khand and Kanrkaryavaleh for 8-12 weeks to manage rashes and Asthma both. Immunity will also be created in long run. This is totally safe.Though it doesn't require close  supervision but may seek the advise of any Ayurveda doctor with these comments.Hope it helps you."},{"Patient":"49yo, 5'5\\", 223# female stung by yellow jacket on upper arm last summer.

Then, do not remember anything except throwing up several times and just wanting to sleep.  This happened very suddenly. Stomach very queasy (I never throw up) and threw up another time while driven home. I am very sensitive to bee stings.  If more than 3 stings, require pred dospak.  The site was still swollen 5 days later even taking Claritin qd and topical steroids. Question: Can the histamines of a bee sting interact with the alcohol in the wine or change the absorption of the wine to significantly enhance the effect?","Doctor":"No it is a myth. Sting may be independently more toxic or you might have reacted more sensitively in the then circumstances.Wine 3 glass may have independent effect on your stomach at that time. Banadryk also causes drowsiness and normally should be avoided with wine.Hope it clears your doubt."},{"Patient":"I have some kind of rash that has started on my hand that is now spread to my face, arm, foot and not trying to sound gross but butt hole and in my mouth also.

She had her gallbladder out at 15.  She is allergic to most trees, grasses, animals, etc.  She is now 20, and her symptoms have not lessened.  We also went to a homeopathic doctor.  He put her on 20 vitamins, but that is hard to swallow.  Her hair sample showed zinc levels off the chart.  She is currently on thyroid medicine.  We are seeking a doctor that believes she has an actual issue, such as autoimmune... Any ideas of what could be wrong?","Doctor":"I feel for your daughter.On the other hand you have done best in allopathic and homoeopathiy.I would suggest to my own patients to get Ayurveda treatment suooort by visiting an Ayurveda doctor who could find body type of the patient ( which probably is vat Pitt type) and select medicine accordingly.It would be a long term herbal therapy but no side effects. Totally safe. The worst would be that it would not effect much. Then you always have the choice to leave it.Initially no need to stop antu depressants and thyroid med she is taking currently.

I have a very sore area around my anus.The area is quite large spreading from the anus so not just a ring around the anus itself. It stings badly when I pee. I have had it on and off for about 3 months now and it lasts for several days. I do keep myself very clean as this helps the problem a little. I am a 56 year old post menopausal woman and have wondered if the problem could be hormone related. I never use scented soap and have not changed soap or soap powders recently.

However I can buy many medicines over the counter without prescription whilst on holiday in Turkey. Many thanks.

In that case apply Himalya's Pilex ointment and turmeric cream. It will only relieve.

Vicious cycle.To my own patients I would suggest Haridra Khand, Punarnava capsules and Manjishtha capsules. If she can't take Haridra Khand granules, Haridra capsules will be replaced. This is to initiate control over allergy, pains and urine related problems without side effects which is guessed. For complete discussion meet any Ayurveda doctor.Even at this age, patient will show signs of improvement safely by these herbals. No need to stop current medicines. Herbals will not counteract.

Surgery for sinusitis is a endoscopic surgery.In this surgery mainly we clear the sinuses and provide good ventilation for the sinuses.It's a day care procedure, patient can go home the same day. Once the surgery is done,, there are very less chances for sinusitis to recur.In my opinion if this is your first episode of sinusitis then you can wait and watch. If you are a chronic patient of sinusitis then I suggest you choose surgery.Hope this information will be helpful.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi. I think I may be about to have a severe asthma attack.

If not then normal avaleha with thick consistency is available everywhere) to be licked.Gargles with saline and little turmeric in warm water frequently. Haridra Khand is good for allergy, Laxmi Vilas Ras tab. is good for TLC, fever, cold.These are all safe during pregnancy.

I got dizzy during the first few min. into practice then I'd feel like vomitting, a little vomit did come up then the pain set in whenever I rested from the drills and  after I had a water break it sometimes came back stronger, it made it harder to breathe, the pain eased during practice but came back during or after I eat, when I  moved around even when I standed still and when I sit down sometimes Should I be worried?","Doctor":"Hi ! Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.From the history of pain, it looks to be of some inflammation inside abdomen. If I were your doctor, I would go for  blood tests like a CBC, ESR, LFT, serum amylase and lipase, and an ultrasound of whole abdomen to rule out any calculi disease in gall bladder and urinary tract. In addition, with the physical examination of the abdomen and the investigations, I would also try to rule out any chances of an appendicitis. Till then I would prescribe an anti spasmodic and a proton pump inhibitor drug for a symptomatic relief. Further management would depend on the result of the clinical assessment and reports of related investigations.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery.

Mum didnt go down for surgery until '4.45pm'. I was reunited with my mum at 9.10pm, no operation had been started as mum had another anaphylactic reaction!!

Thank you in advance.","Doctor":"Hi I have read all your queries and understand the concerns.If your mother had allergic or anaphylactic reaction to certain drugs then it must be disclosed to the doctor before going for operation.Yes you may be right that the operating surgeon must have to give pre-surgical medications but when if it is been clearly said my patient himself or relatives that the listed drugs are allergic.In spite of this,if surgeon had not operated and if your mother was not given medications or having said they will give during operation could be a case negligence (act of omission).Hope this will help you.Regards,"},{"Patient":"Hello.

Who cares about scientific sanctity of such herbs. Though, of late people are switching to Ayurveda successfully to find an answer. There are companies like Himalaya and others who contributed a lot to translate findings in modern terms.If I were your doctor, I would straightway advise you to try Haridra Khand and Kantkaryavaleh, Neem and Haridra, manjishtha capsules etc.to find side-effect-less solutions.

Vata, Pitta and Kapha manifest different symptoms when not normal either individually or combined with other/ others.To get through you have to take anti pitta, anti allergy herbal combo say Haridra khand .

That too without side effects.Hope this serves you well."},{"Patient":"I've been having pain in the upper right portion of my abdomen just under my rib cage. I've had blood tests done and an ultra sound to rule out gallstones however the pain is still there. My ER doctor recommended a HIDA scan and said it may have something to do with the placement of my gallbladder. I'm looking for another opinion on what it might be. I haven't had any fever, have had some nausea  and vomiting.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for the query.Before HIDA scan gastroscopy would be a good idea. Upper right abdominal pain along with nausea and vomiting can be also caused by peptic ulcer. Such pain does not radiate to the back (gallstones pain radiates to the back). It starts after a meal. It is usually dull and does not go away after painkillers.Pancreas inflammation can also give similar to gallstones pain. Stone in bile ducts can appear in the same way as well. I suggest you to consider gastroscopy if peptic ulcer seems possible.Hope this will help.Regards."},{"Patient":"about a week ago i went snowboarding for the first time. ever since then i have had diarrhea ever night. only at night. i also have had abdominal pain and a rash. the rash started out as only a couple bumps but has spread to my breast, groin, shin, butt. ive tried anti itch lotions but the dont work. the rash is really itchy and none of my symptoms have gone away. im not sure if they have anything to do with me snowboarding but thats just when they started to appear. do you know whats wrong with me?","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicThe itching rash may be due to an allergic reaction to some agent. This could be a food/drink/cream/soap/detergent/cloth etc.Since the symptoms are severe, you may want to consider allergy testing to find out the exact cause. This can be in the form of blood tests or skin prick testing.Diarrhea can also occur in allergic reactions though that may also be due to intolerance to a food or drink that you are using.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"ok im asthmatic and trying to quit smoking down to 2 to 4 a day sometimes not even that i use to smoke a pack a day 20 to 30 cigs a day . now i feel i weez on and off hitting on the inhaler every 4 to 6 hours and i get like this weird short of breath spells on and off why","Doctor":"Dear, First of all , i appreciate your effort to cut down on smoking. You will improve if you completely stop it. Well, you have not mentioned which inhaler you using.For patients like you, i recommend, Changing to long acting preparation(salmeterol) and steroid inhaler(beclomethasone and budecort) as asthma has bad and good days with change of season/other factors sometimes. If you feel no relief even after that, you may get chest xray done and oral steroids may be considered , if x ray comes normal for infection. Take Care"},{"Patient":"I have asthma and my doctor has tried several things and since I had bronchitis in the winter nothing seems to work . Right now I am on QVAR daily and ProAir and also albuterol with a nebulizer as needed. It works sometimes it other days I m using the albuterol too often. Is there anything that is considered a better combination. I also take an allergy pill daily","Doctor":"Hello dear,Asthma is caused due to broncho-constriction (obstruction of smaller airway passages) which is indicative of Hyper-responsiveness of air passages.Management includes:1. Asthalin & Seroflo inhaler/ QVAR and ProAir- provide symptomatic relief by causing broncho-dilation (dilating the smaller airway passages, relieving the obstruction & increasing airflow to lungs)So, you can use it whenever you are having an acute attack.2. Montelukast preparations- used as a maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of seasonal allergies & asthma.3. Antihistamine preparations like Allegra & Cough expectorant syrup for symptomatic relief.4. A course of antibiotics may be taken to manage secondary bacterial attack.5. Maintain adequate hydration & take a healthy balance diet.6. Also make sure that you are well protected from cold, dust & other allergens.So, the medications as prescribed by your treating Doctor are correct, kindly continue them as advised.Wishing you a good health.Take care."},{"Patient":"I have a question in regards to my asthmaI'm 26 y/o. I was diagnosed with asthma about four years ago. I developed asthma right after I stoped smoking. I have been with my current partner for about the same time, almost five years and he is a smoker. I have noticed that sometimes I get asthma episodes and/or attacks after I kiss him. Now, he does not smoke around me, and I never kiss him after he smokes. What are the chances that my asthma worsens by kissing him? What are the effects of his smoking in me? I'm very concerned because my asthma seems to worsen even if I take all my medication and follow up with every treatment.Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello ,Its been 4 years that you have been diagnosed with asthma, for which you taking meds already, we need to consider few points first:As you know that asthma needs a trigger , which could be anything for example smoke, pollen , hay , animal fur , dust etc when exposed to these it triggers a bronchospasm and an asthamatic attack occurs. So , as you said your partner smokes though not in front of you or around you , but he does smoke , that smoke is still present in his breath , his clothes and body and its enough to trigger an attack anytime . I hope you both are aware about the ill effects of passive smoking , they are almost equivalent to active smoking. I would advise to request your partner to think about quitting smoke coz its harmful for you and obviously for him in the long run.The medications that you take will also have a slower effect if smoking continues. I would also suggest you to book an appointment with your treating doctor and review your current medications maybe he/she might want to alter some to help you for a better control. I would also request you to keep a check of your Peak flow which is basically the maximum air that you breathe out in one breath and accordingly modify your inhaler doses. You should also indulge in some physical activities like brisk walking or jogging which will help maintain a good lung capacity, ask your doctor about breathing exercises , they also help in maintaining a good lung function.Prevention is always better than cure, so you both should meet your doctor and help your partner quit smoking which is beneficial for both . Asthma can be a very debilitating illness and you both are young , so you can check it at an early stage and keep good health. If you have further queries you can get back to me , am always here to help . take care keep healthy."},{"Patient":"My daughter has cerebral p. she has developed severe rashes in the last 2 to 3 weeks,on chest neck and faces with redness.

My eye movements were chaotic.I laid down and about a minute later it passed.  I got up and felt much better.  Was this an allergic reaction to the alcohol? I have never experienced this. I rarely ever drink and this was the first time having this particular wine cooler.","Doctor":"This doesn't seem to be allergic reaction of wine but could be vestibular disturbance (ear) or TIA.Better if it is checked by ENT specialist because vestibular problem may cause vertigo which you had most probably.

Asthma also causes difficulty in breathing, whistling sound from chest and cough sometimes. Since you have history of rib fracture with trivial trauma. Chest pain may be due to osteopenia(weak bones) of rib cage in your case. Only pain without other symptoms in your case may be pleuritic(lining covering lungs) which should go away in a week, or mascular.

History of chronic sinusitis. Sinus gets stuffy while sleeping - improved with use of breathe right strips.  Dry cough with intermittent metalic taste in mouth.  What could be going on?","Doctor":"hi,Welcome to health care magic,dry cough or metalic taste in mouth could be as a result of your chronic sinusitis problem.Sinusitis can be treated with medicines like antibiotics, decongestant, antihistamines and anti inflammatory drugs. If sinusitis does not reduce with conservative medicines ,and if sinusitis is recurring very frequently, may be 3 episodes in 6 months then we advise for surgery. And if the sinusitis is associated with nasal poylp, nasal mass, fungal sinusitis then also surgery is a must. Surgery for sinusitis is a endoscopic surgery. In this surgery mainly we clear the sinuses and provide good ventilation for the sinuses. We do have to cut the soft tissue, debride, drain and then clear the sinuses. It's a day care procedure, patient can go home the same day. Once the surgery is done,, there are very less chances for sinusitis to recur.In my opinion if this is your first episode of sinusitis then you can wait and watch. If you are a chronic patient of sinusitis then I suggest you choose surgery. Hope this information will be helpful. Regards"},{"Patient":"46 days ago i quit smoking.

I am managing the rough and peeling skin with moisturizer but the burning skin below lips is irritating","Doctor":"Hi there are many causes of lips burning ranging from mild to serious.Mostly it is not serious and do not pose a significant health risk.It might occur as the result minor trauma like biting your lip or burning it with hot food,contagious(herpes simplex virus),canker sores(known as aphthous ulcers).Treatment is mainly depend upon the underlying cause but symptomatic treatment is helpful as in most of the cases the cause remains unknown.You can see your family doctor or surgeon to rule out any other infective or malignant pathology although the chances are rare.Here, I am giving you some information which can be beneficial to you.1) Maintain good oral hygiene and avoid hot and spicy foods.2) Antiseptic mouth wash(chlorhexidine) for gargles for rapid healing and to prevent secondary infection.3) Topical analgesic gel like benzydamine which is also having a local anaesthetic effect.4) Take folic acid with vitamin b complex to promote healing.Hope this information is helpful but it would be advisable that you will see your doctor first and then ask for treatment.Thanks."},{"Patient":"For a few weeks now I keep smelling ammonia but nothing is around to put the smell off and no one else can smell it. I have developed allergies to our cats in the house everyday my eye swell, water, and itch along with my nose. My body for the past few weeks also feels like it's bruised everywhere for no reason or bruises showing up. I have also had a problem with headaches. Not sure if any of it is related but please help.","Doctor":"Hi,welcome to healthcare magic.I understand your concern.In my opinion bad body odour is of many types. Among them ammonia smell from body is routinely seen.Usually body depends on carbohydrates for major source of energy. When there are no enough carbohydrates body starts depending on proteins. The end product of this metabolism is ammonia. Ammonia usually gets excreted through urine but sometimes also come out through sweat and other body fluids leading to ammonia odour.It might be due to many causes like maintenance of poor hygiene, unhealthy diet and certain medical conditions.The following things might give some relief like:-1) Take high carbohydrate diet and 20% of proteins.2) Avoid some spices like cumin, garlic and take cinnamon.3) Avoid red meat and eggs.4) Take fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains which help in detoxification of body.5) Adequate fluids upto 2 to 3 litres per day.6) Bath twicely preferably with warm water and use antibacterial or deodorant soap.7) keep axillary and pubic hair to short length to avoid sweat accumulation.8) Use antiperspirants over underarms. And deodorant over body.If still the smell doesn't subside consult doctor to rule out conditions causing ammonia smell like diabetes, any fever, UTI (urinary tract infection) etc.Don't worry. It will subside.Thanks"},{"Patient":"I am lactose intolerate. Now when I eat some foods (not milk products) I hurt and burn in my vaginal area. This usually goes away after about a day.

His sinuses are now blocked (I've seen the xray) and surgery to clear out his sinuses has been recommended.  In Nov. he experienced what seem to be several \\"auras\\", but not seizures.  He saw his family practitioner who felt he was having atypical seizures and suggested he see an neurologist and get an EEG.  The neurologist wants him to get an MRI which he cannot afford, even though he has health insurance.  I'm wondering if his blocked sinuses could be preventing adequate oxygen to his brain and causing the auras.  Crazy?  He also sleeps poorly because he cannot breath.  Thanks for any insight you can offer.","Doctor":"hi,Welcome to health care magic,Blocked sinus or chronic sinustis very uncommonly produce seizures for which if we would go for MRI or EEG investigations,generally comes normal.Sinusitis can be treated with medicines like antibiotics, decongestant, antihistamines and anti inflammatory drugs. Surgery is not a must for everyone. But if sinusitis does not reduce with conservative medicines ,and if sinusitis is recurring very frequently, may be 3 episodes in 6 months then we advise for surgery. And if the sinusitis is associated with nasal poylp, nasal mass, fungal sinusitis then also surgery is a must. Surgery for sinusitis is a endoscopic surgery. In this surgery mainly we clear the sinuses and provide good ventilation for the sinuses. We do have to cut the soft tissue, debride, drain and then clear the sinuses. It's a day care procedure, patient can go home the same day. Once the surgery is done,, there are very less chances for sinusitis to recur. And yes the operated area is treated as problematic area until and otherwise you are undergoing second surgery. In my opinion if this is your first episode of sinusitis then you can wait and watch. If you are a chronic patient of sinusitis then I suggest you choose surgery. Hope this information will be helpful.

Although it requires a clinical examination of your abdomen, from your history it seems that possibly the pain could be due to a calculi in the common bile duct or there could be some kind of pancreatic inflammation.

If I were your doctor, after a physical examination of your abdomen I would advise you for an ultrasound of whole abdomen with special attention to the biliary tract and the pancreas. In addition I would also get done a few of the blood tests like a CBC, a serum amylase and lipase, an LFT and KFT to aid in the diagnosis and management.

It boosts up the immunity and prevents recurrent attacks of cough.Take a glass of water and boil some tulsi leaves in it. Add some honey to it and drink it three times in a day to get relief from cough.Saline water gargles are quite effective in the home treatment of coughing. Do gargle two or three times in a day to get instant relief from cough.Add cloves in water and boil it. Gargle with this water to get relief from coughing.Deep breathing , pranayam , Walking , Laughing  ,Kapalhati , Bharamari all stregthen your immunity Avoid processed foods carbs , sugar , fried ,fast foods , Tea , coffee , alcohol and smoking , stress and Constipation , sleeplessness will produce biochemical and metabolic conditions in your body that will decrease your immunity .So avoiding is definitely the first step in the right direction to detoxing the body, boosting the immune system , leaving you leading healthy disease free life  along with your present  treatment .The most important thing is to be aware of any side effects you experience, you are unhappy with them or are worried about the potential side effects , discuss them with your doctor.

It is a very benign condition that requires no need to worry. Usually hives (red spots with itching) also appear following heavy exercise, sweating, how water, etc. Some patients develop such symptoms only after warm water. 2. For above, I would suggest you to avoid hot water bath. If it is not avoidable, I would suggest you duration of hot water bath to reduce exposure to hot water. 3. Regular application of calamine lotion will help improve your skin and might reduce symptoms over time.4. Even despite above steps, should you develop itching and redness, I would suggest you to take antihistamine medications such as levocetirizine or cetirizine or fexofenadine on as-and-when-needed basis to control symptoms.5. Regarding the 2nd problem, painful testicles with redness, I would suggest you to consult your family doctor who will examine the genitalia directly to come to conclusion.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"i am 62 years old- female had several car accident in the last few years.

A simple supplimentaion of these vitamins will show marked improvement of your symptoms within a few days to weeks.                                                          wish you a speedy recovery...!!                                                                       thank you"},{"Patient":"Hello, i am wondering why the side of my lips are turning white. it is especially evident when i smile. i am 18 years old with asthma and skin asthma, i wonder if this is related in any way. by turning white, i mean it looks as though it has been stretch. thanks!","Doctor":"Hi, I understand your concerns. You are reporting to have asthma and skin asthma. I believe you are also taking oral medications like salbutamol or steroid oral spray. The long term use of such medications would make your oral mucosa turn white. Another cause might be oral thrush or even anemia. I advise to:- run a complete blood count to rule out anemia in order to treat it accordingly- culture oral swab to rule out candida overgrowth and if you need further treatment- keep a good oral hygiene Discuss it further with your doctor!Dr.Albana"},{"Patient":"My daughter will not stop coughing from perfume.

I feel like I can t breathe as if someone is suffocating me.It especially gets worst when I lay down or am asleep.

After a week of using it for only once a day, it got a lot better.After I stopped using the inhaler, the breathing difficulties returned again. This time, I went to a different doctor since the old one wasn t available anymore. The other doctor said I do not have asthma at all. I made many different tests and they all said I was fine. I didn t have anemia or heart problems and my blood pressure was just fine. The doctor just gave me a multivitamin for general health and said I need to come back for the X-Ray for my chest. What could be the real reason for it? It s getting really worst lately. I don t know what to do anymore. For some reason, my parents and doctor doesn t think i m asthematic, but I was diagnosed with it as a child and one time during my teenage years, and the other doctor disagrees about me having it in the first place. I don t have coughing or weezing, just shortness of breath. How come the inhaler made me feel better if it wasn t the case? Thanks, Allison.","Doctor":"Hello Allison,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and can understand your concern and confusion.I would like to know more about you like your age, nose symptoms (nose congestion, running nose, nose itching, etc), whether you are exposed to passive smoking/polluted environment, etc.However, at present, from your provided details, I would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. To confirm whether you have asthma or not, I would suggest you a test known as spirometry with post-bronchodilator reversibility. This will help to know your lung capacity as well as status of airways, whether they are obstructed, etc.2. Inhaler made you feel better suggests possibility of asthma. However, if you have not had such problems in past years, it could be a simple episode of bronchitis or infection which lasted long. (please note that some episodes can last for 4-6 weeks until complete recovery). If you have shortness of breath in past years (even childhood), it would more favor diagnosis of asthma.3. I would like to mention here that most of the patients with asthma have normal chest X-rays. Chest X-rays are not useful to diagnose or to rule out asthma. Of course, Chest X-rays are helpful to know if you have any other lung related conditions like pneumonia, etc.4. In general, I would also suggest you regular breathing exercises and avoidance of smokes/fumes/dusts to improve your lung capacity on long term basis. If you are routinely exposed to such environment, I would suggest you personal protection measures such as using face mask, etc.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you and will help you solve the confusions.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Does we have antidose for Steroid.actually ,my wife taken some ayurvedic/traditional drugs for cure of Asthma,after two months she found her total body getting swelling,so discontinued the medicine.upon enquiry the person who'd given those medicine admitted to used some steroids.though for Asthma she take the help of inhaler and under control but,her body is in swelling condition for last one month and feels severe pen while walking.plz advise the remedy.","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your wife's history and would like to make suggestions for her as follows:1. Side effects of steroids are more common if they are taken orally or injections. I would first think that she has had side effects due to oral steroids which were mixed in medicine.Common side effects of oral steroids are weight gain, diabetes, high blood pressure, gastritis, and many others...2. Many of the inhalers for asthma also contain steroids, but they are in inhaled form and they are minimally absorbed in blood. Hence they usually do not cause such side effects. Hence, they are much more safer for long term use as compared to oral steroids.3. As she has already had side effects, unfortunately there is no antidote. Side effects of oral steroids can decrease with time (a few months) after discontinuation. Though she will be able to use inhalers as per her doctor's advice.4. For better asthma management, I would suggest her to consult a pulmonologist or allergy-asthma specialist who will assess her symptoms in detail and will prescribe necessary treatment.5. I would also suggest her regular yoga & pranayama, regular exercise like walking which increases immunity and lung capacity over long time.6. I would also suggest her a healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals which will gradually improve her immunity over long time.7. Regarding pain while walking, it could be due to overweight, but it is important to know exactly which part of leg is aching to guide further. An orthopedic consultation may be helpful if pain is severe/of long duration.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to her.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish her the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, My bday party is Saturday, 11/6/10; however, 11/3/10, I had a severe allergic reaction to nuts.

Frustrating.","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicIf your asthma symptoms restart when you taper off oral steroids, it may mean that you need to increase your preventer medication (inhaled steroid  with or without longer acting dilator) medication and also may need to look at your triggers.If you can reduce your exposure to triggers that would be good.Your inhaler preventer medication may need to be altered.Long term for oral steroids would be consistent use for weeks on end.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"my stomach feels wiered  and it has been years to start with burning in stomach and chest, my stomach smells. my stomach always soare and so is my throat. it feels like there is a dead mouse in there. i spit out a very thick white stuff. soare stomach makes me dizzy sometimes","Doctor":"Hi welcome to hcmYour symptoms are suggestive of Reflux gastritis.Antacids like pantop 40 will be helpful.thankyou"},{"Patient":"I am currently challenging a food allergy (milk protein) by eliminating milk proteins in my diet.

The mystery is that her oxygen is 100 percent.","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your daughter's history and would like to make suggestions for her as follows:1. I would like to know more about her like her age, whether she has associated urticaria (hives, rash, itching, etc), whether any correlation with any foods or drugs, whether any digestion related complaints, whether she has any known allergies, whether she has any other disorders, etc.At present, from your provided details, I would suggest her as follows:2. I would first think of recurrent angioedema or anaphylaxis (more details are required to differentiate the two), common causes could be allergies (may be to foods, drugs or food additives like coloring agents, flavoring agents, etc) or non-allergic causes like intestinal parasites, physical causes like exposure to hot/cold temperature/water, etc etc. Detailed history is required to identify the cause.3. If she has anaphylaxis, I would suggest you to have a autoinjector epinephrine handy at home. This is more important as she has always had 8 intubations so far. Early administration of epinephrine can prevent more serious or fatal reaction.4. If she has recurrent angioedema, I usually prescribe my such patients daily antihistamines like cetirizine or levocetirizine for 4-6 weeks, which can prevent some episodes.5. For diagnosis, I usually suggest my patients investigations like CBC with ESR, CRP, stool and urine examination, serum total IgE, etc. To identify allergy, I would suggest specific testing for allergies. 6. I would like to mention here is that even if you give drug (like epinephrine) at home, it is necessary to take her to hospital immediately after development of such reaction. Please do not delay to call emergency services as both anaphylaxis and angioedema (when affects larynx) are dangerous conditions.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your daughter the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"My granddaughter is sixteen months old...she has numerous visits to PEDs...recently had gromets put in...is on meltonane...as she had woken on average every two hours since birth..diagnosed asthmatic...has been on steroids...at the moment just meltonane ..and. pain stop...she has a really bad smell from her head hair line particularly ..doesn t go after shampoo..bath...she seems to be upset easily at Times...during night sleep...very happy during day time hours...","Doctor":"Hello,Thank yo u for asking at HCM.I went through your daughter's history and would like to know more about her as follows:a.

If she requires frequent oral steroids, I would suggest her regular inhaled corticosteroids (via metered dose inhaler with spacer with face mask) which reduce frequency of episodes.2. If she has nose symptoms, I would also add antihistamine like levocetirizine & montelukast in her regular treatment.3. I would suggest her allergy testing for common inhaled and food allergens.4.

Acidity, heartburn, can cause or aggravate breathlessness or asthmatic symptoms. I would first think of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) for you.2. I usually suggest my such patients an antacid like pantoprazole (which is there in Ganaton total) for 4-6 weeks regularly.3. I would also suggest you to avoid hot and spicy foods, caffeinated beverages, alcohol and smoking.4. If you have symptoms of breathlessness apart from acidity, I would suggest you spirometry with post-bronchodilator reversibility testing which helps to know your lung capacity and also to know whether you have asthma or any other lung disorder.5. If stress is an important factor for you, I would also suggest you regular relaxation and meditation.6. I would also suggest you to minimize consumption of painkillers (if you have to take, paracetamol would be best in my opinion) which can aggravate acidity & GERD.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"My girlfriend just got these red flat specks on her neck last night.

The airways and lungs are treated, but little of the medicine gets into the rest of the body leading to maximum dilatation of bonchi and bronchioles and lesser side effects.The advantage of inhalers over other forms of asthma treatment are that they are causing instant relief (bronchodilatation) by relaxing the muscle in the airways.There are very good medicines like steroids, alpha and beta receptor adrenergic agonists, anticholinergics available in market in all formulations like inhalation as a MDI or rotahaler and injectables etc which can be effective within seconds even.Thanks."},{"Patient":"I AM SUFFERING FROM ASTHMA AND ABPA FROM LAST 10 YEARS.

I think that your reaction is most likely related to the medications (and very possibly either the antibiotic or the steroid), but it is difficult to tell without seeing it in person or knowing what the antibiotic was.

As she has fever and yellow phlegm, I would suggest her to start antibiotics like amoxycillin or azithromycin.2. As she is a known asthmatic and has experiencing tightness in chest, I would suggest her to use salbutamol inhaler as rescue inhaler, which will provide her relief.However, if her chest tightness or breathlessness does not improve with rescue inhaler, I would suggest you to get examined by a doctor immediately.3. Please continue regular medications for asthma, if any.4. If she has breathlessness any time, please contact your doctor immediately. Also, contact your doctor immediately if - fever does not respond to paracetamol, very high fever/rising fever, any another new symptom develops, etc.5. For relief of fever, I would suggest her to take paracetamol if temperature is more than 101 F.6. If she has additional nose symptoms like running nose, sneezing, nose congestion, etc, I would add levocetirizine + montelukast to above treatment.7. Please give her rest. Make sure she takes adequate amounts of liquids during day to maintain hydration.8.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.The possibility of a hernia would be less as the pain started from the upper abdomen initially and then went down to the groin. Also hernia would be diagnosed with a lump in the groin in addition to a personal physical examination. If I were your doctor, after a clinical assessment, I would advise you for an ultrasound of abdomen to rule out any other intra abdominal conditons like a gall stone disease, or a ureteric calculi. Till then, I would advise you for an anti spasmodic along with a proton pump inhibitor drug for a symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

As you have rash for more than 2 months, I would first think of \\"chronic urticaria\\". 2. There are many possible causes of chronic urticaria and I usually suggest my such patients investigations like complete blood counts, ESR, CRP, serum total IgE, urine and stool examination. I also add tests like serum SGPT, serum proteins, thyroid tests, serum ANA etc if patients detailed history suggests they could be useful.3. For treatment purpose, I usually suggest my such patients antihistamines like cetirizine or levocetirizine in morning and hydroxyzine (causes more sedation) before going to bed for 2-4 weeks, depending upon response.4. I would also suggest you regular application of calamine lotion over dry skin as well as rash regularly.5. Please do not scratch the itchy areas as scratching would aggravate itching.6. I would also suggest you vitamin supplementation like vitamin D which might help.7. Please avoid wearing tight-fitting or skin irritating clothes (like woolen clothes).

She has lost a lot of weight over this time. She suffers with anxiety & asthma. She vomits on a daily basis, has terrible headaches, small bruises everywhere & crys that she wants to be a normal teenager. I m worried beyond belief now.","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your daughter's history and would like to know more about her as follows:a. What is the amount of weight loss?b. What are her anxiety symptoms?c. What is the cause of her anxiety? Any particular stressful event? d. What is frequency of her asthma symptoms? What are the symptoms of her asthma? Wheezing, difficulty in breathing, fast breathing? Does she have hyprventilation (related to anxiety)?e. What are her nose symptoms - running nose, congestion, sneezing, etc?f. What is frequency of vomiting? Does she have any other digestive symptoms - constipation, stomach pain, etc?g. Has she been investigated previously? What were the previous investigations?Above details would help me to know about her and to make suggestions for her more specifically.At present, from your provided details, I would suggest you as follows:1. I would suggest her spirometry with post-bronchodilator reversibility testing. It will help to confirm diagnosis of asthma as well as to know her lung capacity. Sometimes, an adolescent can have asthma-like symptoms due to anxiety, which will be diagnosed with spirometry testing.2. Based on spirometry report, her doctor would also decide severity of her asthma. It will also help the doctor to decide whether she needs regular medications/inhalers or medications/inhalers for as-and-when-needed basis.3. I would also suggest her allergy testing for common inhaled allergens (house dust mites, molds, pollens, animal dander, insect proteins, etc) and common food allergens (milk, egg, peanut, tree nuts, wheat, soy, fish, shellfish, etc). This will help to know if she has allergies as well as to identify the substances causing allergies to her. 4. Weight loss is not a common feature of asthma-allergies. It could be due to poor appetite related to anxiety or other causes. Please get her weight regularly monitored by her doctor, so if weight loss is significant, other disorders could be thought about.5. I would suggest her regular use of antacids like ranitidine or omeprazole to reduce vomiting and gastritis symptoms.6. For intermittent bruises (At present, I assume they are hives, can be confirmed only by doctor after direct examination), I would suggest her to take antihistamines like cetirizine or levocetirizine and  application of calamine lotion.7. I would also suggest her a good multivitamin-multimineral supplement containing vitamin D, vitamin B complex (especially folic acid & vitamin B12), etc.8. Please try to identify her stressor and try to remove it, if possible. A psychologist consultation will help her to combat stress. Regular stress reduction strategies such relaxation and meditation may also help.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to her.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish her the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I have been allergic to fruits and nuts for over 20 years now.

This means that you need a much smaller dose than if you were to take the medicine as a tablet or liquid by mouth. The airways and lungs are treated, but little of the medicine gets into the rest of the body leading to lesser and lesser side effects.The advantage of inhalers over other forms are that they are causing instant relief (bronchodilatation) by relaxing the muscle in the airways.Thanks."},{"Patient":"My father is often suffering from cold and specially caught from last 2 yrs.....He consulted pulmonology and told probably initial state of asthma and under medication.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.All the precautions including birth control pills are not 100% fool proof in protection against a pregnancy. If I were your doctor, I would go for a serum HCG determination to rule this out and if need be would advise for an ultrasound as well. detecting pregnancy. Breasts tenderness no doubt could also be due to premenstrual congestion, but to rule out a pregnancy, urine pregnancy tests are not always 100% reliable.

These rashes are small little red dots, and they are really painful when I sweat. Typically takes about a week before I get well. I came across articles on miliaria and after seeing pictures and reading of symptoms, sounds exactly like what I have! So question is if miliaria can indeed by triggered by consuming alcohol? And if indeed so, can I conclude I am actually not allergic to alcohol, but merely that my skin was unable to handle the heat involved with drinking, or that my pores are clogged? I'd like to know that these rashes are limited to my skin and not a symptom of some bigger problems internal to the body. Lastly, please do advice if there is something I can do to prevent these rashes.. They are rally painful (like needles poking) when I sweat, which is really often here in hot and humid Singapore.Thanks for all your kind advice.Alex","Doctor":"Hi,This reactions is known as alcohol flush reaction.When we consume alcohol, it gets metabolised in body by liver enzymes into acetaldehyde and then into acetate.Alcohol causes vasodilatation of small blood vessels and capillaries and some times bursts this capillaries under skin leaving behind broken capillaries and red spots.Also,alcohol causes diuresis by suppressing vasopressin release from kidney leading to extra work to the kidney and by this water comes out in bladder leading to depletion of water in body leaves skin dry,rough and itchy.This all is direct effect of alcohol in body when consumed in excess,you can consider it as a allergy.The best way to cure allergy is avoidance of contact with allergen rather than taking antiallergic drugs like steroids or antihistamines.Some people(commonly Chinese,Japanese)have inability to convert this excess acetaldehtde into acetate leading to accumulation of this acetaldehyde into blood causing blood vessels to dilate more.And because of this,our skin turns red and slightly burning to touch till this substance clears from the blood by kidney.Best treatment is to curtail this alcohol consumptions.Thanks."},{"Patient":"I have bumps on the back of my tongue, after taking malaria pills and I cant swallow pills, so I chewed part of it up and then the taste was so nasty.

Please do not scratch the itchy areas as scratching would aggravate itching.5. As long as ESR is concerned, I would like to mention that ESR is very non-specific in general. There are so many possible causes of elevated ESR. Moreover, there is no specific treatment for elevated ESR, rather, treatment of the cause would normalize the ESR.So please do not worry about ESR at present. ESR can be elevated simply because of anemia (low hemoglobin levels) as well.6. For patients with hives for more than 6 weeks, I usually suggest my patients investigations like complete blood counts, ESR, CRP, thyroid functions, serum proteins, serum SGPT, serum total IgE levels, urine examination and stool examination.

Asthma is a dynamic disease, which tends to go under remission and may become symptomatic again in unpredictable way. The main cause of this unpredictability is because it is multifactorial, varies with environment, immunity, diet factors, stress levels, etc.2. If you think you are experiencing breathing problem while running, I would suggest you spirometry with post-exercise testing. This tests measures changes in lung capacity with exercise, especially running. If it is not available/possible, you can perform peak flowmetry before and after running, which will measure changes in peak flow rate after running.3. Also, known as exercise induced bronchospasm can be due to \\"mild\\" asthma, often unnoticed, so above spirometry will also help to identify the status of your asthma and your baseline lung capacity.4. If above testing does not suggest exercise induced bronchospasm, other possible causes of breathing problem during running can be anemia (low hemoglobin levels), other micronutrient deficiencies, nose obstruction, etc.5.

We have got her Milk allergy test done and the value has come out to be 11.5 whatever that means... Any suggestions from ur side would be helpful..Thanks","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your daughter's history and would like to make suggestions for her as follows:1. I would like to know exactly how she was tested for milk allergy. At present, I assume her specific IgE levels for milk proteins are 11.5.The fact that she develops rashes after taking milk products also supports the diagnosis of milk allergy.2. At present, avoidance of milk protein (all milk products) is the best treatment of milk allergy. Milk products include all the foods/drinks that contain milk proteins like milk, curd, butter, cheese, paneer, ghee, milk biscuits, ice creams, milk shakes, dairy products that contain milk, etc. 3. Although she is ok with ghee at present, it is possible that she may develop rashes if she takes large quantity of ghee. 4. In general, she should avoid all animal milks. Some parents try other animal milk (such as goat milk) as alternative, but 80-90% of milk allergic children react to that milk also. 5. It is advisable that she gets breast feeding up to at least 2 years of age, as breast feeding is very good for immunity. However, her mother should also avoid animal milk & animal milk products as particles of animal milk can pass through breast milk and can cause reactions to her.6. As milk is usually important source of vitamin D, calcium & vitamin A, I would suggest her to take these supplements until she is allergic to milk.7. I usually suggest my food allergy patients probiotics supplementation which helps to improve food allergy & atopic dermatitis earlier.8. Usually milk allergy is a self-limiting condition and most of the children outgrow with age. So I would suggest you to consult her allergist-immunologist every 6 month or yearly who may perform food challenge test to decide whether she is still allergic to milk. 80% of children are free from milk allergy by 5 years of age.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to her.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your daughter the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"dear doctor  i am having dry calf with breed thing problem i am getting by getting-cough-due-to-dust-elergy but i don't know when will it attack to me but really it is very much pain full i am getting non-stop  calf what i have to do there is no solution for my problem?","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicDry cough can due to different possible causes such as :(1) post nasal drip- this is the most common cause , this is treated with the use of topical steroid nasal sprays and oral antihistaminesAvoiding the source is also important(2)GERD- reflux is also a common cause(3)asthmaYour doctor can assess you and determine which is the likely cause for you.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...                                                                 Hi, my girlfriend has seasonal allergies, but a new symptom has appeared; she vomits everything she eats. She rarely vomits, so this is strange to her. She can't keep anything down. Is this normal with sinus and seasonal allergies?","Doctor":"Dear patient,  vomiting is not a typical sign of seasonal allergies. It could be that your girlfriend has a gastroenteritis (virus- or bacteriainfection, \\"stomach flu\\"). In that case it will get better within 2-3 days by itself. Another possibility is an early pregnancy. If the vomiting goes longer than 3 days, you should see your gp in town.

I have a six year old son who is having a severe reaction to omnicef. I told the doctor he was allergic to penicillian, and she put him on this medication over a week ago. 24 hours after the last dose, he suddenly broke out in hives. I took him to his doctor and she gave him prednizone and told me to keep him dosed with benedryl, and claritin. I have also given him several collidal oatmeal baths and kept him covered with calamine lotion. His hives are getting so much worse, they look like large donuts with white ridges and deep purple centers. The hives range from dime size to five inches across. He suddenly started complaining of stomach pain and began vomiting about thirty minutes ago. Should I take him into urgent care, or is this typical? He is not running a fever, and was drinking only water since dinner last night. His stomach is hurting, and he is very lethargic, more-so than I expect from benedryl. He is responsive, just out of it. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your son's history and would like to make suggestions for him as follows:1. It is possible to develop allergic reaction to antibiotics like penicillins, cephalosporins, or, scientifically, any drug. Unfortunately, it is usually very difficult who will develop allergic reaction to which drug. In case of your son, I think, it is possible that your son has developed reaction to omnicef.2. I would agree with treatment so far, steroid (Prednizone), antihistamine (Benadryl & Claritin) & local treatments like calamine lotion-oatmeal baths. I would like to make clear that benadryl is not only to keep him dosed, it is also a treatment of hives.3. As he is very lethargic, I would suggest you to take him into urgent care, as lethargy that is more than sedation could not be taken lightly. There are many possible causes of lethargy, from simply combined sedation of all antihistamines to more serious causes like dehydraion, etc.So it is important that he is examined by a doctor and then receive further treatment.So for my such patient, I would suggest to take him into urgent care to get examined by a doctor.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your son the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I've had a rash (more so hives) every day for the last 2 weeks.  It started with a bad sore throat and earache on September 28th.  Then, I had a lot of drainage and congestion.  I started taking Mucinex DM and then broke out in hives.  I thought the Mucinex might be causing the hives, so I stopped taking that.  Since the sore throat and earache was not going away, I went to my doctor last Monday.  He said I \\"might\\" have strep throat, but didn't test me for it.  He wrote Pharnygitis on my doctor's note for work and put me on an antibiotic (Amoxicillan 500 MG capsules to be taken 3 times a day).  I've been taking that, but the hives keep appearing every day.  Not sure if the hives are an allergic reaction to both medicines or if it is just a part of this viral infection.  I have to take Benedryl every night to get relief from the itching.  Do you know what else could be causing the hives?  I am broken out all over from scratching.  Didn't know if you knew of a specific virus going around that is causing hives?","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. As your hives started after taking Mucinex DM while having a sore throat with earache, I would think of either the infection itself or Mucinex DM.2. Although amoxycillin is a very common cause of hives, I would not think of amoxicillin you had hives even before taking amoxycillin.3. At this moment, it is difficult to find the exact cause of hives, it could be Mucinex DM, viral infection or strep infection. As you have already started amoxycillin, throat culture will not be helpful. There are many possible viruses causing such symptoms with hives, so I usually do not advise my such patients to go for testing for viruses, especially because there are no antiviral medicines for most of the viruses.4. Were I treating you, I would suggest you to complete the course of Amoxycillin and take an antihistamine like levocetirizine or cetirizine in morning and diphenhydramine (Bendadryl that you are already taking, may cause sedation) before going to bed at least for 7-10 days. If hives return after that, I would investigate my such patient for other causes of hives.5. I would also suggest you to apply calamine lotion over the itchy areas. Please do not scratch the itchy areas as scratching would aggravate itching.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you a very quick recovery and a very good health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"My 5 year old has had 2 asthmatic episodes (breathing distress and wheezing) and was hospitalized for 2 nights during 1 episode.  He also gets sick more often than my other 2 kids.  About 5 times a year, he gets a short lived stomach virus.  I'm wondering if adnoids may be a problem - I'm reading about mucopurulent drainage and wondering if his tonsils / adnoids should be removed.","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you son as follows:1. If he has 2 asthmatic episodes, I would not suggest him removal of adenoids or tonsils unless he has severe or persistent nose/sinus symptoms due to adenoids.Adenoids and tonsils have important immune function in a child's body and should be removed only when necessary.2. It is unusual to develop \\"stomach virus\\" around 5 times a year. I would like to confirm whether they are really due to infections or other causes like gastritis, food allergies, etc. I would suggest you to consult a gastroenterologist who may ask his stomach problem in detail, may examine him and may identify cause of repeated stomach problems with help of some investigations.3. For infrequent asthma symptoms, I would suggest my such patient to use \\"rescue\\" inhalers like salbutamol or levosalbutamol to be used on as-and-when-needed basis for wheezing or breathing difficulty symptoms.4. If he has continuous/frequent asthma symptoms, then only I would suggest him regular \\"preventer\\" inhalers.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your son the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I was coughing very hard because of a peanut I swallowed \\"went down the wrong pipe\\".

I would suggest you allergy testing for common air-borne allergens such as house dust mites, molds, pollens, insect proteins, pet dander, etc. This will help you identify the substances causing allergies to you as well as to know the measures to avoid them.2. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which will work on immune system to gradually improve allergy symptoms over a long period.3. In general, I would suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.4. I would suggest you to use inhaler as suggested by your doctor. (There are two types of inhalers, some are to be taken regularly and some are to be taken for symptom relief on as-and-when-needed basis).Inhalers do not affect immunity unless a very large dose is used for long duration (a few years), so please do not worry about it. Of course, it is important know that inhalers are very good to control the symptoms but they are not helping immunity too. So other measures to improve immunity should be taken simultaneously.5. For improving immunity through diet, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants are very important. Usually we get them from fresh green vegetables, fresh fruits and some other sources. Packed foods that contain preservatives/colors/flavors etc are not considered good, so as excess of fried foods, that do not have much of nutrition value.6. Some patients experience worsening of cold/asthma symptoms after taking cold foods like cold water, cold drinks, ice creams, etc. If it is true for you, I would suggest you to avoid them.7. Apart from diet, regular physical exercise, Yoga, breathing exercises including Pranayama and stress reduction including relaxation & meditation practices are very important to improve immunity. Yoga & Pranayama also help to improve lung capacity which helps asthma patients and may reduce requirements of inhalers with long term practice.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi i am vicky 23yrs old from jind. my whole body is itching from last 4 months it also get worst at night and small red rashes becomes if i scratch it and i have tried many types of medicines also ayurvedic but i still get no relief from this. but due to this my family also got effected please help me how to cure it.","Doctor":"Hello Vicky,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. As you have itching with rashes for last for months, I would first think of \\"chronic urticaria\\", which can be due to many possible causes.2. I usually suggest my such patients investigations like complete blood counts, blood sugar, serum SGPT, serum proteins, serum total IgE levels, thyroid testing, ESR, CRP, urine examination & stool investigations as basic investigations. These investigations may give clue towards cause of your problem.3. It is important to know more details about you like - any allergies, any digestive complaints, any use of medicines, nature of skin, factors aggravating and relieving itching, etc. These details would help better to identify possible cause and therefore to make suggestions more specifically.4. At present, I would suggest you antihistamine like cetirizine or levoceitirizine in morning and hydroxyzine (may cause sedation) in evening to control itching.5. I would also suggest you to regularly apply moisturizing lotion or cream, especially immediately after bathing to improve moisture content of the skin and reduce itching.6. Please avoid skin irritants like tight-fitting clothes, woolen clothes, extremes of temperatures, particular soaps/deodorants/cosmetics that may be aggravating itching.7. Usually loose-fitting cotton clothes are best for patients with itching in my opinion.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you a very quick recovery and the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I take Quetiapine at night for sleep.

So I would like to know more about you before suggesting investigations. Detailed information about you would guide me to think about some particular condition/s. 4.

I have been a runner for the past 4 years, but now when I run I have a difficult time breathing. Even 24 hours after running, it is difficult to breathe. What is going on with my lungs? Why was it easier to breathe when I was a smoker?","Doctor":"Hello,Allergies are known to increase in intensity overtime if exposure to the allergen continues. Smoking is also an irritant and decreases the capacity of the lung over time. If you quit smoking, it is always helpful. It not only prevents further damage to your lungs and heart but slowly they recover as well but the absolute amount of recovery depends on the amount of initial damage. In your case, in my opinion, you shouldn't link your cessation of smoking with breathlessness; it's always the opposite. Focusing back on your allergy, If I was your physician, I would like to get you examine the status of your lungs as well as test your allergies to make sure you haven't developed a new one or that the other ones are in check. It would also be advisable to start an anti-allergic like Desloratidine 10 mg daily and Montelukast sodium 10mg daily in this season, until pollen counts are below safe levels.I hope it's helpful.

Symptoms include systemic symptoms such as sweating and heat sense but also dyspepsia, nausea, and vomiting, flatulence, bloating, and diarrhea, Persistent pain in the upper right abdomen. Some individuals may benefit from diet modification, such as a reduced fat diet, following cholecystectomy since it may be more difficult for digestion of fatty foods. Postcholecystectomy syndrome treatment depends on the identified violations that led to it. Typically, the patient is recommended dietary restriction table with fatty foods, enzyme preparations, antispasmodics, sometimes  oral ursodeoxycholic acid can alleviate the condition.

One afternoon my throat was sore and the next morning I woke up with nose and throat almost totally shut and fever. I went to the doctor and she told me it was my tonsils and gave me antibiotics. In about 4 days the tonsils were back to normal again, but I still felt irritation in swallowing. Then I noticed something else.Looking at the mirror looking for signs of swollen tonsils, this time I found lots of red bumps on my tongue, smaller in the middle and front and bigger ones in the back of the tongue. I went to my doctor and she said that they are my tongues papillae and that it is rather strep or scarlet fever and in that case the throat infection might reappear in a couple of weeks or said that it could also be because I could not eat so much and in combination with the antibiotics it might be normal behavior of the tongue after having an infection in the mouth area. She told me to just mouthwash with chamomile and during the last 2 weeks it started slowly going away. It was not totally gone, but was much much better and I didn't feel it anymore in my throat, although I could still see the bumps. Then yesterday I felt again a sore throat, I woke up with great pain on my throat and difficulty on my breathing and my tongue was also kinda white/yellowish. I went to the doctor of course and she said she doesn't know what it can be, not giving me a certain answer. She run blood exams which will be ready in the morning and I also asked her to make a culture, which she couldn't so I went directly after her to an ENT doctor. The ENT said that she also doesn't know what it could be, said we should wait the blood exams results and gave me also a culture and the results of the culture will be ready on Friday.At the same time all this blocking on my throat from the swollen papillae makes my breathing difficult and it's like a have bronchitis or smith ar a slight asthma fit when I run or run up the stairs. I am going to get the first results tomorrow, I hope they will be fine.However I would really appreciate hearing a second opinion!

Such details would also help me to suggest possibility of some diagnosis as there are numerous causes for cough & wheezing.At present, from your given history, I would suggest you as follows:1. I usually prescribe my such patients salbutamol (inhaler, if not available, oral tablet will also work) for 5-7 days depending upon response.Please note that salbutamol can cause side effects such as increased heart rate, palpitation, tremors, etc. So it is very important to know about your medical history in detail. Please consult your doctor before taking salbutamol.2. If you have nose symptoms like nose congestion, sneezing, etc, I would also add an antihistamine like cetirizine or levocetirizine in your treatment.3. Warm saline gargles and saline nasal washes will also help you to improve earlier.4. Please take adequate amounts of liquids to maintain hydration.5. Please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.6. If you have had such episodes previously also, I would think of allergy and would suggest you allergy testing for common air-borne allergens such as house dust mite, molds, pollens, insect proteins, cockroach, etc.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you a very quick recovery and the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I am scared to take Zyrtec because I have to drive in 10 hours.

So, I have been using inhalers and some days I am a little better some days especially at work (office job) I get worse. Went to Allergist, no allergies.

That was yesterday. I used the new inhaler and it seems not to irritate my throat as much. However, I can hardly move my legs are so weak. Arms are stiff, neck is stiff and now my jaw is stiff. My doctor has not returned my call. I am getting worried. I am a very healthy person, energetic, not overweight, no high bp, no high cholesteral. I eat healthy and stay active and am rarely sick. Do you have any idea what is going on with me? I appreciate any help.","Doctor":"If you had emphysema earlier and also taking treatment for that,you can continue the treatment and also you were a chain smoker in the past.The most possible reason of your dry cough could be acute bronchitis and bronchiolitis.You have already undergone pulmonary function tests but you should also do complete blood count with X- ray chest.You will require high antibiotics (quinolones or cephalosporins or amoxyllin with clavulanic acid) for at least 7 to 10 days with antiallergic like steroids,antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers etc with saline nebulizers and steam inhalation.You must consult pulmonologist for detailed history and thoroughly check up of respiratory system and the treatment."},{"Patient":"Hi, My 5 year old kid has Asthma problem since child hood.We discovered when he is 8 months old who started with cold,Fever,wheezing and continuous cough.

Email address . YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. Please note that Apo-Salvent (Salbutamol) and Alvesco (Ciclesonide) are completely different types of inhalers.Salbutamol is to be used for treatment of symptoms of asthma such as wheezing, shortness of breath, etc. It is to be used for as-and-when-needed basis. It is not to be used for daily/regular use. It can be used multiple times a day. Ciclsonide is inhaled corticosteroid and it is used regularly to prevent asthma symptoms. Thus it has limited role while one already has started asthma symptoms. It is to be used regularly as suggested by your doctor.2. As you have shortness of breath, I would suggest you salbutamol inhaler as suggested by your doctor for symptom relief.3. Please note that you should continue ciclesonide inhaler is you use to take it daily. 4. If your symptoms re not relieved with repeated doses of salbutamol, I would suggest you to contact your doctor who may add some other medications.Hope above information will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I have a chronic running nose.

Hence, if you have known allergies, I would suggest you to take medicines regularly and consider allergen specific immunotherapy which is usually prescribed by qualified Allergists.2. For allergic rhinitis, I usually prescribe my such patients regular montelukast + levocetirizine.3. I would also suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.4. Regular steam inhalation and nasal saline washes will also help you in a longer run.5. If clogged nose does not improve with above medicine, I would suggest you intranasal corticosteroids for 7-14 days under guidance of a physician.6.

Urinalysis may be done to confirm it.So as first step , get your blood glucose level checked and get an urinalysis done.Is this answer helpful?"},{"Patient":"mY 7 YEAR OLD SLEPTED IN THE FLOOR BY OUR CHRISTMAS TREE. sPIDERS CAME OUT OF THE BOX FROM THE BASEMENT.

I was born with asthma, it would be mostly seasonal when I was younger.  I didn't have to treat it all the time, but when I had the occasional asthma attack it would be pretty serious, almost to the point of hospitalization.  As I grew older, the asthma became less and less apparent.  Up until about 2 months ago, I had not had any asthma symptoms for several years. Then, I did.  It went away for a week, so I thought it was ok.  Then, it came back, and it was very scary trying to breathe at night. I went to a doctor and they said I had pneumonia.  The antibiotics they gave me didn't seem very effective, and a few days later they also started me on a regiment of steroids.  The steroids helped, as did a nebulizer.  I was resting and feeling very ill for about a week and a half of that period, then I started to feel better.  Well, that only lasted a few days, and now for the past few days it has been getting worse again, necessitating several nebulizer treatments yesterday, and (after much effort and wheezing) coughing up mucus with a strange bittersweet taste (perhaps the albuterol from the inhaler and nebulizer?)I am concerned because the illness has already been exposed to a full cycle of both steroids and antibiotics, and yet it persists.  What might a doctor be able to do for me?  Does this require immediate medical attention, or might it subside?  Whooping cough is going around my area, and I do have a persistent cough.  Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,This could be acute bronchitis with your asthma as you are having persistent cough with expectoration.It can be diagnosed clinically but you must undergo routine blood investigation with sptum R/ M and C/S,chest x- ray to rule out any other pathology of lungs.You might require long course of antibiotics (amoxyllin with chavulanic acid or cephalosporins) with other supportive treatment like bronchodilators ( steroids,beta agonists,anticholinergics) inhalers or nebulizers with steam inhalation frequently.Consult pulmonologist immediately and take advise.Thanks."},{"Patient":"I have red spots on my chest that have spread and become more.

Do you know what this may be?","Doctor":"Hi,This red spots could be urticaria, eczema,tinea versicolor or corporis,psoriasis,shingles etc.If there is no itching then chances of fungal infection (tinea) would be less.It will require to get diagnosed first by doctors inspection.Treatment is mainly depend on the the diagnosis.So,better to consult dermatologist immediately rather than waiting as it is spreading continuously."},{"Patient":"I have a circular rash on the palm of my hand which is now on the sole of my foot.

If your skin is dry, I would suggest you regular application of moisturizing lotion or cream, especially immediately after bathing, twice daily. This will gradually reduce dryness of skin and therefore reduce itching.2. For symptom control of itching, you can use antihistamine like Zyrtec.3. For patients with hives, I usually suggest a good multivitamin-multimineral supplement, especially containing vitamin D, vitamin E, zinc, selenium, etc, which may improve immunity and skin.4. Please avoid extremes of temperatures, too tight-fitting clothes and skin irritants. Loose-fitting & comfortable cotton clothes are better in my opinion for patients with hives. Some patients may also benefit from avoidance of hot/spicy foods or avoidance of packed/canned foods containing preservatives/colors/flavors.5. Please have plenty of liquids during day to maintain hydration and improve metabolism.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"hello doctor . i m from bangladesh....my father has been suffering from chronic bronchial asthma for 4 years......he used prednisolone, ipraatopium, seretid accuhaler inhaler, salmeterol inhaler, euphyllin.he is 48 years old not diabetic, but hypertensive for 5 years.though using all drugs he  is also attackted by asthma everyday.then it is necessary to give 100% o2. now i want to consult you .......if u kindly advice me ....i will grateful to you...with regads- Masum Habib (student of MBBS course)","Doctor":"Hello Masum Habib,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your father's history and would like to make suggestions for him as follows:1. I would like to know in great detail what are his symptoms of asthma, how it was diagnosed, whether he is allergic, what are his nose/sinus symptoms, whether he is/was a smoker, his environment, etc etc.2. I would like to mention here that it is possible that he may need O2 for a severe attack. But it is unusual of asthma to require O2 too often. That's why I would suggest him spirometry with post-bronchodilator reversibility testing which measures his lung capacity, airway reversibility and response to bronchodilators. Spirometry will also help to identify whether he really has asthma, or COPD or so called asthma with irreversible obstruction or similar disorders. Spirometry will also help to choose appropriate medications and inhalers for him.3. For him, I would also suggest Chest X-ray as it is unusual for a normal asthmatic patient to require O2 too often. 4. I would like to know about his antihypertensives. Beta-blocker group of antihypertensives can aggravate asthma or bronchoconstriction. So if he is taking beta-blocker group of drugs, I would suggest to consult his physician to look for possibility of other group of drugs.5. Regarding treatment, I would suggest him regular combined inhaled corticosteroids + salmeterol or formoterol. As he is already taking Seretid and not controlled, I would suggest him to increase dosing. 6. If he is allergic, I would add montelukast in his regular treatment. If he has allergic rhinitis also, I would add montelukast + levocetirizine in his regular treatment.7. Please continue all drugs as prescribed by his physician. Asthma needs regular treatment. Fr in-between attacks, I would suggest him to use salbutamol or combined salbutamol-ipratropium inhaler.8. I usually prescribe ipratropium for severe asthma attacks. For regular preventer treatment, tiotropium is preferred over ipratropium. 9. If he is allergic, I would suggest him allergy testing for common inhaled allergens such as house dust mites, molds, pollens, insect proteins, pet dander, etc. This will help you to know identify the substances he may be allergic to and also to know the measures to avoid them. However, looking at severity of asthma, allergy testing would not be my first priority.10. In general, please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.11. Regular breathing exercises including Yoga & Pranayama and a healthy diet rich in vitamins, minerals & antioxidants will also help him in a long run by improving his lung capacity and immunity respectively.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to him.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your father the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I get allergic cold everytime there is a change of climate.

I would suggest you skin prick tests for common aero-allergens like house dust mites, molds, regional pollens, insect proteins, animal dander, etc. Usually qualified Allergists perform such skin prick tests.2. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to gradually improve allergy symptoms over a long period and reduce recurrences.3. For symptom control, I would suggest you to take combination of montelukast + levocetirizine. If you have wheezing/bronchial symptoms, I would also add salbutamol to your treatment.4. Regular nasal saline washes, steam inhalation and warm saline gargles will also help you in a long run.5. In general, please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.6. If stress is an important factor for you, regular relaxation and meditation will also help by reducing stress.

I have used inhalers before but very very sparingly and have only have them with a prescription after severe sinus infections or bronchitis.  Does the very sporadic use of an inhaler mean that i actually have asthma?","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. Inhalers are usually prescribed for asthma/bronchitis. Sinus infections tend to aggravate asthma but inhalers are not useful in sinus infections.So I assume you were prescribed inhalers for asthma/bronchitis symptoms that were aggravated by sinusitis.2. Asthma/bronchisitis symptoms can change with age, environment, etc. So if you have used inhalers sporadically in past, I would like to know at what age and how frequently.3. For occupational purposes, asthma is best diagnosed/ruled out by a test known as spirometry. Hence, I would suggest you spirometry with post-bronchodilator and post-exercise reversibility testing.

Allergen specific immunotherapy is usually prescribed by Allergists-Immunologists.2) Will it affect other parts of body:As you have wheezing, nose & eye symptoms, you are allergic from air-borne allergens. Aeroallergens usually cause allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic asthma etc. It important that they are treated promptly. For example, if allergy rhinitis is not treated promptly, it could lead to long standing nose obstruction and can affect hearing, sinuses, etc.Rarely aeroallergens can cause dermatitis or urticaria.However, if you are allergic, it is possible that you develop allergies to other allergens with progression of time. Allergen specific immunotherapy can halt this process of progression of allergy.3) Not all, but 40-60% of children of allergic parents can have allergies.

From your given details, I would agree that you could have allergies.2. I would suggest you allergy testing for common air-borne allergens such as house dust mites, molds, regional pollens, insect proteins & animal dander (if you have a pet). This will help you identify the substances causing allergies to you as well as to know the measures to avoid them.3. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may also prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which improves immune system to gradually improve allergy symptoms over a long period.4. In general, please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.5. For control of symptoms, I would agree with your doctor and will suggest you regular montelukast + levocetirizine (Montair-LC).6. Common side effects of montelukast are stomach upset, nausea, headache, etc and those of levocetirizine are sedation, drowsiness, etc. If you are not experiencing any of these side effects, it is usually safe to take for long duration.7. Regular steam inhalation will also help you in a long run.8. Regular physical exercises including breathing exercises (Yoga-Pranayama) as well as nutritious diet rich in vitamins & minerals will also help you in a long run by improving your lung capacity and immunity respectively.9. If stress is a significant factor in your life, I would also suggest you regular relaxation & meditation as stress can worsen allergies & asthma.10. I would like to mention here that allergies-asthma are dynamic and unpredictable diseases, so please do not assume that you have to take drugs for life time at present. Instead, with proper understanding of the disease, please try to improve your immunity, health and lung capacity so that gradually your drug requirements would decrease.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi Dr. Grief.

An U/S on  Feb. 3/14 shows 9mm left of my appendix and I am wondering if I still need surgery to remove that piece.  I have not got my energy back, but every day is a little better, but I am so tired after 8pm at night I cannot keep my eyes open.  I was supposed to see the surgeon Friday, Feb. 14th but he cancelled due to an emergency.  I have had to take a considerable time off of work and lost another day Friday, so I am trying to decide if maybe I should just forego the surgery, however this tiredness makes me wonder if I am still recovering from the appendicitis or does this indicate that I should have it removed, or is this common to still be so tired.  Prior to this happening, I never went to bed until 12-1 in the am and 5 hours sleep was plenty for me.  I work as a lab tech in a busy Family Health Team for the last 7 years, full time on the go, so this is very out of the norm for me.  Any thoughts?

She has a twin sister who does not have this problem.  I thought that young children do not sweat so much that you could smell body order under their arms.  Please advise.  Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,this is focal excessive sweating commonly seen in young children and teenagers.In healthy child, causes are excess physical activities, anxiety, spicy diet,too much cold water,excessive heat or might be genetic ( no comparison with twin child)Generally sweating occurs in body to lower down the surface temperature and to cool down skin.Treatment, you can apply antiperspirants( aluminium chloride) or topical anticholinergics which will reduce sweating to some extent.This kind of problem subsides usually as with the growing age.No need to worry."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, my baby (1 yr and 2 mnths) old is having heat boils on the forehead and doctor has advised Clavam dry syrup. He has been given the syrup for the past two days and the boils is getting healed very slowly. However he has started getting the boils in other parts of the face. Is this a side effect for the syrup? If yes, is there anyalternative medicine that can be given?","Doctor":"Hi,Boil can occur anywhere in the body despite treatment.Your baby should be given antibiotics in syrup formulations like cefixime from cephalosporins or syrup clavum is also good but it might cause diarrhea in newborns, so if possible you can change the antibiotics but only after pediatrician consultation. I would suggest if clavum is working on old boils and they are getting cured and if baby has not diarrhea then you can continue with clavum.Appearance of other boil has nothing to do with antibiotics."},{"Patient":"Hello I  have tiny red pin point spots but they are not under the skin they seem with a little textured.

Is this serious? Can a Dermatologist burn them on give me something to fade them away?","Doctor":"Hi,Red spots on abdomen could be due to contact dermatitis, eczema,impetigo, psoriasis or lupus erythimatous( autoimmune disease).Treatment mainly dependent upon the underlying cause or disease.The important thing is to diagnose and for that you need to see dermatologist as this is type diseases must be seen by the naked eye of doctor.

First of all, I would like to know whether his difficulty in breathing is due to nose obstruction or constrictions of bronchial tubes. As the treatment differs for both.2. as he is snoring also, I would first think of nose/upper airway obstruction. I usually prescribe my such patients regular montelukast + levocetirizine till nose symptoms improve, usually for 2-4 weeks.3. If he has shortness of breath, whistling sound from chest (wheezing), etc, I would suggest him sabutamol/levosalbutamol inhaler on as-and-when-needed basis.4. Regular steam inhalation will help him for improving nose symptoms.5. For diagnosis of allergy, I would suggest him allergy skin testing for common air-borne allergens such as house dust mites, molds, pollens, insect proteins, animal dander, etc.This will help you identify the substances causing allergies to him as well as to know the measures to avoid them.6. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may also prescribe him allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to gradually improve allergy symptoms.7. In general, I would suggest him to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.8. Regular physical exercise including Yoga, Pranayama and breathing exercises as well as nutritious diet rich in vitamins & minerals will also help in a long run by improving his lung capacity and immunity respectively.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to him.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your son the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I have had mild asthma for 20+ yrs until the past couple years I haven t used medication other than an allergy tablet. The past 2 yrs I have tried inhaled steroids (lower resp. Infection occurs w/in 7-14 days each time so my Dr told me not to use them anymore ) I just moved out of state & the doctors here just want me on steroids with no other options. Using the albuterol inhaler has my blood pressure way up, I still feel short of breathe, My O2 levels are 100%, chest xrays clear. Tight heavy feeling in my chest (cardiac work up was clear) scratchy irritated feeling when I breathe, no mucus, dry cough. Hot steam from the shower helps a lot but I can t live in there so is there something else I can try.","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. As you are not comfortable with inhaled corticosteroids, I would first suggest you regular montelukast. If you have nose symptoms also, I would prescribe my such patients levocetirizine + montelukast.2. I would also suggest you spirometry testing with post-bronchodilator reversibility, which helps to know your lung capacity, condition of airways and type of obstructions you could have. It also helps to decide whether you need regular medications/inhalers or using Albuterol inhaler on as-and-when-needed basis would be enough.3. If you require regular medications and you don't want to use inhaled corticosteroids, other options (apart from montelukast) are inhaled tiotropium bromide, oral theophylline, etc. However, they can be less effective than inhaled corticosteroids and/or can have some side effects. Also, they are prescription drugs and you need to discuss pros and cons with your doctor in detail.4. As you have dry cough also, regular warm saline gargles will help. If you have nose symptoms also, I would also suggest you regular steam inhalation, which would improve your airways in a long run.5. In general, please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.6.

I would also suggest you to apply moisturizing lotion/cream over itchy/dry areas regularly to reduce itching.4. Please avoid sudden, extreme temperature changes.5. I usually also suggest my such patients a good vitamin-mineral supplement that includes vitamin D, vitamin E, zinc, selenium, etc which may help to improve immunity and skin.6.
