The center of the fifth sphere must obviously be at the center of the tetrahedron.

Find the greatest natural number that, for each its representation as a sum of positive integers, there exists a fleet such that the summands are exactly the numbers of squares contained in individual ships.","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the greatest natural number ( n ) such that for any partition of ( n ) into positive integers, there exists a fleet of ships on a ( 10 times 10 ) grid where the summands are exactly the numbers of squares contained in individual ships. The ships must be vertex-disjoint.2. Initial Observation:   The grid is ( 10 times 10 ), which contains ( 100 ) unit squares. We need to ensure that the ships are vertex-disjoint, meaning no two ships can share a common vertex.3. Partitioning the Grid:   Consider partitioning the ( 10 times 10 ) grid into ( 2 times 2 ) squares. Each ( 2 times 2 ) square contains 4 unit squares. There are ( frac{100}{4} = 25 ) such ( 2 times 2 ) squares in the grid.4. Maximum Number of Ships:   If we place one ship in each ( 2 times 2 ) square, we can have 25 ships, each occupying 4 unit squares. This configuration ensures that no two ships share a common vertex.5. Verification for ( n = 25 ):   For ( n = 25 ), we can represent ( 25 ) as a sum of 25 ones: ( 1 + 1 + cdots + 1 = 25 ). This means we need 25 ships, each containing 1 unit square. However, this is not possible because placing 25 ships, each containing 1 unit square, would require 25 unit squares, and ensuring they are vertex-disjoint is not feasible in a ( 10 times 10 ) grid.6. Verification for ( n = 24 ):   For ( n = 24 ), we can represent ( 24 ) as a sum of 24 ones: ( 1 + 1 + cdots + 1 = 24 ). This means we need 24 ships, each containing 1 unit square. This is also not feasible for the same reason as above.7. Verification for ( n = 25 ) with Different Partitions:   For ( n = 25 ), consider different partitions such as ( 4 + 4 + cdots + 4 + 1 = 25 ). We can place six ( 2 times 2 ) ships and one ship containing 1 unit square. This configuration is feasible and ensures that the ships are vertex-disjoint.8. Generalization:   For any ( 2k times 2m ) grid, the maximum number of vertex-disjoint ships is ( km ). For a ( 10 times 10 ) grid, ( k = 5 ) and ( m = 5 ), so the maximum number is ( 5 times 5 = 25 ).Conclusion:The greatest natural number ( n ) such that for any partition of ( n ) into positive integers, there exists a fleet of ships on a ( 10 times 10 ) grid where the summands are exactly the numbers of squares contained in individual ships, is ( 25 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ 25 } )."},{"problem":"Example 14.

Let ( p, q, r ) be distinct real numbers that satisfy the given system of equations:   [   q = p(4 - p), quad r = q(4 - q), quad p = r(4 - r).   ]   We introduce new variables ( a, b, c ) such that:   [   a = p - 2, quad b = q - 2, quad c = r - 2.   ]   This transforms the system into:   [   b = f(a), quad c = f(b), quad a = f(c),   ]   where ( f(x) = 2 - x^2 ).2. We need to solve the equation ( a = f(f(f(a))) ). Substituting ( f(x) = 2 - x^2 ), we get:   [   f(f(f(a))) = 2 - (2 - (2 - a^2)^2)^2.   ]   Therefore, we need to solve:   [   f(f(f(a))) - a = 0.   ]3. To find the roots of this equation, we note that ( f(a) = a ) gives the fixed points of ( f ):   [   2 - a^2 = a implies a^2 + a - 2 = 0 implies (a - 1)(a + 2) = 0.   ]   Thus, ( a = 1 ) or ( a = -2 ).4. We now consider the polynomial ( f(f(f(a))) - a ):   [   f(f(f(a))) - a = 2 - (2 - (2 - a^2)^2)^2 - a.   ]   This polynomial is of degree 8. The roots of this polynomial include ( a = 1 ) and ( a = -2 ). The sum of the roots of a polynomial ( P(x) = 0 ) of degree ( n ) with leading coefficient 1 is given by Vieta's formulas as the negative of the coefficient of ( x^{n-1} ) divided by the leading coefficient. Here, the sum of the roots of ( f(f(f(a))) - a = 0 ) is zero because the coefficient of ( a^7 ) is zero.5. The polynomial ( f(f(f(a))) - a ) factors as:   [   (a - 1)(a + 2)(a^3 - 3a - 1)(a^3 - a^2 - 2a + 1) = 0.   ]   The roots of ( a^3 - 3a - 1 = 0 ) and ( a^3 - a^2 - 2a + 1 = 0 ) are the remaining roots.6. We need to verify that the roots of ( a^3 - 3a - 1 = 0 ) and ( a^3 - a^2 - 2a + 1 = 0 ) form triples ( {a_1, f(a_1), f(f(a_1))} ) and ( {a_2, f(a_2), f(f(a_2))} ) respectively. The sum of the roots of each cubic polynomial is zero by Vieta's formulas.7. Therefore, the sum of the roots of ( f(f(f(a))) - a = 0 ) is zero, and the sum of the roots of the two cubic polynomials is zero. The total sum of ( a, b, c ) is zero.8. Finally, we need to find ( p + q + r ):   [   p + q + r = (a + 2) + (b + 2) + (c + 2) = a + b + c + 6.   ]   Since ( a + b + c = 0 ), we have:   [   p + q + r = 6.   ]The final answer is (boxed{6})."},{"problem":"11.

By the central angle theorem, we have widehat{D O B}=2 widehat{D A B}=120^{circ}, and by the Law of Cosines, it follows that B D^{2}=R^{2}(2-2 cos (widehat{D O B})); since cos (widehat{D O B})=-1 / 2, we deduce that 9=B D^{2}=3 R^{2}, hence R=sqrt{3}.Furthermore, using the power of point M with respect to mathcal{C}, we get: M A cdot M C=M B cdot M D=2, while M A+M C=2 R=2 sqrt{3}. Since widehat{B C D}>widehat{D A B}, we know that M A>M C, from which we deduce that M A=sqrt{3}+1 and M C=sqrt{3}-1.

The answer is 373.Let's find all the numbers that satisfy the conditions of the text.First, we notice that if we have found all acceptable numbers of n digits, then an acceptable number of n+1 digits must necessarily contain one of the numbers of n digits. In particular, if we discover that there is no number of k digits, then there will be no acceptable number with more than k digits.The acceptable numbers of one digit are the one-digit primes, i.e., 2, 3, 5, and 7. We note, however, that the digits 2 and 5 can only be at the beginning of an acceptable number (otherwise, the number would have a subsequence divisible by 2 or 5, respectively).The acceptable numbers of two digits are therefore 23, 37, 53, and 73.Now let's look at the numbers of three digits. None can end in 23 or 53. Then 237, 537, 273, and 573 are not acceptable as they are multiples of 3. No number can start with the same pair of digits, otherwise it would have a subsequence that is a multiple of 11 (for example, in 773, the subsequence 77 is a multiple of 11). The only ones left to check are 373, which turns out to be prime (and therefore acceptable), and 737, which is a multiple of 11.Now let's see if there can be numbers of four digits.

The second contains a subsequence that is a multiple of 11, and the last one is a multiple of 101.

We observe thatfrac{mathrm{BF}}{mathrm{BC}}=frac{|mathrm{ABF}|}{|mathrm{ABC}|}=frac{|mathrm{ABO}|}{|mathrm{ABC}|}because triangles A B F and A B C with bases B F and B C have the same height, and A B O and A B F have the same base A B and two parallel heights of the same length (since, if mathrm{O}^{prime}, mathrm{F}^{prime} are the feet of the heights, mathrm{OO}^{prime} mathrm{F}^{prime} mathrm{F} is a rectangle).We deduce thatfrac{B F}{B C}+frac{A E}{A B}+frac{C D}{A C}=frac{|A B O|}{|A B C|}+frac{|A O C|}{|A B C|}+frac{|O C B|}{|A B C|}=1 .Second Solution:Here we will use a slightly more general result than Thales' theorem: the fact that two triangles with the same angles have proportional side lengths (such triangles are called similar).Let F^{prime} be the intersection of [A C] and (OF).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_93e83a8cba80c1bd2fe8g-2.jpg?height=352&width=567&top_left_y=366&top_left_x=779)For example, triangles mathrm{ABC} and mathrm{F}^{prime} mathrm{CF} in the exercise have parallel sides, so they have the same angles and are similar, hence frac{B F}{B C}=frac{A F^{prime}}{A C}. (But this can also be shown using Thales' theorem.)However, triangles A B C and F^{prime} O D are also similar, so frac{F^{prime} D}{A C}=frac{F^{prime} O}{A B}.Moreover, A F O^{prime} E is a parallelogram, so mathrm{F}^{prime} mathrm{O}=A E, and finally:frac{B F}{B C}+frac{A E}{A B}+frac{C D}{A C}=frac{A F^{prime}}{A C}+frac{F^{prime} D}{A C}+frac{C D}{A C}=1Exercise 3. Consider a number N that can be written in the form 30 x 070 y 03, where x and y are digits between 0 and 9. For which values of (mathrm{x}, mathrm{y}) is the integer N divisible by 37?Solution to Exercise 3 We can write N=300070003+1000000 x+100 y. Since 100=37 times 3-11 and 1000=37 times 30-110=37 times 27+1, we have 1000000=1000^{2}=37 times (37 times 27^{2}+2 times 27)+1 (by double distributivity).Since 37 divides N, 37 also divides 300070003+x-11 y. By performing the Euclidean division of 300070003 by 37, we find that 300070003=37 times 8110000+3.In short, 37 divides N if and only if it divides 3+x-11 y, which is an integer between 12 (if x=9 and y=0) and -96 (if x=0 and y=9). Therefore, there are three possibilities:- We have 3+x-11 y=0, i.e., y=1 and x=8;- We have 3+x-11 y=-37, so y=4 and x=4;- We have 3+x-11 y=-74, so y=7 and x=0."},{"problem":"A line passing through the focus of the parabola x^{2}=4y and inclined at an angle of frac{3π}{4} cuts a chord of length ____ on the parabola.","solution":"To solve the problem step-by-step, we start by identifying the focus of the parabola x^{2}=4y. The focus of a parabola in the form x^{2}=4ay is at (0,a), so for our parabola, the focus is at (0,1).Next, we need to find the equation of the line passing through this focus and inclined at an angle of frac{3pi}{4}. The slope of a line inclined at an angle theta is given by tan(theta). Since tanleft(frac{3pi}{4}right) = -1, the equation of the line can be written as y = mx + c, where m = -1 and it passes through (0,1). Substituting these values, we get y = -x + 1.Now, we have the system of equations:[left{begin{array}{l}x^{2} = 4y y = -x + 1end{array}right.]Substituting y from the second equation into the first gives us x^{2} = 4(-x + 1). Simplifying this, we get x^{2} + 4x - 4 = 0.Let the coordinates of the two intersection points of the line and the parabola be (x_{1}, y_{1}) and (x_{2}, y_{2}). According to Vieta's formulas, for a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots is given by x_{1} + x_{2} = -frac{b}{a}. Applying this to our equation, we find x_{1} + x_{2} = -frac{4}{1} = -4.Since y = -x + 1, we can find the sum of the y-coordinates of the intersection points as y_{1} + y_{2} = - (x_{1} + x_{2}) + 2 = -(-4) + 2 = 6.The length of the chord cut by the line on the parabola is given by the sum of the y-coordinates of the intersection points plus 2, which is y_{1} + y_{2} + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8.Therefore, the length of the chord cut on the parabola by the line is boxed{8}."},{"problem":"Example 6 Let n be a positive integer of the form a^{2}+b^{2}, where a, b are two coprime positive integers.

We will use the properties of permutations and the given operations to derive the solution.1. Define the Operations:   - We start with the sequence ( S = {1, 2, ldots, 2007} ).   - We perform 22 consecutive steps on ( S ):     - For ( 1 leq i leq 11 ), we choose a number ( x ) from ( S ) and replace it with ( x + a_i ).     - For ( 12 leq i leq 22 ), we choose a number ( x ) from ( S ) and replace it with ( x - a_{i-11} ).2. Understand the Permutations:   - A permutation of ( {1, 2, ldots, 2007} ) is even if the product ( prod_{i > j} (x_i - x_j) ) is positive, and odd if it is negative.   - The operations described will result in a permutation of the original sequence ( S ).3. Observation and Proof:   - Let ( b_j = a_j ) for ( 1 leq j leq 11 ) and ( b_j = -a_{j-11} ) for ( 12 leq j leq 22 ).   - If two elements become equal after adding ( b_1, ldots, b_l ), the total contribution of ( b_1, ldots, b_l ) at these fixed spots is 0.   - Suppose after some steps, ( s_i = s_j ). The sums of the added values to ( s_i ) and ( s_j ) must be equal, implying that the sequence is not a permutation of ( {1, ldots, 2007} ).4. Inductive Argument:   - If ( a_i ) is added to ( s_j ) and ( s_j + a_i leq 2007 ), we can assume the moves are ordered such that ( a_i ) is added to ( s_j ) first.   - This implies that ( a_1 ) cannot be added to ( 1, ldots, 2007 - a_1 ), then ( a_2 ) cannot be added to ( 1, ldots, 2007 - a_2 ), and so on.   - After a number gets added, it must be subtracted because otherwise, it would exceed 2007.5. Reordering Moves:   - Reorder the moves such that ( a_1 ) is added first, and the second move is subtracting the number that ( a_1 ) was added to.   - If the second move is ( -a_1 ), the two moves cancel out.   - If the second move is ( -a_2 ), the new number is ( x + a_1 - a_2 ). Since ( x + a_1 > 2007 ), it is positive, and since ( a_1 < a_2 ), the new number is less than ( x ), making two numbers equal, resulting in a contribution of 0.6. Counting the Operations:   - There are ( a_1 ) places to perform this operation, namely ( 2007 - a_1 + 1, ldots, 2007 ).   - By induction, adding and subtracting ( a_2, a_3, ldots, a_k ) gives a total contribution of ( prod_{j=2}^k a_j ) ways, leading to ( prod_{j=1}^k a_j ) ways.7. Conclusion:   - Since the base case can be easily verified, the conclusion follows that the number of odd operations and even operations are equal.The final answer is (boxed{0}) (the difference between the number of odd and even operations)."},{"problem":"On the edges D A, D B and D C of the pyramid A B C D, points K, L and M are taken respectively, such that D K=frac{1}{2} D A, D L=frac{2}{5} D B and D M=frac{3}{4} D C, G- is the point of intersection of the medians of triangle A B C.

These three types of nursing rooms are single rooms (1 nursing bed), double rooms (2 nursing beds), and triple rooms (3 nursing beds). Due to actual needs, the number of single rooms is between 10 and 30 (including 10 and 30), and the number of double rooms is twice the number of single rooms. Let t be the number of single rooms planned to be built.(I) According to the question, fill in the table below:| Number of Single Rooms | 10 | ... | t | ... | 30 ||------------------------|----|-----|-----|-----|----|| Number of Double Rooms | ___ | ... | 2t | ... | 60 || Number of Triple Rooms | 70 | ... | ___ | ... | ___ || Number of Nursing Beds | 260 | ... | ___ | ... | ___ |(II) If the nursing home can provide 200 nursing beds after completion, find the value of t.(III) Find the maximum and minimum number of nursing beds that the nursing home can provide after completion.","solution":" Step-by-Step Solution# Part (I) Filling in the Table1. Number of Double Rooms: Given that the number of double rooms is twice the number of single rooms, we can express the number of double rooms as 2t when the number of single rooms is t. Therefore, when t=10, the number of double rooms is 2 times 10 = 20. Similarly, when t=30, the number of double rooms is 2 times 30 = 60.2. Number of Triple Rooms: The total number of rooms planned is 100. Thus, the number of triple rooms can be found by subtracting the total number of single and double rooms from 100, which gives 100 - t - 2t = 100 - 3t. When t=10, the number of triple rooms is 100 - 3 times 10 = 70. When t=30, the number of triple rooms is 100 - 3 times 30 = 10.3. Number of Nursing Beds: The total number of nursing beds can be calculated by adding the number of beds in each type of room. Single rooms contribute 1 times t, double rooms contribute 2 times 2t, and triple rooms contribute 3 times (100 - 3t). Therefore, the total number of nursing beds is t + 4t + 300 - 9t = 300 - 4t. When t=10, the total number of nursing beds is 300 - 4 times 10 = 260. When t=30, the total number of nursing beds is 300 - 4 times 30 = 180.Filling in the table:| Number of Single Rooms | 10 | ... | t | ... | 30 ||------------------------|----|-----|-----|-----|----|| Number of Double Rooms | 20 | ... | 2t | ... | 60 || Number of Triple Rooms | 70 | ... | 100-3t | ... | 10 || Number of Nursing Beds | 260 | ... | 300-4t | ... | 180 |# Part (II) Finding the Value of tGiven that the total number of nursing beds after completion is 200, we have the equation 300-4t=200. Solving for t:[300 - 4t = 200 4t = 300 - 200 4t = 100 t = frac{100}{4} t = 25]Since t=25 is within the range of 10 to 30, it satisfies the condition. Therefore, the value of t is boxed{25}.# Part (III) Maximum and Minimum Number of Nursing Beds1. Maximum Number of Nursing Beds: The maximum number of nursing beds occurs when t is at its minimum value, which is 10. Substituting t=10 into the equation y=300-4t:[y = 300 - 4 times 10 y = 300 - 40 y = 260]Therefore, the maximum number of nursing beds is boxed{260}.2. Minimum Number of Nursing Beds: The minimum number of nursing beds occurs when t is at its maximum value, which is 30. Substituting t=30 into the equation y=300-4t:[y = 300 - 4 times 30 y = 300 - 120 y = 180]Therefore, the minimum number of nursing beds is boxed{180}."},{"problem":"3. m, n are positive integers.

Substituting t into the given function, we transform y=4^{x}+2^{x+1}+3 into a function of t: [f(t)=t^{2}+2t+3]Note that 4^x=(2^x)^2=t^2 and 2^{x+1}=2cdot2^x=2t, hence the transformation.3.

Observing the expression (t+1)^2 + 2, we see that the smallest value it can take is when (t+1)^2=0, which occurs when t+1=0 or t=-1. However, since t>0 (as t=2^x and 2^x>0 for all real x), the minimum of f(t) is greater than 2 plus the minimum value of t, which is 0.

However, this minimal value is not included in the function's range since t>0 implies that f(t) is always greater than this minimal computation.

Analyzing the sign of h'(x):- On (0, e^2), h'(x) > 0, so h(x) is increasing.- On (e^2, +infty), h'(x) < 0, so h(x) is decreasing.The maximum value of h(x) is at x = e^2:h_{text{max}} = h(e^2) = frac{ln e^2 - 1}{e^2} = frac{1}{e^2}.Therefore, the range of a is boxed{[frac{1}{e^2}, +infty)}."},{"problem":"3.

Adjust the numbers to match the total fee:   To make up the 26 difference, we can adjust the numbers of adults and children. Adding one adult increases the total by 25, and removing two children decreases the total by 24. Therefore, adding two adults and removing two children will increase the total by 26:   [   25 times 54 + 12 times 50 = 1350 + 600 = 1950   ]5. Verify the ratio:   The ratio of adults to children is:   [   frac{54}{50} = frac{27}{25}   ]Thus, the ratio of adults to children that results in a total admission fee of 1950 and is closest to 1 is ( boxed{frac{27}{25}} )."},{"problem":"Randomly select a number m in the interval (0,8).

Notice that if y is a root of the quadratic polynomial a x^{2}+b x+c, then 1 / y is a root of the quadratic polynomial c x^{2}+b x+a. Therefore, in the problem, we need to find the smallest natural a for which the roots x_{1} and x_{2} of some quadratic polynomial c x^{2}+b x+a (with integer b and c) are greater than 1000.

Let x_{1} and x_{2} be two distinct roots of the quadratic polynomial f(x)=a x^{2}+b x+c, where 0-frac{n b}{2}.Since the roots are distinct, the discriminant D=b^{2}-4 a c is positive.

The physicist can then repeat the process with the two resulting omons, choosing which omon to destroy at every step. The physicist initially has two omons whose masses are distinct positive integers less than 1000. What is the maximum possible number of times he can use his machine without producing an omon whose mass is not an integer?[i]Proposed by Michael Kural[/i]","solution":"1. Initial Setup: We start with two omons of masses (a) and (b), where (a) and (b) are distinct positive integers less than 1000. Without loss of generality, assume (a < b).2. Entanglement Process: The machine destroys the omon with mass (a), preserves the omon with mass (b), and creates a new omon with mass (frac{a + b}{2}). This process can be repeated with the new pair of omons.3. Mass Difference Analysis: Let (d = b - a). After the first entanglement, the new masses are (b) and (frac{a + b}{2}). The difference between these new masses is:   [   b - frac{a + b}{2} = frac{2b - (a + b)}{2} = frac{b - a}{2} = frac{d}{2}   ]   Thus, each entanglement halves the difference between the masses of the two omons.4. Integer Mass Condition: For the mass of the new omon to remain an integer, (frac{a + b}{2}) must be an integer. This implies that (a + b) must be even, which is always true since (a) and (b) are both integers.5. Maximum Number of Steps: We need to determine the maximum number of times the physicist can use the machine without producing a non-integer mass. This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of times we can halve the initial difference (d) before it becomes less than 1.6. Initial Difference: The maximum initial difference (d) is (999) (since (a) and (b) are distinct integers less than 1000).7. Halving Process: We need to find the largest (n) such that:   [   frac{999}{2^n} geq 1   ]   Solving for (n):   [   999 geq 2^n implies n leq log_2(999)   ]   Calculating (log_2(999)):   [   log_2(999) approx 9.96   ]   Since (n) must be an integer, the maximum (n) is 9.8. Verification: We can verify this by considering the sequence of differences:   [   999, 499.5, 249.75, 124.875, 62.4375, 31.21875, 15.609375, 7.8046875, 3.90234375, 1.951171875   ]   After 9 steps, the difference is still greater than 1, but after the 10th step, it becomes less than 1, indicating a non-integer mass.Conclusion:The maximum number of times the physicist can use his machine without producing an omon whose mass is not an integer is (boxed{9})."},{"problem":"Three.

(2) If A-C=15^{circ} and a=sqrt{2}csin A, find the area of triangle triangle ABC.","solution":" Part (1)Given that A + C = 120^{circ} and a = 2c, we can use the Law of Sines and trigonometric identities to find the length of side c.1. From the given information, we have sin A = 2sin C. Since A + C = 120^{circ}, we can express sin C as sin(120^{circ} - A).2. Therefore, we have sin A = 2sin(120^{circ} - A) = 2(sin 120^{circ}cos A + cos 120^{circ}sin A) = 2left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cos A - frac{1}{2}sin Aright).3. Simplifying, we get sin A = sqrt{3}cos A + sin A Rightarrow sqrt{3}cos A = 0.4. This implies cos A = 0, which means A = 90^{circ}. Consequently, C = 30^{circ} and B = 60^{circ}.Using the Law of Sines again with b = 2:5. frac{c}{sin C} = frac{b}{sin B} Rightarrow c = frac{2sin C}{sin 60^{circ}} = frac{2cdotfrac{1}{2}}{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}.Therefore, the length of side c is boxed{frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}}. Part (2)Given a = sqrt{2}csin A and A - C = 15^{circ}, we find the area of triangle ABC.1. From a = sqrt{2}csin A, we get sin A = sqrt{2}sin Csin A. Since sin A > 0, we deduce sin C = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.2. Given A - C = 15^{circ} and knowing sin C = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, we find that C = 45^{circ}, and thus A = 60^{circ} and B = 75^{circ}.Using the Law of Sines to find a:3. frac{a}{sin 60^{circ}} = frac{2}{sin 75^{circ}} = frac{8}{sqrt{2} + sqrt{6}}.4. Solving for a, we get a = frac{4sqrt{3}}{sqrt{2} + sqrt{6}} = 3sqrt{2} - sqrt{6}.Finally, to find the area S_{triangle ABC}:5. S_{triangle ABC} = frac{1}{2}absin C = frac{1}{2} times (3sqrt{2} - sqrt{6}) times 2 times frac{sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 - sqrt{3}.Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is boxed{3 - sqrt{3}}."},{"problem":"Given a gt 0, ab=1, then ()A: a+bgeqslant 2B: lg alg b gt 0C: frac{1}{a^2}+frac{1}{b^2}＜frac{4}{a+b}D: a^{3}+b^{3}geqslant 2","solution":"Given a > 0 and ab=1, we need to evaluate the truth of the given statements.For Option A:Given that a > 0 and ab = 1, it follows that b > 0.

There are three pairs of parallel faces so, if there is an encircling stripe, then the pair of faces that does not contribute uniquely determines the stripe orientation for the remaining faces.  In addition, the stripe on each face that does not contribute may be oriented in either of two different ways.

If no two stripes on those three faces are aligned, then there is no stripe encircling the cube. The probability that the stripes aren't aligned is frac{1}{4}, since for each alignment of one stripe, there is one and only one way to align the other two stripes out of four total possibilities. therefore there is a probability of frac{3}{4} that two stripes are aligned.Now consider the opposing vertex and the three sides adjacent to it. Given the two connected stripes next to our first vertex, we have two more that must be connected to make a continuous stripe. There is a probability of left(frac{1}{2}right)^2=frac{1}{4} that they are aligned, so there is a probability of frac{3}{4}cdot frac{1}{4}=boxed{frac {3}{16}} that there is a continuous stripe.Solution 5Each face has two possible stripes, so there are 2^6=64 ways in total.We need to choose 2 opposite faces to leave out.

We know that any k tellers together can always open the safe, but k-1 tellers never can. What is the minimum number of locks on the safe?","solution":"No matter how we choose k-1 treasurers, there is a lock to which none of them has a key; the other n-k+1 treasurers each have a key to this lock. Thus, for every k-1 element subset of the n treasurers, there is (at least) one lock that none of them can open, and different (k-1)-element sets correspond to different locks in this way. The number of locks is therefore at least as many as the number of k-1 element (treasurer) subsets, which is binom{n}{k-1}.We will show that this estimate is sharp, that is, there exists a distribution of keys such that the conditions of the problem are satisfied with binom{n}{k-1} locks. Number the locks from 1 to binom{n}{k-1}, and label the k-1 element subsets of the n treasurers with these same numbers. Consider the following distribution: a treasurer should receive a key to the i-th numbered lock if and only if they do not belong to the subset labeled with the i-th number. Then no k-1 treasurers can open the safe, since none of them has a key to the lock numbered with their set. However, among k treasurers, there is already an owner for each key, since (for every i) the number of those without a key to the i-th lock is exactly k-1.Ambrus Gergely (Szeged, Radnóti M.

(2) Calculate S_{n}.","solution":" Step-by-Step Solution# Part 1: Finding the General Formula for {a_{n}}Given the recurrence relation a_{n+1}=2a_n+2^{n+1}, we can manipulate it to find a pattern that leads to the general formula for the sequence.1. Divide both sides by 2^{n+1}:   [   frac{a_{n+1}}{2^{n+1}} = frac{a_n}{2^n} + 1   ]2. Rearrange to highlight the difference between consecutive terms:   [   frac{a_{n+1}}{2^{n+1}} - frac{a_n}{2^n} = 1   ]3. Recognize that left{frac{a_n}{2^n}right} forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1 and the first term being frac{a_1}{2} = frac{1}{2}.4. The n-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:   [   frac{a_n}{2^n} = frac{1}{2} + (n-1) cdot 1 = n - frac{1}{2}   ]5.

Understanding the Problem:   We have 12 friends playing a tennis tournament where each player plays exactly one game with each of the other 11 players.

We need to find the maximum possible value of the sum ( Sigma_3 = B_1^3 + B_2^3 + cdots + B_{12}^3 ), where ( B_i ) represents the points of the ( i )-th player.2. Total Points Calculation:   Each player plays 11 games, so there are a total of ( binom{12}{2} = 66 ) games. Since each game awards 1 point to the winner, the total number of points distributed among all players is 66. Therefore, we have:   [   B_1 + B_2 + cdots + B_{12} = 66   ]3. Maximizing the Sum of Cubes:   To maximize ( Sigma_3 = B_1^3 + B_2^3 + cdots + B_{12}^3 ), we should distribute the points as unevenly as possible. This is because the function ( f(x) = x^3 ) is convex, and by Jensen's inequality, the sum of cubes is maximized when the distribution of points is as extreme as possible.4. Optimal Distribution:   The most extreme distribution of points, given that the total sum is 66, is to have one player with 11 points, another with 10 points, another with 9 points, and so on down to one player with 0 points.

Clearly, AA' perp BC, the midpoint of A'O lies on BC, and A' lies on the circle through B and C with center O'.

If this number is expressed as a fraction frac{m}{n} in lowest terms, what is the product mn?","solution":"Solution 1As with some of the other solutions, we analyze this with a locus—but a different one.  We'll consider: given a point P and a line ell, what is the set of points X such that the midpoint of PX lies on line ell?  The answer to this question is: a line m parallel to ell, such that m and P are (1) on opposite sides of ell. and (2) at the same distance from ell.Applied to this problem, this means that D is the only point that lies on both (1) the given circle, and (2) the line through D parallel to BC.  This means that BC is parallel to the tangent to the given circle at D.If we take O to be the center of the given circle, then this means that OD is perpendicular to BC.  Let M be the midpoint of chord BC, and let N be the intersection of OD with the line through A parallel to BC.Since BC = 6, we know that BM = 3; since OB (a radius of the circle) is 5, we can conclude that triangle BMO is a 3-4-5 right triangle.  Since D and line AN are equidistant from line BC, we know that MN = 1, and thus ON = 3.  This makes triangle ANO also a 3-4-5 right triangle.We're looking for sin angle AOB, and we can find that using the [ angle subtraction formula](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Trigonometric_identities#Angle_addition_identities) for sine.  We havebegin{align*} sin angle AOB &= sin(angle AOM - angle BOM)  &= sin angle AOM cos angle BOM - cos angle AOM sin angle BOM  &= frac{4}{5} cdot frac{4}{5}  - frac{3}{5} cdot frac{3}{5}  &= frac{16 - 9}{25} = frac{7}{25}. end{align*}This is in lowest terms, so our answer is mn = 7 cdot 25 = 175.Solution 2-Credit to Adamz for diagram-Let A be any fixed point on circle O, and let AD be a chord of circle O. The [locus](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Locus) of midpoints N of the chord AD is a circle P, with diameter AO. Generally, the circle P can intersect the chord BC at two points, one point, or they may not have a point of intersection. By the problem condition, however, the circle P is tangent to BC at point N. Let M be the midpoint of the chord BC. From right triangle OMB, we have OM = sqrt{OB^2 - BM^2} =4. This gives tan angle BOM = frac{BM}{OM} = frac 3 4.Notice that the distance OM equals PN + PO cos angle AOM = r(1 + cos angle AOM), where r is the radius of circle P. Hence [cos angle AOM = frac{OM}{r} - 1 = frac{2OM}{R} - 1 = frac 8 5 - 1 = frac 3 5] (where R represents the radius, 5, of the large circle given in the question). Therefore, since angle AOM is clearly acute, we see that [tan angle AOM =frac{sqrt{1 - cos^2 angle AOM}}{cos angle AOM} = frac{sqrt{5^2 - 3^2}}{3} = frac 4 3]Next, notice that angle AOB = angle AOM - angle BOM. We can therefore apply the subtraction formula for tan to obtain [tan angle AOB =frac{tan angle AOM - tan angle BOM}{1 + tan angle AOM cdot tan angle BOM} =frac{frac 4 3 - frac 3 4}{1 + frac 4 3 cdot frac 3 4} = frac{7}{24}] It follows that sin angle AOB =frac{7}{sqrt{7^2+24^2}} = frac{7}{25}, such that the answer is 7 cdot 25=boxed{175}.Solution 3This solution, while similar to Solution 2, is arguably more motivated and less contrived.Firstly, we note the statement in the problem that \\"AD is the only chord starting at A and bisected by BC\\" – what is its significance? What is the criterion for this statement to be true?We consider the locus of midpoints of the chords from A. It is well-known that this is the circle with diameter AO, where O is the center of the circle. The proof is simple: every midpoint of a chord is a dilation of the endpoint with scale factor frac{1}{2} and center A. Thus, the locus is the result of the dilation with scale factor frac{1}{2} and centre A of circle O. Let the center of this circle be P.Now, AD is bisected by BC if they cross at some point N on the circle. Moreover, since AD is the only chord, BC must be tangent to the circle P.The rest of this problem is straightforward.Our goal is to find sin angle AOB = sin{left(angle AOM - angle BOMright)}, where M is the midpoint of BC. We have BM=3 and OM=4.Let R be the projection of A onto OM, and similarly let Q be the projection of P onto OM. Then it remains to find AR so that we can use the addition formula for sin.As PN is a radius of circle P, PN=2.5, and similarly, PO=2.5. Since OM=4, we have OQ=OM-QM=OM-PN=4-2.5=1.5. Thus PQ=sqrt{2.5^2-1.5^2}=2.Further, we see that triangle OAR is a dilation of triangle OPQ about center O with scale factor 2, so AR=2PQ=4.Lastly, we apply the formula:[sin{left(angle AOM - angle BOMright)} = sin angle AOM cos angle BOM - sin angle BOM cos angle AOM = left(frac{4}{5}right)left(frac{4}{5}right)-left(frac{3}{5}right)left(frac{3}{5}right)=frac{7}{25}]Thus the answer is 7cdot25=boxed{175}.Solution 4 (coordinate geometry)Aime1983p15s2.pngLet the circle have equation x^2 + y^2 = 25, with centre O(0,0). Since BC=6, we can calculate (by the Pythagorean Theorem) that the distance from O to the line BC is 4. Therefore, we can let B=(3,4) and C=(-3,4). Now, assume that A is any point on the major arc BC, and D any point on the minor arc BC. We can write A=(5 cos alpha, 5 sin alpha), where alpha is the angle measured from the positive x axis to the ray OA. It will also be convenient to define angle XOB = alpha_0. Firstly, since B must lie in the minor arc AD, we see that alpha in left(-frac{pi}{2}-alpha_0,alpha_0right). However, since the midpoint of AD must lie on BC, and the highest possible y-coordinate of D is 5, we see that the y-coordinate cannot be lower than 3, that is, alpha in left[sin^{-1}frac{3}{5},alpha_0right).Secondly, there is a theorem that says that, in a circle, if a chord is bisected by a radius, then they must be perpendicular. Therefore, suppose that P is the intersection point of AD and BC, so that by the theorem, OP is perpendicular to AD. So, if AD is the only chord starting at A which is bisected by BC, this means that P is the only point on the chord BC such that OP is perpendicular to AD. Now suppose that P=(p,4), where p in (-3,3). The fact that OP must be perpendicular to AD is equivalent to the following equation:[-1 = left(text{slope of } OPright)left(text{slope of } APright)]which becomes[-1 = frac{4}{p} cdot frac{5sin alpha - 4}{5cos alpha - p}]This rearranges to[p^2 - (5cos alpha)p + 16 - 20 sin alpha = 0]Given that this equation must have only one real root pin (-3,3), we study the following function:[f(x) =  x^2 - (5cos alpha)x + 16 - 20 sin alpha]First, by the fact that the equation f(x)=0 has real solutions, its discriminant Delta must be non-negative, so we calculate[begin{split}Delta & = (5cos alpha)^2 - 4(16-20sin alpha)  & =  25 (1- sin^2 alpha)  - 64 + 80 sin alpha  & = -25 sin^2 alpha + 80sin alpha - 39  & =  (13 - 5sin alpha)(5sin alpha - 3)end{split}]It is obvious that this is in fact non-negative. If it is actually zero, then sin alpha = frac{3}{5}, and cos alpha = frac{4}{5}. In this case, p = frac{5cos alpha}{2} = 2 in (-3,3), so we have found a possible solution. We thus calculate sin(text{central angle of minor arc } AB) = sin (alpha_0 - alpha) = frac{4}{5}cdot frac{4}{5} - frac{3}{5} cdot frac{3}{5} = frac{7}{25} by the subtraction formula for sin. This means that the answer is 7 cdot 25 = 175.Addendum to Solution 4Since this is an AIME problem, we can assume that we are done since we have found one possible case. However, in a full-solution contest, we could not assume that the answer is unique, but would need to prove that this is the unique solution. This can be proven as follows.Suppose that Delta > 0, which would mean that there could be two real roots of f(x), one lying in the interval (-3,3), and another outside of it. We also see, by [Vieta's Formulas](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Vieta%27s_Formulas), that the average of the two roots is frac{5cos alpha}{2}, which is non-negative, so the root outside of (-3,3) must be no less than 3. By considering the graph of y=f(x), which is a \\"U-shaped\\" parabola, it is now evident that f(-3) > 0 and f(3)leq 0. We can just use the second inequality:[0 geq  f(3) =  25  - 15cos alpha - 20 sin alpha]so[3cos alpha + 4 sin alpha  geq 5]The only way for this inequality to be satisfied is when A=B (by applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, or just plotting the line 3x+4y=5 to see that point A can't be above this line), which does not make sense in the original problem statement. (For it would mean that the point A lies in the half-plane above the line 3x+4y=5, inclusive, and the half-plane below the line -3x+4y=5, exclusive. This can be seen to be impossible by drawing the lines and observing that the intersection of the two half-planes does not share any point with the circle.)Solution 5Let the center of the circle be O. Fix B,C, and A. Then, as D moves around the circle, the locus of the midpoints of AD is clearly a circle. Since the problems gives that AD is the only chord starting at A bisected by BC, it follows that the circle with diameter DO and AO is tangent to BC.Now, let the intersection of BC and AD be E and let the midpoint of AO (the center of the circle tangent to BC that we described beforehand) be F. Drop the altitude from O to BC and call its intersection with BC K. Drop the perpendicular from F to KO and call its intersection with KO L. Clearly, KO = sqrt{OC^2-KC^2} = sqrt{5^2-3^2} = 4 and since EF is radius, it equals frac{5}{2}. The same applies for FO, which also equals frac{5}{2}. By the Pythagorean theorem, we deduce that FL = 2, so EK = 2. This is very important information! Now we know that BE = 1, so by Power of a Point, AE = ED = sqrt{5}.We’re almost there! Since by the Pythagorean theorem, ED^2 + EO^2 = 25, we deduce that EO = 2sqrt{5}. EC=OC=5, so sin (CEO) = frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}. Furthermore, since sin (CEO) = cos(DEC), we know that cos (DEC) = frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}. By the law of cosines,[DC^2 = (sqrt{5})^2 + 5^2 -10sqrt{5} cdot frac{2sqrt{5}}{5} = 10]Therefore, DC = sqrt{10} Longleftrightarrow BA = sqrt{2}. Now, drop the altitude from O to BA and call its intersection with BA Z. Then, by the Pythagorean theorem, OZ = frac{7sqrt{2}}{2}. Thus, sin (BOZ) = frac{sqrt{2}}{10} and cos (BOZ) = frac{7sqrt{2}}{10}. As a result, sin (BOA) = sin (2 BOZ) = 2sin(BOZ)cos(BOZ) = frac{7}{25}. 7 cdot 25 = boxed{175}.Solution 6[Dgram.png](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/File:Dgram.png) [](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/File:Dgram.png)Let I be the intersection of AD and BC.Lemma: AI = ID if and only if angle AIO = 90.Proof: If AI = ID, we get AO = OD, and thus IO is a perpendicular bisector of AD. If angle AIO = 90, We can get triangle AIO cong triangle OIDLet  be this the circle with diameter AO.Thus, we get angle AIO = 90, implying I must lie on omega. I also must lie on BC. If both of these conditions are satisfied, The extension of AI intersecting with circle O will create a point D such that AI = ID. Thus, since AD is the only chord starting at A, there must be only 1 possible I, implying the circle with diameter AO is tangent to BC.Now, create a coordinate system such that the origin is O and the y-axis is perpendicular to BC. The positive x direction is from B to C.Let Z be (0,5).Let Y be (-5,0).Let X be the center of omega. Since omega's radius is frac{5}{2}, the altitude from X to OY is 1.5, since the altitude from I to OY is 4. XO is 2.5, so sin(XOY) = sin(AOY) = frac{3}{5}. sin(BOZ) =  frac{3}{5}. If we let sin(theta) = frac{3}{5}, we can find that what we are looking for is sin(90 - 2theta), which we can evaluate and get frac{7}{25} implies boxed{175}-AlexlikemathSolution 7 (No Trig)Let O be the center of the circle. The locus of midpoints of chords with A as a endpoint is a circle with diameter overline{AO}. Additionally, this circle must be tangent to overline{BC}. Let the center of this circle be P. Let M be the midpoint of BC, N be the foot of the perpendicular from P to overline{BM}, and K be the foot of the perpendicular from B to overline{AP}. Let x=BK.From right triangle BKO, we get KO = sqrt{25-x^2}. Thus, KP = sqrt{25-x^2}-frac52.Since BO = 5, BM = 3, and angle BMO is right, MO=4. From quadrilateral MNPO, we get MN = sqrt{PO^2 - (MO - NP)^2} = sqrt{(5/2)^2 - (4 - 5/2)^2} = sqrt{(5/2)^2 - (3/2)^2} = 2. Thus, BN = 1.Since angles BNP and BKP are right, we get [BK^2+KP^2 = BN^2 + NP^2 implies x^2 + left(sqrt{25-x^2}-frac52right)^2 = left(frac52right)^2 + 1][25 - 5sqrt{25-x^2} = 1][5sqrt{25-x^2} = 24][25(25-x^2) = 24^2][25x^2 = 25^2 - 24^2 = 49][x = frac75]Thus, sin angle AOB = frac{x}{5} = frac{7}{25}implies boxed{175}.~rayfish"},{"problem":"Determine all solutions of the diophantine equation a^2 = b cdot (b + 7) in integers age 0 and b ge 0.(W.

Choosing Coefficients:   Consider the polynomial ( y^3 - frac{3}{4}y ). We need to check if this polynomial achieves the minimum possible maximum value over the interval ( -1 leq y leq 1 ). 4. Checking Extremal Values:   The extremal values of ( y^3 - frac{3}{4}y ) occur at ( y = pm 1 ) and ( y = 0 ). Evaluating at these points:   [   y = 1: quad 1^3 - frac{3}{4}(1) = frac{1}{4}   ]   [   y = -1: quad (-1)^3 - frac{3}{4}(-1) = -frac{1}{4}   ]   [   y = 0: quad 0^3 - frac{3}{4}(0) = 0   ]   The maximum absolute value is ( frac{1}{4} ).5. Verification:   Suppose there exists a polynomial ( y^3 + a'y^2 + b'y + c' ) with a smaller maximum absolute value over ( -1 leq y leq 1 ). By differentiation, the extremal values of ( y^3 + b'y ) occur at ( y = pm sqrt{-b'/3} ) (if ( b' < 0 )) and ( y = pm 1 ).    If ( b' < -frac{3}{4} ), then ( y = 1 ) gives a maximum greater than ( frac{1}{4} ), and ( y = -1 ) gives a minimum less than ( -frac{1}{4} ). This implies that the magnitude of the polynomial exceeds ( frac{1}{4} ), which is inadmissible.   If ( b' > -frac{3}{4} ), similar arguments show that the magnitude of the polynomial exceeds ( frac{1}{4} ).6. Conclusion:   Therefore, the smallest possible value of ( F ) is achieved when ( a = 0 ), ( b = -frac{3}{4} ), and ( c = 0 ), giving ( F = frac{1}{4} ).The final answer is ( boxed{frac{1}{4}} )."},{"problem":"There are three cities A, B, and C.

If n is a prime, show that a proper good subset of X contains exactly four elements.","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We are given a regular polygon ( A_1A_2 cdots A_n ) with ( n ge 4 ) vertices, where ( n ) is a prime number. We need to show that a proper good subset of ( X = {1, 2, ldots, n} ) contains exactly four elements. A subset ( {i_1, i_2, ldots, i_k} ) is called a good subset if the angles of the polygon ( A_{i_1}A_{i_2} cdots A_{i_k} ), when arranged in increasing order, form an arithmetic progression.2. Angles in the Polygon:   The angle between any three vertices of the polygon is an integral multiple of ( frac{pi}{n} ). This is because twice this angle is an angle subtended at the center by a chord joining two vertices of the polygon, and therefore is a multiple of ( frac{2pi}{n} ).3. Arithmetic Progression of Angles:   Let the arithmetic progression have ( frac{api}{n} ) as the first term and ( frac{dpi}{n} ) as the common difference. The angles of the polygon ( A_{i_1}A_{i_2} cdots A_{i_k} ) in increasing order are ( frac{api}{n}, frac{(a+d)pi}{n}, frac{(a+2d)pi}{n}, ldots, frac{(a+(k-1)d)pi}{n} ).4. Sum of the Angles:   The sum of the interior angles of a ( k )-sided polygon is ( (k-2)pi ). Therefore, the sum of the angles in our arithmetic progression is:   [   frac{pi}{n} left( a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + cdots + (a+(k-1)d) right)   ]   Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, this becomes:   [   frac{pi}{n} left( k cdot a + d cdot frac{k(k-1)}{2} right)   ]5. Equating the Sums:   Equate this sum to the sum of the interior angles of a ( k )-sided polygon:   [   frac{pi}{n} left( k cdot a + d cdot frac{k(k-1)}{2} right) = (k-2)pi   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   k cdot a + d cdot frac{k(k-1)}{2} = n(k-2)   ]   [   2n(k-2) = k(2a + (k-1)d)   ]6. Divisibility Condition:   From the equation ( 2n(k-2) = k(2a + (k-1)d) ), we deduce that ( k ) must divide ( 4n ). Since ( n ) is a prime number and ( k > 2 ), the possible values of ( k ) are the factors of ( 4n ) that are greater than 2 and less than ( n ). The factors of ( 4n ) are ( 1, 2, 4, n, 2n, 4n ).7.

From the first equation, we have np = 30. Substituting np = 30 into the second equation gives 30(1-p) = 20. Simplifying this, we get 30 - 30p = 20, which leads to 30p = 10 and thus p = frac{1}{3}. Therefore, since the statement claims p = frac{2}{3}, option A is incorrect.- For option B, the coefficients of the third and eighth terms being equal implies C_9^2 = C_9^7, which means n = 9. The constant term in the expansion of (ax + frac{1}{sqrt{x}})^9 corresponds to the term where the power of x is zero. Setting the general term's exponent of x to zero, 9 - frac{3}{2}r = 0, we find r = 6. The coefficient of this term is C_9^6 cdot a^3.

Therefore, this statement is not universally correct.- Statement B: The formula to calculate the sum of interior angles of any polygon is (n-2) times 180^{circ}, where n is the number of sides. For a hexagon, n=6, so the sum of its interior angles is (6-2) times 180^{circ} = 4 times 180^{circ} = 720^{circ}.

Calculate the diagonal of the board:   The diagonal ( d ) of the board can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:   [   d = sqrt{64^2 + 4^2} = sqrt{4096 + 16} = sqrt{4112}   ]3. Simplify the diagonal:   [   d = sqrt{4112} = sqrt{16 times 257} = 4sqrt{257}   ]4. Determine the angle the diagonal makes with the longer side:   Let (theta) be the angle the diagonal makes with the longer side of the board.

Substitute back to find the height:   [   h = 4sqrt{257} cdot frac{sqrt{3} + 16}{2sqrt{257}} = 2(sqrt{3} + 16) = 32 + 2sqrt{3}   ]7.

Now we need to divide 5 circles into two groups, so that the total area of the two groups is as close as possible, or in other words, the ratio of the total areas of the two groups is as close to 1 as possible. Since each circle's area has a common factor of (pi / 4), and we are concerned with the ratio of the areas, we can eliminate this common factor, simplifying the problem to: divide the 5 circles into two groups so that the sum of the squares of the diameters of the two groups is as close as possible.The squares of the diameters of the 5 circles are 9, 16, 25, 64, 81.The sum of these 5 numbers is 195.

For put u = x, v = y - x, w = z - x. Then x = u, y = u + v, z = u + w, so we can write p(x, y, z) = q(u, v, w), where q is a polynomial. But we are given that f(v, w) = q(u, v, w) for all u, v, w, so u cannot appear in q (otherwise we could vary it to get a contradiction). Hence f is actually a polynomial. But now the relation with t implies that each term has degree 2. So p(x, y, z) = a(y - x) 2 + b(y - x)(z - x) + c(z - x) 2 for some a, b, c.

In addition, since each move changes the sum of indices from even to odd or from odd to even and the piece starts on a square with an even sum of indices, after an even number of moves the sum of indices must be even.

If i+j=10, this uses up all 10 moves; otherwise, the piece can waste the remaining 10-i-j moves (which is an even number of moves since i+j is even) simply by moving the piece down a square and then up a square until 10 moves are reached.We have shown that the squares that could be marked with an mathrm{X} are the squares of indices (i, j) where i+j is an even number leq 10. Since the squares with i+j=n form a diagonal of length n+1 extending from the left side of the board to the top of the board, there are 1+3+5+7+9+11=36 such squares.Note that if the chessboard is colored black and white in the usual way with a black square in the top left corner, then these squares are the top left square together with the next 5 black diagonals that run from the left side to the top of the board."},{"problem":"19.

A piece is randomly broken off from each of three identical rods. What is the probability that these three pieces can be used to form an acute triangle?","solution":"97. In this problem, we consider the same experiment as in the previous one. As before, the set of all possible outcomes of the experiment is represented by the set of points of the cube (O A B C D E F G) with side length (l); the probability of an event is equal to the ratio of the volume of the part of the cube corresponding to favorable outcomes of the experiment to the volume of the entire cube. Thus, we only need to determine which points of the cube correspond to favorable outcomes of the experiment.According to the cosine theorem in an acute triangle, the square of each side is less than the sum of the squares of the other two sides, while in an obtuse triangle, the square of the side opposite the obtuse angle is greater than the sum of the squares of the other two sides, and in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the legs. Therefore, for three segments to form an acute triangle, the square of each of these segments must be less than the sum of the squares of the other two ({ }^{1}). Thus, the difference between the solution of this problem and the previous one is that now the favorable outcomes of the experiment will be determined not by inequalities (*) (see the solution to problem 96), but by the inequalitiesx^{2}+y^{2}>z^{2}, quad x^{2}+z^{2}>y^{2}, quad y^{2}+z^{2}>x^{2}The equality (x^{2}+y^{2}=z^{2}) means that the distance (M Q=sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}) from the point (M) with coordinates (x, y, z) to the (O z) axis is equal to the segment (O Q) on the (O z) axis (Fig. 85, a). From this, it is clear that all points for which (x^{2}+y^{2}=z^{2}) will lie on the surface of a cone with the axis being the line (O D) and the angle between the axis and the generatrix being (45^{circ}); points for which (z^{2}>x^{2}+y^{2}) (these points correspond to unfavorable outcomes of the experiment) will be located inside this cone. Similarly, the inequalities (y^{2}>x^{2}+z^{2}) and (x^{2}>y^{2}+z^{2}) define two cones with axes being the lines (O C) and (O A) (Fig. 85, b). Inside the cube (O A B C D E F G), one quarter of each of these three cones is placed; they do not intersect and the height of each is equal to the length of the cube's edge (l), and the radius of the base is also equal to (l) (since the angle between the axis and the generatrix is (45^{circ})). The volume of one quarter of such a cone is obviously equal tofrac{1}{4} cdot frac{1}{3} pi l^{2} cdot l=frac{pi l^{3}}{12}Therefore, the volume of the part of the cube corresponding to unfavorable outcomes of the experiment is (3 frac{pi l^{3}}{12}=frac{pi l^{3}}{4}), and the volume of the part of the cube corresponding to favorable outcomes is (l^{3} - frac{pi l^{3}}{4}).From this, it follows that the probability sought in the problem isfrac{l^{3}-frac{pi l^{3}}{4}}{l^{3}}=1-frac{pi}{4}=0.2146 ldots![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_68334347b64402497ba5g-328.jpg?height=382&width=872&top_left_y=465&top_left_x=134)Fig. 85."},{"problem":"3B.

We can use the sum of angles formula for sine to express it:sinleft(α+ frac {π}{4}right) = sin α cos frac {π}{4} + cos α sin frac {π}{4}.Knowing that cos frac {π}{4} = sin frac {π}{4} = frac {sqrt{2}}{2}, we can substitute those values into the expression:sinleft(α+ frac {π}{4}right) = sin α frac {sqrt{2}}{2} + cos α frac {sqrt{2}}{2}.Using the half-angle identities for sine and cosine, we know that sin^2 α = frac {1 - cos 2α}{2} and cos^2 α = frac {1 + cos 2α}{2}. However, since sin 2α = frac {1}{2}, we have cos 2α = sqrt{1 - sin^2 2α} = sqrt{1 - left(frac {1}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{frac {3}{4}} = frac {sqrt{3}}{2} because cos 2α must be positive based on the interval of α.Substituting the values of sin α and cos α using the identities gives us:sin α = sqrt{frac {1 - cos 2α}{2}} = sqrt{frac {1 - frac {sqrt{3}}{2}}{2}} = sqrt{frac {2 - sqrt{3}}{4}},cos α = sqrt{frac {1 + cos 2α}{2}} = sqrt{frac {1 + frac {sqrt{3}}{2}}{2}} = sqrt{frac {2 + sqrt{3}}{4}}.Returning to our expression for sinleft(α+ frac {π}{4}right), and noting that sin α and cos α must both be positive within the given interval:sinleft(α+ frac {π}{4}right) = left(sqrt{frac {2 - sqrt{3}}{4}} + sqrt{frac {2 + sqrt{3}}{4}} right) frac {sqrt{2}}{2}.This simplifies to:sinleft(α+ frac {π}{4}right) = frac {sqrt{2}}{2} left(sqrt{frac {4}{4}}right),sinleft(α+ frac {π}{4}right) = frac {sqrt{2}}{2}.Given that α + frac {π}{4} is in the interval (frac {π}{4}, frac {3π}{4}), where the sine function is positive, we can assert that sinleft(α+ frac {π}{4}right) must also be positive, and since sin frac{π}{3} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} and α + frac{π}{4} lies in (frac{π}{4}, frac{3π}{4}), the correct answer is frac{sqrt{3}}{2}.Therefore, we have:sinleft(α+ frac {π}{4}right) = boxed{frac {sqrt{3}}{2}}."},{"problem":"5.

First, the store increases the price by 30%. This can be represented as an increase to 130% of the original cost price, or mathematically, (1 + 30%) times a = 1.3a.2. After the peak season, the store offers a 20% discount on the increased price. A 20% discount means the product is sold at 80% of the increased price, which can be represented as 1.3a times 0.8.3. To find the profit per unit, we subtract the original cost price from the final selling price. The final selling price after the discount is 1.3a times 0.8. Therefore, the profit per unit is calculated as follows:   [   (1.3a times 0.8) - a   ]4.

Sum of First ( n ) Natural Numbers:   The sum of the first ( n ) natural numbers is given by:   [   S_n = frac{n(n+1)}{2}   ]   If ( S_n ) is a perfect square, then there exists an integer ( k ) such that:   [   frac{n(n+1)}{2} = k^2   ]2. Perfect Square Condition:   We need to find ( n ) such that ( frac{n(n+1)}{2} ) is a perfect square. This can be rewritten as:   [   n(n+1) = 2k^2   ]   This is a Diophantine equation, and we need to find integer solutions for ( n ) and ( k ).3. Pell's Equation:   The equation ( n(n+1) = 2k^2 ) can be transformed into a Pell's equation. By setting ( x = 2n+1 ) and ( y = 2k ), we get:   [   x^2 - 2y^2 = 1   ]   This is a standard Pell's equation, and its solutions can be generated using the fundamental solution ( (x_1, y_1) = (3, 2) ) and the recurrence relations:   [   x_{n+1} = 3x_n + 4y_n   ]   [   y_{n+1} = 2x_n + 3y_n   ]4. Generating Solutions:   Starting with the fundamental solution ( (x_1, y_1) = (3, 2) ), we can generate further solutions.

Conclusion:   For these values of ( n ), every permutation of ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ) will contain at least one partial sum that is a perfect square. This is because the sum of all elements is a perfect square, and any permutation will have at least one partial sum that is a perfect square.The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 1, 8, 49, ldots } )"},{"problem":"[Example 4.4.4] There is a tetrahedron A-BCD, where the sum of the dihedral angles at each vertex is 180^{circ}, and it has three unequal edge lengths of sqrt{34}, sqrt{58}, and sqrt{74}.

Unfold the tetrahedron, i.e., place triangle A B C, triangle A C D, triangle A B D on the plane of triangle B C D.Since angle A B D+angle C B D+angle A B C=180^{circ}, then A_{1}, B, A_{2} are collinear, similarly A_{2}, C, A_{3} are collinear, and A_{1}, D, A_{3} are collinear.At this point, triangle A_{1} B D, triangle B A_{2} C, triangle D C A_{3}, and triangle C D B are congruent triangles, thus A_{1} B=A_{2} B =C D, A_{1} D=A_{3} D=B C, A_{2} C=A_{3} C= B D, meaning that the pairs of opposite edges of the tetrahedron A-B C D are all equal. Therefore, the three unequal edge lengths given in the problem are the lengths of the three pairs of opposite edges.For a tetrahedron with equal opposite edges, we can complete it into a rectangular prism M D N C-B P A Q, where the face diagonals A B and C D, A D and B C, A C and B D are the three pairs of opposite edges of the tetrahedron A-B C D. At this time, the volume V of the tetrahedron can be found through the volume of the rectangular prism.Let the length, width, and height of the rectangular prism be a, b, c, respectively, then we haveleft{begin{array}{l}a^{2}+b^{2}=34 b^{2}+c^{2}=58 c^{2}+a^{2}=74end{array}right.Solving this, we geta=5, b=3, c=7 .Thus,V=V_{text {MDNC-BPAQ }}-4 V_{B-M C D} text {, }which isV=a b c-4 cdot frac{1}{3} cdot frac{1}{2} a b c=frac{1}{3} a b c=35 .Completing the tetrahedron with equal opposite edges into a rectangular prism is a crucial step in solving this problem.A tetrahedron with equal opposite edges is called an isosceles tetrahedron.

For each n,determine the maximum dimension of a linear space of complex ntimes n matrices consisting of t-normal matrices.Proposed by Shachar Carmeli, Weizmann Institute of Science","solution":"1. Identify t-normal matrices: A matrix ( A ) is called t-normal if ( AA^t = A^t A ), where ( A^t ) is the transpose of ( A ). Symmetric matrices, where ( A = A^t ), are trivially t-normal because ( AA^t = A^2 = A^t A ).2. Dimension of symmetric matrices: The space of symmetric ( n times n ) matrices has dimension ( frac{n(n+1)}{2} ). This is because a symmetric matrix is determined by its entries on and above the main diagonal, which counts ( frac{n(n+1)}{2} ) entries.3. Assume a larger space: Assume we have a space ( S ) of t-normal matrices with dimension at least ( frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1 ). The real dimension of ( S ) would then be at least ( n(n+1) + 2 ) because each complex dimension corresponds to two real dimensions.4. Construct a real space ( X ): Consider the real space ( X ) of matrices of the form ( A + iB ), where ( A ) is a nilpotent upper triangular real matrix and ( B ) is a nilpotent lower triangular real matrix. The dimension of ( X ) is ( n(n-1) ) because there are ( frac{n(n-1)}{2} ) entries in both ( A ) and ( B ).5. Intersection of ( S ) and ( X ): Since the dimension of ( S ) is greater than the dimension of ( X ), by the pigeonhole principle, ( S ) and ( X ) must have a non-trivial intersection. This means there exists a non-zero matrix ( A + iB ) in both ( S ) and ( X ).6. Analyze the intersection: For ( A + iB ) to be t-normal, we have:   [   (A + iB)(A^t + iB^t) = (A^t + iB^t)(A + iB)   ]   Taking the real part, we get:   [   AA^t + B^tB = A^tA + BB^t   ]   This equation implies that the upper left corner of ( A ) and ( B^t ) must vanish. By induction on ( n ), this leads to ( A = 0 ) and ( B = 0 ), which is a contradiction since we assumed a non-zero matrix.7.

Claim: The maximal number of regions occurs when no three of the chords are concurrent.2. Proof: Let ( l_1 ), ( l_2 ), and ( l_3 ) be three chords that concur at a single point. Then, shift ( l_3 ) by an arbitrarily small margin such that ( l_1, l_2, l_3 ) no longer concur, and the intersections and regions ( l_3 ) creates with all chords other than ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) are not affected. In this manner, the number of regions by having these chords not concur increases (by 1), since through this shifting, a new region determined by ( l_1 ), ( l_2 ), and ( l_3 ) is created. Applying this logic to every set of 3 or more chords yields the desired result. 3. Now, treat the optimal configuration as a graph. We first compute the number of vertices. Observe that there is a bijection between chord intersection points inside the circle and sets of 4 points on the circumference, because each such intersection point is the intersection of the diagonals of a quadrilateral with its vertices on the circumference, and vice versa. As a result, there are ( binom{n}{4} ) intersection points, and combining this with the ( n ) points on the circumference gives ( binom{n}{4} + n ) vertices in the graph.4. We then compute the number of edges. There are ( binom{n}{2} ) chords connecting the ( n ) points on the circumference, and each of the ( binom{n}{4} ) interior intersection points creates 2 additional edges, because it splits each of the 2 edges it lies on into 2 smaller edges. As a result, there are ( 2 binom{n}{4} + binom{n}{2} ) edges inside the circle, and combining this with the ( n ) arcs forming the circumference yields ( 2 binom{n}{4} + binom{n}{2} + n ) edges in the graph.5.

We partially factorize n as a product of prime numbers: n=2^{x} times 5^{y} times m, where x and y are natural numbers and m is a non-zero natural number that is coprime with 2 and 5.We will then prove the property mathcal{P}_{n} by induction on n: player mathrm{X} will lose if x and y are both even, and will win otherwise. First, mathcal{P}_{1} is obvious, since X will have to replace the number n=1 with a number between 1 / 10 and 9 / 10.Let then n geqslant 1 be any integer. Suppose mathcal{P}_{1}, ldots, mathcal{P}_{n}, and we will prove mathcal{P}_{n+1}.triangleright If x and/or y is odd, we denote r and s as the remainders of x and y modulo 2. Then player mathrm{X} replaces the integer n with the integer n^{prime}=n /left(2^{r} times 5^{s}right). Since n^{prime}=2^{x-r} times 5^{y-s} times m, the property mathcal{P}_{n^{prime}} ensures that the opponent of mathrm{X} will lose.triangleright If x and y are both even, we still assume that mathrm{X} replaces n with an integer n^{prime} (which is only possible if x geqslant 1 or y geqslant 1). If mathrm{X} replaces n with the number n^{prime}=n / 2=2^{x-1} times 5^{y} times m, then mathcal{P}_{n^{prime}} ensures that the opponent of mathrm{X} will win. Otherwise, we can write n^{prime} in the form n^{prime}=2^{x^{prime}} times 5^{y-1} times m^{prime} (with m^{prime} coprime with 2 and 5): regardless of the values of x^{prime} and m^{prime}, the property mathcal{P}_{n^{prime}} still ensures that the opponent of mathrm{X} will lose.We thus have the property mathcal{P}_{20!}, where we have set 20!=1 times 2 times cdots times 20.

For a function to be considered a direct proportion, the exponent of x must be a constant, and the coefficient of x (in this case, m+3) must not be equal to zero. Given the function y=(m+3)x^{m^2-8}, we can derive two conditions based on the definition of a direct proportion function:1. The coefficient of x, which is m+3, must not be equal to zero to ensure the function is defined for all x. This gives us the inequality:[m + 3 neq 0]2. The exponent of x, which is m^2 - 8, must be constant. Since the problem implies a direct proportion, we equate this exponent to 1 (a common choice for direct proportion functions), giving us the equation:[m^2 - 8 = 1]Solving the equation for m gives us:begin{align*}m^2 - 8 &= 1 m^2 &= 9 m &= pm 3end{align*}However, considering the condition m + 3 neq 0, if m = -3, this would violate the condition as it would make m + 3 = 0.

Define the Set ( A ):   Consider the set ( A ) defined by:   [   A = { n in mathbb{Z}^+ mid f(n) equiv 0 pmod{15} }   ]   where ( f(n) = nu_2(n) + 4nu_3(n) + 9nu_5(n) + 11nu_7(n) + 7nu_{11}(n) + 14nu_{13}(n) ).2.

The function ( f(n) ) is constructed such that it takes into account the exponents of the prime factors of ( n ) modulo 15.3. Uniqueness in ( {n, 2n, ldots, 15n} ):   For any positive integer ( n ), consider the set ( {n, 2n, 3n, ldots, 15n} ). We need to show that ( A cap {n, 2n, 3n, ldots, 15n} ) contains exactly one element. Since ( f(n) equiv 0 pmod{15} ) and ( f(n) ) is defined in terms of the exponents of the prime factors of ( n ), the function ( f ) ensures that exactly one of ( n, 2n, ldots, 15n ) will satisfy ( f(k) equiv 0 pmod{15} ).4. Existence of ( m ) and ( m+2018 ) in ( A ):   We need to show that there exist infinitely many positive integers ( m ) such that ( {m, m+2018} subset A ). This means both ( m ) and ( m+2018 ) must satisfy ( f(m) equiv 0 pmod{15} ) and ( f(m+2018) equiv 0 pmod{15} ).5. Choosing ( m ):   Consider ( m ) such that both ( m ) and ( m+2018 ) are not divisible by any of the primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. This ensures that the exponents ( nu_p(m) ) and ( nu_p(m+2018) ) are zero for these primes. Consequently, ( f(m) equiv 0 pmod{15} ) and ( f(m+2018) equiv 0 pmod{15} ).6.

Let (a, b, c) be three distinct positive integers such that the sum of the reciprocals of any two integers among them is an integral multiple of the reciprocal of the third integer. Without loss of generality (WLOG), assume (a > b > c).2. We claim that (a = 6), (b = 3), and (c = 2) is a solution. First, we verify that this set satisfies the given conditions:   - The sum of the reciprocals of (a) and (b) is (frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{6} + frac{2}{6} = frac{3}{6} = frac{1}{2}), which is an integral multiple of (frac{1}{2}).   - The sum of the reciprocals of (a) and (c) is (frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{6} + frac{3}{6} = frac{4}{6} = frac{2}{3}), which is an integral multiple of (frac{1}{3}).   - The sum of the reciprocals of (b) and (c) is (frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{2} = frac{2}{6} + frac{3}{6} = frac{5}{6}), which is an integral multiple of (frac{1}{6}).3. To prove our claim, we need to show that if ((a, b, c) neq (6, 3, 2)), then (a + b + c) is at least 12. Note that (6 + 3 + 2 = 11).4. Since (a > b > c), we have (frac{1}{a} < frac{1}{b} < frac{1}{c}). This implies (frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} < frac{2}{c}).5. Given that (frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b}) is an integral multiple of (frac{1}{c}), we can write:   [   frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} = k cdot frac{1}{c}   ]   for some integer (k). Since (frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} < frac{2}{c}), it follows that (k = 1), so:   [   frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} = frac{1}{c}   ]6. Consider the case (c = 2):   - If (b = 3), then (frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{2}). Solving for (a), we get:     [     frac{1}{a} = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{3} = frac{3 - 2}{6} = frac{1}{6} implies a = 6     ]     Thus, ((a, b, c) = (6, 3, 2)), which is our original solution.   - If (b = 4), then (frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{2}). Solving for (a), we get:     [     frac{1}{a} = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{4} = frac{2 - 1}{4} = frac{1}{4} implies a = 4     ]     This leads to (a = b = 4), which contradicts (a > b). Therefore, (b geq 5), implying (a geq 6). Thus, (a + b + c geq 6 + 5 + 2 = 13).7. Consider the case (c geq 3):   - Then (b geq 4) and (a geq 5). Therefore, (a + b + c geq 5 + 4 + 3 = 12).8. In both cases, if ((a, b, c) neq (6, 3, 2)), then (a + b + c geq 12).Thus, the smallest sum of three distinct positive integers satisfying the given conditions is (6 + 3 + 2 = 11).The final answer is (boxed{11})."},{"problem":"Find all functions f: mathbb{R} rightarrow mathbb{R} for whichf(x+y)=f(x-y)+f(f(1-x y))holds for all real numbers x and y.Answer: f(x) equiv 0.","solution":"Substituting y=0 gives f(x)=f(x)+f(f(1)), hence f(f(1))=0. Using this after substituting x=0 into the original equation gives f(y)=f(-y) for all y, i.e., f is even.Substituting x=1 into the original equation gives f(1+y)=f(1-y)+ f(f(1-y)). By f being even, also f(-1-y)=f(1-y)+f(f(1-y)). Hence f(f(1-y))=f(1-y-2)-f(1-y). As 1-y covers all real values, one can conclude thatf(f(z))=f(z-2)-f(z)for all real numbers z.Substituting -z for z into (4) and simplifying the terms by using that f is even, one obtains f(f(z))=f(z+2)-f(z). Together with (4), this impliesf(z+2)=f(z-2)for all real numbers z.Now taking y=2 in the original equation followed by applying (5) leads to f(f(1-2 x))=0 for all real x. As 1-2 x covers all real values, one can conclude thatf(f(z))=0for all real numbers z. Thus the original equation reduces tof(x+y)=f(x-y) .Taking x=y here gives f(2 x)=f(0), i.e., f is constant, as 2 x covers all real numbers.

Analyze the neighbors of ( x ):   - Each ( x_i ) (where ( 1 leq i leq 8 )) is acquainted with ( x ) and thus knows exactly 4 of the other ( x_j ) (where ( j neq i )).   - Since each ( x_i ) has 8 acquaintances in total, it must know exactly 3 of the ( y_j ).4. Count the pairs ((x_i, y_j)) where ( x_i ) knows ( y_j ):   - There are 8 vertices ( x_i ), each knowing 3 of the ( y_j ), giving a total of ( 8 times 3 = 24 ) pairs ((x_i, y_j)).5. Analyze the non-neighbors of ( x ):   - Each ( y_i ) (where ( 1 leq i leq n-9 )) is not acquainted with ( x ) and thus knows exactly 2 of the ( x_j ).   - Therefore, there are ( 2(n-9) ) pairs ((y_i, x_j)) where ( y_i ) knows ( x_j ).6.

Generalize the problem:   - For a general graph with ( n ) vertices, each of degree ( a ), where any two adjacent vertices have ( b ) common neighbors and any two non-adjacent vertices have ( c ) common neighbors, the formula for ( n ) is:     [     n = frac{a(a-b-1)}{c} + a + 1     ]   - This formula must yield an integer value for ( n ).9. Additional constraints:   - ( a ) and ( b ) cannot both be odd because the subgraph induced by the neighbors of any fixed vertex forms a ( b )-regular graph on ( a ) vertices.   - Similarly, ( n-a-1 ) and ( a-c ) cannot both be odd because the non-neighbors of any vertex form an ( (a-c) )-regular graph on ( n-a-1 ) vertices.The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 21 } )."},{"problem":"11. m, n are two natural numbers, satisfying 26019 times m-649 times n=118, then m= qquad , n= qquad _.","solution":"Analysis:Cancel 59 from both sides, the original equation becomes: 441 m-11 n=2Solving the equation gives: n=(441 m-2) / 11, when m=11 k+2, n=441 k+80Therefore, the minimum values are m=2, n=80, and m can be any natural number that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 11"},{"problem":"Given the line y=x+b intersects the ellipse frac{x^{2}}{2}+y^{2}=1 at two distinct points A and B.(1) Find the range of real number values for b.(2) When b=1, calculate | overset{→}{AB}| .","solution":"(1) Substitute y=x+b into frac{x^{2}}{2}+y^{2}=1 to eliminate y.

A natural number will be called magical if and only if it can be expressed as the sum of two three-digit numbers written with the same digits but in reverse order. For example, the number 1413 is magical because 1413=756+657; the smallest magical number is 202.a) Determine the number of all magical numbers.b) Show that the sum of all magical numbers is equal to 187000.","solution":"SOLUTION. Taking the number 1413 as an example, we see that it is not always easy to tell whether a given three- or four-digit number is magical or not. Therefore, let's first look at how a magical number x can be expressed using the digits of those three-digit numbers overline{a b c} and overline{c b a}, which are their sum:x=overline{a b c}+overline{c b a}=(100 a+10 b+c)+(100 c+10 b+a)=101(a+c)+20 b .We see that the number x is determined by the digits a, b, c in such a way that it depends only on b and on the sum a+c. This means that different triples of digits a, b, c can determine the same magical number x (we do not mean triples differing only by the mutual exchange of digits a and c). For example, if a+c=14 and b=9, we find three different representations of the magical number 1594:1594=599+995=698+896=797+797 .Are there any other \\"magical\\" representations of the number 1594? It all depends on whether the values of the sum of the digits s=a+c and the digit b are uniquely determined by the equation 1594=101 s+20 b. From the equation, we immediately see that the number s ends in the digit 4, so s=4 or s=14 (other values of the sum s=a+c are not achievable by the digits a, c). While the value s=14 corresponds (as we well know) to the value b=9, for s=4 we get the equation 1594=404+20 b, which has no integer solution.Encouraged by the above example, we will try to determine the number of magical numbers as the number of numbers of the form x=101 s+20 b, where the number s (equal to the sum of the digits a and c, which are non-zero) runs through the set {2,3,4, ldots, 18}, while the digit b runs through (independently of the sum s) the set {0,1,2, ldots, 9}. Since the number s takes 17 different values and the number b takes 10 different values, the number of all pairs (s, b) that we can substitute into the formula x=101 s+20 b is equal to the number 17 cdot 10=170. If we now show that by substituting any two different pairs left(s_{1}, b_{1}right) and left(s_{2}, b_{2}right) we get two different magical numbersx_{1}=101 s_{1}+20 b_{1} quad text { and } quad x_{2}=101 s_{2}+20 b_{2} text {, }it will mean that the number of all values of x (i.e., the number of all magical numbers) is also equal to the number 170.Suppose that for some pairs left(s_{1}, b_{1}right) and left(s_{2}, b_{2}right) we have x_{1}=x_{2}. The equation 101 s_{1}+ +20 b_{1}=101 s_{2}+20 b_{2} can be rearranged to the form 101left(s_{1}-s_{2}right)=20left(b_{2}-b_{1}right), from which, due to the coprimality of the numbers 20 and 101, it follows that the number b_{2}-b_{1} is a multiple of the number 101. It must be a zero multiple, since left|b_{2}-b_{1}right| leqq 9 ( b_{1} and b_{2} are digits!). Therefore, b_{2}-b_{1}=0, and thus also s_{1}-s_{2}=0, which together means that the pairs left(s_{1}, b_{1}right) and left(s_{2}, b_{2}right) are the same. Only in this case is the equality x_{1}=x_{2} possible.The sum of all magical numbers (i.e., numbers of the form x=101 s+20 b) can be conveniently determined by first arranging the numbers into a rectangular scheme (according to the same values of s in rows and according to the same values of b in columns)begin{array}{ccccc}101 cdot 2+20 cdot 0 & 101 cdot 2+20 cdot 1 & 101 cdot 2+20 cdot 2 & ldots & 101 cdot 2+20 cdot 9 101 cdot 3+20 cdot 0 & 101 cdot 3+20 cdot 1 & 101 cdot 3+20 cdot 2 & ldots & 101 cdot 3+20 cdot 9 101 cdot 4+20 cdot 0 & 101 cdot 4+20 cdot 1 & 101 cdot 4+20 cdot 2 & ldots & 101 cdot 4+20 cdot 9 vdots & vdots & vdots & ddots & vdots 101 cdot 17+20 cdot 0 & 101 cdot 17+20 cdot 1 & 101 cdot 17+20 cdot 2 & ldots & 101 cdot 17+20 cdot 9 101 cdot 18+20 cdot 0 & 101 cdot 18+20 cdot 1 & 101 cdot 18+20 cdot 2 & ldots & 101 cdot 18+20 cdot 9end{array}and then summing the numbers either by columns or by rows. We will opt for summing by columns, taking into account how much the numbers in the column under consideration differ from the corresponding numbers in the first column. The sum of the numbers in the first column is101 cdot(2+3+ldots+18)=101 cdot 170in the second column, the sum is 101 cdot 170+17 cdot 20 cdot 1, in the third 101 cdot 170+17 cdot 20 cdot 2, and so on up to the last (tenth) column, where the sum of the numbers is 101 cdot 170+17 cdot 20 cdot 9.

When k=2,  overrightarrow{b} = (overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b}) - overrightarrow{a} = (-1, 2),  thus overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = 2 times (-1) - 1 times 2 = 0,  which means overrightarrow{a} perp overrightarrow{b}.  If overrightarrow{a} perp overrightarrow{b},  then overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = 2 times (-1) - 1 times (k^2 - 2) = 0  implies k=0.

What is the maximum profit?","solution":" Step-by-Step Solution# Part 1: Cost of Each Helmet TypeLet's denote the cost of purchasing 1 type A helmet as x dollars and 1 type B helmet as y dollars.  Given the information, we can set up the following system of equations:  1. For 8 type A helmets and 6 type B helmets, the cost is 630: 8x + 6y = 630.2. For 6 type A helmets and 8 type B helmets, the cost is 700: 6x + 8y = 700.Solving this system of equations, we proceed as follows:- Multiply the first equation by 3 and the second by 2 to eliminate y:    24x + 18y = 1890    12x + 16y = 1400  - Subtract the second equation from the first to solve for x:    12x + 2y = 490 Rightarrow 12x = 490 - 2y- Substituting back into one of the original equations to find y, we find:    x = 30 and y = 65.Therefore, the cost to purchase 1 type A helmet is boxed{30} yuan and 1 type B helmet is boxed{65} yuan.# Part 2: Purchasing Plans for Maximum ProfitLet the number of type A helmets purchased be m, and thus (200 - m) will be the number of type B helmets purchased.

Calculate the angle bisector from (A) to (BC):   By the Angle Bisector Theorem, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides.

Understanding the condition frac{f(x_{1})-f(x_{2})}{x_{1}-x_{2}}<0: This implies that the slope of the line connecting any two points (x_1, f(x_1)) and (x_2, f(x_2)) on the graph of f(x) is negative, which means f(x) is a decreasing function on mathbb{R}.2. Analyzing the function f(x):   - For x geq 2, f(x) = (a-2)x. Since f(x) is decreasing, we need a - 2 < 0.   - For x < 2, f(x) = -frac{1}{8}x - frac{1}{2}. This part of the function is always decreasing because its slope is negative.3. Connecting the two parts of f(x) at x = 2:   - To ensure the entire function is decreasing, the slope of the first part (a-2)x at x = 2 must also be less than or equal to the slope of the second part at x = 2, which is -frac{1}{8}.   - Therefore, we set up the inequality 2(a - 2) leq -frac{1}{8} cdot 2 - frac{1}{2}.4.

Let each of the children say whether the color of their jacket is the same as that of the child to their left. We need to find out how many children will say \\"The same.\\"Let's find out how many children said \\"Different.\\" Note that if we go around the circle, the jacket colors of such children alternate. Indeed, if someone has a red jacket and their left neighbor has a blue one, then further on, there are several (possibly one) children in blue jackets until someone says that their left neighbor has a red jacket. Similarly, if someone has a blue jacket and their left neighbor has a red one. Therefore, among the children who said \\"Different,\\" there are an equal number of children in red and blue jackets. According to the problem, there are 12 children in red jackets. Thus, the total number of children who said \\"Different\\" is twice as many, i.e., 24. Therefore, the answer is 150 - 2 cdot 12 = 126.Solution II. We know that 12 children in blue jackets have a neighbor to their left dressed in a red jacket.

What do we need to find? We need to find the number of pairs of adjacent children whose jackets are of the same color, i.e., pairs RR and BB.The main observation for this solution is as follows: the total number of pairs BK and BB equals simply the number of children in blue jackets, since each of them has some neighbor to their right. If this neighbor is in a red jacket, we count them in pairs BK, and if they are in a blue jacket, we count them in pairs BB. So, let the total number of children in blue jackets be s. There are 12 pairs BK, so there are s - 12 pairs BB.Similarly, the total number of pairs BK and RR equals the number of children in red jackets. The number of children in red jackets is 150 - s, and there are 12 pairs BK, so there are 138 - s pairs RR.

Rewriting the Problem:   We are given the constraint:   [   x^2 + 2y^2 + 5z^2 = 22   ]   and we need to find the minimum value of:   [   M = xy - yz - zx   ]2. Using Symmetry:   Notice that changing ( z ) to ( -z ) leaves the constraint invariant. Therefore, we can equivalently study the function:   [   M = xy + xz + yz   ]   under the same constraint.3. Applying Lagrange Multipliers:   We introduce a Lagrange multiplier (lambda) and set up the system of equations:   [   nabla M = lambda nabla (x^2 + 2y^2 + 5z^2 - 22)   ]   This gives us the following equations:   [   y + z = lambda (2x)   ]   [   x + z = lambda (4y)   ]   [   x + y = lambda (10z)   ]   along with the constraint:   [   x^2 + 2y^2 + 5z^2 = 22   ]4. Solving the System:   Solving these equations simultaneously can be complex, but we can use the given solutions to verify the minimum value.

Now let (x, y) be a solution with x>0; without loss of generality confine attention to y>0. The equation rewritten as  2^{x}left(1+2^{x+1}right)=(y-1)(y+1) shows that the factors y-1 and y+1 are even, exactly one of them divisible by 4.

We're examining the relationship between \\"m parallel beta\\" and \\"alpha parallel beta\\".2. Analyzing \\"m parallel beta\\" implies \\"alpha parallel beta\\":   - If a line m within plane alpha is parallel to plane beta (m parallel beta), this by itself does not guarantee that plane alpha is also parallel to plane beta (alpha parallel beta). This is because it's possible for planes alpha and beta to intersect elsewhere. The only requirement for m parallel beta is that the line of intersection between alpha and beta, if it exists, is parallel to m.   - This shows that \\"m parallel beta\\" does not necessarily lead to \\"alpha parallel beta\\". Hence, it is not a sufficient condition.3. Analyzing \\"alpha parallel beta\\" implies \\"m parallel beta\\":   - If plane alpha is parallel to plane beta (alpha parallel beta), and line m is a subset of alpha (m subset alpha), then line m cannot intersect with plane beta. This is because alpha and beta being parallel means they do not intersect, and thus, no line in alpha can intersect with beta.   - This logically implies that if \\"alpha parallel beta\\", then any line m within alpha must also be parallel to beta (m parallel beta). Hence, \\"m parallel beta\\" is a necessary condition for \\"alpha parallel beta\\".4. Conclusion:   - Based on the analysis, \\"m parallel beta\\" is a necessary condition for \\"alpha parallel beta\\", because if alpha parallel beta, then m parallel beta must hold.

If a has an inverse modulo n, then we say that a is invertible modulo n.## Example 7.2 is its own inverse modulo 3 because 2 cdot 2=4 equiv 1 bmod 3.## Proposition 8.An integer a has an inverse modulo n if and only if a and n are coprime. The inverse of a is then unique modulo n.Proof. By Bézout's theorem, there exist integers u and v such that a u+n v=1 if and only if a and n are coprime. In this case, u is the inverse of a modulo n.To show uniqueness, suppose that b and b^{prime} are two inverses of a modulo n. We then haveb=b cdot 1 equiv bleft(a b^{prime}right) equiv(b a) b^{prime} equiv b^{prime}[n]Thus, b equiv b^{prime}[n], which proves the uniqueness modulo n.## 4 End-of-course training- Subject -"},{"problem":"For the quadratic equation in one variable x^{2}-6x+k=0, if one of the roots of the equation is x_{1}=2, find the value of k and the other root of the equation x_{2}.","solution":"Given the quadratic equation x^{2}-6x+k=0 and one of its roots x_{1}=2, we aim to find the value of k and the other root x_{2}.By Vieta's formulas, for a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots x_1 + x_2 = -frac{b}{a} and the product of the roots x_1 cdot x_2 = frac{c}{a}.

Indeed, if we consider a regular 2016-gon whose vertices alternate between red and blue, with a 2014th blue point somewhere else in the plane, then we need at least 2013 lines to properly separate the points: each arc of the circle defined by two of our points must be cut, and a line cuts at most two arcs.2) Let's show that 2013 is sufficient: note that for any pair of points of the same color A and B, we can draw two lines that separate them from the rest of the points, since it is enough to take two parallels on either side of (A B) sufficiently close to A and B so that no other point is in the region. Now consider the convex hull of our points, we distinguish two cases: If there is a red point on the convex hull, we can separate it from the rest of the points with a line, then pair the remaining red points to separate them as seen previously. Otherwise, there are only blue vertices on the convex hull, but then by taking two consecutive ones C and D, we can separate them from the rest of the points with a single line parallel to (C D) and close to C and D: this is the advantage of the convex hull. Then, we conclude as before with the remaining 2012 points: we pair the points, which gives us 2012/2 =1006 pairs, and we need 2 lines per pair, so we have a total of 2 times 1006+1=2013 lines.## 7 Counting/ Potpourri (Raphael)## “Sum”## Proposition 1.The size of the union of two sets is the sum of the size of each set minus the size of their intersection.

Based on this, if we denote the total number of points by x, the number of line segments is[frac{x(x-1)}{2} = 213 + 112 = 325]From this, we can only use the positive root: ( x = p + f + z = 26 ).Using this in (4), we get a single-variable cubic equation for p:[p(p-1)(26-p) = 1224]Each factor on the left side is a natural number, so we can look for the solution by factoring the right side into different bases. ( 1224 = 2^3 cdot 3^2 cdot 17 ), so one of the factors must be divisible by 17. Moreover, we see that ( p < 26 ), so the factor must be equal to 17. For ( p = 17 ) and ( p - 1 = 17 ), the value on the left side of (5) is not 1224, so the only value that fits for us is ( 26 - p = 17 ), which gives ( p = 9 ).Now we have ( f + z = 17 ), and combining this with (3), we can calculate f and z, and if these are natural numbers, we can also calculate F. However, we can see in advance that our answer cannot be unique, because the roots of the resulting quadratic equation, if integers, are different, since their sum is odd, and each root can be taken as f.From (3), ( f z = f(17 - f) = 60 ), so ( f = 5 ) or ( f = 12 ), and thus ( z = 12 ) or ( z = 5 ).

For example, to get the result ( p + f + z = 26 ), adding (1) and (3) gives that for ( p ), ( f ), and ( z ) each, the following cubic equation holds:[y^3 - 26 y^2 + 213 y - 540 = 0]The roots of this equation are 5, 9, and 12 (one of them can be found among the divisors of 540 by trial, and the other two can be obtained from a quadratic equation after removing this one), but from (4), only ( p = 9 ) gives integer values for ( f + z ).Several others, based on the factorization ( 540 = 2^2 cdot 3^3 cdot 5 ) in (3), tried, and based on (1), added that among ( p ), ( f ), and ( z ), two are odd, so the third is divisible by ( 2^2 )."},{"problem":"10.

Odd ( x ):   If ( x ) is odd, each term ( x^{2^k} + 1 ) (for ( k geq m )) is even because ( x^{2^k} ) is odd and adding 1 makes it even. Since there are an odd number of such terms, the product is divisible by ( 2^l ) where ( l ) is odd. This implies the product cannot be a perfect square because a perfect square must have an even power of 2 in its prime factorization.4. Even ( x ):   If ( x ) is even, each term ( x^{2^k} + 1 ) is odd because ( x^{2^k} ) is even and adding 1 makes it odd. Each term is relatively prime to each other because they are of the form ( x^{2^k} + 1 ) and ( x^{2^j} + 1 ) for different ( k ) and ( j ).

For this to be a perfect square, let:   [   x^{2^m} + 1 = k^2   ]   for some integer ( k ). This implies:   [   x^{2^m} = k^2 - 1 = (k-1)(k+1)   ]   Since ( x ) is even, ( x^{2^m} ) is a power of 2. The only way ( (k-1)(k+1) ) can be a power of 2 is if ( k-1 = 1 ) and ( k+1 = 3 ), giving ( k = 2 ).

This gives f(n) + f(-1) = f(n) f(0) + 2, from which we conclude that f(n)(1 - f(0)) is a constant. Since f(n) is not constant, it follows that f(0) = 1. From the same equation, we now get f(-1) = 2. Substitute m=n=-1, which gives f(-2) + f(0) = f(-1)^2 + 2, from which it follows that f(-2) = 5.

What is the minimum number of moves required to ensure that all cards are face down, regardless of the initial arrangement of the cards?","solution":"In n moves. First, we prove that all cards can always be placed face down in no more than n moves. If all cards are initially face down, the statement is proven. Otherwise, we divide the deck into groups of consecutive cards lying the same way (i.e., all cards in each group are either face up or face down). We flip the topmost group. This will reduce the number of groups by one. We will continue this procedure until only one group remains, i.e., all cards in the deck will lie the same way. Since there were initially no more than n groups, this will take no more than n-1 moves. The resulting group can, if necessary, be flipped in one move to ensure that all cards are face down. Now we show that there exists a card arrangement in which the required card layout in the deck cannot be achieved in fewer than n moves. Since each move, as is easily verified, reduces the number of groups by no more than one, a deck containing n groups can be reduced to one group in a minimum of n-1 moves. Consider a deck where the bottom card is face up, the second from the bottom is face down, and so on. If each move reduces the number of groups, the entire deck has not been flipped, so after n-1 moves, such a deck will be reduced to one group where all cards are face up (i.e., as the bottom card initially lay). Therefore, it will take an n-th move to flip all the cards and place them as required by the problem. If, in addition to the n-1 moves that reduce the number of groups, some moves are made that do not reduce the number of groups, then, obviously, a total of no fewer than n moves will be made.

Note since y(y-1) and left(y^{2}-y-1right) are consecutive integers, we see that left(y^{2}-y-1right) is coprime to both y and (y-1). Therefore the three factorsy^{2},(y-1) text { and }left(y^{2}-y-1right) text { are pairwise coprime. }Since their product is a perfect square it follows that either: one of y^{2},(y-1) and left(y^{2}-y-1right) is zero, or all three of them are perfect squares. So we have four cases:- Case A: y=0.Substituting this into the original equation yields (0)^{5}+2 x(0)=x^{2}+2(0)^{4}. Solving this quadratic yields x=1 and so (x, y)=(0,0) is the only solution in this case.- Case B: y=1.Substituting this into the original equation yields (1)^{5}+2 x(1)=x^{2}+2(1)^{4}. Solving this quadratic yields x=1 and so (x, y)=(1,1) is the only solution in this case.- Case C: y^{2}-y-12 then (y-1)^{2}=y^{2}-2 y+1<y^{2}-y-1<y^{2}. This would give us (y-1)^{2}<k^{2}<y^{2} which is a contradiction because (y-1)^{2} and y^{2} are consecutive squares.- If y<-1 then (-y)^{2}<y^{2}-y-1<y^{2}-2 y+1=(-y+1)^{2}. This would give us y^{2}<k^{2}<(y-1)^{2} which is a contradiction because (-y)^{2} and (-y+1)^{2} are consecutive squares.Therefore we must have -1 leq y leq 2.

Any explanation that we take the positive version of the number would suffice.)We next determine d_{2}. Let c^{prime} be the number to replace c by to make the sequence arithmetic. Then c^{prime}-b=b-a. Therefore, c^{prime}=2 b-a. Hence, we change c by c^{prime}-c=2 b-a-c.

Furthermore, B^{prime} is the midpoint of A C and B is the midpoint of A C^{prime}.Note that d_{1} is the distance between B and B^{prime} and d_{2} is the distance between C and C^{prime}. Consider triangle A C C^{prime}. Since B B^{prime}, C C^{prime} are both vertical, they are parallel. Therefore, triangle A B B^{prime} and triangle A C^{prime} C are similar, with ratio 1: 2.

Identify the tens and units digit relationship: We know that Zhou Yu's age at death is a two-digit number where the tens digit is three less than the units digit. If we let the tens digit be represented by x, then the units digit can be represented as x + 3.2. Equation setup: The poem also mentions that the units digit squared equals the symbol of longevity. This gives us a clue that the units digit, when squared, forms the age. However, to form the actual age, we need to consider the tens digit as well. Thus, the age can be represented as 10x + (x + 3), where 10x accounts for the tens place and (x + 3) for the units place.3. Form the equation: The units digit squared, which is (x + 3)^2, is equal to the age.

Given that f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y) for all x, y in mathbb{R}, we can start by looking at some special cases:   - If we let y = 0, then f(x+0) = f(x) + f(0) which simplifies to f(x) = f(x) + f(0).

Substituting this into the functional equation gives us f(x-x) = f(x) + f(-x), which simplifies to f(0) = f(x) + f(-x). Since we already determined that f(0) = 0, this implies that f(-x) = -f(x).      Therefore, the function f(x) is an odd function, as it satisfies the property f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in mathbb{R}.2.

Also, angle B=60^{circ}, and the area of triangle ABC is 3sqrt{3},  thus frac{1}{2} acsin B= frac{1}{2} acsin 60^{circ}=3sqrt{3}, which means frac{1}{2} times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ac=3sqrt{3}, so ac=12.  By the cosine rule b^{2}=a^{2}+c^{2}-2accos B, we get:  b^{2}=a^{2}+c^{2}-2accos 60^{circ}, which means b^{2}=(a+c)^{2}-3ac,  thus b^{2}=4b^{2}-3times12,  therefore b=2sqrt{3}.

Part (a)We need to determine if there exists a polynomial ( P(x) ) with integer coefficients such that ( P(d) = frac{2008}{d} ) for all positive divisors ( d ) of 2008.1. Identify the divisors of 2008:   [   2008 = 2^3 times 251   ]   The positive divisors of 2008 are ( 1, 2, 4, 8, 251, 502, 1004, 2008 ).2. Set up the condition for the polynomial:   For each divisor ( d ) of 2008, we need:   [   P(d) = frac{2008}{d}   ]3. Check the consistency of the polynomial:   Consider two distinct divisors ( a ) and ( b ) of 2008. We must have:   [   frac{P(a) - P(b)}{a - b} in mathbb{Z}   ]   Substituting ( P(a) = frac{2008}{a} ) and ( P(b) = frac{2008}{b} ), we get:   [   frac{frac{2008}{a} - frac{2008}{b}}{a - b} = frac{2008(b - a)}{ab(a - b)} = frac{2008}{ab} in mathbb{Z}   ]   This implies that for any distinct divisors ( a ) and ( b ) of 2008, ( ab ) must also be a divisor of 2008.4. Check if ( ab ) is a divisor of 2008 for all pairs of divisors:   - For ( a = 1 ) and ( b = 2 ), ( ab = 2 ), which is a divisor.   - For ( a = 1 ) and ( b = 4 ), ( ab = 4 ), which is a divisor.   - For ( a = 2 ) and ( b = 4 ), ( ab = 8 ), which is a divisor.   - For ( a = 2 ) and ( b = 251 ), ( ab = 502 ), which is a divisor.   - For ( a = 4 ) and ( b = 251 ), ( ab = 1004 ), which is a divisor.   - For ( a = 8 ) and ( b = 251 ), ( ab = 2008 ), which is a divisor.   Since ( ab ) is not always a divisor of 2008 for all pairs of divisors, there is no polynomial ( P(x) ) with integer coefficients that satisfies ( P(d) = frac{2008}{d} ) for all positive divisors ( d ) of 2008.

Since only one prime appears in the prime factorization of N and N is divisible by p, this prime must be p. Therefore, N=p^{q-1}. Similarly, we get M=q^{p-1}.We need to examine when the sum N+M=p^{q-1}+q^{p-1} is a five-digit number.

On the other hand, if 3 nmid n-1, let a_{1}=sqrt{2}, d=-frac{3}{2(n-1)} sqrt{2}, then each term in the arithmetic sequence is irrational, while a_{1}+2 a_{2}+cdots+n a_{n}=0 is a rational number.In summary, the set of positive integers n that satisfy the condition is left{n in mathbf{N}^{*} mid n equiv 1(bmod 3)right}."},{"problem":"9.3.
