He had his stroke last year. He has now difficulty in swallowing and everytime he eat and drinks he cough so much. After his lunch we gave him meds, a capsule it is called dr shultze, it helps him to soften his stool bec his having severe contipation.. after 15 mins of giving the capsule he is okay, no cough or anything then he drink water and started to cough, cough and cough until his eyes turns to red and he is sweating, he cough also the capsule but it breaks already.. my question is how he  cough it out the capsule if 20mins after he took.thank u so much Doc","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Difficulty in swallowing can occur due to stroke. This is common with strokes in medulla oblongata region of brain or strokes affecting both sides of brain. It takes at least about 30 minutes for the capsule to get digested, so, an undigested capsule may regurgitate with severe coughing from stomach. It may be a better idea to feed your grandfather through Ryle's tube (naso-gastric tube) to prevent aspiration pneumonia. Please get back if you require any additional information.

At first my levels were at 1300! They are now down to normal, however I have naturally lost around 20 pounds over this time. I take cabergoline 2 times per week 1/2 a pill.

Also I am a type 1 diabetic in good control.","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Prolactinoma with increased prolactin levels may be responsible for weight gain in some cases.

Anxiety disorders can manifest not only with psychological symptoms but with a variety of physical symptoms also like: Tingling, numbness, hot and cold sensations, palpitation, chest heaviness, choking sensation, poor sleep, tremors (shakiness) etc. It is better to get evaluated by psychiatrist and start treatment accordingly.

Dr said 2nd MRI showed in layman's term \\"an abscess\\" and had to be removed, along with other repairs to the discs.  Should I get a 2nd opionion?  Should this surgery be immediate?  Is there some form of biopsy that could be done to verify the MRI suspicion?","Doctor":"Dear friend, welcome to Healthcaremagic! I am Dr. Prasad Akole (Critical Care Expert-  and am glad to address to your query here. Your MRI shows discitis at lumbar 4 and 5 interspace- which means there is an inflamed inter-vertebral disc with swelling around. Most commonly it is from infection and if your doctor feels it matches the clinical picture of an abscess (pus collection), it is a threat to the spinal cord and nerves to get infected and vertebral spread and destruction. It needs to be tackled urgently. An abscess needs removal and debridement of the affected area. This may mean a surgical repair in your case. You may take a second opinion. A CT scan guided percutaneous needle aspiration of the pus may be done under local anaesthesia to just confirm the diagnosis and if pus is found, definitive surgery can be undertaken. I hope to have answered your query satisfactorily. I would be glad to answer any further queries. Take care and please keep me informed of your progress at  Good Luck!

There are two major forms:Limited systemic sclerosis/scleroderma involves cutaneous manifestations that mainly affect the hands, arms, and face. It was previously called CREST syndrome in reference to the following complications: Calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, Esophageal dysfunction, Sclerodactyly, and Telangiectasias. Additionally, pulmonary arterial hypertension may occur in up to one-third of patients and is the most serious complication for this form of scleroderma.Diffuse systemic sclerosis/scleroderma is rapidly progressing and affects a large area of the skin and one or more internal organs, frequently the kidneys, esophagus, heart, and lungs. This form of scleroderma can be quite disabling. There are no treatments for scleroderma itself, but individual organ system complications are treated. Immunosuppressants like steroids methotrexate ,mycept, azathioprine are used to suppress the immune mechanism .Since the disease also cause vasculitis of small vessels supplying nerves hence they can also have poly neuritis  which in turn produce pedal edemaContinue with Pregabalin and along with it she also requires methylcobal supplementsThe prognosis is generally good for limited cutaneous scleroderma patients who escape pulmonary complications, but is worse for those with the diffuse cutaneous disease, particularly in older age, and for males.Regards Dr Sandhya ManorenjNeurologist Hi tech city Hyderabad"},{"Patient":"Hi I am Chitra Saikhom looking for my mother where anybody can help me out actually doctor told me that she is suffering from DEMENTIA but what is the solution and medication should i give and if i explain about my mon she is not able to think,remember,forget what she need to speak,not able to stay alone scaring and she is noe 48 Age.

Please see MRI results below:At the C4-C5 level, a broad based disc osteophyte protrusion appears to be present far lateral to both the right and left and posteriorly extending 3 mm posteriorly and centrally with asymmetric compontents towards each nerve foramen greater on the right than the left of approximately 5 mm to the right. Severe right neural foraminal stenosis is noted with moderate left nerve foraminal stenosis the noted. Contact of the exiting nerve root on the right and left may be present. Anterior cord contact at this level may be present with mild to moderate central canal narrowing to approximately 9 mm.At the C5-C6 level, broad based disc osteophyte spurring is noted that may relate to a broad based disc osteophyte protrusion of approximately 3 mm centrally. Moderate to severe left neural foraminal stenosis is noted with moderate right neuroforaminal stenosis. The anterior thecal sac is thinned but the anterior cord is not obviously contacted. The exiting nerve roots may be affected bilaterally particularly on the left.At the C6-C7 level, a centralprotrusion is noted of 4 mm. Moderate left neural foraminal stenosis is noted with mild right neural foraminal stenosis noted. Mild central canal stenosis is noted with the central canal narrowed to 9 mm. Anterior cord contact may be present. This protrusion descends slightly centrally.My concern is no one has treated me & the pain is so severe that just going to pick up a few things at the grocery store puts me in a lot of pain. While trying to shop I have pain in my feet, hands, and backaches within 15 minutes on my feet.In addition I still work but am in constant pain. The pain in both hands, pins & needles in my buttocks, headaches and the most recent added symptom is dizzeness! When I get home I soak in hot water then go to bed to get relief!Should I be concerned that my doctors has not put me into therapy? Can I end up with permanent paralysis? What should I do now?Thank you.BD","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. After going through your MRI cervical spine report, it seems to suggest a moderate to severe degree disc prolapse at multiple levels with compression of the nerves at these levels. This could result in neck pain as well as arm pain. In addition to physiotherapy &neck exercises, I would advise you to use cervical collar (soft) and use medications such as pregabalin or gabapentin to reduce the nerve pain.

However, in view of your recent symptoms such as tinnitus (ringing in one year) and shin going numb, we need to exclude any pathology at cerebello-pontine ange, in the region of hearing or balancing nerve (vestibulo-cochlear nerve) of brain.

While diabetes is a frequent cause of neuropathy, it is not the only cause. Nutritional deficiencies (B-12 and folate), chemical exposures, pressure on nerves, or medications like chemotherapy medications etc. can also cause neuropathy. You must consult your doctor to find the exact cause of your problem. In case your symptoms are due to VIT B 12 deficiency or folate deficiency,injection NERVZ would help you but in case it is due to diabetic neuropathy,then it would not make any difference. You must then consult your doctor and get yourself tested for the presence of diabetic neuropathy. A variety of tests, including electromyography (a test that measures the response of muscles to electrical impulses) and nerve conduction studies (a study of the flow of electrical current through the nerves) combined with clinical observations may help a physician rule out other possible causes of pain and diagnose neuropathy. Although there has been considerable advances in the understanding behind the development of diabetic neuropathy but their treatment has been limited. Along with a meticulous and tight control of blood sugar levels,treatment is aimed at reducing pain and other associated symptoms. This is achieved by use of antidepressants like DULOXETIN ,use of anticonvulsant like PREGABALIN and a long acting opioid like TAPENTADOL.

Your MRI findings could mean a herniation of cerebellar tonsils. If you can upload your report, it would be helpful in confirming that. If it is mild, then there is no need to worry. However, if it is significant, then it may press on the lower part of brain (medulla) and upper spinal cord, leading to headache and neck pain.

We need to examine you in detail to come to a final conclusion regarding your diagnosis.

Central disc extrusion at T11-T12 causing central canal stenosis with mass effect on the spinal cord at this level.  Left paracentral disc protusion at L1-L2 causing mass effect on the left L2 nerve root.  Central disc protrusion at L5-S1 causing mild central canal stenosis. The disc abuts the descending S1 nerve roots. Diffuse disc bulge and facet arthropathy at L4-L5 causing mild central canal stenosis and mild right and moderate left neural foraminal narrowing.  Right paracentral disc protrusion at T12-L1 without spinal stenosis.","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query I understand your concern The MRI finding that you have described is suggestive of degenerative lumbar disc problem. Please note that the analysis of MRI data in these patients should always be correlated with the clinical data as MRI may overestimate the clinical findings. If the clinical findings are back pain alone, you just ignore these reports. If you have clinical deficits, documented by a neurologist you may have to review regarding the treatment options Best wishes"},{"Patient":"Can you please explain these MRI results: 1. C5-C6: Broad based disc osteophyte complex most prominent in the right subarticular with slight compression of the cervical spinal cord. Bilateral uncovertebral joint hypertrophy. Bilateral facet joint hpyertrophy. Mild central stenosis. Severe right and moderate left neural foraminal stenosis. 2. Multilevel cervical spondylosis.  Thank you!","Doctor":"Hi, The changes described are degenerative (related to aging and lifestyle). A disc osteophyte complex occurs when the intervertebral disc moves backwards (slip disc) and the adjacent bone enlarges to try and keep the disc in place. This leads to compression of the spinal cord and adjacent nerve roots which cause symptoms. Uncovertebral arthrosis and facet joitn hypertrophy simply represent degenerative arthritis of some of the joints in your cervical spine which may cause pain by itself or cause compression of your nerve roots. Formainal stenosis means that there is narrowing if the neural foramen which is the pathway through which your nerve roots pass. Treatment usually depends on your symptoms. If you have severe symptoms of nerve root compression (tingling or shooting pain along an arm, weakness of one hand, etc) you may need operative intervention. However, if pain is your only symptom, you may improve only with medication and physiotherapy. You need to meet an orthopedic surgeon to evaluate your problems and discuss various options. Sincerely, Vamshi"},{"Patient":"Lateral spine view: there is a 6-7 mm subluxation of l4 and l5. Narrowing of the disc space. Also narrowing of the l3 l4 space and minimal retrolisthesis of l3 with respect to l4 approx 5 mm.MRI recommended...would that show anything different than above?Can this cause my feet to be numb and sciatic area pain from buttocks to legs?What is usual treatment? What should I avoid doing? (until I talk to dr.)","Doctor":"Hi, Yes, an MRI would definitely be indicated in your case and you should probably get one done. X rays show only the bony abnormalities and do not tell us anything much about nerve root compression which is the cause of sciatica, numbness, weakness, etc. An MRI would give these details. Subluxation indicates movement of one vertebra over the adjacent (I'm assuming it is anterior subluxation of L4 over L5) and retrolisthesis means backward movement of the vertebra over the lower one (L3 over L4). These are usually due to break in the posterior vertebral portion (lysis) or due to facetal arthropathy, both of which are not mentioned in your X ray report. Subluxation/listhesis often leads to compression of nerve roots and needs to be operated if symptoms are severe. You would need to meet an orthopedic surgeon to discuss your options. Till then, avoid lifting heavy objects, doing heavy work, etc and wear a lumbar support (belt) if you have one. Sincerely, Vamshi"},{"Patient":"Every time I put a dip in my stomach starts to hurt and it causes me to go to the restroom almost always within 5 mins and my stool is never solid. I've been dipping for 2 years but only started having this happen for about 6 months. My stomach could be fine all day but for some reason once I put a dip in it always forces me to the restroom.","Doctor":"Hi ! Good afternoon. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.While answering your query, I would not leave this opportunity of counselling you to leave dipping without any pre condition or any delay. It is not necessary that because nothing happened for last two years, it would not happen now , just the same way as not necessarily high speed drivers commit severe accidents, but if they do, the chapter is over. All your present symptoms are due to the dipping, as it stimulates smooth muslces, and so causes intestinal hurry for going to wash room. This can also cause any kind of cancer you name as it consists of more than 300 cancer producing toxic chemicals in them. So my only advise is to leave it completely without any delay. You can seek the advice of your family physician on the effective ways to do it. Good luck."},{"Patient":"My sister suffered severe brain damage at age 26 ( major car wreck, head crushed, lost one eye and has a steel plate in her head and in a coma for 3 and 1/2 months and was not supposed to live.) and now is 85 yrs old. Her Dr's report says there is a very large area of encephalomalacia occupying most of the left hemisphere in the distributions of the left ACA AND MCA. A smaller area of encephalomalacia is present within the superior right frontal lobe.Healed right frontal craniotomy defect is present. I am and have been caring for her for years, she is very high maintenance. What does this all mean as for as brain damage?Her memory is fair; however, her logic is very poor to non existent.","Doctor":"Hi, Encephalomalacia refers to loss of normal brain tissue which is replaced by scar tissue which does not do the function of brain cells. Brain cells once dead do not normally regenerate and usually when one area of the brain is damaged, over a period of time the adjacent parts of the brain take over the functions lost. However, in your sister's case, the loss of brain tissue is very severe and one half of the brain has already nearly lost complete function. The other half is also affected. Overall, it is unlikely that her mental functions would improve a great deal at her age. Sincerely, Vamshi"},{"Patient":"Hi. I recently had an MRI brain scan without contrast and the radiologist saw 10-12 white lesions, many of which are located in the subcortical region. He described a \\"finger like projection\\" extending from the corpus callosum to a lateral ventrical. His findings were \\"while these findings are not completely typical of MS, it is included in the differential diagnosis along with Lyme's disease, vasculitis and small vessel ischemia\\". The radiologist did say the nu,ber of lesions were well beyond the normal for someone my age. I am a 44 y.o. female. Could the \\"finger like projection (lesion) be a Dawson's finger? Thank you for your time.","Doctor":"Hi, The diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis is a clinicoradiological one. It is very important to correlate the patients symptoms and signs with the MRI scan. Thus, a detailed neurologist examination would be essential before making such a diagnosis. Also, on MRI, modified McDonald's and Barkhof's criteria are applied before diagnosing MS and as per these two sets of criteria should be satisfied. In your case, 'dissemination in space' appears to have been satisfied but a repeat scan after 3 months (or this scan done after 30 days of symtpom onset) is needed to prove 'dissemination in time'. Dawson's fingers are classical in multiple sclerosis but we would need to see the scan to definitely say that the finger like projections described are definitely Dawson's fingers. There are several other causes of subcortical white matter signal abnormalities like those mentioned in your report. However, they may also be non-specific or age-related. The description in your scan fits that of Fazekas Grade 1 (lesions not confluent) changes which are of no significance or worry, especially if you are above 40-50 years of age. However, if they worsen on follow up MRI, especially in young patients (less than 40 years), it maybe an indicator for predisposition to development of dementia early in life. Overall, it is probably a good idea for you to take an expert neurologist opinion and get a repeat scan done in 3-6 months, before coming to any conclusion.

His violent behavior occurs in episodic pattern. As your doctor is suspecting any epileptic discharge on basis of EEG, it may be any epilepsy. Impulsive violent behavior is common in certain epilepsies. Other possibility is some mood disorder. Loss of interest, poor social interaction, violent behavior may be due to depressive episode. Third possibility is dementia. In dementia the changes on brain are non specific. In last stages decreased volume of brian may be observed.

However, the physician must be clear on what a patient means by \\"constant.\\" Some patients who say they have constant dizziness for months actually mean that they have a constant susceptibility to frequent episodic dizziness; this can be a vestibular problem. Headache, photophobia, and sonophobia suggest migrainous vertigo. Most patients with migrainous vertigo will also experience visual aura in at least some of their attacks.

On the 6th of April a CT scan of my face/head revealed an incidental finding of a 1.5 cm lesion in the cerebullar part of my brain. suspected it to be an arachnoid cyst. that wasnt the first CT scan I've ever had (sinus troubles as a kid) yet this was the first anyone ever told me about a cyst being in my brain!

I can't wait till Friday.  Thank you so much","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Based on the information you have provided, the most likely cause for the lesion in the cerebellum would be a post-inflammatory or post-infective lesion. An arachnoid cyst is normally present from birth, so, if it was not seen in your earlier scans, it is unlikely to be an arachnoid cyst. Similarly for glioma or a cancer to be cystic is quite rare. I would think you should wait and watch and repeat an MRI after 6-8 weeks to see the resolution or progression of the lesion, to decide about any surgery.

At first it was also in the calf and so we thought it was a calf strain plus nerve radiculopathy from my low back (I'm permanently disabled post 'failed back surgery syndrome' and nerve troubles). However, after the calf improved (6-7 months), I began to have the same problems in both the left AND right feet and ankles, radiating at times up to the right knee on the tibia and mid-tibia on the left. After seeing a second neurologist in February and getting prescribed Nuerontin and with no clearer diagnosis than it was somehow from the back (and no new testing), I began to question why for the past two weeks, it's not only been worse in the evening, but it can be bothering me a lot in the morning as well. I looked Perindopril (ACE inhibitor) that I'm on for hbp and saw that it's not a 'frequent', but a possible side effect - muscle weakness, tingling, numbness, etc. It made me ask my regular doctor to do a blood test for potassium level and she also wrote for me to have a Doppler test on the calf. However, the symptom that started this morning is what's concerning me. A regularly, pulsating, short 'throb' in the right calf. Feels like a heartbeat/small throb, but strong enough to be quite painful. I'm to have the blood test done tomorrow, but the Doppler not until Tuesday.

You took treatment form 10 years and remained seizure free for that period then suddenly you again had two episodes. This can happen even with drugs also. You CT is showing inflammatory granuloma. It may be due to granulomatous lesion caused by Neurocysticercosis or may be chronically healed Tubercular granuloma. This may be a cause of seizures. Eptoin is right drug for control of seizures but I would advise you to get yourself checked by a Neurologist. There may be additional need for some medicine for granuloma.

Both epidural injections as well as surgery are good options. However, the decision depends on the degree of disc prolapse and patient's symptoms. I know your doctor is the best judge, as they have examined you, but I would feel that surgery may be delayed by a few weeks, and injection given a chance first, as it is simpler and less invasive.

Both head and neck are throbbing but worse upon standing, upon sitting and even just trying to turn my head.  My neck is very stiff.  I have no fever.

However, since you do not have fever, the chance of the current episode being due to meningitis is very low. However, worsening of headache on standing could be suggestive of low pressure headache, which is caused by CSF leak, among other causes.

Millions of people like you are getting drug abusers after prescription of the pain-killers. In my practice, I have never seen withdrawal from 7 years of using opiates as a “cold turkey”.

Medically, it is called opioid-induced hyperalgesia or opioid-induced abnormal pain sensitivity. In my Ebook: Healthy pancreas, healthy you” in the part 3, I describe in detail the process of withdrawal. Fortunately, it is possible to get rid of fentanyl with supervision of the knowledgeable, experienced, licensed health practitioner. Usually, it takes 5-7 days, and it is not so miserable and relatively safe. I don’t believe in one approach.

Spasticity in lower limbs (legs) can occur due to a disease in corticospinal tracts, which extends from brain to the spinal cord. In your case, MRI of the thoracolumbar spine has been done and it is normal. However, we still need to examine the brain and cervical spine for any disease, as that too could cause spasticity of legs. Hence, your doctor has ordered for MRI of brain and cervical spine. CAT scan is not as sensitive and specific in finding out minor brain diseases or small lesions, hence it can not be relied upon 100%. I hope it helps. Please get back if you have any more queries.

I last got one 13 years ago when I was 18 and headed to college--MPSV4.  The shot I got today was MCV4, produced after 2005.Question(s):  Did this shot create some additional immunity?  Did it increase my chance of contracting a neurological side effect such as Guillain–Barré syndrome?  Would it cause some slight arm throbbing in the forearm/below the location of the shot?Thanks!","Doctor":"Hi and thanks for the query, The meningitis vaccine you take certainly created some degree of immunity, against the commonest germ that causes bacteria in adults. However, it does not exclude the fact you could still get meningitis from other strains of bacteria. The frequency of getting meningitis also depends on the individual s immune system. Lack of a chronic disease that reduces body s immunity renders possibility of infectious meningitis lower. Guillain Barre syndrome is a rare condition, seen in less than 1/100.000 population, and is generally associated to gastrointestinal infections due to some bacteria like Campylobacter jejuni. This ascending neurologic disease has been described with some vaccines, but in this case, your possibility of getting this syndrome is exceptionally very very low. However, you can watch out for signs like weakness of tingling at the levels of the limbs, in case you experience any of these, do not hesitate to contact your primary care physician. The pain or swelling after a vaccine shot might take up to a few days to get back to normal depending on the individual in question. More severe symptoms might be observed in some people.In this case, analgesics to reduce pain or fever if presence, in addition to Non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs are usually sufficient. thanks and best regards, Luchuo, MD."},{"Patient":"Hi.

Most of the times in epilepsy MRI report comes norma. MRI is advised only to rule of any serious pathological cause of seizures. Even in idiopathic seizures EEG comes normal during inter episode time. Eptoin is phenatoin and is a broad spectrum anti epileptic drug. It is a nice drug and it can control seizures effectively. Apart from taking drugs please follow following advise- - Never miss a dose of drug, if you miss a dose by chance then take it as soon as you remember missing it. - Fix a time for food, sleep. - Don't remain awake in late night. - Don't watch television from close distance, avoid bright lights in night. - Avoid loud DJ sounds. - For some time avoid driving alone. - Usually if you will remain seizure free on drugs for at least 3 years then gradual tapering of dose can be think of.

What does this mean? should we opt for biopsy or surgery. Is this really serious??thank youTammy","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. MRI report of your father-in-law is most likely indicative of a brain tumor. However, the exact type needs to be idetified to plan further treatment (total removal of tumor, radiation therapy , etc). The first step should be to do a brain biopsy of the lesion. This can be done by either stereotactic method (minor surgery) or open biopsy method (major surgery). Sometimes, if the tumor is big and is pressing on the vital brain structures, doctors may prefer an open surgery method so that the biopsy as well as tumor removal can be done in the same sitting.

She stopped her PD meds due to side effects she was having with them. thank you!","Doctor":"hi, thanks for writing to HCM, firstly i would like to advice you not to stop the Parkinson's disease medication without your doctors advice. For her present problem, i'll advice her to inhale steam for 10 mins 3 times a day. firstly as soon as she get up in the morning before eating anything, one time in the day and one time before go to sleep. As soon as her sputum tends to loosen up, cough out as much as possible. Also she should start doing some breathing exercises- like deep breathing exercises, huffing and coughing, chest expansion exercises. A physiotherapist can help her in all these exercises as well as in chest clearance. If all of this still doesn't help take the help of her exiting medical practitioner who is treating her for parkinsons.  Kindly do not delay a prompt action. i hope this helps wish her good health"},{"Patient":"hello m atit frm vadodara my grandpa is of  75 age he jus got a paralysis attack on right side of body due to a small clot in brain ..he has been atmiited  in icu since  dis sunday. he has daibitties n high blood pressure too..blood clot is not too big he is concious too..how much tym will it take to recover..will he b alright..??","Doctor":"Hello, Your grand father is suffering from stroke and reduction of, or disruption in, blood flow to the brain is the cause of a stroke. A stroke is usually defined as two types.. Ischemic (caused by a blockage in an artery) Hemorrhagic (caused by a tear in the artery's wall that produces bleeding into or around the brain) The consequences of a stroke, the type of functions affected, and the severity, depend on where in the brain it has occurred and the extent of the damage. Depending on the severity of the symptoms and how much of the body is involved, these impairments can affect the ability to walk, to rise from a chair, to feed oneself, to write or use a computer, to drive, and many other activities. Many stroke survivors recover functional independence after a stroke, but 25% are left with a minor disability and 40% experience moderate-to-severe disabilities. Once your grand father recovers,then he must control all his risk factors like diabetes and hypertension ,high lipids etc,because chances of recurrence of stroke is highest in next few months.

While i was suffering from Hepatitis, i was given glucose alot. Now doctors are saying the I have Neurocysticercosis (worm in brain), however I never felt that and never had any brain or head problem.","Doctor":"Hi and thanks for the query, Hepatitis and Neurocysticercosis have no relationship. Neurocisticercosis is a brain infection due to migration and scarification of  a worm in the brain. This infection is usually gotten from eating beef or pork meat, which most of the time is uncooked or not well cooked, causing the infection to be transmitted form the animal to man. This infection has different characteristics in different persons, and has different areas of predilection amongst different persons. I suggest it could be the brain in your case. symptoms like headaches and fits could be experienced in your case. I suggest you run some serological or blood tests for this infection which actually do exist for further confirmation and the opinion of a neurosurgeon or  neurologist could be worthwhile.

A X-ray spine cervico-thoracic showing that knot (both AP & LAT) view is required, and some blood tests- CBC, BLOOD SUGAR.

If the lesions have increased in size, a brain biopsy of the lesion may be done to find out the exact cause.

Laboratory reports have to be correlated with clinical findings to ascertain their significance. As of now, you do not have any features of goitre (as found by palpation of the neck region) or encephalopathy (altered consciouness, etc as assessed by the neuro). So, the TPO reports need observation and follow up and no action is needed at this stage. I hope it helps. Please get back if you require any additional information.

I have gone through the MRI brain reports of your husband. The most common condition, which can cause these findings, is migraine. In addition, we need to exclude a diagnosis of ischemia (lack of blood flow to brain).

Epilepsy (seizure disorder) is a chronic condition, and leads to repeated attacks of seizures. To prevent seizure reccurrence, anti-epileptic drugs are necessary. Encorate chrono (sodium valproate) is a very good and safe anti-epileptic drug. The dose depends on the patient's body weight. It is usually required for 3-5 years.

From your history its clear that you are suffering from increased heart beat called as tacchycardia . There are numerous causes for tacchycardia. The most commonest is because of anxiety. To know the exact cause please consult your doctor for ECG and ECHO,which will guide for proper diagnosis of the condition.

He is taking a walk of around 2-3 Km per day in morning he is also taking Physiotherapy.","Doctor":"Cerebral atrophy is a common feature of many of the diseases that affect the brain. Atrophy of any tissue means a decrement in the size of cells.Brain tissue atrophy i.e.cerebral atrophy describes a loss of neurons and the connections between the brain cells. Atrophy can be generalized, which means that all of the brain has shrunk; or it can be focal, affecting only a limited area of the brain and resulting in a decrease of the functions that area of the brain controls. Many diseases that cause cerebral atrophy are associated with progressive impairment of memory and intellectual function. Some of the common causes of stroke are:-- Stroke and traumatic brain injury Alzheimer's disease, Pick’s disease, Senile dementia (age related) Fronto-temporal dementia, and Vascular dementia     Infectious diseases, such as encephalitis, neurosyphilis, and AIDS, Epilepsy. Diabetes usually do not cause cerebral atrophy directly.It is the multiple tiny infarcts in brain that lead to cerebral atrophy.Diabetes and hypertension are risk factors for stroke or infarcts hence it leads to cerebral atrophy gradually. Mild cerebral atrophy can cause symptoms like mild memory loss,interfere with social and work skills,decreased ability to learn,seizures. There is no cure for cerebral atrophy. Once brain cells have been lost, the damage is permanent. Treatment for cerebral atrophy focuses on treating the symptoms and complications of cerebral atrophy. So it is important to keep blood pressure and sugar in control to avoid or slow down progression of cerebral atrophy further.Continue treatment with your neurologist with keeping things facts in mind.

Inadvertent CO poisoning likely causes around 500 deaths annually; the number of intentional CO poisonings is perhaps 10 times higher . The overall case-fatality rate for CO poisoning ranges from 0 to 31 percent . Unlike intentional poisoning, unintended poisoning demonstrates both seasonal and regional variation, and it is most common during the winter months in cold climates [5]. Morbidity, which is primarily related to late neurocognitive impairment, persists beyond initial stabilization in up to 40 percent of victims. Smoke inhalation is responsible for most inadvertent cases of CO poisoning. Other potential sources on, improperly vented fuel-burning devices (eg, kerosene heaters, charcoal grills, camping stoves [8], gasoline-powered electrical generators [9]), and motor vehicles operating in poorly ventilated areas (eg, ice rinks, warehouses, parking garages). CO poisonings following open air exposure to motorboat exhaust have also been reported [10]. In addition, underground electrical cable fires produce large amounts of CO, which can seep into adjacent buildings and homes [11]. An increase in carbon monoxide exposures has been reported to occur in the immediate aftermath of hurricanes [9,12,13]. advice plz shift your gas heater outside your washroom and there is no term like hot water epilepsy..carbonmonooxide does causes late neurological disturbance..but they ususally reside month or so...no use of taking levicitream.... take care"},{"Patient":"an MRI showed I had 1)-radia tear of the free edge of the body of the medial meniscus 2) acute grade 1 sprain superimosed on chornic sprain in the MCL 3)moderate-sized knee joint effusion 4)-degenerative chondrosis/articular cartilage fraying in teh medial compartment can you translate into simple work what that means and i was told by the doctor i needed surgery, do you agree?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for posting your query.

It just feels as if I m being pulled down by gravity. yhe heaviness has not gottem any better yet. What can this possibly be?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for posting your query. dizziness, nausea, and heaviness suggest inner ear infection (labyrinthitis).It can be bacterial or viral.Symptoms of labyrinthitis begin quickly and can be quite intense for several days. After that, they usually begin to fade, but continue to surface when you move your head suddenly. other conditions like migraine,small stroke and Menieres syndrome should also be ruled out. Avoid any stress and anxiety. Contact your doctor and get test like hearing test, CT or MRI, EEG and blood test to be sure and rule out diseases. Hope it helps.

The pain began intermittently about 1 and 1/2 yrs ago.  I went to the doctor and they completed an ultrasound of my abdomen and also an EGD.  No findings of gallbladder stones, etc.  Since that time I have had instances of pain in the same area (upper right side) - sometimes after meals but not consistent until about 5 weeks ago.  I went to the urgent care and they ordered a HIDA scan.  I did not have the test at that time because morphine used in the test makes me sick.  Four weeks later the pain was acute and I went to the ER.  They did another abdominal ultrasound - no stones.  I did follow-up with my doc who ordered the HIDA scan - had it done and no stones.  I also had a CT and another EGD and colonoscopy - no stones but the pain now is every day.  I have an appt with a surgeon on Monday only because I have become my own advocate for help - the pain is there and they have dismissed it as gastroenteritis - I have had GERDs for the past 10 yrs and it is much worse now with the pain on the right side.  The doc who completed the colonoscopy prescribed a drug for cramping after but also prescribed Amitriptyline???   Let's be clear, I am not depressed.  Yes, for the past 2 weeks that they have been trying to diagnosis this pain, it has been rough, but why would they prescribe this drug?  It is so frustrating to be in pain daily and then because they cannot seem to figure it out, they think that I must be depressed??  I am hopeful that the surgeon will either order an MRI to more precisely diagnosis what is going on, or take out the gallbladder.  Your thoughts?","Doctor":"Thanks for coming to Health care Magic.I understand your concerns of pain with no apparent cause diagnosed and repeated testing is making you frustrated. Doctors sometimes prescribe Amitriptyline for pain and for functional causes. Lets leave that aside and focus on your pain issue.You have mentioned that you have GERD, what treatment are you taking for that? Also, you indicated the link of pain with meals, can you please tell us more about this pattern (in how much time after meals does pain start, location of start, does the pain radiate/move/spread anywhere, duration it lasts, what makes it better, any link with particular food items). Also, did you notice any link of pain with cough/deep breathing? Does the pain increase on pressing the area or increase after taking-off hand pressure? How is your bowel movement pattern? If you got stool analysis done, please share reports with us.In upper gastroscopy, how was the mucosa status ? In colonoscopy, did they find any diverticuli? I am asking details of these questions to understand your condition better so that we can help you.If you have not visited your surgeon yet, I would suggest to wait and avoid any further testing while you share the above details about your pain and test reports. But in case of severe pain, please visit emergency. Gall bladder removal might not solve your problems rightaway and every surgery (open or laproscopic) comes with its side effects; I would recommend avoiding it till the cause is clear.Hope you get better soon."},{"Patient":"I have been seeing doctors for almost a year.

Any pathology in the vestibular apparatus in inner ear (it is associated with maintenance of body posture & balance) 2. Any fluctuation in blood pressure levels such as Hypotension. 3.

Tension/stress & lack of adequate rest and sleep. Investigations like complete blood count, estimation of blood pressure and blood sugar levels will be helpful in clinching the diagnosis. A CT scan of brain might be required to rule out any pathology. So, it will be better to consult your General Physician & get a proper physical examination done.

Please can you tell me ways that can help me relax and get back to normal as it is affecting my university studies as some days I feel too vulnerable to leave the house","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to Health Care Magic Usually panic episode occurs for a brief duration only. The symptoms you have described lasted for about 4 days so most probably those symptoms were of Generalized Anxiety. After that episode you have become more and more emotional, you have crying spells, difficulty in sleeping, electric shock like sensations in body. These symptoms are part of Anxiety and Mild Depressive Episode. I will advise you to please visit your Psychiatrist and take opinion regarding proper medicines. Relaxation will help but as symptoms are bothering you proper evaluation by Psychiatrist is must. Cognitive Behavior Therapy helps a lot in such symptoms.

He is not very sure.","Doctor":"Hello, The symptoms which you have described for him do not appear to be those of seizure. I am not sure what is the constituent medication in Lapitor but most likely it is one of the anti epileptic drug and in that case he should continue on that. I will not be worried about the episode that he had in night. Probably you may be more watchful and be alert for any such episodes in future. If these persist he may be evaluated later for them.

Your symptoms require further evaluation to establish the diagnosis. Possibilties include presyncope/syncope, vertiginous epilepsy, and migrainous vertigo.

Foot drop can be due to disc prolapse at L4-5 level also, if the compression of the nerve there is severe. However, in this case, we expect a sharp, shooting pain from low back to the foot region.

Lightheadedness can lead to falls and other injuries. Protect yourself from injury if you feel lightheaded: Lie down for a minute or two. This will allow more blood to flow to your brain. After lying down, sit up slowly and remain sitting for 1 to 2 minutes before slowly standing up. Rest. It is not unusual to develop lightheadedness during some viral illnesses, such as a cold or the flu. Resting will help prevent attacks of lightheadedness. Do not drive a motor vehicle, operate equipment, or climb on a ladder while you are dizzy. Do not use substances that can affect your circulation, including caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, and illegal drugs. Do not get dehydrated, which can cause or increase lightheadedness, when you have an illness that causes diarrhea, vomiting, or a fever. Drink more fluids, especially water. Other fluids are also helpful, such as fruit juice mixed to half-strength with water, rehydration drinks, weak tea with sugar, clear broth, and gelatin dessert. If you have another medical condition, such as kidney disease or heart disease, that limits the amount of fluids you are allowed to have, do not drink more than this amount without first talking to your doctor. If you have vertigo: Do not lie flat on your back. Prop yourself up slightly to relieve the spinning sensation. Move slowly to avoid the risk of falling.

Most strokes are ischemic (usually due to blockage of an artery), but some are hemorrhagic (due to rupture of an artery). Transient ischemic attacks resemble ischemic strokes except the symptoms resolve within 1 hour. Recovery after a stroke depends on many factors, such as the location and amount of damage, the person's age, and the presence of other disorders. Controlling high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, and high blood sugar levels help prevent strokes. Treatment may include drugs to make blood less likely to clot or to break up clots and sometimes surgery.Lenses, special prisms and Optometric Vision Therapy/Orthoptics are often combined to restore Vision.

Doctors of our place are unable to find diagnosis and she had several medicine relating stomach, colon, antibiotics, anxiety but no use at all. so plz tell me your comment and recommendation if you have any clue regarding this unknown disease.","Doctor":"Hello,Actually, it is very difficult to find the cause for Ulcerative Colitis.We have looked hard to find either an infection or something in the diet that might be causing the disease, but have drawn a blank.For a while it seemed that Ulcerative colitis might be one of those diseases where the body seemed to be attacking itself.We now think that very unlikely, but there is no doubt that something must be causing damage to the lining of the large intestine.As the cause is still not identified, there is no cure for this disease.All treatments available at present are directed towards reducing the amount of inflammation in the bowel.Fortunately, for most patients with Ulcerative colitis, medicines prove effective although it is possible that your treatment may need to be varied to find the drugs that work best for her.We firstly try to find a treatment that will bring the disease under control. Then they will work on finding a treatment to keep her that way.Almost always, the choice of treatment will depend on the extent and severity of the inflammation within the large bowel.If the inflammation is confined to the rectum (‘proctitis’), it is quite possible we will recommend a medication that she will need to insert into the rectum through the back passage.Although the thought of this can be unpleasant, it can be helpful to appreciate that giving your treatment this way does mean that the therapy is really directed right against the inflamed part of your bowel.Treatment can be given as suppositories or as enemas.Enemas can also be useful if the disease involves more of the large bowel than just the rectum alone, but if the inflammation in the bowel is extensive enough to affect more than half of the colon, it is also likely that she will be prescribed tablets to take by mouth.Aminosalicylates are helpful and may reduce cancer risk. We try to avoid giving steroids in the long term because of side-effects.As an alternative, the possibility of taking azathioprine may be discussed with her.This calms down the immune system and, although only weakly effective against active disease, it has proved most useful in preventing relapses.This drug does need close monitoring in the first few weeks of treatment in order to detect side-effects although most people do not have any problems when they take it.Hope this helps.Please write back for further queries.Wishing you good health."},{"Patient":"I have a question I am 23 years old and all my life I have had head aches and bloody noses. have had a spinal tap done when i was 14 they said it came back ok.

I don t know what to do right now I m having bad pains on left side of my head and back of head my jaw hurts all the way down my neck . Any idea what it could be?","Doctor":"hi, (A) The NECK PAINS may be associated with some nerve impingement, may be some cervical vertebra inflamation/swelling due to repeated friction , MRI would be helpful to get it checked. (B) NOSE BLEED - nose bleed is mostly occurs due to the nasal mucosa (inner surface of nose) gets dry mostly from the winter, trauma to the nose triggers a nosebleed. Trauma to the outside of the nose, such as a blow to the face, or trauma inside the nose, such as nose picking. Rarely : Some anticoagulant drugs like coumadin may be the cause , some bleeding disorder may be the cause like low platelet count but this rare things are dumped down in your case since the blood test and CSF were normal , So for nosebleed stop picking and when ever it bleed you can put a cotton gauge and can be stopped by pressure. (C) There are different type of HEADACHES as below and I will try to explain it in simple terms 1) MIGRAINE - its a head ache which most has some kind of prodrome (factor/symptoms/feeling) which indicates the person that he will be going to have headache soon, mostly people say some kind of aura like lights/ nausea kind of feeling is mostly precedes the onset of headache 2) CLUSTER HEADACHE:- its a headache which is associated with watering in eyes/ nose , pain in eyes , pain associate with some intense light exposure like headache,Sweaty, pale skin (pallor) on the face, one sided headache may be on right or left side. 3) TENSION HEADACHE:- its a headache with band like headache means the hurting area seems like some has tied a band around the head and is very tight. Mostly from the description it seems like a \\"CLUSTER HEADACHE\\" Now following are the cause that can lead to this kind of headache and needs to checked. Headache NORMALLY DO NOT have any UNDERLYING DISEASE (90% case have no issues), BUT in 10% cases headaches may occasionally indicate a serious underlying medical condition, a) brain tumor or b) rupture of a weakened blood vessel (aneurysm) Well the best thing is to attain a piece of mind, and for that ADVICE: Consult NEUROLOGIST (brain doctor) Here is mostly they will do 1) do physical exam 2) will probably ask for MRI SCAN OF BRAIN, 3) If nothing serious mostly 90% of case are with out danger they will give pain medications that is special for the type of cause (e.g- sumatraptin for migranes , so it will be different from normal over the counter medication (available with out prescription) like ibuprofen) so necessary to consult the physician PLEASE do not be scared , there are 90% of headache and have no issue with any kind of brain problems but for the sake of safety and piece of mind MRI / CT Will be need.

When pathologic, they could be intention tremors, which set in only when one has to take something or resting tremors. Depending on the particular characteristics of the tremors and the age, the diagnosis becomes very different. The sensation you are feeling like pins is generally called a peripheral neuropathy.

This may happen because of Epilepsy, Syncope attack or some vertigo. But as every blood investigation is normal, BP, ENT and heart is also normal so possibility of epilepsy is high.

Your seizures were triggered by aspartame and for long time you didn't experience any seizure. I will advise you to visit your doctor and get EEG of brain done. It may detect abnormal electrical phenomenon happening if any. Second it may be due to some some anxiety, due to anxiety individual may have features mimicking aura. So go to your doctor for proper evaluation. Thanks Dr. Seikhoo Bishnoi"},{"Patient":"I have unexplained severe tremors & have been to a neurologist to be tested for seizures where I was cleared for anything related to this. Everything was normal on EEG & MRI so nothing in the neuro department. Dr. suggested I see cardiologist as I have also had a couple of unexplained episodes of syncope . Not sure whether the two are related but both have happened while driving. One episode of syncope caused a traumatic car accident & I m thankful to walk away from it & no one was injured. Therefore, I m hoping you can provide me with some type of answer.","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Based on the symptoms, the two possible diagnoses are still seizures and syncope. I should clarify that seizures are a clinical diagnosis and not purely based on the EEG and MRI findings. EEG may be normal in about 50% of cases of seizures. MRI of brain may also be normal in many cases of seizures. So, my suggestion would be to see a cardiologist to evaluate for syncope. If that is normal, then, an empirical course of anti epileptic drugs may be used.

She was confused and dazed after the fall. She didn t recognize one of her grandsons. She was admitted to the hospital and they put her in an induced coma and on a ventilator. We were told that the x-rays/ MRI scan showed that bleeding on her brain was not as bad as they thought. She ended up having 2 seizures when they attempted to take ventilator out. They did give her some kind of seizure medicine as well. They took her off the drugs for induced coma 3 days ago and she still has not awakened. She does move her toes from time to time when we talk to her but nothing else. How long does it take to awaken after something like? I do understand that she may have injured her brain more severe then they are saying but is this unusual? Please help...any kind of assistance is appreciated..Thanks","Doctor":"Hi, Usually patients with sedation on board tend to wake up anywhere from few hours to 72 hours after taking the sedation off. However, in the elderly this can be more delayed. Further, the anti-seizure medications that were given also cause sedation and could be delaying her waking up. However, all this depends on where exactly she has bled and whether there is and bruising of the brain itself. With the initial CT scan what the doctors meant when they said the bleeding was not as bad as they though must have been that they expected a bigger clot that would have needed surgery. Howver, how much injury the brain itself would have sustained, only time will tell and follow-up scans can throw some light on it. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Sir, I had developed Seizure when i was 5yrs old from fever and initially started with Zarontine syrup and later with Epilex.

As you have recently suffered jerks and mild seizure even on 1000 mg valporate so dose increase was must. Now you are on 1200 mg of drug. Sodium Valporate is a safe drug and usual side effects are nausea, vomiting, weight gain, dizziness, curling of hair, in some males hair loss, and decreased platelet counts. But as you were on 1000 mg and just 200 mg is increased the chances of side effects are very low. The drug is must for your seizures so continue with the drug.

Im just worried this lymph node will not go away and I dont want to wait till it goes down to and later find out its something else.","Doctor":"When lymph nodes swell in two or more areas of the body, it is called generalized lymphadenopathy. This may be caused by: A viral illness, such as measles, rubella, chickenpox (varicella), or mumps. Mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr virus), which results in fever, sore throat, and fatigue, or cytomegalovirus (CMV), a viral infection that causes symptoms similar to those of mononucleosis. A bacterial illness, such as strep throat (caused by the streptococcus bacterium) or Lyme disease (a bacterial infection spread by certain types of ticks). Side effects of phenytoin (Dilantin), a medicine used to prevent seizures. Side effects of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination. Cancer, such as leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which develops after contracting HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).

Has there been a recurrence of acoustic neuroma? This can be answered with an MRI scan of brain with contrast. If yes, then, it could cause those symptoms. 2. What was the cause of fall? Was it a seizure or syncope? This needs to be sorted out, in consultation with a cardiologist and neurologist. 3. How is the blood flow of the brain, as per your neurologist assessment?

My question is howl long it will take to recover from the bowel and bladder problem, and is he willing to recover? what is required to do, to speed the recovery.","Doctor":"Thank you for posting the query. It is unfortunate that your brother had a spinal cord injury leading to disability. The extent and time for recovery depend on the severity of injury as well as how early after the injury the surgery was performed. In cases of mild to moderate spinal cord damage, complete recovery may occur. However, if severe injury had occurred, recovery may not be complete. Similarly, if operation was performed within 24 hours of injury, there are good chances of recovery. Most important to ensure good recovery is regular physiotherapy. Stem cell treatment may offer much promise in future for patients with spinal cord injury.

Kindly enlighten us in this regard & oblige. Thanking you, Yours sincerely, Mr.J.Y.Martin","Doctor":"Hello Mr. Martin Welcome to Health Care Magic The symptomatology you have described are trouble in speech, and forgetting things etc. This may be due to two reasons- One thing is post trauma sequel. After head trauma to head patients may develop forgetfulness, memory impairment, irritability, mood swings etc. But to confirm this you have to get MR scan of your wife done to find any significant lesion if any. Other possibility is Dementia due to age, or Alzheimer's disease. As Alzheimer's disease may present with symptoms like forgetfulness, change in behavior, irritability and other cognitive dysfunctions. As she is 61 and also she is having the history of trauma to head, most likely her symptomatology is due to Alzheimer's dementia. I will advise you to take her to a good Psychiatrist and get her evaluation done. Tests like Mini Mental Status Examination can be applied to her to check for cognitive decline.

Concerned sister AAAA","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. The prognosis of a benign tumor of pituitary is quite good. So, if you have gone through the biopsy report of the tumor, and it is benign, then the chances of long term survival is quite good. There could be mild decline in her memory and cognitive functions due to her tumor and radiotherapy. However, we should investigate whether she has any other reasons for the same. This would include checking for vitamin B12 deficiency, thyroid dysfunction, etc. Proper treatment of her dementia would help her recover to an extent.

She is fine now. But She is having tasteless tongue . Whatever food she takes in, she feels like vomiting . At present, she is just having bread, biscuits, liquids, fruits & puddings. Kindly suggest remedy for this. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. First of all, it is good to note that your mother in law is recovering well after a brain stroke. Tasteless tongue is unlikely to be related to blood clot in brain. However, if you can upload the CT or MRI brain report, it would be helpful. Taste involvement can also be due to side effects of certain medications, such as antibiotics (metronidazole), iron, etc. So, if you can send a list of medications your mother in law is taking currently, it would help.

As you have been cured of it, no further treatment for tuberculosis is needed. In case, you are taking anti-epilepsy medicine, they can be discontinued gradually after seizure free period of 2-3 years.

I can understand your discomfort regarding Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment and prognosis. First of all, I would like to reassure you that both Government and pharma companies are spending a lot of money to find treatment and cure for AD. However, real success has not been achieved.

I agree with you that your diagnosis has not been established, as different doctors disagree. MS (multiple sclerosis) can be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, MRI findings and CSF (spinal tap) analysis. EEG is not helpful in the diagnosis of MS. Increased electrical activity in EEG can also occur in about 5% of normal population. So this finding without any history of seizure is not significant and no medications are needed for this purpose.

Recently I been having respiratory problems with my breathing . Lost 4 lbs since friday. been to the doctors constantly. Havent seen my neurologist in a few months. I have been feeling this twitching/weird feeling in my thighs mainly sometimes recently near my elbows it comes and goes. I am concerned of it being ALS. I constantly do research on it. It does nothing but give me bad anxiety . I am being treated for that too. I am on 6 different medications right now. Been feeling dizzy and when I am up and about doing things i get shortness of breath very easily. I don t know what to think because sometimes i do overreact about things and maybe i am paying attention to closely to my body. But then again I don t think I am. I had a MRI on my brain back in November which came back good. I can walk fine, pick things up. Please let me know what you think.","Doctor":"Hello riggs.kimberiya Welcome to HCM Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy is a type of seizure that is mainly characterized by Sudden onset jerky movements of extremities. The twitching movements you are having in thighs or elbows might be due to the electrical activity in these area. So don't be anxious as in Amyotropihic Lateral Sclerosis although sudden onset fasciculations are seen, but weakness of limb and atrophy is main presenting feature, fasciculations are observed but in latter course. Other symptoms like difficulty in walking, holding things are seen more often. As you have mentioned that you are having just twitching movements and I assume that there is no weakness or atrophy, there is very less chances of ALS. Regarding anxiety, it may occur due to seizure itself, due to anti epileptic drugs. so if you have still any doubt then visit a good neurologist for expert opinion.

Normally children or toddlers knocking their heads often results to just a small bump with nothing serious on the head, but since your son developed a fever and vomiting some few hours later, I suggest that he gets examined by a doctor soonest. CT scan might be more or less necessary (but could be included). The toddler might be suffering from an intracranial hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage due to the fall. His presenting symptoms could just be as a result of a small malaise.

First of all, I would like to reassure you that your MRI findings do not suggest any serious neurological problem. It shows mild cervical spondylosis with bulging of discs (soft tissues located between the vertebral bones), which is pressing the nerves there. For this, you would need to do physiotherapy, including neck exercises. Regarding tonsillar ectopia- a small part of brain at the back-cerebellum, is coming down behind the spinal cord.

Oh, and uhh... got any ideas what s wrong with me?","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Numbness of face denotes involvement of the Trigeminal nerve, that emerges from brainstem area of the brain. At age 30, demyelinating illnesses such as multiple sclerosis is more common. Stroke as you suggested is uncommon at this age. Numbness can also be due to mechanical pressure over the nerves of skin over the affected area. For confirmation of diagnosis, you would need an MRI scan of the brain. Please consult a neurologist for detailed evaluation.

It is reassuring to note that your doctor feels surgery is not required, which means the nerve compression is not severe. For nerve pain and tingling, medications such as pregabalin or gabapentin are useful.

Her eye no. has been changed and doctor said there is onset of cataract . She is on Vertin 16, twice a day. She has undergone the positional vertigo exercise too, but no relief from it. Please suggest any treatment. Thanks","Doctor":"Thanks for your query,    Change your position slowly, especially when going from a lying or sitting position to a standing position. When you get out of bed, sit on the side of the bed for a few seconds to gain your orientation and allow your circulatory system to adjust. When walking, focus on distant objects. Do not look down at your feet. Avoid walking in dark areas or on unstable ground. Falls at home occur when the floor covering changes from carpet to tile or linoleum. When riding in a car, try to sit in the front seat. Look out the window at a fixed point. When going around curves, look at a distant object beyond the curve. Make certain eye glass and hearing aid prescriptions are current. Use a cane, walking stick, or walker for support and to give additional pressure and touch (tactile) orientation. Avoid activities that move the head up and down repetitively. Try to avoid keeping the head tilted back for long periods of time, for example painting or dusting above your head. Be cautious when using medications that may cause balance problems as a side effect. If a person is having an episode of vertigo, he/she should not drive or operate machinery until their doctor says it is safe to do so. People who are subject to sudden instances of vertigo should also avoid climbing ladders or participate in other situations that may be dangerous to themselves or others (for example, hiking alone or taking care of children), should they suddenly feel an episode of vertigo coming on. wishing you good health. regards, Dr.sharmila"},{"Patient":"1Hi Doctor - I feel heaviness and feeling of swelling in my head.

This MRI was done to try to identify why I am having continued loss of strength, coordination, and motor skills, in my right arm and hand along with cramping of my hand and my hand getting cold all the time. No other conditions exsist. I am trying to find out what microvascular ischemic gilosis is or means Thank you YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hello jefdebb Thanks for your query, welcome to HCM microvascular ischaemic gliosis on brain are incidental findings on brain which are we can say in simple terms, are micro scars, it may occur due to advancing age, in persons of hypertension, in athersoclerosis. Usually they don't have any clinical significance. The continued loss of strength, coordination and motor skills on hand and arms may be due to a number of causes- - either vitamin B complex deficiency - due to neuropathy on particular area. - as a part of psychosomatic illness So be assured there is no problem in your MR scan, still for clinical improvement visit a good psychiatrist or neurologist. Hope I cleared your doubt. Take Care"},{"Patient":"Hi, I had a CTA because on the MRI , they thought there was something on my Pituitarry, The MRA showed something more suspecting of an aneurysm so they did a CTA. On the results they rulled out the aneurysm but said there vessels in the let P1 which were torturisity and most likely resembled the aneurysm. Can you explain the torturisity. I have heard this can cause stroke if not repaired.","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Tortuousity of the blood vessel refers to mild abnormal dilatation of the blood vessel, however, it is not similar to an aneurysm. An aneurysm is an abnormal out-pouching of the artery (a ballon like dilatation). An aneurysm has a higher risk of rupture and causing brain haemorrhage (bleeding in the brain). Tortuous vessel may predispose to a stroke, as blood flow may be sluggish through a tortuous vessel leading to thrombosis (clot formation). However, this risk is very small.

I returned to the surgeon, who treated the wound with silver nitrate and a scabbed shortly formed on the tissue. However the scab fell off 2 days ago, and the granulation tissue has not gone away (big bubble size of the tip of my fingertip) and seems to have gotten bigger. I have a followup appointment in 3 days. What other solutions are there to treat granulation tissue?","Doctor":"Hi! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. If the granulation tissue does not get healed, then there could be some pre disposing factor like an undesolved catgut in the suture line below the skin, which acted like a foreign body not allowing the wound to heal. This problem is not infrequently seen, and would resolve by itself once the catgut gets completely dissolved or gets extruded by the wound. So, there is nothing to be worried about. However, you have to get your son reviewed by your treating doctor inbetween to be sure to rule out any other complication or problem.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your son's problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery.

The reasons for vertigo are: 1. Vestibular system pathology (it is located in inner ear and maintains equilibrium, when affected it can cause vertigo) 2. Cerebro pontine angle tumors 3. Blood related problems- such as  recurrent hypoglycemia Normal MRI is helpful to rule out the presence of any Cerebro pontine angle pathology.

First of all, I would like to reassure you that your MRI brain does not show any serious abnormalities. The findings of subcortical white matter foci are most commonly seen in cases of migraine. As such, they are not of any significance, so, the radiologist also has reported them as nonspecific. Partial empty sella is also an incidental finding and can be seen normally.

Migraine and epilepsy (seizures) have common underlying mechanisms, and are probably two ends of the same spectrum. Also, it is not uncommon for migraine and epilepsy to co-exist in the same patient, when it is referred to as migralepsy.

I accept that pregnancy and child birth can put extra strain on the spine, especially lumbar spine (lower back). However, the chance of you getting a prolapse of discs leading to nerve compression is very low.

Dose prescribed is also sufficient dose that is 1000 mg per day.

Your MRI report of the lumbar spine (lower back) shows evidence of disc (soft tissue located between vertebral bones) bulges at two levels. This is causing compression of the nerves, that emerge at those levels. As a result, you may suffer from back pain, leg pain, tingling, numbness or weakness of legs.

But the drug comes with a lot of side effects as gum hypertrophy, blood cell count abnormalities, dizziness, hypotension, idiosyncratic reaction, ataxia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, increased hair growth etc. But the drug is widely available and is very cheap so it is very commonly prescribed. There are a lot of other drugs which can also be used in such situation but it depends upon doctors choice. Like Carbamazepine, Sodium valporate, Oxcarbamazepine. These drugs are comparatively better tolerated than eptoin. Other add on drugs as levatricetam can also be used with them. Supplementation of drugs with folic acid tablets is also very beneficial. And in last special precautions should be followed for such patients- never to skip any drug dose, if pt forgets to take tablet to a particular time it has to be taken when ever pt come to know about missed dose avoid bright lights, sound, loud music avoid heights take proper nutrition at proper time kindly consult your doctor before stopping any medicine thanks take care kindly rate"},{"Patient":"My step daughter (age 41) recently had a spinal cord bleed . At the rehabilitation center where she received therapy, one of the physicians told her that what she had was a stroke of the spine . After going on line to get information on these subjects, I do not see where the two are the same even though the results are the same. Is a spontaneous spinal cord bleed and a stroke of the spine the same thing?","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Bleed in the spinal cord is often due to bleeding diathesis, such as low platelet count, other disorders of blood, etc, or sometimes due to trauma. Spinal cord stroke is often due to lack of blood flow to spinal cord and the risk factors are diabetes, high BP or cholesterol, etc. I agree with you that both spinal cord bleed and stroke would have similar adverse impact on the patient. I hope it helps. Best wishes, Dr Sudhir Kumar MD DM (Neurology) Senior Consultant Neurologist"},{"Patient":"I'm having pain in my abdomen on the left side.

She is a senior in high school and is missing a lot of school because of these horrible symptoms. HELP!!!","Doctor":"Hello eugeniedoyle thanks for your question She developed tonsillitis and then subsequently underwent tonsillectomy. After tonsillectomy she developed seizure, brown urine, high heart rate, difficulty in breathing, pain in stomach and hips. I would like to tell you that seizures can develop in any child without any obvious past history, while tonsillectomy itself may lead to metabolic abnormalities. Uncontrolled bleeding is one of important complication of this surgery and it may lead to electrolyte abnormalities and consequent development of seizure. Due to significant blood loss she is having complaints of palpitation and difficulty in breathing. Due to seizure injury to muscles occurs and it lead to release of myoglobin (muslce pigment) from muscles to blood and which causes brown urine and severe muscle pains. At present she is on anti seizure medicine and continue giving the medicines, her other complaints will improve once her bloog Hemoglobin levels and electrolyte levels will come in normal range. Do proper care of her, give plenty of citrus fruits and juices. Reassure her and she will be all right in no time. Thanks All the Best KINDLY RATE"},{"Patient":"1.

I was diagnosed with diabetes in 11/2010, having been intermittently symptomatic for at least 3 years prior. Since DX, A1c levels have trended down from 7.0 to current level of 5.8, taking metformin and with dietary changes. Chronic depression/anxiety/stress of 20+ years is also adequately controlled with meds, but has been subject to ongoing unemployment woes since 11/2009 and consequential financial problems. Over the past 2 years I have noticed initially subtle, now gradually progressive mental status changes such as loss of focus and concentration, cognitive deficits affecting thinking, reasoning, decision-making and memory , plus mild expressive and receptive dysphasia signs. I asked my FP/PCP to order a brain scan w/wo contrast. The results I received last week are as follows: 1. Scattered nonspecific punctate bilateral frontal, bilateral parietal and left subinsular white matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensities may represent chronic microvascular ischemic changes, described in the impression as supratentorial and age-appropriate. 2. Bilateral old lentiform nuclei lacunar infarcts, the extent of which was not described. Having been a medical transcriptionist for 30+ years, I ve read a bit about both findings, and am vaguely familiar with the functions of these cerebral regions and the described processes, but I have two questions. I am assuming that either or both conditions are contributing to the mental status changes....particularly the bilateral lacunar infarcts. I originally thought these symptoms were attributable to chronic depression/anxiety/stress and the unemployment/financial problems. In your opinion, am I over-reacting to this news by making that assumption? Also, in view of these newly diagnosed deficits, would it be beneficial for me to consult with a neuropsychiatrist? I am asking because I am planning to seek counseling/ therapy for these problems since I need to re-enter the workforce. I am wondering if and how these conditions change the therapeutic approach. Specifically, I believe tests to evaluate the degree of cognitive deficits is in order, as it would stand to reason they would impact the modalities used in a therapeutic treatment plan. Any insight you can offer would be greatly appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello, I have noted all your complaints,  imaging data. The  imaging findings that you have can be  seen in patients with high blood pressure and diabetes. The infarcts that you have described   is also seen in patients with these problems. The most important thing to note is that whether you had any stroke in the past or not. People with high BP and diabetes  can have this MRI changes  without much problem also. So it is unwise to interpret this data without any clinical correlation. Regarding the cognitive problems as well as anxiety etc, this may represent a type of executive dysfunction which may/may not have relation with the current MRI findings. Interestingly some people can have both depression/anxiety as well as cognitive problem due to organic disease. Please undergo a joint evaluation by a  neuro-psychiatrist, clinical neurologist as well as by a psychiatrist. Their clinical evaluation will tell us if you have any organic cognitive problem or not so that we can plan our treatment accordingly.

The duration of 2 years of symptoms in reassuring in a way as longer the duration of headache less is the chance of having any structural aetiology.

Pituitary tumour is a benign tumour in most cases. Also, for small pituitary tumours, surgery is not required. Medications such as cabergoline or bromocriptine is used to treat this condition. Prolactin levels would drop and the tumour too would reduce in size. Regarding seizures, they are not connected to pituitary tumour. They are an unrelated problem. EEG may be normal in about 50% cases of epilepsy. So, your doctor may start anti epileptic medications to prevent any further seizures.

I was cleared by my doctor and I was able to resume sports and just played 5 soccer games as a goalkeeper the past two days. And I ve only been dizzy, but it went away with drinking water and eating, so I passed it off as dehydration .","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. If you have completely recovered from the symptoms of concussion, it is alright for you to go on a roller coaster ride, six weeks after concussion. However, if dizziness is persisting or coming intermittently, then it may get flared up after the ride. So, in case your symptoms are there, then, please do not go for the ride.

When I palpate it, he states that it s uncomfortable but that it does not hurt. He has no hx of back injury . What could this be? (I ve also noticed that his heart rate has been irregular lately. He skips beats and has short spurts of tachycardia . Could any of this be related?)","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for the  queryThe swelling close to the spine needs examination to exactly know it's nature. There could be a possible link between these lump and tachycardia., if the lump is infective one for example an abscess. How ever, if the swelling is something else like a lipoma, neurofibroma etc the link is unlikely and we may have to investigate him separately for  both these conditions. My advice will  be to get examined by a physician and get an ECG which will help us guide you better. Other causes of tachycardia/irregular  heart rate like thyroid dysfunction should be kept in mind.Best wishes"},{"Patient":"my tailbone had been hurting me for about a week until i later realized it was a risen coming on my tailbone and this is the third week i have been treating it with everything possible and still going to work in pain and my job is a job that requires a lot of heavy lifting. It is still under the skin and will not come to a head after three weeks. please help me","Doctor":"Hi, I believe your complaint deserves a more keener evaluation and specific diagnosis before any appropriate treatment could made. The causes could range from possibly infectious, inflammatory or traumatic causes. Knowing whether there is a recent history of trauma or not is important. Associated symptoms like fever, weight loss, associated joint pain, weight loss, fatigue could be important. Spinal TB is an option to be eliminated in this case. Any spinal or paraspinous abscess could present as such. Doing a spinal X ray (lumobospinal), a CT Scan scan and probably an MRI, depending on the case could be quite helpful. Complete blood count, markers of inflammation (ESR,CrP, RF, HLA27) could be of utmost importance, associated with a careful clinical evaluation in making a correct diagnosis. A visit to an Internist or surgeon could be of utmost importance in putting things together for a more comprehensive, specific and exact diagnostic and management plan. Thanks as I hope this helps, Best regards, Luchuo, MD."},{"Patient":"I had a seizure and was administered with Eptoin ( Phenytoin ) which caused Steven Johnson reaction.

My neuro had also started Levipil but that caused drowsiness and attention problems.","Doctor":"Hi Ravi, Thank you for posting your query. It is unfortunate that you developed severe allergic reactions to phenytoin. You should also avoid the following medications- carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbitone, as they can also cause allergic reactions.

The pinched nerve is not connected to the compression fractures of thoracic spine. On the other hand, you could be having another problem of disc prolapse in the neck or lower back region, resulting in pinched nerve and giving rise to pain in the neck, arm, lower back and legs. MRI spine focussed at cervical and lumbar region would help in the diagnosis.

The frequent seizures in your niece require evaluation by a neurologist. An MRI of brain-epilepsy protocol, would help in identifying any underlying reason in the brain, which is causing her seizures. Most cases would get controlled with medications. In some cases, surgery may be required. Please discuss this with her treating neurologist.

Your father needs evaluation by a neurologist and physician. Weight loss needs to be evaluated- whether it is due to poor intake of food, diabetes, thyoid problems, any infections or malignancy. Then, the underlying cause can be treated. Regarding cerebral atrophy, it can not be reversed. However, if your father has memory loss and dementia, he would benefit from medications such as donepezil, memantine, rivastigmine, etc. Best wishes, Dr Sudhir Kumar MD MD (Neurology) Senior Consultant Neurologist"},{"Patient":"Dear Dr. Keerthi, my neurologist has found only one lesion in my cerebellum , left side, 9.9 mm in size. He suggested it is possible that I have cysticercosis , but I wonder if these lesions can sometimes be confused with multiple sclerosis lesions. I have not traveled, nor have I eaten any undercooked pork. I am just confused and have so many neurological symptoms.","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. One thing we can be sure of is that you do not have multiple sclerosis (MS). In MS, as per the definition, one should have multiple lesions in various locations. Also, there are certain very specific areas affected in MS such as corpus callousum, peri ventricular areas, etc. Regarding neurocysticercosis (NCC), it is possible with a lesion in cerebellum. I presume contrast MRI study was also done. If a scolex is seen, then the diagnosis is certain, otherwise a presumptive diagnosis of NCC can be made. It is not necessary to eat pork or non veg food to get NCC. If the vegetarian food is contaminated with tapeworm eggs, then one can still get NCC.

It is not clear what the actual diagnosis is based on the description provided. But it seems to be a problem of the spinal cord with compression. This can result from trauma (fracture of vertebra), infections such as TB of spine and also tumors. Surgery is definitely helpful, but it should be done early. If there is a delay, then, an irreversible damage of spinal cord can take place and the patient would not improve even after surgery. There are many good neurologists and neurosurgeons in Patna, but AIIMS New Delhi is definitely a better option for surgery.

Encorate chrono is a safe and effective medication for treating fits. The dose depends on the body weight- 15 to 60 mg per kg body weight. So, the dose of 200 mg twice daily (total dose per day of 400 mg) is quite low. If you still feel that the drowsiness is because of the overdosage of encorate (sodium valproate), we can do a blood test to look for its level- serum valproate level. If found high, the dose may be reduced or stopped altogether and replaced with another medicine such as phenytoin.

First of all, you should undergo an evaluation by a neurologist to ascertain whether you have memory loss and also to assess the degree or severity of memory loss. Secondly, we need to find out the underlying reasons for memory loss. It could range from simple stress & lack of concentration to vitamin B 12 deficiency, blood clots or infection of the brain. Your neurologist would be able to establish the cause of memory loss. Lastly, medications would be required depending on the cause of your symptoms.

Sometimes, it is not possible to distinguish between tuberculoma (TB infection) and neurocysticercosis (tapeworm infection) on MRI brain. There are certain features such as size more than 2 cm, too much edema (swelling in brain), focal neurological deficits (such a weakness of arms or legs, etc), which may favour a diagnosis of tuberculoma. However, in many cases, we are forced to start treatment for either TB or tapeworm infection on empirical basis. Repeat scan after three months help us. If the size of lesion decreases, then good. If the size increases, then a biopsy (a small surgical procedure) of the brain lesion is done. TB medications are safe. However, liver function test and eye check up may be required to look for side effects.

Burning pain (paresthesia) from left temple into upto upper body, is related to involvement of brain on the right side.

Typical Parkinson's disease- this type generally responds to medicine. However, as the disease advances, the response to medicine may come down and patients may develop side effects related to medicines. I am sorry that i don’t know the exact medicine your father is taking as of now. The best medicine will be Levodopa carbidopa combination, in a reasonably good dose depending upon his response and tolerance. There are other options in this parkinson's diases apart from medicine that is known as deep brain stimulation. He has to have regular exercises, physiotherapy etc. 2. Atypical parkinson’s disease: Here the patients symptomatology will be more than the typical one. They may have memory problem, behavioral problem, and frank hallucination to start with. This can be recognized by a neurologist. Generally speaking these subgroups don’t benefit much with treatment. There are so many types of these sub-types. Treatment depends upon the exact sub-type.

The leg is usually numb so its hard to know if its paining...please help.","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Your symptoms are new onset and hence require evaluation. It is possible that some new nerves or a part of spinal cord has got compressed, resulting in leg weakness. You should consult a neuro specialist and get an MRI of spine done for appropriate diagnosis. You would recover with early treatment and physiotherapy.

Due to a recent diagnosis of Orthostatic Hypotension , syncope and my complaints of memory loss and cognitive function, I had an MRI brain scan recently with the following findings: There is mild diffuse cerebral volume loss. There are a few scattered nonspecific FLAIR hyperintensities in the periventricular and subcortical white matter. In addition, there is a somewhat linear hyperintensity noted in the pons that demonstrates high signal on T2 and low on T1 signal intensity. Further evaluation is recommended with MRI of the neck with and without contrast. What does this mean in layman s terms? Thank You.","Doctor":"Dear patient To answer your query the MRI findings are suggestive of small vessel disease. To simplify further it means that the smaller vessels of deep brain matter have decrease in lumen size which results in hampered blood supply resulting in the changes described. It is most commonly seen in patients with long standing hypertension and as in your case due to vasculitis. I can definitely say these are not responsible for your ortho static hypotension which can most likely to be due to autonomic neuropathy which is seen in Sjögren's syndrome."},{"Patient":"I had an MRI a few months ago.

Memory 2. Language 3. Personality 4. Visuospatial 5. Execution and planing 6.

It is unfortunate that your father suffered spinal cord injury, resulting into paraplegia (paralysis of both legs). This happened because of bone fracture of spine due to the fall. In your father's case, possibly, there was delay between the fall and surgery. If surgery is done early, we can expect some recovery of functions.

Thanks","Doctor":"Hello, Neurocystcervosis, the infection caused by the larval form of the tapeworm Taenia solium, is the most common parasitic disease of the central nervous system and the most common cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. Management includes symptomatic treatment as well as treatment directed against the parasite. If the parasite is dead, the treatment is directed primarily against the symptoms (eg, anticonvulsants for management of seizures). If the parasite is viable or active,a course of steroids or immunosuppressants is recommended before the use of anticysticercal drugs. Both the drugs prescribed to your wife are anti convulsants and are good. It becomes the discretion of the doctor about which one to use.

Your symptoms even though can be due to other diseases conditions such as peripheral neuropathy are more towards MS. MS is usually occurs between the ages of 20-40 years. If taking steroid (hydrocodone), antibiotics (amoxicillin), antacis (prilosec) and antidepressant and still no improvement then it still supports the fact that you might be having MS. Other possible causes of your symptoms can be  Encephalomyelitis, CNS Vasculitis, Lyme Disease. Lupus Erythematosus, Spastic Paraparesis, Behçet Syndrome, Sarcoidosis.

I need help???","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to HCM, Diabetes Type 1 patients need to be under constant supervision of Doctors. You as a care taker for him, you should also be  aware and educated about his health issues. The most common cause for twitching and convulsions in Diabetic patients is Hypoglycemia. There are more chances of Hypoglycemia during midnight, and early hours. Hypoglycemia is more dangerous then hyperglycemia. I would say you immediately take him to Diabetes Specialist / Diabetes Nurse/ Physician or family Physician. If in case you do not have immediate access to the doctor, you do following 1. Monitor regularly his blood glucose level, six times an a day-before each meal ( breakfast, Lunch and Dinner) and two hour after meals. keep a recording. 2. Doses and type of Insulin Injection has to be determined according to the levels of Glucose. You may write us the dose, timings site and type of Injection Insulin he is taking, so we can advise you accordingly. 3. Best thing is that we should avoid hypoglycemia, but if it happens you should immediately give him Some biscuits, Lump of sugar, Juice Etc. followed by some food with low Glycaemic index. There may be some other reasons for Convulsions, which we have to look for, if the problem persist even after tight control of blood sugar.

Now my main question is why do patients have seizures during these types of comas and how does affect the brain? Is it normal for the siezures to occur? What are the chances of her having brain damage and what kind of brain function is expected to have during this kind of coma? Thank you, Ana","Doctor":"Hi, Based on your query, I want to say that generally, coma is not induced for heart attacks. Whether your friend had a cardiac arrest (where the heart beats stop for some time) and was revived. I think this must be the case. Here, the chances of brain recovery depends on the duration for which heart was not beating, until it was revived with resuscitation. Anything more than five minutes results in significant brain damage. The exact damage can be assessed with tests such as EEG and evoked potential studies. Clinical examination by a neurologist can also help in that. Seizures are common in this condition.

It was a severe head injury and more than four months have passed since. At this stage, the most important aspect of her care is physiotherapy along with good nursing care.

I occasionaly get a throbbing pain just under the left rib cage in an area about the size of my hand? Could this be shingles related or something else/","Doctor":"Hi,This typically is described as postherpetic pain which is a self remitting condition. If the severity is to much then a medication called gabapentene will help immensely.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am Seema, aged 36 yrs. For the last 10 days, I am suffering numbness in my left hand and arm alongwith numbness in my left ear and continuous flow of water from my left eye. I went to consult a physician who got my ECG and cervical X-ray done, which were alright. I was asked to get cholestril and TSH done. TSH level was 10.15, as against the highest acceptable level of 5.5. Cholestrol was ok. I was prescribed Maxgalin M 75 and Storvas 10 with Eltroxin 50 mg (I was taking 25 mg for last one yr). When things didnt improve, I went to see a neurologist who got NCV done. He told that I ma suffering with some Canal Syndrome, wherein the main nerve supplying blood to the hand is getting pressed. I need to take same medicines for 6 mnths, else surgery is suggested. Pls suggest as I am feeling a lot drowsy and inactive the whole day and not able to go to office as I am experiencing a lot of weakness. Are the medicines alright ?","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Most likely, you are suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). In this condition, the medical nerve is compressed at the level of wrist. Blood flow is normal in this condition. Thyroid disease is a risk factor for CTS. Maxgalin (pregabalin) is a medicine to relieve nerve pain. As per your description, you do not have pain, you only have numbness. So, maxgalin may not be required. Drowsiness and dizziness are common side effects of maxgalin. Storvas (atorvastatin) is a medicine to lower the cholesterol. As your cholesterol is normal, then why are you prescribed this drug? Please discuss these issues with your neurologist. Best wishes, Dr Sudhir Kumar MD DM (Neurology) Senior Consultant Neurologist"},{"Patient":"Hi. My mother is suffering from sever neck pain for a long time. As prescribed by doctor she has undergone an MRI cervical spine where the findings are as under: Mild posterior protrusion of C4-C5, C5-C6, & C6-C7 discs causing mild thecal cmpression but no remarkable spinal or neural foraminal stenosis As prescribed by docttor she is undergoing traction for the last week but still the pain does not seem to reduce.. She gets relief when she is sleeping or applyting hot pad . Request you to please suggest","Doctor":"Hi Amita, Thanks for writing your query. After reading your post, I would suggest that you should continue physiotherapy and traction as adviced by your doctor. You can take pain killer like Ibuprofen twice a day after meals along with muscle relaxant chloraxazone along with an antacid. Doing hot fomentation and application of pain relieving gel on the neck will give some relief to the symptoms. Also donot use a very thick pillow. I hope this is helpful to you.

My PCP is sending me to a Neuro surgeon, but I m not sure when I will be able to get in there and I have some questions... Based on the info you have is spinal fusion an option? If it is would I lose much of my range of motion? What other alternatives are there that I might be a good candidate for?","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for posting this query in HCMI have noted your complaintsPlease note that, if the bove described data are MRI findings you donot have to worry.Based upon this findings it is difficult  to tell you that you need spinal fusion or notThe most important thing is  to note the clinical symptoms and then  the clinical/neurological examination findings. I am very sorry but you have not provided us the exact clinical symptoms. If you have pain and symptoms are suggestive of nerve root compression which has not improved with conservative treatment, then only you should go for operative procedures . This may/may not involve spinal fusion. So you shoud not worry at all.Please get evaluated  initially by a neurophysician who will assess you and will let you know if surgery is mandatory in your case. If surgery is required you may proceed to see a neurosurgeon.Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"My father was admitted to the hosptial yesterday via EMS. he was discovered by a trooper after he pulled off the road in what EMS describe as a seizure. He is 73, no prior seizure disorders no diabetes no HBP. He had a debilitating injury in his 30s to his spine and he has been on large doses of oral pain meds since then. he was taken into the hospital and they intubated him. He was awake yesterday afternoon,speaking fine and remembers everyone but then had alternating sessions of confusion where he didn t know why he was in the hospital. he has no limb numbness, no facial drooping. They took him in for an MRI late last night. I dont know the results yet. My question is, does this sound like a possible TIA? Could his alerted states be caused by IV pain meds they are giving him for his spine?","Doctor":"Hello, TIA generally presents with  transient symptoms  characterized by weakness of  one of the hands, legs, numb ness of  one side, diffiluty in speaking, imbalce while walking, numbness in face and so on. The symtoms that your father had is not suggestive of TIA. The possibilities could be a seizure with postictal state, low/high sodium/glucose  level, low/high calcium  or other electrolyte imbalance or even brain infection. Some of the medicines  can  cause similar co0mplinats too. Once must review his medications. MRI may give a better picture. Elcetrencephalography may help classify the seizure, if any. Get in touch with a neurologist there who will guide you that way i have discussed Good Health"},{"Patient":"My husband began having a fast developing dementia in October, and it has gotten very bad. I would characterize his symptoms as later stage of Alzheimer s Disease. He is nearly always incohert, his cognitive abilities are practically gone, and he thinks he isn t in his own home. He knows everyone--friends and family. He has no pain, no seizures. His takes very small steps, like an old man. He s had CT scans, MRI, 2 spinal taps, Pet scan , EEG . His neurologist has rule out Alzheimer s. The MRI had a lighted area in his brain, but no cancers cells in LP. EEG showed slow brain waves, but nothing definitive. PET scan did not suggest Alzheimer s. Last spinal tap showed a high level of GAD65 antibodies (.2 titer). Five years ago, he was diagnosed with Stage IV NSCLC . He s had chemo, the last type being Tarceva, which he no longer takes. His diagnosis presently is dementia. What are the doctors missing, if anything?","Doctor":"Thanks for  posting this question in HCM Let me tell you that demetia has  so many causes. If  the symtoms have been noticed for the last few months only and he is rapidly progressing, a pssibility of rapidly progessing dementia  will be likely. Other conditions that can behave in this way are autoimmune encephalitis (more so when the GAD 65 IS ELEVATED), vitamin B12 deficinecy, thyroid problem, Hashimotos' encephalopathy. In the background hisotory of cancer, i will advise you to discuss the MRI and all the scans with a neuroradiologist. Please note that another rare cause  of this type of illness is cruzfeldt jacob's disease He needs to br re-evaluated by a neurologist or cognitive expert who will synthesize all the reports and guide you. If found to have auto-immune encephalitis, he may recover with immunomodulator.

However, if a person has leg pain, or pain radiating from low back to legs, or if the leg pain increases on walking (claudication pain); then, surgery may be required. These are also the indications for doing MRI of lumbar spine in your case. As of now, the treatment would be with medications and physiotherapy. Please discuss these with your doctor.

I wasn t trashed but definatly feeling the alcohol. I ate dinner and had to go to the bathroom I went to look in the mirror and got this crazy dizzy spell my head was spinning I tried calling for help but it took everything in me to shout for a friend. By the time my friends heard me I fainted and was laying on the floor and convulsing and vomiting . I remember being down but it felt like a dream until I was done throwing up. I drank lots of water and it never happened again but what was that? Was I dehydrated? Did I have a seizure? I don t understand. Please help!","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. There are two possibilities in your case: 1. Syncope- in this condition, a person faints for a short while, and recovers completely on its own. It may occur after exhaustion, fatigue, fear, etc, due to transient lack of blood flow to the brain. 2. Seizures- in this condition, a person may faint without any provocation. After regaining consciousness, the person has confusion for some time. I feel most likely you had a syncope, given the circumstances in which you had it. Please consult a neurologist for detailed evaluation.

At present he is in the hospital under oxygen because he suffered a seizure and is alos heamorraging in the head and brain.","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Enlarged heart is often a sign of heart failure. Heart failure is more common in people with diabetes and high BP, especially if they are not well controlled. Another cause can be hypertrophy (thickening of heart muscle wall) due to high BP. An evaluation by a cardiologist along with echocardiogram would be able to sort out this problem and establish the correct cardiac cause.

Your Doctor  wants to rule out any ovarian , tubal  or peritoneal pathology. These pathology could be due to chronic Pelvic inflammatory disease, or due to scar formation after rupture of any endometriotic cysts, or as a long term complication of hysterectomy itself. After removal of uterus, ovaries stops functioning gradually. Your cyclic pains and mood swings could be due to changes in hormonal level.IBS is a diagnosis of excusion. Intestinal symptoms can happen due to scar adhesions on intestine or over omentum.There can be thousands of problem, and it is highly possible that your doctor do not find anything wrong. So i would advise you to not worry too much. once you know your specific diagnosis then you can explore it in depth.Best WishesDr H Hamdani"},{"Patient":"I am a 48 y/o w/f who for years has had HA, that increasingly got worse.

It takes about 6 to 12 months for recovery. Since the usage of that limb is not as much as the other limb, the growth will be affected- so the length and girth might be small. Please have regular follow up with your doctor. Good to know that he does some action with that limb. Massage and exercise should be continued. Your doctor will examine your kid- look for improvement- if improvement is not adequate he will recommend some minor surgeries. Some kids have a full recovery and some are left with permanent issues- it depends on the severity of nerve damage. Please have a regular follow up with your doctor. Hope my answer helps you.

I can understand your discomfort on account of pain and multiple surgeries. In your case, following can be helpful in improving your quality of life: 1. Medications for pain relief such as pregabalin, gabapentin or duloxetine. 2. Physiotherapy- such as IFT, ultrasound, heat application, etc 3. Passive and active exercises for the back, 4. Epidural injections 5. Surgery should be the last option, as you have already undergone seven surgeries! 6. Avoid lifting heavy weights and forward bending.

EEG reports - myoclonic Epilepsy taken a three weeks back. We did MRI for him today & the report is : Mild Defuse Cerebral Atrophy dispropotionate of corresponding age . For fits--- He is on 5 ml debriton (from 1st month of birth) & 3 drops Revatril (3 drops mor/3 drops Eve). The revatril was just added three weeks back. Since then he is all the time sleepy, almost motionless, expressionless and responsless. I don t know what happend to him. He was very very active from birth till 6th month (Depriton: 2ml only) but from the last two months there is no head control. He has delayed milestones. Is the brain demage a permanent one? Is there any way to recover the brain defect? Should we continue with the debriton & revatril? Any specific ketogenic diet or any other usefull information????? Thanks","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Sleepiness is because of rivotril (clonazepam). So, the dose should be reduced in consultation with his doctor. We expect some degree of developmental delay in your child, in view of hypoglycaemia in neonatal period and fits since early days of life. However, with increasing age, he would acquire all the milestones, though he may be behind other children of his age. At this point, control of fits is the most important, as recurrence of fits may further retard his brain development. Regular physiotherapy and exercises would also be very useful.

I started to get really dizzy so as a normal reaction I lay on my back and placed my hands on my head for it to stop shaking. It stopped, but my eyes started nodding , I guess you can say, and the dizziness was getting worse. I shut my eyes for a couple of seconds and then it went away. I fully aware of what was going on the whole time, nothing like this has ever happened to me before.","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Uncontrollable (or involuntary) head nodding could be due to partial (or focal fits). It is not a generalised fit, as you would have lost consciousness if it was a generalised one. Short duration of symptoms also favour the same. For further evaluation, you should consult a neurologist. You may require MRI brain and EEG for confirmation of diagnosis.

Vaso vagal syncope is a common illness. Cardiac arrhythmia can be responsible for this. I noted that you had a pacemaker implanted for a possible bradycardia. This makes you quite safe and you should be able to resume all normal activities. Regarding memory impairment, please get a check up done. It could be related to anxiety, vitamin B 12 deficiency, etc. A brain scan would also help in diagnosing any underlying brain disease such as ischemia (less blood flow).

First of all, I would like to reassure you that the MRI abnormalities in your mom's case are minor, and there is no need to worry. Keppra (levetiracetam) may cause confusion, and so, if possible it should be stopped and replaced with another anti seizure drug such as sodium valproate. For mini strokes (small vessel ischemic changes), a blood thinner such as aspirin, should be started. For diffuse volume loss, no specific treatment is available.

They have become worse and she has also stumbled on several occasions. She has been taking thyroxine for years to treat hypothyroidism and went for tests yesterday for Parkinson s disease. She was told that they didn t think she had Parkinson s, could it be her thyroxin medication causing the tremors?","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Thyroxine overdosage may lead to tremors. It can be confirmed by blood tests- thyroid profile, where T4 level will be high and TSH would be low.

Headache can be due to migraine, cluster headache, brain tumor, infection, vascular malformations and so on. I have noted all your problems You need to be re-evaluated in a hospital/teaching medical university with Multidisciplinary facility where neurologist/headache specialist / dentist/ interventional radiologist will jointly evaluate you. Their clinical evaluation will determine if you need a brain MRI scan (I am not sure if you have done to rule out any vascular malformation in the brain too). Some people may harbor vascular malformations in multiple sites of the brain. If it turns out to be migraine (which is a diagnosis of exclusion), you will benefit with  the following approach 1. Acute attack: simple analgesics. Sumatriptan nasal spray. Avoid the precipitating factor. Avoid stress, coffee and lack of sleep. Do regular exercises and good sleep hygiene 2. During the chronic phase: You may take one of these medicines: Amitriptiline, propranolol, topiramate, valproate etc. The changes which are seen in the skull and spike are due to the presence of long standaing vascular malformaion.

This increases their risk for developing long-term health complications from spinal fracture, such as spine deformity. Minimally Invasive Procedures for Treating Spinal Fracture . other non surgical modality, Vertebroplasty is a pain treatment for vertebral compression fractures that fail to respond to conventional medical therapy, such as minimal or no pain relief with analgesics or narcotic doses that are intolerable. Vertebroplasty, a nonsurgical treatment performed by interventional radiologists using imaging guidance, stabilizes the collapsed vertebra with the injection of medical-grade bone cement into the spine.

So, I agree with your concern that you could have seizures after stopping the anti epileptic drugs. One method to find out whether you could have seizures in future is to do an MRI brain (Magnetisation transfer sequence) to look for perilesional gliosis (scar the site of infection).

Isolated numbness of the hand fingers may be due to a peripheral nerve problem of the hand, usually caused by the mechanical compression of the hand nerve, such as while sleeping. As of now, it does not look like stroke. However, if the numbness spreads to involve forearm, arm and face, it could suggest a new stroke.

I can understand the discomfort you are facing on account of pain due to herniated discs. Surgery is definitely an option for treatment, but it is often not the first choice due to various reasons such as cost, high morbidity, risk of surgery or anaesthesia and patients' dislike for it. In your case, you can start medications such as pregabalin or gabapentin capsules, which are very helpful. In addition, physiotherapy methods such as ultrasound and IFT would also be useful. You should take adequate rest, avoid forward bending and lifting heavy weights.

The disc herniation is only slight so it is not an urgent indication for surgery. You may first take epidural injection and see the response. It will relieve your pain and if during that time the disc heals you may not need any more interventions.

A search has to be made for any small discharging spot (called sinus in medical terminology). If discharge is not from a spot and it is from a diffuse area then it is likely to be sweat as you are suspecting.

The most promising treatment is deep brain stimulation which is an operation in which an electrode is inserted into the brain and connected to a pacemaker. This can potentially cure the patient. Therefore it would be useful to consult with a Functional neurosurgeon who is trained in deep brain stimulation. The alternative method of surgery is called Thalamotomy in which a small area inside the thalamus is burned to produce the same clinical response. However, the tremors can return after some time. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Is Eptoin safe to take even if u hav no history of epilepsy , as my husband had a seizure due to high viral fever, after wards all tests r ok i.e EEG , CT scan , he is normal back to work ,driving to office . But still prescribed Eptoin 100 mg - 2 tab in night/ 2 months as precautionary measure my question is is it safe to take it or will it make him dependant on these types of medications.","Doctor":"Hi, The medicine has been prescribed in order to prevent him from having another seizure. It would be best if the withdrawal of the medicines at an appropriate time is done with your doctor's advice. Though Eptoin can cause side effects and problems, if he has tolerated it well for so long, the remaining course would hopefully be uneventful., There is no risk of dependance to Eptoin.

I was started on cymbalta in october at 30mg for anxiety and depression and now I have just recently started vyvanse at 20mg. do you know why I feel fuzzy or tingly in my brain? it kinda feels like a seizure is about to happen but is stopped by the medication","Doctor":"Hi there ~ You have three separate issues.  You have been seizure free for 5 years and hence you may be tried to be tapered off of depakote to see if it helps with your symptoms.  However, depakote is also a mood stabilizer and may be helping with the depression. Cymbalta at 30 mg is a low dose and may not be contributing to your symptoms, however you are on a very low dose of the medication and it should actually help in any parasthesias that you may be having due to neuropathic reasons.  However, I would suggest that you see a doctor to have your medication reviewed. You do not mention why you were started on vyvanse and why it was started at 20 mg daily.  Your side effects seem to most likely be linked to this new medication.  Please reconsult your doctor. I hope this helped.

I have been tested for HIV/AIDS, STD’S and everything else so to say and the blood results are all normal. I have not had intercourse for almost a year. This is my story. Please help me! On the 29th of August 2011, I experienced extreme abdominal pain, which prevented me from standing up and walking. I immediately went to my local doctor, who referred me to the ER department, thinking it may be appendicitis. At the ER blood and urine tests were taken and the doctors found that there was nothing wrong. They suspected to see a tubular structure which according could be the appendix but insisted that it was not and thus decided to refer me to the Spectrum to do a few scans of my abdomen etc. The scans turned out normal, where only small cyst of normal size was found on or near my right ovary and a little bit of free fluid. These scans apparently were NORMAL. The doctors said that there s nothing to be concerned about and that this pain should go away soon. I was put on antibiotics in case of having caught a virus or some internal preventable infection and after almost a week of taking them, the pain became a little less, although it did not go away completely. I had to stop taking the antibiotics a little while after, as I started to experience some of the side effects such as nausea etc. At this point, seeing as my doctors believed that it may only be ovulation pain (mittelschmerz) I was relieved when I got my periods on the 13th September 2011, thinking that the pain soon after will go away. I was wrong. After my periods, on the seventh day, I had a normal shower and had some dead blood after it, which lasted for two days. I believed that this was normal seeing as how it sometimes happens after my periods. However, whilst this was the case and whilst I am still convinced that the brown spotting was normal because it sometimes happens before and after my periods, the pain continues to stay and has recently moved to the right side of my abdomen. Today, 23rd September 2011, 10 days after my last period and almost a month of this pain starting, I still have the pain like I have had since about a month ago. However, now it is solely on the right side, which I believe is exactly on the right ovary, where the normal sized cyst was found. The pain is not extreme, where I cannot move at all BUT it is quite uncomfortable, dull and to an extent quite hurtful if I could say. It is constantly there and even though it goes away for a couple of hours every now and then, when it comes back I can feel it on the right, somewhere either near or on my ovary, which then moves towards the inner side of the beginning of my outer vagina lips are. Two days ago, when the pain was there again, it even numbed my thighs and half of my right leg. I went to see the doctor immediately after this the next morning and she had told me that it is nothing. I asked her if it could possibly be endometriosis and she said ‘no’ and that I have nothing to worry about. But, how can I not worry when this pain has been constant for almost a month? I do not exercise, lay mostly in my bed to relax and it’s still there. I cannot move around too much because it keeps coming back after I move and doctors aren’t doing anything to find out what it could really be. They just keep telling me that it could be ovulation pain or something else that I should not be concerned about. However, even though this could be the case, I don’t think that ovulation pain could last every day for a whole month. Nevertheless, blood tests, urine tests and even scans have not shown anything wrong with me and even an internal scan of my pelvic, abdomen and vagina turned out to be fine except for that small normal size cyst and the free fluid, which they said is also normal. What could this be? I am planning to go and get a few more tests but don’t know what I should be testing for. PLEAS HELP!","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for your question. Read and understood your history, reports and query. None of the medicines or lab reports are responsible for your pain in abdomen.

I understand that you had back surgery and later infection (note the exact infection in you is not clear to me whether it was tuberculosis or bone infection osteomyelitis etc). What i feel that the presence of the two symptoms that you have listed need urgent neurological evaluation. I strongly advise you to undergo a detailed neurological evaluation by a neurologist and that will tell us whether you a MRI scan of the spine or not.

About 12 years ago I had a neck fusion C-6 and C-7. What s going on? I am 60, work with special needs kids and stay active. Could it be that our freezing cold temps, for about a month, have something to do with this? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello, First of all let me explain you that a given medical symptom like yours could be due to various causes. Back pain and current like sensation could be due to spondylosis in the cervical spinal cord, or other causes (any tumor, demyelination, spinal cord problem) can cause similar symptoms. In old age this could be due to spondylosis.  You need a detailed neurological examination in order to determine the exact neurological problem. The presence of current like sensation is a point of concern as it suggests that one structure in the spinal cord is being compressed. Hence an urgent neurological evaluation will be required followed later by a repeat imaging and nerve conduction study (may be optional depending upon the early evaluation). Your treatment will largely depend upon the cause. Hope this explanation will help you.

Thanks. email address M","Doctor":"Hello, First of let me explain you that a given medical problem can be due to various causes and the main objective of the treating doctor is to identify the exact cause/causes and deal accordingly. For example, fever can be due to viral fever, malaria, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, cancer and even AIDS can cause fever. Cognitive decline can be due to various causes too. It can be due to old head injury, brain infection etc. There are other causes of cognitive decline too which generally occur in old age, but can occur in young age also. These are Alzheimer’s disease, Fronto-temporal dementia etc. Let us see your problem. You have cognitive decline and you had history of head injury. Note that head injury can result in cognitive decline and it depends upon the severity of injury and the area of brain damaged like regional vs diffuse injury. That means the outcome of cognitive decline after head injury depends upon the severity of brain damage. Another important point which you need to note that your cognitive decline may not have any association with head injury. I understand the neuropsychological test that you have undergone. Note that these tests will tell us the area of brain damage and it will not reflect the cause. I strongly advise you to meet a local neurologist or cognitive expert who will assess you and will correlate your head injury with the current functional status. Further he will tell you if you have other problem which can account for the cognitive decline. The medicines which are taking may not help much if the problem is related to head injury. Hence you need neurological evaluation at the earliest Hope this clarifies"},{"Patient":"Hi I have this feeling/ sensation/ pressure in the middle of my back on my spine like someone is pressing a marble into one spot (for almost 6 months).

Now I am facing one heavy seizure each month. Please suggest the best remedy.","Doctor":"Thanks for posting this question in HCM I am a neurologist and epilepsy specialist responding to you First of all let me tell you that treatment of epilepsy largely depends upon the exact type of epilepsy (it may be a focal epilepsy due to brain tumor, scar related to head injury or other cause or it can be genetically mediated generalized epilepsy). For a proper diagnosis of epilepsy, a neurologist will need EEG test and MRI scan of brain; both of these data are not available to me in your case. Let us see your case. I understand that you had a head injury. This might have resulted in a focal scar in the brain which can cause epilepsy. I am not sure the exact severity of head injury and if there is a scar or not. One interesting thing which you have to note that some types of epilepsy namely primary generalized epilepsy can become worse after treatment with Oxcarbazepine. However this possibility is low in your case but cannot be excluded without a long term EEG and MRI scan of brain. Once, a long term EEG and MRI can identify he exact type of epilepsy. We will have the following options 1. If focal: Encorate chrono will not be a good option. You can continue higher doses of Oxcarbazepine upto 30mg/kg (i donot know your body weight). If this fails, you may try adding Clobazam. If MRI shows scar the other options (if these medicines fail) you have to undergo a detailed presurgical evaluation in an epilepsy centre. 2. If your diagnosis turns out to be primary generalized epilepsy, you have to withdraw oxcarbazepine. You will only benefit with Encorate chrono I advise you to meet one epilepsy expert in your place who will deal the way i have described Hope this will help you"},{"Patient":"hi my grandmother has been prescribed flucoxacillin to treat cellulitis in her legshowever it is not possible to monitor her all the time as to when she has eaten especially as she has alzheimers.

I felt the same way about 6 months ago, but I also thought about suicide , I went to the hospital and they determined that I don t have depression and that this was just a side effect to being upset at the time. I don t smoke , I don t do drugs, so, its not withdrawals from any physical substance, maybe a person i miss. but other than that, should I worry at all? have you ever seen breaking bad? well, there are parts when walter throws burning matches into the pool. right now that sounds like a good idea. I ve tried drinking fluids, fresh air, but It s been about 30minutes. it s not that bad I m just wondering if it might be anxiety or something.","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. The commonest cause of involuntary shaking is anxiety. So, this could be the case in you too. Other common cause is essential tremors, where there generally is a family history. A deficiency of vitamin B12 and excess of thyroid hormone could be other causes. These can be tested in blood test.

During the procedure the doc. hit my spinal cord nerve with the needle causing a burning and electrical like feeling down my left leg sending it straight up.

Also I get tingling up my spine and sometimes sending it into head aches and bad neck pain? What is going on?","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. At L5-S1, the chance of hitting the spinal cord is nil, as the spinal cord ends at the lower border of L1. So, the doctor most likely hit one of the nerves that originate from the lower spinal cord. All the symptoms can be explained on that basis. For relief, you could take medications such as gabapentin or pregabalin.

Could u pls tell me the fastest way to get him recover","Doctor":"Hello, I am a neurologist, thank you for posting this question in HCM Let me tell you that any given medical problem in medicine can be due to various reason and the long-term outcome depends the cause. Further in neurology, the outcome also largely depends upon the degree of initial damage to the brain. Brain stroke are mainly of two types, one in which there is bleeding and the second where there is less blood supply to brain in a particular area and that area gets damaged due to poor blood supply. The outcome of stroke depends upon which area of the brain is damaged, whether he had complete or partial paralysis and whether he had multiple areas of the brain involved. Again the outcome depends if you have gone to the hospital for treatment within 3 hrs or not, as there is a treatment available which can be given only within 3 hours. By this time i hope some of your doubts are clarified. Now you must understand that you have not posted so many things in order to clarify your doubts. However, i agree with your physician and what you have to do is to continue the medicines what your doctor has given and you have to go for aggressive neurorehabilitation which will help him a lot.

All these things will hep to get  the correct diagnosis. Back to your question, you have listed some symptoms, based upon these i think that you need an urgent neurological examination to see if you have neurological deficits.

There are no significant interactions between the drugs you are taking- Keppra (levetiracetam), Xanax (alprazolam) and accutane (isotretinoin). So, you can safely continue to take them.

Again i want to stress that a single individual can have multiple medical problems which can cause the same symptoms Let us go back to your problem. The neck pain, back pain which comes down would suggest a possibility of nerve compression in your spine, called as radiculopathy. The management of these patients largely depends upon the neurological deficits they have. If there is no no neurological deficit after detailed neurological assessment, then the patient can be management  conservatively with medicines and exercises. On the other hand if the pain is severe and the patient has neurological deficit surgical disc removal is an options.

Therefore, my advice will be to get the guidance of a physician who is well versed with seizure medications and taper the medications as per his advice. The other thing to keep in mind is that if he does have a single fit when the drugs are being tapered, that will impact his driving licence as well when he is in the US. The pertinent advice regarding the local regulations for driving etc will be given by the physician there. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"hi.

First of all, I would like to reassure you that the MRI findings of your lumbar spine are not serious and there is no need to worry. MRI shows a mild disc prolapse and most likely, no surgery would be required. Treatment would consist of physical therapy and neuropathic pain medications such as pregabalin and gabapentin. It is good to note that you are already getting better.

I understand that more, less invasive surgery, could eliminate the problem by peeling the scab off the injured area. I also understand that this surgery is being performed at Montreal Neurological Centre and Toronto s Western hospital. How correct is my understanding? YYYY@YYYY Thanks Peter","Doctor":"Hi Peter, Your understanding is correct. The scar from the previous operation could be the irritative focus that produces the epilepsy. To try and establish this hypothesis, you would undergo various tests that would include MRI scan and other scans, neuropsychological testing, scalp EEG's including possibly telemetry which includes a period of stay in the hospital where you will be hooked up with wires recording the EEG continuously and a camera recording you as well. After all this, the doctors would sit together and decide if you will need a period of intracranial monitoring where the EEG electrodes are placed after opening your skull over the area of scar. With this further testing to check the function of the surrounding areas of the brain will be done. Following this, the surgery to remove the scarred tissue will be performed. Yes, MNI is one of the worl's most experienced centres doing this type of work. But there are other centres across Canada and the US which do the same type of operation as well."},{"Patient":"I have complex partial epilepsy and night before last I woke up completely out of breath. I got to the hallway and called out for my husband because the feeling I was having was exactly like prior to a seizure. For the first time ever I was able to get my breath back and calm down and did not go into seizure. I think I am holding my breath while sleeping.","Doctor":"Hello, This episode could have been an aborted seizure. Sometimes a seizure starts and doesn't go on to the full typical attack and stops early and that is called an aborted attack. It means that the medications you are taking is not adequate for you. For a good control even aborted attacks should not occur. And on other hand it means that the medication is acting and thats why you didn't have full attack. I don't think it has anything to do with holding breath while sleeping. You can visit your neurologist and he will advice the necessary change in medication. Good luck."},{"Patient":"In the report from a CT scan I had in 2003, it was stated that situated over my right frontal lobe , anterior in its mid portion, I have a low density CSF density lesion which measures about 3.3cm in width and 1.1cm in depth. The report said it was typical of an arachnoid cyst . I have difficulty with my memory , which although I have always been able to mask from my colleagues as I have systems to assist me, I feel it is getting progressively worse. Could this be caused by the above? If such a mass is occupying a space that opperational parts of my brain should be occupying surely this would have some affect. I was dismissed and told it was fine when I received the report but I have always had unanswered questions.","Doctor":"Hello, Generally a arachnoid cyst of the size that you mentioned in frontal lobe would not cause memory problems. If it increases significantly in size (which again is rare), then it can cause problems with memory. None the less there can be causes for your memory problems apart from this cyst. those causes need to be evaluated in you. You will need to consult a neurologist who will examine you and guide further tests and medications if required. Good luck."},{"Patient":"Hi my husband is 41 & had TIA November 2012, he seemed to be recovering well physically but recently I have noticed that he is verr absent minded, insecured & paranoid.

When the fitter turned up on Fridday he didnt know why he was there or which bedroom he needed to go in, there were other things as well. I arranged for him to see a dr & the dr sent him to hospital to get checked out but Luke refused to stay after 3 hrs & discharged himself. Is this normal behaviour following a stroke?","Doctor":"Hello, The behaviour that you have described for your husband is not normal following a TIA. TIA are different from stroke. If you had detailed about the type of symptoms that he had during TIA, then it would have helped me in deciding the relation of these symptoms. He surely needs to go back and be evaluated for these symptoms. He seems to be having forgetfulness which can be seen in temporal lobe stroke apart from many other conditions. Convince him and take him to a neurologist.

I had paradontal surgery done in 2006 to the left side of my mouth, upper and lower. I also had two implants done to the left bottom in which after that I was told later that I had nerve damage. Gradually my bottom lip has started atrophy . I have had a CT and an MRI done in which they note mild atrophy. That was a year and then six months ago. My face is starting to cave in on the left side. My cheek is getting smaller and of course my lip is wasting away too. I was just back in to see my neurologist who still has not diagnosed this yet but instead is wanting me to see a therapist regarding body dismorphic disorder. I have to say also that I was bit by a dog on the top left lip many years ago. My top lip has never looked like it does now and the neurologist never knew me before the nerve damage so it is probably hard for her to say if I actually have this condition.

The problem in elderly individual is generally difficult to handle and a given medical problem can have mutiple causes. Regarding your father, if you are very sure that the problem has started very recently, a medical condition called as delirium needs to be ruled out. This a medical condition which may present similar to your father, provided that the onset of illness is of short duration. As the causes of delirium are so many, your father would require blood tests to rule out any infections, altered liver funtions, kidney functions, CT scan or MRI scan of brain to rule of any tumor/stroke which may explain his problem. The second part of the story is that this illness might have started earlier in a less severe form and might have worsened now. If this is true, a possibility of dementia is high on the card. My advise will be to get the blood tests, liver and kidney function tests, serum sodium, thyroid function including MRI Brain. If all these tests are inconlusive, he may be subjecetd to a detailed neuropsycological evaluation to see if he has dementia or not and we can manage accordingly after establishing the diagnosis. The third part of the story in these types of cases is that a single patient can have both and if delirium is treated properly, he gets back to the previous state.

It is the surrounding areas of the brain which will need to take over the function of the affected part. This will take time and especially in an elderly gentleman like your father, it may not happen completely. Therefore it is possible that he will be left with some extent of permanent paralysis. Once he has come out successfully from the acute hospitalisation he will definitely improve, but the improvement will be gradual and most likely incomplete. Eventully, the doctors will attempt to remove his feeding tube and urinary catheter, ut when it may happen is difficult to predict.

Unfortunately, Parkinson's disease is incurable and despite medical treatment the disease progresses. Therefore he needs to be under regular follow-up with the specialist who will assess whether there needs to be a dose increase in his current medicines or any change to the medicines he is taking. Constipation is a common and troubling side effect with Parkinson's disease. The disease itself causes the constipation and most of anti-parkinson's medicines aggravate it. Therefore, he needs to ensure adequate fibre intake in the diet, adequate fluid intake. Stool softners and laxatives will also help.

Recently in the evening when in my desk I suddenly raise my head , everything in front of me gets rotated .Its for a small time .and I am feeling some pain on the left corner of the back of my head . Is it due to cervical Spondylisis . What should I do - Exercise ? any medicine ?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for writing to us. Cervical spondylosis is a common degenerative condition of the cervical spine and most likely caused by age-related changes in the intervertebral disks. Vertigo (dizziness) with this type of origin usually happen when the head is turned or tilted causing compression of the blood vessels that supply the part of the brain involved in balance. I advice you to wear a soft neck collar during the day to help limit neck motion and reduce nerve irritation. You can take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, Etoricoxib or Diclofen etc. for pain relief and muscle relaxants, particularly if neck muscle spasms occur after discussing with your doctor. Do exercises under guidance of a physical therapist to strengthen neck muscles and stretch the neck and shoulders. When you have episodes of dizziness (vertigo)- Do not lie flat on your back. Prop yourself up slightly to relieve the spinning sensation. Move slowly to avoid the risk of falling. Take rest. Resting will help prevent attacks of light-headedness. Do not drive a motor vehicle, operate equipment, or climb on a ladder while you are dizzy. Do not use substances that can affect your circulation, including caffeine, tobacco, alcohol. Wishing you good health... Regards. Dr Saurabh Gupta."},{"Patient":"I am 31 have not had my cycle for 7 months & am not sexually active.  I have been having pain in my right breast where 2 doctors found a small lump but a mammogram & ultrasound found nothing.  with the pain in my breast it goes to my arm pit and then down my arm.  I am wondering what this could be related to, could it be hormones or something to do with my lymph nodes?","Doctor":"Hi,Breast pain associated with alteration of monthly periods is suggestive of hormonal balance. For the period issue you need to consult your gynecologist.Small lump at this stage is suggestive of fibroadenosis. If the lump expands rapidly then further investigation is required.Otherwise a course of vitamin E and oil of evening primrose capsules is all that is required for at least 6 months.Regards"},{"Patient":"I had an extreme weakness in my right arm and leg on Monday and went to the hospital but they told me that I didn t have a stroke . The symptoms went away and haven t come back. I did have surgery for a serious ear infection in July that (the ear infection) left the left side of my face paralyzed (hopefully temporary), my left ear deaf (again hopefully temporary) and dizziness (again hopefully temporary). I did go to the dizzy therapist on Thursday and did well that day. What happened to me?","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. 1. The extreme weakness of the right arm and leg could be due to a minor brain stroke- called as TIA (transient ischemic attack). In this condition, the weakness improves completely within 24 hours, mostly within 1 hour. However, there is a higher risk of stroke in future, if not adequately treated. If you have any risk factors such as diabetes, high BP, and cholesterol, they should be treated. In addition, you may also require blood thinners such as aspirin. 2. Facial palsy, hearing loss and dizziness are related to ear infection, and they would improve over time.

Based on the symptoms, you are most likely suffering from essential tremors. These tremors tend to get worse with anxiety. Since you also have migraine, you could take beta blockers such as propranolol, as it would help in controlling both tremors and migraine.

Most likely, you are suffering from post-traumatic vertigo. In this condition, after a head injury, dizziness occurs. It may come in episodes. It is not a serious illness, so, there is no need to worry. These symptoms improve over time and may resolve completely within a few weeks. For symptom relief, you may use betahistine tablets.

In September and October I ve suffered from diarrea, vomiting, nausea, headache, heart racing, dizzyness. After taking metrogyl I felt better. Now, since a couple of weeks my throath is sore, ear pain, dizzyness and headaches. My MRI results are the following: Several hyperintense foci are present bilaterally, especially in right semiovale adjacent to body of right lateral ventricle and right ventricle atrium . The largest measures upto 3.8. mm. Some of the larger lesions the show early cyst formation. No acute haemorrhage, haemosiderin or restricted diffusion identified. Some prominence CSF signal along both optic nerves but no overt scleral flattening. Given the age of the patient, demyelination is not excluded. I have a history of of headaches due to infections in my sinuses. Right now, I am extremely worried I have MS. Are the results of my MRI typically MS related? The doctor was in a hurry and I didn t had the time to ask him these questions. Thank you very much! Kind regards, Melanie","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. MRI brain findings in your case are non-specific and not very typical of multiple sclerosis (MS). The commonest reason for multiple hyperintense foci in brain (as in your case) is migraine. Since, you have a history of headaches, the MRI findings could be migraine-related. Other causes of similar MRI lesions could be ischemia (lack of blood flow to brain) and demyelination. Your neurologist would be able to discuss more with you.

The sore throat is unlikely to be due to thyroxine or keppra. You should get yourself examined by a physician about your throat. The problem seems to be related to an infection of throat- viral/bacterial. You should improve the oral health, brush twice a day and do chlorhexidine mouth gargles thrice a day and avoid eating any edibles during ensuing 2 hours to ensure good germicidal effect of chlorhexidine; Do warm saline gargles after you take anything orally. I hope the advise would be informative and useful for you. Take Care!"},{"Patient":"hi I have a one sided severe headache attack which occurs at irregular occasions/intervals. This pain also results in temporary hike in BP (last time it went upto 230) and temporary paralysis (something of that sort: My left arm and leg does not respond at the time of attack). I was advised to take Dicorate ER 750 at the onset of pain. Should I always keep this medicine with me or is there an end to these attacks?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query. From the brief description of your symptoms, a likely cause could be a migrainous headache (which rarely present with transient neurological symptoms like paralysis). Another possibility which has to be considered in this scenarion is a transient ischemic attack (TIA). This is a condition where a person can transietly experience neurological symptoms such as headache, paralysis, etc., which resolve after a brief period. This condition is caused due to a temporary decrease in the blood flow to the brain. A rise in BP can be associated with a migraine as well as a TIA. However a BP of 230 is very high and can be potentially dangerous. I hope you have had a detailed neurological evaluation to rule out any major neurological problems or complications. Dicorate ER (Divalproate sodium) is an anti-epileptic medication which can sometimes be effective in the treatment and prvention of migrainous headache. It is difficult to say how long you will have to continue the medication, since this varies widely from person to person, depending upon the nature and severity of the problem. Wish you all the best.

After this mild neck pain and stiffness started and which over the last year has progressed to severe and seems to be traveling down into the top of my back. I have constant headaches and eyeball pain as well as muscular pain in arms and legs and general fatigue . Recently my numbness sensations have started to happen more frequently again awakening suddenly during the night with one side numb and in pain and causing me to fall, sometimes i just awaken with just my arms numb. I had MRI of BRAIN AND CERVICAL SPINE in March 2012 both were clear. At time of scans i had very MILD neck pain/stiffness and only 1 episode of numbness. Since then they are becoming more and more frequent and my doctor has now diagnosed me with anxiety. Can you still have ms with an all clear mri scan? I do believe i have some anxiety but can this not also be a symptom of MS? Everything i have read, forum after forum its quite clear that doctors miss-diagnose ms all the time and that it is a very hard disease to diagnose. I am also getting physical therapy for the neck with no real affect, and when my pyhsio performed a reflex reactions exam there was no reaction to my left arm, when i told the doctor he completely ignored it.

Fortunately you are not suffering from multiple sclerosis.  It affects functions very severely.  There nothing like a numbness in only one arm or leg. So please forget about MS.

What is more important is to correlate the MRI scan with your symptoms and examination findings to see whether it fits and if so, at which level the problem is at. Neurosurgeons are quite well versed with dealing with degenerative diseases of your cervical spine and you can consult one by all means!

My question is what are my risks and chances to get a blood clot and should I be worried and/or do anything about it?","Doctor":"Hi It is unlikely that a blood clot is the cause of your pain more than 10 years after your operation unless you are on any blood thinning medication like Aspirin/Clipodogrel/Warfarin/Heparin. I would advise you to consult your doctor for a follow-up to see if all is well with the rods and screws and if he/she thinks a  scan is necessary after examining you clinically to rule out any ongoing spinal problem.

Dis you have an open injury to the scalp that caused scarring and therefore the hair there is different? As far as the tingling is concerned, it may be worthwhile to consult a doctor who can get a detailed history and do a clinical examination to see if there are any concerns.

The most common of that is Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV). It is caused by the problems in the inner ear. There are organs for the body balance in the inner ear.

If not operated, the dementia is likely to progressively get worse. A lumbar puncture and draining out fluid will help to predict the response of an operation. Maybe you can consider this before deciding one way or another because it can help you and your father get an idea what the improvement after shunting is likely to be."},{"Patient":"I got my wisdom teeth out on dec 18th, both on the top and one on the bottom left. Recovery has been going ok until today. All stitches (top and bottom) on the left side are very irritated, red and sore. The top stitch is loose and a string is hanging in my mouth. My left cheek is tingling and left teeth are sore. Could I have an infection? I do not have fever and have not noticed any discharge/ pus . I slacked a bit with the salt water rinses since this morning. Is there any chance the tingling is a sign of nerve damage?? the tingling only started a few hours ago.","Doctor":"Hello Julian, Thank you for posting. From your description I can only suggest three possibilities; a local infection or your body has rejected the stitches (thread) or post tooth removal irritation. You will need to visit your dentist to examine the area for infection and the thread. It is possible for the problem to be an infection because the mouth harbors a good number of bacteria ( reservoir for microorganisms) as it is a portal of entry of all microbes. So it is possible plus the fact that you slacked with using salt water that the area has become septic. Appropriate antibiotics would resolve the problem. Pain killer or antiinflammatory should also be included. The 2nd possibility is rejection of the surgical thread by your system. Just like an allergic reaction to the thread. This is usually very rare but a good possibility post surgery. 3rdly is irritation after the removal. This will resolve on its own within a few days. Nerve damage is always present each time any part of your body is bridged by either a trauma or surgically. But that should not call for concern at those levels. You will feel a lot better within a few days. Hope this helps and wish you the best"},{"Patient":"I have done a MRI and it shows Disc bulge with mild disc desiccation impinging upon the thecal sac located at the T11-T12. What does this mean. I fall off a ladder and landed on a filing cabinet. My pain is radiating around to my ribs, chest, and left breast. For some reason they did a MRI on my lumbar but not my thoracic. in my lumbar it showed L4-L5 disc bulge with facetal hypertrophy causing bilateral neuroforminal compromise and the same at L5-S1. Then says the thecal sac ends at S2 and conus termination is at L1 level. Please hep me understand more.","Doctor":"Hi Melissa, Lets start from bottom! As far as where your thecal sac ends and conus terminates, there is nothing to worry because it is normal. You seem to have disc wear and tear at multiple levels. As far as the scan is concerned, the worse level is at the L4/5 and L5/S1 levels. However, the symptoms you describe cannot be explained by the T11/12 or Lower lumbar disc bulges. your symptoms should settle with simple pain killers. As far as your back is concerned, it may be useful to keep it fit and you can consider swimming or another appropriate back strengthening exercise program. Hope this helps!"},{"Patient":"My father is 90 years old. He recently suffered a seizure and developed incoherent speech. Doctors ordered a CT scan and a chest exray.

Please help understand how we can take care of him. If it turns out to be TB, what is the risk to the close family members that are living with him?","Doctor":"Hello Thank you for getting in touch with us. As I see, your father had a seizure recently and developed incoherent speech. This could be due to various reasons like stroke, infection, injury, cancer etc. The exact diagnosis can only be made after conducting a few laboratory and radiological tests. Physical examination of the patient is also of utmost importance here. As he has become forgetful also, it could also be due to the above mentioned reasons or even Alzheimer's. As your Doctor suspects TB, he/she will most probably conduct a few tests to confirm the diagnosis.

As a result i was never able to complete my 3 yr course and have seizures in between. Few days back also i had a seizure. I am on a medication of 4 eptoin 100mg tablets every night. Few days back i gone through phenytoin test and the resulting was 38. Doctor found no symptoms of this excess level in me as i can walk normally my vision is clear. So to verify the report again i went through the same test from different lab but the result was same i.e. 38 . What could be the reason and what can happen to me at this level","Doctor":"Can you please let me know what test was done: Was it is Phenytoin therapeutic level or toxic level? When was the blood sample taken in respect to your dose of medicine? If the level of 38 is a therapeutic level, it means that the drug's level is well above the dose needed for preventing the seizures. it is good that you have been checked for side effects of high blood levels of Phenytoin. What this  means is that the dose of Eptoin can be brought down. If you continue to have Seizure activity inspite of adequate Phenytoin, then your doctor needs to consider whether another medicine needs to be added. Which medicine this is depends on the type of epilepsy that you suffer from. Hope this helps?"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor I have a cyst (small) called pilonidal cleft , on my tail bone that had been oozing out some pus and blood for 3-4 month now and at present, it is more of blood rather than pus. May be because i had been consuming some blood purifiers. I want to know that can I use Nebasulf powder on my cyst to treat it. If not what can i do?","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. As a pilonidal cyst is caused by hair ingrowth, the only way to get rid of it is surgery. Usually such ingrowing hair irritates tissues and causes local inflammation. It leads to abscess and that is why the pus comes from it. None of creams or powders will treat it. You should consult a general surgeon and have simple removal of this cyst. Hope this will help.

I would like to know how often this surgery is succesful and what kind of life after surgery I should expect.","Doctor":"Spinal surgery which includes putting in screws, rods and fusing the listhetic segment is a very common spinal procedure. It can give good relief to pain if done for the correct indication. It is likely to improve the shooting leg pain more than the low back ache. All surgeries carry some risk and here the risks which are to be highlighted are of leak of spinal fluid, damage to the spinal nerve roots causing weakness/bladder or bowel or sexual dysfunction and failure of the operation apart from complications like infection, bleeding etc. In the long term, the risk is of failure of fusion and implant failure. that said, if the operation is performed when correctly indicated and in good hands can provide good pain relief for most patients."},{"Patient":"This is the second time I'm having stabbing pain in my stomach.

It is good that you have not been drinking since the diagnosis. In general drinking is not good for a person who had seizures. Alcohol can increase your predisposition to have seizures. The seizures are caused by abnormal neuronal electrical activity and alcohol can increase that electrical excitability. I would advice you to stay away from alcohol.

I have high TSH levels but normal T3 T4 levels. Could these medications contribute to my Hypothyroidism as well as maybe having a very early hysterectomy contribute to my hypothyroidism. Your opinion would be helpful. Thank you. Tania.","Doctor":"Hello, Epilim is sodium valproate and Neurontin us Gabapentin. These drugs are useful in epilepsy and various other conditions. Like every drug, these drugs also have some common side-effects and some rare ones. However these drugs causing hypothyroidism is not known popularly. Secondly, hypothyroidism is very common among the ladies in 30s and 40s and all the symptoms mentioned by can be explained by hypothyroidism. Though you have normal T3 and T4, raised TSH warrants treatment for hypothyroidism. Your hysterectomy may not have much to do with your current problems.  Hot flushes which you have described can be a sign of menopause. Please visit a physician and start your drugs for thyroid supplementation. Your response to these drugs will also be an indicator for hypothyroidism. Hope I am able to solve your concerns. Thanks.

As far as the granuloma itself is concerned, it in all probability does not require an operation to be removed. The treatment is with anti-convulsant medication which are to be started.  The headache is unlikely to be caused by the granuloma especially of it is a small calcified granuloma with no pressure effect on the surrounding brain. The neck pain is unrelated to this.

Julie Mills","Doctor":"Hello, Probably the nerves supplying your lower feet are getting compressed in the spinal cord in the region of fluid collection. That is why you are getting the pins and needle sensation. One of the options for the treatment is surgical decompression of that region so that fluid is removed and it no longer presses and irritates the nerves. Some medications are also available which reduce such kind of tingling, but they wont tackle the primary problem i.e. fluid collection.

There are a couple of things that you need to be aware of when you have symptoms like cramps in your muscles and aches and pains in your body. The first thing is that your calcium level can be low and it is good to know that your calcium level is normal. But in spite of the fact that your calcium level in the blood is normal I would still suggest that you take over the counter calcium and vitamin D supplements as this may still help you with your aches and pains and muscle spasms. The second thing that you need to know and that is frequently ignored is that not only calcium levels should be monitored after thyroid surgery but magnesium levels are also important and they also need to be monitored. Therefore I would recommend that you should have a magnesium level done as well. If you cannot have that done right away then I would suggest that you should start on over the counter magnesium supplements now as this may help with the pains and cramps that you are having. Another important thing that you should know is that you should monitor your thyroid hormone levels every 6 to 8 weeks until they stabilize because deranged levels of thyroid hormones can also cause symptoms like thing. In addition to calcium and magnesium, potassium levels that are lower than normal can also cause such symptoms to appear. You can try taking a rich potassium diet as well.

I am 19 years old. 5 6 height, about 144 in weight and I take dance class and long walks plus, I do like eating healthy. What I m going to tell you is what I think is wrong with me but you may prove me wrong and give me a better answer so here I go. First off, I have to start off with my first problem, I have Brachial plexus injury in my left arm due to the fact that my doctor pulled me out of my mother s womb when he should of done a c-section. Always he ripped my shoulder tearing a nerve cause me to lose control in my arm. Due to great parent, the worked with my arm so by the age of two I regained control of my left arm again. Though I can only half feel in my arm and half control my arm, I m not that mad about it. However, this is where your going to think I m weird, but please continue to follow with me. Due to being sick for a while I went to a doctor to get some meds. (I did get better but not with the doctors meds just to let you know) Anyways, this doctor, not my normal family doctor,(he was on vacation) keep asking about my period every time I came back to the doctor about the meds. (Big thing is I ve always had a tough time with my period, I was on birth control when I was in grade 9 to help with the heavy cramps and pains during my period, however I ve always had one period that s fine and one that is late over and over again, I never know when I m going to have it. It could be a few days or 2 to 3 weeks after it s due.) So the doctor ask me if my period has started and I told him no, cause this was the one that was always late. So after going to the doctors three times, he gives me the birth control pills for 3 months to take without taking any breaks between them. I m on my 2nd one of the 3 and I am leaking old period stuff. Which comes to the place where your going to think I m strange, I have less control over the whole left side of my body from my head to my left foot . I can do grab and shake faster with my right side then my left side. Example: My right foot I can shake it side to side really fast, and when flex my toes I can feel it, where on my left foot it can t shake as fast as the right and I can only feel half when my toes are flexed. So what I m thinking is that whatever nerve was damaged in my shoulder area cause the less feeling and movement in the left side of my body. Also there are to sacks in which my period is stored one on the right and one on the left. What if this is cause my period to be late every second one and cause to leaking cause I have less control with the sack cause it to do this and not close right. Anyways this is what I think, and I know I could be wrong but I just what to find an answer to this problem and if it can be fixed or not. Thank you. I hope to get your answer very soon. Sarah","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. I appreciate the detailed description that you provided of your symptoms. First, biracial plexus injury can occur as a complication of difficult labor and delivery (shoulder dystocia), where shoulder of the baby comes out before the head. Treatment is with exercises, and I am glad to note that you have done well. Second, regarding the weakness of left side, it needs evaluation. It could be due to clotting of blood in the brain veins or arteries. An evaluation by a neurologist and a possible MRI of brain may be useful. Regarding the periods being irregular, it is most likely due to a condition called as dysfunctional uterine bleeding. The suspicion that your blood is stored in two sacs, etc is not correct.

Here is the result of the MRI. 1.Multiple scattered punctate foci of T2/Flair hyperintensities within the subcortical white matter are more than expected for patient s age (39) but nonspecific. These may reflect sequela of migraine headaches, mild age-advanced microvascular ischemic disease if the the patient has known vascular risk factors, or remote infectious/inflammatory etiology. 2. Left Choroial fissure cyst 1.5 x .8 x .7cm is an incidental finding of no clinical significance 3.

You are most likely having what is called as hypnic jerks. These are a form of myoclonic jerks that happen when one is asleep. This is something that is normal and nothing to worry about a great deal. In fact this is something that is very common and even I experience them myself. The findings that you are having on your MRI is not something that concerns me and this should not be causing you the myoclonic jerks by any stretch of the imagination. Therefore I would recommend that you should just relax as there is nothing a great deal to worry about. Kindest Regards. Dr. Zia.

The doctor stiched me and the last of my stitches are being removed in a days time(10days after the accident). The bigger cut that lies directly between my thumb and the index finger towards the centre of the palm caused numbness of the two finger since the day of the accident till now. I started on neoroton tablets yesterday but the pain from the numn fingers for the past 3days is unbearable! My questions are; Will I be able to regain feelings in those fingers, can the pain be stopped or reduced and if yes , how?? Can. I do physiotherapy on my own, how long will it take for me to be completely well, what medical condition is this, what other advice do yoy have for me?","Doctor":"Hello, Numbness and pain in your fingers (this type of pain is known as neuropathic pain) is caused by a transection of the nerve that supplies these two fingers. The common branch lies in the center of the palm from which the branches separate and go on to supply the fingers. Tablets can only help in relieving you from the neuropathic pain though not completely but they have no role whatsoever in regaining sensation. You should get in touch with a plastic surgeon as early as possible because accurate nerve repair is the key to regaining sensation over the numb areas and would take place over months after repair. In the absence of nerve repair, there would be a very slow regain of protective sensation only over a span of many months and that too is incomplete."},{"Patient":"I am suffering for allergic cold in every winter season. But from last 3 years, i also experienced vertigo in winter seasons. I visited so many doctors i.e. physician, ENT specialist and Ayurveda doctors. Some of them told me i have vestibular neuronitis , some told me that this is due to infection in my inner ear . After so many medications also, i used to feel light headedness or dizziness or numbness in my head in all winter season. Now a days, one strange thing is being started to make me in more trouble that is vertigo attack when i get angry. I mark that all time when i got angry on someone , shouted on someone, i got attack of vertigo immediatedly which usually last for 10 to 15 minutes. Now i am worrying what to do?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to health care magic forum, It is possible that when allergic cold is more then ti may affect to ear and cause vertigo. As cold coryza decrease vertigo also decreased. Anger and vertigo correlation is possible. And homeopathic treatment is mainly based on that (physical and mental symptoms correlation and analysis). allergy is surely curable with homeopathic treatment. So consult to good homeopath for proper treatment.

The most likely possibility in your case could be a transient ischemic attack- TIA. In this condition, the blood supply to a part of brain is reduced for a short period of time. This is more likely to occur in presence of risk factors such as diabetes, high BP, cholesterol, smoking, etc. You may get screened for these risk factors. Cervical spine problems may lead to weakness of both arms, but the numbness of jaw can not occur with spinal problem. You may consult a neurologist for evaluation.

It is fortunate that your wife survived the suicidal attempt with hanging. Hanging leads to lack of oxygen flow to the brain, which causes damage to several parts of brain. Hippocampus, the seat of memory in brain, is very sensitive to damage with hypoxia (low oxygen supply). This results in memory loss and behavioural changes, which your wife has now. These tend to improve slowly over time and may occur over the next 1-2 years. Recovery, however, may be incomplete. A drug piracetam may be useful in improving memory and speech.

What precautions needs to be taken and is it a medical emergency situation?","Doctor":"Dear Concerned., Thanks for writing to us. In a c/o Cerbral AVMs ,in addition to Cyberknife ,radiological embolisation as an adjunctive therapy also. The Cyberknife allows delivery of high doses of targeted radiation with sub-millimeter accuracy, such that the lesion's surrounding normal brain is subjected to very minimal harm. Such accuracy is critical for preserving as much brain function as possible.Most patients experience minimal recovery time and can return to normal activities following their treatment. Depending on the tumor type, size and location, many patients need only one treatment with the Cyberknife to destroy their tumor. Before the Cyberknife Surgery.,the patient will be admitted for observation, then taken for CT navigated embolization procedure for reducing the blood supply the size of the lesion. Before a patient is treated he or she may undergo a series of tests such as MRI, functional MRI, CT, and CT angiography. A multidisciplinary team of physicians including a neurointerventionalist, neuroradiologist, neurosurgeon, and stroke neurologist carefully review this data to propose the best plan. The process of embolisation is done under general anaesthesia.An artery in the groin is punctured and catheterised so that guide catheter is pushed upto the neck and up into blood vessels supplying the AVM. Embolus producing agents are then injected into blood vessels supplying the AVM so that the clot artificially produced will block blood supply to AVM and the same regresses in size. As an elective procedure the patient will stay for 03-05 days. The embolization is done in stages to prevent thrombosis and haemorhages from occuring in normal parts of the brain. After regressing of AVM lesion , adjunctive Cyberknife therapy and Radiation therapy is done to achieve total removal of AVM.

I had not eaten so I ordered for some food then that seemed settled. However 3 hours down the line I was not feeling dizzy but rather as if people were far. I could hear people talking, they are near me, but I could hear as if they were far away. We dropped business for the evening and went to hospital: Aga Khan, Mombasa. Tests on Malaria , pressure yielded nothing. But the feeling never went. It was a strange feeling like losing balance, it was originating may be from the stomach, my neck was also a bit painful, I would feel my hand moving involuntarily occasionally. When I went finally to see a doctor after going through extra malaria drugs, I was given Stugeron to control the imbalance and something for the neck pain ...cartilaginous stuff (prescribed by an orthopaedist). 6 months down the line there was still no change. I would now find it difficult to attend meetings as my head would be full, I would not talk for long as I developed anger feelings etc. (I was a strong theatre person, play director and master of ceremonies) so everyone started getting worried. My physician sent me for an EEG (that brain thing) and the EEG was indicative of a generalized epileptiform discharge. I was not comfortable in a crowded place, a noisy place etc. Do not forget my weight was also over board so Type II was at the corner. My stomach still remained a problem and the physician concluded that it could be gastro intestinal epilepsy but could not confirm. He none the less put me on epilim . I went to see a neuro-surgeon in March 2007 in Aga Khan University hospital in Nairobi to seek a second opinion. He performed a brain scan using NMR or MRI? That noisy tube. I had to be there under mild anaesthesia because I could not lie still due to that imbalance. And he ordered for all tests under the moon on my blood and body organs. HIV was negative but he said diabetes was positive though my sugar levels were 6 to 7. His optician gave me specs. I went to Aga Khan seeing normally. Liver, spleen heart, ear etc were ok. All tests in the brain were negative. He performed an EEG but I never saw the results. He discontinued Epilim. Then he brought a dietician who insisted I lose weight. She proposed a diet for a 10 year old and prescribed 1000 mg glucophage (500 in the morning and 500 in the evening). My stomach problem which was a source of my imbalance was still there. We have come to realize it was acidity. But again it is NOT!! This treatment for 3 months kept my sugar at starvation levels of 4 to 6. The lab technician who was measuring my sugar once in Mombasa refused to buy the diabetes story and insisted that if it is true then for such levels, a diet control and not medication is enough. One evening after seeing my blood sugar at 4.7 he called and told me not to take the medicine. Infact he insisted that this diet plus the medicine will interfere with my internal body organs as they were not necessary. I e–mailed my sugar levels to my first physician who is a diabetes expert. He asked me to see him urgently the following day and wondered why I had not collapsed. I explained to him what happened in Aga Khan NRB etc. He pulled me out of glucophage. Then after 2 weeks, my stomach just started feeling empty as if it was hollow. The imbalance due to stomach hollowness and was unbearable. I was back on a 500mg tablet of gluophage. He pulled me out of the diet as well. He performed a glucose tolerance test and realized my sugar was low and needed to be brought up. He put me on glucobay whose side effects is gas. Sugar went up as fasting was now 5.8 to 6.4 but post prandial (2 hr after dinner) would be 9 to 11. Now 2 things happened: Gas became a problem and the imbalance was not going away. I went back to the neurosurgeon who sent me to a gastroenterologist since the brain according to his tests, some sent as far as Germany was OK. The gastroenterologist advised substitution of glucobay to reduce gas.. I went back to glucophage. He gave me Mebiz and Senokot for the stomach. I was still uncomfortable. I was working from home. In 2008 August, I made my first trip to Nairobi on official duty. We used our office car. I reached but that effect of not being comfortable in a crowd was there. Remember I am off Epilim still. We are dealing with mild diabetes. One week after returning to Mombasa, the feeling of that strange imbalance and hyper acidity in the stomach and gas returned. (Oily diet in Nairobi probably). I went to my physician. He referred me for another EEG. It was still indicative of generalized epileptiform discharge!! We were wrong to stop epilim but the MRI or NMR never showed. The physician said EEG deals with reactions, MRI is just photos!!With that he gave Epilim Chrono which Iwas still on till 2010-. I went to work the following day and have been there since. I went to the gastroenterologist to sort out this acidity and gas problem. He thought of Irritable bowel syndrome. He did a colonscopy, saw a polyp in the colon that was benign. My physician said IBS symptoms are far from what I have. He feels had we been on Epilim all that time, we could be far since such treatments take 3 years!!!! My gastroenterologist has sent me to another neurologist for another EEG to be sure. I have not gone. I am tired. The problem I have now is the slight imbalance, being unable to talk much and that gas here and there but I am improving. Now you see why I cannot use a mobile phone for long. The condition according to my physician is “Complex partial seizure” expressed in the gut and My gastroenterologist thinks it is Irritable bowel syndrome. I am not on a diet but only avoid sugar, oil, salt. Was advised to use vegetable salad as fillers. Recently (April 2009) I was in Bondo for a retreat for 4 days. We came by air. So I avoid places. I had never been admitted before, was never on medication etc. Have you given up? No my last neurosurgeon also ruled out epilepsy. He put me on Olanzapin because anytime now I would hear music from radio, laptop etc I would feel my head getting very full and very uncomfortable. This is worse for music from a laptop or computer till now. When I wear a trouser that fits a bit tightly, my head gets full. Nothing should touch the stomach. I was given neuro-forte and got a relief. But the problem is back. WHAT WAS NEURO-FORTE RELIEVING? THAT IS THE PROBLEM.

Your physician was right in saying that the MRI donot show a seizure discharges and its only the EEG which shows seizure discharges. If EEG is showing it, there is no doubt why you shouldn't be on anti epileptic. Valproate and levetiracetam are two good anti epileptics and you should try them if not recovering. If symptoms do not improve with them, only then some antipsychotics may help you. Now that you are in India, we would advice you to take a neurologist consultation in India with all your old records.

I have gone through the report of your MRI of cervical spine. I would like to first reassure you that there are no serious problems noted in the MRI. The reports suggest degenerative and post-operative changes. There is no significant compression of any of the cervical nerves. Based on the reports, you require only conservative management such as medications (pregabalin, etc) for nerve pain; and physiotherapy. Wishing you good health, Dr Sudhir Kumar MD DM (Neurology)"},{"Patient":"a friend of mine has had multiple shunts put in his brain, since 7 years of age. He is 33 now. Family is very worried about him. He drinks and smokes. Could this be contributing to the failure of the shunts? I have heard that people with a shunt in their brain to drain the fluid should not drink alcohol or smoke because it can cause pressure and the shunt could lift, causing a leak.","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. First of all, I would like to reassure you that shunts can be kept in the brain ventricles for a long period of time without any problems. The two most common problems with long-term shunt tubes are 1. shunt infection, and 2. shunt dysfunction. However, these complications are not directly linked to smoking and alcohol consumption. But smoking and alcohol can lead to other health hazards, such as cancer, heart disease, brain stroke, liver disease, etc, so, I would suggest that your friend stops smoking and consuming alcohol.

Is this normal ? Why does this happen ?","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Brain stroke is a major cause of disability. However, your mother would show gradual improvement in her weakness over time, with good physiotherapy. Spontaneous movements of the paralysed side can occur due to what is called reflex movements. Sometimes, tone in the affected limb can increase, which can cause flexor spasms. Both these situations are normal and there is no need to worry. In rare cases, there could be focal fits in the affected side, where there would be jerky movements. This condition requires medications.

I woke up an hour or so ago and both my legs and both my arms are tingling . Is this cause for concern? Do I need to go back to the ER?","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for posting your query. The initial problem with which you went to the ER is suggestive of nerve compression in the lumbar (lower back) region. This is commonly caused by the prolapse (bulging) of the disc. Common symptoms include lower back pain, pain in the legs, tingling, numbness, etc. It can be diagnosed with the help of MRI. If symptoms persist, you can get the MRI done. Your second problem of tingling of arms is probably not serious and is due to compression of nerves while sleeping. It should recover in a short span of time and there is no need to go back to the ER.

Your son has had three episodes of typical febrile seizures. There is no need of using any daily anti epileptic drugs at this moment. Febrile seizures are harmless and they do not lead to epilepsy in future.

For a patient with seizure, these are the do's and don'ts: 1. Take medications regularly, without fail.

In addition, physiotherapy such as IFT/ultrasound and back extension exercises are also useful. Best wishes, Dr Sudhir Kumar MD DM (Neurology) drsudhirkumar@yahoo.com"},{"Patient":"Hi.

A scale of 7 out of 15 indicates a severe head injury, and only 20% people have good neurological recovery in this condition. As of now (even after two weeks), your friend is unconscious (responding only to painful stimuli). This also indicates a poor chance of good meaningful recovery.

Most likely, your symptoms are not suggestive of paralytic stroke. However, in view of your symptoms being one-sided, we should screen for any risk factors for stroke. These include testing for BP, Sugar, cholesterol and homocysteine. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause numbness of hands and feet, and it responds very well to treatment.

Your doctor was correct. Calcified granuloma in the brain suggests a healed infection (due to tape worm). No treatment is required for the healed infection, however, it can cause fits.

The findings reported on your MRI are commonly seen in patients with migraine and there is no need to worry about them. However, if you have frequent migraine headaches, you should be on preventive medications. In a person, who has risk factors such as diabetes, high BP, cholesterol, in them, these findings could mean ischemia (lack of blood flow to the brain) and then medications such a aspirin may be required.

I am suffering from seizure disorder. My MRI and EEG reports are normal. Right now my doctor told me to take one levipil 500 in morning and 2 in the night. I am an alcoholic. I am trying to overcome this problem. Please advice me Something so that i can take small amount of alcohol because it is quite difficult for me to immediately stoping the alcohol consumption. Thank You","Doctor":"Hello. I'm Dr. Christensen. Your situation is complicated. People who drink heavily every day and then suddenly stop drinking can develop alcohol withdrawal, which frequently causes seizures. Occasionally, an alcoholic who is having a seizure due to alcohol withdrawal is mistakenly diagnosed with a seizure disorder. This is more likely to occur when a patient doesn't tell the doctor about his alcoholism, so the doctor assumes the seizure is due to a seizure disorder and prescribes medications to prevent more seizures. On the other hand, alcohol alters the electrical activity of your brain, so drinking alcohol when you do have a seizure disorder can increase your chances of having a seizure. In addition, alcohol tends to interact with many anti-seizure medications, often with undesirable consequences (excessive fatigue, difficulty breathing, confusion, etc.) If you're used to drinking alcohol every day, you should not suddenly stop drinking, as this could precipitate alcohol withdrawal and cause seizures. (In fact, alcohol withdrawal can be fatal.) However, you can probably safely reduce your alcohol consumption by about half. Call your doctor immediately to discuss the best way to overcome your alcoholism while simultaneously dealing with your seizure disorder. Until you have discussed this problem with your doctor, don't make any changes in your medications. I hope that helps, and good luck!"},{"Patient":"my father aged 66 years suffering from cerebellum stroke , since july, 2009 and in under medication . Day before yesterday he took 4 sleeping pills ( lonazep MD 1 mg) .Today morning he was found unconsious beneath the bed.I would like to know whether I need to change the medication or not and what are the preventive measures that has to be taken.","Doctor":"Hello. I'm Dr. Christensen. I'm sorry your father is having problems. There are several issues to be addressed here. It isn't clear what your father's usual level of function is, nor is it clear what his usual dose of clonazepam is. If he inadvertently took 4 pills of Lonazep, this medication should be kept out of his reach, and the proper dose should be dispensed at the appropriate time. As for your father's episode of unconsciousness, this could have resulted from taking too much Lonazep. This drug has a long half-life, so it stays in your bloodstream for several days, which can be particularly troublesome for elderly individuals. It's also possible your father had another stroke; this, too, could cause unconsciousness. I suggest you have your father evaluated by his doctor. Once it is clear what led to this incident, it would be wise to put all of his medications in a \\"pill tender\\" so they can be dispensed according to the doctor's instructions. If necessary, it might also be a good idea to get a hospital bed or some other type of bed with rails that can be raised so your father can't accidentally fall out of bed or wander at night. I hope that answers your question, and I hope your father does well."},{"Patient":"Hi, I was in a car accident 2 months ago and I hit my head.

The tubercular infection of the lungs is highly infectious and it spreads to others via fomites. In cases associated with sputum production are also very infectious. In contrast, tuberculosis of other sites like spine (bone) and brain/ meninges is not as infectious as pulmonary tuberculosis. Treatment with anti-tubercular drugs is required to render the infected person non-infectious. A minimum of one month treatment is needed for this. To be on the safer side start the treatment and after continue it for 2 weeks to 4 weeks. try to avoid sexual contact for this period.

The pain and numbness are getting progressively worse.","Doctor":"Hello. I'm Dr. Christensen. I'm sorry you're so uncomfortable. As you've discovered, cervical stenosis can be resistant to treatment, especially when multiple levels are affected (as in your case). Cymbalta is one of several medications that are used for conditions like yours. Pregabalin (Lyrica) and gabapentin (Neurontin) are other examples of medications used to treat pain caused by damaged nerves. It usually takes several weeks to determine whether or not these drugs will be helpful for a given patient. Unfortunately, most patients have at least some residual discomfort even when the medications work well. Therefore, other modalities -- physical therapy, acupuncture, core strengthening, chiropractic manipulation, etc. -- should also be explored. Some patients do eventually need surgery when all other options fail to reduce their pain. Cymbalta is generally well tolerated, but it does have some side effects. The most commonly reported ones are nausea, fatigue, dizziness, constipation and insomnia. Young adults using this medication may experience suicidal thoughts. Some patients have suffered from liver damage while taking Cymbalta, and this drug could cause serotonin syndrome (an uncommon side effect characterized by agitation, tremors, rapid heart rate, sweating, flushing, diarrhea and sometimes seizures). Finally, Cymbalta should not be discontinued abruptly, as this could lead to a withdrawal syndrome (insomnia, electric shock-like sensations, agitation, confusion and headache). If you and your doctor decide Cymbalta is no longer indicated, you should taper your dosage gradually. I hope that answers your question, and I hope you feel better soon."},{"Patient":"Hi. good morning, My name is Rathu, and recently I have had a bleeding right eye, and having checked with an eye surgeon, was informed that nothing is wrong with my eye, except that there might be some other issues and should do certain blood tests.

In the meantime, drugs like Gabapentin which raise the pain threshold may be tried - discuss with your GP and get appropriate prescription.

Thanks for your query. I understand that you are going through a difficult time. Your symptoms of memory and concentration difficulties, lack of interest, feeling dull, decreased energy, etc. could be indicative of depression. They don't appear to be unrelated to your having more sex. I would advise you to consult a psychiatrist for a detailed psychological assessment and further treatment. There are effective treatment options for this, in the form of medication or counselling / psychotherapy which will help you overcome your problems. You can deal with your gastric problems by having your meals on time and avoiding spicy or oily foods, carbonated or caffeinated drinks, etc. You can take an over the counter antacid for quick relief. If the symptoms don't subside with these simple measures, then you may need to see a doctor for further treatment. Regular physical exercise and diet control in order to reduce weight will help both your physical as well as psychological problems.

Chronic and recurring headaches may or may not be related to her neurological conditions. I am sure a brain scan was performed during the events in the past. If the scans are normal, then it is unlikely to be related to the seizure. There are other causes such as migraine, sinusitis, tension headaches, rebound headaches, refractory errors, etc., which can give rise to constant and recurring headaches. I wonder what your wife has is one among these. All the aforementioned conditions are easily treatable with medications and life style changes. I encourage you to consult her neurologist. Detailed evaluation can help us narrow down to a single possibility. We can take up the treatment from there.

Abnormal position during sleep can cause compression of neurovascular structures resulting in tingling, discomfort and pain. The symptoms can last for few minutes to days depending on the amount of nerve damage. These phenomena can explain the symptoms you had in the upper limbs, while I am unable to explain the lower limb weakness too. If a definite weakness is documented by your doctor, then you would need to get a CT / MRI scan of the brain and rule out intracranial pathology such as ischemia / demyelination. A specific treatment can be planned based on the results of scan. If no significant / clinically co-relating pathology is found, then we may attribute these symptoms to anxiety and stress. Hence a scan is mandatory. Discuss with your treating doctor. Hope this information suffices.

You can visit one of them and they can assess you for those functions of brain. It is difficult to say whether the memory problems are due to Eptoin or due to routine aging in your case.

Shortly after that i went to the mens room and thats went I started to sweat like crazy....cold sweat. I thought something was wrong with my food I tried to put my finger down my throat I throw it all out but unsuccessful. After about 30 mins I did the same thing again and manage to throw out and almost cleared my stomach then I felt better. Was it my food or maybe the water I drank, thank you.","Doctor":"Dear Concerned., Thanks for writing to us. Basically to maintain the Biorhythm an individual needs to sleep for 06to 08 hours a day. Otherwise there will be definitely increase in blood pressure. The initial symptom of cold sweat and dizzyness could have been a result of sudden variation in BP as a result of lack of sleep.This is  physiological or normal phenomenon. You have not mentioned regarding whether you have passed urine when you went to rest room. sudden evacuation of bladder in such a situation will lead  to gushing of blood to the urinary bladder musculature depriving the brain from its blood supply for seconds as the urine passes out and the bladder musculature normals in thickness(In its maximum capacity the bladder would  balloon out to store urine upto 750 ml almost obliterating its own blood supply if you withhold passing urine).The sudden crazy unable to stand and you had to sit up was due to a Condition called Micturition Syncope. It is almost always Physiological or normal phenomenon. Now you may ask why the condition improved after you have thrown up the Gastric contents.You have relieved the Gastro intestinal System from the work load and the blood supply was restored to the Nervous system. Again Physiological and it was untimely food in all probability. I am giving you only the probability as I have only read the history and not examined you physically. In both cases ie.,the root cause seems to be due to sudden change in your Biorhythm/lack of sleep.It does not seem to be due to quality of Food or water Per Se but due to irregular sleep/eating  pattern.Kindly help yourself with normal sleep. In the event of non improvement kindly consult a locally available General Physician for a complete evaluation. Get well soon.

I'm sorry your uncle is ill. Without more detailed information about his condition, it is very difficult to offer you any meaningful advice. Unfortunately, many forms of dementia are irreversible and gradually progressive despite the best treatment.

Keeping your uncle's diabetes under control may also help to delay worsening of his condition, but dementia is usually incurable. In many cases, the best we can do is keep our loved ones as comfortable and safe as possible; this may require assistance from non-family members (live-in caregivers, for example).

Regardless of your past history of conversion disorder, your symptoms warrant further investigation. One-sided weakness and dysesthesias (abnormal sensations) could indicate a number of serious disorders, including a stroke, multiple sclerosis, central nervous system sarcoidosis, or even a brain tumor. The fact that you awakened with these symptoms is concerning, as is the fact that you're exhibiting unusual motor activity while you're sleeping.

I just did MRI Sep. My MRI report shows my L4-5 there is a diffuse disc bulge with a small left paracentral/foraminal disc herniation with mild facet hypertrophy . This causes left-sided lateral recess stenosis with compression of the descending left side s1 nerve root . Can this problem completely heal?","Doctor":"Thank for the query. The first issue to be addressed is if the MRI findings are due to the fall or if that were already there before the fall. Facet hypertrophy may be constitutional or due to degeneration. Disk bulge and herniation may be caused by trauma, but it could be already there - did you ever had any sort of left sciatic pain? True disk herniation usually causes an inflammatory reaction that may lead to its resorption and cure. However, if their parent disk is already dessicated, they won´t resolve. Facet hypertrophy is a permanent condition due to its origin. Just a comment on your MRI report - it is unlikely that a L4-5 disk herniation might cause S1 nerve root compression. This is because, within the L5 lateral recess, resides the L5 root, not S1 (just a minor mistake) Best wishes,"},{"Patient":"My son 17 yrs old had just got seizures 20 days back and was done MRI and MRI Veno.

They gave me a shot of muscle relaxant and pain killer into my shoulder, which helped the pain and tension. I believe I also have fibromyalgia in my right shoulder. The slipped disc is right between my shoulder blades. I have three other areas of extreme pain as well: cervical, thoracic and lower lumbar. I m beginning to think I have some sort of degenerative disease , and this scares me very much. I forgot what it was like to sleep without pain. I don t take any pain killers. I try to do yoga, but if I pinch something, I can t move for on average three days. I want to cry all the time. I can t sit, stand, nor lie down. It hurts to lie down. I also feel like I have headaches because the nerve that is pinched runs from between my shoulder blades and radiates outward to my right shoulder and the very top of my neck on the right side. How can I correct this? Will I ever regain my health and well-being? Will I ever feel like normal again, before the accident?","Doctor":"hello madam, here is cure for your complains you are at right platform. you said you dont want to take pain killer.using  psin killers is likeonly superficial treatment. you also doing yoga we will guide for that which aasan(position) is good in such complaints.otherwise its harmful if you do that without consulting any expert. there is therapy in ayurveda for such painful cases. its a vaatvyadhi.ayurvedic vati and oil are helpful for that.several patient get relief by using our ailment. this medicine give relief from pain without any side effect unlike pain killers also enhance your nevrous system.restore your abiliy(neck movement etc) basti (special treatment of vatvyadhi)local and regular one also useful in it. follow it ask us for consultation in detail. it will surely brink back smile on your face. have a nice day tc"},{"Patient":"I am a healthy 46 year old female.

Dairy products 7. Alcohol and smoking You can look out which triggers your attack and can avoid it. MRI is usually normal in migraine. Taking Paracetamol along with Domperidone is helpful.

It is a commonly used medication for seizure control. The propensity to cause seizure is more in a few patents with a particular type of epilepsy (seizures).

Rather this constellation of symptoms would strongly suggest such malformation. Along with the chiari malformation of the brain there may be bony abnormality of the craniovertebral junction which can cause some of the symptoms like neck pain. Cerebellar tonsils may be herniated and causing pressure on structures of brain and spinal cord. MRI is the best and reliable investigation for chiari. good luck."},{"Patient":"1 of my very close has the following problem. i will explain as far he has told me. spines c5,c6 to c7 or c8 has been detected problem.

In between pieces, there is disc. If disc becomes weak, bone may slip. The spinal cord is inside the spine. Nerves go out between the pieces. So slip may press the cord or the nerve.  The nerve may become weak. Pressure on cord can cause paralysis. So you have to see nerve specialist - to prevent or treat.

My family doctor ordered an MRI that revealed an angioma in the front left lobe and innumerable nodules in the white matter of the brain. The radiologists thought it to be evidence of MS. Because I show no symptoms of MS, my doctor referred me to a neurologist . Physical exam - she felt I did not display symptoms of MS, but definitely inner ear problems. She ordered another MRI of my spine , catscan of my brain and numerous blood tests. Still no sign of MS. An Interventional Neuro-radiologist on the team recommended a cerebral angiogram to determine whether I had a venous angioma and/or if it had a fistual on it. This test confirmed no presence of a fistula, just a venous angioma. I have a brother who had a brain bleed in 2009. I was so bad moved the brain over 3 inches. He was found at home unconscious, rushed to emergency and a crainiotomy (sp) was performed. His recovery took 3 months, but he is with us, thank God!!! Wondering if either the venous angioma and the nodules/lesions in the white matter of the brain could be causing my symptoms: Some headaches (left side) the chronic dizzyness and syncope.

I appreciate any insight you give me on this.","Doctor":"Hello, Venous angioma could be a cause of intracranial bleed and also it can be familial. Condition which comes to my mind when you say of headache, white matter nodules and family history is CADASIL. Its a  relatively rare disease. Tests are available for confirming it.

If it is causing any weakness then surgery is definitely recommended. If pain is uncontrolled then also surgery can be considered. other methods of treatment are strict bed rest and physical therapies. Some times injections at the local area can also give prolonged relief. The type of surgery is determined by the location of the disc bulge. Basically the part of disc which is compressing on the nerves is cut and removed.

A spinal surgeon sees the scan and the patient and takes a decision regarding need for operation. Another alternative used is strict bedrest for 10-14 days, which also has been known to relieve disc bulge and pain. There are physical therapy measures which can build up back muscles and prevent recurrence of such problem. good luck."},{"Patient":"Respected Sir, Myself Reeta Sachdev from Nagpur.

Unconsciousness for 20 days following a injury is very long and indicates poor chances of functional recovery. The doctor must have assessed the brain functions by means of examination before communicating to you that it is not functioning properly. The decision to take him home remains with you.

Complex partial seizures respond well to medications such as tegretol. Please ensure he is on adequate dosage (10-20 mg per kg body weight per day), which means if he weighs 60 kg, he should be taking 600 mg at least. If his seizures are not under control, it can be increased to 1200 mg. He should be regularly taking the medicines, and should not skip it, for best results. In addition, he should sleep for 7-8 hours at nights and avoid any major stress/tension. I am sure, his seizures can be brought under good control.

Based on your description above, we know that your brother has a problem in the brain and has fits. First of all, he needs to be started on anti-epileptic medications, with which his fits can be brought under control. Next, you have mentioned that there is swelling in brain.

The symptoms of giddiness get aggravated with movements of head and neck in this condition. For relief of symptoms, betahistine is helpful.

I have gone through your symptoms and it may be reassuring for you to note that there is no serious problem with your brain. There are two possibilities: 1. Concussion- related to the accident and head injury. This can lead to confusion, forgetfulness and behavioural changes. However, these are transient and you would completely recover within 6-12 weeks. 2. Anxiety neurosis- as you have also mentioned, many of these symptoms could be because of anxiety. You may require anxiolytics medications such as clonazepam and counselling. Please consult a psychiatrist or psychologist if you do not improve.

Can surgury help the buttock pain? I have tried the steroid , neurontin without effect. Forget the pain meds those aren t the answer. My doctor said that I will have to live with the pain. OMG I hope not","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for contacting Healthcare magic. First of all, I wish to reassure you that your pain would reduce with treatment and you won't have to live with pain. Following measures would be helpful: 1. Physiotherapy- back extension exercises, pain relief measures such as IFT/Ultrasound/traction, etc. I have seen many people get well with them. 2. Avoid forward bending and lifting heavy weights. 3. I would agree with you that repeat surgery may not work, and hence you should not go for it at this stage. Also, second surgery is technically more difficult. 4. Some people get relief with neuropathic pain medications, such as pregabalin.

During the Alegretto procedure, I did not feel anything until the flap was being smoothed back in place on my right eye. I could feel pain with the pressure (5 out of 10). When I went home to rest (I was told to just take a nap) I had significant pain to my R eye. About a 7.5 out of 10.(counter intuitive to napping) I phoned to see if this was normal, and was told it was. I felt pretty pain free until about a month later when I started getting headaches . . . I still get them about once a week. I was told they are cluster headaches. (very painful) I will be having an MRI next week to help R/O other etiologies. I do not have facial pain, or nausea with the HAs. I have been reading about occipital neuralgia . I feel these are the symptoms I am having. Especially with occipital lobe pain, neck stiffness/pain, and R eye pain. Is it possible the doctor could have damaged my occipital nerve pressing on my newly fried eye during lasik? And maybe I didn t feel pain the first month as the nerve was healing . . . . I dunno . . . what are your thoughts? This is all new for me. I rarely even got garden variety HAs before lasik, and now I have these horrible episodes which have literally changed my life. (had to quit job) And furthermore I am back in glasses d/t unsuccessful outcome.","Doctor":"Hi, I can understand your discomfort because of repeated headaches and the unsuccessful outcome of LASIK. However, I would like to reassure you that the chance of any nerve damage during LASIK is remote. Also, the fact that regular headaches started almost a month after the procedure rules out any role of eye procedure in causing the headaches. Headaches are unrelated to the eye problem/procedure and could be due to migraine/cluster headache. I hope your MRI comes as normal.

Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is a fully treatable condition and the infection gets healed with albendazole. In your case, brain scan has been done, which has confirmed that the brain infection has healed. NCC is not like epilepsy. In epilepsy, one has to continue medicines for long time, sometimes even lifelong. But in NCC, once the infection has completely healed, one can stop the anti-epileptic medications. So, I would recommend that you follow your doctor's advice and gradually taper and stop valproic acid. In very rare cases, fits may occur later, when we can always re-start valproic acid.

Arachnoid cyst in the brain can be present since birth in most cases, but it comes to light only when MRI or CT of the brain is done. Arachnoid cyst contains fluid (cerebrospinal fluid) and it is not a tumor. Arachnoid cyst most commonly causes headache or fits. For fits, anti-epileptic medications are required. In most cases, surgery is not required. Surgery is only required if the arachnoid cyst starts pressing on the normal brain tissues. So, I agree with your doctor's approach. Repeat MRI would show whether the cyst in enlarging or whether it is pressing on the adjacent brain tissue. So, at present no need to worry and child need not restrict any activity. I hope it helps.

An ambulance was called and she was taken to Humber River Regional. Initial blood tests indicated her serum sodium had fallen to 109 mEq. She then had another brief episode and was put on a solution of 3% NaCl. Over the next four days her levels went 129. At this point, all I.V.s were stopped and she was monitored over the next 2-3 days. On the day of her discharge (August 27th) she had stabilized and was self regulating with a sodium reading of 134 mEq. Two of her hypertension management medication were discontinued (Spirolactonr and Indapamide). Though the sodium was managed and started balancing out during her last few days, her level of anxiety/ depression had increased. Currently she is dealing with dyphagia, weakness of her legs and arms, sleepy/drowsy felling throughout the day, anxiety and delirium . This all indicates she may have Osmotic demyelination syndrome ( Central pontine myelinolysis ).

I had developed a bleeding cyst on an ovary and the blood pooled around my vaginal cuff-incision. The vaginal cuff broke and my bowel started protruding. The Dr removed the damaged ovary and part of the bowel that adhered to the ovary and then stitched up the cuff. At my last post-op visit, my sutures all had dissolved and my surgeon said I was 100% healed. A couple of weeks later, I developed a milky, sometimes yellow vaginal discharge and a foul vaginal odor. It seemed to temporarily go away with the use of a douche . Now, the interesting part...a week ago i experienced a syncope , passed out and went right into a 2 minute grand mal seizure. the only indication of something being wrong before it happened was a feeling of being flushed--a hottness from the inside out. After numerous tests, I was released from the hospital with no true diagnosis. Today, 7 days after the seizure, that hottness from the inside out returned and it felt like hot flashes or a fever. Simultaneously, the vaginal discharge and odor returned. Now I am wondering if this is all tied together. Is it possible that i developed an infection after the 2nd surgery that then caused the syncope? Something is going on and I m wondering if it is all related or just coincidental. I cant tell if this hotflash feeling is fever or the aura that precedes a seizure. And could fever mean the vaginal infection spread to my bloodstream which ultimately caused the seizure.

Given your complaints, I do not think your child is at increased risk of getting epilepsy. If it has been 9 years since you stopped the medication, it should not be causing the weakness in bones. that could be due to a deficiency in Vitamin D and calcium.

Doctors said it was normal, but could not understand more. When should we expect him to regain consciouness and when should we worry that he went into a coma?","Doctor":"Hi, . The effects of anesthesia take times to wean off completely. The anesthetic drugs gets metabolized and excreted out of the body system - bringing the consciousness back to the patients. The metabolising time varies individually and is proportional to the amount of drugs used, the duration of procedure and presence of other comorbid condition. At an average, during brain surgeries it may last for 6 - 24 hours. Further brain surgery causes brain edema which can cause drowsiness and sleepiness.  In any neurological setup, the level of consciousness is documented using a scale known as Glassgow Coma Scale (GCS). Here the level is monitored between 3 and 15 - 3 being comatose and 15 indicate full consciousness. I expect the medical staff to keep a track of his GCS score periodically. If his GCS score is periodically increasing, then I do not think there is something to worry. Further if he is breathing on himself and not on a ventilator, it is a good indication that all is well. Discuss with his treating doctors / medical staffs about these parameters. You can learn about his condition with these factors. Hope this helps. Best wishes for his recovery!!!"},{"Patient":"sir iam 22 years old and ihave been diagonised by 1. degenerative disc diseasese with disc desiccation at l4 and l5. 2. mild annular tear at l4 and l5 with associated significant postero central disc protusion at l4 and l5 causing compression over thecal sac 3.mild discogenic spinal stenoisis. minimal posterior disc bulge also noted at l5 and/s1 i have consulted spine specialist and neurosurgeon and after medication they couldnot solve my problem and suggested me operation but iam not willing to . please send your advice.","Doctor":"Dear, . Spine surgeries to treat back problems are indicated only when there are evidences of nerve root compression on MRI scans; no other associated conditions are responsible for the symptoms and when conservative line of treatment fails to produce significant relief as to help you lead a normal life. Accordingly, though the MRI scan doesn't report anything very concerning, if all conservative treatments have failed, then surgical options needs to be considered sooner or later. That being said, it is not very clear what treatments have already been tried on you. Theoretically conservative treatments for such problems consists of - Use of analgesic drugs - Physiotherapy - Epidural injection I duly appreciate your efforts in posting this query here; however I have to apologize that without an opportunity to examine and evaluate you, it is difficult to answer your query. I suggest you to take a second opinion from an experienced spine surgeon/neurosurgeon. Wish you good luck!!!

The nuerosurgeon s operated and removed the hemotoma and also fixed a severe skull fracture , put in titanium plates and screws. Son has some blood and a small blood clot on the right side of his brain due to the brain ricochet from his fall, they did not treat that. He was released from the hospital on 9/12. He was released back to school on 9/24; however, he complains of dizziness to the point of feeling like he is going to pass out when reading and complains of a thumping in his head on the left side all leading to severe headaches. No nausea as he was having before with the immediate issues with the head injury. His follow up appointment is not until 10/15 due to some new hospital scheduling system (he was supposed to have a follow up in 2 weeks). At what point should I consider his complaints normal or consider them more serious requiring an emergency visit to the hospital?","Doctor":"hello thanks for choosing healthcare magic As he had a head injury just about a month back i think he could have rested for atleast 4 weeks before putting him to mental stress . He should avoid any kind of stress for a few more weeks and let the brain to recuperate . The  following are the danger signs and look out for them 1) seizures / fits 2) Head ache followed by vomiting 3) Severe unbearable head ache ( which he describes typically as \\"worst head ache he has ever experienced\\") 4) loss of consciousness 5) periods of loss of memory 6) any neurological deficit ( unable to move his limbs / weakness of limbs ) All of these are emergency situations and require immediate treatment"},{"Patient":"Hello Dr, I have been diagnosed with mild to moderate cervical spondilytis at c6/7 right more and possible left as well with mild protusion.

Your best advice?","Doctor":"hi, what do you mean by numbness? Is it your feeling of numbness or there is real loss of sensations like touch, pain etc. If  you have really lost sensations of touch, pain, warmth, then you need complete work up including CT scan or MRI. But if you can feel touch or pain, and it is just your feeling of numbness then you need not to worry. Sometimes mild normal sensations are perceived as exaggerated if we have a fear of some significant illness like lyme disease or multiple sclersois or trigeminal neuralgia in your case. Till you don't have any other symptom you can rest assured. It will resolve spontaneously within few weeks. best of luck"},{"Patient":"My 24 yr. old Daughter began complaining with her head tingling and hurting..

A dark shadow on brain MRI does not convey much. I can only understand that there is some kind of focal (localized) disease process in brain which is responsible for all the symptoms.  This disease process seem to involve the nerves supplying the arms. It could be an infective, inflammatory , degenerative, space occupying lesion. i advice you to see a specialist (neurologist) soon. Tiredness can be due to the same disease process or even due to low hemoglobin.

Your 35 years old sister has difficulty in lifting the right hand, and difficulty in walking.Probably you haven't shown the MRI to the neurosurgeon.

I dont know what mediactions your grandmother is taking. If it is clearly proved to be tuberculoma then anti-tubercular therapy with proper drugs and dosages should be continued along with close monitoring of her symptoms, physical well being and blood parameters especially liver function testing. For that i will suggest you to consult a pulmonologist for better opinion. Again it is better to also fix an appointment to a neurologist to exclude other neurological causes of such symptoms like cerebellar disorders. An MRI brain should be done if not done yet. If the symptoms are persistent irrespective of adequate treatment then surgical excision of tuberculoma should be considered. Our approach should be step by step.

Recently I have started have severe abdominal cramping, some vomiting when the pain is at it s peak, some diarreah and constipation. This is the second time this has occurred in the last 4 months. My boyfriend has been diagnosed within the past year with severe ulcerative colitis. I have tried some of his meds, but nothing really works except the sterroids. They provide me with a great deal of relief from the pain ( i do not think I could handle it without them), but my condition is not improving and it has been two full weeks, with 9 days on prednisone. 1-3 tablets per day depending on the pain I am experiencing. During my Pet Scan for the cancer my doctor said that he saw evidence of diverticulae. Could this be Diverticulitis instead of Colitis? Would the prednisone help if it were Diverticulitis. p.s. I have seen a doc in the box but have not scheduled with a gastro specialist as they will say I need a colonoscopy which I cannot afford with my lousey insurance policy. I have also recently been experiencing chills and pretty significant weight loss. I am down to 102 lbs and can t really afford to lose anymore. My boyfiend with the colitis has been on several medications for a year and nothing has helped. He doesn t not really experience any pain he only has a feeling of pressure and must go up to 10 or more times a day.

However, there may be bony problems without neurological involvement which can present like this. You need to first be seen by an orthopedician and subsequently by neurologist if required.

Not long after she did this she started having dizzyness when she moved her head to the left side. We tried some eply maneuver exercises at home and she did have episodes of dizzyness when we did a few of the positions. I am curious if the dizzyness is vertigo , if its related to the lowered dose of prednisone, or if it is something complely unrelated. Also while doing the exercises noticed a swollen lymph node on one side of her neck","Doctor":"Hello, If there was a difference in the giddiness in different positions of head during Apley's maneuvre then it is likely to be vertigo. However physician doing the maneuvre can best judge it. Lowering dose of prednisolone usually does not cause dizziness, if the dose reduction is slow. Apart from that electrolyte disturbances in blood as result of prednisone can sometimes cause dizziness. She needs to be evalauted by a physician for making a conclusion.

She had it for the first time and we don;t have any such family history. We met a doc on the same day and he prescribed Eposilin, Ecospirin but her hands have started shaking from the day her medication started. Any idea abt this? She also feels dizziness daily.","Doctor":"Hi, Seizures to your mother may be due to  small CVA means cerebral Ischemia, it is very important to know that is she having high Blood pressure and any other risk factor. Any CT Scan or EEG report of the patient is abnormal. If it is small stroke and seizure Phenytoin is a anticonvulsant will control it but if she is feeling dizziness and there is problem in walking may ? her dose is high or her seizures are not controlled with this dose? You can contact treating doctor and get a serum Phenytoin level  to adjust the dose of the drug. Ecosprin is a antiplatelet  agent and keeps blood flow in brain normal. Good luck to your mother.

His left had became stiff yesterday...the doctors say it can be a cancer or infection and more tests need to be done for the same..as a last effort basis they need a surgery to be done on the brian.. is that advisible based on his condition ? Thanks prasad","Doctor":"Thank you for contacting Healthcare magic. Your father had headache and seizures (twisting of left hand). This was because of the lesion (problem) identified on the MRI and CT scan on the right side (right side of brain controls the left hand). The possible causes of ring lesion in brain include infections (such as tubercolosis-TB, tapeworm infection- neurocysticercosis) and tumors (cancer, etc). Proper treatment depends on identifying the exact cause. This can be done by a small surgery (biopsy of the lesion). In surgery, doctors would remove the ring lesion (in part or total) and send it to pathology lab. The lab will get back with the report in a few days. In addition, anti-epileptic drugs (such as levetiracetam or oxcarbazapine, etc) should be used to prevent further fits (seizures).

Instead of the lightheaded feeling I used to get (while the fainting spells were happening), I had a heavy and numb feeling in my head and I was once again confused for a few seconds. The numbness started in the left side of my head and moved to my whole head and face. Does anyone know what this could be? The numbness and fainting feeling scares me but the confusion and fogginess scares me even more. (I don t want it to happen when I m driving or anything.) Please give me any info you can! More info: -I m morbidly obese and working on losing weight. (lost 25lbs so far.) -I just got off of my period 1 day ago. (It was a pretty painful one.) -I m borderline anemic. (says the doctor.) -I ve been having panic/ anxiety attacks almost daily lately. (use to be very rare for me.) -I haven t been on any medication lately. (just Advil for menstrual cramping.) -I have sinusitis right now. -I was diagnosed with migraines as a pre-teen. (I am now 20) -Within the last few years I ve been experiencing ice pick headaches more and more frequently. P.S.- I live in the Houston, Tx area. Mosquito s and the threat of West Nile virus is very real. Please ask me if you need any more info.

Sudden rupture of a blood vessel in the brain due to raise in BP. 2. Blood clots blocking the vessel and thus the blood supply to the brain. The treatment modality depends upon the nature of the problem and physiotherapy helps in regaining the strength of the muscles. Avoid foods with high calorie; encourage to eat vegetables, oats, white meat (fish), etc which are good to heart. Neurologist and a dietitian can help you in this regard. Regards Dr. Naveen Kumar N.

My father is diagnosed pott’s spine , Details about this disease and treatment is as follows. Patients History. Name: Sri GopalRao Deshpande. Age 83 years, Male, Resident of Sedam, Gulbarga. BP- Normal, Sugar-Normal, Height- 5’6” My father was operated for Bulbo membraneus stricture c~ cystitis on 20-12-2011 at Raghoji Kidney hospital and research centre at Solapur Maharashtra. This is a well known famous hospital (ISO certified). The doctor’s name is Dr Vijay Raghoji M.S. M.Ch (Uro) DNB (uro). Condition on discharge that is four days after surgery was good. We went home with a cathedra inserted. After 3-4 days, the urine was passing by the side of the cathedra as the cathedra was blocked. On 9th day after operation it was removed. Patient started with little fever and severe backache and become bedridden. At that time our area was under coldwave condition, we couldnot differentiate the problem as this was because of cold, operation at this age or infection. Anyways we went to the hospital on 27-01-2012. At the time of operation, his Hb was 13, but then dropped to 7.7. He then diagnosed for haematuria after culture studies of urine was done. Treatment of antibiotics through intravenous was done blood transfusion was given(AB+) and patient was in hospital for full nine days. His fever was subsided but backache was severe and could not sit. He was given all kidneysafe painkillers but still no relief from the backpain . He was discharged and the next follow up was on 23-2-2012. We put him on waterbed as the chances of getting bedsores was high. On the follow-up of 23-2-2012 he was again admitted, doctors sent him to MRI test (report attached).Prescription was given from a visiting doctor Dr. Mudukanna M.D.(General Medicine). AKT-4 Ultracet Pentab-40 Nervigin P Bevon plus Threptin protein biscuits Smuth (for constipation) By this time my father was very weak weighing only 38 kgs. With the start of AKT-4, he started vomiting, uneasiness was there, coundnot cope up with this. I contacted Dr. S.H. Katti (Former joint director,Health), he is a T.B. specialist and close friend of my father in law Prof Vasant Kushtagi (Elder brother of Dr Pralhad Kushtagi). Dr. Katti has given the treatment for cox From 27-2-2012 to 10-3-2012 AKT4 (Thirteen days) (Solapur) Dr Katti’s treatment From 11-3-2012 to 27-5-2012 Forecox 150 and Omnacortil-5, Both twice a day Tapering dose was started on 28-5-2012 with Monto-3 and Omnacortil-5 Once a day Tablet Omnacortil was discontinued after 15 days of tapering. All the other general health medicines were properly maintained along with Monto – 3. In the month of March, my father was very weak, but recovered and was stable. Pain was there but undercontrol. In April, He used to sit upto half an hour with the help of brace on his waste. He could stand and walk 4-5 steps with the help of walker. Beginning of the new Problem. My father was alright and there was no fresh complaints. Just eight days after starting of tab Monto-3, he started suffering from intense pain in lumber area and pain was spread to buttocks also. Calf muscle of right leg was paining a little. Even small leg movements were painful and difficult. I consulted Dr. Katti. He sought an orthopedic opinion on this and referred to Dr. Ramakant Kulkarni MS (ortho). He examined my father and found that there was no neural deficit. After studying MRI , he expressed doubt of pyogenic abscess in the vertebral body of L5-S1 (Just one doubt).He advised us to put the patient on Amakacin 0.5gm and magnis 1 gm for 10 days intravenous, also referred this to neurosurgeon Dr.Shashank Ramdurg, M.Ch Neurosurgery presently working in Basaveshwar hospital Gulbarga. Dr Shashank carefully examined MRI reports but said this must be TB only. He immediately contacted Dr. Chetan Durgi MD Radiologist for opinion. Radiologist said that in Indian conditions this is 99% TB only.Monto-3 was continued. After 3-4 days of intravenous injection of amakacin and magnis, evening rise of temperature was not there, But on 9th day it relapsed. On communication with doctors , they said this I.V. can be continued for 14 days. Even after completion of 14 days, there was no respite from the problem. We family members decided to take the patient to Ashwini multi superspeciality hospital in Solapur. The nephrologist who treated haematuria Dr. Anand Malu was present and referred this to DR Sachin Baldawa neurosurgeon and Dr Pradeep Singhal MD (Gen Med). They retained the patient for four days from 31-7-12 to 4-8-12. Injections Eldcef and pantocid were given twice a day through i.v. A Repeat MRI was done (Second report attached). Actually infection was increased and abscess in the L5-S1 was slightly increased. There were lengthy discussions among doctors. Discussion with Neurosurgeon: Even after putting the patient on antituberculosis drugs for five months, patient did not responded much. This is the fit case for surgery and grafting of L5- S1. But the patient age is above 80 and the risk ratio is very high as the operation is a real major one. Only conservative therapy can be continued. Discussion with physician: The dosage given for TB i.e; forecox 150 was too less for the patient. The sense of well being was due to omnacortil. TB is curable. In his long experience, he has seen patients like this and adjusted the dosage of medicines. Again AKT-4 regime was started along with L-Cin 750, Ultracet- semi for pain, Grenill for fever and tab ketadol if there is intense pain. I was not satisfied and requested doctors to drain the abscess by C.T. guided aspiration as this is feasible for the patient. In C.T. scan room radiologist Dr Iyer was present for this procedure. He took some C.T cuts on his monitor, analyzed and told me that the abscess is on the other side bone and is hardly one ml(1 ml).There is a dirty tissue around it, It is not possible for the needle to reach from the back. Only two bones of the vertebra are involved, there is no need to drain the abscess as it will heal once the infection subsides. After this they discharged the patient. Next follow-up is on 4th September. This is all the story. At present my father is in Sedam. There is no fever now. He is taking all the medicines regularly. While getting up he feels pain and can sit for only 4-5 minutes. Quality of life is affected. Morale is low. I have few questions. 1. When my father will come out from the burden of this spine TB infection? 2. Whether the path followed by the doctors is correct? 3. What improvements in medicines can be made for fast recovery? 4.

However sometimes abnormal postures while sitting at desk pose excessive strain on the vertebrae which can and should be avoided. The tear takes some time to heal and you can go back to work. once it has torn there remains a possibility of it recurring irrespective of the job that you do. Learn some physiotherapy, avoid unhealthy postures and everything should be fine.

You should feel happy that your pain is of the type which is getting relieved with pain killers.

When a small disc bulge is present it first presses on the subarachnoid space and if it increases further, there is a possibility that it will compress the cord.

Surgery is required in patients where medical treatment has failed or if there is severe leg pain, or as decided on the basis of clinical examination.

The physician will rule out many conditions which cause weight loss in a person who is not trying weight management intentionally. Common conditions being diabetes, hyperthyrodism, HIV infection leading to AIDS, TB, hypocortisolism, chronic diarrhea which deprives the body of nutrition from the eaten food etc. Certainly your family history of TBM will help them take decision by having look at you whether you also need to be tested for any kind of TB as it is also one of the causes for weight loss. He/she will also see if the discharge is treated appropriately or not. So see the doctor and ask what all investigations are necessary.

I had a liver enzyme test on June 14th which indicated: ALP 179 ALT 72 AST 68 then I had another test on August 21st which indicated: ALP 174 ALT 55 AST 56 Apparently my liver enzymes have been high since last year. I have Multiple Sclerosis and have been injecting with copaxone for 15 years. Since copaxone is a man made drug I am under the impression that would not elevate liver enzymes. My MS Neuro does not think my other meds are causing any problems. Two family members (on my mother s side) died from liver cancer . My Aunt was 60 and my Grandfather was 80. This is my question: should I pursue additional testing. Symptoms: dark circles under eyes, rough brown bumby rash on upper legs, veins popping out of my hands, feeling sick to stomach during and after meals, bloated belly and a feeling of something is larger on the right upper chest area. My MS Neuro ordered a ultrasound: Impression: 1) No evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis , 2) there was not pain focal to the gallbladder however pain was noted in the right ribs during exam, 3) technicially difficult exam secondary to bowel gas. A probable hepatic hemangloma and cyst noted on prior CT examinations were not visualized. Was never told about #3.","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for contacting Healthcare Magic. You have elevated liver enzymes, which has been confirmed on two occasions, but as per your description, they have been high for over a year. As you corrected suspected, copaxone (glatiramer acetate) used for treating multiple sclerosis (MS), does not lead to elevated liver enzymes. MS per se is a disease of central nervous system (affecting brain, spinal cord and optic nerves); liver is not affected in MS. In view of a positive family history of liver cancer, you possibly should further pusue the abnormality in liver function tests. However, based on Ultrasound exam, your liver is absolutely normal and it is a great relief.

For the past few years my meds have kept me perfect with no seizures at all. Last Dec. though, I had a major funky seizure in which the left side of my body went numb. Just that tingly feeling, not dead weight numb. Dr Peng says it was a seizure, because there was no sign of stroke . Since then, I have had migraines. I had a seizure tonight. I remember being in one place then woke up in another. I had a migraine before it had and a worse one after. I went to the ER. They gave me imitrex for my migraine. My question is: Why is my head going numb? Are they seizures? Or is the side affects of the 100mgs Topamax?","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for contacting Healthcare Magic. You have both migraine and epilepsy. Therefore, topamax (topiramate) is a good choice for you, as it is effective against both the conditions. Topamax is a fairly safe medication and the common side effects are tingling and numbness of feet & legs and weight loss. Numbness of head is usually not due to topamax. It is either due to after effect of seizure (post-ictal state) or a minor seizure.

My left eye vision is blurry compared to my right eye. I am unable to drive around the corner without experiencing this loss of balance. Feels as if I am going to faint, but never do.

I have a very stiff neck and upper back muscles from poor posture and carrying baby around didn t help. I am seeing a chiropractor. Have had carotid and brain MRIs, sinus CT scan, blood panels, Lyme testing, all came back fine. Also took antibiotics in case of an asymptomatic ear infection to no avail. Any thoughts?

(as 25mg is too low a dose and unlikely to provide any meaningful protection against seizures) The risk of seizures is highest in those with multiple lesions in the brain especially those with surrounding inflammation.Even in people with calcified inactive lesions longterm antiepileptic medications is necessary if the patient has recurrent seizures. In some it is possible to taper and stop medications after to 6 to 12 months of radiographic resolution of active infection. There should be no problem in continuing the antiepileptic medication when your sister gets pregnant.If she is apprehensive she can be switched to newer drugs like Levetiracetam which should provide the same quality of protection.She could also discuss with her Neurologist regarding a trial stopping of medication.

You have a classic picture of what is known as temporal lobe epilepsy. In this syndrome, patients usually have fits which involve a certain part of their body. Additionally, they also lose consciousness during these seizures. Treatment of this condition usually involves giving anti epileptic drugs like phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate. If the seizures do not get controlled by this, a surgery called medial temporal lobectomy ( which means the part of the temporal lobe towards the centre is removed) There are a couple of things that you need to keep in mind: a. If you are currently seizure free, then there is nothing to worry about. b. If you are receiving anti-epileptic drugs, please take them regularly under the guidance of your physician. Never discontinue the drug on your own. c. Further, most women with this condition have normal children.

Two days ago whilst drinking a fizzy drink I had chest pains and passed out for a few minutes, my mum said that I had turned blue and stopped breathing.

My mum wasn t happy with me just being at home with no explanation so we went to our local GP who did another ECG, this time the machine showed abnormal repolarization and possible ischaemia. I don t really know what all of this means and I am really worried now! I had looked on the internet the night before GP appt and had really convinced myself that I had suffered from Swallow Syncope as my symptoms exactly matched. Now I don t know what to think so some advice would be greatly appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi, . I see you've already suffer with a heart disease and epilepsy, it would have been better if you had specified what kind of heart disease you suffer with. In the back ground of both the clinical history, the episode is more likely to be a syncope/arrhythmia. If there was any history of tongue bite or urine incontinence, a seizure also needs to be considered. It was good that an ECG was documented during the event. Examining the ECG as a whole can give us clue if you've had a serious problem. In other terms, the machine interpretation of early repolarisation has no much significance as they are subjected to many biases. I would instead suggest you to discuss with your doctor/submit the ECG to an online medical advising site such as yours for better interpretation of the ECG and whether or not those can explain the symptoms you had recently.

You may need to have a laprotomy, and correction.                         First of all he should get treatment for developing the blood, and confidence.

I had an episode for several days where I felt as if I had a constant internal tremor and then had to be admitted to the hospital because of these body jerks in which I had to be totally sedated in order to get it to stop. My 16 year old daughter was admitted a year prior to the hospital for something similar (body jerks, full body muscle spasm ).

A few myoclonic jerks are normal in a person, and they typically occur while we are falling asleep or getting up in the morning. However, in your case, they are definitely abnormal.

Is it possible that you were breathing heavy (like sometimes one does when nauseated) before this things started at that particular time.  heavy breathing reduces carbon dioxide levels in blood and irritate nerves to cause this symptoms.

He managed to drive himself to emergencies where he was kept over night and monitored. He had various blood tests done today which came back clean then was referred to a neurologist who did a thourough physical examination on his arms, muscles etc and suggested the possibility of a herniated disc or pressure coming from a rib located between the shoulder and hand.

In 2001 i had an optic neuritis with no lesions on the brain. The doctor then said he couldnt diagnose me with ms because their were no lesions on the brain but to watch for symptoms because I could develope ms. In 2005 my vision kept blurring in and out.. eye doctor said it wasnt from because my script changed. In 2010 i started feeling light headed and the blurry vision returned. I had abdominal pain starting in 2011 , muscles in legs started to become stiff along with the light headed and vision problems. So I went to the gi who said it could be MS but because celiacs ran in my family he tested for that. That came back positive so I went on a strict gluten free diet hoping I would feel better. The doc also did a transient bowel test which showed my nerves in the bowel werent working. Sign of ms? In may of 2012 i came down with vertigo numbness in my hand and leg on the left side. I had an mri of the brain which showed 6 lesions 3 on each side of the brain. They were consistent with the mcdonald theory but not ms specific in the way they were shaped. So I had a spinal tap I only had 1 oband... My ssep came back abnormal which showed slowing in the thoracic spine . Mri was negative in that area... Blood work pretty much ruled out everything else. Dont I have enough to show that it is ms? I had alot of cis episodes... Thanks for reading.... Lisa","Doctor":"Hi Lisa, Thank you for writing to us. Based on the description of your symptoms and clinical course, the most likely diagnosis is multiple sclerosis. I agree in 2001, it was not possible to classify you as MS. Also, if one only has recurrent optic neuritis without involvement of brain and spinal cord, it can not be called as MS (there is an entity called as recurrent optic neuritis). Also, if one has spinal cord involvement and optic neuitis (with normal brain), it could be NMO (neuromyelitis optica).

I have to hold on to something for support to walk or crawl when I first get up. If not, I have to physically pick my leg up and move it while supporting myself on whatever is near. This last about 3-5 minutes, but making me afraid of falling. Don t want to have to Crawl.","Doctor":"Numbness in the legs and feet could be because of a peripheral nerve problem (nerves of feet). Short-duration numbness after sitting is common and is not worrisome. However, if numbness persists for longer duration or if it occurs without any pressure on the affected area, a nerve disease should be excluded. You should see a neurologist, who might perform a nerve conduction studies  (NCV) test. In addition,he may also check blood tests for diabetes, vitamin B12 deficiency and thyroid.

Do you have any problems with hearing or any ringing sound in ears? if so you are likely to be suffering from Meniere's disease. you need to get evaluated by ENT surgeon for ruling out any external ear problems. Following that some tests like audiometry etc are required. Sometimes migraine may present with such symptoms without any headache. After ENT evaluation you need to consult a neurologist.

His condition has deteriorated in the last month and now he can t be left by himself. He has had an mri on his brain and tomorrow will undergo a spinal tap. His neurologist has ruled out MS. What could it be? What should we be asking his neurologist?","Doctor":"Hello mrs.espo13.  Welcome to healthcaremagic.com.  A month is a very short time for your brother to develop these symptoms.  An MRI should have shown a tumor or another cause like MS.  Your brother's symptoms are all most likely related.  There is a disease called hydrocephalus.  Hydrocephalus is defined as \\"water on the brain\\" and is more common in children than adults.  However hydrocephalus is also found in adults and may occur insidiously (unknown cause) or after a brain injury. Hydrocephalus is characterized, in adults, with rapid onset (usually months), and has the symptoms of poor vision, loss of balance, loss of coordination, mental disturbance (loss of focus), and incontinence.  Your brother has a lot of the symptoms of hydrocephalus.  A spinal tap is the next step in diagnosing and treating hydrocephalus. If your brother's symptoms improve or resolve after the spinal tap, it would be advisable for you and your brother's neurologist to discuss if your brother is a candidate for a V-P shunt.  A V-P shunt is placed in the brain and into the abdominal cavity to drain the excess cerebral spinal fluid from his brain into his abdomen, where the fluid is reabsorbed. I hope that this information helps and good luck to you and your brother. Be well, Dr. Kimberly"},{"Patient":"I have had recent back surgery! 7 weeks ago to b exact! Two levels of lumbar discectomy!

Thanks","Doctor":"Hello, The fact that pain in the right side has improved after surgery confirms that initial diagnosis was correct. The new problem that you are having may be either complication of surgery - for e.g. infection at the surgical site causing involvement of left side nerves. Other possibility is that prolonged positioning during surgery can cause problems like bursitis. In your case repeat imaging of the surgical site may give a clue to the cause.

The indentation on thecal sac can later progress and cause compression over the nerves in the back which will cause pain and other problems. Many joints in the body which are mobile are prone to wear and tear. This process is only partially reversible as one ages and so the changes accumulate.

The appearance of same structure may vary greatly in different sequences (like white vs black). So it may be difficult to comment on the MRI from the description you have given.

Apart from the external bruises that you have, there is possibility that spine and/brain may have suffered minor injuries (because you have dizziness, nausea and headache).

If these degenerative changes progress then problems like, neck pain, restriction of neck movements, arm pain, arm weakness etc can occur.

Inner ear assists our body in keeping balance and is in close proximity to our hearing apparatus.Your symptoms are suggestive of Meniere's disease. Tests of hearing also are part of the work up.

As you yourself have rightly pointed out, you need to consult a doctor who can listen to you for all that you have to say. You have small small problems in many spheres of life which need to be tackled one by one under supervision of a psychologist. For some of the problems few tests may have to be done like for example thyroid function testing. You probably need to look life in a whole new perspective and in a different way. Do consult a psychologist. Good luck."},{"Patient":"I am a 66 yr old female and I have been having tingling and pins and needles down my left arm intermittently for the last 8 months. I have been to a chiropracter and an osteopath, have had neck and back x-rays (which just showed wear and tear), and been to a spinal specialist mainly to get an MRI scan which he did not think I needed. ( I also had sciatica last year which I still get in my left leg at night.) I can get rid of the tingling in my left arm by turning my head to the right or raising my left arm above my head. My GP has prescribed Amitriptyline to help me sleep and I have also had anti inflammatory tablets. Any suggestions or advice or exercises I can do to help would be greatly appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi. at your age it is common to have changes of wear and tear on X-rays. Some times these changes of aging bone can cause compression of the nerves which pass between neck vertebral bones. MRI scan may definitely help in pin pointing the location of compression. Neck collars to restrict movements at the neck and provide support may be useful. Use of hard bed with soft thin pillow may be helpful. Physical therapist can teach you some neck exercises.

Your mother unfortunately has multiple problems and she needs treatment individually for each problem. A single specialist may not be able to manage all her problems. From your description it is not clear whether all the pain is because of osteoporosis or there are additional problems like arthritis. For osteoporosis medications which promote bone deposition and inhibit bone loss are available. It is heartening to know that your mother has such strong will power and she is managing all work. National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) is a good centre in public sector for neuroscience related problems. Good luck."},{"Patient":"Is it possible to vomit your own feces? I know this sounds crazy. I have been dealing with extreme upper abdominal pain for weeks, and am scheduled for an upper GI in a few weeks. But this is getting worse. The vomit now doesn t look normal. It is not with fluids, nor with chunks. It comes out in one solid line.","Doctor":"Hi, thank you writing to the forum. With this presentation, I think you intestinal obstruction. Depending on the level of obstruction, it is possible to vomit something that looks like feces as a result of back flow. You need to rush to emergency unit for proper assessment.I wish you good health"},{"Patient":"hi doctor, I am suffering from headache in the whole brain from last three months. CT scan was done and a calcified granuloma was detected in the frontal lobe . X- ray of cervical spine suggested straightening of curvature. but my neurologist doubted that such an headache cannot be because of granuloma, and this granuloma is not dangerous for me. i am continuously taking amixide H 2.5, Migserm 500mg 1BD and Duloxee 40mg. I am not getting any relief from this headache. my query is that whether granuloma in the frontal lobe can cause headache and what is the relation of my headache with straightening of curvature ? am i taking correct medicines , please clarify ?","Doctor":"Dear friend, welcome to HCM, calcified granuloma in the brain can not give such headache.(how big is it? a small one is insignificant) cervical spine straightening and headache has many causes. your doctor is the best person to judge. you are on anti depressants. it is ok if your doc feels you are depressed/ stressed and have headache. but plain paracetamol may help if it is simple headache. do you have fever? I think a good neurologist is needed to treat you. sometimes we need to do a lumbar puncture to look for causes there. sitting here , I can safely tell you this much. either see a good neurologist/ post great details about the headache ans xray spine details to enable some advice. take care and pl. keep me posted on the progress."},{"Patient":"Hello, When I was around 12, I was being a big baby and crying about something (don t remember what) when I felt something shoot up the right side up my neck into the right side of my head. It felt like the right side of my head suddenly got stuck with pens and needles. I didn t experience any other symptoms. I had no numbness anywhere in my body. I didn t tell anybody about it. Over the course of about the next 5 years, similar occurrences happened maybe about 5 or 6 times. These were never as profound as the initial incident, and only occurred during certain burst n movement. It happened once when I dunked a basketball, once when I turned my neck suddenly marching with the band in a parade, and once when I was about to run. I m 27 now, and NONE of this has happened within the last 9 or 10 years. I have to be unhealthier now. I ve been a drinker (weekends mostly) and cigarette smoker since I first went off to college at 18. I hadn t even attempted to drink or smoke once before 18. I was a little underweight in grade school. I m a litter overweight now. I m just confused how these stroke-like incidents occurred when I was healthier, but nothing has occurred in the last 10 years. Did these sounds like strokes? Or maybe something else could have caused it? Despite 10 years, should I still go tell a doctor and get checked out? For some reason out of the blue, this popped up in my mind a couple days ago and I m worried it will randomly happen again.","Doctor":"Dear friend, welcome to HCM, none of these symptoms point to any stroke. you need not worry much. stroke will come as local weakness, occassionally persistent altered sansation in well defined territories. take care and pl. keep me posted on the progress."},{"Patient":"I took Topamax several years ago to help me with migraines. I think I was on around 300 mg, but I can t remember exactly. I had to go off it because my memory was so poor. I was like a moderate alzheimer s patient. it has been several years since I have been off the drug, actually all drugs finally. is there anything I can do to improve my memory? I am a 41 year old female. my memory did improve some since I have been off the med, but it is still significan t poor for my age. it is very noticiable to those around me how poor my memory is.","Doctor":"Hi welcome to HCMForum. You may be right that you have developed alzimers like memory loss. when you have stopped the drugs you have recovered to a great extent. As with everybody who have memory loss and recovered you must be having memory loss of psychological origin. I advise you to consult a physician for diagnosis and treatment. Besides i advise you to follow some other ways of treatment. follow diversion procedures as yoga meditation reading hearing music if interested gardening to divert from the feeling that you have memory loss.. I advise you some diet recomendations as  take more of green leafy vegetables pulses sprouts fruits and juices which will increase the general health and mental health. wishing for a quick recovery. thanks for calling."},{"Patient":"Dr. I m from srilanka. my wife have a brain cancer . we think that. now she admit in srilanka Ayurveda hospital at matara. that hospital doctors gave to her that tumor melting dosage. but she had a headache , nose blooding , mouth blooding. is that serious problem doctor ? her hair also outing. what is that brain tumor stage ? actually we want to know is it brain cancer ? that s the way we admit her to hospital.
