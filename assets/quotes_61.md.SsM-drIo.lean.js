The ants keep walking indefinitely.Assuming that the total number of collisions is finite, determine the largest possible number of collisions in terms of n.","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We have ( n ) ants walking along a line at constant nonzero speeds. They can walk in either direction and change direction upon collision. We need to determine the maximum number of collisions that can occur, assuming the total number of collisions is finite.2. Key Insight:   The order of the ants along the line does not change. Denote by ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_n ) the respective speeds of ants ( 1, 2, ldots, n ) in this order. If ( v_{i-1} < v_i > v_{i+1} ) for some ( i in {2, ldots, n-1} ), then ant ( i ) can catch up with ants ( i-1 ) or ( i+1 ) irrespective of their directions of motion, leading to an infinite number of collisions. Hence, for the number of collisions to be finite, the speeds must be ordered such that:   - ( v_1 geq v_2 geq cdots geq v_n ) (all ants are moving in the same direction with non-increasing speeds), or   - ( v_1 geq cdots geq v_{k-1} > v_k leq cdots leq v_n ) for some ( k in {2, ldots, n-1} ).3. Claim:   If ( v_1 geq cdots geq v_m ), then ants ( m-1 ) and ( m ) collide at most ( m-1 ) times.4. Proof of the Claim:   - Base Case: For ( m = 1 ), the statement is trivial as there are no collisions.   - Inductive Step: Assume the statement holds for ( m-1 ). Consider ( m ) ants with ( v_1 geq cdots geq v_m ). Ants ( m-1 ) and ( m ) can only collide if ( v_{m-1} geq v_m ). Between successive collisions with ant ( m ), ant ( m-1 ) must reverse direction by colliding with ant ( m-2 ). By the inductive hypothesis, ants ( m-1 ) and ( m-2 ) collide at most ( m-2 ) times. Therefore, ants ( m ) and ( m-1 ) collide at most ( (m-2) + 1 = m-1 ) times. (blacksquare)5. Case Analysis:   - Case (i): If ( v_1 geq cdots geq v_n ), the total number of collisions is at most:     [     0 + 1 + 2 + cdots + (n-1) = frac{n(n-1)}{2}     ]   - Case (ii): If ( v_1 geq cdots geq v_{k-1} > v_k leq cdots leq v_n ), applying the claim to ants ( 1, 2, ldots, k ) and also to ants ( n, n-1, ldots, k ) by switching their order, the number of collisions is at most:     [     frac{k(k-1)}{2} + frac{(n-k+1)(n-k)}{2} = frac{n(n-1)}{2} - (k-1)(n-k)     ]     which is less than ( frac{n(n-1)}{2} ).6. Constructing an Example:   Place ants at ( x = 1, 2, ldots, n ) with positive initial velocities and speeds ( v_1 = cdots = v_{n-1} = 1 ) and ( v_n = varepsilon ) for some small ( varepsilon ). For ( varepsilon = 0 ), collisions occur such that ants ( m ) and ( m+1 ) collide exactly ( m ) times for ( m = 1, 2, ldots, n-1 ). This yields:   [   1 + 2 + cdots + (n-1) = frac{n(n-1)}{2}   ]   collisions in total.

Initial Consideration:   - We start by considering the set ( S ) and the condition that for any partition of ( S ) into two subsets ( A ) and ( B ), one of these subsets must contain ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) such that ( ab = c ).2. Bounding for ( m leq 242 ):   - If ( m leq 242 ), we can construct a partition that avoids the condition ( ab = c ). Consider the partition:     [     A = {3, 4, ldots, 8, 81, 82, ldots, m}     ]     [     B = {9, 10, ldots, 80}     ]   - In this partition, ( A ) contains numbers that are either too small or too large to form a product that lies within ( S ), and ( B ) contains numbers that are not products of any two numbers in ( A ).3. Constructing a Bad Set for ( m = 243 ):   - We now attempt to construct a partition for ( m = 243 ) and show that it is impossible to avoid the condition ( ab = c ).   - Without loss of generality (WLOG), let ( 3 in A ). Since ( 3^2 = 9 ), we must have ( 9 in B ).   - Since ( 9^2 = 81 ), we must have ( 81 in A ).   - Because ( 3 cdot 27 = 81 ), we must have ( 27 in B ).   - However, ( 3 cdot 81 = 243 ) and ( 9 cdot 27 = 243 ), implying that ( 243 ) cannot belong to either set ( A ) or ( B ) without violating the condition ( ab = c ).4. Conclusion:   - Since it is impossible to partition ( S ) for ( m = 243 ) without one of the subsets containing ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) such that ( ab = c ), we conclude that the smallest value of ( m ) is ( boxed{243} )."},{"problem":"Given sets A={x|1leqslant x lt 5}, B={x|-a lt xleqslant a+3}.

What two integers formed in this way have the greatest product? Prove your answer.","solution":"The answer is 9642 times 87531.Place value is an important feature of this problem, but it's awkward to write about since the leading digits matter most, yet we do not know how many digits each number will have. As a workaround, let us prepend \\"0.\\" to the two integers we are forming, making them into decimals. For example, 7419 and 82635 would become 0.7419 and 0.82635 . Regardless of how many digits our two integers have, the effect is to divide their product by 10^{9}. Thus, whichever decimals formed in this way have the largest product will correspond to the integers that have the largest product in the original formulation of the problem. The benefit of this transformation is that the leading digits now have a definite place value of tenths, etc.It is clear that the digits of each decimal should be in descending order (otherwise we can increase that number by rearranging them). Less obviously, a larger digit should never be assigned a lower place value in one decimal than the place value assigned to a smaller digit in the other decimal. For example, we should not form the decimals 0.98 ldots and 0.7 ldots, where the larger 8 is assigned a place value of hundredths while the smaller 7 is assigned a place value of tenths. Proof: Let our two decimals be x and y, let digit d have place value 10^{-a} in decimal x, and let digit e have place value 10^{-b} in decimal y, where d>e and a>b. Then swapping these two digits increases the product of the two decimals by (d-e)left(10^{-b} y-10^{-a} xright)=(d-e)left(10^{-a}right)left(10^{a-b} y-xright). Since 0.1 leq x, y10^{-1} x, and therefore the increase is positive.As a result of the foregoing, we see that the tenths digits of our two decimals must be 9 and 8 (in some order), the hundredths digits must be 7 and 6 (in some order), the thousandths must be 5 and 4 , the ten-thousandths 3 and 2 , and the hundredthousandths 1 (and 0).

We place these from left to right.There are 3 possible digits that could go in the leftmost empty position.After this digit is placed, there are 2 possible digits that could go in the next empty position. Finally, the remaining digit is placed in the remaining empty position.This process works for each of the pairs of positions for the two 1 s.Therefore, there are 6 times 3 times 2=36 such five-digit integers ( 6 pairs of positions for the 1 s, 3 choices for the first empty position, and 2 choices for the second empty position).## Solution 2Since there are 5 digits to arrange and 2 of them are the same, there are frac{5 !}{2 !}=frac{120}{2}=60 arrangements:To see this, replace one of the 1 s with and X so that the \\"digits\\" were 1,2,3,4, X.

For example, 43 X 21 and 4312 X become the same arrangement.Therefore, we need to divide the total 120 by 2 !=2 since each arrangement is double-counted.In some of these arrangements, the 1s will be next to each other and in some they will not be.

Since angle C=90^{circ}, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with angle C as the right angle.2. The sine of an angle in a right-angled triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Therefore, sin A = frac{BC}{AB} = frac{4}{5}.3.

To find the length of side AC, we use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (AB) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (AC and BC). Therefore, we have:   [AC = sqrt{AB^2 - BC^2} = sqrt{25^2 - 20^2} = 15.]5.

Analyze the angles and relationships:   - Let (angle BAC = theta).   - Since (angle AFB = 90^circ) and (E) is the midpoint of (AB), (AE = BE = FE).   - This implies (triangle AEF) and (triangle BEF) are isosceles right triangles.6.

Use the Given Length of |MN|=4: Since |MN|=4, and this is a chord of the circle that is perpendicular to the radius at its midpoint, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the radius of the circle and the distance from the center to the asymptote. Thus, sqrt{r^2 - left(frac{|MN|}{2}right)^2} = d, which simplifies to sqrt{(2sqrt{2})^2 - 2^2} = 2.5.

Find the Eccentricity: The eccentricity e of the hyperbola is defined as e = frac{c}{a}, where c = sqrt{a^2+b^2}. Given a = sqrt{5} and b^2 = 4, we find c = sqrt{5+4} = 3.

Identifying the Focus:     The equation of the ellipse is given by frac{x^2}{4}+frac{y^2}{3}=1. From this, we can deduce the right focus F to be at (1,0), since the semi-major axis a^2=4 implies a=2.

Substitute (a, b, d) into the first equation:   [   (k - n) + (k + n) + c + kn = 100   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   2k + c + kn = 100   ]   Since (c = frac{k}{n}), substitute (c) into the equation:   [   2k + frac{k}{n} + kn = 100   ]   Multiply through by (n) to clear the fraction:   [   2kn + k + k n^2 = 100n   ]   Factor out (k):   [   k(2n + 1 + n^2) = 100n   ]   Solving for (k):   [   k = frac{100n}{2n + 1 + n^2}   ]4. Determine possible values of (n):   Since (k) must be an integer, (2n + 1 + n^2) must divide (100n). We need to find (n) such that this condition holds.   Let's test possible values of (n) that make (2n + 1 + n^2) a divisor of (100n):   - For (n = 1):     [     2(1) + 1 + 1^2 = 4 quad text{and} quad k = frac{100 cdot 1}{4} = 25     ]     Thus, (a = 24), (b = 26), (c = 25), (d = 25), (n = 1).   - For (n = 4):     [     2(4) + 1 + 4^2 = 25 quad text{and} quad k = frac{100 cdot 4}{25} = 16     ]     Thus, (a = 12), (b = 20), (c = 4), (d = 64), (n = 4).   - For (n = 9):     [     2(9) + 1 + 9^2 = 100 quad text{and} quad k = frac{100 cdot 9}{100} = 9     ]     Thus, (a = 0), (b = 18), (c = 1), (d = 81), (n = 9).

What is the maximum number of sides a coin can have as a projection of a convex polyhedron with n faces?","solution":"8.6. Answer: 2 n-4. First, let's prove that the projection of a convex polyhedron with n faces can have 2 n-4 sides. Cut off the edge C D of a regular tetrahedron A B C D with a prismatic surface, the lateral edges of which are parallel to C D (Fig. 57). The projection of the resulting polyhedron with n faces onto a plane parallel to the lines A B and C D has 2 n-4 sides.Now, let's prove that the projection M of a convex polyhedron with n faces cannot have more than 2 n-4 sides. The number of sides of the projection onto a plane that is not perpendicular to a face cannot be greater than the number of sides of all other projections. Indeed, in such a projection, each face turns into a side of the polygon; if the projection plane is slightly moved, this side will either remain or split into several sides, while the number of other sides will not change. Therefore, we will consider projections onto planes that are not perpendicular to the faces. In this case, the edges that project into the boundary of the polygon M divide the polyhedron into two parts: \\"upper\\" and \\"lower\\". Let p_{1} and p_{2}, q_{1} and q_{2}, r_{1} and r_{2} be the number of vertices, edges, and faces in the upper and lower parts (vertices and edges of the section are not counted); m be the number of vertices of the polygon M, m_{1} (respectively m_{2}) be the number of vertices of M from which at least one edge of the upper (respectively lower) part extends. Since from each vertex of M at least one edge of the upper or lower part extends, m leqslant m_{1}+m_{2}. Now, let's estimate the number m_{1}. From each vertex of the upper part, at least three edges extend, so the number of ends of the edges of the upper part is at least 3 p_{1} + m_{1}. On the other hand, the number of ends of these edges is 2 q_{1}; therefore, 3 p_{1} + m_{1} leqslant 2 q_{1}. Now, let's prove that p_{1} - q_{1} + r_{1} = 1. The projections of the edges of the upper part divide the polygon M into several polygons. The sum of the angles of these polygons is pi(m-2) + 2 pi p_{1}. On the other hand, it is equal to sum_{i} pi(q_{1 i} - 2), where q_{1 i} is the number of sides of the i-th polygon of the partition; the latter sum is equal to pi(m + 2 q_{1}) - 2 r_{1}. Equating both expressions for the sum of the angles of the polygons, we get the required result. Since q_{1} = p_{1} + r_{1} - 1 and m_{1} + 3 p_{1} leqslant 2 q_{1}, then m_{1} leqslant 2 r_{1} - 2 - p_{1} leqslant 2 r_{1} - 2. Similarly, m_{2} leqslant 2 r_{2} - 2.

Find the minimum value of n.","solution":"First, we prove that ( n geqslant 11 ).Consider a convex heptagon ( A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} A_{4} A_{5} A_{6} A_{7} ) with vertices in ( M ). Connect ( A_{1} A_{5} ). By condition (1), there is at least one point in ( M ) within the convex pentagon ( A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} A_{4} A_{5} ), denoted as ( P_{1} ). Connect ( P_{1} A_{1} ) and ( P_{1} A_{5} ). Then, in the convex pentagon ( A_{1} P_{1} A_{5} A_{6} A_{7} ), there is at least one point in ( M ), denoted as ( P_{2} ), and ( P_{2} ) is different from ( P_{1} ). Connect the line ( P_{1} P_{2} ). Among ( A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{7} ), at least 5 vertices are not on the line ( P_{1} P_{2} ). By the pigeonhole principle, there must be 3 vertices on one side of the line ( P_{1} P_{2} ). These 3 vertices, together with points ( P_{1} ) and ( P_{2} ), form a convex pentagon that contains at least one point in ( M ), denoted as ( P_{3} ).Next, draw the lines ( P_{1} P_{3} ) and ( P_{2} P_{3} ). Let the region ( pi_{3} ) be the half-plane bounded by the line ( P_{1} P_{2} ) and on the opposite side of ( triangle P_{1} P_{2} P_{3} ) (excluding the line ( P_{1} P_{2} )). Similarly, define regions ( pi_{1} ) and ( pi_{2} ). These three regions ( pi_{1}, pi_{2}, pi_{3} ) cover all points on the plane except for ( triangle P_{1} P_{2} P_{3} ). By the pigeonhole principle, among the 7 vertices ( A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{7} ), there must be ( left[frac{7}{3}right] + 1 = 3 ) vertices in the same region (let's say ( pi_{3} )). These 3 points, together with ( P_{1} ) and ( P_{2} ), form a convex pentagon with vertices in ( M ), so its interior must contain at least one point in ( M ), denoted as ( P_{4} ). Therefore, ( n geqslant 11 ).Next, we construct an example to show that ( n = 11 ) is possible. As shown in Figure 1, the convex heptagon ( A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} A_{4} A_{5} A_{6} A_{7} ) is an integer-point heptagon with 4 points inside, so condition (1) is clearly satisfied. This point set ( M ) also satisfies condition (2). The proof is as follows: by contradiction, assume there exists an integer-point convex pentagon whose interior does not contain any integer points. Then, because the area of any integer-point polygon can be expressed as ( frac{n}{2} ) (where ( n in mathbf{N}_{+} )), by the principle of the smallest number, there must be a smallest area integer-point convex pentagon ( A B C D E ) whose interior does not contain any integer points. Considering the parity of the coordinates of the vertices, there are only 4 cases: (odd, even), (even, odd), (odd, odd), (even, even). Thus, among the vertices of the pentagon ( A B C D E ), there must be two vertices with the same parity for both coordinates, so their midpoint ( P ) is still an integer point. Since ( P ) is not inside the convex pentagon ( A B C D E ), ( P ) must be on one of the sides of the pentagon. Without loss of generality, assume ( P ) is on side ( A B ), then ( P ) is the midpoint of ( A B ). Connect ( P E ), then ( P B C D E ) is a smaller area integer-point convex pentagon whose interior does not contain any integer points, which is a contradiction.In conclusion, the minimum value of ( n ) is 11."},{"problem":"## Task B-2.2.How many integers x satisfy the inequality x^{4}-2020 x^{2}+2019<0 ?","solution":"## First Solution.The given inequality can be written in factored form:begin{gathered}left(x^{2}-2019right)left(x^{2}-1right)<0 (x-sqrt{2019})(x+sqrt{2019})(x-1)(x+1)<0 .end{gathered}Using a sign chart or graphically![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_30_d3836afd55956f7fff9cg-06.jpg?height=211&width=962&top_left_y=2279&top_left_x=473)we arrive at the solution of the inequality in the set mathbb{R}x inlangle-sqrt{2019},-1rangle cuplangle 1, sqrt{2019}rangleThe desired numbers arex in mathbb{Z} cap(langle-sqrt{2019},-1rangle cuplangle 1, sqrt{2019}rangle)orx in{-44,-43, ldots,-3,-2,2,3, ldots, 44}1 pointThere are 43 cdot 2=86 such integers."},{"problem":"14.

There are two possibilities: to take two cards with powers of three and one with a power of eleven, or vice versa. Suppose we take two cards with powers of three.

If in each of those unit squares exactly one number is written, such that any square with side 3 is a magic square, then find the number of most different numbers that can be written in that rectangle.","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the maximum number of different numbers that can be written in an (m times n) rectangle such that any (3 times 3) sub-square is a magic square. A magic square is defined such that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and both diagonals are equal.2. Case (m = n = 3):   For a (3 times 3) magic square, it is well-known that there are 9 different numbers that can be used. This is because a (3 times 3) magic square has a unique arrangement of numbers from 1 to 9 that satisfies the magic square properties.3. Case (m > 3) or (n > 3):   For larger rectangles, we need to ensure that every (3 times 3) sub-square is a magic square. Let's assume (m geq 4) and (n geq 4) for generality.4. Assumption and Simplification:   Assume without loss of generality that the number in the top-left corner of the rectangle is 0. This is possible because we can subtract a constant from every unit square without changing the magic square property.5. Setting Up the Equations:   Let the numbers in the first (3 times 3) sub-square be:   [   begin{array}{ccc}   0 & x & y    z & w & t    u & v & s    end{array}   ]   The magic square conditions give us the following equations:   [   begin{aligned}   0 + x + y &= z + w + t = u + v + s,    0 + z + u &= x + w + v = y + t + s,    0 + w + s &= y + w + u.   end{aligned}   ]6. Solving the Equations:   From the equations, we can derive that:   [   begin{aligned}   x + y &= z + w + t - 0,    z + u &= x + w + v - 0,    w + s &= y + w + u - 0.   end{aligned}   ]   By solving these equations, we find that all variables must be equal to maintain the magic square property across the entire rectangle.7. Conclusion for Larger Rectangles:   If (m > 3) or (n > 3), the only way to satisfy the condition that every (3 times 3) sub-square is a magic square is if all numbers in the rectangle are the same. This is because any deviation would violate the magic square property in overlapping (3 times 3) sub-squares.8. Final Answer:   For (m = n = 3), the maximum number of different numbers is 9. For (m > 3) or (n > 3), the maximum number of different numbers is 1.The final answer is ( boxed{ 9 } ) for (m = n = 3) and (1) for (m > 3) or (n > 3)."},{"problem":"10.

The triangle inequality theorem states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.2. Applying the triangle inequality theorem to triangle ( ABC ):   - ( AB + AC > BC )   - ( AB + BC > AC )   - ( AC + BC > AB )3. Substitute the given side lengths ( AB = 20 ) and ( AC = 17 ):   - ( 20 + 17 > n )   - ( 20 + n > 17 )   - ( 17 + n > 20 )4. Simplify each inequality:   - ( 37 > n ) or ( n < 37 )   - ( 20 + n > 17 ) simplifies to ( n > -3 ) (which is always true for positive ( n ))   - ( 17 + n > 20 ) simplifies to ( n > 3 )5. Combining the valid inequalities, we get:   [   3 < n < 37   ]6. Since ( n ) must be an integer, the possible values of ( n ) are the integers between 3 and 37, exclusive. Therefore, ( n ) can take any integer value from 4 to 36.7. To find the number of possible values for ( n ), we count the integers from 4 to 36 inclusive:   [   36 - 4 + 1 = 33   ]The final answer is (boxed{33})."},{"problem":"Given that the real part of the complex number z is 1, and |z|=2, the imaginary part of the complex number z is (　　)A: - sqrt {3}B:  sqrt {3}iC: pm sqrt {3}iD: pm sqrt {3}","solution":"Let the imaginary part of the complex number z be b.

Therefore, if the pair (a, b) occurs, then b must always be paired with a, and a with b.

Let there be exactly x liars in the room (x is a natural number). Note that if two people have the same eye color, then they either both tell the truth or both lie. Therefore, it is impossible for a liar and a knight to have the same eye color. We will divide all people into groups. We will put all the liars in one group, and divide the knights into groups by eye color. Then in each of the groups of knights there are exactly x people, as follows from the statement of any of the knights in this group. If there are n groups of knights, we get the equation (n+1) cdot x=30. Then the number of liars x is a divisor of 30. Moreover, it is impossible for all liars to have the same eye color - otherwise they would be telling the truth. Therefore, x>1.

Initial Example and Upper Bound:   By checking for minimum values, we get that the least tuple is ((1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4)), as (1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 4^2).   Thus, if ( k mid abcdef ) for all ( a, b, c, d, e, f ) satisfying the equation, ( k mid 24 Rightarrow k leq 24 ).2. Claim: ( k = 24 ) is the required solution.   Proof:   - Divisibility by 3:     - If none of the numbers ( a, b, c, d, e, f ) are divisible by 3, then ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2 equiv 5 pmod{3} ), but ( f^2 equiv 1 pmod{3} ). This is a contradiction.     - Therefore, at least one of the numbers ( a, b, c, d, e, f ) must be divisible by 3. Hence, ( 3 mid abcdef ).   - Divisibility by 8:     - Any odd perfect square ( equiv 1 pmod{8} ). An even perfect square can be either ( equiv 0 ) or ( 4 pmod{8} ).     - Case 1: If ( a, b, c, d, e ) are odd, then ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2 equiv 5 pmod{8} Rightarrow f^2 equiv 5 pmod{8} ), which is a contradiction.     - Case 2: If ( a, b, c, d ) are odd, then ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 equiv 4 + e^2 pmod{8} ). Since ( e ) is even, ( e^2 equiv 0 ) or ( 4 pmod{8} ). If ( e^2 equiv 0 pmod{8} Rightarrow 16 mid e^2 ), thus ( 4 mid e ) and ( f ) is even, implying ( 8 mid abcdef ). If ( e^2 equiv 4 pmod{8} Rightarrow f^2 equiv 0 pmod{8} ), thus ( 8 mid f^2 Rightarrow 16 mid f^2 Rightarrow 4 mid f ) and ( e ) is even, implying ( 8 mid abcdef ).     - Case 3: If ( a, b, c ) are odd, then ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 equiv 3 + d^2 + e^2 pmod{8} ). Since ( d ) and ( e ) are even, ( f ) is odd, thus ( f^2 equiv 1 pmod{8} ). Therefore, ( 3 + d^2 + e^2 equiv 1 pmod{8} Rightarrow d^2 + e^2 equiv 6 pmod{8} ). But any even square ( equiv 0 ) or ( 4 pmod{8} Rightarrow d^2 + e^2 equiv 0 ) or ( 4 pmod{8} notequiv 6 ), which is a contradiction.     - Case 4: If (leq 2) numbers on the LHS are odd, then (geq 3) numbers on the LHS are even, implying ( 8 mid abcdef ).   From the above cases, we conclude that ( 8 mid abcdef ).3. Combining Results:   From the divisibility by 3 and 8, we get that ( 24 mid abcdef ).Therefore, our claim is proved.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ 24 } )."},{"problem":"Given points A(1,2) and B(3,5), and vector  overrightarrow{a}=(x,6), if  overrightarrow{a}  is parallel to  overrightarrow{AB} , find the value of the real number x.","solution":"Since we have points A(1,2) and B(3,5), we can find the vector  overrightarrow{AB}  by subtracting the coordinates of point A from those of point B:  overrightarrow{AB} = (3,5) - (1,2) = (2,3).

Analyzing the Scoring Formula:   - The formula (frac{2}{1 + 0.05|A - E|}) indicates that the score decreases as the absolute difference (|A - E|) increases.   - To maximize the score, we need to minimize (|A - E|), which means our estimate ( E ) should be as close as possible to the actual answer ( A ).3. Range of Submissions:   - Since the problem asks for an estimate of the range of submissions, we need to consider the possible values that ( A ) can take.   - Given the constraint that ( E ) must be between ( [0, 1000] ), we infer that ( A ) must also lie within this range.4. Optimal Strategy:   - Without additional information about the distribution of ( A ), a reasonable strategy is to choose the midpoint of the range to minimize the maximum possible error.   - The midpoint of the range ( [0, 1000] ) is:     [     E = frac{0 + 1000}{2} = 500     ]5.

To solve this problem, we first treat A and B as a single unit since they must be adjacent. We now have 4 units to arrange: AB, C, D, and E. These can be arranged in A_4^4 = 4! = 24 ways. However, since C and D cannot be adjacent, we need to subtract the cases where they are together. Treating C and D as a single unit, we have 4 units to arrange: AB, CD, and E. These can be arranged in A_3^3 = 3! = 6 ways. But C and D can swap places within their unit, giving us 2! = 2 ways. So, there are 6 cdot 2 = 12 cases where C and D are adjacent. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the students is 24 - 12 = boxed{12}.2. To distribute the students into three classes, we first consider the case where one class has 3 students and the other two classes have 1 student each.

There are C_5^2 = 10 ways to choose the 2 students for the first class, C_3^2 = 3 ways to choose the 2 students for the second class, and A_2^2 = 2! = 2 ways to arrange the students within each of these classes.

By trying some integer values, we find that x=5 is a root. To find further roots, the equation can be significantly simplified by introducing a new unknown in place of one of the square roots, as a linear expression stands under the roots, and thus x will be a polynomial of the new unknown. It is advisable to introduce a new unknown in place of sqrt{x-4}, and since its value at x=5 is 1, it is convenient to use 1+t:begin{gathered}sqrt{x-4}=1+t, text { i.e., } x=t^{2}+2 t+5, text { where } t geqq-1end{gathered}because the square root is non-negative.

For t geqq 0, f(t)>0, so (4) has no positive roots. However, there is one in the interval (-1,0), because f(-1)=-20end{gathered}because all 6 terms in the square brackets are positive, so f(t) is strictly increasing in the interval.Based on the values f(-1)=-2, f(0)=2 and using linear interpolation, we try the approximation t_{1}=-0.5: f(-0.5)=-0.125, so the root is greater than t_{1}. However, taking t_{2}=-0.4, we get f(-0.4)=0.256>0, so the root is less than t_{2}. Using linear interpolation again based on the last two values, t_{2}=-0.5+0.125 / 0.381 approx-0.467 is suggested as an approximation, and it turns out to be good: f(-0.467)=0.00067, so the root of (4) is t>-0.467.From (2), x>4.284 ldots, because according to the transformation x=(t+1)^{2}+4, x is a monotonically increasing function of t for t>-1.To determine the value of x to the second decimal place, consider the value of f(-0.466 ldots=f(-7 / 15): 2 / 3375>0, so t<-7 / 15, and for t=-7 / 15, x=3856 / 900<4.285.

How many possibilities are there for the sequence formed by taking the first element of each row, starting from the last row, which arise from a good sequence?  ","solution":"To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of the triangle and the properties of the sequence. Let's break down the solution step by step.1. Understanding the Triangle Formation:   - The first row of the triangle is given by the sequence ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n ).   - Each subsequent row is formed by adding adjacent elements of the previous row modulo 2. For example, if the first row is ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n ), the second row will be ( x_1 + x_2, x_2 + x_3, ldots, x_{n-1} + x_n ) (modulo 2).2. Defining a Good Sequence:   - A sequence is called good if it is the same as the sequence formed by taking the last element of each row, starting from the last row.3. Analyzing the Problem:   - We need to find the number of possibilities for the sequence formed by taking the first element of each row, starting from the last row, which arise from a good sequence.4. Symmetry and Rotational Invariance:   - By observing the properties of the triangle, we note that if ( a, b, c ) are in an equilateral triangle of side length 1, with ( c ) below ( a ) and ( b ), then ( c = a + b ) (mod 2). This implies that ( a = b + c ) and ( b = a + c ).   - Rotating the triangle ( 120^circ ) clockwise and performing the same operations starting from the entries of the top row does not change the outcome. This symmetry suggests that the sequence must be symmetric with respect to its midpoint.5. Symmetric Sequences:   - For the sequence to be symmetric, the first half of the sequence must mirror the second half. This means that the sequence can be divided into two parts, and each part determines the other.6. Counting the Possibilities:   - If ( n ) is even, the sequence can be divided into two equal parts of length ( n/2 ). Each part can be any binary sequence of length ( n/2 ), giving ( 2^{n/2} ) possibilities.   - If ( n ) is odd, the sequence can be divided into two parts, one of length ( lceil n/2 rceil ) and the other of length ( lfloor n/2 rfloor ). Since ( lceil n/2 rceil = lfloor n/2 rfloor + 1 ), the number of possibilities is ( 2^{lceil n/2 rceil} ).Therefore, the number of possibilities for the sequence formed by taking the first element of each row, starting from the last row, which arise from a good sequence, is ( 2^{lceil n/2 rceil} ).The final answer is ( boxed{ 2^{lceil n/2 rceil} } )."},{"problem":"Let m and n be two different lines, and alpha and beta be two different planes.

The odd parts of the numbers in ( S ) are ( {1, 3, 5, cdots, 6n-1} ). If two numbers ( a ) and ( b ) have the same odd part and ( a < b ), then ( a mid b ).

From this, we can deduce that:[l = 2r]The total surface area of the cone is given as 3pi, which includes both the base area and the lateral (or slant) surface area. The formula for the surface area of a cone is:[S = pi r^2 + pi rl]Substituting l = 2r into the surface area formula, we get:[3pi = pi r^2 + pi r(2r)]Simplifying this equation:[3pi = pi r^2 + 2pi r^2][3pi = 3pi r^2]Dividing both sides by 3pi, we find:[r^2 = 1]Taking the square root of both sides gives us the radius of the base of the cone:[r = 1]Since the diameter is twice the radius, the diameter of the base of the cone is:[d = 2r = 2 times 1 = 2]Therefore, the correct answer is encapsulated as boxed{A}."},{"problem":"A triangle has exradii r_{a}, r_{b}, and r_{c}, and the radius of its circumcircle is R.

Similar to the second solution, the remainders of the first, second, ..., sixth powers of 49 when divided by 11 are 5,3,4,9,1,5, respectively; thus the remainders of the 10th, 15th, ..., 40th powers are 1 again, and the 41st is 5.[^0][^0]:    { }^{1} We can also arrive at this conclusion as follows: 5342^{82}-7^{82} is divisible by 5342-7=11 cdot 485, and thus by 11 as well; however, this does not show how the number 7 came into our consideration.    { }^{2} See, for example, Kürschák-Hajós-Neukomm-Surányi: Mathematical Competition Problems, Part I, Secondary School Special Topics, Tankönyvkiadó 1955, pp. 58 and 45; or: Faragó László: Elements of Number Theory, Secondary School Special Topics, Tankönyvkiadó 1954, pp. 75 and 48."},{"problem":"Travis spikes his hair using gel.

Part 1: Average Number of Computers Infected in Each RoundLet's denote x as the average number of computers one computer infects in each round. After two rounds of infection, the total number of infected computers is given by the initial computer plus the computers it infects in the first round, plus the computers those infected in the first round go on to infect in the second round. This can be represented as:[1 + x + x^2 = 81]This equation simplifies to:[(1 + x)^2 = 81]Taking the square root of both sides gives us two possible equations:[1 + x = 9 quad text{or} quad 1 + x = -9]Solving these for x gives:[x = 9 - 1 = 8 quad text{and} quad x = -9 - 1 = -10]We discard x = -10 since a negative number of infections doesn't make sense in this context.

The last four players played 6 games among themselves, so the total number of points they scored together is at least 6. The player who finished in 2nd place, therefore, scored at least 6 points.

The player in 2nd place, therefore, scored exactly 6 points. However, the last four players also scored exactly this many points in total, so they could only have earned these points from games against each other, which means they lost all their games against players in the first half of the final ranking.

If they do not intersect, then the remaining number is zero (since the sum of the numbers in each of these groups is half the sum of all the numbers).

Let ( p ) be a prime number that can be written both as a sum of two primes and as a difference of two primes.

Since ( p ) is a prime number greater than 2 (as 2 cannot be written as a difference of two primes), we consider the cases where ( q ) and ( r ) are both greater than 3. If both ( q ) and ( r ) are greater than 3, then ( p ) would be even and greater than 2, which would make ( p ) composite. Therefore, one of ( q ) or ( r ) must be 2.3. Without loss of generality, let ( r = 2 ). Then:   [   p = q + 2   ]   where ( q ) is a prime number.4. Similarly, from ( p = s - t ), since ( p > 2 ), we must have ( t = 2 ). Therefore:   [   p = s - 2   ]   where ( s ) is a prime number.5. Combining these results, we have:   [   p = q + 2 quad text{and} quad p = s - 2   ]   which implies:   [   q + 2 = s - 2 implies s = q + 4   ]6. Therefore, ( p ), ( p - 2 ), and ( p + 2 ) must all be primes. Consider these numbers modulo 3:   - If ( p equiv 0 pmod{3} ), then ( p ) must be 3, but 3 cannot be written as a difference of two primes.   - If ( p equiv 1 pmod{3} ), then ( p - 2 equiv -1 equiv 2 pmod{3} ) and ( p + 2 equiv 3 equiv 0 pmod{3} ). Since ( p + 2 ) is divisible by 3, it must be 3, but ( p + 2 > 3 ).   - If ( p equiv 2 pmod{3} ), then ( p - 2 equiv 0 pmod{3} ) and ( p - 2 ) must be 3. Therefore, ( p - 2 = 3 implies p = 5 ).7.

Understanding the problem: We are given a triangle (ABC) with a perimeter of 1. The altitudes of this triangle form the side lengths of another triangle. We need to find the set of all possible values of (min(AB, BC, CA)).2. Equilateral triangle case:    - If (ABC) is an equilateral triangle, each side (s) is (frac{1}{3}) since the perimeter is 1.   - The altitude (h) of an equilateral triangle with side length (s) is given by (h = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}s).   - Therefore, the altitude of each side is (frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cdot frac{1}{3} = frac{sqrt{3}}{6}).   - The altitudes form a triangle with sides (frac{sqrt{3}}{6}), (frac{sqrt{3}}{6}), and (frac{sqrt{3}}{6}), which is also an equilateral triangle.3. Isosceles triangle case:   - Consider an isosceles triangle with sides (a, a, b) where (a + a + b = 1), so (2a + b = 1).   - The altitude to the base (b) is (sqrt{a^2 - left(frac{b}{2}right)^2}).   - The altitude to each of the equal sides (a) is (frac{b}{2}).4. General triangle case:   - Let the sides of the triangle be (a, b, c) with (a + b + c = 1).   - The altitudes corresponding to these sides are given by:     [     h_a = frac{2A}{a}, quad h_b = frac{2A}{b}, quad h_c = frac{2A}{c}     ]     where (A) is the area of the triangle.   - For the altitudes to form a triangle, the sum of any two altitudes must be greater than the third altitude.5. Finding the minimum side:   - We need to find the minimum value of (min(a, b, c)).   - Assume (a leq b leq c), then (a) is the minimum side.   - We need to ensure that the altitudes form a triangle, which imposes constraints on (a, b, c).6. Inequality constraints:   - The altitudes form a triangle if:     [     frac{2A}{a} + frac{2A}{b} > frac{2A}{c}, quad frac{2A}{b} + frac{2A}{c} > frac{2A}{a}, quad frac{2A}{c} + frac{2A}{a} > frac{2A}{b}     ]   - Simplifying, we get:     [     frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} > frac{1}{c}, quad frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} > frac{1}{a}, quad frac{1}{c} + frac{1}{a} > frac{1}{b}     ]7.

This indicates that the higher the temperature, the faster the speed of sound, not slower.  - Therefore, statement B is incorrect because it suggests the opposite of what the data shows.- Statement C Analysis:  - According to the table, when the air temperature is 20^{circ}C, the speed of sound is indeed 342m/s.  - This means statement C is correct as it accurately reflects the data provided in the table.- Statement D Analysis:  - To verify this statement, we can calculate the difference in the speed of sound for every 10^{circ}C increase in temperature:    - From -20^{circ}C to -10^{circ}C: 324m/s - 318m/s = 6m/s    - From -10^{circ}C to 0^{circ}C: 330m/s - 324m/s = 6m/s    - From 0^{circ}C to 10^{circ}C: 336m/s - 330m/s = 6m/s    - From 10^{circ}C to 20^{circ}C: 342m/s - 336m/s = 6m/s    - From 20^{circ}C to 30^{circ}C: 348m/s - 342m/s = 6m/s  - These calculations show that for every 10^{circ}C increase in temperature, the speed of sound increases by 6m/s, confirming that statement D is correct.Given the analysis above, the incorrect statement among the options provided is B, as it contradicts the observed relationship between temperature and the speed of sound in the data.Therefore, the answer is: boxed{text{B}}."},{"problem":"## Task ConditionApproximately calculate using the differential.y=x^{6}, x=2.01","solution":"## SolutionIf the increment Delta x = x - x_{0} of the argument x is small in absolute value, thenf(x) = fleft(x_{0} + Delta xright) approx fleft(x_{0}right) + f^{prime}left(x_{0}right) cdot Delta xChoose:x_{0} = 2Then:Delta x = 0.01Calculate:y(2) = 2^{6} = 64y^{prime} = left(x^{6}right)^{prime} = 6 x^{5}y^{prime}(2) = 6 cdot 2^{5} = 192We get:y(2.01) approx y(2) + y^{prime}(2) cdot 0.01 = 64 + 192 cdot 0.01 = 65.92Problem Kuznetsov Differentiation 5-13"},{"problem":"Given that the function f(x) is an odd function defined on the domain mathbb{R}, and when x>0, f(x)=4^x-mx, and f(2)=2f(-1), then the value of the real number m is ( )A: 0  B: 6  C: 4  D: 2","solution":"Since f(x) is an odd function defined on the domain mathbb{R}, we have f(-1)=-f(1).

Let's examine the sum sum frac{1}{x y} for a few values of n. For n=1, there is only one pair of numbers: frac{1}{1 cdot 1}=1. If n=2, there are two pairs of numbers (1 ; 2) and (2 ; 1), the sum is frac{1}{1 cdot 2}+frac{1}{2 cdot 1}=1.

We will prove this statement by induction. Assume that the inductive hypothesis is true for n=k. We need to show that the statement is also true for n=(k+1). The sum decreases by the sum of frac{1}{x y} fractions where x+y=k+1, as these still satisfy x+y>k but no longer satisfy x+y>k+1. At the same time, the sum increases by the sum of frac{1}{x y} fractions where x=k+1 and y are coprime, and those where y=k+1 and x are coprime. These pairs have not appeared before, as each number was smaller than k+1.It is known that if x and y are coprime, then (x+y ; x)=1 and (x+y ; y)=1. If (x+y) and x had a common divisor greater than 1, then it would also divide the difference of the two numbers, i.e., y, which contradicts the fact that x and y are coprime. With this knowledge, we will show that the sum decreases by exactly the same amount as it increases. We previously saw that for every pair of numbers (x, y), two pairs, (x+y ; x) and (x+y ; y), can be assigned, for whichfrac{1}{(x+y) x}+frac{1}{(x+y) y}=frac{1}{x+y}left(frac{1}{x}+frac{1}{y}right)=frac{1}{x+y} cdot frac{x+y}{x y}=frac{1}{x y}We also see that for each term that increases the sum, a pair (x ; y) can be assigned: if x+y=k+1 and x are coprime, then x and y are also coprime. Therefore, the correspondence is one-to-one. This proves that if n changes from k to (k+1), the sum remains 1.Thus, the sum of the fractions in the problem is 1 for every positive integer n."},{"problem":"Let the rest energy of a particle be E.

At least one of the resulting two smaller ones  triangles is similar to the original. What can be the leg of the original triangle if the length of its base is 1 unit?","solution":"We are given an isosceles triangle with a base of length 1 unit. We need to determine the possible lengths of the legs of the triangle when one of the angle bisectors is drawn, resulting in at least one of the smaller triangles being similar to the original triangle. Case 1: Angle Bisector of the Angle Opposite the Base1. Identify the Triangle Type:   - Drawing the angle bisector of the angle opposite the base in an isosceles triangle results in two right triangles.   - Therefore, the original triangle must be a right triangle.   - Since it is an isosceles right triangle, the two legs are equal, and the base is the hypotenuse.2. Calculate the Leg Length:   - In an isosceles right triangle, the legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is (1) unit.   - Using the Pythagorean theorem, if the legs are (l), then:     [     l^2 + l^2 = 1^2 implies 2l^2 = 1 implies l^2 = frac{1}{2} implies l = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}     ] Case 2: Angle Bisector of One of the Other Two Angles1. Determine the Angle:   - Let the vertex angle be (2alpha). The base angles are (alpha).   - Drawing the angle bisector of one of the base angles results in two smaller triangles.   - By the angle bisector theorem and similarity conditions, we need to find (alpha) such that one of the smaller triangles is similar to the original triangle.   - Given the condition (pi - 4alpha = alpha), we solve for (alpha):     [     pi - 4alpha = alpha implies pi = 5alpha implies alpha = frac{pi}{5}     ]2. Calculate the Leg Length Using the Law of Sines:   - In the original triangle, the base is (1) unit, and the legs are (l).   - Using the Law of Sines:     [     frac{l}{sin(2alpha)} = frac{1}{sin(alpha)}     ]   - Substitute (alpha = frac{pi}{5}):     [     sin(2alpha) = sinleft(frac{2pi}{5}right) quad text{and} quad sin(alpha) = sinleft(frac{pi}{5}right)     ]   - Using the double-angle identity for sine:     [     sinleft(frac{2pi}{5}right) = 2 sinleft(frac{pi}{5}right) cosleft(frac{pi}{5}right)     ]   - Therefore:     [     frac{l}{2 sinleft(frac{pi}{5}right) cosleft(frac{pi}{5}right)} = frac{1}{sinleft(frac{pi}{5}right)} implies l = 2 cosleft(frac{pi}{5}right)     ]   - Knowing that (cosleft(frac{pi}{5}right) = frac{sqrt{5} + 1}{4}):     [     l = 2 cdot frac{sqrt{5} + 1}{4} = frac{sqrt{5} + 1}{2}     ]Conclusion:- In Case 1, the leg length is (frac{sqrt{2}}{2}).- In Case 2, the leg length is (frac{sqrt{5} + 1}{2}).The final answer is (boxed{frac{sqrt{2}}{2} text{ or } frac{sqrt{5} + 1}{2}})"},{"problem":"## 29.

This number can be written as 10a + b.2. When the digits are interchanged, the number becomes overline{ba}, which can be written as 10b + a.3. According to the problem, the number is sabroso if the sum of the number and its digit-reversed form is a perfect square. Therefore, we need:   [   (10a + b) + (10b + a) = 11a + 11b = 11(a + b)   ]4. For 11(a + b) to be a perfect square, a + b must be such that 11(a + b) is a perfect square. Let 11(a + b) = k^2 for some integer k.5. Since a and b are digits of a two-digit number, a ranges from 1 to 9 and b ranges from 0 to 9. Therefore, a + b ranges from 1 to 18.6. We need to find a + b such that 11(a + b) is a perfect square. The possible values of k^2 that are multiples of 11 and within the range of 11 times 1 to 11 times 18 are:   [   11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 110, 121, 132, 143, 154, 165, 176, 187, 198   ]7. Among these, the only perfect square is 121, which corresponds to k = 11. Therefore:   [   11(a + b) = 121 implies a + b = 11   ]8. Now, we find all pairs (a, b) such that a + b = 11 and a and b are digits:   [   (a, b) = (2, 9), (3, 8), (4, 7), (5, 6), (6, 5), (7, 4), (8, 3), (9, 2)   ]9.

We need to show that this expression can be written in the form (frac{2^{p(n)} - 1}{2^{q(n)} - 1}) for some functions (p(n)) and (q(n)).2. Notice that (16^n = (2^4)^n = 2^{4n}) and (4^n = (2^2)^n = 2^{2n}). Therefore, the given expression can be rewritten as:   [   16^n + 4^n + 1 = 2^{4n} + 2^{2n} + 1   ]3. We recognize that (2^{4n} + 2^{2n} + 1) can be seen as a sum of terms in a geometric series with the common ratio (2^{2n}).

Find the bases z of all number systems in which the four-digit number (1001)_{z} is divisible by the two-digit number (41)_{z}.","solution":"1. Since the digit 4 appears in the notation of a two-digit number, it necessarily follows that z geq 5.

The factorization (1) can also be easily revealed by using the known formula a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2): according to this, we can write directly4^3 (z^3 + 1) = (4^3 z^3 + 1) + 63 = (4z + 1)(16z^2 - 4z + 1) + 63.For a complete solution, award 6 points.

Understand how to get mathbf{0}, mathbf{1}.## SolutionGiven two numbers boldsymbol{a}, boldsymbol{b} . mathbf{1} ) If we take the pair (a;a), the machine will correspond this pair to the number 0. 2) If we take the pair ( mathbf{( ; b )} ), the machine will correspond this pair to the number 1. 3) If we take the pair (1-a:b;1), the machine will correspond this pair to the number boldsymbol{a}: boldsymbol{b}. Indeed, the machine will associate the given pair with the number 1-(1-a:b):1=a:b. Thus, we have LEARNED to DIVIDE known numbers. 4) Since we have already learned to divide, we can obtain the number mathbf{1 : b}, and then we can obtain the number boldsymbol{a}:(mathbf{1}: boldsymbol{b})=boldsymbol{a} * boldsymbol{b}. We have LEARNED to MULTIPLY. 5) By dividing the number mathbf{1 - a : boldsymbol { b }} by mathbf{1 : b}, we get the number boldsymbol{b}-boldsymbol{a}. We have found the difference. 6) By subtracting the numbers boldsymbol{b}-boldsymbol{a} and boldsymbol{b}, we get the number - boldsymbol{a}. It remains to subtract the number boldsymbol{b} from the number - boldsymbol{a}, i.e., to write boldsymbol{b}-(-boldsymbol{a})=boldsymbol{b}+boldsymbol{a}.

Understanding the problem: We have two intersecting circles with centers ( A ) and ( B ). The minor arc ( angle{XY} ) is ( 120^circ ) with respect to circle ( A ) and ( 60^circ ) with respect to circle ( B ). The length of the chord ( XY ) is given as 2 units. We need to find the area shared by the two circles.2. Angles and Orthogonality:    - Given ( angle AXY = 120^circ ) and ( angle BXY = 60^circ ), we can deduce that ( angle AXY + angle BXY = 120^circ + 60^circ = 180^circ ). This implies that the circles intersect orthogonally (i.e., at right angles).3. Radius Calculation:   - For circle ( A ), the central angle ( angle XAY = 120^circ ). Using the chord length formula in a circle, we have:     [     XY = 2R sinleft(frac{theta}{2}right)     ]     where ( R ) is the radius and ( theta ) is the central angle. For circle ( A ):     [     2 = 2R sinleft(frac{120^circ}{2}right) = 2R sin(60^circ) = 2R cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = Rsqrt{3}     ]     Thus, ( R = frac{2}{sqrt{3}} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ).   - For circle ( B ), the central angle ( angle XBY = 60^circ ).

Condition Analysis:   We need both ( a ) and ( a+1 ) to be quadratic residues modulo ( 1009 ). This translates to:   [   left( frac{a}{1009} right) = 1 quad text{and} quad left( frac{a+1}{1009} right) = 1   ]4. Summation Approach:   Consider the sum:   [   sum_{a=1}^{1007} left( 1 + left( frac{a}{1009} right) right) left( 1 + left( frac{a+1}{1009} right) right)   ]   Expanding this sum:   [   sum_{a=1}^{1007} left( 1 + left( frac{a}{1009} right) + left( frac{a+1}{1009} right) + left( frac{a}{1009} right) left( frac{a+1}{1009} right) right)   ]5. Simplification:   Since ( left( frac{a}{1009} right) ) and ( left( frac{a+1}{1009} right) ) are either ( 1 ) or ( -1 ), the product ( left( frac{a}{1009} right) left( frac{a+1}{1009} right) ) can be simplified using properties of Legendre symbols:   [   left( frac{a(a+1)}{1009} right)   ]   We need to count the number of ( a ) such that both terms are ( 1 ).6. Counting Valid ( a ):   Since there are ( frac{1009+1}{2} = 505 ) quadratic residues modulo ( 1009 ), the probability that a randomly chosen ( a ) is a quadratic residue is ( frac{505}{1009} ). Similarly, the probability that ( a+1 ) is a quadratic residue is also ( frac{505}{1009} ).   The probability that both ( a ) and ( a+1 ) are quadratic residues is:   [   left( frac{505}{1009} right)^2 = frac{505^2}{1009^2}   ]   Therefore, the expected number of such ( a ) in the range ( 1 leq a leq 1007 ) is:   [   1007 cdot frac{505^2}{1009^2}   ]7. Final Calculation:   Simplifying the above expression:   [   1007 cdot frac{505^2}{1009^2} approx 1007 cdot frac{1}{4} = 251.75   ]   Since ( a ) must be an integer, we round to the nearest integer, which is ( 251 ).The final answer is (boxed{251})."},{"problem":"37.

First construct a rhombus A using two sides of a regular 2 n-gon. On the two interior sides construct two rhombuses B using a side adjacent and clockwise to the exterior sides of A. On the three interior sides of the B rhombuses construct three rhombuses C using the next side of the 2 n-gon going clockwise. After the (n-2)^{n d} step an outer layer of n-2 rhombuses is in place. To see that the (n-1)^{text {st }} step completes the 2 n-gon note that the (n+1)^{s t} side after the first side of A is parallel and equal in length to the first side of A and has the same length as the nth side of the 2 n-gon. Therefore it is a rhombus. In the same way, the remaining n-1 sides of the 2 n-gon form rhombuses with segments parallel to the n^{text {th }} side.

We proceed by induction on n. Certainly the result is true for n=2, since a 4 -sided EP-gon is simply a single rhombus.For the inductive step, suppose we have (2 n+2)-sided EP-gon. We will use the leftmost figure above for reference; thus in this case n=4. Select one side of this polygon (we will use the \\"bottom\\" side in the picture, one of the sides of rhombus A ). Then draw n-1 lines parallel to this side with lengths equal to this side, each line starting at a vertex of the polygon. Then draw n lines parallel to the sides of the polygon; when we are done we will have drawn a \\"shell\\" of n rhombuses on the left of the polygon (rhombus A and the leftmost rhombuses B, C, and D ). We claim that the remainder of the (2 n+2)-gon (the non-tiled region) is a 2 n-sided EP-gon. To see this, note that the untiled region consists of n sides of the right half of the original (2 n+2)-gon, plus n new sides, each drawn parallel(and equal in length) to a side of the left half of the original (2 n+2)-gon. It is as if we rigidly slided the left half of the original (2 n+2)-gon to the right, so that the top and bottom sides of the original polygon disappeared. Thus in this new region, opposite sides are parallel. By the inductive hypothesis, this region can be tiled with 1+2+cdots+(n-1) rhombuses.

Indeed, by setting a=1 and b=3, we get:frac{1}{600}+frac{3}{700}=frac{7 times 1}{7 times 600}+frac{6 times 3}{6 times 700}=frac{7+18}{4200}=frac{25}{4200}=frac{1}{168}The fractions frac{1}{600} and frac{3}{700} are indeed irreducible, and the fraction frac{1}{168} is also irreducible.Now, let's show that the denominator cannot be less than 168. The sum we are interested in can be written as:frac{a}{600}+frac{b}{700}=frac{7 a}{7 times 600}+frac{6 b}{6 times 700}=frac{7 a+6 b}{4200}Since the fraction frac{a}{600} is irreducible, a is coprime with 600 (i.e., there is no number that divides both a and 600).

Similarly, b is coprime with 700 and 700=2^{2} times 5^{2} times 7, so b is not divisible by 2, 5, or 7.We deduce that the product 7a is divisible by 7, but not by 2, 3, or 5. Similarly, 6b is divisible by 2 and 3, but not by 7. Since the sum of a number divisible by p and a number not divisible by p is never divisible by p, we deduce that the sum 7a + 6b is not divisible by 2, 3, or 7.We have 4200=2^{3} times 3 times 5^{2} times 7. According to the above, we can never simplify the fraction frac{7a + 6b}{4200} by 2, 3, or 7.

Therefore, every line in the family ax+by+c=0 will always pass through point Q (1, -2).Since the perpendicular from point P (-3, 2) to the line ax+by+c=0 meets it at point M, this means PM perp QM, and thus the locus of point M is a circle with diameter PQ.The center C of the circle lies at the midpoint of PQ, which is C(-1, 0), and the radius r is half the distance of PQ:r = frac{1}{2} lvert PQ rvert = frac{1}{2} sqrt{16 + 16} = 2sqrt{2}Now, considering point N (2, 3), the distance from N to the center C is:lvert NC rvert = sqrt{9 + 9} = 3sqrt{2}The minimum length of MN, |MN|_{text{min}}, will be the distance from N to the circle subtracting the radius:|MN|_{text{min}} = lvert NC rvert - r = 3sqrt{2} - 2sqrt{2} = sqrt{2}The maximum length of MN, |MN|_{text{max}}, will be the distance from N to the circle plus the radius:|MN|_{text{max}} = lvert NC rvert + r = 3sqrt{2} + 2sqrt{2} = 5sqrt{2}Therefore, the range of possible lengths for segment MN is boxed{left[sqrt{2}, 5sqrt{2}right]}."},{"problem":"Two identical equilateral triangles A B C and C D E with side length 1 are positioned such that they share only one common point C and the angle B C D is less than 60^{circ}.

Note that (P_{2015}) is the sum of the points (1omega^0, 2omega^1, ldots, 2015omega^{2014}) by translating each move to the origin. Hence, we want to evaluate (1omega^0 + 2omega^1 + ldots + 2015omega^{2014}).2. Consider the polynomial (P(x) = frac{x^{2016} - 1}{x - 1} = x^{2015} + x^{2014} + ldots + 1). Then,   [   P'(x) = frac{d}{dx} left( frac{x^{2016} - 1}{x - 1} right)   ]   Using the quotient rule, we get:   [   P'(x) = frac{(2016x^{2015})(x - 1) - (x^{2016} - 1)}{(x - 1)^2} = frac{2016x^{2015}(x - 1) - (x^{2016} - 1)}{(x - 1)^2}   ]   Simplifying the numerator:   [   P'(x) = frac{2016x^{2015}x - 2016x^{2015} - x^{2016} + 1}{(x - 1)^2} = frac{2015x^{2016} - 2016x^{2015} + 1}{(x - 1)^2}   ]   This simplifies to:   [   P'(x) = 2015x^{2014} + 2014x^{2013} + ldots + 1   ]3. We seek (P'(omega)). Since (x^{12} = 1), we can write:   [   P'(omega) = frac{2016 - frac{2016}{omega}}{(omega - 1)^2} = frac{2016}{omega(omega - 1)} = frac{2016}{omega^2 - omega}   ]4. Now, (omega = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + frac{1}{2}i) and (omega^2 = frac{1}{2} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}i). Hence,   [   omega^2 - omega = left( frac{1}{2} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}i right) - left( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + frac{1}{2}i right) = frac{1}{2} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}i - frac{1}{2}i   ]   Simplifying further:   [   omega^2 - omega = frac{1 - sqrt{3}}{2} + frac{sqrt{3} - 1}{2}i   ]5. Therefore,   [   P'(omega) = frac{2016}{frac{1 - sqrt{3}}{2} + frac{sqrt{3} - 1}{2}i} = frac{2016 cdot 2}{(1 - sqrt{3}) + (sqrt{3} - 1)i} = frac{4032}{1 - sqrt{3} + (sqrt{3} - 1)i}   ]6. To simplify, multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:   [   P'(omega) = frac{4032 (1 + sqrt{3} - (sqrt{3} - 1)i)}{(1 - sqrt{3})^2 - (sqrt{3} - 1)^2}   ]   Simplifying the denominator:   [   (1 - sqrt{3})^2 - (sqrt{3} - 1)^2 = (1 - sqrt{3})^2 - (sqrt{3} - 1)^2 = 1 - 2sqrt{3} + 3 - (3 - 2sqrt{3} + 1) = 4 - 4 = 0   ]   This indicates a mistake in the simplification process. Instead, we should directly use the magnitude approach.7. The magnitude of (P'(omega)) is:   [   |P'(omega)| = left| frac{2016}{omega^2 - omega} right| = frac{2016}{|omega^2 - omega|}   ]   Since (|omega| = 1), we have:   [   |omega^2 - omega| = left| frac{1 - sqrt{3}}{2} + frac{sqrt{3} - 1}{2}i right| = sqrt{left( frac{1 - sqrt{3}}{2} right)^2 + left( frac{sqrt{3} - 1}{2}i right)^2} = sqrt{frac{(1 - sqrt{3})^2 + (sqrt{3} - 1)^2}{4}}   ]   Simplifying:   [   = sqrt{frac{1 - 2sqrt{3} + 3 + 3 - 2sqrt{3} + 1}{4}} = sqrt{frac{8 - 4sqrt{3}}{4}} = sqrt{2 - sqrt{3}}   ]8. Therefore,   [   |P'(omega)| = frac{2016}{sqrt{2 - sqrt{3}}}   ]9. Finally, we need to find the value of (a + b + c + d) where (asqrt{b} + csqrt{d}) represents the distance. From the simplification, we get:   [   1008sqrt{2} + 1008sqrt{6}   ]   Thus, (a = 1008), (b = 2), (c = 1008), and (d = 6).

Suppose A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2) are the intersection points between the line and the ellipse.By setting the system of equations:begin{cases} x^2 + 2y^2 = 8  y = kx + m end{cases},and eliminating y, we obtain (1 + 2k^2)x^2 + 4kmx + 2m^2 - 8 = 0.From which we determine x_1 + x_2 = -frac{4km}{1 + 2k^2} and x_1x_2 = frac{2m^2 - 8}{1 + 2k^2}.Therefore, y_1 + y_2 = k(x_1 + x_2) + 2m = frac{2m}{1 + 2k^2} and y_1y_2 = k^2x_1x_2 + km(x_1 + x_2) + m^2 = frac{m^2 - 8k^2}{1 + 2k^2}.Since we are given point M(0,2) and that the product of the slopes of lines AM and BM is -frac{1}{2}, we have:k_1 cdot k_2 = frac{y_1 - 2}{x_1} cdot frac{y_2 - 2}{x_2} = frac{y_1y_2 - 2(y_1 + y_2) + 4}{x_1x_2} = frac{m - 2}{2(m + 2)} = -frac{1}{2}.Solving this, we find m = 0.Thus, the equation of the line l becomes y = kx, and the midpoint of the line segment AB is the origin (0,0). Using the chord length formula, we deduce:|AB| = sqrt{1 + k^2} sqrt{(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2} = sqrt{frac{32(k^2 + 1)}{1 + 2k^2}}.Since we have |AN| = |BN|, the line ON bisects segment AB at a right angle.For k neq 0, let us assume the equation of the line ON is y = -frac{1}{k}x.

(1) If A, B, and C form an arithmetic progression, find the value of q.  (2) Determine the range of possible values for q.","solution":"(1) Since triangle ABC has angles A, B, and C forming an arithmetic progression, we have 2B = A + C. Knowing that A + B + C = 180^circ, we can deduce that B = 60^circ and A + C = 120^circ.Since a, b, and c form a geometric progression, we have b^2 = ac. By the Law of Sines, we get sin^2 B = sin A sin C. Plugging in the value of B we have left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)^2 = sin A sin(120^circ - A). Expanding the right side using the sine of sum and double angle formulas, we obtain frac{3}{4} = sin A left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cos A + frac{1}{2}sin Aright) = frac{sqrt{3}}{4}sin 2A + frac{1}{4}sin^2 A. Rearranging gives us sin^2 A + sqrt{3} sin 2A = 1. Now, let's consider the identity sin^2 A = frac{1 - cos 2A}{2}, and substitute it into our equation, leading to 1 - cos 2A + sqrt{3}sin 2A = 2, which simplifies to sin(2A - 30^circ) = sin 150^circ = frac{1}{2}. Hence, 2A - 30^circ = 150^circ, which means A = 90^circ. However, this cannot be true as it doesn't allow the angles to be in an arithmetic progression since 90^circ would be the largest angle and B is already 60^circ. Let's correct the step with the sine identity: frac{3}{4} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4}sin 2A + frac{1}{4}sin^2 A. Rearranging and simplifying we find sin^2 A + sqrt{3} sin 2A = 1. We examine this equation to find an angle A which will fit into our conditions. We rewrite this as a quadratic equation in sin A and solve for sin A: sin^2 A + 2sin A cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cos A - frac{1}{4} = 0. This equation is tricky to solve without more context, so let's check our previous computations.Re-evaluating the earlier computation with: frac{3}{4} = sin A left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cos A + frac{1}{2}sin Aright), gives us: sin A cos A = frac{sqrt{3}}{4}sin A and sin^2 A = frac{1}{4}. From this, knowing that sin^2 A = frac{1}{4}, we can determine sin A = frac{1}{2} quad text{or} quad sin A = -frac{1}{2}. Since we are dealing with angles within a triangle, negative solutions for sin A are not viable. Thus, sin A = frac{1}{2}, which yields A = 30^circ quad text{or} quad A = 150^circ. However, A = 150^circ is not consistent with a triangle whose angles are in arithmetic progression with B = 60^circ. Therefore, we conclude A = 30^circ. From this, we can infer that C = 180^circ - A - B = 180^circ - 30^circ - 60^circ = 90^circ, which means triangle ABC is a 30-60-90 triangle. Following the original geometric progression of the sides, we have: b = a cdot q quad text{and} quad c = a cdot q^2. Since B = 60^circ, by the Law of Sines, we have: frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C}, Substituting and solving for q: frac{a cdot q}{sin 60^circ} = frac{a cdot q^2}{sin 90^circ},  frac{q}{sqrt{3}/2} = frac{q^2}{1},  q = sqrt{3}/2 cdot q^2,  q = sqrt{3}, which contradicts our earlier finding that the triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle with sides in geometric progression. So there is a mistake here. Let's go back to our initial equation: frac{3}{4} = sin A sin(120^circ - A). Using the sine of a difference formula we have sin A (sin 120^circ cos A - cos 120^circ sin A) = frac{3}{4}. Substituting known values, this becomes sin A left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cos A - left(-frac{1}{2}right) sin Aright) = frac{3}{4}. Solving for sin A leads to frac{sqrt{3}}{2} sin A cos A + frac{1}{2} sin^2 A = frac{3}{4}. This can be further simplified to sin A cos A = frac{1}{sqrt{3}} - frac{sin^2 A}{sqrt{3}}. Substituting the double angle identity, sin 2A = 2sin A cos A, we have 2sin A cos A + sin^2 A = 1. Comparing the left-hand side to the expansion of sin(A + 30^circ)^2, we can deduce that sin^2(A + 30^circ) = 1. This tells us that A + 30^circ = 90^circ quad text{or} quad A + 30^circ = 270^circ. Therefore, we get A = 60^circ quad text{or} quad A = 240^circ. Considering A must be an angle in a triangle, the only viable solution is A = 60^circ. This means that triangle ABC is indeed an equilateral triangle, and thus the sides are in equal proportion: boxed{q = 1}. (2) Considering the triangle's sides a, aq, and aq^2, the triangle inequality must hold for any two sides. Therefore, we must have a + aq > aq^2,  a + aq^2 > aq,  aq + aq^2 > a. Dividing each inequality by a yields: 1 + q > q^2,  1 + q^2 > q,  q + q^2 > 1. Now let's focus on the first inequality: 1 + q > q^2. This is a quadratic inequality in the form of q^2 - q - 1  q, which simplifies to q^2 - q + 1 > 0, is always true for all real q because the discriminant is negative (Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-1)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 1 = -3  1, can be written as q^2 + q - 1 > 0, which again has the same roots as the first inequality, so outside the interval between the roots, it holds true. However, we need q to also satisfy the first inequality, thus we don't need to adjust the range we found previously.Considering all these inequalities, the range for q where all conditions are satisfied is boxed{frac{-1 + sqrt{5}}{2} < q < frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2}}.

Considering ( x notequiv 0 pmod{p} ):   - From the first condition:     [     frac{f(x+p)}{x+p} = frac{f(x)}{x}     ]     This implies:     [     f(kp + r) = (kp + r) frac{f(r)}{r}     ]     where ( r in {1, 2, ldots, p-1} ).6. Implications for ( r ):   - Since ( r mid f(r) ), we have ( f(r) = epsilon(r) r ) where ( epsilon(r) in {-1, 1} ).   - Therefore:     [     f(x) = epsilon(x) x     ]7. Verifying the Second Condition:   - We need ( p mid x left( x^{frac{p-1}{2}} - epsilon(x) right) ).   - For ( r neq 0 ):     - If ( r^{frac{p-1}{2}} equiv 1 pmod{p} ), then ( epsilon(r) = 1 ).     - If ( r^{frac{p-1}{2}} equiv -1 pmod{p} ), then ( epsilon(r) = -1 ).8. Conclusion:   - The function ( f ) can be expressed as:     [     f(kp + r) = epsilon(r) (kp + r)     ]     where ( epsilon(r) in {-1, 1} ) and depends on the value of ( r ).The final answer is ( boxed{ f(kp + r) = epsilon(r) (kp + r) } ) where ( epsilon(r) in {-1, 1} )."},{"problem":"If the function y=f(x-2) is an even function, then the equation of the axis of symmetry for y=f(x) is _____.","solution":"Given that y=f(x-2) is an even function, it means f(x-2)=f(-x+2). This property of even functions comes from their definition, where f(x) = f(-x) for all x in the domain of f.Since f(x-2) shifts the graph of f(x) two units to the right, the axis of symmetry for the function f(x-2) would be along the y-axis (x=0), because even functions are symmetric with respect to the y-axis.To find the axis of symmetry for the original function f(x), we need to shift this axis of symmetry back the same two units to the left. Hence, the axis of symmetry for f(x) will be the vertical line that is two units to the left of the y-axis. Thus, the equation of the axis of symmetry for y=f(x) is:[boxed{x = -2}]"},{"problem":"6. Let a composition contain n>1 wagons with gold coins. There are two types of visually identical gold coins: genuine and fake. In each wagon, there are only coins of one type. Coins of the same type have the same mass, while coins of different types do not have the same mass. The mass of a genuine gold coin is known.Determine the minimum number of measurements on a digital scale that can determine which wagons contain fake gold coins, as well as the mass of a fake gold coin.(It is assumed that any number of coins can be taken from each wagon.)(Miloš Milosavljević)","solution":"6. We will prove that the minimum number of measurements is equal to 2. Let the weights of the genuine and counterfeit gold coins be denoted by x and y respectively, and let a_{i}=1 if the gold coins in the i-th wagon are counterfeit, and a_{i}=0 otherwise.In the first measurement, take one gold coin from each wagon. Then we have a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{n} = frac{n x - m_{1}}{x - y}, where m_{1} is the obtained weight. Assume that m_{1} neq n x, otherwise there are no counterfeit coins. In the second measurement, for some q in mathbb{N}, take q^{i-1} gold coins from the i-th wagon. If the obtained weight is m_{2}, we have a_{1} + q a_{2} + cdots + q^{n-1} a_{n-1} = frac{left(1 + q + cdots + q^{n-1}right) x - m_{2}}{x - y}. From this, we getfleft(a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n}right) = frac{a_{1} + q a_{2} + cdots + q^{n-1} a_{n-1}}{a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{n}} = frac{left(1 + q + cdots + q^{n-1}right) x - m_{2}}{n x - m_{1}}We want the value of f to uniquely determine a_{1}, ldots, a_{n}. Therefore, it is sufficient to show that there exists a natural number q such that the function f: {0,1}^{n} backslash {(0,0, ldots, 0)} rightarrow mathbb{R} is injective.For fixed mathfrak{a} = left(a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n}right) and mathfrak{b} = left(b_{1}, b_{2}, ldots, b_{n}right), the equality f(mathfrak{a}) = f(mathfrak{b}) is equivalent to P_{mathfrak{a}, mathfrak{b}}(q) = left(a_{n} b - b_{n} aright) q^{n-1} + cdots + left(a_{2} b - b_{2} aright) q + left(a_{1} b - b_{1} aright) = 0, where a = a_{1} + a_{2} + ldots + a_{n} neq 0 neq b_{1} + b_{2} + ldots + b_{n} = b. Therefore, if the function f is not injective, then q is a root of the polynomialP(q) = prod_{mathfrak{a}, mathfrak{b}} P_{mathfrak{a}, mathfrak{b}}(q)Since none of the polynomials P_{mathfrak{a}, mathfrak{b}} are identically zero, there are only finitely many numbers q for which P(q) = 0, so it is possible to choose q such that f is an injective function.Thus, in two measurements, we can determine a_{1}, ldots, a_{n}, i.e., the wagons with counterfeit gold coins. Finally, y is determined from the equality y = x - frac{n x - m_{1}}{a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{n}}.On the other hand, one measurement is not sufficient, because by taking k_{i} gold coins from the i-th wagon, we get the equation k_{1} a_{1} + cdots + k_{n} a_{n} = frac{k x - m}{x - y} (where k = k_{1} + cdots + k_{n}), which in general has multiple solutions. For example, two possible solutions for left(a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n}, yright) are left(1, 0, ldots, 0, x - frac{k x - m}{k_{1}}right) and left(0, 0, ldots, 1, x - frac{k x - m}{k_{n}}right)."},{"problem":"Determine the number of ordered pairs of positive integers (a, b) for which 20 a+21 b=2021.","solution":"Since a is a positive integer, the units digit of 20 a is 0 .In order for 20 a+21 b=2021, the units digit of 21 b must be 1 , and this implies that the units digit of b must be 1 .If b geq 100, then 21 b geq 2100>2021, which would mean 20 a is negative.Since a must be positive, we must have b<100.We have that b is a positive integer less than 100 and that its units digit is 1 .

This transformation allows us to explore the relationship between x and y through the parameter k.Substituting y=k(x+1) into the given circle equation left(x-1right)^{2}+y^{2}=1, we aim to understand how the line y=k(x+1) intersects with the circle. For the line to intersect with the circle, there must be real solutions to the equation formed by substituting y in the circle's equation. This leads us to consider the distance from the center of the circle to the line, which must be less than or equal to the radius of the circle for intersection points to exist.The circle's center is (1,0), and its radius is 1. The distance from a point (x_0, y_0) to a line Ax + By + C = 0 is given by frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}. Applying this formula, we find the distance from the center of the circle to the line y=k(x+1), which can be rewritten in the form kx - y + k = 0, giving us frac{|k(1+1)-0|}{sqrt{k^2+1}} as the distance.

It is clear that by rotating the entire layout by some angle, we will not change the layout (we will not get a new layout). Therefore, we can assume that the bottom glass in the layout is always fixed (does not rotate). Then the layouts (with a fixed vertical order of glasses) will differ from each other by the rotation of each of the subsequent four upper glasses by 0^{circ}, 90^{circ}, 180^{circ}, and 270^{circ} relative to the fixed bottom glass. Therefore, we will get a total of 4^{4}=256 layout options with a fixed vertical order of glasses. Adding now all possible vertical permutations of the five glasses (5!=120 options), we get the total number of possible glass layouts in a stack: 5!4^{4}=120 cdot 256=30720 pieces. But not all these layouts meet the condition of the problem. The layouts that meet the condition of the problem are only those in which the entire stack turns out to be vertically opaque. Consider the columns of triangles located above each of the four fixed triangles of the bottom glass. The condition of the problem will be met when each of these four columns is opaque. One of these columns is already opaque by default (the one standing on the bottom shaded triangle). Consider the ordered set (vector) of possible angles of rotation (for definiteness, clockwise) of the shaded triangles on each of the 4 upper glasses relative to the bottom shaded triangle: left(alpha_{1}, alpha_{2}, alpha_{3}, alpha_{4}right), where alpha_{k} inleft{0^{circ}, 90^{circ}, 180^{circ}, 270^{circ}right}, k=1,2,3,4.All \\"columns\\" of glass triangles will be opaque if in this set of rotation angles there is at least one angle 90^{circ}, at least one angle 180^{circ}, and at least one angle 270^{circ} (while the angle 0^{circ} does not have to appear, although it will not hurt if it does appear). To count the total number of such sets (and thus the number of layouts with a fixed vertical order of glasses), we will divide them into four groups:- sets in which all rotation angles are different, i.e., all alpha_{k} are pairwise different; there are a total of 4!=24 such sets (due to permutations);- sets in which the rotation angles 180^{circ} and 270^{circ} appear once each, and the rotation angle 90^{circ} appears twice; there are a total of 6 cdot 2=12 such sets (here 6 is the number of positions in the vector for two angles of 90^{circ}, and 2 is the two permutations of the angles 180^{circ} and 270^{circ} in the remaining two positions);- sets in which the rotation angles 90^{circ} and 270^{circ} appear once each, and the rotation angle 180^{circ} appears twice; similarly, there are a total of 6 cdot 2=12 such sets (due to permutations);- sets in which the rotation angles 90^{circ} and 180^{circ} appear once each, and the rotation angle 270^{circ} appears twice; similarly, there are a total of 6 cdot 2=12 such sets (due to permutations).In the end, we get a total of 24+12+12+12=60 ordered sets of rotation angles that meet the required condition.

To find the number of odd integers in this range, note that the sequence of odd integers between -2037171 and 2037171 is:   [   -2037171, -2037169, -2037167, ldots, 2037167, 2037169, 2037171   ]   This sequence is an arithmetic sequence with the first term a = -2037171, the common difference d = 2, and the last term l = 2037171. The number of terms n in this sequence can be found using the formula for the n-th term of an arithmetic sequence:   [   l = a + (n-1)d   ]   Substituting the values, we get:   [   2037171 = -2037171 + (n-1) cdot 2   ]   Solving for n:   [   2037171 + 2037171 = (n-1) cdot 2   ]   [   4074342 = (n-1) cdot 2   ]   [   n-1 = frac{4074342}{2} = 2037171   ]   [   n = 2037171 + 1 = 2037172   ]Therefore, the number of integers that can be expressed in the form pm 1 pm 2 pm 3 pm cdots pm 2018 is boxed{2037172}."},{"problem":"11. find all injective functions f: mathbb{R} rightarrow mathbb{R} such that for all real numbers x neq y holdsfleft(frac{x+y}{x-y}right)=frac{f(x)+f(y)}{f(x)-f(y)}","solution":"## SolutionInserting y=0 yields the equation f(1)=(f(x)+f(0)) /(f(x)-f(0)) for x neq 0, i.e.f(x)(f(1)-1)=f(0)(f(1)+1)From this follows f(1)=1 and therefore also f(0)=0, because otherwise f would be constant on mathbb{R} backslash{0}, i.e. not injective.

Initial Setup and Zero Function:   Let ( P(x, y) ) be the assertion ( f(x)^2 - f(y)^2 = f(x+y)f(x-y) ).       First, we observe that ( f(x) = 0 ) for all ( x ) is a solution. We now look for non-zero functions. Assume there exists ( u ) such that ( f(u) neq 0 ).2. Odd Function and ( f(0) = 0 ):   - Consider ( Pleft(frac{u+x}{2}, frac{u-x}{2}right) ):     [     fleft(frac{u+x}{2}right)^2 - fleft(frac{u-x}{2}right)^2 = f(u)f(x)     ]   - Now consider ( Pleft(frac{u-x}{2}, frac{u+x}{2}right) ):     [     fleft(frac{u-x}{2}right)^2 - fleft(frac{u+x}{2}right)^2 = f(u)f(-x)     ]   - Adding these two equations, we get:     [     f(u)f(x) + f(u)f(-x) = 0 implies f(x) + f(-x) = 0 implies f(-x) = -f(x)     ]     Thus, ( f ) is an odd function. Also, setting ( x = 0 ) in the original equation, we get ( f(0)^2 - f(y)^2 = f(y)f(-y) = -f(y)^2 ), which implies ( f(0) = 0 ).3. Existence of ( v > 0 ) such that ( f(v) = 0 ):   - Assume ( f ) is injective. Since ( f ) is continuous and bounded, it must be monotonic. Let ( lim_{x to infty} f(x) = L ) and ( lim_{x to -infty} f(x) = l ).   - Consider ( P(x+u, x) ):     [     f(x+u)^2 - f(x)^2 = f(2x+u)f(u)     ]     Taking ( x to infty ), we get ( Lf(u) = 0 ), so ( L = 0 ). Similarly, taking ( x to -infty ), we get ( lf(u) = 0 ), so ( l = 0 ). This contradicts the assumption that ( f ) is not the zero function. Hence, ( f ) is not injective.   - Therefore, there exist ( b neq c ) such that ( f(b) = f(c) ). Consider ( P(b, c) ):     [     f(b+c)f(b-c) = 0     ]     If ( f(b-c) = 0 ), then ( v = |b-c| ). If ( f(b+c) = 0 ) and ( b+c neq 0 ), then ( v = |b+c| ). If ( f(b+c) = 0 ) and ( b+c = 0 ), then ( c = -b ) and ( f(b) = f(-b) = -f(b) ), so ( f(b) = 0 ). Thus, ( v = max(|b|, |c|) ).4. Existence of ( a > 0 ) such that ( f(2a) = 0 ) and ( f(x) neq 0 ) for ( x in (0, 2a) ) and ( f(x+4a) = f(x) ):   - Let ( A = { x > 0 mid f(x) = 0 } ). ( A ) is non-empty.

Let ( a = frac{1}{2} inf(A) ). Since ( f ) is continuous, ( f(2a) = 0 ). If ( a = 0 ), ( f ) would be periodic with arbitrarily small periods, implying ( f ) is constant, which is a contradiction. Thus, ( a neq 0 ), and we have ( f(x+4a) = f(x) ) and ( f(x) neq 0 ) for ( x in (0, 2a) ).5. Form of the Function:   - Since ( f(x) ) is known over ( [0, 2a] ), using ( f(-x) = -f(x) ) and ( f(x+4a) = f(x) ), we can determine ( f ) over all ( mathbb{R} ).   - Assume ( f(a) = 1 ). Consider ( P(x, 2a) ):     [     f(x+2a)^2 = f(x)^2     ]     For ( x in (0, 2a) ), ( f(x) > 0 ). Thus, ( f(x+2a) = -f(x) ) for all ( x ). Consider ( P(a-x, a) ):     [     f(a-x)^2 - 1 = f(2a-x)f(-x) = -f(x)^2 implies f(a-x)^2 + f(x)^2 = 1     ]     Let ( g(x) = f(x+a) ).

We have ( g(0) = h(0) ) and ( g(a) = h(a) ). By induction and continuity, ( g(x) = h(x) ) for all ( x in [0, a] ). Thus, ( f(x) = sinleft(frac{pi x}{2a}right) ) for ( x in (0, a) ).   - Using ( f(-x) = -f(x) ) and ( f(x+2a) = -f(x) ), we get ( f(x) = sinleft(frac{pi x}{2a}right) ) for all ( x ).Hence, the general solution is ( f(x) = b sinleft(frac{pi x}{2a}right) ) where ( b ) and ( a ) are arbitrary real numbers.The final answer is ( boxed{ f(x) = b sinleft(frac{pi x}{2a}right) } ) where ( b ) and ( a ) are arbitrary real numbers."},{"problem":"A student named Jia participates in an English speaking test.

Option A: {f'}(x) is symmetric about x=cGiven the condition f(c+x)+f(c-x)=2d, differentiating both sides with respect to x yields[{f'}(c+x) - {f'}(c-x) = 0.]This equation indicates that for every x, {f'}(c+x) = {f'}(c-x), which directly implies that {f'}(x) is symmetric about x=c. Thus, option A is correct. Option B: The period of f(2x) is 2|c-a|Given that f(a+x) is an even function, we have:[f(a+x) = f(a-x).]This implies that f(-x) = f(2a+x). Moreover, from the given condition f(c+x)+f(c-x)=2d, we can deduce:[f(-x) = 2d - f(2c+x).]Combining the two equations gives:[f(2a+x) = 2d - f(2c+x).]This relationship allows us to express f(x) in terms of a periodic function:[f(x) = 2d - f(x + 2|c-a|).]It follows that f(x + 2|c-a|) = 2d - f(x + 4|c-a|), which implies f(x) = f(x + 4|c-a|). Therefore, the period of f(x) is 4|c-a|, and thus the period of f(2x), by substitution, equals 2|c-a|. Hence, option B is correct. Option C: f(f(x)) is not symmetric about (c,d)To analyze this option, we consider the condition when c=d. Given f(c+x)+f(c-x)=2c, we can substitute c for d:[f(x)+f(2c-x)=2c.]Applying the function f to both sides in the context of f(f(x)):[f(f(c+x)) + f(f(c-x)) = 2c.]This relationship implies that f(f(x)) is symmetric about (c,c), not necessarily about (c, d) unless c=d. Therefore, option C's statement cannot be universally correct, making it incorrect in this context. Option D: f(f(x)) is symmetric about x=aSince f(a+x) is an even function, we have:[f(a+x) = f(a-x).]This symmetry implies that for any input x, f(f(a+x)) = f(f(a-x)), indicating that f(f(x)) is symmetric about x=a.

Understanding the Definition of a Funny Number:   A positive integer ( n ) is called *funny* if for all positive divisors ( d ) of ( n ), ( d+2 ) is a prime number. We need to find the funny number with the largest possible number of divisors.2. Initial Observations:   - Since ( d+2 ) must be prime for all divisors ( d ) of ( n ), ( n ) cannot be even. This is because if ( n ) were even, then ( 2 ) would be a divisor, and ( 2+2 = 4 ) is not a prime number. Therefore, ( 2 nmid n ).3. Checking Small Values:   - Let's check if ( n = 3^4 = 81 ) is funny. The divisors of ( 81 ) are ( 1, 3, 9, 27, 81 ). Adding 2 to each:     [     1+2 = 3, quad 3+2 = 5, quad 9+2 = 11, quad 27+2 = 29, quad 81+2 = 83     ]     All of these are prime numbers, so ( 81 ) is funny.   - Now, check ( n = 3^5 = 243 ). The divisors of ( 243 ) are ( 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243 ). Adding 2 to each:     [     1+2 = 3, quad 3+2 = 5, quad 9+2 = 11, quad 27+2 = 29, quad 81+2 = 83, quad 243+2 = 245     ]     ( 245 ) is not a prime number (since ( 245 = 5 times 49 )). Therefore, ( 243 ) is not funny.4. Considering Higher Powers and Other Primes:   - If ( p^2 mid n ) for some prime ( p > 3 ), then ( p+2 ) must be prime. This forces ( p equiv -1 pmod{3} ). However, ( p^2 + 2 equiv 0 pmod{3} ), which is not possible since ( p^2 + 2 ) must be prime.   - Similarly, if ( pq mid n ) for primes ( p, q > 3 ), then ( p+2 ) and ( q+2 ) must be primes, forcing ( p, q equiv -1 pmod{3} ). But ( pq + 2 equiv 0 pmod{3} ), which is not possible.5. Limiting the Form of ( n ):   - We can have at most ( n = 3^4 p ) with ( p > 3 ) prime. However, if ( p neq 5 ), then ( 5 ) divides at least one of ( p+2, 3p+2, 9p+2, 27p+2 ). For ( p = 5 ), we have ( 81p + 2 = 407 = 11 times 37 ), which is not prime.   - Therefore, we can have at most ( n = 3^3 p ), and according to the above, only for ( p = 5 ).6. Verification:   - For ( n = 3^3 times 5 = 135 ), the divisors are ( 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 27, 45, 135 ). Adding 2 to each:     [     1+2 = 3, quad 3+2 = 5, quad 5+2 = 7, quad 9+2 = 11, quad 15+2 = 17, quad 27+2 = 29, quad 45+2 = 47, quad 135+2 = 137     ]     All of these are prime numbers, so ( 135 ) is funny.Conclusion:[boxed{n = 135}]"},{"problem":"Let triangle ABC with AB=AC and BC=14 be inscribed in a circle omega.

Suppose that the number of points lying on every element of mathcal{S} is a finite number n. Find the maximum possible value of n.","solution":"Answer: 2 The answer is 2 for any number of dimensions. We prove this by induction on the dimension.Note that 1-dimensional spheres are pairs of points, and 2-dimensional spheres are circles.Base case, d=2 : The intersection of two circles is either a circle (if the original circles are identical, and in the same place), a pair of points, a single point (if the circles are tangent), or the empty set. Thus, in dimension 2, the largest finite number of intersection points is 2 , because the number of pairwise intersection points is 0,1 , or 2 for distinct circles.We now prove that the intersection of two k-dimensional spheres is either the empty set, a (k-1) dimensional sphere, a k-dimensional sphere (which only occurs if the original spheres are identical and coincident). Consider two spheres in k-dimensional space, and impose a coordinate system such that the centers of the two spheres lie on one coordinate axis. Then the equations for the two spheres become identical in all but one coordinate:begin{array}{l}left(x_{1}-a_{1}right)^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+ldots+x_{k}^{2}=r_{1}^{2} left(x_{1}-a_{2}right)^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+ldots+x_{k}^{2}=r_{2}^{2}end{array}If a_{1}=a_{2}, the spheres are concentric, and so they are either nonintersecting or coincident, intersecting in a k-dimensional sphere.

Plugging this in to either equation above yields a single equation equation that describes a (k-1)-dimensional sphere.Assume we are in dimension d, and suppose for induction that for all k less than d, any two distinct k-dimensional spheres intersecting in a finite number of points intersect in at most two points.

The graph of the power function y = x^{alpha} is symmetric about the y-axis. This implies that y = x^{alpha} must be an even function. An even function has the property that f(x) = f(-x) for all x in its domain, which in the case of power functions, means alpha must be an even integer or a positive fraction to ensure symmetry for positive and negative values of x. However, the strictly increasing nature on (0, +infty) suggests a different consideration for alpha.2. The function is strictly increasing on the interval (0, +infty). For a power function y = x^{alpha}, this means that as x increases, y also increases, which only happens if alpha > 0.

This gives us a condition:[0 leq 4x leq 8.]Dividing the entire inequality by 4 to solve for x gives:[0 leq x leq 2.]Second, for sqrt{x-1} to be valid, the expression under the square root must be greater than zero (as the square root of a negative number is not real). This gives us the condition:[x-1 > 0.]Solving this inequality for x gives:[x > 1.]Combining both conditions to find values of x that satisfy both, we get the intersection of 0 leq x leq 2 and x > 1, which results in:[1 < x leq 2.]Therefore, the domain of the function g(x) is:[boxed{(1,2]}.]"},{"problem":"There is a project that requires 6 days to complete if person A and person B work together.

Find the highest integer k, such that the player A can be sure that his score is not smaller than k.","solution":"1. Determine the total number of moves:   The total number of integers on the board is 119. Each move consists of erasing 9 numbers. The game continues until only 2 numbers remain. Therefore, the total number of moves is:   [   frac{119 - 2}{9} = frac{117}{9} = 13 text{ moves}   ]   Since player ( A ) makes the first move, ( A ) will make 7 moves and ( B ) will make 6 moves.2. Analyze ( B )'s strategy to minimize ( A )'s score:   Player ( B ) can try to minimize ( A )'s score by erasing numbers from the extremes. For example, ( B ) could erase the first 54 numbers, the last 54 numbers, or a combination of the first 27 and the last 27 numbers. In these cases, the remaining numbers would be close to each other, minimizing the difference.3. Propose a strategy for ( A ) to ensure a minimum score:   To ensure a minimum score, ( A ) can use the following strategy:   - Consider pairs of numbers ((x, x+64)). These pairs are ((1, 65), (2, 66), ldots, (55, 119)).   - Notice that the numbers 56 to 64 are not part of any pair ((x, x+64)).4. First move by ( A ):   - ( A ) erases the numbers 56 to 64. This ensures that the remaining numbers are all part of the pairs ((x, x+64)).5. Subsequent moves:   - After ( A )'s first move, both players have the same number of moves left (6 each).   - Since ( B ) moves next, ( B ) will erase 9 numbers. ( B ) will be the first to erase a number from a pair ((x, x+64)).   - ( A ) can then erase the other number from the pair in the following move.6. Ensuring the final pair:   - Regardless of ( B )'s strategy, ( A ) can always ensure that the final two numbers are from a pair ((x, x+64)).   - This is because ( A ) can always respond to ( B )'s move by erasing the corresponding number from the pair.7.
