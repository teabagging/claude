Therefore, the faces can only be triangles and quadrilaterals. Let e be the number of edges, and let the number of triangular faces be k. Then the number of quadrilateral faces is 5-k. Counting the edges of the solid face by face, we get twice the number of edges, that is,2 e=3 k+4(5-k), quad text { from which } quad k=20-2 eTherefore, k is even, and since k leq 5, only k=0,2,4 are possible.The case k=0 does not provide a solution. Indeed, there is no convex polyhedron with 5 quadrilateral faces. If 4 quadrilateral faces meet at a vertex, the fifth would need to connect to 8 edges, which is impossible. If, however, only 3 quadrilateral faces meet at each vertex, then counting the vertices face by face, the number of vertices would be frac{5 cdot 4}{3}, which is also impossible, as the result is not an integer.In the case k=2, we are talking about a solid bounded by two triangles and three quadrilaterals. Here, three quadrilateral faces cannot share a vertex, because the two triangles connected by an edge cannot fit their remaining four edges into 6 edges of quadrilaterals. Thus, the two triangles lie \\"opposite\\" each other. Such a solid can be, for example, a triangular prism, or generally, a truncated 3-sided pyramid.In the case k=4, a quadrilateral face is connected to a triangular face on each of its sides. This polyhedron is a quadrilateral-based pyramid.Therefore, there are two types of convex polyhedra with 5 faces.Remark. Some solvers used Euler's theorem for convex polyhedra, which states that f+v=e+2, where f is the number of faces, v is the number of vertices, and e is the number of edges. This gives v=e-3. Since at least three edges emanate from each vertex, 3 v leq 2 e, or v leq frac{2 e}{3}. From these two relationships, frac{2 e}{3} geq e-3, and thus e leq 9. Considering that the number of vertices is at least 5, since the only 4-vertex solid is clearly the tetrahedron, it follows that e geq 8. Therefore, two cases are possible: e=8 or e=9. The solution can now be completed similarly to the above.In this way, it can also be investigated how many types of convex polyhedra with 6 faces exist. The answer is that there are seven.The solution to the problem is also known for polyhedra with 7, 8, and 9 faces, but not for those with more than 9 faces."},{"problem":"The solution set of the inequality system left{{begin{array}{l}{2x≤-2}{x+3＜4}end{array}}right. is ____.","solution":"To solve the given system of inequalities, we proceed as follows:1.

Triangles B P D and A P C are similar with a coefficient of frac{1}{2}, hence D B = frac{1}{2} A C = A H. Therefore, A D B H is a rectangle, which means angle A D B = 90^{circ}. Note that triangles A B Q and C A P are congruent by two sides and an angle. Thenangle B D K = angle D C A = angle B A K.Thus, quadrilateral A D B K is cyclic, from which angle A K B = 180^{circ} - angle A D B = 90^{circ}.Solution 2. Draw the height C H in triangle A B C (see the right figure). Since B H = frac{1}{2} A B, we get frac{B P}{B H} = frac{2}{3} = frac{B Q}{B C}. Therefore, triangles B P Q and B H C are similar, from which angle B P Q = angle B H C = 90^{circ}. Note now that B Q = A P, A B = C A, and angle A B Q = angle C A P = 60^{circ}. Then triangles A B Q and C A P are congruent by two sides and an angle. Since angle A Q B = angle C P A = 180^{circ} - angle C P B, quadrilateral B P K Q is cyclic, from whichangle A K B = 180^{circ} - angle B K Q = 180^{circ} - angle B P Q = 90^{circ}"},{"problem":"13.

For n  7 the side has length 2R sin π/n, the shortest diagonal has length 2R sin 2π/n, and the longest diagonal has length 2R for n even and 2R cos π/2n for n odd (where R is the radius of the circumcircle). Thus we require: sin 2π/n + sin π/n = 1 and n even, or sin 2π/n + sin π/n = cos π/2n and n odd. Evidently the lhs is a strictly decreasing function of n and the rhs is an increasing function of n, so there can be at most one solution of each equation. The second equation is satisfied by n = 9, although it is easier to see that there is a quadrilateral with the longest diagonal and shortest diagonals as one pair of opposite sides, and 9-gon sides as the other pair of opposite sides. The angle between the longest side and an adjacent side is 60, so that its length is the length of the shortest diagonal plus 2 x 9-gon side x cos 60. Hence that is the only solution for n odd. For n = 8 we have the same quadrilateral as for the 9-gon except that the angle is 67.5 and hence the difference is less than 1.

The case 2^{n}<x<y leq 2^{n+1} cannot occur, as then 2^{n+1}<x+y<2^{n+2}. - On the other hand, if M is a quirky subset of B_{n+1}, then A:=M cap B_{n} is a quirky subset of B_{n}. The element y=2^{n+1}-x of B_{n+1} with 1 leq x<2^{n} is contained in M if and only if x in B_{n} is not contained in A, since x+y=2^{n+1} is a power of two. The quirkiness of M thus determines for all elements y of B_{n+1} with 2^{n}<y<2^{n+1} whether they are contained in M; only whether 2^{n+1} is an element is still free. Thus, M equals either M_{n}(A) or N_{n}(A), and exactly two quirky subsets of B_{n+1} can be assigned to each quirky subset of B_{n}. This completes the proof.Remark. Often it was mistakenly assumed that the numbers 2^{n-1} and 2^{n} could not be elements of a quirky subset of B_{n}, since for no x in B_{n} with x neq 2^{n-1} the number 2^{n-1}+x is a power of two and the same phenomenon occurs with 2^{n}. However, this situation only shows that for every X subseteq B_{n}-left{2^{n-1}, 2^{n}right} the four sets X, X cupleft{2^{n-1}right}, X cupleft{2^{n}right}, X cupleft{2^{n-1}, 2^{n}right} are either all quirky or all unquirky subsets of B_{n}."},{"problem":"12.

Determining the Focus of the Parabola: The given parabola is x^{2}=2y. The standard form of a parabola opening upwards is x^2=4ay, where the focus is at (0, a). Comparing, we find 4a=2, so a=frac{1}{2}. Therefore, the focus F is at (0, frac{1}{2}). This shows that option A, which states the focus is (frac{1}{2},0), is incorrect. Thus, we have F(0,frac{1}{2}).2. Analyzing Option B: Consider a line l that passes through the focus F and intersects the parabola at points M and N. The equation of line l can be assumed as y=kx+frac{1}{2}. Substituting y from the parabola's equation into this, we get x^{2}=2(kx+frac{1}{2}), simplifying to x^{2}-2kx-1=0.

Spacecraft need to achieve one of these three cosmic velocities depending on their mission. Let's look at each of them in turn.One, First Cosmic Velocity: The first cosmic velocity is also known as the minimum launch speed of a spacecraft, the maximum operational speed of a spacecraft, and the orbital speed. It refers to the speed at which an object can move in a circular orbit just above the Earth's surface, and it is also the minimum launch speed for artificial Earth satellites. According to mechanical theory, the first cosmic velocity is calculated to be 7.9 kilometers per second. In reality, the Earth's surface has a dense atmosphere, so spacecraft cannot orbit the Earth at such a low altitude. They need to be at a flight altitude of 150 kilometers to orbit the Earth in a circular path. Here, it is particularly important to remember: the first cosmic velocity is approximately 7.9 kilometers per second.Two, Second Cosmic Velocity: The minimum speed required for a man-made object to escape Earth's gravitational pull. When an object reaches a flight speed of 11.2 kilometers per second, it can break free from Earth's gravitational pull, leave Earth, and enter an orbit around the Sun, no longer orbiting Earth. This minimum speed to escape Earth's gravity is the second cosmic velocity. The initial flight speeds of various planetary probes are all higher than the second cosmic velocity. The second cosmic velocity is approximately 11.2 kilometers per second.Three, Third Cosmic Velocity: The minimum speed required to launch a spacecraft from the Earth's surface to escape the solar system and venture into the vast Milky Way is called the third cosmic velocity. According to mechanical theory, the third cosmic velocity is calculated to be approximately 16.7 kilometers per second. It is important to note that this value is calculated assuming the spacecraft's entry speed is in the same direction as Earth's orbital speed; if the direction is different, the required speed will be greater than 16.7 kilometers per second. In short, the speed of the spacecraft is the only factor that can break free from the gravitational pull of Earth and even the Sun, and currently, only rockets can achieve this cosmic velocity.Therefore, let's summarize the key points: The speed that allows an object to orbit the Earth in a circular path is called the first cosmic velocity, approximately 7.9 kilometers per second; the speed to escape Earth's gravitational pull and leave Earth is called the second cosmic velocity, approximately 11.2 kilometers per second; and the speed to escape the Sun's gravitational pull and leave the solar system is called the third cosmic velocity, approximately 16.7 kilometers per second."},{"problem":"The coordinates of the focus of the parabola y^2 = 4x are (   )A: (0, 2)B: (0, 1)C: (2, 0)D: (1, 0)","solution":"The coordinates of the focus of the parabola y^2 = 4x are (1, 0).

Find the length of |AB|.","solution":"To solve this problem, we follow these steps closely aligned with the given solution:1. Identify the focus of the parabola C: y^{2}=4x, which is at F(1, 0) because the vertex form of a parabola y^2=4ax has its focus at (a,0), and here 4a=4 implies a=1.2. Write the equation of the line l with slope sqrt{3} passing through F(1, 0). The slope-point form of a line is y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), where (x_1, y_1) is a point on the line and m is the slope. Substituting m=sqrt{3} and (x_1, y_1)=(1,0), we get y = sqrt{3}(x-1).3. Substitute y^2=4x into the line's equation to find the intersection points. Substituting y = sqrt{3}(x-1) into y^2=4x gives (sqrt{3}(x-1))^2 = 4x. Simplifying, we get 3(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 4x, which further simplifies to 3x^2 - 10x + 3 = 0.4. Solve for x values of points A and B using the quadratic equation. Let A(x_{1}, y_{1}) and B(x_{2}, y_{2}). From the quadratic equation, we know that the sum of roots x_{1} + x_{2} = -frac{b}{a} = frac{10}{3} and the product of roots x_{1}x_{2} = frac{c}{a} = 1.5. Calculate the length of |AB| using the properties of a parabola. The distance between points A and B on the parabola can be found by adding the sum of their x-coordinates to the parabola's parameter p (which is 2 in this case, as 4p=4).

Using the trigonometric values of special angles, we can then find the degree of (C).This problem tests the sine rule and the trigonometric values of special angles. The sine rule effectively establishes the relationship between the sides and angles of a triangle. Mastering the sine rule is key to solving this problem, and it's also important to correctly determine the range of (C)."},{"problem":"4.

We can see that this line passes through the fixed point P(2,4). Now, consider the equation of the curve, y=sqrt{4-x^2}.

Case Analysis for Odd ( n ):   - If ( n ) is odd, consider the first move by Player A.   - Player A can choose ( l = n - 2 ) (since ( n - 2 ) is an odd number and (gcd(n-2, n) = 1) for odd ( n )).   - After this move, ( k = 2 ) candies remain.   - Player B must then choose ( l = 1 ) (since (gcd(1, 2) = 1)), leaving 1 candy.   - Player A then eats the last candy and wins.   - Therefore, for odd ( n ), Player A has a winning strategy.3. Case Analysis for Even ( n ):   - If ( n ) is even, Player A must choose an odd number ( l ) such that (gcd(l, n) = 1).   - By choosing an odd ( l ), the remaining number of candies ( k = n - l ) will be odd (since even minus odd is odd).   - Now, Player B faces an odd number of candies, which we have already established is a winning position for the first player.   - Therefore, Player A can force the game into a situation where Player B faces an odd number of candies, ensuring Player A's victory.4. Conclusion:   - Player A wins if ( n ) is odd.   - Player A can also force a win if ( n ) is even by making the number of candies odd for Player B's turn.Thus, Player A has a winning strategy if and only if ( n ) is odd.The final answer is ( boxed{ n equiv 1 pmod{2} } )"},{"problem":"[ The midline of the trapezoid ]Find the midline of the trapezoid if it is known that it is one and a half times smaller than the larger base and 3 more than the smaller one.#","solution":"Let the midline of the trapezoid be x.

Define the Sets (X) and (Y):   Let (X = {a_i mid 1 leq i leq 10000}) and (Y = {x mid 10000 leq x < 20000 text{ and } x in mathbb{N}}).2. Mapping Function (f(x)):   For a number (x < 20000), there exists a unique non-negative integer (t) such that (x cdot 2^t in Y). Define (f(x)) as this unique positive integer (x cdot 2^t). For example:   [   f(12345) = 12345, quad f(4321) = 17284, quad f(700) = 11200, quad f(1) = 16384   ]3. Injectivity of (f(x)):   If (f(x) = f(y)), then (frac{x}{y} = 2^k) for some integer (k), implying one of (x) or (y) divides the other. Therefore, (f(x) neq f(y)) for all (x, y in X) with (x neq y). This shows that (f) is an injective map from (X) to (Y).4. Cardinality and Bijectivity:   Since (|X| = |Y| = 10000), (f) is a bijective map from (X) to (Y).5. Odd Integers and Function (g(x)):   For some odd (x in (0, 20000)), there exists a unique (t) such that (x cdot 2^t in Y). Let (g(x)) denote this unique (t). Define (h(x) = x cdot 2^{g(x)}). Similarly, (h) is a bijective map between the set of odd integers less than 20000 and (X).6. Claim:   We claim that (x cdot 2^{g(x)} > 500) for all odd (x in (0, 20000)).7. Proof by Contradiction:   For odd (x, y in (0, 20000)) such that (y neq 1), if (g(x) leq g(xy)), then (x cdot 2^{g(x)} mid xy cdot 2^{g(xy)}). Since both (x cdot 2^{g(x)}) and (xy cdot 2^{g(xy)}) are in (X) and distinct, this leads to a contradiction. Thus, (g(x) > g(xy)) or (g(x) geq g(xy) + 1).8.

Thus, the subset with the largest number of elements that satisfies the required property has at least 50 elements. To conclude that 50 is the largest possible number of elements of a subset that satisfies the required property, it suffices to show that every subset with more than 50 elements contains two multiples. For this, we denote B={1,2,3, ldots, 100} and divide B into 50 disjoint subsets, considering the various subsets of B whose elements are of the form odd number times 2^{k}, with k a natural number. Since there are only 50 odd numbers between 1 and 100, we obtain fifty pairwise disjoint subsets constructed in this way, as follows.- A_{1}={1,2,4,8,16,32,64}=B capleft{1 times 2^{k} midright. for some left.k=0,1,2,3, ldotsright};- A_{2}={3,6,12,24,48,96}=B capleft{3 times 2^{k} midright. for some left.k=0,1,2,3, ldotsright};- A_{3}={5,10,20,40,80}=B capleft{5 times 2^{k} midright. for some left.k=0,1,2,3, ldotsright};- A_{50}={99}=B capleft{99 times 2^{k} midright. for some left.k=0,1,2,3, ldotsright}.Observe that B is the union of these fifty subsets, that is,B={1,2, ldots, 100}=A_{1} cup A_{2} cup ldots cup A_{50}and that if two elements of B are in the same subset A_{i}, then one of them is a multiple of the other. Thus, if a subset A of B has more than 50 elements, we can assert that there are at least two elements of A in the same subset A_{i} and, therefore, one of them is a multiple of the other. This proves that 50 is the maximum number of elements of any subset of B that does not have two elements such that one is a multiple of the other."},{"problem":"Given that a and b are real numbers, and a neq 0, let f(x) = |x-1| + |x-2|.

(2) According to the problem, |x-1| + |x-2| leqslant frac{|a+b| + |a-b|}{|a|} always holds, so |x-1| + |x-2| is less than or equal to the minimum value of frac{|a+b| + |a-b|}{|a|}.

Since |x-1| + |x-2| represents the sum of the distances on the number line from the point corresponding to x to the points corresponding to 1 and 2, and since the sum of the distances from the points corresponding to frac{1}{2} and frac{5}{2} to the points corresponding to 1 and 2 equals 2, the solution set for the inequality is left[ frac{1}{2}, frac{5}{2} right],  thus, the answer is boxed{left[ frac{1}{2}, frac{5}{2} right]}."},{"problem":"30.

Equilateral Triangle: An equilateral triangle is symmetric about an axis (in fact, it has 3 axes of symmetry), but it does not have a point of symmetry (or center of symmetry) where every point on its outline has a corresponding point equidistant from the center but in the opposite direction. Therefore, it meets the criteria.2. Parallelogram: A parallelogram (excluding the special case of a square) generally has axes of symmetry if it's a rectangle or a rhombus, but it is not symmetric about a center unless it's a rhombus or a rectangle, in which case it's symmetric about the center through its diagonals. However, since a general parallelogram can vary in shape (and not all parallelograms have axis symmetry), and considering the most general case where it might not have axis symmetry but could be considered symmetric about a center through its diagonals, it's ambiguous. For the purpose of this problem, we'll consider that it does not strictly meet the criteria as intended in the solution provided.3. Regular Pentagon: A regular pentagon is symmetric about an axis (in fact, it has 5 axes of symmetry), but like the equilateral triangle, it does not have a point of symmetry. Therefore, it meets the criteria.4. Circle: A circle is symmetric about an infinite number of axes through its center, and it is also symmetric about its center. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria since it is symmetric about the center.Based on the analysis:- The equilateral triangle and regular pentagon are symmetric about an axis but not about the center.- The parallelogram and circle do not meet the specific criteria as outlined.Therefore, the number of shapes that are definitely symmetric about an axis but not about the center is 2.Thus, the correct answer is boxed{B}."},{"problem":"2.254. left(frac{x+2 y}{8 y^{3}left(x^{2}+2 x y+2 y^{2}right)}-frac{(x-2 y): 8 y^{2}}{x^{2}-2 x y+2 y^{2}}right)+left(frac{y^{-2}}{4 x^{2}-8 y^{2}}-frac{1}{4 x^{2} y^{2}+8 y^{4}}right) x=sqrt[4]{6}, quad y=sqrt[8]{2}.","solution":"Solution.begin{aligned}& left(frac{x+2 y}{8 y^{3}left(x^{2}+2 x y+2 y^{2}right)}-frac{(x-2 y): 8 y^{2}}{x^{2}-2 x y+2 y^{2}}right)+left(frac{y^{-2}}{4 x^{2}-8 y^{2}}-frac{1}{4 x^{2} y^{2}+8 y^{4}}right)= & =left(frac{x+2 y}{8 y^{3}left(x^{2}+2 x y+2 y^{2}right)}-frac{x-2 y}{8 y^{3}left(x^{2}-2 x y+2 y^{2}right)}right)+ & +left(frac{1}{4 y^{2}left(x^{2}-2 y^{2}right)}-frac{1}{4 y^{2}left(x^{2}+2 y^{2}right)}right)= & =frac{(x+2 y)left(x^{2}+2 y^{2}-2 x yright)-(x-2 y)left(x^{2}+2 y^{2}+2 x yright)}{8 y^{3}left(x^{2}+2 y^{2}+2 x yright)left(x^{2}+2 y^{2}-2 x yright)}+ & +frac{x^{2}+2 y^{2}-x^{2}+2 y^{2}}{4 y^{2}left(x^{2}-2 y^{2}right)left(x^{2}+2 y^{2}right)}=frac{8 y^{3}}{8 y^{3}left(left(x^{2}+2 y^{2}right)^{2}-(2 x y)^{2}right)}+end{aligned}begin{aligned}& +frac{4 y^{2}}{4 y^{2}left(left(x^{2}right)^{2}-left(2 y^{2}right)^{2}right)}=frac{1}{x^{4}+4 y^{4}}+frac{1}{x^{4}-4 y^{4}}= & =frac{x^{4}-4 y^{4}+x^{4}+4 y^{4}}{left(x^{4}+4 y^{4}right)left(x^{4}-4 y^{4}right)}=frac{2 x^{4}}{x^{8}-16 y^{8}}=frac{2(sqrt[4]{6})^{4}}{(sqrt[4]{6})^{8}-16(sqrt[8]{2})^{8}}= & =frac{2 cdot 6}{36-16 cdot 2}=frac{12}{36-32}=frac{12}{4}=3end{aligned}Answer: 3."},{"problem":"If the complex number z satisfies (1+i)z=2, then z=　　()A: 1+iB: 1-iC: 2+2iD: 2-2i","solution":"Given (1+i)z=2,  we have z= dfrac{2}{1+i}= dfrac{2(1-i)}{(1+i)(1-i)}=1-i,  thus, the correct choice is: boxed{text{B}}.

However, 1 leqslant j-i leqslant 5, so (j-i) p is one of the numbers p, 2 p, 3 p, 4 p, 5 p, which, by the condition, should be a six-digit number, leading to a contradiction.Since each leading digit belongs to the set M, these six leading digits exactly form the set M. Thus, the digits of p are all distinct and do not include 0.Similarly, the last digits of these six numbers are also distinct (otherwise, if two numbers i p and j p have the same last digit, then the last digit of their difference is 0, and (j-i) p is one of the numbers p, 2 p, 3 p, 4 p, 5 p, leading to a contradiction).Therefore, the last digit of p must be odd (otherwise, if the last digit of p is even, then the last digit of 5 p is 0, which is a contradiction), and this last digit f neq 5 (otherwise, the last digit of 2 p would be 0, which is a contradiction).Since 6 p is still a six-digit number, we know that the leading digit of p, a=1 (if the leading digit of p, a geqslant 2, then 6 p would be a seven-digit number, contradicting the condition). Hence, f neq 1.Thus, f in {3, 7, 9}.We will discuss each case separately.If f=3, then the last digits of the six numbers p, 2 p, 3 p, 4 p, 5 p, 6 p are 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, respectively, all belonging to the setM={3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8},These six digits should also be the six digits of p, but in this case, S(p) = 33 is not a multiple of 9, leading to a contradiction.If f=9, then the last digits of the six numbers p, 2 p, 3 p, 4 p, 5 p, 6 p are 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, respectively, all belonging to the setM={9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4},These six digits should also be the six digits of p, but in this case, S(p) = 39, which is not a multiple of 9, leading to a contradiction.Therefore, only f=7.Thus, the last digits of the six numbers p, 2 p, 3 p, 4 p, 5 p, 6 p are 7, 4, 1, 8, 5, 2.Hence, the set M={7, 4, 1, 8, 5, 2}.We already have a=1 and f=7, so p=overline{1 b c d e 7}.Thus, b in {2, 4, 5, 8}.The leading digits of p, 2 p, 3 p, 4 p, 5 p, 6 p should be the increasing sequence of numbers in M, i.e., 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8.If b geqslant 5, then the leading digit of 2 p will be greater than 2, leading to a contradiction. Hence, b in {2, 4}.If b=2, then p leqslant 128547, and in this case, the leading digit of 5 p is no more than 6, leading to a contradiction.Thus, only b=4, giving p=overline{14 c d e 7}.Thus, e in {2, 5, 8}.If e=2, i.e., p=overline{14 c d 27}, then the second last digit (tens place) of 4 p is 0, and 0 notin M;If e=8, i.e., p=overline{14 c d 87}, then the second last digit (tens place) of 3 p is 6, and 6 notin M.Therefore, only e=5, giving p=overline{14 c d 57}, where {c, d}={2, 8}. In this case, only p=148257 or p=142857 are possible.If p=148257, then 2 p=296514, and the digits 6, 9 notin M.Thus, the only possible six-digit number p in this problem is p=142857.It is easy to verify that it satisfies the conditions of the problem."},{"problem":"In the Cartesian coordinate plane (xOy), point A is on the ellipse frac{x^{2}}{25}+ frac{y^{2}}{9}=1, and point P satisfies overrightarrow{AP}=(λ-1) overrightarrow{OA}(λ∈R), and overrightarrow{OA}⋅ overrightarrow{OP}=72.

If in addition to adding 5 blue marbles to the bag Luke removes 5 red marbles from the bag, then the total number of marbles in the bag, 2 k+3 k, remains the same.The probability that Luke randomly chooses a blue marble from the bag is determined by dividing the number of blue marbles in the bag, 2 k+5, by the total number of marbles in the bag, 5 k.Thus, frac{2 k+5}{5 k}=frac{3}{5} or 5(2 k+5)=3(5 k).Dividing both sides of this equation by 5 we have, 2 k+5=3 k and so k=5.Therefore, the total number of marbles in the bag is 5 k=5(5)=25.## Solution 2Let the initial number of marbles in the bag be N.Since the probability that Luke randomly chooses a blue marble from the bag is frac{2}{5}, then there are frac{2}{5} N blue marbles initially.When 5 blue marbles are added to the bag and 5 red marbles are removed from the bag, the number of marbles in the bag is still N.Since the probability of choosing a blue marble at the end is frac{3}{5}, then there are frac{3}{5} N blue marbles in the bag at the end.The difference between the number of blue marbles initially and the number of blue marbles at the end is 5 , since 5 blue marbles were added.Thus, frac{3}{5} N-frac{2}{5} N=5 or frac{1}{5} N=5 or N=25.Therefore, the total number of marbles in the bag is 25 .ANSWER: (E)"},{"problem":"1.

The smallest sum of six different natural numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6=21, but this is not divisible by, for example, two or six. The next possibility is to replace the number 6 with 7, making the sum 22. However, 22 is not divisible by, for example, three. The sum 23 cannot work because 23 is a prime number, divisible only by two natural numbers. Finally, the number 24 is the sum of the numbers 1,2,3,4,6, and 8, and 24 is divisible by each of the numbers 1,2,3,4,6,8.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the number of sequences ((T_1, T_2, ldots, T_k)) of subsets (T_i) of ([n]) such that (T_1 subseteq T_2 supseteq T_3 subseteq T_4 supseteq ldots). Here, ([n]) denotes the set ({1, 2, ldots, n}).2. Base Case (n = 1):   For (n = 1), the set ([1] = {1}) has only two subsets: (emptyset) and ({1}). We define:   - (U_k) as the number of sequences of length (k) ending in ({1}).   - (L_k) as the number of sequences of length (k) ending in (emptyset).3. Recurrence Relations:   - If a sequence (S) of length (2j-1) ends in (emptyset), it can be extended in three ways: ({1}, {1}), ({1}, emptyset), or (emptyset, emptyset).   - If (S) ends in ({1}), it can be extended in two ways: ({1}, {1}) or ({1}, emptyset).   From these observations, we derive the following recurrence relations:   [   U_{2j} = U_{2j-1} + L_{2j-1}   ]   [   L_{2j} = L_{2j-1}   ]   [   U_{2j+1} = U_{2j-1} + L_{2j-1}   ]   [   L_{2j+1} = U_{2j-1} + 2L_{2j-1} = U_{2j+1} + L_{2j-1}   ]4.

Specifically:   [   U_1 = 1 = F_1   ]   [   L_1 = 1 = F_2   ]   Thus, the sequence is:   [   U_{2j+1} = F_{2j+1}   ]   [   L_{2j+1} = F_{2j+2}   ]5.

Recall the formula for the surface area of a sphere: S = 4pi r^2, where r is the radius of the sphere. Since the spheres' surface areas are in a 1 : 4 ratio, we can deduce that the radii are also in a 1 : 2 ratio (and not 1 : 4 as given in the provided solution).

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This can be written as a^2 + b^2 = c^2.2. Substituting a = n, b = frac{n^2-1}{2}, and c = frac{n^2+1}{2} into the Pythagorean theorem:[n^2 + left(frac{n^2-1}{2}right)^2 = left(frac{n^2+1}{2}right)^2]3. Simplifying the equation:[n^2 + frac{n^4-2n^2+1}{4} = frac{n^4+2n^2+1}{4}]4. This simplifies to:[frac{4n^2 + n^4 - 2n^2 + 1}{4} = frac{n^4 + 2n^2 + 1}{4}]5. Which further simplifies to:[frac{n^4 + 2n^2 + 1}{4} = frac{n^4 + 2n^2 + 1}{4}]6. This shows that the equation holds true, proving that n, frac{n^2-1}{2}, and frac{n^2+1}{2} form a Pythagorean triple.Therefore, for n = 11, the next two numbers are frac{11^2-1}{2} = 60 and frac{11^2+1}{2} = 61. Hence, the next Pythagorean triple is boxed{11, 60, 61}, and the algebraic expressions for any odd n geqslant 3 that form a Pythagorean triple are boxed{frac{n^2-1}{2}} and boxed{frac{n^2+1}{2}}."},{"problem":"6.

For any prime p and any x, y in mathbb{N}, we have x equiv y(bmod p) if and only if f(x) equiv f(y) (bmod p). Moreover, p mid f(x) if and only if p mid x. Proof. Consider an arbitrary prime p. Since f is surjective, there exists some x in mathbb{N} such that p mid f(x). Let  d=min {x in mathbb{N}: p mid f(x)} .  By induction on k, we obtain that p mid f(k d) for all k in mathbb{N}. The base is true since p mid f(d). Moreover, if p mid f(k d) and p mid f(d) then, by the problem condition, p mid f(k d+d)=f((k+1) d) as required. Suppose that there exists an x in mathbb{N} such that d notmid x but p mid f(x). Let  y=min {x in mathbb{N}: d notmid x, p mid f(x)} .  By the choice of d, we have y>d, and y-d is a positive integer not divisible by d. Then p nmid (y-d), while p mid f(d) and p mid f(d+(y-d))=f(y). This contradicts the problem condition. Hence, there is no such x, and  p mid f(x) Longleftrightarrow d mid x .  Take arbitrary x, y in mathbb{N} such that x equiv y(bmod d). We have p mid f(x+(2 x d-x))=f(2 x d); moreover, since d mid 2 x d+(y-x)=y+(2 x d-x), we get p mid f(y+(2 x d-x)). Then by the problem condition p mid f(x)+f(2 x d-x), p mid f(y)+f(2 x d-x), and hence f(x) equiv -f(2 x d-x) equiv f(y) (bmod p). On the other hand, assume that f(x) equiv f(y)(bmod p). Again we have p mid f(x)+f(2 x d-x) which by our assumption implies that p mid f(x)+f(2 x d-x)+(f(y)-f(x))=f(y)+f(2 x d-x). Hence by the problem condition p mid f(y+(2 x d-x)). Using (1) we get 0 equiv y+(2 x d-x) equiv y-x (bmod d). Thus, we have proved that  x equiv y quad(bmod d) Longleftrightarrow f(x) equiv f(y) quad(bmod p)  We are left to show that p=d : in this case (1) and (2) provide the desired statements. The numbers 1,2, ldots, d have distinct residues modulo d. By (2), numbers f(1), f(2), ldots, f(d) have distinct residues modulo p; hence there are at least d distinct residues, and p geq d. On the other hand, by the surjectivity of f, there exist x_{1}, ldots, x_{p} in mathbb{N} such that fleft(x_{i}right)=i for any i=1,2, ldots, p. By (2), all these x_{i} 's have distinct residues modulo d. For the same reasons, d geq p. Hence, d=p. Now we prove that f(n)=n by induction on n. If n=1 then, by the Lemma, p notmid f(1) for any prime p, so f(1)=1, and the base is established. Suppose that n>1 and denote k=f(n). Note that there exists a prime q mid n, so by the Lemma q mid k and k>1. If k>n then k-n+1>1, and there exists a prime p mid k-n+1; we have k equiv n-1 (bmod p). By the induction hypothesis we have f(n-1)=n-1 equiv k=f(n)(bmod p). Now, by the Lemma we obtain n-1 equiv n(bmod p) which cannot be true. Analogously, if k<n then n-k+1>1, so there exists a prime p mid n-k+1 and n equiv k-1(bmod p). By the Lemma again, k=f(n) equiv f(k-1)=k-1(bmod p), which is also false. The only remaining case is k=n, so f(n)=n. Finally, the function f(n)=n obviously satisfies the condition."},{"problem":"2. The positive integers x and y satisfy the equation y x^{2}+x y^{2}=70.

Descartes: if any of four circles touches the other three, then twice the sum of the squares of their curvatures is equal to the square of the sum of their curvatures.The curvature of a circle with radius r is frac{1}{r}, and the curvature of a line is zero. The theorem is also valid when a line appears instead of one of the circles. From the perspective of its application, the curvatures of circles that touch each other externally have the same sign, and those that touch internally have opposite signs. Its proof can be found on pages 31-32 of H. S. M. Coxeter's book \\"Introduction to Geometry\\". According to the theorem:2left(frac{1}{r^{2}}+frac{1}{R^{2}}+frac{1}{(r+R)^{2}}+frac{1}{x^{2}}right)=left(frac{1}{r}+frac{1}{R}-frac{1}{r+R}+frac{1}{x}right)^{2}Solving this quadratic equation for frac{1}{x}, x can be determined:x=frac{R r(R+r)}{R^{2}+R r+r^{2}}Zsolt Terék (Fazekas M. Főv. Gyak. Gimn., III. o.t.)Remarks. 1. Descartes' theorem mentioned above fell into obscurity over time and was rediscovered by several others, for example, in 1936 by Sir Frederick Soddy, a Nobel laureate in physics, who also showed that an analogous theorem holds for five spheres in space. Soddy wrote a poem titled \\"The Kiss Precise\\" about the theorems, one of whose verses expresses the theorem used in the second solution as follows:Four circles to the kissing come,  The smaller are the bolder some;  The bend is just the inverse of  The distance from the center, of course.  Euclid could not have seen it,  Nor could the compass rule it;  For the straight line does not curve,  And the concave bend is minus,  The sum of the squares of the four bends  Is half the square of their sum.2. Gabriella Zsombori (Csíkszereda, Márton Á. Gimn., IV. o.t.) based her solution on the Stewart theorem. The theorem, with the notations of Figure 2, can be stated as follows: b^{2} p+c^{2} q-a r^{2}=a p q. Its proof can be found on pages 21-22 of H. S. M. Coxeter and S. L. Greitzer's book \\"New Horizons in Geometry\\". Applying the theorem to the triangle O O_{2} O_{3} in Figure 1, we obtain equation (1), from which x can be determined.3. In Ferenc Lobozár's second solution, he chose the point B in Figure 1 as the pole of an inversion. He defined the radius of the inversion circle by the relation d^{2}=B C cdot B A=2 r(2 r+2 R)=4 r(r+R). Thus, the images of the two circles passing through point B became two lines, and he calculated the desired radius based on the significantly simpler figure.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_81590bba0a50f1329fcfg-1.jpg?height=279&width=499&top_left_y=2365&top_left_x=802)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_81590bba0a50f1329fcfg-2.jpg?height=244&width=271&top_left_y=125&top_left_x=908)"},{"problem":"4 cdot 200 A dance party has 42 participants.

Let the origin be denoted as O(0 ; 0), the center of the circle as Q(a ; b) (since it lies on the line y=b, its ordinate is b); the points of intersection of the line with the parabola as Aleft(x_{1} ; y_{1}right) and Bleft(x_{2} ; y_{2}right)left(x_{1}0right). Also, let T(0 ; b) be the point of intersection of the given line with the ordinate axis, and C be the point of intersection of the circle with the ordinate axis, different from O.Triangle Q O C is isosceles (Q O=Q C as radii), and Q T is its height, hence Q T is also a median, C T=O T, so the point C has coordinates (0 ; 2 b). Drop a perpendicular A H from point A to the ordinate axis. Then angle T A H is the angle of inclination of the line, its tangent is frac{3}{4}.

Thus, b^{2}=-frac{25}{16} cdotleft(-frac{4 b}{3}right) Leftrightarrow b^{2}=frac{25 b}{12}, from which b=frac{25}{12}.The value b=0 is not suitable, as in this case the given line takes the form y=frac{3}{4} x, i.e., passes through the origin.For b<0 (naturally, we consider only those b for which the line and the parabola have two points of intersection), both numbers x_{1} and x_{2} are positive.

We start by examining the unit digit of powers of 2013. Notice that the unit digit of 2013 is 3, so we only need to consider the unit digit of powers of 3.   Let's find the unit digits of the first few powers of 3:   [   begin{align*}   3^1 & = 3 quad (text{unit digit is } 3)    3^2 & = 9 quad (text{unit digit is } 9)    3^3 & = 27 quad (text{unit digit is } 7)    3^4 & = 81 quad (text{unit digit is } 1)    3^5 & = 243 quad (text{unit digit is } 3)    end{align*}   ]   We observe that the unit digits repeat every 4 terms: 3, 9, 7, 1. This is a cyclic pattern with a period of 4.   To determine the unit digit of (2013^k), we need to find the remainder when (k) is divided by 4:   [   k mod 4   ]   For (k = 1, 2, 3, ldots, 2013), we have:   [   begin{align*}   2013 mod 4 & = 1 quad (text{since } 2013 = 4 times 503 + 1)   end{align*}   ]   Therefore, the unit digit of (2013^k) for (k equiv 1 mod 4) is 3.   Now, we sum the unit digits of the terms:   [   3 + 9 + 7 + 1 + 3 + 9 + 7 + 1 + ldots + 3   ]   Since the pattern repeats every 4 terms, we can group the terms into sets of 4:   [   (3 + 9 + 7 + 1) + (3 + 9 + 7 + 1) + ldots + 3   ]   Each group of 4 terms sums to:   [   3 + 9 + 7 + 1 = 20   ]   There are (2013 div 4 = 503) complete groups of 4 terms, plus 1 extra term (since (2013 mod 4 = 1)).   The sum of the unit digits of the complete groups is:   [   503 times 20 = 10060   ]   Adding the unit digit of the extra term:   [   10060 + 3 = 10063   ]   The unit digit of 10063 is 3.   Therefore, the unit digit of the sum (2013^1 + 2013^2 + 2013^3 + ldots + 2013^{2012} + 2013^{2013}) is:   [   boxed{3}   ]"},{"problem":"Example 1.

Therefore, we also have a_{n+1}a_{n+2}+1 = tS_{n+1}.Subtracting these two equations, we obtain:[ a_{n+1}(a_{n+2} - a_n) = t(a_{n+1}) ]Since a_n is an arithmetic sequence, a_{n+2} - a_n = 2d, giving us the relationship:[ a_{n+1}(2d) = t(a_{n+1}) ]Setting n=1, we have:[ 2(a_1a_2+1) = t(1+a_1) ]Given that a_1 = 1, we can find a_2:[ 2(a_2+1) = t(2) Rightarrow a_2 = t-1 ]Again, since it's an arithmetic sequence with the common difference d, we get a_3 = a_2 + d = t + 1 - d. However, we also have a_3 = a_1 + 2d = 1 + 2d, equating the two expressions for a_3, we have:[ t + 1 - d = 1 + 2d Rightarrow t = 3d + 1 ]From our previous deduction with n=1, and knowing that a_2 = t - 1, we substitute a_2 = d and get:[ 2(d + 1) = (3d+1)(2) ]Solving the equation yields:[ 2d + 2 = 6d + 2 Rightarrow 4d = 0 ]This implies that d = 0, but given that the common difference d must be a positive number, we must have made an error.Let's correct our approach. Using a_1 = 1, we have:[ 2(a_1a_2+1) = t(1+a_1) Rightarrow 2(1cdot a_2+1) = t(1+1) Rightarrow 2a_2 + 2 = 2t Rightarrow a_2 = t - 1 ]Since a_{n+2} - a_n=2d, and we have a_2 as t-1, it means that 2d = d, as this is true for all terms in the arithmetic sequence. This means d must equal to t due to the structure of the sequence that involves all terms a_n, a_{n+1}, a_{n+2} continuously. Now evaluating the sum to the first term:[ begin{align*}2(a_1 cdot a_2 + 1) & = t(1 + a_1), 2(1 cdot (t - 1) + 1) & = t(1 + 1), 2t & = 2t,end{align*} ]This is an identity, given that for any t the equation holds true.From this we can see that we actually don't need the identity t = 3d + 1. We already have enough information to find all terms. If we rethink the logic, considering a_3 = a_2 + d = (t-1) + d and a_3 = a_1 + 2d = 1 + 2d, we equate these:[ t - 1 + d = 1 + 2d Rightarrow t = 2d + 2. ]Since we have an arithmetic sequence, by setting n = 1 in the original equation, we get a_2 = t - 1. Now we must find t.

Recursive Step:   - For ( n > 1 ), we need to consider the different ways to parenthesize the product and the different orders in which the numbers can be multiplied.   - The number of ways to parenthesize ( n ) numbers is given by the ((n-1))-th Catalan number, ( C_{n-1} ). The Catalan number ( C_k ) is given by:     [     C_k = frac{1}{k+1} binom{2k}{k}     ]   - For each parenthesization, there are ( n! ) ways to order the ( n ) numbers.3.

For example, (2 cdot p_1) and (2 cdot p_2) share the common factor 2, (3 cdot p_1) and (3 cdot p_2) share the common factor 3, and so on.5. Include numbers that are the product of three or more primes:   For numbers that are the product of three or more primes, say (alpha = beta cdot gamma cdot delta) (where (beta, gamma, delta) are primes and (beta leq gamma leq delta)), we can place (alpha) next to (beta cdot gamma). This ensures that (alpha) and (beta cdot gamma) share the common factor (beta cdot gamma), and thus are not coprime.6. Complete the arrangement:   By continuing this process, we can arrange all composite numbers up to (10^6) on a circle such that no two neighboring numbers are coprime.[boxed{text{It is possible to arrange all composite positive integers not exceeding } 10^6 text{ on a circle so that no two neighboring numbers are coprime.}}]"},{"problem":"Point C lies on segment AB, and |overrightarrow{AC}|=frac{2}{3}|overrightarrow{CB}|.

We are also given that overrightarrow{AB}=λoverrightarrow{BC}. We need to find the value of lambda.1. Start with the relationship overrightarrow{AB} = overrightarrow{AC} + overrightarrow{CB}. Since overrightarrow{AB}=λoverrightarrow{BC}, we can substitute to get:[λoverrightarrow{BC} = overrightarrow{AC} + overrightarrow{CB}]2. Rearranging the equation, we find an expression for overrightarrow{AC} in terms of overrightarrow{CB}:[overrightarrow{AC} = (-λ - 1)overrightarrow{CB}]3. We know that |overrightarrow{AC}| = frac{2}{3}|overrightarrow{CB}|. Substituting the expression for overrightarrow{AC} from step 2, we get:[|(-λ - 1)overrightarrow{CB}| = frac{2}{3}|overrightarrow{CB}|]4. Simplifying, we find that the magnitude of λ + 1 times the magnitude of overrightarrow{CB} equals frac{2}{3} times the magnitude of overrightarrow{CB}:[|λ + 1||overrightarrow{CB}| = frac{2}{3}|overrightarrow{CB}|]5. Since |overrightarrow{CB}| is not zero (because C lies on segment AB and thus overrightarrow{CB} is not the zero vector), we can divide both sides by |overrightarrow{CB}| to get:[|λ + 1| = frac{2}{3}]6. Solving the equation |λ + 1| = frac{2}{3} gives us two possible values for λ:[λ + 1 = frac{2}{3} quad text{or} quad λ + 1 = -frac{2}{3}]7.

Determining if f(x) is an increasing function for a leqslant 0:   We find the derivative of f(x):   [   f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(e^{x} - ax) = e^{x} - a.   ]   For a leqslant 0, we have:   [   f'(x) = e^{x} - a > e^{x} - 0 = e^{x} > 0.   ]   Since e^{x} > 0 for all x, and subtracting a non-positive number (a leqslant 0) makes the expression strictly positive, f'(x) > 0 for all x. This implies that f(x) is an increasing function for a leqslant 0. Therefore, option boxed{A} is correct.2. Finding the extremum point when a = 1:   Setting a = 1, we calculate the derivative:   [   f'(x) = e^{x} - 1.   ]   Setting f'(x) = 0 to find critical points:   [   e^{x} - 1 = 0 implies e^{x} = 1 implies x = 0.   ]   To determine the nature of the critical point at x = 0, we examine the sign of f'(x):   - For x  0, e^{x} > 1 implies f'(x) > 0.   This indicates a transition from decreasing to increasing at x = 0, hence an extremum point, specifically a minimum, exists at x = 0. Therefore, option boxed{C} is correct.3. Analyzing the function for a > 0 and finding f(x)_{min}:   For a > 0, the derivative f'(x) = e^{x} - a changes sign based on the value of x:   - When x  ln a, e^{x} > a implies f'(x) > 0.   This indicates that f(x) is decreasing on (-infty, ln a) and increasing on (ln a, +infty), with a minimum at x = ln a. Calculating f(x)_{min}:   [   f(x)_{min} = f(ln a) = e^{ln a} - aln a = a - aln a.   ]   Specifically, when a = 1, f(x)_{min} = 1 - 1ln 1 = 1 - 0 = 1. However, this does not imply that f(x)_{min} = a for all a > 0, as the expression for f(x)_{min} includes a term -aln a which varies with a.

Initial Setup and Strategy:   - Given a triangle (ABC) with area 1.   - Anja and Bernd play a game where Anja chooses a point (X) on side (BC), Bernd chooses a point (Y) on side (CA), and Anja chooses a point (Z) on side (AB).   - Anja aims to maximize the area of triangle (XYZ), while Bernd aims to minimize it.2. Analyzing Bernd's Strategy:   - Suppose Bernd chooses (Y) such that (XY) is parallel to (AB).   - Let (frac{BX}{BC} = k). By similar triangles, the ratio of the height from (Z) to (XY) to the height from (C) to (AB) is also (k), and the ratio (frac{XY}{AB} = 1 - k).   - Therefore, the ratio (frac{[XYZ]}{[ABC]} = k(1 - k)), which means ([XYZ] = k(1 - k)).3. Maximizing the Area:   - The function (k(1 - k)) is a quadratic function that reaches its maximum value when (k = frac{1}{2}).   - Substituting (k = frac{1}{2}), we get ([XYZ] = frac{1}{2} cdot left(1 - frac{1}{2}right) = frac{1}{4}).   - Thus, the maximum area Anja can achieve is (frac{1}{4}) if Bernd plays optimally.4. Optimal Play by Anja:   - Suppose Anja chooses (X) to be the midpoint of (BC), i.e., (k = frac{1}{2}).   - If Bernd chooses (Y) closer to (C) than (A), Anja should choose (Z = A). This creates a triangle with area greater than (frac{1}{4}) since the height from (X) to (YZ) is exactly half of the height from (B) to (AC) and also (YZ > frac{AC}{2}).   - If Bernd chooses (Y) closer to (A) than (C), Anja should choose (Z = B). This also creates a triangle with area greater than (frac{1}{4}) since (XZ) is exactly half of (BC) but the height from (Y) to (BC) is more than half of the height from (A) to (BC).5. Bernd's Optimal Response:   - To minimize the area, Bernd should choose (Y) to be the midpoint of (AC), which forces the triangle to have area (frac{1}{4}) regardless of (Z), since (XY) is parallel to (AB).Conclusion:[boxed{frac{1}{4}}]"},{"problem":"9.

Let n be a positive integer. There are n boxes, each containing some crystal balls (empty boxes are allowed). In each operation, you are allowed to select a box, take out two crystal balls from it, discard one, and place the other in another selected box. For a certain initial distribution of crystal balls, if after a finite number of operations (which could be 0) there are no empty boxes, then this initial distribution is called \\"solvable.\\" Find all such initial distributions that are not solvable, but become solvable if one more crystal ball is added to any box.","solution":"5. The desired distribution is: there are a total of 2 n-2 crystal balls in all the boxes, and the number of crystal balls in each box is even.Number the boxes from 1 sim n, and use the arrayx=left(x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{n}right)to represent a distribution state, where x_{i}(i=1,2, cdots, n) represents the number of crystal balls in the i-th box. For the distribution x, defineD(x)=sum_{i=1}^{n}left[frac{x_{i}-1}{2}right] text {, }where [x] denotes the greatest integer not exceeding the real number x.Equation (1) can be rewritten asD(x)=frac{1}{2} N(x)-n+frac{1}{2} O(x),where N(x) represents the total number of balls in all the boxes in the distribution x, and O(x) represents the number of boxes in the distribution x that contain an odd number of balls.Notice that each operation either leaves the value of D(x) unchanged (if the operation is performed on a box with an odd number of crystal balls) or decreases the value of D(x) by 1 (if the operation is performed on a box with an even number of crystal balls). For any distribution without empty boxes, D(x) is non-negative, and similarly, for any solvable distribution, D(x) is also non-negative.On the other hand, for a distribution x where D(x) is non-negative, D(x) geqslant 0 indicates thatsum_{m_{i}>0} m_{i}left(m_{i}=left[frac{x_{i}-1}{2}right]right)is not less than the number of empty boxes. For each i satisfying m_{i}>0, m_{i} steps can be performed to move the balls from the i-th box to m_{i} empty boxes, thus ensuring that all boxes contain at least one ball.Since N(x) and O(x) have the same parity, a distribution x is solvable if and only if O(x) geqslant 2 n-N(x); and a distribution x is unsolvable if and only if O(x) leqslant 2 n-2-N(x). In particular, any distribution with a total of 2 n-1 balls is solvable, and any distribution with a total of 2 n-2 balls is unsolvable if and only if all the boxes contain an even number of balls.Let x^{prime} be the distribution obtained by adding one ball to a box in the distribution x.

For the complement graph ( G^C ), adding ( v ) can increase the chromatic number by at most 1. Therefore, ( chi(G^C) leq chi(G_0^C) + 1 ).     Using the inductive hypothesis:     [     chi(G) + chi(G^C) leq chi(G_0) + chi(G_0^C) + 1 leq (k + 1) + 1 = k + 2     ]   - Case 2:     Suppose for every vertex ( v ) in ( G ), ( deg(v) geq chi(G) - 1 ). This implies ( Delta(G^C) leq k + 1 - chi(G) ).     Using the fact that ( chi(G) leq Delta(G) + 1 ) and ( chi(G^C) leq Delta(G^C) + 1 ):     [     chi(G^C) leq k + 2 - chi(G)     ]     Therefore:     [     chi(G) + chi(G^C) leq chi(G) + (k + 2 - chi(G)) = k + 2     ]4. Conclusion:   By induction, we have shown that for any graph ( G ) with ( n ) vertices, ( chi(G) + chi(G^C) leq n + 1 ).5. Maximum Value:   The maximum value is achieved when ( G ) is a complete graph ( K_n ). In this case, ( chi(G) = n ) and ( chi(G^C) = 1 ), giving:   [   chi(G) + chi(G^C) = n + 1   ]The final answer is ( boxed{ n + 1 } )."},{"problem":"Four students take an exam.

Consequently, we have sin(angle AOB) = 1.This implies that angle AOB = 90°, which means that OA perp OB. The distance d from the center of the circle to the line is d= frac{1}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}. Given that the area of triangle AOB is frac{1}{2}, we must have d=frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.Hence, we find that a^2 + b^2 = 2. To find the maximum value of a + b, we use the fact that (a+b)^2 leq 2(a^2 + b^2) based on the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. This gives us (a+b)^2 leq 4, or a + b leq 2. Therefore, the maximum value of a+b is boxed{2}.To summarize, using the area of triangle AOB to conclude that OA perp OB, we found the distance between the circle's center and the line.

We would have a-b=2 and a^{3}-b^{3}=31106. Using difference of cubes, we would have (a-b)(a^{2}+ab+b^{2})=31106. Since we know a-b is equal to 2, (a-b)(a^{2}+ab+b^{2}) would become 2(a^{2}+ab+b^{2})=31106. Simplifying more, we would get a^{2}+ab+b^{2}=15553.Now let's introduce another variable. Instead of using a and b, we can express the primes as x+2 and x where a is x+2 and b is x. Plugging x and x+2 in, we would have (x+2)^{2}+x(x+2)+x^{2}. When we expand the parenthesis, it would become x^{2}+4x+4+x^{2}+2x+x^{2}. Then we combine like terms to get 3x^{2}+6x+4 which equals 15553. Then we subtract 4 from both sides to get 3x^{2}+6x=15549. Since all three numbers are divisible by 3, we can divide by 3 to get x^{2}+2x=5183.Notice how if we add 1 to both sides, the left side would become a perfect square trinomial: x^{2}+2x+1=5184 which is (x+1)^{2}=5184. Since 2 is too small to be a valid number, the two primes must be odd, therefore x+1 is the number in the middle of them. Conveniently enough, 5184=72^{2} so the two numbers are 71 and 73.

We know that 70^{2} = 4900, and we notice that for x^{2}+2x=5183, x must be a odd number. Thus we can guess that x=71, which proves to be right. Continuing, we then know the larger prime is 73, and we know that 75 and 77 aren't primes, so thus our next bigger prime is 79, and 7+9=16.

The volume of a cone is given by frac 13 Bh; since both cones share the same base, then the desired volume is frac 13 cdot pi r^2 cdot (h_1 + h_2). The [distance](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Distance) from the point (8,10) to the line x - 3y + 15 = 0 is given by left|frac{(8) - 3(10) + 15}{sqrt{1^2 + (-3)^2}}right| = frac{7}{sqrt{10}}. The distance between left(frac 92, frac {13}2right) and left(frac{39}{4}, frac{33}{4}right) is given by h_1 + h_2 = sqrt{left(frac{18}{4} - frac{39}{4}right)^2 + left(frac{26}{4} - frac{33}{4}right)^2} = frac{7sqrt{10}}{4}.

It competes in a 100-meter race to the edge of a cliff. How many jumps must the cricket make to reach the end of the race without going past the finish line and falling off the cliff?#","solution":"SolutionFirst solution: Suppose the cricket only jumps 9 meters. On its twelfth jump, it would fall off the cliff, since 9 cdot 12 = 108 , text{m}. Since it can also jump 8 meters, it is enough to \\"exchange\\" 8 jumps of 9 meters for jumps of 8 meters. Thus, we have 4 jumps of 9 meters and 8 jumps of 8 meters, for a total of 4 + 8 = 12 jumps.This is the only combination of jumps possible, because if the cricket makes fewer than 4 jumps of 9 meters, the maximum distances it can travel without falling off the cliff are: 3 cdot 9 + 9 cdot 8 = 99 , text{m}, 2 cdot 9 + 10 cdot 8 = 98 , text{m}, 1 cdot 9 + 11 cdot 8 = 97 , text{m}, text{and} 0 cdot 9 + 12 cdot 8 = 96 , text{m}. Furthermore, if the cricket makes more than 4 jumps of 9 meters, it must make fewer than 8 jumps of 8 meters, and thus the maximum distances it can travel without falling off the cliff are: 5 cdot 9 + 6 cdot 8 = 93 , text{m}, 6 cdot 9 + 5 cdot 8 = 94 , text{m}, 7 cdot 9 + 4 cdot 8 = 95 , text{m}, 8 cdot 9 + 3 cdot 8 = 96 , text{m}, 9 cdot 9 + 2 cdot 8 = 97 , text{m}, 10 cdot 9 + 1 cdot 8 = 98 , text{m}, text{and} 11 cdot 9 + 0 cdot 8 = 99 , text{m}. Since none of these distances equal 100, there is no other combination.Second solution: Let x be the number of 9-meter jumps and y be the number of 8-meter jumps. We want to determine x + y, knowing that:begin{aligned}100 & = 9x + 8y & = 8(x + y) + xend{aligned}Since 100 leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8, the same must be true for the number 8(x + y) + x. That is, x must leave a remainder of 4 when divided by 8, since 8(x + y) is already a multiple of 8. If x > 4, we know that x is at least 8 cdot 1 + 4 = 12, which is the next number that leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8 after 4. If the cricket makes 12 jumps of 9 , text{m}, it will reach 9 cdot 12 = 108 , text{m} and fall off the cliff. Therefore, x = 4, and after substituting x into the equation above, we can conclude that y = (100 - 9 cdot 4) / 8 = 8.

Therefore, 11 is a harmonious number;Similarly to (2), we can prove that 5 and 10 are harmonious numbers;Similarly to (3), we can prove that 9 is a harmonious number;Since 2 and 3 are harmonious numbers, we can prove that 6 is a harmonious number;Since 3 and 5; 2, 3, and 11; 9 and 10 are harmonious numbers, we can prove that 15, 66, and 90 are harmonious numbers.In addition, it can be calculated that 4, 7, 8, and 12 are not harmonious numbers.Thus, there are 11 harmonious numbers among the above numbers.Therefore, the answer is (D)."},{"problem":"The famous mathematician Hu Luogeng once said: \\"The combination of shape and number is good in a hundred ways, and the division and separation is stopped in ten thousand things.\\" In fact, many algebraic problems can be transformed into geometric problems for solving. For example, sqrt{(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2} can be transformed into the distance between point M(x,y) and point N(a,b) on the plane. Based on the above perspective, find the minimum value of f(x)=sqrt{x^2+4x+20}+sqrt{x^2+2x+10}.","solution":"This problem involves the formula for the distance between two points. The function f(x)=sqrt{x^2+4x+20}+sqrt{x^2+2x+10}=sqrt{(x+2)^2+(0-4)^2}+sqrt{(x+1)^2+(0+3)^2} represents the sum of the distances between the point M(x,0) and the points N(-2,4) and O(-1,-3) on the plane. By using the distance formula, we can find the minimum value of f(x).First, let's find the coordinates of the point M that minimize the sum of its distances to points N and O. We can do this by finding the point where the derivative of f(x) is equal to zero.The derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:f'(x)=frac{x+2}{sqrt{(x+2)^2+16}}+frac{x+1}{sqrt{(x+1)^2+9}}Setting f'(x)=0 and solving for x, we get:frac{x+2}{sqrt{(x+2)^2+16}}=-frac{x+1}{sqrt{(x+1)^2+9}}Squaring both sides and simplifying, we find that x=-3.Now, let's verify that this value of x indeed gives us the minimum value of f(x). We can do this by checking the values of f(x) at the endpoints of its domain (which in this case is all real numbers) and comparing them to f(-3). As x approaches positive or negative infinity, f(x) also approaches infinity. Therefore, the minimum value of f(x) must occur at a critical point, which we have found to be x=-3.Thus, the minimum value of f(x) is:f(-3)=sqrt{(-3+2)^2+(0-4)^2}+sqrt{(-3+1)^2+(0+3)^2}=boxed{5sqrt{2}}"},{"problem":"Given positive numbers a, b, c satisfying 4a-2b+25c=0, the maximum value of lg a+lg c-2lg b is (　).A: -2B: 2C: -1D: 1","solution":"From the given condition: 4a-2b+25c=0, we can transform it into: 4a+25c=2b,Since 4a+25c geqslant 2 sqrt{100ac}, equality holds if and only if 4a=25c.Therefore, 2b geqslant 2 sqrt{100ac}; that is, b^{2} geqslant 100acThus: lg a+lg c-2lg b=lg frac{ac}{b^{2}} leqslant lg frac{ac}{100ac}=lg 10^{-2}=-2Hence, the correct choice is: boxed{A}.By transforming 4a-2b+25c=0 into 4a+25c=2b and using the basic inequality, we can obtain 2b geqslant 2 sqrt{100ac}; lg a+lg c-2lg b=lg frac{ac}{b^{2}} leqslant lg frac{ac}{100ac} to solve the problem.This question tests the ability to manipulate logarithms and apply basic inequalities.

Determine the largest integer k such that we can always color k columns red while still no two rows have the same pattern.","solution":"1. Base Case:   - Consider the smallest case where ( n = 1 ). Since ( m leq n ), we must have ( m = 1 ) as well. In this scenario, we have a ( 1 times 1 ) chessboard with only one column. Clearly, we can color this single column red, satisfying the condition that no two rows have the same pattern (since there is only one row). This establishes the base case.2. Inductive Step:   - Assume the statement is true for an ( m times (n-1) ) chessboard, i.e., we can always color ( (n-1) - m + 1 = n - m ) columns red while ensuring no two rows have the same pattern.   - Now consider an ( m times n ) chessboard ( B ). We need to show that we can color ( n - m + 1 ) columns red.3. Case 1:   - Suppose there exist two rows in ( B ) that are identical except for one column. This column cannot be colored red because doing so would make the two rows identical.    - Erase this column and remove one of the two identical rows. If removing this column causes any other pairs of rows to become identical, remove one row from each such pair as well. This results in a new board with ( n-1 ) columns and at most ( m-1 ) rows.   - By the induction hypothesis, we can color ( (n-1) - (m-1) + 1 = n - m + 1 ) columns red in this reduced board. These same columns can be colored red in the original board ( B ), satisfying the condition.4. Case 2:   - Suppose any pair of rows in ( B ) differs in at least two columns. This means we can color any single column red without making any two rows identical.   - Choose one column arbitrarily and color it red. The remaining board now has dimensions ( m times (n-1) ).   - If ( m leq n-1 ), by the induction hypothesis, we can color ( (n-1) - m + 1 = n - m ) more columns red, making a total of ( n - m + 1 ) red columns.   - If ( m = n ), we only need to color one column red, which we have already done.5. Optimality:   - To show that ( n - m + 1 ) is the best possible, consider a board where the black squares are those whose row index is greater than the column index (i.e., all squares below a 45-degree diagonal line from a corner).   - In this configuration, shading any of the first ( m-1 ) columns would make two rows identical. Therefore, at most ( n - (m-1) = n - m + 1 ) columns can be shaded red.Thus, we have shown both that it is possible to color ( n - m + 1 ) columns red and that this is the maximum number of columns that can be colored red while ensuring no two rows have the same pattern.The final answer is ( boxed{ n - m + 1 } )."},{"problem":"25.

Substituting into (1) yieldsn leqslant frac{sqrt{y^{3}+z^{3}}}{y^{2} z^{2}}+frac{y}{y^{2} z^{2}}+frac{z}{y^{2} z^{2}}=sqrt{frac{1}{y^{1} z}+frac{1}{y z^{4}}}+frac{1}{y z^{2}}+frac{1}{y^{2} z} .(1) When z geqslant 2, since y geqslant z, from (3) we get n leqslant frac{1}{2}, which contradicts n being a positive integer!(2) When z=1, we get y geqslant z=1;(i) If y=1, from x^{2} leqslant y^{3}+z^{3}=2, we get x=1, in which case n=3, and the solution to the equation is (x, y, z)=(1,1,1).(ii) If y geqslant 2, and z=1, from (3) we get n leqslant frac{3}{2}, so n can only be 1. The original equation transforms to: x^{3}+y^{3}+1=x^{2} y^{2}. In this case, the positive integer solution is (x, y, z)=(3,2,1).In summary, the value of n is 1 or 3."},{"problem":"## Task 2If you double a number and then add 20, you get 26.What is the number?","solution":"The number is 3, because 3+3+20=26."},{"problem":"8.

Here, ( a(k) ) is defined as the largest integer such that ( 2^{a(k)} ) divides ( k ).1. Understanding ( a(k) ):   - For any positive integer ( k ), ( a(k) ) is the exponent of the highest power of 2 that divides ( k ). This is equivalent to the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of ( k ).2. Summing ( a(k) ) for ( k = 1 ) to ( 2^n ):   - We need to find the sum ( a(1) + a(2) + cdots + a(2^n) ).3.

We need to show ( S(k+1) = 2^{k+1} - 1 ).     - Consider the sum ( a(1) + a(2) + cdots + a(2^{k+1}) ).     - This can be split into two parts: ( a(1) + a(2) + cdots + a(2^k) ) and ( a(2^k+1) + a(2^k+2) + cdots + a(2^{k+1}) ).     - By the inductive hypothesis, the first part sums to ( 2^k - 1 ).     - For the second part, each ( a(2^k + j) ) is ( a(j) + 1 ) for ( j = 1, 2, ldots, 2^k ).     - Therefore, the second part sums to ( (a(1) + 1) + (a(2) + 1) + cdots + (a(2^k) + 1) = (a(1) + a(2) + cdots + a(2^k)) + 2^k = (2^k - 1) + 2^k = 2^{k+1} - 1 ).Thus, by induction, the sum ( a(1) + a(2) + cdots + a(2^n) = 2^n - 1 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ 2^n - 1 } )."},{"problem":"For a single-story apartment, we know the following: a) there is at most 1 door between any two rooms; b) from any room, there is at most 1 door leading outside the apartment; c) there are 12 doors in the apartment.

To find out how many exercise books can be bought with 24 yuan at most, we establish equations based on the equal relationships described in the problem for both store A and store B.

A positive integer is divisible by 11 exactly when the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11. For example, 63195 is divisible by 11 since the alternating sum of its digits is equal to 0 , and 0 is divisible by 11.

Similarly, taking the 3 digits which contribute negatively to S (there are always 3 ), we let N=b+d+f.Thus, it follows that S=(a+c+e+g)-(b+d+f)=P-N.We determine the largest possible value of S by choosing the 4 largest integers, 4,5,6,7 (in any order), to make up P, and choosing the 3 smallest integers, 1,2,3 (in any order), to make up N.That is, the largest possible alternating sum is S=(4+5+6+7)-(1+2+3)=16.We determine the smallest possible value of S by choosing the 4 smallest integers, 1, 2, 3, 4 (in any order), to make up P, and choosing the 3 largest integers, 5,6,7 (in any order), to make up N.That is, the smallest possible alternating sum is S=(1+2+3+4)-(5+6+7)=-8.Since S must be divisible by 11 (with S geq-8 and S leq 16 ), then either S=11 or S=0.The sum of the first 7 positive integers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7=28, and since each of these 7 integers must contribute to either P or to N, then P+N=28.Case 1: The alternating sum of the digits is 11 , or S=11If S=11, then S=P-N=11. If P-N is 11 (an odd number), then either P is an even number and N is odd, or the opposite is true (they can't both be odd and they can't both be even).That is, the difference between two integers is odd only if one of the integers is even and the other is odd (we say that P and N have different parity).However, if one of P or N is even and the other is odd, then their sum P+N is also odd.But we know that P+N=28, an even number.Therefore, it is not possible that S=11.There are no 7-digit integers formed from the integers 1 through 7 that have an alternating digit sum of 11 and are divisible by 11 .Case 2: The alternating sum of the digits is 0 , or S=0If S=0, then S=P-N=0 and so P=N.Since P+N=28, then P=N=14.We find all groups of 3 digits, chosen from the digits 1 to 7 , such that their sum N=14.There are exactly 4 possibilities: (7,6,1),(7,5,2),(7,4,3), and (6,5,3).In each of these 4 cases, the digits from 1 to 7 that were not chosen, (2,3,4,5),(1,3,4,6),(1,2,5,6), and (1,2,4,7), respectively, represent the 4 digits whose sum is P=14.We summarize this in the table below.| 4 digits whose  sum is P=14 | 3 digits whose  sum is N=14 | 2 examples of 7-digit  integers created from these || :---: | :---: | :---: || 2,3,4,5 | 7,6,1 | 2736415,3126475 || 1,3,4,6 | 7,5,2 | 1735426,6745321 || 1,2,5,6 | 7,4,3 | 2714536,5763241 || 1,2,4,7 | 6,5,3 | 4615237,7645231 |Consider the first row of numbers in this table above.Each arrangement of the 4 digits 2, 3,4, 5 combined with each arrangement of the 3 digits 7,6, 1 (in the required way) gives a new 7 -digit integer whose alternating digit sum is 0 .Two such arrangements are shown (you may check that S=0 for each).Since there are 4 times 3 times 2 times 1=24 ways to arrange the 4 digits ( 4 choices for the first digit, 3 choices for the second, 2 choices for the third and 1 choice for the last digit), and 3 times 2 times 1=6 ways to arrange the 3 digits, then there are 24 times 6=144 ways to arrange the 4 digits and the 3 digits.Each of these 144 arrangements is different from the others, and since P=N=14 for each, then S=P-N=0 and so each of the 144 7-digit numbers is divisible by 11 .Similarly, there are also 144 arrangements that can be formed with each of the other 3 groups of integers that are shown in the final 3 rows of the table.That is, there are a total of 144 times 4=5767-digit integers (formed from the integers 1 through 7) which are divisible by 11 .The total number of 7 -digit integers that can be formed from the integers 1 through 7 is equal to the total number of arrangements of the integers 1 through 7 , or 7 times 6 times 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1=5040.

Method 2: Since the graph of the exponential function y=2^x is shifted 2 units to the left,  and then 1 unit up, to get the function y=2^{x+2}+1.

However, this depends on the value of c. If c = 0, then ac = bc = 0, which does not satisfy the inequality ac > bc. Therefore, option B is also not correct.- For option C, the statement ac^{2} > bc^{2} is similar to option B in that it depends on the value of c. Using the same logic, if c = 0, then ac^{2} = bc^{2} = 0. Thus, the inequality ac^{2} > bc^{2} does not hold, making option C incorrect as well.- Option D asserts a - c > b - c.

We can adopt a generalization strategy, which involves first generalizing the analytical expression that satisfies condition (2), i.e., temporarily ignoring whether this expression meets condition (1).An analytical expression that satisfies condition (2) is easily found, for example,P(x)=frac{x}{x+1} .The advantage of (1) is that it satisfies condition (2); for k=0,1, cdots, n, P(k)=frac{k}{k+1}. The disadvantage is that it does not satisfy condition (1), as it is not a polynomial, let alone an n-degree polynomial.To address this, we further generalize by adding an n+1-degree polynomial Q(x) to the numerator of (1). This way, the numerator becomes an n+1-degree polynomial, and the denominator remains a first-degree polynomial, bringing us closer to an n-degree polynomial, i.e., setP(x)=frac{Q(x)+x}{x+1},where Q(x) is an n+1-degree polynomial.To ensure that (2) satisfies condition (2), Q(x) must be zero when x=0,1, cdots, n.Thus, we can naturally set Q(x) asQ(x)=a x(x-1)(x-2) cdots(x-n) .(a neq 0)This is an n+1-degree polynomial.Thus, the problem is reduced to making the polynomialT(x)=Q(x)+xdivisible by x+1.Therefore, T(x) must have the factor x+1, which meansbegin{array}{c}T(-1)=0 .

Since this triangle is acute-angled (angle ABD = angle CBD < 90^circ, left.angle BAD = angle ADB = frac{180^circ - angle ABD}{2} < 90^circright), point H lies on the segment AB.Notice that the right triangles BDH and BDC are equal by the common hypotenuse BD and the acute angle at vertex B.

The profit per item after the price reduction would be (40 - m - 25) yuan, since the cost price is 25 yuan and the original selling price is 40 yuan. The monthly sales volume after the price reduction becomes (400 + 5m) items.To earn 4250 yuan per month, the equation is:(40 - m - 25)(400 + 5m) = 4250Simplifying, we get:begin{align*}(15 - m)(400 + 5m) &= 4250 6000 + 75m - 400m - 5m^2 &= 4250 -5m^2 - 325m + 1750 &= 0 5m^2 + 325m - 1750 &= 0 end{align*}Solving this quadratic equation, we find:m_1 = 5, quad m_2 = -70Since a negative price reduction is not feasible, we discard m_2 = -70.

Therefore, their arrangement with the largest indicated sum exists (possibly not unique).Let the cards lie in such a way that this sum is maximal. Without loss of generality, we can assume that the top card is white. Then, in this arrangement, pairs of cards CB, BK, and WB cannot lie consecutively from top to bottom, otherwise, the sum can be increased by swapping them in such pairs (symmetric pairs do not increase the desired sum when swapped). Therefore, the cards must lie as follows (from top to bottom): WW...WBB...BBKK...KKWW...W...The length of each subsequent series of cards of the same color cannot be less than the length of the previous series. Indeed, if, for example, in the arrangement with the largest sum, there is a fragment ...WWWBBK..., then the K card can be moved to the top: ...KWWWBB..., increasing the sum. Since the number of cards of each color is the same, the lengths of all series must be the same (otherwise, there will be more cards of the color that ends up at the bottom than cards of another color). Then the series of the same color can be rearranged \\"in a cycle,\\" without changing the sum, that is, to get such an arrangement of cards: 100 white cards on top, 100 black cards below them, and 100 red cards at the bottom. Therefore, the desired sum is 100 cdot 100 + 100 cdot 100 = 20000.Second method. Let the number of cards of each of the three colors be n. Using the method of mathematical induction, we will prove that for the specified sum S, the inequality S leq 2 n^{2} holds.Base of induction. For n=1, by enumeration, we verify that S leq 2. Induction step: Suppose the inequality is true for n cards of each color. We will prove that it is true if the number of cards of each color is n+1. Consider how the sum S can increase if one card of each color is added. Without loss of generality, we can assume that the white card is added to the very top of the stack, and the added black and red cards are the topmost among the cards of their color. Let there be b previously lying black cards above the first red card from the top, and w previously lying white cards above the first black card from the top. Then the white card adds n+1 to the sum (considering all black cards lying below it), the black card adds n+1 (considering all red cards lying below it) and w, due to it lying below w old white cards, and the red card adds no more than n-w due to white cards lying below it and b due to it lying below b old black cards. In total, S leq 2 n^{2} + n + 1 + n + 1 + w + n - w + b = 2 n^{2} + 3 n + b + 2. Considering that b leq n, we get: S leq 2 n^{2} + 4 n + 2 = 2(n+1)^{2}.Thus, the statement is proved for all natural n. For n=100, we get that S leq 2 cdot 100^{2} = 20000.

Another proof is possible here that doesn't use as iterations of f : the idea is to \\"show f is injective up to sign outside its kernel\\". Specifically, if f(a)=f(b) neq 0, then a^{2} f(a)=f(f(a))=f(f(b))=b^{2} f(b) Longrightarrow a^{2}=b^{2}. But we also have f(f(x))=fleft(x^{2}right), so we are done except in the case f(f(x))=fleft(x^{2}right)=0. That would imply x^{2} f(x)=0, so the claim follows.Now, note that P(1, y) givesf(1-y)+2 y cdot f(1)=f(1)+f(y) .We consider cases on f(1) and show that f matches the desired form.- If f(1)=1, then f(1-y)+(2 y-1)=f(y).

Hence, there is some constant C>100 such that the latter eight equations are all false for any real number y>C. Consequently, f(y)=y^{2} for y>C.Finally, for any real number z>0, take x, y>C such that x^{2}-y=z; then P(x, y) proves f(z)=z^{2} too.- Note that (as f is even), f works iff -f works, so the case f(1)=-1 is analogous.- If f(1)=0, then f(1-y)=f(y). Hence for any y such that |1-y| neq|y|, we conclude f(y)=0. Then take P(2,7 / 2) Longrightarrow f(1 / 2)=0.Remark. There is another clever symmetry approach possible after the main claim. The idea is to writePleft(x, y^{2}right) Longrightarrow fleft(x^{2}-y^{2}right)+2 y^{2} f(x)=f(f(x))+f(f(y)) .Since f is even gives fleft(x^{2}-y^{2}right)=fleft(y^{2}-x^{2}right), one can swap the roles of x and y to get 2 y^{2} f(x)=2 x^{2} f(y).

By the induction hypothesis, there must be a player who wins all their matches among these n players, let's say A_{1}, A_{2}, ldots, A_{n}, where A_{1} wins all.For the other player A_{n+1}:If A_{1} wins A_{n+1}, then among the n+1 players, A_{1} wins all;If A_{1} draws with A_{n+1}, consider the players A_{1}, A_{2}, ldots, A_{n-1}, A_{n+1}, there is no one who wins all, which is impossible; if A_{n+1} wins A_{1}, consider the players A_{1}, A_{3}, A_{4}, ldots, A_{n}, A_{n+1}, the one who wins all can only be A_{n+1}, especially, A_{n+1} wins A_{3}, A_{4}, ldots, A_{n}.

For q geqslant 6, we have 9 mid q!. Then it must hold that p^{3}+5 equiv -7 r^{3} equiv 2 r^{3} (bmod 9). The remainders of cubes when divided by 9 can only be 0, 1, or 8 (which can be directly verified). Therefore, the left side of the previous relation is congruent to 5, 6, or 4 modulo 9, while the right side is congruent to 0, 2, or 7. From this, we conclude that there are no solutions for q geqslant 6.For q=0, we have q!=1, so the given equation reduces to p^{3}=7(7- r^{3})-41=8-7 r^{3}. For the right side to be non-negative (since the left side is non-negative), it must hold that r leqslant 1. For r=0, we get p=2, and for r=1, we get p=1. The same applies for q=1. This gives us a total of four of the seven solutions mentioned.Consider the case q=2. Then the given equation reduces to p^{3}=7(14- r^{3})-41=57-7 r^{3}, from which we have r leqslant 2. The only possibility is r=2 and p=1, giving us another solution. Similarly, for q=3, the right side of the given equation becomes 7(42-r^{3}), so r leqslant 3; it can be directly verified that for r in{0,1,2} there are no solutions, while for r=3 we have p^{3}=7 cdot (42-27)-41 = 7 cdot 15-41 = 64, i.e., p=4, giving us the sixth solution.To slightly reduce the number of cases to be examined for q=4 and q=5, we will make certain conclusions by considering the given equation modulo 8. For q geqslant 4, we have 8 mid q!, so we get 7(7 q!-r^{3}) equiv -7 r^{3} equiv r^{3} (bmod 8), i.e., (considering the left side of the given equation) p^{3}+1 equiv r^{3} (bmod 8). Note that for any even number a, a^{3} equiv 0 (bmod 8), and for any odd number a, a^{3} equiv a (bmod 8). From this, to satisfy the relation just derived, there are only two possibilities:p is an even number and r equiv 1 (bmod 8), or r is an even number and p equiv 7 (bmod 8).Now take q=4. From the condition 7 q!-r^{3} geqslant 0 we get r^{3} leqslant 7 cdot 24 = 168, i.e., r leqslant 5. Additionally, we have p^{3}=7(7 q!-r^{3})-41 < 49 q! = 1176, i.e., p leqslant 10. The first possibility from (*) directly gives r=1, i.e., p^{3}=7(7 cdot 24-1)-41=7 cdot 167-41=1128, so we do not get a solution here. The second possibility from (*) directly gives p=7, but then the left side of the given equation is not divisible by 7 while the right side is.Finally, take q=5. Similarly as before, we get r^{3} leqslant 7 cdot 120 = 840, i.e., r leqslant 9, and p^{3} < 49 cdot 120 = 5880, i.e., p leqslant 18. The first possibility from (*) gives r=1 or r=9; for r=1 we get p^{3}=7(7 cdot 120-1)-41=5832, i.e., p=18, which is the seventh solution, and for r=9 we get p^{3}=7(7 cdot 120-729)-41=7 cdot 111-41=736, so there is no solution here. The second possibility from (*) gives p=7, which is impossible as already seen, or p=15, in which case we have r^{3}=7 q!-frac{p^{3}+41}{7}=7 cdot 120-frac{3375+41}{7}=840-488=352, so there are no more solutions here.## First Grade - B Category"},{"problem":"12.007.

Understanding the Relationship Between the Hyperbola and the Angle with the y-axis:   - The acute angle formed with the y-axis corresponds to the angle of inclination of the asymptote of the hyperbola. For a hyperbola of the given form, the asymptotes are lines that pass through the origin and have slopes pm dfrac{b}{a}.   - Since the angle given is 60^{circ}, the complementary angle, which is the angle the asymptote actually makes with the x-axis, is 30^{circ}. Hence, we use the tangent of this angle to find the relationship between b and a.2. Finding the Relationship Between b and a:   - We have tan 30^{circ} = dfrac{sqrt{3}}{3}. This is equal to the slope of the asymptote, which is dfrac{b}{a}.   - Therefore, dfrac{b}{a} = dfrac{sqrt{3}}{3}.3. Calculating the Eccentricity (e):   - The eccentricity of a hyperbola is given by e = dfrac{c}{a}, where c is the distance from the center to a focus.

Find the greatest natural number that, for each its representation as a sum of positive integers, there exists a fleet such that the summands are exactly the numbers of squares contained in individual ships.","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the greatest natural number ( n ) such that for any partition of ( n ) into positive integers, there exists a fleet of ships on a ( 10 times 10 ) grid where the summands are exactly the numbers of squares contained in individual ships. The ships must be vertex-disjoint.2. Initial Observation:   The grid is ( 10 times 10 ), which contains ( 100 ) unit squares. We need to ensure that the ships are vertex-disjoint, meaning no two ships can share a common vertex.3. Partitioning the Grid:   Consider partitioning the ( 10 times 10 ) grid into ( 2 times 2 ) squares. Each ( 2 times 2 ) square contains 4 unit squares. There are ( frac{100}{4} = 25 ) such ( 2 times 2 ) squares in the grid.4. Maximum Number of Ships:   If we place one ship in each ( 2 times 2 ) square, we can have 25 ships, each occupying 4 unit squares. This configuration ensures that no two ships share a common vertex.5. Verification for ( n = 25 ):   For ( n = 25 ), we can represent ( 25 ) as a sum of 25 ones: ( 1 + 1 + cdots + 1 = 25 ). This means we need 25 ships, each containing 1 unit square. However, this is not possible because placing 25 ships, each containing 1 unit square, would require 25 unit squares, and ensuring they are vertex-disjoint is not feasible in a ( 10 times 10 ) grid.6. Verification for ( n = 24 ):   For ( n = 24 ), we can represent ( 24 ) as a sum of 24 ones: ( 1 + 1 + cdots + 1 = 24 ). This means we need 24 ships, each containing 1 unit square. This is also not feasible for the same reason as above.7. Verification for ( n = 25 ) with Different Partitions:   For ( n = 25 ), consider different partitions such as ( 4 + 4 + cdots + 4 + 1 = 25 ). We can place six ( 2 times 2 ) ships and one ship containing 1 unit square. This configuration is feasible and ensures that the ships are vertex-disjoint.8. Generalization:   For any ( 2k times 2m ) grid, the maximum number of vertex-disjoint ships is ( km ). For a ( 10 times 10 ) grid, ( k = 5 ) and ( m = 5 ), so the maximum number is ( 5 times 5 = 25 ).Conclusion:The greatest natural number ( n ) such that for any partition of ( n ) into positive integers, there exists a fleet of ships on a ( 10 times 10 ) grid where the summands are exactly the numbers of squares contained in individual ships, is ( 25 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ 25 } )."},{"problem":"Given the hyperbola C: frac{x^2}{a^2}-frac{y^2}{b^2}=1left(a gt 0,b gt 0right), one of its asymptotes has a slope of 2 and the focal length is 2sqrt{5}, then a=left(  right)A: 1B: 2C: 3D: 4","solution":"To solve the problem, we follow these steps closely aligned with the provided solution:1.

Subtract 180 from both sides:   [   0.18x = 4.5   ]9. Solve for (x) by dividing both sides by 0.18:   [   x = frac{4.5}{0.18} = 25   ]10.

Let's recalculate the common difference correctly:Since a_1=1 and S_7=28, we have that S_7=7/2*(a_1+a_7)=28. Now, since it is an arithmetic sequence with a_1=1, we express a_7 as a_1+6d=1+6d.

For June, if the usage is more than 200 kWh but less than 450 kWh, the price is 0.7/kWh for the amount exceeding 200 kWh.The equation based on the total fee is:0.5x + 200 times 0.5 + (500 - x - 200) times 0.7 = 290Simplifying this equation:0.5x + 100 + (300 - x) times 0.7 = 290 0.5x + 100 + 210 - 0.7x = 290 -0.2x = -20 x = 100Therefore, the electricity usage in May is 100 kWh, and for June:500 - x = 500 - 100 = 400 text{kWh}So, the electricity usage in May is boxed{100 text{kWh}} and in June is boxed{400 text{kWh}}.## Case 2: When 200 < x < 250For this case, we consider the pricing for electricity usage between 200 and 250 kWh for May and similarly for June.

For this ellipse, a=2 and b=1, so c=sqrt{2^2-1^2}=sqrt{3}. Thus, the foci are F_{1}(-sqrt{3}, 0) and F_{2}(sqrt{3}, 0).Given that the midpoint of segment PF_{1} lies on the y-axis, and knowing the geometry of the ellipse, it implies that PF_{1} is perpendicular to the major axis (the x-axis for this ellipse), and thus perpendicular to the line segment F_{1}F_{2}.To find |PF_{2}|, we use the property that the distance from any point on the ellipse to a focus is related to the ellipse's semi-minor axis b and semi-major axis a.

Using the sign analysis method, we can deduce that the inequality x^2 - 2x - 3 < 0 holds when -1 < x < 3. Hence, the solution set A is (-1, 3).Next, we find the solution set B of the inequality x^2 + x - 6 < 0. We again factor the quadratic:x^2 + x - 6 = (x - 2)(x + 3).The solutions to x - 2 = 0 and x + 3 = 0 are x = 2 and x = -3, respectively. Thus, the inequality holds when -3 < x < 2.

Partitioning the Set ( A ):   We start by partitioning the set ( A = {1, 2, ldots, n} ) into subsets of three consecutive integers. Specifically, we form the subsets:   [   {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}, ldots   ]   This partitioning continues until we cover all elements of ( A ). The number of such subsets is given by:   [   m = leftlceil frac{n}{3} rightrceil   ]   where ( leftlceil x rightrceil ) denotes the ceiling function, which rounds ( x ) up to the nearest integer.2. Condition Analysis:   We need to ensure that for any two elements ( x ) and ( y ) in subset ( B ), the condition ( x + y ) is not divisible by ( x - y ). 3. Maximum Number of Elements in ( B ):   If ( B ) contains more than ( m ) elements, then by the pigeonhole principle, at least two elements of ( B ) must lie in the same subset of the partition ( mathcal{P} ). We need to show that this would violate the given condition.4. Violation of Condition:   Consider any subset ( {a, a+1, a+2} ) from the partition ( mathcal{P} ). If we pick any two elements from this subset, say ( x ) and ( y ), we have:   [   x, y in {a, a+1, a+2}   ]   Without loss of generality, assume ( x < y ). Then ( x - y ) can be ( -1 ) or ( -2 ). For ( x + y ) to be divisible by ( x - y ), we need:   [   x + y equiv 0 pmod{x - y}   ]   This is impossible for any pair ( (x, y) ) within the same subset ( {a, a+1, a+2} ) because the differences ( x - y ) are too small to divide ( x + y ).5. Constructing ( B ):   To construct a subset ( B ) with exactly ( m ) elements, we can choose one element from each subset of the partition ( mathcal{P} ). For example:   [   B = {1, 4, 7, ldots} cap A   ]   This ensures that ( B ) has exactly ( m ) elements and satisfies the condition that ( x + y ) is not divisible by ( x - y ) for any ( x, y in B ).6.

This is a characteristic property of an ellipse, where the sum of distances from any point on the ellipse to its two foci is constant.Given that the sum of the distances is 10, we can denote the major axis length as 2a=10.

We will use a construction method to find the maximum number of buildings that can be built on one side of the street.1. Understanding the constraints:   - The maximum number of stories a building can have is 9.   - If two buildings have the same number of stories, there must be a building with a higher number of stories between them.2. Constructing the sequence:   - We start by placing the highest story building (9 stories) first.   - Next, we place two 8-story buildings, ensuring that they are separated by the 9-story building.   - Then, we place four 7-story buildings, ensuring that each pair of 7-story buildings is separated by an 8-story building.   - We continue this pattern until we place the 1-story buildings.3. Pattern and calculation:   - For each story level (i) (where (i) ranges from 1 to 9), the number of buildings with (i) stories is (2^{9-i}).   - Summing these up, we get the total number of buildings:     [     sum_{i=0}^{8} 2^i = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + cdots + 2^8     ]   - This is a geometric series with the first term (a = 1) and common ratio (r = 2).

Thus, for all x, f(x)=0 or f(x)=x.Clearly, f equiv 0 satisfies the original equation, so suppose there exists a non-zero x with f(x)=x.

For n geq 1, dividing by n gives z=2. Thus, the polynomial p(t) must be of the form a t^{2}+b t+c, where a neq 0.Suppose in the polynomial f(x), a_{n-1}=a_{n-2}=cdots=a_{k+1}=0, but a_{k} neq 0 and k geq 1:f(x)=a_{n} x^{n}+a_{k} x^{k}+cdots+a_{0}The coefficient of x^{n+k} in the polynomial f^{2}(x) is 2 a_{n} a_{k}, and in the polynomial f(x) it is 0, because f(x) is of degree n. Thus, in the polynomial p(f(x))=a f^{2}(x)+b f(x)+c, this coefficient is 2 a a_{n} a_{k}. But f^{2}(x)=a_{n} x^{2 n}+a_{k} x^{2 k}+ldots, and here the coefficient of x^{n+k} is 0, because 2 n>n+k>2 k. Then 0=2 a a_{n} a_{k}, which contradicts the fact that the numbers a, a_{n}, a_{k} are not zero.Thus, for n geq 0, the polynomial f(x) can only be of the form a_{n} x^{n}+a_{0}. If n=0, then f(x)=a_{0}, and this polynomial always satisfies the problem if the polynomial p(t) is chosen to be a_{0}.We still need to examine the case when f(x)=a_{n} x^{n}+a_{0}, where a_{n} neq 0.

For an arbitrary point P in space with |overrightarrow{OP}|=1, we represent overrightarrow{OP} as (x,y,z).

The length of the median on side AC is ____.","solution":"To solve for the length of the median on side AC in triangle triangle ABC, we follow these steps:1. Given that the equation x^{2}-4x+b=0 has two equal real roots, we can determine the value of b by using the discriminant formula for a quadratic equation, Delta = b^2 - 4ac. For this equation, a=1, b=-4, and c=b (not to be confused with the side length b), so the discriminant is Delta = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(b) = 16 - 4b. Since the roots are equal, Delta = 0, thus:[16 - 4b = 0][16 = 4b][b = 4]2. With b=4, we know that AC = b = 4.3. Given BC=2 and AB=2sqrt{3}, we can check if triangle ABC is a right triangle by applying the Pythagorean theorem:[BC^2 + AB^2 = AC^2][2^2 + (2sqrt{3})^2 = 4^2][4 + 12 = 16][16 = 16]This confirms that triangle ABC is a right triangle with AC as the hypotenuse.4. In a right triangle, the median to the hypotenuse is half the length of the hypotenuse.

Consider the cases (a = c), (a > c), and (a < c):   - If (a = c), then:     [     a^b cdot b^a = a^a     ]     This simplifies to:     [     a^b cdot b^a = a^a     ]     Since (a neq 0), we must have (a = b = c = 1).   - If (a > c), then:     [     a^{2c} < a^{a+c} leq c^a < a^a     ]     This is a contradiction unless (a = 1).   - If (c > a), then:     [     (a^2)^a leq a^{a+c} leq c^a     ]     This implies:     [     a^2 leq c     ]     If (a^n leq c) for some integer (n), then:     [     a^{1+a^{n-1}} leq c     ]     This leads to a contradiction unless (a = 1).5.

Consider the structure of the grid and the coloring:   - To minimize the number of internal sides, we should aim to group the colors together as much as possible.   - One way to do this is to divide the grid into three large contiguous regions, each containing 363 unit squares.4.

Optimal division strategy:   - One possible way to divide the grid is to use two straight lines, one horizontal and one vertical, to create three regions.   - For example, we can divide the grid into three regions of (11 times 33), (11 times 33), and (11 times 33) (with some adjustments to ensure each region has exactly 363 squares).6. Calculate the number of internal sides for this division:   - Each division line will create internal sides along its length.   - A horizontal line across 33 columns will create 33 internal sides.   - A vertical line across 33 rows will create 33 internal sides.   - Therefore, the total number of internal sides is (33 + 33 = 66).7. Check for possible improvements:   - We can try to reduce the number of internal sides by considering different shapes or arrangements, but the straight-line division is already quite efficient.   - Any other arrangement would likely increase the number of internal sides due to the irregular boundaries.Therefore, the minimum possible number of internal sides is (66).The final answer is (boxed{66})"},{"problem":"9.3.

Linear Model (f(x)=kx+b):    - The derivative {f'}(x)=k is constant, indicating a constant rate of increase in the bonus. This meets the first requirement but fails the second since the increase does not accelerate.2. Logarithmic Model (f(x)=klog _{2}x+b):   - The derivative {f'}(x)=frac{k}{xln2} decreases as x increases, which means although the bonus increases with sales performance, the rate of increase slows down. This does not meet the second requirement.3. Quadratic Model (f(x)=kx^{2}+b):   - The derivative {f'}(x)=2kx increases as x increases, indicating not only does the bonus increase with sales performance, but the rate of increase also accelerates. This meets both requirements.Therefore, the suitable function model is the Quadratic Model (f(x)=kx^{2}+b), as it satisfies both requirements of the new \\"employee incentive plan\\".# Part 2: Calculating the Bonus for 200 Thousand Dollars Sales PerformanceGiven:- f(10)=0- f(20)=2We substitute these into the quadratic model to find k and b:1. From f(10)=0, we get kcdot10^2+b=0.2. From f(20)=2, we get kcdot20^2+b=2.Solving this system of equations:- From the first equation, 100k+b=0.- From the second equation, 400k+b=2.Subtracting the first equation from the second gives 300k=2, leading to k=frac{1}{150}. Substituting k back into the first equation gives b=-frac{2}{3}.Thus, the function model is f(x)=frac{x^2}{150}-frac{2}{3}.To find the bonus when the sales performance is 200 thousand dollars, we substitute x=200:f(200)=frac{200^2}{150}-frac{2}{3}=frac{40000}{150}-frac{2}{3}=266frac{2}{3}-frac{2}{3}=266Hence, the bonus when the sales performance is 200 thousand dollars is boxed{266} thousand dollars."},{"problem":"If we increase one leg of a right triangle by 5 and decrease the other leg by 5, the area of the triangle increases by 5.

Multiplying both equations, we get frac{sin 8 x}{sin 4 x}=frac{|B C|}{|A D|}. Now we apply the sine rule to triangle A B D and get frac{sin 5 x}{sin 3 x}=frac{|A B|}{|A D|}=frac{|B C|}{|A D|}. From both derived equations, it follows that frac{sin 5 x}{sin 3 x}=frac{sin 8 x}{sin 4 x}. Using the double angle formula, we get frac{sin 5 x}{sin 3 x}=frac{2 sin 4 x cos 4 x}{sin 4 x}=2 cos 4 x, and thus 2 sin 3 x cos 4 x=sin 5 x. We factorize the left side as sin 7 x + sin (-x) = sin 5 x, and considering the oddness of the sine function, we rewrite the equation as sin 7 x + sin (-5 x) = sin x. Now we factorize the left side again to get 2 sin x cos 6 x = sin x. Since sin x neq 0, we can cancel sin x from both sides and get cos 6 x = frac{1}{2}. Since 0^{circ} < 6 x < 8 x < 180^{circ}, it follows that 6 x = 60^{circ} or x = 10^{circ}. The internal angles of the trapezoid are therefore beta = 4 x = 40^{circ}, gamma = 180^{circ} - beta = 140^{circ}, delta = 8 x = 80^{circ}, and alpha = 180^{circ} - delta = 100^{circ}.2. method. By the sine rule for triangle A B D, we get frac{|A B|}{|B D|}=frac{sin 5 x}{sin (180^{circ} - 8 x)}=frac{sin 5 x}{sin 8 x}, and by the sine rule for triangle B C D, we get frac{|B C|}{|B D|}=frac{sin 3 x}{sin (180^{circ} - 4 x)}=frac{sin 3 x}{sin 4 x}. Since |A B| = |B C|, both expressions are equal, so frac{sin 5 x}{sin 8 x}=frac{sin 3 x}{sin 4 x}. From this, as in the first solution, we derive 2 sin 3 x cos 4 x = sin 5 x. We multiply this equation by cos 3 x and use the double angle formula on the left side to get sin 6 x cos 4 x = sin 5 x cos 3 x. We factorize both sides as sin 10 x + sin 2 x = sin 8 x + sin 2 x and simplify the equation to sin 10 x = sin 8 x. Since 0^{circ} < 8 x < 180^{circ}, the angles 8 x and 10 x are different and less than 360^{circ}, so it follows that 10 x = 180^{circ} - 8 x or x = 10^{circ}. From this, as in the first solution, we calculate the internal angles of the trapezoid as beta = 40^{circ}, gamma = 140^{circ}, delta = 80^{circ}, and alpha = 100^{circ}.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_07_21f8af0300261b15ee68g-28.jpg?height=60&width=1742&top_left_y=1775&top_left_x=174)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_07_21f8af0300261b15ee68g-28.jpg?height=60&width=1685&top_left_y=1872&top_left_x=228)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_07_21f8af0300261b15ee68g-28.jpg?height=80&width=1687&top_left_y=1962&top_left_x=230)The derived equation sin (5 x) = 2 sin (3 x) cos (4 x) ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldotsCorrect factorization and knowledge of the oddness of the sine function .......................... 1 pointThe derived equation 2 sin (x) cos (6 x) = sin (x) ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots ldotsJustified why x = 10^{circ} and the derived angles of the quadrilateral .......................................## 65th Mathematical Competition for High School Students in Slovenia## National Competition, May 15, 2021 Solutions to Problems for 4th Year| A1 | A2 | A3 || :---: | :---: | :---: || B | E | A |"},{"problem":"Given the curve C: frac{x^{2}}{4} + frac{y^{2}}{9} = 1, and the line l: begin{cases} x=2+t  y=2-2t end{cases} (where t is a parameter).(I) Write the parametric equation of the curve C and the general equation of the line l.(II) Through any point P on the curve C, a line is drawn such that it forms a 30^{circ} angle with l, intersecting l at point A.

Note that the grasshoppers are one or several consecutive jumps apart from each other.

Therefore, the possible values for m are 1, 2, and 3. It is easy to see that all these cases are possible: a distance of 9 can be achieved with three jumps (2+3+4), two jumps (4+5), or one jump.If there are m jumps between the grasshoppers, then each second the distance between them will increase by m, since each of the m terms corresponding to individual jumps increases by 1.

Conversely, if G is a good grid, then for any integer j^{prime}, the column j^{prime} contains one of the integers from the row i. This integer is therefore at most 4, which shows that c_{j^{prime}} leqslant 4. Similarly, for any integer i^{prime}, we have ell_{i^{prime}} geqslant 4. Therefore, we indeed have min left{ell_{1}, ell_{2}, ell_{3}right}=max left{c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}right}=4.Consequently, we are actually trying to count how many good grids there are. To construct a good grid, it suffices to choose successively:triangleright the integers i and j, i.e., the position of the 4: there are 9 possible choices;triangleright each of the two other integers that are on the row i. Since l_{i}=4, these two integers must be smaller than 4, so they must be chosen from {1,2,3}. There are 3 ways to choose the first (say the leftmost), and 2 ways to choose the second;triangleright each of the two other integers that are on the column j. Since c_{j}=4, the two other integers must be greater than 4, so they must be chosen from {5,6,7,8,9}. There are 5 ways to choose the first, and 4 ways to choose the second;triangleright each of the four remaining integers to be placed: there are 4! ways to proceed.

Therefore, there are two possibilities left:1) n has the third digit equal to zero; the decimal representation of n is of the form n=a b 0, n_{0}=a b and n_{0} mid n for any choice of a in{1, ldots, 9} and b in{0,1, ldots, 9}. Relative to this case, there are thus 9 times 10=90 possibilities for n.2) n has the third digit different from zero but the second digit equal to zero; in this case n is written in the form a 0 b and n_{0} in the form a b. Recalling the meaning of the decimal representation, we seek the cases where 10 a+b divides 100 a+b. Since 10 a+b certainly divides 10(10 a+b)=100 a+10 b, it is also equivalent to see when 10 a+b divides the difference (100 a+10 b)-(10 a+b)=9 b.Writing k(10 a+b)=100 a+b and considering the last decimal digit, we obtain that (k-1) b is divisible by 10, so at least one of k-1 and b is divisible by 5. Since obviously 1<k<10 and 1 leq b leq 9, we have that k-1=5 or b=5.For k-1=5 we get 60 a+6 b=100 a+b, from which b=8 a and thus a=1, b=8. It is verified that n=108 is indeed a solution, as 18 divides 108.For b=5 we use the equivalent property that 10 a+b divides 9 b, which becomes 10 a+5 divides 45; it is immediately seen that the divisors of 45 of the form 10 a+5 with a geq 1 are 15 and 45, giving the two solutions n=105 (15 divides 105) and n=405 (45 divides 405).In conclusion, there are 90 solutions in case 1) and 3 solutions in case 2), for a total of 93 solutions."},{"problem":"When the natural numbers P and P', with P>P', are divided by the natural number D, the remainders are R and R', respectively.

The minimum value of this sum is frac{N}{2} for even N and frac{N+1}{2} for odd N. According to the problem, after the first round, there will be no fewer than 255 leaders, after the second round - no fewer than 128, and after each subsequent round, the number of leaders will decrease by no more than half. Therefore, it will take no fewer than 2+log _{2} 128=9 rounds.We will show that the tournament can be completed in 9 rounds. We will prove two statements.1) In a tournament with 2^{n} participants, the winner can be determined in n rounds. We will use induction on n. For n=1, this is obvious. Suppose the statement is true for some n. Then, in a tournament with 2^{n+1} participants, after the first round, 2^{n} athletes will have 0 points and 2^{n} will have 1 point. We will conduct two independent tournaments in these groups. By the induction hypothesis, both can be completed in n rounds. The winner of the second tournament will become the overall winner, and he will be determined in n+1 rounds.2) For n geqslant 3, in a tournament with 2^{n}-2 participants, the winner can be determined in n rounds. After the first round, 2^{n-1}-1 athletes will have 0 points and 2^{n-1}-1 will have 1 point. If in the second round, only one pair of opponents has a different number of points, then after the round, 2^{n-2} participants will have 0 points and 2 points, and 2^{n-1}-2 participants will have 1 point. We will now use induction on n. For n=3, we will pair athletes with the same number of points, after which the tournament will end. Suppose n>3 and the statement is true for n-1. By statement 1) and the induction hypothesis, independent tournaments can be organized in the groups with 0, 1, and 2 points, and the first and third groups will end in n-2 rounds, while the second group will end in n-1 rounds (but the last round will not be needed). The winner of the third group will win the entire tournament, as he will have n+1 points, while participants from other groups will have no more than n points.

If g(x) is an even function, which of the following conclusions may not necessarily hold?A: f(-1) = f(-3)B: {g'}(2) = 0C: f(4) = 2D: f(1) + f(3) = 4","solution":"Given that g(x) is an even function, we have g(-x) = g(x). Differentiating both sides with respect to x, we get -{g'}(-x) = {g'}(x). This implies that {g'}(x) is an odd function and, specifically, {g'}(0) = 0.Let's analyze the given options step by step:For option C:Given f(x) - {g'}(4-x) = 2, let x = 4. This gives us f(4) - {g'}(0) = 2. Since we know {g'}(0) = 0, we find f(4) = 2. Therefore, option C is correct, and we can write this as:[f(4) = 2 + {g'}(0) = 2 + 0 = 2]For option B:Given the system of equations from the problem statement:[begin{cases} f(x) + {g'}(x) = 2  f(x) - {g'}(4-x) = 2 end{cases}]Let x = 2. This gives us:[begin{cases} f(2) + {g'}(2) = 2  f(2) - {g'}(2) = 2 end{cases}]Solving this system, we find f(2) = 2 and {g'}(2) = 0. Therefore, option B is correct.For option D:Given f(x) + {g'}(x) = 2 and substituting x with 2+x, we get f(2+x) + {g'}(2+x) = 2. Since f(x) - {g'}(4-x) = 2, adding these two equations yields f(2+x) + f(2-x) = 4. This implies that f(x) is symmetric about the point (2,2), and hence f(1) + f(3) = 4. Therefore, option D is correct.For option A:Given f(x) + {g'}(x) = 2, substituting x with x+4, we get f(x+4) + {g'}(x+4) = 2. Since f(x) - {g'}(4-x) = 2, adding these equations yields f(x) = f(x+4). This means f(x) has a period of 4. However, f(-1) + f(-3) = 4 does not necessarily imply f(-1) = f(-3), so option A may not necessarily hold.Therefore, the answer is: boxed{A}."},{"problem":"Given sets A={x|log _{2}x lt 1} and B={xleft|right.-1 lt x lt 1}, then ( )A: A⫋BB: B⫋AC: A=BD: Acap Bneq varnothing ","solution":"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and analyze it step by step.1. Determine Set A:   - We are given A={x|log _{2}x < 1}.   - To find the range of x, we solve the inequality log _{2}x < 1.     - We know that log _{2}x = 1 when x=2 because 2^1 = 2.     - Therefore, log _{2}x < 1 implies 0 < x < 2 (since log _{2}x is undefined for x leq 0).   - Thus, A=(0,2).2. Determine Set B:   - From the problem, B={x|-1 < x < 1}.   - This directly gives us the range of B as (-1, 1).3. Analyze the Relationship Between Sets A and B:   - For Option A (A⫋B): This implies A is a proper subset of B. Given A=(0,2) and B=(-1,1), it's clear that not all elements of A are contained in B (specifically, elements in (1,2)). Hence, this option is incorrect.   - For Option B (B⫋A): This implies B is a proper subset of A. Given B=(-1,1) and A=(0,2), while all elements of B are contained in A, B does not include all elements of A, making it a proper subset. However, the statement \\"B⫋A is not true\\" is incorrect in the standard solution; it should be considered true based on the definition of proper subsets. This seems to be a misinterpretation in the standard solution.   - For Option C (A=B): This implies that sets A and B are equal. Given A=(0,2) and B=(-1,1), it's clear they are not equal because they contain different elements. Hence, this option is incorrect.   - For Option D (Acap Bneq varnothing ): This implies that sets A and B have a non-empty intersection. Since A=(0,2) and B=(-1,1), their intersection is (0,1), which is indeed non-empty. Therefore, this option is correct.Given the analysis, the correct answer is:boxed{D}"},{"problem":"Example 10.
