We have a n times n table and each square is colored either black or white. Suppose that for all m times m sub-tables from the table (m > 1), the number of black squares is not more than white squares. Find the maximum number of black squares.","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the maximum number of black squares in an ( n times n ) table such that for any ( m times m ) sub-table (where ( m > 1 )), the number of black squares is not more than the number of white squares. Given that ( n ) is divisible by 3, we can write ( n = 3k ) for some integer ( k ).2. Construction of the Table:   We color the cells with coordinates ((a, b)) black if and only if ((a, b)) are ((1,2), (2,1), (3,2), (2,3)) modulo 3. This means:   - A cell ((a, b)) is black if ( a equiv 1 pmod{3} ) and ( b equiv 2 pmod{3} )   - A cell ((a, b)) is black if ( a equiv 2 pmod{3} ) and ( b equiv 1 pmod{3} )   - A cell ((a, b)) is black if ( a equiv 3 pmod{3} ) and ( b equiv 2 pmod{3} )   - A cell ((a, b)) is black if ( a equiv 2 pmod{3} ) and ( b equiv 3 pmod{3} )3. Counting the Black Squares:   Each ( 3 times 3 ) block in the table will have exactly 4 black squares. Since the table is ( n times n ) and ( n = 3k ), there are ( k^2 ) such ( 3 times 3 ) blocks in the table. Therefore, the total number of black squares is:   [   4 times k^2 = 4 times left(frac{n}{3}right)^2 = frac{4n^2}{9}   ]4. Verification:   We need to verify that any ( m times m ) sub-table (where ( m > 1 )) has at most half of its cells black. Consider any ( 2 times m ) or ( 3 times m ) rectangle:   - For ( 2 times m ) rectangles, since ( m ) can be written as ( 2a + 3b ) for non-negative integers ( a ) and ( b ), the number of black squares will be at most half of the total cells.   - For ( 3 times m ) rectangles, the same logic applies, ensuring that the number of black squares is at most half of the total cells.   This construction ensures that the condition is satisfied for all ( m times m ) sub-tables where ( m > 1 ).The final answer is (boxed{frac{4n^2}{9}})"},{"problem":"Let overrightarrow{a}=(1,2), overrightarrow{b}=(1,1), and overrightarrow{c}= overrightarrow{a}+k overrightarrow{b}.

Identify the given information and set up the problem:   - Square (ABCD) has center (O).   - Side length (AB = 900).   - Points (E) and (F) are on (AB) with (AE < BF) and (E) between (A) and (F).   - (angle EOF = 45^circ).   - (EF = 400).2. Determine the coordinates of the points:   - Let (A = (0, 900)), (B = (900, 900)), (C = (900, 0)), and (D = (0, 0)).   - The center (O) of the square is ((450, 450)).3. Place points (E) and (F) on (AB):   - Let (E = (x, 900)) and (F = (y, 900)) with (0 < x < y < 900).   - Given (EF = 400), we have (y - x = 400).4.

Calculate the coordinates of (P):   - Since (triangle EPF) is an isosceles right triangle, the distance (EP = PF = frac{EF}{sqrt{2}} = frac{400}{sqrt{2}} = 200sqrt{2}).6. Determine the coordinates of (P):   - The coordinates of (P) can be found by using the midpoint formula and the properties of the isosceles right triangle.   - Let (P = (p_x, p_y)). Since (P) is the circumcenter, it lies on the perpendicular bisector of (EF).   - The midpoint of (EF) is (left(frac{x+y}{2}, 900right)).   - Since (y = x + 400), the midpoint is (left(frac{2x + 400}{2}, 900right) = (x + 200, 900)).7. Calculate the distance (OP):   - The distance (OP) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle with legs (OQ) and (PQ).   - (OQ = 450 - x) and (PQ = 200sqrt{2}).8. Use the Pythagorean theorem to find (PQ):   - (PQ = sqrt{(x + 200 - 450)^2 + (900 - 450)^2} = sqrt{(x - 250)^2 + 450^2}).   - Since (PQ = 200sqrt{2}), we have:     [     (x - 250)^2 + 450^2 = (200sqrt{2})^2     ]     [     (x - 250)^2 + 202500 = 80000     ]     [     (x - 250)^2 = 80000 - 202500 = -122500     ]     This equation is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate our approach.9.

[For example, 55677 is acceptable, 54 is not.] Solution","solution":": 2002C9 = 1,398,276,498,745,133,921,413,500. Let mCn represent the binomial coefficient m!/(n! (m-n)! ). We prove first a simple lemma: kCk + (k+1)Ck + (k+2)Ck + ... + nCk = (n+1)C(k+1). This is an almost trivial induction. It is obviously true for n = k. Suppose it is true for n. Then the sum up to (n+1)Ck = (n+1)C(k+1) + (n+1)Ck = (n+2)C(k+1) as required. Call numbers with non-decreasing digits NDDs. 0 is a special case, it is the only NDD involving the digit zero. It is convenient to regard 0 as having 0 digits. With this convention, we show that in base n there are (n+m-2)Cm NDDs with m digits. We use induction on m. Clearly the result is true for m = 1 (and any n) provided we accept the convention just stated. Suppose it is true for m. Now consider an m+1 digit number. If its first digit is 1, then the remaining digits form an m digit NDD, so there are just (n+m-2)Cm possibilities. If the first digit is 2, then the remaining m digits are all at least 2, so the number of possibilities is the same as for m digit NDDs to base m-1, which is (n+m-3)Cm. Similarly, for first digit 3 we have (n+m-4)Cm possibilities, and so on down to (n+m-n)Cm = 1 possibilities for first digit n. Hence the total number of possibilities is mCm + (m+1)Cm + (m+2)Cm + ... + (m+n-2)Cm = (m+n-1)C(m+1), by the lemma. So the result is true for m+1. Hence for all m. In particular, there are (n+8)C8 n-digit decimal NDDs. Note that n=0 also gives the correct number 1 for 0-digit numbers. Hence there are 8C8 + 9C8 + ... + 2001C8 decimal numbers with at most 1993 digits and all digits non-decreasing.

The statement gives g(x+y)=g(x)+g(y). Thus, g satisfies the Cauchy equation...on mathbb{R}^{*}, not on mathbb{R}! We cannot directly conclude that g is linear on mathbb{Q}: a standard property of functions satisfying the Cauchy equation on a set containing at least mathbb{Q}, but here, we cannot choose x=0 or y=0. Thus, we have fewer constraints on g. However, we can prove, as for the Cauchy equation on mathbb{Q}, that g is linear on mathbb{Q}_{+}^{*} (prove by induction on mathbb{N}^{*} that g(n)=n g(1), and that g(1)=n g(1 / n), then write that g(p / q)=p g(1 / q)=p / q g(1) for all left.p, q in mathbb{N}^{*}right) and similarly on mathbb{Q}_{-}^{*}. Therefore, there exist a, b in mathbb{R}^{*} such that g(x)=a x if x>0 and g(x)=b x if x>0. By setting x=2 and y=-1 in the equation g(x+y)=g(x)+g(y), we get a=2 a-b hence a=b.Thus g is linear on mathbb{Q}^{*}. Moreover, it is increasing. Thus a>0, and for any non-zero real r, for all rationals q leqslant r leqslant q^{prime}, we have a q leqslant g(r) leqslant a q^{prime}. We can take q and q^{prime} arbitrarily close to r since mathbb{Q} is dense in mathbb{R}. Thus, g(r)=a r for any non-zero real r.Therefore,f(x)=frac{1}{a x}for all x in mathbb{R}^{*}.

A point ((x, y, z)) can be seen from the origin if and only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of (x), (y), and (z) is 1, i.e., (gcd(x, y, z) = 1).1. Understanding the Probability ( p ):   The probability ( p ) that a randomly selected point ((x, y, z)) can be seen from the origin is the probability that (gcd(x, y, z) = 1). This is equivalent to the probability that (x), (y), and (z) are coprime.2. Using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion:   To find this probability, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Complementary Probability:   The probability that ( x ), ( y ), and ( z ) are coprime is the product over all primes ( p ) of the complementary probabilities:   [   p = prod_{p text{ prime}} left(1 - P(p mid x text{ or } p mid y text{ or } p mid z)right) = prod_{p text{ prime}} left(1 - left(1 - left(1 - frac{1}{p}right)^3right)right)   ]   Simplifying the expression inside the product:   [   p = prod_{p text{ prime}} left(1 - left(1 - left(1 - frac{1}{p}right)^3right)right) = prod_{p text{ prime}} left(1 - left(1 - left(1 - frac{3}{p} + frac{3}{p^2} - frac{1}{p^3}right)right)right)   ]   [   p = prod_{p text{ prime}} left(left(1 - frac{1}{p}right)^3right)   ]4.

A few general remarks:triangleright Several papers confuse the words \\"equilateral\\" and \\"isosceles.\\" We recall that a triangle X Y Z is said to be isosceles at X if the sides [X Y] and [X Z] are of the same length, whereas a triangle X Y Z is said to be equilateral if all three sides are of the same length. Thus, an equilateral triangle is always isosceles, but the converse is not true.triangleright We emphasize the importance of reading the problem statement carefully, as several students placed point S outside the square instead of inside, thus penalizing themselves despite often correct reasoning.triangleright Regarding the writing, it is too often neglected, even by good students: we remind that a figure does not constitute a proof; a drawing is there to illustrate and accompany a reasoning, not to replace it. Be careful also not to over-write: it is not necessary to detail too much, at the risk of losing time that could have been used to solve other exercises; here, arguments such as the symmetry of the figure could have reduced the size of the proof.triangleright Furthermore, some students ventured into analytic geometry calculations: this can sometimes work, but it is not recommended, as an analytic proof that does not work is not valued, and there are often simpler methods.triangleright Finally, it is important to make a large and accurate figure, as several students made mistakes and did not realize their errors due to an absent or poorly made figure, which can be misleading."},{"problem":"1.

Hence, option B is incorrect, and we have boxed{B text{is incorrect}}.Option C:For f(x) to be monotonically increasing on [{0,frac{π}{2}}], we consider the range of ωx+frac{π}{3} when x∈[{0,frac{π}{2}}]:[ωx+frac{π}{3}∈left[frac{π}{3},frac{π}{2}ω+frac{π}{3}right]]For monotonic increase, the upper bound of this range should not exceed frac{π}{2}, leading to:[frac{π}{2}ω+frac{π}{3} ≤ frac{π}{2} implies ω ≤ frac{1}{3}]Given ω＞0, we find 0＜ω≤frac{1}{3}. Thus, option C is correct, and we have boxed{C text{is correct}}.Option D:Shifting the graph of f(x) to the right by frac{π}{3} units, we get f(x-frac{π}{3})=sin(ωx-frac{π}{3}ω+frac{π}{3}). For this to be an even function, we equate -frac{π}{3}ω+frac{π}{3} to frac{π}{2}+kπ where k∈Z:[-frac{π}{3}ω+frac{π}{3} = frac{π}{2}+kπ implies ω = -frac{1}{2}-3k]Since ω＞0, the minimum value of ω is not frac{3}{2} as suggested by option D. Instead, by solving for ω considering it must be positive, we find the minimum value of ω to be frac{5}{2}.

The company found through sales records that when the selling price does not exceed 13 yuan, the daily net profit after donation increases with the increase in the selling price x (in yuan per kilogram). Find the range of values for a.","solution":" Solution:# Part 1: Finding the Functional RelationshipGiven that when the selling price is 10 yuan, 300 kilograms can be sold per day. For every increase of 1 yuan in the selling price, the daily sales volume decreases by 50 kilograms. Let's denote the selling price as x (in yuan per kilogram) and the daily sales volume as y (in kilograms). When x = 10, y = 300. If the selling price increases by 1 yuan, the sales volume decreases by 50 kilograms, which can be represented as:[y = 300 - 50(x - 10)]Expanding this, we get:[y = 300 - 50x + 500][y = -50x + 800]Thus, the functional relationship between the daily sales volume y and the selling price x is:[y = -50x + 800]# Part 2: Maximum Profit CalculationGiven that the daily sales volume is not less than 250 kilograms, we set up the inequality:[-50x + 800 geq 250]Solving for x, we find:[800 - 250 geq 50x][550 geq 50x][x leq 11]The profit w is calculated as the difference between the selling price and the cost price, multiplied by the sales volume, which gives us:[w = (x - 8)(-50x + 800)]Expanding and simplifying:[w = -50x^2 + 1200x - 6400][w = -50(x^2 - 24x + 128)][w = -50(x - 12)^2 + 800]Since the coefficient of x^2 is negative, the profit function opens downwards, indicating a maximum value at the vertex. The vertex occurs at x = 12, but since the sales volume must be at least 250 kilograms, we consider x leq 11. Therefore, at x = 11, we find the maximum profit:[w = -50(11 - 12)^2 + 800][w = -50(-1)^2 + 800][w = -50 + 800][w = 750]Thus, the maximum profit w that the supermarket can make from selling this fruit per day is boxed{750} yuan when the selling price is 11 yuan per kilogram.# Part 3: Range of Values for aLet the net daily profit after donation be S yuan.

Therefore, it is impossible to move the cards as required at this time.Assume n < k, we will prove that it is always possible to move the cards as required.Pair the cards as follows:(1,2),(3,4), cdots,(2n-1,2n),and assign each pair to an empty blue box. At this point, there is at least one blue box without a pair assigned (called a \\"free box\\"). We sequentially move the topmost card in the red box to its \\"own\\" blue box. If at some step it cannot be done, it must be that a card numbered 2i-1 has already entered its \\"own\\" blue box, preventing the card numbered 2i from entering its \\"own\\" blue box. In this case, place the card numbered 2i in the \\"free box\\", then move the card numbered 2i-1 on top of it, and change their original blue box to a \\"free box\\". This way, each pair of cards can be moved into a blue box, with the smaller number on top. At this point, using the \\"free box\\", all cards can be moved into one blue box."},{"problem":"Given that alpha and beta are acute angles, sinalpha=frac{{2sqrt{5}}}{5}, cos({pi-beta})=-frac{{sqrt{2}}}{{10}}.

Looking at the table, we see that when the number of passengers x is 300, the profit y is 0. This means that to ensure no loss, the bus needs at least 300 passengers per day. Therefore, to ensure no loss, the bus should have at least boxed{300} passengers per day.# Part 2: Estimating Profit for 500 PassengersFrom the table, we observe that for every increase of 50 passengers, the profit increases by 100 dollars. This pattern suggests a linear relationship between the number of passengers and the profit. Given that the profit is 200 dollars for 400 passengers, we can calculate the profit for 500 passengers by adding 100 dollars for each additional 50 passengers. Since 500 - 400 = 100, this corresponds to two increments of 50 passengers, resulting in an additional profit of 200 dollars. Therefore, the profit when there are 500 passengers is 200 + 200 = boxed{400} dollars.# Part 3: Expression for the Relationship Between y and xTo find the expression for the relationship between y (profit) and x (number of passengers), we assume a linear relationship of the form y = kx + b, where k is the slope and b is the y-intercept.Given two points from the table, (300, 0) and (350, 100), we can set up a system of equations to find k and b:1. 300k + b = 02. 350k + b = 100Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us 50k = 100, which simplifies to k = 2.

Therefore, the total transportation cost y is minimized when v=5sqrt{a}.(Alternatively, use the AM-GM inequality: when 5sqrt{a}<60, i.e., a<144, we have y=s(frac{a}{v}+frac{v}{25})geq 2ssqrt{frac{a}{25}}, with equality if and only if frac{a}{v}=frac{v}{25}, i.e., v=5sqrt{a}.)When 5sqrt{a}geq 60, i.e., ageq 144, the function y=s(frac{a}{v}+frac{v}{25}) is decreasing on (0, 60].

Since 63 can be factored into (63 = 7 times 9), the oneic number must be divisible by both 7 and 9.1. Divisibility by 9:   A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.

Finding the smallest (n):   We need to find the smallest (n) such that (10^n equiv 1 pmod{63}). We can use the order of 10 modulo 63 to find this (n). The order of 10 modulo 63 is the smallest positive integer (d) such that (10^d equiv 1 pmod{63}).

So either f(u) = 1/2 for all u, or f(0) = 0. f(u) = 1/2 for all u is certainly a solution. So assume f(0) = 0. Putting y = v = 0, f(x) f(u) = f(xu) (*). In particular, taking x = u = 1, f(1) 2 = f(1). So f(1) = 0 or 1. Suppose f(1) = 0. Putting x = y = 1, v = 0, we get 0 = 2f(u), so f(x) = 0 or all x. That is certainly a solution. So assume f(1) = 1. Putting x = 0, u = v = 1 we get 2 f(y) = f(y) + f(-y), so f(-y) = f(y). So we need only consider f(x) for x positive. We show next that f(r) = r 2 for r rational. The first step is to show that f(n) = n 2 for n an integer. We use induction on n. It is true for n = 0 and 1. Suppose it is true for n-1 and n. Then putting x = n, y = u = v = 1, we get 2f(n) + 2 = f(n-1) + f(n+1), so f(n+1) = 2n 2 + 2 - (n-1) 2 = (n+1) 2 and it is true for n+1. Now (*) implies that f(n) f(m/n) = f(m), so f(m/n) = m 2 /n 2 for integers m, n. So we have established f(r) = r 2 for all rational r. From (*) above, we have f(x 2 ) = f(x) 2 ≥ 0, so f(x) is always non-negative for positive x and hence for all x. Putting u = y, v = x, we get ( f(x) + f(y) ) 2 = f(x 2 + y 2 ), so f(x 2 + y 2 ) = f(x) 2 + 2f(x)f(y) + f(y) 2 ≥ f(x) 2 = f(x 2 ). For any u > v > 0, we may put u = x 2 + y 2 , v = x 2 and hence f(u) ≥ f(v). In other words, f is an increasing function. So for any x we may take a sequence of rationals r n all less than x we converge to x and another sequence of rationals s n all greater than x which converge to x. Then r n 2 = f(r n ) ≤ f(x) ≤ f(s n ) = s n 2 for all x and hence f(x) = x 2 . 43rd IMO 2002 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 28 Jul 2002 Last corrected/updated 28 Jul 2002"},{"problem":"Given the function y=cos(2x+φ) (-π/2 < φ < π/2), its graph is symmetrical about the line x=π/6.

Given that these numbers form an arithmetic sequence, we have:n_B = n_A + d,n_C = n_A + 2d,where d is the common difference of the arithmetic sequence.Since the sum of the students in all three schools is 1500, we can write:n_A + n_B + n_C = 1500.Substituting the expressions for n_B and n_C in terms of n_A and d, we get:n_A + (n_A + d) + (n_A + 2d) = 1500,3n_A + 3d = 1500.Divide both sides by 3, we obtain:n_A + d = 500.As we need to solve for n_B specifically and we have n_B = n_A + d, it follows that n_B = 500.Since we want to draw a sample of 120 students from all 1500 students, the fraction representing the sample size from school B should be in the same proportion as the fraction of the total number of students from school B.

Find out by how much should the price be reduced per item from the original selling price of 90 yuan so that the store can make a profit of 1200 yuan per day on average from selling this type of clothing, while also ensuring that customers get more benefits.","solution":"To solve this problem, we'll break down the solution into detailed steps:1. Identify Variables and Equations:   - Let x be the reduction in price per item from the original selling price of 90 yuan.   - The new profit per item after the reduction would be the new selling price (90 - x) minus the cost price (50), which gives us a profit per item of (90 - x - 50) yuan.   - The number of items sold per day increases by 2 for every 1 yuan reduction, starting from an initial 20 items per day. So, the number of items sold per day can be represented as (20 + 2x).2. Set Up the Equation for Daily Profit:   - The daily profit is the product of the profit per item and the number of items sold per day. According to the problem, this needs to be 1200 yuan. Therefore, we set up the equation as follows:      (90 - x - 50) cdot (20 + 2x) = 1200   3. Simplify the Equation:   - Simplifying the equation, we distribute and combine like terms:      (40 - x) cdot (20 + 2x) = 1200      - Expanding the left side of the equation:      800 + 80x - 20x - 2x^2 = 1200      - Combining like terms:      -2x^2 + 60x + 800 = 1200      - Moving all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:      -2x^2 + 60x - 400 = 0      - Dividing the entire equation by -2 to simplify:      x^2 - 30x + 200 = 0   4. Solve the Quadratic Equation:   - Solving the quadratic equation x^2 - 30x + 200 = 0, we find the values of x:      x_{1} = 10, quad x_{2} = 20   5. Choose the Appropriate Solution:   - Since the goal is to ensure that customers get more benefits while making a profit of 1200 yuan per day, we choose the larger reduction in price, which is x = 20 yuan.Therefore, the price should be reduced by boxed{20} yuan per item to achieve the desired profit and customer benefit."},{"problem":"Example 8 (2004 Jiangsu Summer Camp) Let S=frac{1}{sqrt{1}+sqrt{2}}+ frac{1}{sqrt{3}+sqrt{4}}+cdots+frac{1}{sqrt{2003}+sqrt{2004}}, find the integer part of S.","solution":"begin{array}{l}text { Sol: For } a>0, b>0,  text { it is easy to prove: } frac{4}{sqrt{a}+sqrt{b}} leqslant frac{1}{sqrt{a}}+frac{1}{sqrt{b}},  text { thus } frac{1}{sqrt{n}+sqrt{n+1}}frac{1}{2}(sqrt{2004}-1)=sqrt{501}-0.5,  text { hence } therefore sqrt{501}-0.5<S<sqrt{501},  therefore 22-0.5<S<23, text { therefore the integer part of } S  text { is } 22.end{array}"},{"problem":"Given the function f(x) = log_{2}(1+frac{2}{x-1}).(1) Use the definition of monotonicity of functions to prove: f(x) is a decreasing function on (1,+infty);(2) If for any x in [3,4], the inequality f(x)-m+1 leqslant 0 always holds, find the range of the real number m.","solution":"(1) Proof: For any x_{1}, x_{2} in (1,+infty) and x_{1}  0, (x_{1}+1)(x_{2}-1) > 0, (x_{1}-1)(x_{2}+1) > 0,  thus x_{1}x_{2}+(x_{2}-x_{1})-1 > x_{1}x_{2}-(x_{2}-x_{1})-1 > 0,then frac{x_{1}x_{2}+(x_{2}-x_{1})-1}{x_{1}x_{2}-(x_{2}-x_{1})-1} > 1,  thus f(x_{1})-f(x_{2}) > 0, i.e., f(x_{1}) > f(x_{2}),  thus f(x) is a decreasing function on (1,+infty);  (2) Solution: Since for any x in [3,4], the inequality f(x)-m+1 leqslant 0 always holds,  thus m-1 geqslant f(x)_{max}, x in [3,4],  from (1), we know that the function f(x) is a decreasing function on [3,4],  thus the maximum value of f(x) on [3,4] is f(x)_{max}=f(3)=1,  thus m-1 geqslant 1, we get m geqslant 2,  thus the range of the real number m is boxed{[2,+infty)}."},{"problem":"Given the set A = {0, 1, log_{3}(x^{2}+2), x^{2}-3x}, if -2 in A, then x = ?","solution":"Since the set A = {0, 1, log_{3}(x^{2}+2), x^{2}-3x} and -2 in A, it follows that x^{2}-3x = -2.

To do this, we will first rewrite (sin x + cos x) as (sqrt{2} sinleft(x + frac{pi}{4}right)) using the trigonometric identity for the sine of a sum of angles.Now, we need to find the values of (x) such that (sqrt{2} sinleft(x + frac{pi}{4}right) in [1, sqrt{2}]). This is equivalent to finding the values of (x+frac{pi}{4}) such that (sinleft(x + frac{pi}{4}right) in left[frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, 1right]).The smallest positive angle where (sinleft(x + frac{pi}{4}right) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}) is (x+frac{pi}{4} = frac{pi}{4}), and the largest angle within the interval where (sinleft(x + frac{pi}{4}right) = 1) is (x+frac{pi}{4} = frac{pi}{2}). Therefore, the sub-interval where (sin x + cos x in [1, sqrt{2}]) is (x in left[0, frac{pi}{4}right]), which has a length of (frac{pi}{4}).Finally, we can calculate the desired probability by dividing the length of the sub-interval by the length of the original interval:frac{frac{pi}{4}}{frac{2pi}{3}} = boxed{frac{3}{4}}"},{"problem":"2.

A critic looks at the artwork and counts faults: each time two red dots are adjacent is one fault, and each time two blue dots are exactly two apart (that is, they have exactly one dot in between them) is another.What is the smallest number of faults the critic could find?","solution":"SolutionPlacing red then blue dots two at a time round the circle (..RRBBRRBB ...), gives 250 'red' faults and no 'blue' faults.It remains to prove that every possible configuration contains at least 250 faults.In every five consecutive dots there must be at least one fault (if any of the middle 3 dots are red, then either that dot has a red neighbour or both its neighbours are blue, both giving a fault; if none of the middle 3 dots are red, then we have 2 blue dots that are 2 apart, giving a fault).Now divide the 1000 dots into blocks of five consecutive dots, each block overlapping by one dot at each end. There are 250 such blocks, each containing at least one fault. Since each fault consist of at least two dots, and blocks overlap by at most one dot, it is impossible to count the same fault in two blocks. Hence, there must be at least 250 faults.A slight variation on this argument is to divide the 1000 dots into non-overlapping blocks of four dots and argue that each such block either contains a fault, which we will call an internal fault, or is R B B R. In the latter case then the dot that comes directly after the block will be the second dot in a red fault if it is red and will be the second dot in a blue fault if it is blue. Either way we have a fault the first of whose dots is in our block, which we call an external fault. Since each of the 250 blocks contributes either an internal or an external fault, there must be at least 250 faults in any configuration.AlternativeThere are various alternative approaches to showing every configuration has at least 250 faults, such as the following: without loss of generality, we may consider a configuration with the minimum number of faults and no more than two consecutive dots the same colour. Indeed, if there are three or more consecutive blue dots, replace one in the middle with a red dot (this doesn't add any faults, and might remove some faults made of two blue dots that are two apart); if there are three or more consecutive red dots, replace one in the middle with a blue dot (this removes two faults made of two adjacent red dots, adds at most two faults made of blue dots two apart). This step increases the number of blocks of consecutive dots of the same colour, so it must terminate after finitely many steps, at which point all such blocks have length at most 2 .Now that all blocks of consecutive dots the same colour have length 1 or 2 , the number of faults equals the number of such blocks of red dots (a block of two red dots has a fault in it; a block of one red dot gives a fault of the two blue dots either side). Since there are at least 500 blocks, of alternating colours, there are at least 250 blocks of red dots, so at least 250 faults."},{"problem":"In triangle ABC, it is given that A=60^{circ}, c= sqrt {3}, b=2 sqrt {3}.

Area Relationship:   - The area of triangle OAB and triangle OAC can be expressed in terms of the area of triangle ABC.   - Since O is the circumcenter, triangle OAB, triangle OAC, and triangle OBC are all sectors of the circumcircle of triangle ABC.   - The area of triangle OAB and triangle OAC are each frac{1}{2} of the area of triangle ABC because O is the circumcenter and divides the triangle into three equal sectors.3.

For Statement ①:- Case 1: When x=0, we observe that frac{1}{2} - 0 = 1 - frac{1}{2}. Since R(0) = R(1) = 0, it implies symmetry about x = frac{1}{2}.- Case 2: For irrational x, 1-x is also irrational. Thus, R(x) = R(1-x) = 0, indicating symmetry about x = frac{1}{2}.- Case 3: For x = frac{p}{q}, where p, q in mathbb{N}_{+} and frac{p}{q} is a reduced proper fraction, we have q > p and p, q are coprime. Since 0  1, leading to a contradiction as p, q would then not be coprime.

However, for n=1, a_{1} = 0 and a_{2} = frac{1}{2}, which means a_{1}  0, we find g(x) is monotonically increasing.

Understanding the Problem:   - We have 10 cities, and some pairs of cities are connected by roads.   - A tour route is a loop that starts from a city, passes exactly 8 out of the other 9 cities exactly once each, and returns to the starting city.   - For each city, there exists a tour route that doesn't pass through the given city.   - We need to find the minimum number of roads on the island.2. Graph Representation:   - Represent the cities as vertices of a graph ( G ) with 10 vertices.   - The roads are the edges of the graph.   - A tour route corresponds to a 9-cycle in the graph that excludes one specific vertex.3. Degree Condition:   - For each vertex ( v ), there must be a 9-cycle that excludes ( v ).   - If a vertex ( v ) has a degree less than 3, it cannot be part of a 9-cycle excluding ( v ) because it would not have enough connections to form such a cycle.   - Therefore, each vertex must have a degree of at least 3.4. Minimum Number of Edges:   - Let ( d(v) ) denote the degree of vertex ( v ).   - By the Handshaking Lemma, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is twice the number of edges: (sum_{v in V} d(v) = 2|E|).   - Since each vertex has a degree of at least 3, we have (sum_{v in V} d(v) geq 3 times 10 = 30).   - Thus, (2|E| geq 30), which implies (|E| geq 15).5. Construction of a Graph with 15 Edges:   - We need to construct a graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges where each vertex has a degree of exactly 3.   - One possible construction is to use a 10-cycle and add 5 additional edges to ensure each vertex has a degree of 3.6.

Expand the numerator:   [   (sqrt{2} + sqrt{a})(sqrt{3} - sqrt{b}) = sqrt{6} - sqrt{2b} + sqrt{3a} - sqrt{ab}   ]5. Therefore, we have:   [   p = frac{sqrt{6} - sqrt{2b} + sqrt{3a} - sqrt{ab}}{3 - b}   ]6. For ( p ) to be rational, the numerator (sqrt{6} - sqrt{2b} + sqrt{3a} - sqrt{ab}) must be an integer multiple of the denominator (3 - b).

Consider the terms involving square roots:   [   sqrt{6}, quad -sqrt{2b}, quad sqrt{3a}, quad -sqrt{ab}   ]   For these terms to combine into a rational number, the coefficients of the square roots must be zero.8.

Similarly, from the condition a^{3} gt b^{3}, it follows directly that a gt b. This is because cubing a real number maintains the sign of the original number, so comparing their cubes is directly comparing the numbers.To explore the sufficiency and necessity of these conditions, we consider examples:- Let's consider a=-2 and b=1.

If this were the case, the side of length 20 would share an endpoint with the side A B (note that C D is the only side of the tetrahedron that does not share endpoints with A B).

Now suppose we rotate the triangle A B D 180 degrees around the line A B. At the end, the point D will have moved to a point D', located on the same side of C relative to the line A B. In this configuration, it is (with some calculation) that C D' < 20. Therefore, during the rotation, there must be a position where the distance between C and D is exactly 20.

To solve the problem, we used the geometric significance of derivatives, the slope formula, and separated a after simplifying the equation. Then, with the help of the constructed function and its derivative, we determined its intervals of monotonicity and maximum value to find the range of a.

Adding these three equations:   [   (x^3 - y) + (y^3 - z) + (z^3 - x) = (z^2 - 2z + 1) + (x^2 - 2x + 1) + (y^2 - 2y + 1)   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - (x + y + z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2(x + y + z) + 3   ]   [   x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - x - y - z = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2x - 2y - 2z + 3   ]   [   x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - x - y - z = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - x - y - z - (x + y + z) + 3   ]   [   x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - x - y - z = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 3(x + y + z) + 3   ]5. Rearranging terms, we get:   [   x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2 + 2(x + y + z) = 3   ]   We can rewrite this as:   [   (x^3 - x^2 + x) + (y^3 - y^2 + y) + (z^3 - z^2 + z) = 3   ]6. Notice that for (x geq 1), (y geq 1), and (z geq 1), each term (x^3 - x^2 + x geq 1), (y^3 - y^2 + y geq 1), and (z^3 - z^2 + z geq 1). Therefore:   [   (x^3 - x^2 + x) + (y^3 - y^2 + y) + (z^3 - z^2 + z) geq 3   ]   Since we have equality, it must be that:   [   x^3 - x^2 + x = 1, quad y^3 - y^2 + y = 1, quad z^3 - z^2 + z = 1   ]7. Solving (x^3 - x^2 + x = 1) for (x geq 1), we find that (x = 1).

The triangle is equilateral if and only if the centroid and orthocenter coincide, i.e.left(frac{a+b+c}{3}, frac{a b+b c+c a}{3}right)=G=H=left(frac{a+b+c+4 a b c}{2},-frac{1}{4}right) .Setting the x and y coordinates equal, we derive the claimed equations.Let lambda be any real number. We are tasked to show thatP(X)=X^{3}-3 lambda cdot X^{2}-frac{3}{4} X+frac{lambda}{4}has three real roots (with multiplicity); then taking those roots as (a, b, c) yields a valid equilateral-triangle triple whose x-coordinate is exactly lambda, be the previous claim.To prove that, pick the valuesbegin{aligned}P(-sqrt{3} / 2) & =-2 lambda P(0) & =frac{1}{4} lambda P(sqrt{3} / 2) & =-2 lambda .end{aligned}The intermediate value theorem (at least for lambda neq 0 ) implies that P should have at least two real roots now, and since P has degree 3 , it has all real roots.

FIRST METHOD.Let n^{2}+2015 n=m^{2}. Denote d= GCD (n, 2015), n=d nu, 2015=d r. Then nu and r are coprime, andd^{2} nu(nu+r)=m^{2}Since nu and nu+r are coprime, each of them must be a square of a natural number, i.e., nu=a^{2}, nu+r=b^{2}. Then r=(b-a)(b+a).a) To obtain some values of n, we can choose d, a, b according to the above scheme. The number d is a divisor of the number 2015=5 cdot 13 cdot 31. For example, let's choose d=1. Then r=2015=(b-a)(b+a). Let b-a=1, b+a=2015. Then b=1008, a=1007, and we get the first value n=a^{2} d=1007^{2}.Now let's take d=31. Then r=65=(b-a)(b+a). Let b-a=5, b+a=13. Then b=9, a=4, n=a^{2} d=496.b) From the above reasoning, it follows that this scheme gives all solutions. Moreover, since d is not divisible by the square of a prime number, different d, a will correspond to different n. Let's count how many different n can be obtained. The number d is a divisor of the number 2015=5 cdot 13 cdot 31. Consider 4 cases:- d=1. Then r=2015=(b-a)(b+a). The number 2015 has 8 different divisors, and thus can be represented in 4 ways as 2015=(b-a)(b+a). (Considering that b-a<b+a). For each such representation, both numbers b-a, b+a are odd, and thus a, b are uniquely determined. Knowing a, b, d, we can uniquely find n=d cdot a^{2}. Thus, in this case, we have 4 different numbers n.- d=5,13 or 31. Then r is the product of two prime numbers and can be represented in the form r=(b-a)(b+a) in two ways. Thus, we have 3 cdot 2=6 answers.- d=65,155 or 403. Then r is a prime number, and can be represented in the form r=(b-a)(b+a) in a unique way. Thus, we have 3 more answers.- d=2015. Then r=1, and the equation r=(b-a)(b+a) is impossible, since a, b are natural numbers.In total, 4+6+3=13 different numbers n.## SECOND METHOD.Let n^{2}+2015 n=m^{2}. Multiplying by 4 and completing the square on the left side, we transform the equation to(2 n+2015)^{2}=4 m^{2}+2015^{2} Rightarrow(2 n-4 m+2015)(2 n+4 m+2015)=2015^{2}Denoting 2 n-4 m+2015=a, 2 n+4 m+2015=b, we get that all sought values of n are determined by the conditionsa<b, a b=2015^{2}, quad n=frac{a+b-2 cdot 2015}{4}a) To obtain some specific values of n, we can take specific factorizations a b=2015^{2}=5^{2} cdot 13^{2} cdot 31^{2}. For example, if a=1, b=2015^{2}, then n=4060226. If a=25 cdot 31, b=169 cdot 31, then n=496.b) Note that for any factorization 2015^{2}=a b, the number n, determined by the equation n=frac{a+b-2 cdot 2015}{4}, is an integer. This follows from the fact that a b=2015^{2} equiv 1(bmod 4), so either a equiv b equiv 1(bmod 4) or a equiv b equiv 3(bmod 4). In both cases, a+b equiv 2 equiv 2 cdot 2015(bmod 4). Thus, the number of sought numbers n is equal to the number of factorizations a b=2015^{2}, a<b. The number 2015^{2} has exactly 27 different divisors. One of them is 2015, and the rest form pairs (a, b), a<b, a b=2015^{2}. Therefore, the number of such pairs is frac{27-1}{2}=13.Criteria.## (-)(-.)

Noting that when left(a_{2}^{prime}, b_{2}^{prime}right)=1, left(b_{2}^{prime}, a_{2}^{prime}-b_{2}^{prime}right)=1, so there exists m in mathbf{Z} such that m b_{2}^{prime} equiv 1left(bmod a_{2}^{prime}-b_{2}^{prime}right), such a determined m satisfies: dleft(a_{2}^{prime}-b_{2}^{prime}right) mid d a_{2}^{prime}left(m b_{2}^{prime}-1right), at this timey-a_{2} equiv 1left(bmod a_{2}-b_{2}right),Therefore, (3) holds.In summary, the maximum value of n that satisfies the conditions is 3."},{"problem":"Given that the total surface area of a rectangular prism is 11, and the sum of all edge lengths is 24, then the length of the body diagonal of this rectangular prism is ______.","solution":"Let's denote the length, width, and height of the rectangular prism as a, b, and c respectively.

How many different transformations result from the sequence of four reflections?","solution":"I. solution. Let us fix a Cartesian coordinate system in the plane of the square such that the sides of the square are parallel to the axes. We will prove that after four reflections, the image of any point Pleft(x_{p} ; y_{p}right) is a translation of the point P by a certain (independent of the position of the point P) vector vec{v}.Let the equation of the side of the square parallel to the x-axis, which we reflect P over first, be y=y_{1}, and the equation of the side we reflect over second be y=y_{2}. Similarly, let the equation of the side of the square parallel to the y-axis, which we reflect over first, be x=x_{1}, and the equation of the side we reflect over second be x=x_{2}. The y-coordinate of the point P changes as follows:begin{aligned}y_{p} & longrightarrow y_{1}+left(y_{1}-y_{p}right)=2 y_{1}-y_{p} longrightarrow & longrightarrow y_{2}+left(y_{2}-left(2 y_{1}-y_{p}right)right)=2 y_{2}-2 y_{1}+y_{p}=y_{p}+2left(y_{2}-y_{1}right)end{aligned}Similarly, the x-coordinate of the point P changes as follows:begin{aligned}x_{p} & longrightarrow x_{1}+left(x_{1}-x_{p}right)=2 x_{1}-x_{p} longrightarrow & longrightarrow x_{2}+left(x_{2}-left(2 x_{1}-x_{p}right)right)=2 x_{2}-2 x_{1}+x_{p}=x_{p}+2left(x_{2}-x_{1}right)end{aligned}Thus, regardless of where the point P is, the four transformations are equivalent to a translation by the vectorvec{v}left(2left(x_{2}-x_{1}right) ; 2left(y_{2}-y_{1}right)right)This vector depends on the order (determined in the coordinates), so there are four possible vectors.Remark. Since the reflection of the point P over the sides of the square parallel to the y-axis (e.g., a, c) only changes the first coordinate, and the reflection over the sides parallel to the x-axis (e.g., b, d) only changes the second coordinate, the reflections in the two different \\"directions\\" are independent of each other. Only the order of reflections over a, c, and over b, d matters.II. solution. We can break the solution into two cases: 1. First, we reflect over two parallel lines. 2. First, we reflect over two perpendicular lines.1. case. The composition of two reflections over parallel lines is equivalent to a translation by twice the distance between the two parallel lines, with the vector pointing from the first line to the second, which in our case is twice the directed side of the square. Therefore, the composition of the four reflections is equivalent to the composition of two translations, whose sum is twice the vector of one of the diagonals. There are four possibilities for this.2. case. The composition of two reflections over perpendicular lines is equivalent to a central reflection, whose center is the intersection of the lines. If we reflect over two pairs of perpendicular lines, it corresponds to two central reflections. The centers can be chosen in two ways (as the endpoints of one of the diagonals), and the distance between them is the diagonal of the square. The composition of two reflections over points is equivalent to a translation by twice the distance between the points. Just like in the first case, this is a translation by twice the vector of one of the diagonals. This case thus gives the same results as the first.In total, there are four different transformations."},{"problem":"The distance from the focus to the asymptote of the hyperbola dfrac {x^{2}}{4}- dfrac {y^{2}}{12}=1 is ( )A: 2B: sqrt {3}C: 3D: 2 sqrt {3}","solution":"From the given equation, we can derive that the coordinates of the foci are (±4,0).

The general period formula for cos(bx+c) is frac{2pi}{|b|}, where b is the coefficient of x in the argument. Here, b = 2, so:- T = frac{2pi}{|2|} = pi.Thus, the minimum positive period is boxed{pi}.For the interval of monotonic decrease, we need to find when the derivative of f(x) is negative.

Within this interval, the cosine function achieves its minimum value at cos(pi) = -1:- Therefore, the minimum value of f(x) on the interval [0, frac{pi}{2}] is sqrt{2}cos(pi) = -sqrt{2}.This minimum value occurs when 2x + frac{pi}{4} = pi, solving for x gives:- 2x = pi - frac{pi}{4} = frac{3pi}{4},- x = frac{3pi}{8}.Therefore, the minimum value of the function f(x) on the interval [0, frac{pi}{2}] is boxed{-sqrt{2}} at boxed{x = frac{3pi}{8}}."},{"problem":"12.

For every pair a<b of them, Vlada writes on the board the largest power of 2 that divides b-a. At most how many distinct powers of 2 could Vlada have written? [i]Proposed by Oleksiy Masalitin[/i]","solution":"1. Define the Problem and Setup:   We are given ( n ge 2 ) distinct positive integers. For every pair ( a < b ) of these integers, we need to determine the largest power of 2 that divides ( b - a ). We aim to find the maximum number of distinct powers of 2 that can be written.2. Graph Representation:   Let ( a_1 < a_2 < ldots < a_n ) be the ( n ) numbers. Consider a graph ( G ) with ( n ) vertices, where each vertex represents one of the ( n ) numbers. Draw an edge between every pair of vertices. The weight of an edge is defined as the largest power of 2 that divides the difference of its vertices.3. Subgraph with Distinct Weights:   Consider a subgraph ( G' ) of ( G ) that has the same vertices as ( G ) and the maximum number of edges with distinct weights. If there are multiple such subgraphs, choose one arbitrarily. We need to prove that ( G' ) has at most ( n-1 ) edges.4. Claim 1: ( G' ) has no cycles.   - Proof:     Suppose ( G' ) contains a cycle. Without loss of generality, let the cycle be ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k, a_1 ) with ( k geq 3 ). Assume the edge between ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ) has the minimal weight among the edges in the cycle. Then, ( a_k - a_1 = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + ldots + (a_k - a_{k-1}) ). Since all weights are distinct, the largest power of 2 dividing ( a_k - a_1 ) must be the same as that dividing ( a_2 - a_1 ), which is a contradiction. Hence, ( G' ) cannot contain any cycles. (blacksquare)5. Claim 2: Any acyclic simple undirected graph on ( n ) vertices has at most ( n-1 ) edges.   - Proof:     We proceed by induction on ( n ).     - Base case: For ( n = 2 ), the graph can have at most 1 edge, which is ( n-1 ).     - Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for graphs with ( n ) vertices. Consider a graph with ( n+1 ) vertices. We need to show there exists a vertex with degree at most 1. Take a maximal path ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_t ) in the graph. Vertex ( v_1 ) has no neighbors among ( v_i ) (for ( i > 2 )), otherwise, a cycle would form. Since the path is maximal, ( v_1 ) can have no neighbor other than ( v_2 ), so ( deg(v_1) = 1 ). Removing ( v_1 ) leaves a subgraph with ( n ) vertices, which by the inductive hypothesis has at most ( n-1 ) edges. Adding back ( v_1 ) and its single edge gives at most ( n ) edges in total. Thus, the graph with ( n+1 ) vertices has at most ( n ) edges. (blacksquare)6. Application to the Problem:   Claims 1 and 2 imply that ( G' ) has at most ( n-1 ) edges. To show that ( n-1 ) distinct powers of 2 are attainable, consider the sequence ( a_1 = 1 ) and ( a_i = 2^i + 1 ) for ( i neq 1 ).

Graph Construction: Construct an undirected graph ( G ) with ( 100! ) vertices, each representing a permutation of the numbers ( 1, 2, ldots, 100 ). Connect two vertices ( tau_1 ) and ( tau_2 ) if it is possible to convert ( tau_1 ) into ( tau_2 ) by swapping two non-adjacent numbers with a difference of 1.2. String Assignment: For each permutation ( tau ), assign a unique string ( S(tau) = s_1s_2 dots s_{99} ) of length 99, consisting of characters ( {<, >} ). The string ( S(tau) ) is defined such that the statements:   [   tau_i ~~s_i ~~tau_{i+1}   ]   are true for ( 1 leq i leq 99 ).3. Claim 1: If ( u ) and ( v ) are connected in ( G ), then ( S(u) = S(v) ).   Proof: Suppose we swap numbers ( m ) and ( m+1 ) to convert ( u ) into ( v ). Since ( m ) is surrounded by numbers either ( geq m+2 ) or ( leq m-1 ), changing ( m ) to ( m+1 ) does not affect ( S(v) ) in that character. Similarly, since ( m+1 ) is surrounded by numbers either ( geq m+2 ) or ( leq m-1 ), ( S(v) ) remains unchanged. This uses the fact that ( m ) and ( m+1 ) are not adjacent. (blacksquare)4. Connected Components: It follows that over each connected component of ( G ), the string ( S(u) ) is fixed. We next show that any two permutations ( tau_1 ) and ( tau_2 ) with the same ( S )-value are in the same connected component.5. Algorithm for Permutation Construction: For each string ( s_1s_2dots s_{99} in {<, >}^{99} ), assign a permutation ( tau(s) ) using the following algorithm:   - Step 1: Initialize a variable ( n = 1 ).   - Step 2: Consider the longest string of ( > ) characters. Suppose it has length ( m ) (this may be zero).   - Step 3: Assign the next ( m+1 ) values unassigned to ( tau ) (in left to right order) the values [m+n, m+n-1, dots, n]   - Step 4: Replace ( n ) with ( n+m+1 ). If ( n geq 101 ), stop. Otherwise, go to Step 2.6. Validity of Algorithm: The above algorithm creates a valid permutation with its ( S )-value being ( s_1s_2 dots s_{99} ).7. Conversion to Target Permutation: Show that each permutation ( sigma ) of ( [100] ) can be converted to ( tauleft(S(sigma)right) ) after a sequence of operations. Fix any permutation ( sigma ) and consider the following:   - If there are two integers ( m ) and ( m+1 ) such that ( m+1 ) appears before ( m ) in ( sigma ) and are not adjacent, swap them.   - Else, stop.8. Termination of Process: The above process cannot go on indefinitely. If it did, some number in ( [100] ) would move back infinitely often, which is impossible since there are only 100 places it could have been in. Thus, we stop at some stage and ( sigma ) becomes some new permutation ( sigma' ).9. Claim 2: ( sigma' equiv tauleft(S(sigma)right) ).   Proof: We will use induction. Let the location of ( 1 ) in the permutation ( sigma' ) be in the ( i )-th position. Now ( 2 ) is either after ( 1 ) or before ( 1 ). Suppose ( 2, 3, dots, m ) all lie to the left of ( 1 ) consecutively with ( m ) maximal. We show that ( sigma' ) starts with ( m ) and thus we may induct down to the permutation after ( 1 ) by shifting all the values down by ( m ). Suppose there are numbers before ( m ) and let ( n ) be the smallest among them. Then ( n-1 ) lies to the right of the ( [m, dots, 1] ) block and we could have swapped ( n ) for ( n-1 ); a contradiction. Thus, we can induct down and prove the claim. (blacksquare)10. Conclusion: With the two claims in hand, it is clear that each connected component of ( G ) is described by the string value each vertex has. It follows that the number of connected components of ( G ) is the number of strings in ( {<, >}^{99} ), which is ( 2^{99} ).The final answer is ( boxed{ 2^{99} } )."},{"problem":"Let (alpha) be an acute angle.

Note that the command +7 allows us to obtain from the current number all larger numbers with the same remainder when divided by seven. Therefore, it is sufficient to use the first two buttons to obtain a representative of each of the seven remainders (0,1, ldots, 6).Initially, we have 1. From 1, we can obtain the number 7 (3 cdot 1 + 4 = 7) - a representative of the remainder 0.

We can rewrite the given equation for circle C as: (x-2)^{2}+y^{2}=9. This indicates the center of the circle is at (2,0) and the radius is 3.(1) The vertical line x=5 is clearly a tangent to circle C as it is a horizontal distance of 3 units from the center (2,0), which is equal to the radius.For the other tangent line passing through (5,1), we assume its equation to be y-1 = k(x-5), which simplifies to kx-y+(1-5k)=0. The perpendicular distance d from the center of the circle to this line must be equal to the radius for it to be a tangent. Therefore, we set up the equation: d = frac{|2k-1+5k|}{sqrt{k^2+1}} = 3. Solving this for k yields k = -frac{4}{3}. Consequently, the equation of the tangent line is: 4x + 3y - 23 = 0. So, the two tangent lines to the circle passing through (5,1) are 4x+3y-23=0 and x=5.(2) Let's denote the points of intersection of the desired line with circle C as A(x_1,y_1) and B(x_2,y_2).

Renaming and Initial Considerations:   - Rename ( N ) to ( n ).   - We need to show that the maximum possible weight of bamboo Panda can get is ( (n-1)^2 ) kilograms.   - For ( n = 1 ), ( M = m ), so ( M - m = 0 ). Hence, the statement holds trivially.   - Assume ( n geq 2 ).2.

Understanding the problem: We need to find how many integers ( n ) in the set ({1, 2, ldots, 100}) satisfy the condition (sigma(n) < n + sqrt{n}), where (sigma(n)) is the sum of the divisors of (n).2. Analyzing the condition for composite numbers: Assume ( n > 1 ) and ( n ) is not a prime number. Then ( n ) has a divisor ( d ) such that ( sqrt{n} le d < n ). We can choose ( d = frac{n}{p} ), where ( p ) is the smallest prime factor of ( n ). 3.

Checking prime numbers and small values:   - For ( n = 1 ):     [     sigma(1) = 1 < 1 + sqrt{1} = 2     ]     So, ( n = 1 ) satisfies the condition.   - For prime numbers ( n ):     [     sigma(n) = 1 + n     ]     We need:     [     1 + n < n + sqrt{n}     ]     Simplifying:     [     1 < sqrt{n}     ]     Squaring both sides:     [     1 < n     ]     So, all prime numbers ( n > 1 ) satisfy the condition.7.

There are 2013 cards with the digit 1 written on them, and 2013 cards with the digit 2 written on them. Vasya forms a 4026-digit number from these cards. In one move, Petya can swap two cards and pay Vasya 1 ruble. The process ends when Petya gets a number divisible by 11. What is the maximum amount Vasya can earn if Petya aims to pay as little as possible?(P. Kozhevnikov)","solution":"Answer: 5 rubles.Solution. Consider a 4026-digit number A, consisting of2013 ones and 2013 twos. Suppose in this number, there are k ones and ell=2013-k twos in the odd positions, then there will be k twos and ell ones in the even positions (here k can take any integer value from 0 to 2013). The difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions is (k+2 ell)-(2 k+ell)=ell-k=2013-2 k. Since 2013 is divisible by 11, the number A is divisible by 11 if and only if k is divisible by 11.In one move, k can change by no more than 1. Therefore, if Vasya initially forms a number A for which, say, k=5 (obviously, this is possible), then, obviously, Petya will need at least 5 moves to change k by 1 to first obtain a number for which k is divisible by 11 (i.e., k=0 or k=11).We will show that, conversely, five moves are always enough for Petya. By swapping a one in an odd position with a two in an even position, he can decrease k by 1 in one move, as long as k neq 0. Similarly, by swapping a two in an odd position with a one in an even position, he can increase k by 1 in one move, as long as k neq 2013. Let the initial number given by Vasya give a remainder r when divided by 11. If r=0, then the initial number is already divisible by 11, and nothing needs to be done. If 1 leqslant r leqslant 5, then in r operations, Petya can decrease k by r to the nearest number divisible by 11. If 6 leqslant r leqslant 10, then in 11-r leqslant 5 operations, Petya can increase k by 11-r to the nearest number divisible by 11 (this is possible because the largest possible value of k=2013 is divisible by 11).Remark. If the boys had n cards with the digits 1 and 2 each, the answer in a similar problem would depend on the remainder of n when divided by 11 - even for large n. For example, if n=2000, then Petya needs to ensure that k has a remainder of 10 when divided by 11; thus, if k=2000 or k=0, Petya might need 10 moves.Therefore, the complete solution to the problem should significantly use the fact that n=2013.Comment. Only the answer - 0 points.An example of a number that cannot be transformed as required in fewer than 5 moves is provided, and it is proven that this number is exactly such - 3 points.It is proven only that from any number, a number divisible by 11 can be obtained in no more than 5 moves - 3 points.If the solution does not use the fact that n=2013 - no more than 5 points.The divisibility rule for 11 can be used without proof."},{"problem":"2.

If we factorize the product into prime factors, this difficulty does not arise.I. Solution: Among the first 100 numbers, there are 50 even numbers, of which 25 are also divisible by 4, 12 by 8, 6 by 16, 3 by 32, and 1 (the number 64 itself) by 64. Thus, the product is divisible by 2 to the power of (50+25+12+6+3+1=) 97. Similarly, we can determine the exponents of the other prime numbers and find that 1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdot ldots cdot 99 cdot 100= 2^{87} cdot 3^{48} cdot 5^{24} cdot 7^{16} cdot 11^{9} cdot 13^{7} cdot 17^{5} cdot 19^{5} cdot 23^{4} cdot 29^{3} cdot 31^{3} cdot 37^{2} cdot 41^{2} cdot 43^{2} cdot 47^{2} cdot 53 cdot 59 cdot 61 cdot 67 cdot 71 cdot 73 cdot 79 cdot 83 cdot 89 cdot 97. By pairing the 5th power with the 2nd power of the same exponent, we get 10^{24}, which, when multiplied, does not change the last digit, so this factor can be omitted. The last digit of the product can be obtained by multiplying only the last digits of the remaining factors, so we can also omit the tens from each individual factor and completely omit the factors ending in 1. Therefore, the last significant digit of the product in question is the same as that of the following product:begin{gathered}2^{73} cdot 3^{48} cdot 7^{16} cdot 3^{7} cdot 7^{5} cdot 9^{5} cdot 3^{4} cdot 9^{3} cdot 7^{2} cdot 3^{2} cdot 7^{2} cdot 3 cdot 9 cdot 7 cdot 3 cdot 9 cdot 3 cdot 9 cdot 7= =2^{73} cdot 3^{86} cdot 7^{27}=16^{18} cdot 2 cdot 81^{21} cdot 3^{2} cdotleft(49^{2}right)^{6} cdot 7^{3}end{gathered}Any power of a number ending in 6 also ends in 6. If we multiply an even number by 6, the last digit does not change. Thus, the last digit of the product of the first two factors is 2. The third factor can be omitted, as can the fifth, because 49^{2} also ends in 1. The last digit of 7^{3} is 3, so the product of the first 100 natural numbers ends in the same digit as 2 cdot 9 cdot 3, which is 4.It is obvious that only the 2 and 5 prime factors played a significant role here, and only until we separated the highest power of 10 by which the product is divisible. After that, the primality of the individual factors was no longer significant, as we replaced some of the ones with the composite number 9. Thus, the prime factorization appears to be a superfluous tool and can indeed be omitted, as shown by the following II. solution.II. Solution: Select separately those factors whose last significant digit is 2 or 5 (including 20 and 50). 20 cdot 50=1000 does not affect the last digit of the product in question, nor does the product of 2 and 5, which can be separated from the selected even factors and the odd factors, respectively. The product of the selected factors is thereforebegin{aligned}& 2 cdot 12 cdot 22 cdot ldots cdot 82 cdot 92 cdot 5 cdot 15 cdot 25 cdot ldots cdot 75 cdot 85 cdot 95 cdot 20 cdot 50= & quad=1 cdot 6 cdot 11 cdot ldots cdot 36 cdot 41 cdot 46 cdot 1 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdot ldots cdot 15 cdot 17 cdot 19 cdot 10^{13}end{aligned}Thus, only two factors ending in 5 remain, the 5 and 15. Multiply these by 36:5 cdot 15 cdot 36=5 cdot 5 cdot 3 cdot 9 cdot 4=2700The other selected factors ending in 1 can be omitted, as can the product of the 6s. It is sufficient to take the last significant digit of the multi-digit numbers, so the product of the selected factors ends in the same digit as7 cdot 6(1 cdot 3 cdot 7 cdot 9)^{2}The last digit of 3 cdot 7 is 1, and so is that of 9^{2}, while 7 cdot 6 ends in 2, so the last digit of this product is 2.We can omit those of the other factors whose last significant digit is 1.

Let f(y)= y^{2}-3 y+2, then the two fixed points of f(y) are 2+sqrt{2} and 2-sqrt{2}. Thus, 2+sqrt{2}, 2-sqrt{2} are also two fixed points of f[f(y)], and the other two fixed points of f[f(y)] are obtained from 1+[1+(y-2+sqrt{2})][1+(y-2-sqrt{2})]=0, i.e., y^{2}-2 y=0, which yields 0 and 2. Therefore, the four roots of the equation are 2+sqrt{2}, 2-sqrt{2}, 0, and 2.This example shows: For a univariate algebraic equation g(x)=0, it can be converted into the equivalent equation f(x)-x= g(x)=0, and by finding the fixed points of f(x), the roots of g(x)=0 can be obtained.The Newton's method for finding approximate roots of higher-order univariate algebraic equations, irrational equations, and transcendental equations is based on the above principle.When using Newton's method to find the approximate root of g(x)=0, a number x_{0} is first appropriately chosen, and then x_{1}=x_{0}- frac{gleft(x_{0}right)}{g^{prime}left(x_{0}right)}, x_{2}=x_{1}-frac{gleft(x_{1}right)}{g^{prime}left(x_{1}right)}, x_{3}=x_{2}-frac{gleft(x_{2}right)}{g^{prime}left(x_{2}right)}, cdots is calculated to obtain a sequence left{x_{i}right}, i= 1,2, cdots (where, g^{prime}(x) is the derivative of g(x)). Depending on the actual needs, a certain x_{i} can be obtained. For example, to solve the equation mathrm{e}^{-frac{x}{4}}(2-x)-1=0, it is known from the graph that g(x)=mathrm{e}^{-frac{x}{4}}(2-x)-1 has a zero point in (0,1). Using Newton's method to find the approximate value of this zero point, we can take x_{0}=3, and havex_{1}=x_{0}-frac{gleft(x_{0}right)}{g^{prime}left(x_{0}right)}=-1.155999, x_{2}=x_{1}-frac{gleft(x_{1}right)}{g^{prime}left(x_{1}right)}=0.189433, x_{3}=x_{2}-frac{gleft(x_{2}right)}{g^{prime}left(x_{2}right)}=0.714043.Depending on the actual needs, a more precise value x_{i} can be obtained, satisfying fleft(x_{i}right)-x_{i}=gleft(x_{i}right) approx 0.

How many purchasing plans are there?  (3) For each green and gray garbage bin purchased, the government will subsidize m yuan and n yuan, respectively. If the costs of all purchasing plans in (2) are the same, find the relationship between m and n.","solution":" Solution:# Part (1): Finding the Purchase Price of Each BinLet's denote the purchase price of each green garbage bin as x yuan and each gray garbage bin as y yuan. From the problem, we have two equations based on the given scenarios:1. Buying 2 green bins and 1 gray bin costs 280 yuan: 2x + y = 280.2. Buying 3 green bins and 2 gray bins costs 460 yuan: 3x + 2y = 460.To solve these equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we'll use elimination:- Multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of y: 4x + 2y = 560.- Subtract the second equation from this result to eliminate y: (4x + 2y) - (3x + 2y) = 560 - 460.- Simplify to find x: x = 100.Substitute x = 100 back into the first equation to find y:- 2(100) + y = 280,- 200 + y = 280,- y = 80.Therefore, the purchase price of each green garbage bin is 100 yuan, and each gray garbage bin is 80 yuan. So, we have boxed{x = 100, y = 80}.# Part (2): Number of Purchasing PlansLet a be the number of green garbage bins purchased, and thus 100 - a is the number of gray garbage bins purchased. The conditions given are:1. The total cost should not exceed 9000 yuan: 100a + 80(100 - a) leq 9000.2. The number of green bins is not less than 80% of the number of gray bins: a geq 0.8(100 - a).Solving the first inequality for a:- 100a + 8000 - 80a leq 9000,- 20a leq 1000,- a leq 50.Solving the second inequality for a:- a geq 80 - 0.8a,- 1.8a geq 80,- a geq 44frac{4}{9}.Since a must be an integer, a can range from 45 to 50, inclusive.

By definition, if overrightarrow{a}⊥overrightarrow{b}, then their dot product equals zero, i.e., overrightarrow{a}⋅overrightarrow{b}=0. Given that both overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} are unit vectors, we have |overrightarrow{a}|^2 = |overrightarrow{b}|^2 = 1. Sufficiency:If overrightarrow{a}⊥overrightarrow{b}, we can explore the implications of this relationship by examining specific combinations of these vectors, such as 2overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b} and overrightarrow{a}+2overrightarrow{b}. We calculate the squares of their magnitudes as follows:- For 2overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b}, we havebegin{align*}|2overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b}|^2 &= 4|overrightarrow{a}|^2 - 4overrightarrow{a}⋅overrightarrow{b} + |overrightarrow{b}|^2 &= 4(1) - 4(0) + 1 &= 5.end{align*}- For overrightarrow{a}+2overrightarrow{b}, similarly, we havebegin{align*}|overrightarrow{a}+2overrightarrow{b}|^2 &= |overrightarrow{a}|^2 + 4overrightarrow{a}⋅overrightarrow{b} + 4|overrightarrow{b}|^2 &= 1 + 4(0) + 4(1) &= 5.end{align*}Hence, we find that |2overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b}|=|overrightarrow{a}+2overrightarrow{b}|, which confirms that if overrightarrow{a}⊥overrightarrow{b}, then our condition is satisfied, proving the sufficiency. Necessity:To prove necessity, we assume |2overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b}|=|overrightarrow{a}+2overrightarrow{b}|. Squaring both sides leads to the equality of their squared magnitudes, which simplifies to overrightarrow{a}⋅overrightarrow{b}=0. This shows that the condition overrightarrow{a}⊥overrightarrow{b} must be true if |2overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b}|=|overrightarrow{a}+2overrightarrow{b}|, thus proving the necessity. Conclusion:Since we've established both the sufficiency and necessity of the condition \\"overrightarrow{a}⊥overrightarrow{b}\\" for the given vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} to satisfy the properties mentioned, we conclude that \\"overrightarrow{a}⊥overrightarrow{b}\\" is a necessary and sufficient condition.

How many ways can this be done so that if two boxes are selected and a card is taken from each, then the knowledge of their sum alone is always sufficient to identify the third box?","solution":"12. Place 1, 2, 3 in different boxes (6 possibilities) and then place n in the same box as its residue mod 3. Or place 1 and 100 in different boxes and 2 - 99 in the third box (6 possibilities). Solution An elegant solution communicated (in outline) by both Mohd Suhaimi Ramly and Fokko J van de Bult is as follows: Let H n be the corresponding result that for cards numbered 1 to n the only solutions are by residue mod 3, or 1 and n in separate boxes and 2 to n - 1 in the third box. It is easy to check that they are solutions. H n is the assertion that there are no others. H 3 is obviously true (although the two cases coincide). We now use induction on n. So suppose that the result is true for n and consider the case n + 1. Suppose n + 1 is alone in its box. If 1 is not also alone, then let N be the sum of the largest cards in each of the boxes not containing n + 1. Since n + 2 ≤ N ≤ n + (n - 1) = 2n - 1, we can achieve the same sum N as from a different pair of boxes as (n + 1) + (N - n - 1). Contradiction. So 1 must be alone and we have one of the solutions envisaged in H n+1 . If n + 1 is not alone, then if we remove it, we must have a solution for n. But that solution cannot be the n, 1, 2 to n - 1 solution. For we can easily check that none of the three boxes will then accomodate n + 1. So it must be the mod 3 solution. We can easily check that in this case n + 1 must go in the box with matching residue, which makes the (n + 1) solution the other solution envisaged by H n+1 . That completes the induction. My much more plodding solution (which I was quite pleased with until I saw the more elegant solution above) follows. It took about half-an-hour and shows the kind of kludge one is likely to come up with under time pressure in an exam! With a suitable labeling of the boxes as A, B, C, there are 4 cases to consider: Case 1: A contains 1; B contains 2; C contains 3 Case 2: A contains 1,2 Case 3: A contains 1, 3; B contains 2 Case 4: A contains 1; B contains 2, 3. We show that Cases 1 and 4 each yield just one possible arrangement and Cases 2 and 3 none. In Case 1, it is an easy induction that n must be placed in the same box as its residue (in other words numbers with residue 1 mod 3 go into A, numbers with residue 2 go into B, and numbers with residue 0 go into C). For (n + 1) + (n - 2) = n + (n - 1). Hence n + 1 must go in the same box as n - 2 (if they were in different boxes, then we would have two pairs from different pairs of boxes with the same sum). It is also clear that this is a possible arrangement. Given the sum of two numbers from different boxes, take its residue mod 3. A residue of 0 indicates that the third (unused) box was C, a residue of 1 indicates that the third box was A, and a residue of 2 indicates that the third box was B. Note that this unique arrangement gives 6 ways for the question, because there are 6 ways of arranging 1, 2 and 3 in the given boxes.In Case 2, let n be the smallest number not in box A. Suppose it is in box B. Let m be the smallest number in the third box, C. m - 1 cannot be in C. If it is in A, then m + (n - 1) = (m - 1) + n. Contradiction (m is in C, n - 1 is in A, so that pair identifies B as the third box, but m - 1 is in A and n is in B, identifying C). So m - 1 must be in B. But (m - 1) + 2 = m + 1. Contradiction. So Case 2 is not possible. In Case 3, let n be the smallest number in box C, so n - 1 must be in A or B. If n - 1 is in A, then (n - 1) + 2 = n + 2. Contradiction (a sum of numbers in A and B equals a sum from C and A). If n - 1 is in B, then (n - 1) + 3 = n + 2. Contradiction ( a sum from B and A equals a sum from C and B). So Case 3 is not possible. In Case 4, let n be the smallest number in box C. n - 1 cannot be in A, or (n - 1) + 2 = 3 + n (pair from A, B with same sum as pair from B, C), so n - 1 must be in B. Now n + 1 cannot be in A (or (n + 1) + 2 = 3 + n), or in B or C (or 1 + (n + 1) = 2 + n). So n + 1 cannot exist and hence n = 100. It is now an easy induction that all of 4, 5, ... 98 must be in B. For given that m is in B, if m + 1 were in A, we would have 100 + m = 99 + (m + 1). But this arrangement (1 in A, 2 - 99 in B, 100 in C) is certainly possible: sums 3 - 100 identify C as the third box, sum 101 identifies B as the third box, and sums 102-199 identify A as the third box. Finally, as in Case 1, this unique arrangement corresponds to 6 ways of arranging the cards in the given boxes. 41st IMO 2000 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 30 Aug 2000 Last corrected/updated 30 Aug 2000"},{"problem":"Points A,B,C and D lie on a line, in that order, with AB = CD and BC = 12.

Let's calculate the probabilities of each of these events and add them up. Arrange the pancakes in the order they are eaten. The probability that the first pancake is with meat is frac{2}{10}. The probability that the last pancake is with meat is the same as the probability that the pancake with meat is in any other position. Therefore, this probability is frac{1}{9}, since after choosing the first pancake, only 9 pancakes remain, one of which is with meat. Thus, the probability that the first and last pancakes are with meat is frac{2}{10} cdot frac{1}{9}=frac{2}{90}. Similarly, we find the probability that the first and last pancakes are with cottage cheese, which is frac{3}{10} cdot frac{2}{9}=frac{6}{90}. And the probability that the first and last pancakes are with strawberries is frac{5}{10} cdot frac{4}{9}=frac{20}{90}. Therefore, the answer to the problem is frac{2}{90}+frac{6}{90}+frac{20}{90}=frac{28}{90}=frac{14}{45}.Remark: The probability that the first and last pancakes are with meat can also be calculated as follows. There are frac{10!}{2!3!5!} ways to arrange our 10 pancakes in a row, and among them, there are frac{8}{3!5!} ways to arrange them in a row so that the pancakes with meat are at the beginning and the end.

The shifted function is:[f(x+a) = ((x+a)-6)^2 cdot sin(omega(x+a))][= (x+a-6)^2 cdot sin(omega x + omega a)]For f(x+a) to be even, f(x+a) = f(-x+a).

For the sine term to contribute to an even function, the argument omega(x+a) must be symmetric around a point, which leads us to set a=6 to align the symmetry with the origin for the sine function's argument.Setting a=6, we get:[sin(omega(x+6)) = sin(omega x + 6omega)]For the function to be even, considering the periodicity and symmetry of the sine function, 6omega must align with points where the sine function's value does not change when the sign of its argument is flipped. This condition is met when:[6omega = frac{pi}{2} + kpi]where k is an integer, representing the general solution for angles where sine has the same value but opposite signs.When k=1, we solve for omega:[6omega = frac{pi}{2} + pi][6omega = frac{3pi}{2}][omega = frac{pi}{4}]Therefore, the possible value of omega that satisfies the condition is omega = frac{pi}{4}.Thus, the correct answer is boxed{C}."},{"problem":"Given a positive integer n, find the largest real number C such that: if the sum of the reciprocals of a set of integers greater than 1 (which can be the same) is less than C, then it is always possible to divide this set of numbers into no more than n groups, such that the sum of the reciprocals of the numbers in each group is less than 1.","solution":"Parse the required C_{text {max }}=frac{n+1}{2}.On one hand, take a set of integers as a_{1}=a_{2}=cdots=a_{k}=2, then it is easy to know C_{text {max }} leqslant frac{n+1}{2}.Below, we use mathematical induction on n to prove that if a set of integers greater than 1, a_{1}, cdots, a_{k}, satisfies sum_{i=1}^{k} frac{1}{a_{i}}<frac{n+1}{2}, then a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{k} can be divided into no more than n groups, such that the sum of the reciprocals in each group is less than 1.

We first prove two lemmas.Lemma 1: For any positive integer mathrm{n}, we have mathrm{b}_{mathrm{n}} leq 2^{mathrm{m}}.Proof of Lemma 1: If there exists b_{n}>2^{m}, let the subsequence of terms in left{b_{n}right} that are greater than 2^{m} be b_{n_{1}}, b_{n_{2}}, ldots. Consider the smallest term in the sequence left{c_{n_{i}}right}, say c_{n_{j}}. Since a_{n_{j}} geq b_{n_{j}}>2^{m}, according to the condition, a_{n_{j}+1}=frac{a_{n_{j}}}{2}=b_{n_{j}} cdot 2^{c_{n_{j}}-1}, which implies b_{n_{j}+1}=b_{n_{j}}>2^{m}, and c_{n_{j}+1}=c_{n_{j}}-1.

That is, there exists a positive integer N, such that for n geq N, we have mathrm{b}_{mathrm{n}}=mathrm{b} as a constant.If a_{n} geq 2^{m}, then a_{n+1} reduces to frac{a_{n}}{2}, so the sequence left{a_{n}right} contains infinitely many terms less than 2 m. Take any positive integer i>N such that a_{i}<2^{m}, then b_{i+1}=b_{i}=b, according to the discussion in Lemma 2, it can only be that b=1, and 2 c_{i}=m Rightarrow c_{i}=frac{m}{2}, thus mathrm{a}_{mathrm{i}}=2^{frac{mathrm{m}}{2}}. Furthermore, according to Lemma 2, left{mathrm{b}_{mathrm{n}}right} is non-decreasing, so for any positive integer mathrm{n}, we have mathrm{b}_{mathrm{n}}=1, that is, every term in the sequence left{mathrm{a}_{mathrm{n}}right} is a power of 2. 2^{m} is a power of 2, thus 2 m-2=m Rightarrow m=2.From the above analysis, mathrm{a}_{1}=mathrm{a} is also a power of 2, let mathrm{a}=2^{mathrm{k}}.

We can therefore further assume that 0 leqq x leqq y. -sin ^{2} alpha:Let us first rewrite both equations of the system using the known formula cos ^{2} alpha=1-begin{aligned}& sin ^{2} x+1-sin ^{2} y=y^{2} & sin ^{2} y+1-sin ^{2} x=x^{2}end{aligned}By adding both equations, we then getx^{2}+y^{2}=2 text {. }By subtracting the second equation from the first, we get2 sin ^{2} x-2 sin ^{2} y=y^{2}-x^{2},or2(sin x+sin y)(sin x-sin y)=y^{2}-x^{2}Given the assumption 0 leqq x leqq y, it follows from (1) that 0 leqq x leqq y leqq leqq sqrt{2}<frac{1}{2} pi, and since the sine function is non-negative and increasing in the interval leftlangle 0, frac{1}{2} piright), we see that for such real numbers x and y, the left side of equation (2) is non-positive, while the right side is non-negative. This means that y^{2}-x^{2}=0, which under the given assumptions gives x=y and together with (1) we have x=y=1.In the domain of non-negative real numbers, the given system of equations has a unique solution, which is (x, y)=(1,1).Conclusion. The given system of equations has exactly four solutions in the domain of real numbers. They are the following pairs: (1,1),(1,-1),(-1,1), and (-1,-1).For a complete solution, award 6 points.

So, we'd like to somehow convert our given expression into a form from which we can apply De Moivre's Theorem.  Recall the [trigonometric identities](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Trigonometric_identities) cos left(frac{pi}2 - uright) = sin u and sin left(frac{pi}2 - uright) = cos u hold for all real u.  If our original equation holds for all t, it must certainly hold for t = frac{pi}2 - u.  Thus, the question is equivalent to asking for how many [positive integers](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Positive_integer) n leq 1000 we have that left(sinleft(fracpi2 - uright) + i cosleft(fracpi 2 - uright)right)^n = sin n left(fracpi2 -u right) + icos n left(fracpi2 - uright) holds for all real u.left(sinleft(fracpi2 - uright) + i cosleft(fracpi 2 - uright)right)^n = left(cos u + i sin uright)^n = cos nu + isin nu.  We know that two [complex numbers](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Complex_number) are equal if and only if both their [real part](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Real_part) and [imaginary part](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Imaginary_part) are equal.  Thus, we need to find all n such that cos n u = sin nleft(fracpi2 - uright) and sin nu = cos nleft(fracpi2 - uright) hold for all real u.sin x = cos y if and only if either x + y = frac pi 2 + 2pi cdot k or x - y = fracpi2 + 2picdot k for some integer k.  So from the equality of the real parts we need either nu + nleft(fracpi2 - uright) = fracpi 2 + 2pi cdot k, in which case n = 1 + 4k, or we need -nu + nleft(fracpi2 - uright) = fracpi 2 + 2pi cdot k, in which case n will depend on u and so the equation will not hold for all real values of u.  Checking n = 1 + 4k in the equation for the imaginary parts, we see that it works there as well, so exactly those values of n congruent to 1 pmod 4 work.  There are boxed{250} of them in the given range.Solution 2This problem begs us to use the familiar identity e^{it} = cos(t) + i sin(t). Notice, sin(t) + i cos(t) = i(cos(t) - i sin(t)) = i e^{-it} since sin(-t) = -sin(t). Using this, (sin(t) + i cos(t))^n = sin(nt) + i cos(nt) is recast as (i e^{-it})^n = i e^{-itn}. Hence we must have i^n = i Rightarrow i^{n-1} = 1 Rightarrow n equiv 1 bmod{4}. Thus since 1000 is a multiple of 4 exactly one quarter of the residues are congruent to 1 hence we have boxed{250}.Solution 3We can rewrite sin(t) as cosleft(frac{pi}{2}-tright) and cos(t) as sinleft(frac{pi}{2}-tright). This means that sin t + icos t = e^{ileft(frac{pi}{2}-tright)}=frac{e^{frac{pi i}{2}}}{e^{it}}. This theorem also tells us that e^{frac{pi i}{2}}=i, so sin t + icos t = frac{i}{e^{it}}. By the same line of reasoning, we have sin nt + icos nt = frac{i}{e^{int}}.For the statement in the question to be true, we must have left(frac{i}{e^{it}}right)^n=frac{i}{e^{int}}. The left hand side simplifies to frac{i^n}{e^{int}}. We cancel the denominators and find that the only thing that needs to be true is that i^n=i. This is true if nequiv1pmod{4}, and there are boxed{250} such numbers between 1 and 1000. Solution by ZeromanSolution 4We are using degrees in this solution instead of radians. I just process stuff better that way.We can see that the LHS is cis(n(90^{circ}-t)), and the RHS is cis(90^{circ}-nt) So, n(90-t) equiv 90-nt mod 360 Expanding and canceling the nt terms, we will get 90n equiv 90 mod 360. Canceling gets n equiv 1 mod 4, and thus there are boxed{250} values of n.-AlexLikeMathSolution 5(CHEAP)Let t=0. Then, we have i^n=i which means nequiv 1pmod{4}. Thus, the answer is boxed{250}.Solution 6We factor out i^n from (sin t + i cos t)^n = i^n (cos(t) - i sin t)= i^n(cos(nt) - isin nt). We know the final expression must be the same as sin nt + i cos nt so we must have i^n(cos(nt) - isin nt) = sin nt + i cos nt in which testing yields n equiv 1 pmod{4} is the only mod that works, so we have a total of 1000 cdotfrac{1}{4} = boxed{250} integers n that work."},{"problem":"1.

Since |Q A|=|Q B|, and triangle Q A B has the same area as triangle P A B, point Q lies on the y-axis, with the same y-coordinate as P.

The problem is equivalent to determining the positive integer n, such that the congruence1+2+3+cdots+x=a(bmod n)has solutions for a=0,1,2, cdots, n-1 (which is actually equivalent to having solutions for any integer a).Try special values of n and examine whether 1+2+3+cdots+x modulo n can cover a complete residue system modulo n.When n=2, 1 equiv 1(bmod 2), 1+2 equiv 1(bmod 2), 1+2+3 equiv 0(bmod 2), so n=2 satisfies the requirement.When n=3, 1=1(bmod 3), 1+2 equiv 0(bmod 3), 1+2+3 equiv 0(bmod 3), it is easy to see that as the positive integer x increases, 1+2+3+cdots+x modulo 3 is a periodic sequence with a period of 1,0,0, so n=3 does not satisfy the requirement.When n=4, 1=1(bmod 4) cdot 1+2 equiv 3(bmod 4), 1+2+3 equiv 2(bmod 4), 1+2+3+4 equiv 2(bmod 4), 1+2+3+4+5 equiv 3(bmod 4), 1+2+3+4+5+6 equiv 1(bmod 4), 1+2+3+4+5+6+7 equiv 0(bmod 4), from which it can be seen that 1+2+3+cdots+x modulo 4 covers a complete residue system 0,1,2,3, so n=4 satisfies the requirement.When n=5, 1 equiv 1(bmod 5), 1+2 equiv 3(bmod 5), 1+2+3 equiv 1(bmod 5), 1+2+3+4 equiv 0(bmod 5), 1+2+3+4+5 equiv 0(bmod 5), the subsequent remainders will inevitably repeat. So n=5 does not satisfy the requirement.Similarly, it can be seen that n=6,7,9,10 do not satisfy the requirement, while n=8 does satisfy the requirement.Thus, it is conjectured that n is a power of 2, i.e., n=2^{k}(k in mathbf{N}), when each of the n students can receive candy.The next question is: How to prove this conjecture is true?Re-examine the analysis process of special cases, it is not difficult to find that when n=3,5,7, the remainders of 1+2+3+cdots+x modulo n are a very simple cycle. Thus, the following auxiliary conjecture can be made.Conjecture When n is an odd prime p, there must exist an integer a such that (1) has no solution.The following proves that this auxiliary conjecture is true.Consider the first p values of 1+2+3+cdots+x1.1+2,1+2+3, cdots, 1+2+cdots+(p-1), 1+2+3 cdots+(p-1)+p,Since p is an odd prime, we get1+2+cdots+(p-1)+p=frac{p(p+1)}{2} equiv 0(bmod p),so1+2+cdots+(p-1) equiv 1+2+cdots+(p-1)+p equiv 0(bmod p) .Therefore, the p numbers in (2) have at most p-1 different values modulo p, and the remainders of 1+2+3+cdots+x modulo p are all periodic, hence there must exist an integer a such that (1) has no solution.Furthermore, when n has an odd prime factor p, if the congruence (1) has solutions for any integer a, then the congruence1+2+3+cdots+x=a(bmod p)must also have solutions for any integer a, but this is impossible according to the auxiliary conjecture. Therefore, when n has an odd prime factor p, the congruence (1) must have cases with no solution. Thus, to make the congruence (1) have solutions for any integer a, n can only be a power of 2.Next, it needs to be proven that when n=2^{k}left(k in mathbf{N}_{+}right), the congruence (1) indeed has solutions for any integer a. For this, it is only necessary to construct 2^{k} integers that are pairwise incongruent modulo 2^{k}, such that frac{x(x+1)}{2} can take each of these integers. In fact, the following 2^{k} integers meet the requirement (proof omitted).frac{0 times 1}{2}, frac{1 times 2}{2}, frac{2 times 3}{2}, cdots, frac{left(2^{k}-1right) cdot 2^{k}}{2}Note Sometimes, the conclusion of a proposition is not clear, making it difficult to solve the problem.

Simplify (Delta):   - Start by expressing (Delta) in terms of (a_i):     [     Delta = frac{sum_{i=1}^4 a_i^2}{4} - a^2     ]   - Since ( a = frac{a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4}{4} ), we have:     [     Delta = frac{sum_{i=1}^4 a_i^2}{4} - left(frac{a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4}{4}right)^2     ]   - Expand and simplify:     [     Delta = frac{sum_{i=1}^4 a_i^2}{4} - frac{(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4)^2}{16}     ]     [     Delta = frac{sum_{i=1}^4 a_i^2}{4} - frac{sum_{i=1}^4 a_i^2 + 2sum_{1 leq i < j leq 4} a_i a_j}{16}     ]     [     Delta = frac{4sum_{i=1}^4 a_i^2 - sum_{i=1}^4 a_i^2 - 2sum_{1 leq i < j leq 4} a_i a_j}{16}     ]     [     Delta = frac{3sum_{i=1}^4 a_i^2 - 2sum_{1 leq i < j leq 4} a_i a_j}{16}     ]     [     Delta = frac{1}{4} sum_{i=1}^4 (a_i - a)^2     ]5. Analyze the distinct integers (d_i = a_i - a):   - Let ( d_i = a_i - a ) for ( 1 leq i leq 4 ). These are four distinct integers summing to zero:     [     sum_{i=1}^4 d_i = 0     ]   - Assume none of them is zero. Then:     [     Delta geq frac{1}{4}((-2)^2 + (-1)^2 + 1^2 + 2^2) = frac{1}{4}(4 + 1 + 1 + 4) = frac{10}{4} = frac{5}{2}     ]6. Consider the case where one of them is zero:   - If one of (d_i) is zero, the remaining three must sum to zero. Check that no three numbers from ({-2, -1, 1, 2}) sum to zero. Hence:     [     Delta geq frac{1}{4}(3^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = frac{1}{4}(9 + 1 + 1) = frac{11}{4} > frac{5}{2}     ]7. Conclusion:   - Since (Delta geq frac{5}{2}) in all cases, after 30 steps, the mean of the squares of the integers on the board is:     [     frac{b_1^2 + b_2^2 + b_3^2 + cdots + b_n^2}{n} geq 44^2 + 30 cdot frac{5}{2} = 1936 + 75 = 2011     ]The final answer is (boxed{2011})"},{"problem":"In triangle triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C are a, b, c respectively, and frac{1}{2}sin2Bcos C + cos^2 B sin C - sinfrac{A}{2}cosfrac{A}{2} = 0.

Determine r if B, M and N are collinear.","solution":"For an inelegant solution one can use coordinates. The advantage of this type of approach is that it is quick and guaranteed to work! Take A as (0,√3), B as (1,√3), C as (3/2,√3/2, D as (1,0). Take the point X, coordinates (x,0), on ED. We find where the line BX cuts AC and CE. The general point on BX is (k + (1- k)x,k√3). If this is also the point M with AM/AC = r then we have: k + (1-k)x = 3r/2, k√3 = (1-r)√3 + r√3/2. Hence k = 1 - r/2, r = 2/(4-x). Similarly, if it is the point N with CN/CE = r, then k + (1-k)x = 3(1- r)/2, k√3 = (1-r)√3/2. Hence k = (1-r)/2 and r = (2-x)/(2+x). Hence for the ratios to be equal we require 2/(4-x) = (2-x)/(2+x), so x 2 - 8x + 4 = 0. We also have x < 1, so x = 4 - √12. This gives r = 1/√3.

Use the Double Angle Formula: We then use the double angle formula for cosine, which is cos(2theta) = 2sin^2(theta) - 1, on the angle alpha + frac{pi}{6}:   [   -cosleft(2left(alpha + frac{pi}{6}right)right) = 2sin^2left(alpha + frac{pi}{6}right) - 1   ]   Given that sinleft(alpha + frac{pi}{6}right) = frac{1}{3}, we substitute this value into the equation.4.

Simplify the expression:   - Multiply 2times frac{sqrt{2}}{2} to get sqrt{2}.   - Combine like terms: 1 - 3 + sqrt{2} + 5.4.

Solution We show first that there is always a chord length 1/n. For n = 1, this is obvious, so assume n > 1. Define g(x) = f(x + 1/n) - f(x) for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 - 1/n. We have to find a zero for g(x). Consider the n values g(0), g(1/n), g(2/n), ... , g((n-1)/n). If any of them are zero we are home. So assume they are all non-zero. Their sum is f(1) - f(0) = 0, so some must be negative and some positive. But g is continuous, so it must assume the intermediate value 0. Conversely, we construct a function which does not have any chords with lengths in the interval (1/(n+1), 1/n). We take a piecewise linear function such as that shown. All segments are in one of two directions. The horizontal distance between adjacent parallel lines of one set is DE, the horizontal distance for the other set is AC. The idea is that there are no horizontal lines with lengths between DE and AC. We choose the slope of the dotted lines so that AB = DE. The result is now clear from the diagram. We need A to be (0,0) and X to be (1,0). It is convenient to take the lines to have slopes ±1. Then the first peak has height AB/2. The second peak is BC/2 lower. So we need AB to be a multiple of BC. Suppose we take AB/BC = n. It is clear from the diagram that AX = nAC, so AC = 1/n. Hence AB = 1/(n+1), and BC = 1/(n(n+1)).

Then P H is both the perpendicular bisector of segment A C and the perpendicular bisector of B D, making it the height of the pyramid, and point M lies on P H. Thus, the plane P B D is perpendicular to the base plane A B C D, and similarly, the plane P A C is also perpendicular to the base plane A B C D. The plane P B D divides the pyramid into two equal-volume tetrahedrons, so we only need to consider the tetrahedron P A B D.Let the projection of point M on the plane P A D be E, and the plane M E H passes through point P and intersects A D at F. Since angle M H F=90^{circ}=angle M E F, points M, E, F, H are concyclic. Because M E perp plane P A D, we have M E perp A D. Since M H perp plane A B D, we have M H perp A D. Therefore, A D perp plane M E H, so A D perp P F, and F H is the projection of P F in the plane A B D. Thus, A D perp F H, and the dihedral angle angle E F H=60^{circ}. Therefore, angle E M H=120^{circ}.Given M E=M H=1, we get E H=sqrt{3}. In the right triangles M E F and M H F, E F=H F.

Take 35 equally spaced points around the circle and place 5 birds at each of 15 points and 4 birds at the other 20 points. Only birds at the same point are mutually visible, so there are 15.10 + 20.6 = 270 mutually visible pairs. Suppose bird P is at A and bird Q is at B, where A and B are distinct but ∠AOB ≤ 10 o . Suppose that h birds are visible from A not B, and that k birds are visible from B not A. Without loss of generality h ≤ k. Now suppose all the birds at B move to A. Then the number of mutually visible pairs will not increase. By repeating this operation, we get to a configuration where two birds can see each other only if they are at the same point.

Thus the minimum is attained when 20 values equal 4 and 15 values equal 5. 30th IMO shortlist 1989 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 28 Dec 2002 Last corrected/updated 28 Dec 02"},{"problem":"Compute: frac{3-i}{1+i}=______ noindent.","solution":"First, we rationalize the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:frac{3-i}{1+i} = frac{(3-i)(1-i)}{(1+i)(1-i)} = frac{3 - 3i - i + i^2}{1 - i + i - i^2}.Next, we simplify the expression using the property that i^2 = -1:frac{3 - 3i - i + i^2}{1 - i + i - i^2} = frac{3 - 4i + (-1)}{1 - (-1)} = frac{2 - 4i}{2}.Finally, we divide both the real and imaginary parts by 2:frac{2 - 4i}{2} = 1 - 2i.So, the answer is: boxed{1 - 2i}.This problem involves performing arithmetic operations with complex numbers in algebraic form, specifically multiplication and division.

Find the smallest base  b>1 for which there is a perfect cube of the form  xyxy in base  b.","solution":"1. Show that no integer of the form xyxy in base 10 can be a perfect cube.   An integer of the form xyxy in base 10 can be written as:   [   overline{xyxy} = 1000x + 100y + 10x + y = 1010x + 101y = 101(10x + y)   ]   Assume that overline{xyxy} is a perfect cube. Then, since 101 is a prime number, for overline{xyxy} to be a perfect cube, 101 must divide 10x + y. However, 10x + y is a two-digit number, and the maximum value it can take is 99. Since 101 > 99, 101 cannot divide 10x + y. Therefore, overline{xyxy} cannot be a perfect cube in base 10.2. Find the smallest base b > 1 for which there is a perfect cube of the form xyxy in base b.   An integer of the form xyxy in base b can be written as:   [   overline{xyxy}_b = xb^3 + yb^2 + xb + y = (xb + y)(b^2 + 1)   ]   We need (xb + y)(b^2 + 1) to be a perfect cube. Consider two cases:   Case 1: b^2 + 1 is square-free (i.e., it has no repeated prime factors).   For (xb + y)(b^2 + 1) to be a cube, (b^2 + 1)^2 must divide xb + y. However, xb + y < 2b^2 < (b^2 + 1)^2, which is a contradiction. Therefore, b^2 + 1 must not be square-free.   Case 2: b^2 + 1 is not square-free.   We need to find the smallest b such that b^2 + 1 is not square-free. Checking small values of b:   - For b = 2: b^2 + 1 = 5 (square-free)   - For b = 3: b^2 + 1 = 10 (square-free)   - For b = 4: b^2 + 1 = 17 (square-free)   - For b = 5: b^2 + 1 = 26 (square-free)   - For b = 6: b^2 + 1 = 37 (square-free)   - For b = 7: b^2 + 1 = 50 = 2 times 5^2 (not square-free)   Therefore, the smallest b such that b^2 + 1 is not square-free is b = 7.   When b = 7, we have:   [   overline{xyxy}_7 = (7x + y)(7^2 + 1) = (7x + y)(50)   ]   We need (7x + y)(50) to be a perfect cube. Checking small values of x and y, we find:   [   (7 times 2 + 6)(7^2 + 1) = (14 + 6)(50) = 20 times 50 = 1000 = 10^3   ]   Therefore, 1000 is a perfect cube, and the smallest base b for which there is a perfect cube of the form xyxy is b = 7.The final answer is boxed{7}."},{"problem":"We select two points independently at random on the interval (0,1) of the number line.

According to the conditions of the problem, the point P corresponding to the pair (x, y) is selected from the square N defined by 0 leqq x leqq 1, 0 leqq y leqq 1 in the coordinate plane, according to a geometric distribution. This means that the probability that P falls into some subset A of N is equal to the area of A.The distance between the chosen numbers in the original (0,1) interval is equal to the absolute difference |x-y| of the x and y coordinates of the point P. This is less than h ifx-h < y < x+hIf 0 < h < 1, the points of N that satisfy the inequality (1) form the set A, which is obtained from N by cutting off the (1-h)-sided isosceles right triangles from the corners (1; 0) and (0; 1). Therefore, the area of A is1 - (1-h)^2 = h(2-h)and this is also the probability of the event (1).According to the problem, this probability lies between 1/4 and 3/4, sofrac{1}{4} < (1-h)^2 < frac{3}{4}which means that the number h lies between frac{1}{2} and 1 - frac{sqrt{3}}{2}.Páles Zsolt (Sátoraljaújhely, Kossuth L.
