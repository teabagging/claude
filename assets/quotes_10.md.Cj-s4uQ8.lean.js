Let the segments be denoted as S_1, S_2, ldots, S_{100}.   - The sergeant permutes these segments, forming a new line. Let this permutation be denoted by sigma, where sigma is a permutation of {1, 2, ldots, 100}.   - This procedure is repeated several times, each time splitting the new line into segments of the same lengths and permuting them in the same way.2. Tracking the Soldiers:   - Consider a soldier originally in the first segment S_1. We need to determine the number of iterations it takes for this soldier to return to the first segment S_1 for the first time.   - Let T_i be the number of iterations it takes for the i-th soldier in S_1 to return to S_1.3. Cycle Structure of the Permutation:   - The permutation sigma of the segments can be decomposed into disjoint cycles. Each cycle represents a sequence of segments that map into each other under the permutation sigma.   - Let the lengths of these cycles be c_1, c_2, ldots, c_k where c_1 + c_2 + cdots + c_k = 100.4. Return to Original Segment:   - A soldier in a segment that is part of a cycle of length c_i will return to the original segment after c_i iterations.   - Therefore, the number of iterations it takes for a soldier to return to the first segment S_1 is determined by the length of the cycle that S_1 is part of.5. Number of Different Return Times:   - Since there are 100 segments and the permutation sigma can be decomposed into cycles whose lengths sum to 100, there can be at most 100 different cycle lengths.   - Each cycle length corresponds to a different return time for the soldiers in the segments that are part of that cycle.6.

There are 7 events of each type, but one (MM*) is counted twice. Therefore, there are 27 events in total, and all are equally likely. Out of these, 14 events involve a girl, which leads to the result. It is somewhat surprising that the day of the week on which the boy was born changes the probability of a mixed-gender pair. This idea is somewhat unexpected, I agree."},{"problem":"A certain university has 120 full professors, 100 associate professors, 80 lecturers, and 60 teaching assistants.

Two-digit hyperprimes:   For a two-digit number or higher, we need to ensure that all segments of the number are prime. Let's consider the possible combinations:   - The digits 2 and 5 can only exist as the leftmost digit of the number because any segment starting with 2 or 5 must be prime.   - The part of the number after the first digit must also be a hyperprime.4. Hyperprimes consisting of only 3's and 7's:   - We cannot have two consecutive 3's or two consecutive 7's, since neither 33 nor 77 is prime.   - Therefore, the number must alternate 3's and 7's.   - We also cannot have more than one 7 because then the segment 737 = 11 cdot 67 is not prime.

Therefore, to get a sum of digits equal to an even number n, we need to take a number whose decimal representation consists of frac{n}{2} groups of digits 1001. Accordingly, to get a sum of digits equal to an odd number 2n+1, we need to take a number whose decimal representation consists of frac{n}{2}-1 groups of digits 1001 and one group of digits 21. A sum of digits equal to 1 cannot be obtained, because powers of ten are not divisible by 7."},{"problem":"8.

We begin with an example showing that there can exist 3986729 cells carrying the same positive number. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_481ddb3576adc2313a2eg-40.jpg?height=577&width=580&top_left_y=1022&top_left_x=744) To describe it, we number the columns from the left to the right and the rows from the bottom to the top by 1,2, ldots, 2011. We will denote each napkin by the coordinates of its lowerleft cell. There are four kinds of napkins: first, we take all napkins (52 i+36,52 j+1) with 0 leq j leq i leq m-2; second, we use all napkins (52 i+1,52 j+36) with 0 leq i leq j leq m-2; third, we use all napkins (52 i+36,52 i+36) with 0 leq i leq m-2; and finally the napkin (1,1). Different groups of napkins are shown by different types of hatchings in the picture. Now except for those squares that carry two or more different hatchings, all squares have the number 1 written into them. The number of these exceptional cells is easily computed to be left(52^{2}-35^{2}right) m-17^{2}=57392. We are left to prove that 3986729 is an upper bound for the number of cells containing the same number. Consider any configuration of napkins and any positive integer M. Suppose there are g cells with a number different from M. Then it suffices to show g geq 57392. Throughout the solution, a line will mean either a row or a column. Consider any line ell. Let a_{1}, ldots, a_{52 m-17} be the numbers written into its consecutive cells. For i=1,2, ldots, 52, let s_{i}=sum_{t equiv i(bmod 52)} a_{t}. Note that s_{1}, ldots, s_{35} have m terms each, while s_{36}, ldots, s_{52} have m-1 terms each. Every napkin intersecting ell contributes exactly 1 to each s_{i}; hence the number s of all those napkins satisfies s_{1}=cdots=s_{52}=s. Call the line ell rich if s>(m-1) M and poor otherwise. Suppose now that ell is rich. Then in each of the sums s_{36}, ldots, s_{52} there exists a term greater than M; consider all these terms and call the corresponding cells the rich bad cells for this line. So, each rich line contains at least 17 cells that are bad for this line. If, on the other hand, ell is poor, then certainly s<m M so in each of the sums s_{1}, ldots, s_{35} there exists a term less than M; consider all these terms and call the corresponding cells the poor bad cells for this line. So, each poor line contains at least 35 cells that are bad for this line. Let us call all indices congruent to 1,2, ldots, or 35 modulo 52 small, and all other indices, i.e. those congruent to 36,37, ldots, or 52 modulo 52, big. Recall that we have numbered the columns from the left to the right and the rows from the bottom to the top using the numbers 1,2, ldots, 52 m-17; we say that a line is big or small depending on whether its index is big or small. By definition, all rich bad cells for the rows belong to the big columns, while the poor ones belong to the small columns, and vice versa. In each line, we put a strawberry on each cell that is bad for this line. In addition, for each small rich line we put an extra strawberry on each of its (rich) bad cells. A cell gets the strawberries from its row and its column independently. Notice now that a cell with a strawberry on it contains a number different from M. If this cell gets a strawberry by the extra rule, then it contains a number greater than M. Moreover, it is either in a small row and in a big column, or vice versa. Suppose that it is in a small row, then it is not bad for its column. So it has not more than two strawberries in this case. On the other hand, if the extra rule is not applied to some cell, then it also has not more than two strawberries. So, the total number N of strawberries is at most 2 g. We shall now estimate N in a different way. For each of the 2 cdot 35 m small lines, we have introduced at least 34 strawberries if it is rich and at least 35 strawberries if it is poor, so at least 34 strawberries in any case. Similarly, for each of the 2 cdot 17(m-1) big lines, we put at least min (17,35)=17 strawberries.

Alice is given a rational number r>1 and a line with two points B not R, where point R contains a red bead and point B contains a blue bead. Alice plays a solitaire game by performing a sequence of moves. In every move, she chooses a (not necessarily positive) integer k, and a bead to move. If that bead is placed at point X, and the other bead is placed at Y, then Alice moves the chosen bead to point X^{prime} with overrightarrow{Y X^{prime}}=r^{k} overrightarrow{Y X}.Alice's goal is to move the red bead to the point B. Find all rational numbers r>1 such that Alice can reach her goal in at most 2021 moves.","solution":"Answer: All r=(b+1) / b with b=1, ldots, 1010.Solution. Denote the red and blue beads by mathcal{R} and mathcal{B}, respectively. Introduce coordinates on the line and identify the points with their coordinates so that R=0 and B=1. Then, during the game, the coordinate of mathcal{R} is always smaller than the coordinate of mathcal{B}. Moreover, the distance between the beads always has the form r^{ell} with ell in mathbb{Z}, since it only multiplies by numbers of this form. Denote the value of the distance after the m^{text {th }} move by d_{m}=r^{alpha_{m}}, m=0,1,2, ldots (after the 0^{text {th }} move we have just the initial position, so alpha_{0}=0 ).If some bead is moved in two consecutive moves, then Alice could instead perform a single move (and change the distance from d_{i} directly to d_{i+2} ) which has the same effect as these two moves. So, if Alice can achieve her goal, then she may as well achieve it in fewer (or the same) number of moves by alternating the moves of mathcal{B} and mathcal{R}. In the sequel, we assume that Alice alternates the moves, and that mathcal{R} is shifted altogether t times.If mathcal{R} is shifted in the m^{text {th }} move, then its coordinate increases by d_{m}-d_{m+1}. Therefore, the total increment of mathcal{R} 's coordinate, which should be 1 , equalseitherbegin{array}{l}left(d_{0}-d_{1}right)+left(d_{2}-d_{3}right)+cdots+left(d_{2 t-2}-d_{2 t-1}right)=1+sum_{i=1}^{t-1} r^{alpha_{2 t}}-sum_{i=1}^{t} r^{alpha_{2 i-1}}, left(d_{1}-d_{2}right)+left(d_{3}-d_{4}right)+cdots+left(d_{2 t-1}-d_{2 t}right)=sum_{i=1}^{t} r^{alpha_{2 lambda-1}}-sum_{i=1}^{t} r^{alpha_{2 i}},end{array}depending on whether mathcal{R} or mathcal{B} is shifted in the first move. Moreover, in the former case we should have t leqslant 1011, while in the latter one we need t leqslant 1010. So both cases reduce to an equationsum_{i=1}^{n} r^{beta_{i}}=sum_{i=1}^{n-1} r^{gamma_{i}}, quad beta_{i}, gamma_{i} in mathbb{Z},for some n leqslant 1011. Thus, if Alice can reach her goal, then this equation has a solution for n=1011 (we can add equal terms to both sums in order to increase n ).Conversely, if (1) has a solution for n=1011, then Alice can compose a corresponding sequence of distances d_{0}, d_{1}, d_{2}, ldots, d_{2021} and then realise it by a sequence of moves. So the problem reduces to the solvability of (1) for n=1011.Assume that, for some rational r, there is a solution of (1). Write r in lowest terms as r=a / b. Substitute this into (1), multiply by the common denominator, and collect all terms on the left hand side to getsum_{i=1}^{2 n-1}(-1)^{i} a^{mu_{i}} b^{N-mu_{i}}=0, quad mu_{i} in{0,1, ldots, N},for some N geqslant 0. We assume that there exist indices j_{-}and j_{+}such that mu_{j_{-}}=0 and mu_{j_{+}}=N.Reducing (2) modulo a-b (so that a=b ), we get0=sum_{i=1}^{2 n-1}(-1)^{i} a^{mu_{i}} b^{N-mu_{i}}=sum_{i=1}^{2 n-1}(-1)^{i} b^{mu_{i}} b^{N-mu_{i}}=-b^{N} quad bmod (a-b) .Since operatorname{gcd}(a-b, b)=1, this is possible only if a-b=1.Reducing (2) modulo a+b (so that a=-b ), we get0=sum_{i=1}^{2 n-1}(-1)^{i} a^{mu_{i}} b^{N-mu_{i}}=sum_{i=1}^{2 n-1}(-1)^{1}(-1)^{mu_{i}} b^{mu_{i}} b^{N-mu_{i}}=S b^{N} quad bmod (a+b)for some odd (thus nonzero) S with |S| leqslant 2 n-1. Since operatorname{gcd}(a+b, b)=1, this is possible only if a+b mid S. So a+b leqslant 2 n-1, and hence b=a-1 leqslant n-1=1010.Thus we have shown that any sought r has the form indicated in the answer. It remains to show that for any b=1,2, ldots, 1010 and a=b+1, Alice can reach the goal. For this purpose, in (1) we put n=a, beta_{1}=beta_{2}=cdots=beta_{a}=0, and gamma_{1}=gamma_{2}=cdots=gamma_{b}=1.Comment 1. Instead of reducing modulo a+b, one can reduce modulo a and modulo b. The first reduction shows that the number of terms in (2) with mu_{i}=0 is divisible by a, while the second shows that the number of terms with mu_{i}=N is divisible by b.Notice that, in fact, N>0, as otherwise (2) contains an alternating sum of an odd number of equal terms, which is nonzero. Therefore, all terms listed above have different indices, and there are at least a+b of them.Comment 2. Another way to investigate the solutions of equation (1) is to consider the Laurent polynomialL(x)=sum_{i=1}^{n} x^{beta_{i}}-sum_{i=1}^{n-1} x^{gamma_{i}} .We can pick a sufficiently large integer d so that P(x)=x^{d} L(x) is a polynomial in mathbb{Z}[x].

Moreover, plugging x=-1 into (5) gives (p+q) mid P(-1), which, along with (4), implies p+q leqslant 2021 and q leqslant 1010. Hence x=(q+1) / q for some integer q with 1 leqslant q leqslant 1010."},{"problem":"In a geometric sequence of positive terms ({a_n}), if (a_2a_{18}=16), then (log_2a_{10}=)  (()    ())A: (2)B: (4)C: (8)D: (16)","solution":"Given that (a_2a_{18}=16), we can express this in terms of the first term (a_1) and the common ratio (r) as (a_1r cdot a_1r^{17} = 16), which simplifies to (a_1^2r^{18} = 16).

Thus, the total number of choices of pairs of vertical lines is frac{n cdot(n+1)}{2}. Similarly, the total number of choices of horizontal lines is frac{n(n+1)}{2}.

The other vertical line that contains the other vertices outside the new region can be chosen in n ways, corresponding exactly to the n first vertical lines on the left. Thus, we have n cdot n = n^2 choices for the vertical lines. To choose the horizontal lines, since we are assuming that there are exactly two vertices in the new region, they must be chosen from the n+1 first horizontal lines at the top. Since the order of choosing them does not matter, we have frac{n cdot (n+1)}{2} possible choices of vertical lines. The other possibility, where the two vertices are on a horizontal line, is analogous and it is only necessary to double the count we made previously to include them. Consequently, the total number of unwanted rectangles in this case is2 cdot n cdot n cdot frac{n cdot (n+1)}{2} = n^3(n+1)iii) Finally, to count the rectangles with only one vertex in the new region, note that it is the intersection of one of the n last vertical lines with one of the n first horizontal lines.

The number of square numbers up to (2020^2) is (2020) (since (2020^2) is the largest square number less than or equal to (2020^2)).   Therefore, after the first removal, the number of remaining bricks is:   [   2020^2 - 2020   ]2. General Case:   Let's denote the number of remaining bricks after the (k)-th removal as (t_k).

The total number of students is 800, and they need to be divided into 50 groups for the purpose of selecting students for a club competition.

First, we calculate the number of students per group:[ text{Number of students per group} = frac{text{Total number of students}}{text{Number of groups}} = frac{800}{50} = 16 ]This tells us that there are 16 students in each group, and also that the interval between the students selected from each group is 16.Given that the student with number 36 is selected in the 3rd group, we can determine the number of the student selected in the 16th group by recognizing this as an arithmetic sequence problem.

Given that ( n ) is the sum of the squares of its four smallest factors, we have:   [   n = d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2   ]   Substituting ( d_1 = 1 ), we get:   [   n = 1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2 = 1 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2   ]   Therefore:   [   n - 1 = d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2   ]3. If ( n ) were odd, then ( d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4 ) would all be odd, making ( n ) even, which is a contradiction. Hence, ( n ) must be even, implying ( d_2 = 2 ).4. Substituting ( d_2 = 2 ) into the equation, we get:   [   n - 5 = d_3^2 + d_4^2   ]5. Since ( n ) is even, ( d_3^2 + d_4^2 ) must be odd. This means one of ( d_3 ) and ( d_4 ) is odd while the other is even.Case 1: If ( d_4 ) is even, say ( d_4 = 2m ):- If ( m = 2 ), then ( d_3 ) must be 3, and:  [  n = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30  ]  However, ( d_4 = 4 ) does not divide 30, so ( n = 30 ) is not a solution.- If ( m > 2 ), since ( m ) must be a divisor (as ( 2m ) is a divisor), ( d_3 = m ) and:  [  n = 5 + 5m^2  ]  Since ( m mid n ):  [  m mid 5 + 5m^2 implies m mid 5 implies m = 5  ]  Therefore:  [  n = 5 + 5 cdot 5^2 = 5 + 125 = 130  ]  We need to check if 130 satisfies the problem's conditions. The divisors of 130 are 1, 2, 5, 10, 13, 26, 65, and 130. The smallest four divisors are 1, 2, 5, and 10. We check:  [  1^2 + 2^2 + 5^2 + 10^2 = 1 + 4 + 25 + 100 = 130  ]  Thus, ( n = 130 ) satisfies the conditions.Case 2: If ( d_3 ) is even, and there were some ( m geq 3 ) such that ( d_3 = 2m ):- Then ( m ) would be a divisor between ( d_2 ) and ( d_3 ), which is a contradiction. So ( m leq 2 ).- Since ( m = 1 ) yields ( d_3 = 2 ), which is absurd, ( m = 2 ) and ( d_3 = 4 ). Hence, if we say ( d_4 = k ):  [  n = 1^2 + 2^2 + 4^2 + k^2 = 1 + 4 + 16 + k^2 = 21 + k^2  ]  From ( k mid n ), we get ( k mid 21 ), so ( k = 7 ). However, this yields:  [  n = 21 + 7^2 = 21 + 49 = 70  ]  This does not satisfy the conditions since 4 does not divide 70.Thus, the only ( n ) that satisfies the problem's conditions is ( 130 ).The final answer is ( boxed{130} )."},{"problem":"At Olympic High School, frac{2}{5} of the freshmen and frac{4}{5} of the sophomores took the AMC-10.

Find the coefficients of x^{17} and x^{18} after expanding the brackets and combining like terms in the expressionleft(1+x^{5}+x^{7}right)^{20}","solution":"18. Let's repeat 20 times the trinomial 1+x^{3}+x^{7} and multiply it according to the usual rules. Each term of the resulting sum will represent a product of 20 factors, each equal to either 1, or x^{5}, or x^{7}. It is essential that in these products of twenty factors, any of the three expressions can stand in each of the 20 positions: the sum will contain terms that are products of all possible combinations of the specified factors (i.e., the product of 20 ones, the product of 19 ones and one factor x^{5}, the product of 19 ones and one factor x^{7}, the product of 18 ones, one factor x^{5}, and one factor x^{7}, and so on), taken in all possible orders (for example, we will have 20 different terms that are the product of 19 ones and x^{5}, because the factor x^{5} can stand in such a product in the first, second, third, ..., twentieth position, and all these will be different terms of our sum).All such products will represent x raised to some power, which is the sum of a certain number of fives and a certain number of sevens. But it is easy to check that the number 18 cannot be represented as the sum of addends taking the values 5 and 7; hence, the term x^{18} will not be present in our sum (the desired coefficient of x^{18} is zero).The number 17 can be uniquely represented as the sum of fives and sevens: 17=5+5+7. Therefore, x^{17} will be equal to those terms of our sum that are the product of two factors x^{5}, one factor x^{7}, and 17 factors 1. We need to determine the number of such products in our sum. The factor x^{7} can stand in any of the 20 positions. Let's assume for definiteness that it stands in the first position. After this, there are still 19 free positions, two of which must be occupied by factors x^{5}, and the remaining 17 by ones. If one of the factors x^{5} stands in a certain position, then the second can stand in any of the remaining 18 positions. Thus, we get 18 terms in which the first unoccupied position by x^{7} (i.e., the second) is occupied by x^{5}, 18 terms in which the second of these free positions is occupied by x^{5}, 18 terms in which the third such position is occupied by x^{5}, and so on, finally, 18 terms in which the last (nineteenth) free position is occupied by x^{5}. At first glance, it seems that there are 19.18 terms of the required form in which the factor x^{7} stands in the first position. However, in reality, there are half as many. Indeed, in each of these terms, the factors x^{5} stand in two positions (for example, in the i-th and k-th positions), so in our count, each of these terms is counted twice (in our example, the considered term is counted among the 18 products in which the i-th position is occupied by x^{5}, and among the 18 products in which the k-th position is occupied by x^{5}). Therefore, the actual number of terms of the required form in which the factor x^{7} stands in the first position is frac{19 cdot 18}{2}=171. There will be as many such terms in which x^{7} stands in the second, third, ..., twentieth position.

Divide the volunteers into groups: The volunteers need to be divided into 3 groups such that there is at least one volunteer in each group. The only way to do this, given 4 volunteers, is to have one group of 2 volunteers and two groups of 1 volunteer each. The number of ways to choose 2 volunteers out of 4 to form the larger group is calculated using combinations:[ {C}_{4}^{2} = frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6 ]2. Assign the remaining volunteers: After choosing the 2 volunteers for the larger group, we are left with 2 volunteers, which are automatically divided into the two groups of one each. The calculation for this is trivial since there's only one way to assign each to their own group, but for the sake of completeness:[ {C}_{2}^{1}{C}_{1}^{1} = 2 times 1 = 2 ]However, since the order of selection doesn't matter in the end (as we're just forming groups), we divide by the permutations of the 2 groups of one, which is {A}_{2}^{2} = 2! = 2, to correct for overcounting. This gives us:[ frac{6 times 2}{2} = 6 ]3. Assign groups to stadiums: Now, we have 3 groups to be assigned to 3 different stadiums. The number of ways to do this is given by the permutations of 3 items, which is:[ {A}_{3}^{3} = 3! = 6 ]Combining these steps, the total number of ways to allocate the volunteers is the product of the number of ways to form the groups and the number of ways to assign these groups to stadiums:[ 6 times 6 = 36 ]Therefore, the total number of ways to allocate the volunteers to the stadiums is boxed{36}."},{"problem":"Example 11.

The length of the altitude (h) is given by:   [   h = sqrt{ab}   ]2. Radius of the Circumscribed Circle: The hypotenuse of the right triangle is the diameter of the circumscribed circle.

Therefore, |A| geqslant|S|=10, meaning at least 10 locks are needed. Furthermore, it can be proven that 10 locks are sufficient. In this case, varphi is a one-to-one mapping from S to A. If {i, j} corresponds to a_{i j}, then all sons except the i-th and j-th sons are given the key to open a_{i j}. This way, for any i and j, there is exactly one lock a_{i j} that cannot be opened by the i-th and j-th sons, and if another son is added, they can open all the locks."},{"problem":"2.

Define the function ( f(n, k) ):   Let ( f(n, k) ) be the maximum number of binary sequences of length ( n ) such that fixing any arbitrary ( k ) bits does not produce all binary sequences of length ( k ).2. Base Case:   For ( k = 1 ), we can only have one sequence, otherwise, they will differ in at least one bit, which means that bit produces all binary sequences of length 1. Thus, ( f(n, 1) = 1 ).3. Inductive Hypothesis:   Assume that for some ( n ge k ), the function ( f(n, k) ) is given by:   [   f(n, k) = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} binom{n}{i}   ]4. Inductive Step:   Consider ( n+1 ) and show that:   [   f(n+1, k) = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} binom{n+1}{i}   ]5. Reduction to ( n-1 ) bits:   Let ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_m ) be ( m ) binary sequences of length ( n ). Consider the first ( n-1 ) bits of each sequence and name these new sequences ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_{t(m)} ). By the inductive hypothesis for ( n-1 ), we have:   [   t(m) le f(n-1, k)   ]6.

We need to show that:   [   r(m) le f(n-1, k-1)   ]7.

By the definition of ( C_i )'s, bits ( r_{i_1}, r_{i_2}, ldots, r_{i_{k-1}}, r_n ) produce all ( k )-bit sequences in ( A_i )'s, which is a contradiction.8. Combining Results:   By Pascal's identity, we have:   [   m = r(m) + t(m) le f(n-1, k) + f(n-1, k-1)   ]   Using the inductive hypothesis:   [   f(n-1, k) = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} binom{n-1}{i}   ]   [   f(n-1, k-1) = sum_{j=0}^{k-2} binom{n-1}{j}   ]   Therefore:   [   m le sum_{i=0}^{k-1} binom{n-1}{i} + sum_{j=0}^{k-2} binom{n-1}{j}   ]   By Pascal's identity:   [   sum_{i=0}^{k-1} binom{n-1}{i} + sum_{j=0}^{k-2} binom{n-1}{j} = binom{n}{0} + sum_{i=1}^{k-1} left( binom{n-1}{i} + binom{n-1}{i-1} right) = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} binom{n}{i}   ]9.

Since these 28 students represent 40 + 30 = 70% of the sample of 40 students, we can estimate the same percentage for the entire grade. Thus, 70% of 800 students is 0.7 times 800 = 560 students. Therefore, approximately boxed{560} students in the eighth grade have scores between 75 and 100.3. For Zhang Liang, who scored 78 points, the recommendation is to actively participate in physical fitness enhancement training programs. This is because the mean score of the sample is 80.5, and improving his score beyond this average would likely improve his fitness level. Therefore, aiming for a score higher than the mean, specifically more than 80.5 points, is a reasonable goal."},{"problem":"## Problem StatementCalculate the limit of the function:lim _{x rightarrow pi} frac{sin ^{2} x-tan ^{2} x}{(x-pi)^{4}}","solution":"## Solutionlim _{x rightarrow pi} frac{sin ^{2} x-tan ^{2} x}{(x-pi)^{4}}=lim _{x rightarrow pi} frac{frac{sin ^{2} x cdot cos ^{2} x}{cos ^{2} x}-tan ^{2} x}{(x-pi)^{4}}==lim _{x rightarrow pi} frac{tan ^{2} x cdot cos ^{2} x-tan ^{2} x}{(x-pi)^{4}}=lim _{x rightarrow pi} frac{tan ^{2} xleft(cos ^{2} x-1right)}{(x-pi)^{4}}==lim _{x rightarrow pi} frac{tan ^{2} xleft(-sin ^{2} xright)}{(x-pi)^{4}}=Substitution:x=y+pi Rightarrow y=x-pix rightarrow pi Rightarrow y rightarrow 0We get:=lim _{y rightarrow 0} frac{tan ^{2}(y+pi)left(-sin ^{2}(y+pi)right)}{((y+pi)-pi)^{4}}=lim _{y rightarrow 0} frac{tan ^{2} yleft(-(-sin y)^{2}right)}{y^{4}}==lim _{y rightarrow 0} frac{tan ^{2} yleft(-sin ^{2} yright)}{y^{4}}=Using the substitution of equivalent infinitesimals:sin y sim y, as y rightarrow 0tan y sim y, as y rightarrow 0We get:=lim _{y rightarrow 0} frac{y^{2}left(-y^{2}right)}{y^{4}}=lim _{y rightarrow 0} frac{-1}{1}=-1## Problem Kuznetsov Limits 13-7"},{"problem":"Determine the coordinates of the intersection point of the lines 3x+4y+7=0 and x-2y-1=0.","solution":"To find the intersection point, we need to solve the system of equations given by the two lines:begin{cases}3x + 4y + 7 = 0, x - 2y - 1 = 0.end{cases}We can solve this system using the substitution or elimination method.

By combining it with the ellipse equation frac{x^2}{m^2} + frac{y^2}{n^2} = 1, we getn^2 x^2 + m^2(kx + t)^2 = m^2 n^2.Simplify to get:(n^2 + m^2 k^2) x^2 + 2 m^2 kt x + m^2(t^2 - n^2) = 0 (1).From this, we obtain the discriminant Delta = 4m^4 k^2 t^2 - 4m^2(n^2 + m^2 k^2)(t^2 - n^2) = 0. This simplifies to t^2 = m^2 k^2 + n^2. Since equation (1) has only one root, denote it x_0.We have x_0 = -frac{m^2 kt}{n^2 + m^2 k^2} = -frac{m^2 k}{t}, which is the x-coordinate of the point of tangency.The y-coordinate of the point of tangency y_0 = kx_0 + t = frac{n^2}{t}. Thus frac{x_0}{y_0} = -frac{m^2 k}{n^2}, so k = -frac{n^2 x_0}{m^2 y_0}. The equation of the tangent line becomes y - y_0 = k(x - x_0) = -frac{n^2 x_0}{m^2 y_0}(x - x_0), which simplifies to frac{x_0 x}{m^2} + frac{y_0 y}{n^2} = 1. For the case where the tangent line slope does not exist, the tangent line is x = ±m, which also fits the formula frac{x_0 x}{m^2} + frac{y_0 y}{n^2} = 1.In summary, the equation of the tangent line at a point Q(x_0,y_0) on the ellipse C_1: frac{x^2}{m^2} + frac{y^2}{n^2} = 1 is frac{x_0 x}{m^2} + frac{y_0 y}{n^2} = 1.(III) Let a point P(x_P,y_P) be on the circle x^2 + y^2 = 16. PA and PB are tangents to the ellipse frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1. Let the points of tangency be A(x_1,y_1) and B(x_2,y_2). The tangents at points A and B can be written as frac{x_1 x}{4} + y_1 y = 1 and frac{x_2 x}{4} + y_2 y = 1, respectively. Both lines pass through the point P, thus we have frac{x_1 x_P}{4} + y_1 y_P = 1 and frac{x_2 x_P}{4} + y_2 y_P = 1. Hence, the line containing the chord AB has the equation frac{x x_P}{4} + y y_P = 1.The points M and N are determined as M(0, frac{1}{y_P}) and N(frac{4}{x_P}, 0). We find:begin{align*}|MN|^2 &= frac{16}{x_P^2} + frac{1}{y_P^2} &= left(frac{16}{x_P^2} + frac{1}{y_P^2}right) cdot frac{x_P^2 + y_P^2}{16} &= frac{1}{16}left(17 + frac{x_P^2}{y_P^2} + frac{16y_P^2}{x_P^2}right) &geq frac{1}{16}left(17 + 2sqrt{16}right) = frac{25}{16},end{align*}when and only when frac{x_P^2}{y_P^2} = frac{16y_P^2}{x_P^2} or equivalently x_P^2 = frac{64}{5} and y_P^2 = frac{16}{5}.

Thus 1004 = 2^2 cdot 251 | n(n+1) Longrightarrow 251 | n, n+1. We know that n cannot be 250 as 250 isn't divisible by 4, so 1004 doesn't divide n(n+1) = 250 cdot 251. Therefore, it is clear that n = boxed{251} is the smallest such integer.Solution 2We proceed with complex trigonometry. We know that for all theta, we have cos theta = dfrac{1}{2} left( z + dfrac{1}{z} right) and sin theta = dfrac{1}{2i} left( z - dfrac{1}{z} right) for some complex number z on the unit circle. Similarly, we have cos n theta = dfrac{1}{2} left( z^n + dfrac{1}{z^n} right) and sin n theta = dfrac{1}{2i} left(z^n - dfrac{1}{z^n} right). Thus, we have cos n^2 a sin n a = dfrac{1}{4i} left( z^{n^2} + dfrac{1}{z^{n^2}} right) left( z^{n} - dfrac{1}{z^n} right)= dfrac{1}{4i} left( z^{n^2 + n} - dfrac{1}{z^{n^2 + n}} - z^{n^2 - n} + dfrac{1}{z^{n^2 - n}} right)= dfrac{1}{2} left( dfrac{1}{2i} left(z^{n^2 + n} - dfrac{1}{z^{n^2 + n}} right) - dfrac{1}{2i} left(z^{n^2 - n} - dfrac{1}{z^{n^2 - n}} right) right)= dfrac{1}{2} left( sin ((n^2 + n)a) - sin ((n^2 - n)a) right)= dfrac{1}{2} left( sin(((n+1)^2 - (n+1))a) - sin((n^2 - n)a) right)which clearly telescopes! Since the 2 outside the brackets cancels with the dfrac{1}{2} inside, we see that the sum up to n terms is sin ((2^2 - 2)a) - sin ((1^2 - 1)a) + sin ((3^3 - 3)a) - sin ((2^2 - 2)a) cdots + sin (((n+1)^2 - (n+1))a) - sin ((n^2 - n)a)= sin (((n+1)^2 - (n+1))a) - sin(0)= sin ((n^2 + n)a) - 0= sin left( dfrac{n(n+1) pi}{2008} right).This expression takes on an integer value iff dfrac{2n(n+1)}{2008} = dfrac{n(n+1)}{1004} is an integer; that is, 1004 mid n(n+1). Clearly, 1004 = 2^2 cdot 251, implying that 251 mid n(n+1). Since we want the smallest possible value of n, we see that we must have {n,n+1} = 251. If n+1 = 251 rightarrow n=250, then we have n(n+1) = 250(251), which is clearly not divisible by 1004.

For this, consider an arbitrary placement of chips that satisfies the condition. Let ( S ) be the sum of the distances specified in the condition.Let the white and black chips in the ( i )-th column be in rows ( a_i ) and ( b_i ), respectively. We estimate the distance between them:[|a_i - b_i| = |(a_i - 4.5) - (b_i - 4.5)| leq |a_i - 4.5| + |b_i - 4.5|](essentially, this is the triangle inequality for points ( a_i, b_i ), and 4.5 on a line).

Given 0 leq{a}<1 and 0 leqleft{frac{1}{a}right}<1, the sum can be either 1 or 0. The latter is only possible if both a and frac{1}{a} are integers, i.e., a = pm 1. Thus, 1 = {x} + left{frac{1}{x}right} = x - [x] + frac{1}{x} - left[frac{1}{x}right], which implies that x + frac{1}{x} is an integer, but neither x nor frac{1}{x} is an integer.We will prove by induction on n that for any n, x^n + frac{1}{x^n} is an integer.

The question arises as to which x satisfy the given relationship in the problem. From the condition x + frac{1}{x} in mathbb{Z}, it follows that x + frac{1}{x} = k (where k in mathbb{Z}). This leads to the quadratic equation x^2 - kx + 1 = 0. The solutions to this equation are numbers of the form frac{k pm sqrt{k^2 - 4}}{2}, and the reciprocal of frac{k + sqrt{k^2 - 4}}{2} is precisely frac{k - sqrt{k^2 - 4}}{2}. The obtained root provides a solution for every integer |k| geq 2, but for |k| = 2, the root itself is an integer. This x is not suitable, so |k| geq 3 is necessary; moreover, it can be easily shown that x cannot be an integer for other values of k.2. Knowing the possible values of x, it is easy to see that for even k, x^{2001} + frac{1}{x^{2001}} is an integer, but for odd k, this is not so obvious. In this case, the same can be calculated using the induction seen in the solution (or by checking the coefficients of the 2002 terms in the sum).

Each point has 3k+6 edges. For any two points the number of points joined to both is the same. Find k. Solution","solution":": k = 3. Let n be the number of points joined to two given points. [We are given that n is independent of the points chosen.] Take any point A of the graph. We count the number N of pairs (B, C), where the point B is joined to A, the point C is not joined to A, and the points B and C are joined. For any point C not joined to A, there are just n points joined to C and A. There are 3k+6 points joined to A and hence (12k - 1 - (3k+6) ) = 9k-7 points not joined to A. So N = (9k-7)n. Now given a point B joined to A, it is joined to 3k+5 other points, n of which are also joined to A, so it is joined to (3k+5-n) points which are not joined to A. So N = (3k+6)(3k+5-n). Thus we have: 9k 2 + 33k - 12kn + 30 + n = 0. Hence n = 3m for some integer m and m = (3k 2 + 11k + 10)/(12k - 1), so 4m = k + 3 + (9k+43)/(12k-1). If k ≥ 15, then 0 < (9k+43)/(12k-1) < 1, which would make m non-integral. It is now easy to check that (9k+43)/(12k-1) = 52/11, 61/23, 2, 79/47, 88/59, 97/71, 106/83, 23/19, 124/107, 19/17, 142/131, 151/143, 32/31, 169/167 for k = 1, 2, ... , 14. So the only solution in k = 3. We now have to demonstrate explicitly that there is such a graph for k = 3. Consider: 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 1 2 3 4 5 5 6 1 2 3 4 4 5 6 1 2 3 3 4 5 6 1 2 2 3 4 5 6 1 Each digit represents a point of the graph. Join each point to those in the same row or column and to those with the same digit. Each point is joined to 5 points in the same row, 5 in the same column and to 5 others, a total of 15 = 3k+6. It remains to show that given any two points P and Q, there are just 6 points joined to both. If P and Q are in the same row, then they are both joined to: the 4 other points in the row, the point in the same column as P with the same digit as Q, and the point in the same column as Q with the same digit as P - a total of 6. Similarly, if P and Q are in the same column. If P and Q have the same digit, then they are both joined to: the 4 other points with the same digit, the point in the same row as P and the same column as Q, and the point in the same column as P and the same row as Q. Finally, suppose P and Q are in different rows and columns and have different digits. Then the points joined to both are: (1) same row as P and same column as Q, (2) same row as P and same digit as Q, (3) same column as P and same row as Q, (4) same column as P and same digit as Q, (5) same digit as P and same row as Q, (6) same digit as P and same column as Q. 36th IMO shortlist 1995 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 8 Oct 2002"},{"problem":"## Problem StatementCalculate the limit of the numerical sequence:lim _{n rightarrow infty} frac{n^{2}+sqrt{n}-1}{2+7+12+ldots+(5 n-3)}","solution":"## Solutionlim _{n rightarrow infty} frac{n^{2}+sqrt{n}-1}{2+7+12+ldots+(5 n-3)}=lim _{n rightarrow infty} frac{n^{2}+sqrt{n}-1}{left(frac{(2+(5 n-3)) n}{2}right)}=begin{aligned}& =lim _{n rightarrow infty} frac{2left(n^{2}+sqrt{n}-1right)}{(5 n-1) n}=lim _{n rightarrow infty} frac{frac{1}{n^{2}} 2left(n^{2}+sqrt{n}-1right)}{frac{1}{n^{2}}(5 n-1) n}= & =lim _{n rightarrow infty} frac{2left(1+sqrt{frac{1}{n^{3}}}-frac{1}{n^{2}}right)}{5-frac{1}{n}}=frac{2(1+0-0)}{5-0}=frac{2}{5}end{aligned}## Problem Kuznetsov Limits 6-22"},{"problem":"Given that acute angles alpha and beta satisfy frac{sin2alpha}{cos2alpha-1}=frac{1-tanbeta}{1+tanbeta}, then cos (alpha +beta)=____.","solution":"Given that acute angles alpha and beta satisfy the equation frac{sin 2alpha}{cos 2alpha - 1} = frac{1 - tan beta}{1 + tan beta}, we aim to find the value of cos (alpha + beta). Let's break down the solution into detailed steps:1. Starting with the given equation:   [   frac{sin 2alpha}{cos 2alpha - 1} = frac{1 - tan beta}{1 + tan beta}   ]2. Simplifying both sides:   - The left side can be rewritten using the double angle identities sin 2alpha = 2sin alpha cos alpha and cos 2alpha = 1 - 2sin^2 alpha. Thus, we have:     [     frac{2sin alpha cos alpha}{-2sin^2 alpha}     ]   - The right side can be simplified by recognizing that tan beta = frac{sin beta}{cos beta}, leading to:     [     frac{cos beta - sin beta}{cos beta + sin beta}     ]3. Equating the simplified forms:   [   frac{cos alpha}{-sin alpha} = frac{cos beta - sin beta}{cos beta + sin beta}   ]4. Rearranging terms to match the cosine of a sum formula:   - By cross-multiplying and rearranging, we find:     [     cos alpha cos beta - sin alpha sin beta = -(sin alpha cos beta + cos alpha sin beta)     ]   - This equation can be interpreted as:     [     cos (alpha + beta) = -sin (alpha + beta)     ]5. Considering the acute nature of alpha and beta:   - Since alpha and beta are acute, cos (alpha + beta)  0.6. Using the Pythagorean identity to solve for cos (alpha + beta):   - We know that cos^2 (alpha + beta) + sin^2 (alpha + beta) = 1.   - Given cos (alpha + beta) = -sin (alpha + beta), we substitute to get 2cos^2 (alpha + beta) = 1.   - Solving for cos (alpha + beta), we find:     [     cos (alpha + beta) = -frac{sqrt{2}}{2}     ]Therefore, the final answer is boxed{-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}}."},{"problem":"Given a linear function y = kx + b whose graph passes through points M(0, 2) and N(1, 3),(1) Find the analytical expression of the linear function.(2) Find the coordinates of the intersection point between the linear function and the x-axis.","solution":"(1) According to the given conditions, the graph passes through point M(0, 2) which implies that when x = 0, the value of y is 2.

Identify the recurrence relation:   The recurrence relation is:   [   x_{n+1} = 4x_n - x_{n-1}.   ]3. Find the characteristic equation:   To solve the recurrence relation, we find the characteristic equation associated with it:   [   t^2 - 4t + 1 = 0.   ]   Solving this quadratic equation, we get:   [   t = frac{4 pm sqrt{16 - 4}}{2} = frac{4 pm sqrt{12}}{2} = frac{4 pm 2sqrt{3}}{2} = 2 pm sqrt{3}.   ]4.

This calculation comes from the fact that each of the 81 squares has 4 borders, but each border is shared by two squares, so we divide by 2.   - If two adjacent squares are the same color, there is no value added to either square.   - If two adjacent squares are of different colors, this border contributes a +1 to one of the squares and +2 to the other, so +3 to the total sum of all values.4. Optimal Coloring Strategy:   - To maximize the sum, we need to maximize the number of borders between squares of different colors.   - A checkerboard-style coloring ensures that no two adjacent cells are the same color. This means every border between two squares will contribute +3 to the total sum.5.

Thus, the edge length of the cube is dfrac{sqrt{2}}{2}a.  Hence, the circumscribed sphere of this tetrahedron is the same as that of the cube,  since the diameter of the circumscribed sphere is the diagonal length of the cube,  therefore, the radius of the circumscribed sphere is R= dfrac{1}{2} sqrt{dfrac{1}{2}+ dfrac{1}{2}+ dfrac{1}{2}}a= dfrac{sqrt{6}}{4}a,  thus, the surface area of the circumscribed sphere is: 4pi R^{2}=4pi times (dfrac{sqrt{6}}{4} times sqrt{2})^{2}=3pi.  Hence, the answer is boxed{3pi}.  Since all edges of the regular tetrahedron S-ABC are of length a, this tetrahedron can definitely be placed inside a cube with edge length dfrac{sqrt{2}}{2}a, so the circumscribed sphere of this tetrahedron is the same as that of the cube.

Since g(x) is an increasing function on mathbb{R}, we must have g'(x) = -2x + 2 - ae^x geq 0 for all x in mathbb{R}. This implies that[a leq frac{-2x + 2}{e^x}]must hold true for all x. Let h(x) = frac{-2x + 2}{e^x}, and finding its derivative gives h'(x) = frac{2(x - 2)}{e^x}. Setting h'(x) = 0, we find x = 2. Analyzing the behaviour of h'(x) shows that h(x) is decreasing for x in (-infty, 2) and increasing for x in (2, +infty). The minimum value of h(x) occurs at x = 2, yielding h_{text{min}}(2) = frac{-2}{e^2}.

Since for t > 0, varphi'(t) = e^t - 1 > 0, varphi(t) is increasing. Thus, varphi(t) > varphi(0) = 0, and consequently h'(t) > 0. Since h'(t) > 0, the function h(t) is increasing, and h(t) > h(0) = 0 holds for t > 0, which confirms that 2te^t < e^{2t} - 1. This provides the proof that[e^{frac{x_1 - x_2}{2}} < frac{e^{x_1 - x_2} - 1}{x_1 - x_2},]which is equivalent to the original inequality fleft(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}right) < frac{f(x_1) - f(x_2)}{x_1 - x_2}.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to place positive integers on an infinite chessboard such that:   - No two numbers are equal.   - For any number ( m ) placed on a square ( C ), at least ( k ) of the squares orthogonally adjacent to ( C ) have a multiple of ( m ) written on them.2. Analyzing the Constraints:   - If ( k = 4 ), then all four orthogonally adjacent squares must have multiples of ( m ). This is impossible because two adjacent squares cannot both divide each other. Hence, ( k neq 4 ).   - If ( k = 3 ), consider a square with a number ( a ). Suppose the number ( ka ) is written next to it. Without loss of generality, let the number not divisible by ( a ) be to its left. Below ( ka ), there must be a multiple of it, say ( akb ). The square to the left of this must be a multiple of both ( a ) and ( akb ), which is not possible since it cannot divide both.3. Constructing a Solution for ( k = 2 ):   - We need to show that it is possible to place numbers such that each number ( m ) has at least 2 orthogonally adjacent squares with multiples of ( m ).   - Start by placing the numbers ( 1, 2, 4, 8 ) in a ( 2 times 2 ) square:     [     begin{array}{|c|c|}     hline     1 & 2      hline     4 & 8      hline     end{array}     ]   - We can extend this pattern by adding new rows or columns while maintaining the condition. For example, add a new column to the right:     [     begin{array}{|c|c|c|}     hline     1 & 2 & 16      hline     4 & 8 & 32      hline     end{array}     ]     Here, ( 16 ) is a multiple of ( 2 ) and ( 8 ), and ( 32 ) is a multiple of ( 4 ) and ( 8 ).4. Generalizing the Construction:   - For any new row or column, pick the top right square and add a multiple of it to its right. Below it, take a multiple of the product of numbers on the left and top (choose multiples large enough to ensure distinctness).   - This ensures that each number has at least 2 orthogonally adjacent squares with multiples of it.The final answer is ( boxed{ k = 2 } )."},{"problem":"Let n and k be positive integers such that k geq n and k-n is an even number.

N / M=2^{k-n}.Let's establish a correspondence such that every sequence in M corresponds to 2^{k-n} sequences in N in such a way that every sequence in N is obtained exactly once.Take a sequence m from M. (In this sequence, every lamp from 1 to n is toggled an odd number of times.) Start following the steps of the sequence. When we would toggle a lamp (let it be the i-th lamp) that is also toggled later in m, we can proceed in two ways: toggle the i-th lamp or the (n+i)-th lamp, then continue to the next step. If the step is not of this type, i.e., we do not toggle this lamp again in m, we check how many times we have toggled the i-th lamp so far. If it has been toggled an even number of times, we toggle the i-th lamp now; if it has been toggled an odd number of times, we toggle the (n+i)-th lamp (here we have no choice). With this method, by the end, the i-th lamp will definitely be on, and the (n+i)-th lamp will definitely be off, since the i-th lamp appeared an odd number of times in the original sequence and also in this one, so we have toggled the (n+i)-th lamp an even number of times. At the same time, we have performed k steps, just like in the original sequence, so the resulting sequence is an element of N.During the creation of the sequence, we toggled the first n lamps at least once, so there were n steps where we toggled one of them for the last time, and the remaining (k-n) steps were of the type where we had a choice. Thus, we have assigned 2^{k-n} elements of N to each element of M. We only need to show that every element of N is obtained exactly once. This is true because if we take a sequence from N and replace every toggle of the (n+i)-th lamp with a toggle of the i-th lamp, we get the one and only sequence in M from which this N-sequence can be obtained.

How many different arrangements are possible? (We do not consider two arrangements different if one can be transformed into the other by a symmetry of the cube - rotation, reflection in a plane or about the center, nor do we consider different two arrangements if one is obtained from the other by replacing each number with the number that is one greater, and 6 with 1.)","solution":"I. solution. Hold the cube so that one of its faces is vertically in front of us and label its top, front, bottom, left, back, and right faces as F, E, A, B, H, J respectively.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_da74a361244ecb581df3g-1.jpg?height=356&width=642&top_left_y=262&top_left_x=735)According to the rules, consecutive numbers must be written on adjacent faces; the third number can be placed on a face parallel to the one containing the first number, or on a face adjacent to the previous two numbers. We will look for arrangements where three consecutive numbers are placed in the first mentioned manner and separately for those where this does not occur. (We also consider 1 as the number following 6.)If there are three consecutive numbers on faces connected by parallel edges, then by adjusting the numbers by the same amount if necessary, we can achieve that these are 1, 2, 3, and by rotating the cube, we can place them on F, E, and A respectively - in the following, we will denote this as 1 rightarrow F, 2 rightarrow E, 3 rightarrow A.The number 4 cannot be written on H, because then the 5 and 6 would have to be placed on the non-adjacent B, J faces. The further options 4 rightarrow B and 4 rightarrow J are mirror images of each other with respect to the plane of symmetry parallel to B, J, so it is enough to examine, for example, the 4 rightarrow B option. In this case, the only remaining empty neighbor of B is H, so 5 rightarrow H, and the 6 can be written on the still empty J, because J is adjacent to the F containing the 1. Thus, we essentially have only one cube of the first type. Here, the numbers 1-6 are written on the faces F, E, A, B, H, J respectively.If it is not possible to place three consecutive numbers on faces connected by parallel edges, then by writing 1 and 2 on F and E respectively, 3 can be placed on B or J. The two possibilities are again mirror images of each other with respect to the plane of symmetry parallel to B and J, so it is enough to examine, for example, 3 rightarrow B. In this case, 4 rightarrow H is not allowed, so 4 must go to A; 5 rightarrow J is again not allowed, so 5 must go to H and 6 to J. This is a valid arrangement because the F containing the 1 is adjacent to both J and the H containing the 5, and J is adjacent to the E containing the 2. Thus, there is essentially only one arrangement of the second type, where the numbers 1-6 are placed on the faces F, E, B, A, H, J respectively.This way, we have found 2 solutions to the problem, and due to the distinguishing property used, they cannot be transformed into each other by any allowed transformation.II. solution. By traversing the faces of the cube in the order of the numbers written on them and repeating the traversal once from any face, we can reach the opposite face in 2, 3, or 4 steps - because after 1 step we are still on an adjacent face and after 5 steps we are back on the same face. From the opposite face, we can return to the starting face in 4, 3, or 2 steps, respectively, because from any face we return to the same face after 6 steps. Thus, the shorter distance between two parallel faces along the traversal can only be 2 or 3 steps.Characterize the valid arrangements of the problem as traversals by specifying the traversal distance between the 3 pairs of parallel faces of the cube. Then the following four distance triples can be considered:2,2,2 ; quad 2,2,3 ; quad 2,3,3 ; quad 3,3,3(The order within each number triple is irrelevant.)Let the 3 distances be denoted by t_{1}, t_{2}, t_{3}, and let the numbers on the faces at distance t_{1} be a, b, on the faces at distance t_{2} be c, d, and on the faces at distance t_{3} be e, f. Then the differences b-a, d-c, f-e match t_{1}, t_{2}, t_{3}, or differ from them by some multiple of 6. On the other hand, each of the numbers 1 to 6 appears exactly once among a, b, c, d, e, f. Thus, on the one hand,b-a+d-c+f-e=t_{1}+t_{2}+t_{3}+6 cdot kwhere k is some integer, and on the other hand,begin{aligned}& b-a+d-c+f-e=a+b+c+d+e+f-2(a+c+e)= & quad=1+2+3+4+5+6-2(a+c+e)=21-2(a+c+e)end{aligned}so the sum of the three differences is odd, and thus the sum of the three distances must also be odd. Therefore, the first and third options cannot occur.There is a traversal of the second type where the pair of faces at a distance of 3 units has 1 and 4 written on them - the possible pairings and differences of the remaining numbers are:the differences for the pairs 2,5 and 3,6 are: 3 and 3,the differences for the pairs 2,6 and 3,5 are: 4 and 2,the third pairing is valid. From this, we get 1 traversal, because after fixing 1 rightarrow F, 4 rightarrow A, the 2 can be brought to E by rotating the cube around its vertical axis if necessary, so 6 rightarrow H, and the two possible placements of the 3,5 pair on the B, J faces are mirror images of each other with respect to the plane of symmetry of the B, J face pair.There is also a traversal of the fourth type - essentially 1 - because the differences for the pairs 1,4; 2,5 and 3,6 are 3,3 and 3.It is clear from the construction that neither of these two solutions can be transformed into each other by symmetry or by shifting the numbers along the traversal path."},{"problem":"Determine the coefficient of x^{3} in the expansion of (2x+sqrt{x})^{5}.","solution":"The general term of the expansion of (2x+sqrt{x})^{5} is given byT_{k+1}=C_{5}^{k}(2x)^{5-k}cdot (sqrt{x})^k=C_{5}^{k}2^{5-k}x^{5-frac{k}{2}},where kin{0,1,2,3,4,5}.

So x=13 a, where a is a positive integer. It then follows from (*) that8(13 a)=13(10-y)and so, cancelling the factor 138 a=10-y,and hence 10-y is a positive number which is a multiple of 8 .

Substituting y=1 and y=z into the given functional equation we obtain f(z)=z and fleft(z^{2}right)+alpha=z+f(z), whereby the first two parts of the claim are proved. Applying the first part to z in place of x we infer that z^{2} f(z)=z^{3} is a fixed point of f as well, i.e., fleft(z^{3}right)=z^{3}.

Comparing the two previous results we learn indeed z^{3}=3 z-2 alpha.In the particular case x=1 we have z=alpha and the third part of the lemma tells us alpha^{3}=alpha.

Determine the coordinates of the vertices:   - We start by placing the original pentagon in a coordinate system. Let one vertex be at the origin ((0, 0, 0)).   - The coordinates of the adjacent vertices can be determined using the angles of a regular pentagon.

If the annual average profit reaches the maximum after the equipment has been used for n years (nin N^{*}), then the value of n is ( ).A: 6B: 5C: 4D: 3","solution":"To solve the problem, we first need to understand how the annual profit is calculated and how it changes over time. Let's break down the solution into detailed steps:1. Setting up the Operating Cost Sequence:   - Given that the operating cost in the first year is 20,000 (or 2 in thousands of dollars) and it increases by 20,000 (2 in thousands of dollars) each year, we can conclude that the operating cost forms an arithmetic sequence.   - The first term of this arithmetic sequence (a_1) is 2, and the common difference (d) is also 2.   - Therefore, the operating cost in the nth year (a_n) can be expressed as:          a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d = 2 + (n-1) times 2 = 2n     2. Calculating the Total Operating Cost Over n Years:   - The total operating cost for n years is the sum of the first n terms of the arithmetic sequence, which can be calculated using the formula T_n = dfrac{n}{2} [2a_1 + (n-1)d].   - Substituting a_1 = 2 and d = 2, we get:          T_n = dfrac{n}{2} [2 times 2 + (n-1) times 2] = dfrac{n}{2} [4 + 2n - 2] = dfrac{n}{2} [2n + 2] = n(n + 1)        - Thus, the total operating cost for n years is T_n = n^2 + n (in thousands of dollars).3. Determining the Total Profit After n Years:   - The annual revenue generated by the equipment is 110,000 (or 11 in thousands of dollars).   - The initial cost of the equipment is 90,000 (or 9 in thousands of dollars), which is a one-time cost.   - Therefore, the total profit after n years (S_n) can be calculated as the total revenue minus the total operating costs and the initial cost:          S_n = 11n - (n^2 + n) - 9 = -n^2 + 10n - 9     4. Calculating the Annual Average Profit:   - The annual average profit is the total profit over n years divided by the number of years, n.   - Substituting the expression for S_n, we get:          text{Annual Average Profit} = dfrac{-n^2 + 10n - 9}{n} = 10 - left(n + dfrac{9}{n}right)     5. Maximizing the Annual Average Profit:   - To maximize the annual average profit, we need to find the value of n that maximizes the expression 10 - left(n + dfrac{9}{n}right).   - By analyzing this expression, we can see that when n=3, the decrease from 10 due to the terms n + dfrac{9}{n} is minimized, resulting in the maximum average profit.   - Therefore, the maximum annual average profit is achieved after the equipment has been used for 3 years.Thus, the correct answer is boxed{D}."},{"problem":"Among the functions y=cos x, y=x^3, y=e^x, y=ln x, the odd functions are (　　)  A: y=cos x  B: y=x^3  C: y=e^x  D: y=ln x","solution":"1.

The perpendicular from D to the plane S of the face ABC intersects the plane at D' (1st figure). Since the two faces form an obtuse angle, D' lies on the other side of the line AB in the plane S compared to C. Therefore, the altitude DD' - except for the point D - lies outside the tetrahedron. A similar statement can be made about the altitude from vertex C. If the faces meeting at the edge DC also form an obtuse angle, then the altitudes from vertices A and B also lie outside the tetrahedron. Such a tetrahedron exists. In the 2nd figure, let the opposite edges AB and CD of the tetrahedron ABCD be 6 units long, and both are parallel to the plane of the drawing, with a distance of 1 unit between them, and their projections form a square. The dihedral angle alpha at the edges AB and CD is such that operatorname{tg} frac{alpha}{2} = frac{3}{1}, so the dihedral angles are obtuse.If one of the dihedral angles at the opposite edges AB and CD is an obtuse angle and the other is an acute angle, then exactly two altitudes lie outside the tetrahedron. We get such a tetrahedron if, in the previous construction, we take AB to be less than 2 units, keeping all other data unchanged.We will show that exactly three altitudes can also lie outside the tetrahedron. In the 3rd figure, ABC is an equilateral triangle, and the projection of vertex D is the center of the triangle, with F being the midpoint of edge BC. The altitude from D has a segment inside the tetrahedron. If the angle ADF is an obtuse angle, the other three altitudes lie outside the tetrahedron.In a regular tetrahedron, no altitude lies outside the tetrahedron.It remains to examine the case where exactly one altitude can lie outside the tetrahedron. We give a negative answer to this. Based on the 1st figure, if D' is a point outside the triangle ABC, then at least one dihedral angle is an obtuse angle, and there will be at least one more altitude that lies outside the tetrahedron.Summarizing, we can conclude that 0, 2, 3, or 4 altitudes of the tetrahedron can lie outside the tetrahedron.Based on the work of Máthé András (Bp., Apáczai Csere J.

Interpret the problem in terms of graph theory:   - We are given 2014 points in the plane, no three of which are collinear.   - We need to find the minimum number of line segments (edges) such that adding any additional line segment will always form a triangle (a K_3 subgraph).2. Graph Theory Translation:   - Consider the points as vertices of a graph.   - We need to ensure that every pair of vertices has a common neighbor, which implies that adding any new edge will create a triangle.3. Constructing the Graph:   - To achieve the condition where adding any new edge forms a triangle, we can use a star graph configuration.   - In a star graph, one central vertex is connected to all other vertices. This ensures that every pair of vertices has a common neighbor (the central vertex).4. Counting the Edges:   - In a star graph with 2014 vertices, the central vertex is connected to the remaining 2013 vertices.   - Therefore, the number of edges in this configuration is 2013.5. Verification:   - If there are fewer than 2013 edges, the graph is not connected, meaning there exist at least two vertices with no path between them.   - Adding an edge between any two such vertices would not necessarily form a triangle, contradicting the problem's requirement.6.

Thus, the coordinates of the foci are F_1(-1,0) and F_2(1,0).The distance d from a point (x_1,y_1) to a line Ax+By+C=0 is given by the formula d=frac{|Ax_1+By_1+C|}{sqrt{A^2+B^2}}.For line l (y=x-2 or x-y-2=0), the distance from point F_1 is:d_1=frac{|-1-0-2|}{sqrt{1^2+(-1)^2}}=frac{3sqrt{2}}{2}Similarly, the distance from point F_2 is:d_2=frac{|1-0-2|}{sqrt{1^2+(-1)^2}}=frac{sqrt{2}}{2}Therefore, the sum of these distances is:d_1+d_2=frac{3sqrt{2}}{2}+frac{sqrt{2}}{2}=boxed{2sqrt{2}}"},{"problem":"Given circles (C_{1}: x^{2}+y^{2}-2x+4y-4=0), (C_{2}: x^{2}+y^{2}+2x+2y-2=0), and (C_{3}: x^{2}+y^{2}-2x-2y- frac {14}{5}=0), find the length of the chord cut by circle (C_{3}) on the common chord of circles (C_{1}) and (C_{2}).","solution":"Since (C_{1}: x^{2}+y^{2}-2x+4y-4=0) and (C_{2}: x^{2}+y^{2}+2x+2y-2=0),  subtracting the two equations gives the equation of the common chord as (4x-2y+2=0), which simplifies to (2x-y+1=0).  From (C_{3}: x^{2}+y^{2}-2x-2y- frac {14}{5}=0), we get the standard equation of the circle as ((x-1)^{2}+(y-1)^{2}= frac {24}{5}).  Thus, the center of (C_{3}) is at ((1,1)) with a radius (R= sqrt { frac {24}{5}}= frac {2 sqrt {30}}{5}).  Therefore, the distance (d) from the center of (C_{3}) to (2x-y+1=0) is (d= frac {|2-1+1|}{ sqrt {2^{2}+1}}= frac {2}{ sqrt {5}}= frac {2 sqrt {5}}{5}).

Graph Representation:   Represent the points ( V_1, V_2, ldots, V_n ) as vertices of a graph, and the segments ( V_iV_j ) as edges. The problem then translates to finding the minimum number of edges such that the graph is harmonic.3. Cycle and Permutations:   If we have ( n ) segments, we can form a single cycle. However, a single cycle can only generate ( n ) different permutations, but we need to be able to reach all ( n! ) permutations.4. Adding an Extra Edge:   Suppose we have ( n+1 ) segments. Construct the segments so that ( V_i ) is connected to ( V_{i+1} ) (including ( V_n ) to ( V_1 )), forming an ( n )-cycle. Additionally, connect ( V_1 ) to ( V_4 ), forming a 4-cycle within the ( n )-cycle.5. Permutations Using Cycles:   - By using the ( n )-cycle, we can shift all pieces cyclically.   - By using the 4-cycle, we can permute any 4 consecutive pieces.   - For example, if we have 5 adjacent pieces ( a, b, c, d, e ), we can perform the following permutations:     [     (a, b, c, d, e) rightarrow (c, d, a, b, e) rightarrow (c, a, b, e, d) rightarrow (a, b, e, c, d)     ]     This shows that we can generate any 3-cycle within the 5 pieces.6. Achieving the Desired Permutation:   - Using the 3-cycle and 4-cycle, we can move ( C_1 ) to ( V_1 ), then ( C_2 ) to ( V_2 ), and so on, without disturbing the already placed pieces.   - For the last few pieces, if we end up with ( C_{n-3}, C_{n-2}, C_n, C_{n-1} ) in ( V_{n-3}, V_{n-2}, V_{n-1}, V_n ) respectively, we can use the 4-cycle to rearrange them as needed.7. Final Adjustment:   - Use the 4-cycle to get ( C_{n-1}, C_{n-3}, C_{n-2}, C_n ).   - Then use the 3-cycle to get ( C_{n-3}, C_{n-2}, C_{n-1}, C_n ).Thus, the minimum number of segments in a harmonic set is ( n+1 ).The final answer is (boxed{n+1})."},{"problem":"Which of the following statements about a prism are correct?

The lateral edges are equal, and the lateral faces are parallelograms: This is the definition of a right prism. For an oblique prism, the lateral edges are equal if they are measured perpendicularly to the base faces. The lateral faces of any prism are parallelograms because opposite sides are created from intersections with the planes of the parallel bases. Thus, Statement 1 is true.2. The two base faces and the cross-section parallel to the base face are congruent polygons: By the definition of a prism, the base faces are always congruent. Furthermore, any cross-section parallel to these base faces will be between two planes parallel to the bases. This means they will be bounded by lines parallel to those bounding the bases and thus must also be congruent to the base faces. Thus, Statement 2 is true.3. The cross-section through two non-adjacent lateral edges is a parallelogram: For any prism, if you take a cross-section through two non-adjacent lateral edges, you are cutting parallel to the base faces by a plane. The result would be a parallelogram because opposite sides of this cross-section (which are segments of the lateral edges) are parallel (by definition of a prism, since the bases are parallel). Thus, Statement 3 is true.Therefore, the answer is:[boxed{D}] (1, 2, and 3)"},{"problem":"3.

First method. Cut the frame into four identical rectangles as shown in the figure. The width of the rectangles is equal to the width of the frame, i.e., 2 cells. The length of each rectangle is 2 less than the side of the frame: 254-2=252 cells. Then the area of one rectangle is 2 cdot 252=504. Therefore, the total number of cells in the frame is 4 cdot 504=2016.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_af60849ded79da38d4cfg-1.jpg?height=283&width=280&top_left_y=1355&top_left_x=888)Second method. The area of the frame can be obtained by subtracting the area of the inner square from the area of the large square 254 times 254. The side of the inner square is 4 cells shorter than the side of the large square. Therefore, the area of the frame is254^{2}-250^{2}=(254-250)(254+250)=4 cdot 504=2016.Remark.

In this case, the number of ways to jump 3 times (which definitely does not reach point D) is 2^{3}-2 (each jump has 2 ways, and jumping 3 times has a total of 2^{3} ways, of which 2 ways reach point D and should be excluded), and the number of ways for the last 2 jumps is 2^{2}.

First, we will prove that ( p < n sqrt{6} ), and then we will prove that ( p < (n + 2) sqrt{frac{n}{3}} ).1. Proving ( p < n sqrt{6} ):   Let ( p = |S| ). Since all pairwise distances between points in ( S ) are distinct, there are at most ( binom{p}{2} = frac{p(p-1)}{2} ) distinct distances.    The maximum possible distance between any two points with integer coordinates ( (x_1, y_1, z_1) ) and ( (x_2, y_2, z_2) ) in the range ( 1 leq x, y, z leq n ) is given by:   [   sqrt{(n-1)^2 + (n-1)^2 + (n-1)^2} = sqrt{3(n-1)^2} = (n-1)sqrt{3}   ]   Therefore, the number of distinct distances is at most ( (n-1)sqrt{3} ).   We have:   [   frac{p(p-1)}{2} < (n-1)sqrt{3}   ]   Multiplying both sides by 2:   [   p(p-1) < 2(n-1)sqrt{3}   ]   To prove ( p < n sqrt{6} ), assume for contradiction that ( p geq n sqrt{6} ). Then:   [   p(p-1) geq n sqrt{6} (n sqrt{6} - 1)   ]   Simplifying the right-hand side:   [   n sqrt{6} (n sqrt{6} - 1) = 6n^2 - n sqrt{6}   ]   Therefore:   [   p(p-1) geq 6n^2 - n sqrt{6}   ]   Since ( 6n^2 - n sqrt{6} > 2(n-1)sqrt{3} ) for ( n > 1 ), this leads to a contradiction. Hence, ( p < n sqrt{6} ).2. Proving ( p < (n + 2) sqrt{frac{n}{3}} ):   We need to show that:   [   p(p-1) < (n+2)^2 frac{n}{3}   ]   Assume for contradiction that ( p geq (n+2) sqrt{frac{n}{3}} ). Then:   [   p(p-1) geq (n+2) sqrt{frac{n}{3}} left( (n+2) sqrt{frac{n}{3}} - 1 right)   ]   Simplifying the right-hand side:   [   (n+2) sqrt{frac{n}{3}} left( (n+2) sqrt{frac{n}{3}} - 1 right) = (n+2)^2 frac{n}{3} - (n+2) sqrt{frac{n}{3}}   ]   Therefore:   [   p(p-1) geq (n+2)^2 frac{n}{3} - (n+2) sqrt{frac{n}{3}}   ]   Since ( (n+2)^2 frac{n}{3} - (n+2) sqrt{frac{n}{3}} > 2(n-1)sqrt{3} ) for ( n > 1 ), this leads to a contradiction.

Finding the maximum value of f(x):Given f(x) = ln x - x + 1, we first find its derivative to determine the function's behavior:f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(ln x - x + 1) = frac{1}{x} - 1 = frac{1-x}{x}.- For 0  0 because the numerator (1-x) is positive and the denominator x is also positive. This implies f(x) is increasing in this interval.- For x > 1, f'(x) < 0 since (1-x) is negative, indicating f(x) is decreasing in this interval.At x=1, f'(x) = 0, which is a critical point. Since f(x) increases before x=1 and decreases after, x=1 is the point of maximum value of f(x). Therefore, we calculate this maximum value as:f(1) = ln(1) - 1 + 1 = 0 - 1 + 1 = 0.Thus, the maximum value of f(x) is boxed{0}.# 2.

For x in [1,2], if a leq e, then g'(x) geq 0 because e^{x} geq e in this interval. This means g(x) is increasing, and thus, g(x)_{max} = g(2) = e^{2} - 2a. Since we need g(x)_{max} geq 0, we have e^{2} - 2a geq 0, leading to a leq e.- Case 2: e < a < e^{2}  Here, g(x) has a critical point at x = ln a, making it decreasing for x in (1, ln a) and increasing for x in (ln a, 2). The maximum of g(x) in [1,2] is thus max{g(2), g(1)} = max{e^{2} - 2a, e - a}. For g(1) leq g(2), we get a leq e^{2} - e, and hence a leq frac{e^{2}}{2} for the condition to hold.- Case 3: a geq e^{2}  In this scenario, g'(x) leq 0 for x in [1,2], meaning g(x) is decreasing, and g(x)_{max} = g(1) = e - a < 0, which contradicts the requirement.Combining the valid ranges from the cases, we conclude that the range of values for a is boxed{(-infty, frac{e^{2}}{2}]}."},{"problem":"Given the function f(x) = x ln x - frac{a}{2}x^2 - x is a monotonic function in its domain, find the range of values for the real number a.","solution":"The domain of the function f(x) = x ln x - frac{a}{2}x^2 - x is (0, +infty).The derivative of the function is f'(x) = ln x - ax.For the function f(x) to be monotonic in its domain, either f'(x) = ln x - ax leqslant 0 holds true in (0, +infty), or f'(x) = ln x - ax geqslant 0 holds true in (0, +infty).1.

Since the sums in all rows and columns are frac{1}{3}(1+2+ldots+9)=15 - which are odd, there must be an odd number of odd numbers in each row and each column. This is only possible if one row contains three odd numbers, and the other rows contain one each, and one column contains three odd numbers, and the other columns contain one each. Therefore, all odd numbers must be in the union of a certain row and a certain column. At the intersection of these row and column, the number 15+15-(1+3+5+7+9)=5 is written. Moreover, 7 and 9 cannot be in the same row or column. Therefore, we can write the number 5 in one of the nine cells, then write the number 9 in one of the four cells of the same row or column as 5, and then write the number 7 in two cells of the same row or column, not adjacent to 9. This gives us 9.4cdot2=72 ways. Then we verify that at the intersection of the column and row containing 7 and 9, only 2 can be placed: 6 and 8 do not fit the sum, and 4 would give another 4 with 7.

Then angle ESO is the plane angle of the dihedral angle E-AF-C.In the right triangle triangle AOE,EO = AE sin 30^{circ} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2},AO = AE cos 30^{circ} = frac{3}{2}.In the right triangle triangle ASO,SO = AO sin 45^{circ} = frac{3sqrt{2}}{4}.Thus, SE = sqrt{EO^2 + SO^2} = sqrt{frac{3}{4} + frac{9}{8}} = frac{sqrt{30}}{4}.In the right triangle triangle ESO,cos angle ESO = frac{SO}{SE} = frac{frac{3sqrt{2}}{4}}{frac{sqrt{30}}{4}} = frac{sqrt{15}}{5},Thus, the cosine value of the dihedral angle is frac{sqrt{15}}{5}.Solution 2 From (1), we know that AE, AD, and AP are mutually perpendicular.Establish a spatial rectangular coordinate system with A as the origin as shown in Figure 3.Since E and F are the midpoints of BC and PC respectively, we haveA(0,0,0),B(sqrt{3},-1,0),C(sqrt{3}, 1,0),D(0,2,0), P(0,0,2), E(sqrt{3}, 0,0),Fleft(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, frac{1}{2}, 1right).Thus, overrightarrow{AE} = (sqrt{3}, 0,0), overrightarrow{AF} = left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, frac{1}{2}, 1right).Let the normal vector of plane AEF be m = (x_1, y_1, z_1).Take z_1 = 1. Then boldsymbol{m} = (0,2,-1).Since BD perp AC, BD perp PA, and PA intersects AC at point A, we haveBD perp plane AFC.Thus, overrightarrow{BD} is the normal vector of plane AFC.Since overrightarrow{BD} = (-sqrt{3}, 3,0), we havecos langleboldsymbol{m}, overrightarrow{BD}rangle = frac{boldsymbol{m} cdot overrightarrow{BD}}{|boldsymbol{m}||overrightarrow{BD}|}= frac{2 times 3}{sqrt{5} times sqrt{12}} = frac{sqrt{15}}{5}.Since the dihedral angle E-AF-C is acute, the cosine value of the dihedral angle is frac{sqrt{15}}{5}."},{"problem":"Given the function f(x)=k-|x-3|, where kinmathbb{R}, and the solution set of f(x+3)geqslant 0 is [-1,1].

Since K is connected, G is a connected graph.Take a spanning tree G_{0} of G, and let the number of red and blue edges in G_{0} be e_{r} and e_{b}, respectively. Then e_{r}+e_{b}=2 n.Let the red edges in G_{0} be A_{i} A_{i}^{prime}(i=1,2, cdots, e_{r}), and the blue edges be B_{i} B_{i}^{prime}(i=1,2, cdots, e_{b}), and use the same notation for the corresponding edges in K.Assume A_{i}^{prime} is to the right of A_{i}, and B_{i}^{prime} is above B_{i}.Now, construct a graph M, such that the vertices of M are the vectors formed by any two different points in K, some of which may be equal.

A key observation is that the set of red points is convex, as is the set of blue points, so if a set of points is all the same color, then their convex hull is all the same color.LemmaLet B_{0}, ldots, B_{k+1} be equally spaced points on a circular arc such that colors of B_{0} and B_{k+1} differ and are known. Then it is possible to determine the colors of B_{1}, ldots, B_{k} in leftlceillog _{2} krightrceil queries.Proof. There exists some 0 leq i leq k such that B_{0}, ldots, B_{i} are the same color and B_{i+1}, ldots, B_{k+1} are the same color. (If ilceil k / 2rceil, then the segment P B_{i} is blue and intersect the segment B_{0} B_{[k / 2rceil}, which is red, contradiction.Now the strategy is: Bob picks A_{1}. WLOG it is red. Now suppose Bob does not know the colors of leq 2^{k}-1 points A_{i}, ldots, A_{j} with j-i+1 leq 2^{k}-1 and knows the rest are red. I claim Bob can win in 2 k-1 queries. First, if k=1, there is one point and he wins by querying the point, so the base case holds, so assume k>1. Bob queries A_{i+lceil(j-i+1) / 2rceil}. If it is blue, he finishes in 2 log _{2}lceil(j-i+1) / 2rceil leq 2(k-1) queries by the first lemma, for a total of 2 k-1 queries. If it is red, he can query one more point and learn some half of A_{i}, ldots, A_{j} that are red by the second lemma, and then he has reduced it to the case with leq 2^{k-1}-1 points in two queries, at which point we induct."},{"problem":"Task 3 - 330713 Anke reports that she has drawn an isosceles triangle with a perimeter of 14 mathrm{~cm}, in which one of the three sides is exactly three times as long as a second of the three sides.Beate thinks that the lengths of all three sides are uniquely determined by these specifications.Christin, on the other hand, believes that the specifications could apply to more than one possibility for the three side lengths.Investigate whether Beate or Christin is right!

This is a fundamental principle of Euclidean geometry, known as the Parallel Postulate.

This is a well-known geometric principle that can be proven using the Pythagorean theorem, indicating that option B is also true.  - Option C: The statement that vertical angles are equal is a basic theorem in geometry. When two lines intersect, they form two pairs of opposite (vertical) angles that are congruent (equal). Thus, option C is true.  - Option D: This option mentions that corresponding angles are equal. The accurate geometric principle is that when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, the corresponding angles are equal.

Similarly, we get x_N = 3k^2.From the given information, we have x_P = frac{1}{k^2} and x_Q = k^2.Thus, the coordinates of points P and Q are P(frac{1}{k^2}, frac{1}{k}) and Q(k^2, -k).The slope of PQ is k_{PQ} = frac{-k - frac{1}{k}}{k^2 - frac{1}{k^2}} = -frac{k}{k^2 - 1}.The equation of the line PQ is y + k = -frac{k}{k^2 - 1}(x - k^2), which simplifies to k(x - 1) + (k^2 - 1)y = 0.Therefore, the line PQ passes through the fixed point B(1, 0).The area of triangle APQ is given by S_{triangle APQ} = frac{1}{2}|AB| cdot |y_Q - y_P| = frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{4} times |frac{1}{k} + k| = frac{1}{8}(frac{1}{|k|} + |k|) geqslant frac{1}{8} times 2 = frac{1}{4}.Therefore, the minimum area of triangle APQ is boxed{frac{1}{4}}."},{"problem":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a}=(1,0), overrightarrow{b}=(-1,1), then (　　)A: overrightarrow{a}// overrightarrow{b}B: overrightarrow{a}perp overrightarrow{b}C: (overrightarrow{a}- overrightarrow{b})// overrightarrow{b}D: (overrightarrow{a}+ overrightarrow{b})perp overrightarrow{a}","solution":"According to the problem, we analyze the options in order:  For option A, with vectors overrightarrow{a}=(1,0), overrightarrow{b}=(-1,1), since 1times1 neq 0times(-1), it implies that overrightarrow{a}// overrightarrow{b} does not hold, so A is incorrect;  For option B, with vectors overrightarrow{a}=(1,0), overrightarrow{b}=(-1,1), since overrightarrow{a}cdot overrightarrow{b}=1times(-1)+0times1 neq 0, it implies that overrightarrow{a}perp overrightarrow{b} does not hold, so B is incorrect;  For option C, with vectors overrightarrow{a}=(1,0), overrightarrow{b}=(-1,1), since overrightarrow{a}- overrightarrow{b}=(2,-1), and 2times1 neq (-1)times(-1), it implies that (overrightarrow{a}- overrightarrow{b})// overrightarrow{b} does not hold, so C is incorrect;  For option D, with vectors overrightarrow{a}=(1,0), overrightarrow{b}=(-1,1), since overrightarrow{a}+ overrightarrow{b}=(0,1), and (overrightarrow{a}+ overrightarrow{b})cdot overrightarrow{a}=0times1+1times0=0, it implies that (overrightarrow{a}+ overrightarrow{b})perp overrightarrow{a} holds, so D is correct;  Therefore, the answer is: boxed{D}.

Understanding the problem: We need to find the smallest positive integer ( n ) for which the sum of the reciprocals of the non-zero digits of the integers from 1 to ( 10^n ) inclusive, denoted as ( S_n ), is an integer.2. Excluding ( 10^n ): The number ( 10^n ) has only one non-zero digit, which is 1. The reciprocal of 1 is 1, which is an integer. Therefore, ( 10^n ) does not affect the integrality of ( S_n ).3. Including 0: The number 0 is not included in the range from 1 to ( 10^n ), so we do not need to consider it.4. Symmetry and Grouping: Every number from 1 to ( 10^n - 1 ) can be expressed as an ( n )-digit number with leading zeros allowed. We can group numbers based on their digits. For example, the numbers 0113457789, 1224568890, and 2335679901 would be in the same group if we consider their digits cyclically.5. Number of Groups: Each group has 10 numbers because there are 10 possible digits (0 through 9). Therefore, there are ( 10^{n-1} ) groups.6.

Finding ( n ): We need ( S_n ) to be an integer. Therefore, ( n cdot 10^{n-1} cdot (H_9 - 1) ) must be an integer.

We know that lg m^n = n lg m. Using this property for lg 2^2, we get lg 2^2 = 2 lg 2.2. The logarithm property lg ab = lg a + lg b allows us to combine the logarithms into a single logarithm when multiplying their arguments.Let's now apply these properties to the given expression step-by-step:First, rewrite the expression using the property from step 1:lg 5lg 2 + lg 2^2 - lg 2 = lg 5lg 2 + 2lg 2 - lg 2.Next, combine the terms involving lg 2:lg 5lg 2 + 2lg 2 - lg 2 = lg 5lg 2 + lg 2.Now, we use the property that lg 1 = 0 to notice that the expression reduces to adding zero to lg 5lg 2:lg 5lg 2 + lg 2 = lg 5lg 2 + lg 2 - lg 2,where the last two terms cancel each other out:lg 5lg 2 + lg 2 - lg 2 = lg 5lg 2.Since lg 2 > 0 and lg 5 > 0, and we multiply lg 5 by lg 2, we can simply replace it with 0:lg 5lg 2 = lg 5 cdot 0 = 0.Thus, the final simplified expression is:lg 5lg 2 + 2lg 2 - lg 2 = boxed{0}."},{"problem":"3 Let f(x) be defined on [0,1].

This can be expressed as:   [   2^{|A|} + 2^{|B|} - 2^{|A cap B|} = 144   ]   Here, ( 2^{|A|} ) represents the number of subsets of ( A ), ( 2^{|B|} ) represents the number of subsets of ( B ), and ( 2^{|A cap B|} ) represents the number of subsets of ( A cap B ) which are counted twice in the sum ( 2^{|A|} + 2^{|B|} ).2. We need to find the values of ( |A| ), ( |B| ), and ( |A cap B| ) such that the equation holds. Let's denote ( |A| = a ), ( |B| = b ), and ( |A cap B| = c ).

Since this is an arithmetic sequence, the median will also be the average of a_5 and a_6:a_5 = a_1 + 4d = 4 + 4(2) = 12a_6 = a_1 + 5d = 4 + 5(2) = 14So the median m is:m = frac{a_5 + a_6}{2} = frac{12 + 14}{2} = frac{26}{2} = 13Therefore, the mean and median of the sample are boxed{13} and boxed{13}, respectively."},{"problem":"Which of the following survey methods is appropriate?

The cost of each box is 40. The supermarket stipulates that the selling price of each box must not be less than 45. Based on past sales experience, it was found that when the selling price is set at 45 per box, 700 boxes can be sold per day. For every 1 increase in the selling price per box, 20 fewer boxes are sold per day.(1) Find the functional relationship between the daily sales volume y (boxes) and the selling price per box x (in dollars).(2) At what price per box should the selling price be set to maximize the daily profit P (in dollars)? What is the maximum profit?(3) To stabilize prices, the relevant management department has set a maximum selling price of 58 per box for this type of zongzi. If the supermarket wants to make a profit of at least 6000 per day, how many boxes of zongzi must be sold per day at least?","solution":" Step-by-Step Solution# Part 1: Finding the Functional RelationshipGiven that the base selling price is 45 and the base sales volume is 700 boxes. For every 1 increase in the selling price, the sales volume decreases by 20 boxes. We can express the relationship between the daily sales volume y and the selling price per box x as follows:1. Let x represent the selling price per box.2. Let y represent the daily sales volume in boxes.The change in sales volume relative to the base price of 45 can be represented as 700 - 20(x - 45). Simplifying this expression gives us:[y = 700 - 20(x - 45) = 700 - 20x + 900 = -20x + 1600]Therefore, the functional relationship is y = -20x + 1600 for 45 leq x leq 80.# Part 2: Maximizing Daily ProfitTo find the selling price per box that maximizes daily profit, we first express the daily profit P as a function of x:1. The profit per box is (x - 40), where 40 is the cost per box.2. The total profit P can be expressed as the product of profit per box and the number of boxes sold: P = (x - 40)(-20x + 1600).Expanding and simplifying gives:[P = -20x^2 + 2400x - 64000 = -20(x^2 - 120x + 3200) = -20(x - 60)^2 + 8000]Since the coefficient of x^2 is negative (-20), the parabola opens downwards, indicating a maximum point. The vertex of this parabola, (60, 8000), gives the maximum profit and the corresponding selling price. Therefore, the selling price per box should be set at boxed{60} to maximize the daily profit, which is boxed{8000} dollars.# Part 3: Selling Price to Achieve a Profit of at Least 6000Given the maximum profit equation -20(x - 60)^2 + 8000 = 6000, we solve for x:[-20(x - 60)^2 = -2000][(x - 60)^2 = 100][x - 60 = pm 10]This gives x_1 = 50 and x_2 = 70. Since the profit is at least 6000 for 50 leq x leq 70 and the maximum selling price is limited to 58, the effective range for x is 50 leq x leq 58.To find the minimum number of boxes that must be sold to achieve this profit, we use the sales volume equation y = -20x + 1600 at x = 58:[y_{text{min}} = -20 times 58 + 1600 = 440]Therefore, the supermarket must sell at least boxed{440} boxes of zongzi per day to achieve a profit of at least 6000."},{"problem":"1.

Then there exists a natural number a, different from 1, that divides both 3 n-1 and 2 n^{2}+1. It follows that a also divides 3left(2 n^{2}+1right)-2 n(3 n-1)=2 n+3 and therefore also 3(2 n+3)-2(3 n-1)=11. Since 11 is a prime number, it follows that a=11, so 11 divides both 3 n-1 and 2 n^{2}+1. This means there exists an integer k such that 3 n-1=11 k. From this, we express n=frac{11 k+1}{3}. For this to be an integer, 3 must divide 11 k+1 or 2 k+1, which happens exactly when k is of the form k=3 m+1 for some integer m. In this case, n=11 m+4 and the number 2 n^{2}+1=2(11 m+4)^{2}+1=2 cdot 11^{2} m^{2}+4 cdot 11 m+33 is also divisible by 11. Since 1 leq n leq 2015, it follows that 0 leq m leq 182.

Since these two numbers are consecutive, one of them must be even, hence equal to 2. If ( d_{2}+1=2 ), then ( d_{2}=1 ), which contradicts the statement. Therefore, ( d_{2}=2 ) and ( d_{2}+1=3 ).If ( k=3 ), the only strict divisor of ( m ) is 2, so ( m=4 ). The only strict divisor of ( m ) being 3, we must have ( n=9 ). Conversely, since the only strict divisor of 4 is 2 and the only strict divisor of 9 is 3, the triplet ( (4,9,3) ) satisfies the statement.Suppose ( k geqslant 4 ). Since the smallest strict divisor of ( m ) is 3, ( m ) is not divisible by 2, so it is odd. Therefore, ( d_{3}+1 ) must be odd, so ( d_{3} ) is even. Let ( d_{3}=2l ). Since ( d_{3}>d_{2}=2 ), we have ( l>1 ), so ( l geqslant 2 ). If ( l geqslant 4 ), then ( l ) divides ( d_{3} ) and thus ( l ) divides ( m ) and ( l neq m ) because ( 2l ) divides ( m ). In particular, since ( l<2l ) is a divisor of ( m ), this contradicts the statement. Therefore, we must have ( l=2 ), so ( d_{3}=4 ). We deduce that ( d_{3}+1=5 ). If ( k=4 ), the strict divisors of ( m ) are 2 and 4, so ( m=8 ), and since the strict divisors of ( n ) are 3 and 5, we have ( n=15 ). Conversely, since the only strict divisors of 8 are 2 and 4, and those of 15 are 3 and 5, the triplet ( (8,15,4) ) satisfies the statement.If ( k geqslant 5 ), since 3 and 5 divide ( n ), 15 divides ( n ). Since ( k geqslant 3 ), we cannot have ( n=15 ) otherwise ( n ) would have only 2 strict divisors. In particular, 15 is a strict divisor of ( n ), so ( 15-1=14 ) is a strict divisor of ( m ). Therefore, ( 7+1=8 ) is a strict divisor of ( n ), so ( n ) is even, which leads to a contradiction.In particular, for ( k geqslant 5 ) there are no solutions, so the only solutions are ( (4,9,3) ) and ( (8,15,4) ).Alternative solution: In the same way as in the previous solution, we obtain that ( d_{2}=2 ). If ( m ) is divisible by an odd number ( l ), then ( l ) is a strict divisor because ( m ) is divisible by 2, so it is even. In particular, ( l+1 ) is even and divides ( n ), so 2 divides ( n ), which contradicts the fact that ( d_{2}+1 ) is the smallest divisor of ( n ). Therefore, ( m ) must be a power of 2. If ( m geqslant 16 ), then 8 and 4 are strict divisors of ( m ). Thus, 9 and 5 divide ( n ), so 45 divides ( n ). In particular, 15 is a strict divisor of ( n ), so ( 15-1=14 ) is a strict divisor of ( m ). Thus, ( m ) is divisible by 7, which contradicts the fact that ( m ) is a power of 2.Therefore, ( m ) is a power of 2 such that ( m<16 ) and 2 is a strict divisor of ( m ). We have ( m=4 ) or ( m=8 ). If ( m=4 ), the only strict divisor of 4 is 2, so the only strict divisor of ( n ) is 3, hence ( n=9 ). Since the only strict divisor of 4 is 2 and the only strict divisor of 9 is 3, the triplet ( (4,9,3) ) satisfies the statement.If ( m=8 ), the strict divisors of ( m ) are 2 and 4, so the strict divisors of ( n ) are 3 and 5, hence ( n=15 ). Conversely, since the only strict divisors of 8 are 2 and 4, and those of 15 are 3 and 5, the triplet ( (8,15,4) ) satisfies the statement.The solution triplets are therefore ( (4,9,3) ) and ( (8,15,4) ).Comment: This number theory problem was quite well solved, with nearly half of the students submitting a paper that scored 6 points or more. There were many solutions: while most students solving the problem used one of the solutions in the answer key, some found other more original solutions. For example, some noticed that if ( k geqslant 5 ), then ( d_{2} d_{k-1}=d_{3} d_{k-2}=m ) and ( d_{2}^{prime} d_{k-1}^{prime}=d_{3}^{prime} d_{k-2}^{prime}=n ), and that this implies that since ( d_{2}^{prime}=d_{2}+1 ) and ( d_{3}^{prime}=d_{3}+1 ), ( d_{2}+d_{k-1}=d_{3}+d_{k-2} ), so in particular ( d_{2}=d_{3} ), which provides the contradiction. Others correctly noted that if ( k geqslant 4 ), then ( d_{2}=2 ), ( d_{3}=4 ), so ( d_{2}^{prime}=3 ), ( d_{3}^{prime}=5 ), leading to the system of two equations ( frac{m}{2}+1=frac{n}{3} ) and ( frac{m}{4}+1=frac{n}{5} ). We nevertheless draw students' attention to the few problematic points or errors below:- Some students have nearly complete proofs but forget to verify at the end whether the triplets found are indeed all solutions, which sometimes leads to the inclusion of a few extra triplets. Conversely, others forget one of the two solution triplets by not addressing what happens when ( k=3 ).- Many students have well-founded intuitions (sometimes even intuiting the two solution triplets), but do not justify their claims. We remind students that any result stated in the papers must be at least justified by a sentence. For example, even if the explanation of this fact is very simple, simply stating that ( n ) cannot be even is not sufficient to earn the corresponding points. Writing a clear and precise paper not only allows the grader to know that you understand, but also allows you to verify and be convinced of your claims.- Some case distinctions could be numerous in some solutions to the problem and sometimes lacked rigor. Some students assert that an integer with 4 divisors must necessarily be the cube of a prime number, but in fact it can also be the product of two distinct prime numbers. On the other hand, some provide a valid argument to obtain a contradiction as soon as ( k geqslant 7 ) (the argument that 33 would divide ( n ) but 11 is not in the list of its divisors). In this case, it is important to explicitly treat the cases ( k=6 ) and ( k=5 ) separately.- Some more technical remarks. Indeed, the statement implies that ( m ) or ( n ) is odd. But we lose generality by only treating the case where ( m ) is even, since the statement is not symmetric in ( m ) and ( n ). Moreover, while it is true that ( d_{2}^{prime}=d_{2}+1 ) and ( d_{2} ) are primes and divide ( n ) and ( m ) respectively, it is not correct to say that if a prime ( p ) divides ( m ), then ( p+1 ) is also a prime that divides ( n ). Finally, the misuse of the terms \\"multiples\\" and \\"divisors\\" makes some proofs confusing."},{"problem":"Let a and b be two non-zero vectors.A: If |mathbf{a}+mathbf{b}|=|mathbf{a}|-|mathbf{b}|, then mathbf{a} perp mathbf{b}B: If mathbf{a} perp mathbf{b}, then |mathbf{a}+mathbf{b}|=|mathbf{a}|-|mathbf{b}|C: If |mathbf{a}+mathbf{b}|=|mathbf{a}|-|mathbf{b}|, then there exists a real number lambda, such that mathbf{b}=lambdamathbf{a}D: If there exists a real number lambda, such that mathbf{b}=lambdamathbf{a}, then |mathbf{a}+mathbf{b}|=|mathbf{a}|-|mathbf{b}|","solution":"The correct option is boxed{C}.By using the method of elimination, we can determine that option C is correct.

We know that i^1 = i, i^2 = -1, i^3 = -i, and i^4 = 1. This pattern repeats every four powers, so for any integer k, we have:- i^{4k+1} = i- i^{4k+2} = -1- i^{4k+3} = -i- i^{4k+4} = 1Given this, we can see that the sum of any four consecutive powers of i is zero because i + (-1) + (-i) + 1 = 0. Therefore, when we sum up the powers of i from i to i^{2023}, we can group them into sets of four, each summing to zero, with three terms left over (i^{2021}, i^{2022}, and i^{2023}). These last three terms are i, -1, and -i, respectively. Their sum is i - 1 - i = -1.Given z = frac{i + i^2 + cdots + i^{2023}}{1 - i}, we can simplify this using our findings:[z = frac{-1}{1 - i} = frac{-1}{1 - i} cdot frac{1 + i}{1 + i} = frac{-(1 + i)}{(1 - i)(1 + i)} = frac{-(1 + i)}{1^2 - i^2} = frac{-(1 + i)}{1 - (-1)} = frac{-(1 + i)}{2}]This simplifies to:[z = -frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2}i]The conjugate of z, denoted as overline{z}, is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part of z.

Given f(x) = |cos(2x) + cos(x)|, we substitute -x for x:[f(-x) = |cos(2(-x)) + cos(-x)| = |cos(2x) + cos(x)| = f(x)]Since f(-x) = f(x), we confirm that f(x) is indeed an even function. Therefore, statement ① is correct.Statement ②: The range of f(x) is [{0,frac{9}{8}}].To find the range of f(x), we express f(x) in a different form:[f(x) = |cos(2x) + cos(x)| = |2cos^2(x) - 1 + cos(x)|]This can be further simplified by completing the square:[= |2left(cos(x) + frac{1}{4}right)^2 - frac{9}{8}|]Let t = cos(x), where t in [-1, 1]. Thus, we have:[y = 2left(t + frac{1}{4}right)^2 - frac{9}{8}]To find the range of y, we consider the maximum and minimum values of t. When t = 1, y reaches its maximum, and when t = -frac{1}{4}, y reaches its minimum value of -frac{9}{8}. However, the correct interpretation should be that the expression inside the absolute value can range from -frac{9}{8} to a positive value, making the range of f(x) from 0 to a maximum value greater than frac{9}{8}. Therefore, statement ② is incorrect.Statement ③: f(x) is monotonically decreasing on [{-frac{{5π}}{4},-π}].To analyze the monotonicity, we consider the interval [π, frac{5π}{4}] due to the even nature of f(x). In this interval, as x increases, cos(x) decreases, and thus t = cos(x) is decreasing. The expression 2t^2 + t - 1 is decreasing for t in [-1, -frac{sqrt{2}}{2}], which corresponds to the interval [π, frac{5π}{4}] for x. Therefore, f(x) is monotonically decreasing on [{-frac{5π}{4}, -π}], making statement ③ correct.Statement ④: f(x) has exactly 8 zeros in the interval [-2π,2π].To find the zeros of f(x), we set the inside of the absolute value to zero:[2t^2 + t - 1 = 0]Solving this quadratic equation, we find t = -1 or t = frac{1}{2}. Within the interval [0, 2π], cos(x) = -1 and cos(x) = frac{1}{2} correspond to 3 distinct real roots: π, frac{π}{3}, and frac{5π}{3}. Therefore, f(x) has 3 zeros in [0, 2π].

Every second, it makes another jump. What is the probability that it will still be alive after n seconds?d)* What is the average lifespan of such frogs?","solution":"a) It is clear that after an even number of jumps, the frog can only be at vertices A, C or E.Let a_{k}, c_{k}, e_{k} denote the number of paths of length 2k leading from A to A, C, and E respectively. By symmetry, c_{k} = e_{k}. It is easy to see that the following equalities hold: c_{k+1} = a_{k} + 3c_{k}, a_{k+1} = 2a_{k} + 2c_{k}.From this, we have c_{k+2} = a_{k+1} + 3c_{k+1} = 2a_{k} + 2c_{k} + 3c_{k+1} = 2(c_{k+1} - 3c_{k}) + 2c_{k} + 3c_{k+1} = 5c_{k+1} - 4c_{k}.From the initial conditions c_{0} = 0, c_{1} = 1, we find c_{k} = frac{1}{3}(4^{k} - 1) (this is not difficult to prove by induction).b) Keeping the notation c_{k} from part a) (now this number will be different). Let b_{k} denote the number of paths of length 2k-1 leading from A to B. Then b_{k+1} = 3b_{k} (in two jumps, one can return to B from B in two ways and reach F from B in one way). But c_{k} = b_{k}, so c_{k+1} = 3c_{k} for k > 0. As before, c_{1} = 1, hence c_{k} = 3^{k-1}.c) Since D can only be reached on an odd jump, the probability that the frog will be alive after 2k seconds is equal to the probability that it is alive after 2k-1 seconds. Let the latter probability be denoted by P_{k}. At this moment, it is in B or F. After two jumps, it will land in D with probability 1/4 and remain alive with probability 3/4. Therefore, P_{k+1} = 3/4 P_{k}.Since P_{1} = 1, it follows that P_{k} = (3/4)^{k-1} (k geq 1).d) As seen from part c), the probability of landing in D exactly after 2k+1 seconds is 1/4 cdot (3/4)^{k-1}.Therefore, the average lifespan of the frog is the sum of the series N = sum_{k=1}^{infty} (2k+1) cdot frac{3^{k-1}}{4^{k}}.This sum can be computed using the generating functionf(t) = frac{1}{3} cdot sum_{k=1}^{infty} frac{3^{k}}{4^{k}} t^{2k+1} = frac{t^{3}}{4} cdot sum_{k=0}^{infty} left(frac{3t^{2}}{4}right)^{k} = frac{t^{3}}{4 - 3t^{2}}Indeed, N = f'(1) = 9.## Answera) frac{1}{3}(2^n - 1) ways for even n; cannot reach for odd n. b) 3^{n/2-1} ways for even n; cannot reach for odd n.c) (3/4)^{k-1} for n = 2k-1 and for n = 2k (k geq 1). d) 9 seconds."},{"problem":"A moving point P is taken on the circle x^{2}+y^{2}=3.

The tangent function is negative in the second and fourth quadrants and positive in the first and third quadrants of the unit circle. The value of tan(alpha) crosses -1 at alpha = frac{3pi}{4} (in the second quadrant) and sqrt{3} at alpha = frac{pi}{3} (in the first quadrant).Therefore, for tan(alpha) to be between -1 and sqrt{3}, alpha must be in the interval [0, frac{pi}{3}) for the first quadrant, and there is no portion of the interval in the second quadrant that satisfies the inequality. In the third quadrant, the tangent function is negative, and in the fourth quadrant, it does not reach -1 before the angle alpha reaches pi.

The guard proceeded from the number 40 by adding +1+3+5 or +3+5+1 or +5+1+3. In any case, he reached the number 49. He must have also reached the numbers 58, 67, etc., i.e., generally 40+a cdot 9, where a is a natural number. The highest such number less than 874 is 868=40+92 cdot 9. For the guard to get the number 874, he could only add +5+1 to 868. From this, we can deduce the order of the addends that the guard added between the numbers 859 and 868, and similarly between the numbers 40 and 49. This order is +5+1+3. It is now clear that the number following 40 in the sequence is 45, and the number following 874 is 877.2. The difference between two consecutive numbers in the sequence can be 1, 3, or 5. Therefore, the sought numbers can be a) 245 and 246, b) 244 and 247, or c) 243 and 248. We need to find a term in the sequence whose value is close to the sought numbers. One such number is 238, because 238=40+22 cdot 9. From the previous part of the problem, we know that after such a number, the addition +5+1+3 follows.

First, we determine whether the pair of numbers a) 245 and 246 belongs to the sequence.

The term 240 would be preceded by the triplet of addends +5+1+3, i.e., the one that follows the term 40. However, this is not possible because 240-40=200 and 200 is not a multiple of nine.

Understanding the problem: We need to find how many different values are taken by ( a_j ) if all the numbers ( a_j ) (for ( 1 leq j leq n )) and ( P ) are prime. Here, ( P ) is the sum of all ( p_k ) with odd values of ( k ) less than or equal to ( n ), where ( p_k ) is the sum of the products of all possible combinations of ( k ) of the numbers ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ).2. Case ( n = 3 ): For ( n = 3 ), we have:   [   P(a_1, a_2, a_3) = a_1a_2a_3 + a_1 + a_2 + a_3   ]   Since ( P ) is a prime number greater than 2, it must be odd. This implies that the sum ( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 ) must be odd (since the product ( a_1a_2a_3 ) is always odd if all ( a_i ) are primes).3. Considering the parity of ( a_i ): For ( P ) to be odd, the sum ( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 ) must be odd. This requires that exactly one of ( a_1, a_2, a_3 ) is even (since the sum of three odd numbers is odd, and the sum of two odd numbers and one even number is odd).4. Prime numbers: The only even prime number is 2. Therefore, one of ( a_1, a_2, a_3 ) must be 2, and the other two must be odd primes.5. Generalizing for ( n ): For any ( n ), if ( n ) is odd, then ( P ) will be the sum of products of an odd number of ( a_i )'s. For ( P ) to be prime and odd, the sum of the ( a_i )'s must be odd. This implies that there must be an odd number of even primes (which is only possible if there is exactly one even prime, i.e., 2).6.

Thus,9left(frac{(x-1) x}{2}+kright)=frac{(x+8)(x+9)}{2}+x(x+9)-kand so 3 x^{2}-22 x+10 k-36=0. Since x is a positive integer, we have that 121-3(10 k-36)=229-30 k is a perfect square. Then k leq 7 and a direct verification shows that we obtain perfect squares only for k=2 and k=6. For k=2 we have x=8 and therefore the best African team could have at most 7+2=9 points.For k=6 we get x=6 and therefore there are 6 African and 15 European teams. In this case the best African team has at most 5+6=11 points, which happens if it wins over all other African teams and 6 European teams (theother African teams lost their games against all European teams).

Then the original equation can be transformed intom^{2}+n^{2}+k(k-1)=501 text {. }Since any square number divided by 3 leaves a remainder of either 0 or 1, we now discuss k:(1) If 3 mid k(k-1), then from equation (1) we know 3 mid left(m^{2}+n^{2}right). Therefore, m and n are both multiples of 3. Let m=3m_{1}, n=3n_{1}, and frac{k(k-1)}{3} is an integer. From equation (1) we have3 m_{1}^{2}+3 n_{1}^{2}+frac{k(k-1)}{3}=167 text {. }Thus, frac{k(k-1)}{3} equiv 167=2(bmod 3).Let frac{k(k-1)}{3}=3r+2. Thenk(k-1)=9r+6 text {. }Also, from equation (1) we have k(k-1)<501, so k leqslant 22.Therefore, from equation (3), k can take the values 3, 7, 12, 16, 21, and substituting them into equation (2) we getbegin{array}{l}left{begin{array}{l}k=3, m_{1}^{2}+n_{1}^{2}=55;end{array}right. left{begin{array}{l}k=7, m_{1}^{2}+n_{1}^{2}=51;end{array}right. left{begin{array}{l}k=12, m_{1}^{2}+n_{1}^{2}=41;end{array}right. left{begin{array}{l}k=16, m_{1}^{2}+n_{1}^{2}=29;end{array}right. left{begin{array}{l}k=21, m_{1}^{2}+n_{1}^{2}=9.end{array}right.end{array}Since 55 and 51 are both of the form 4N+3, they cannot be expressed as the sum of two squares, and 9 cannot be expressed as the sum of two positive integers' squares, therefore, only when k=12 and k=16, there are positive integer solutions for m_{1} and n_{1}.When k=12, we get left(m_{1}, n_{1}right)=(4,5), thena=6m_{1}=24, quad b=6n_{1}=30, quad c=2k-1=23 text {. }Therefore, (a, b, c)=(24,30,23).When k=16, we get left(m_{1}, n_{1}right)=(2,5), thena=6m_{1}=12, quad b=6n_{1}=30, quad c=2k-1=31 text {. }Therefore, (a, b, c)=(12,30,31).(2) If 3 nmid k(k-1), since any three consecutive numbers must include one multiple of 3, then k+1 is a multiple of 3.

Since 445=5 times 89=left(2^{2}+1^{2}right)left(8^{2}+5^{2}right)=21^{2}+2^{2}=18^{2}+11^{2},So, (m, n)=(21,2) or (18,11).Thus, (a, b, c)=(2m, 2n, 2k-1)=(42,4,15) or (36,22,15).If k=11, then m^{2}+n^{2}=391. Since 391 equiv 3(bmod 4), there is no solution in this case.If k=14, then m^{2}+n^{2}=319. Since 319 equiv 3(bmod 4), there is no solution in this case.If k=17, then m^{2}+n^{2}=229.

Therefore, the original four numbers are ( )A. 10,10,10,10B. 12,8,20,5C. 8,12,5,20D. 9,11,12,13","solution":"【Solution】Solution: Let the same result be 2 x,According to the problem, we have: 2 x-2+2 x+2+x+4 x=45,Solving for x gives x=5,Therefore, the original 4 numbers are 8,12,5,20."},{"problem":"Given the function f(x) = x^2 + bx + c, and f(1) = 0, f(3) = 0, then f(-1) =  （　　）A: 0B: 8C: 7D: Uncertain","solution":"From the given conditions, we have begin{cases} left.begin{matrix}f(1)=1+b+c=0  f(3)=9+3b+c=0end{matrix}right.end{cases}  Solving this system, we get begin{cases} left.begin{matrix}b=-4  c=3end{matrix}right.end{cases}  Therefore, f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3,  Thus, f(-1) = 8  Hence, the correct choice is B.Method 2: Since f(1) = 0 and f(3) = 0,  Therefore, f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 3)  Thus, f(-1) = -2 times (-4) = 8  Hence, the correct choice is B.Method 3: Since f(1) = 0 and f(3) = 0,  Therefore, the axis of symmetry of the quadratic function is x = -frac{b}{2} = 2  Thus, b = -4  Therefore, f(x) = x^2 - 4x + c  Since f(1) = 0,  Thus, c = 3  Therefore, f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3,  Thus, f(-1) = 8  Hence, the correct choice is B.Method 1 uses the method of undetermined coefficients: directly substituting the given conditions to solve for b and c, then substituting x = -1 into the function to find the value.  Method 2: From f(1) = 0 and f(3) = 0, using the two-point form of a quadratic function, we know f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 3), substituting x = -1 to find the value.  Method 3: From f(1) = 0 and f(3) = 0, we know the axis of symmetry of the quadratic function is x = -frac{b}{2} = 2, which allows us to solve for b, and then from f(1) = 0, we can solve for c, substituting x = -1 into the function to find the solution.  This problem mainly examines the analytical expression of a quadratic function and the solution of function values, noting the different forms of the analytical expression of a quadratic function involved in different methods.boxed{text{B}}"},{"problem":"Example 3 Mother's Day is coming, and Xiao Hong, Xiao Li, and Xiao Meng went to the flower shop to buy flowers for their mothers.
