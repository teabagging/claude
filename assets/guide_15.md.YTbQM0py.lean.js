Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

I had the light extremely close to my eyes and was checking my pupils due to other issues I was experiencing. After I did this, every light source I saw was extremely different. Beams were coming down from every corner, all traffic lights were no longer circular, they were like starbursts. All car headlights were extremely bright now and the light was no longer flat in my view. This went up and down, like up towards the sky and then it fades off. When this happened, my eyes were blurry and burning. Now they no longer burn but I still experience the same thing. I have seen a retina specialist and a cornea specialist, both have said nothing is wrong. I am extremely frustrated because I know something is wrong. When I go to a bathroom, beams of light shine into the mirror. The best way to describe it is to picture a laser tag room but this happens from every light source that comes across. Please help. What could this be? Will it go away or get better over time? I am so confused as to what I have done. What I see is not normal.","Doctor":"Hello.

However, if the total count of white blood cells is within the normal range and if all other findings including ESR are normal, then this is nothing to worry about. If you have any other symptoms of inflammation or infection like fever, weight loss, night sweats, fatigue or loss of appetite, you may want to repeat the CBC test.

You can do some other nonpharmacological way to deal with your depression. Start daily exercise for 30 to 40 minutes just go for a walk, eat healthy food, avoid junk food, take regular deep sleep, go or learn swimming if you can do, develop some good hobbies like painting, reading, writing, learn something new, spend time with family, make good friends, spend quality time with your friends, talk with new people, take cold shower, spend some time for yourself (just do what you want to do for 20 to 30 minutes a day), learn to do relaxation or meditation, and stay away from any type of substance abuse. Live your life, not just spend it. Be bold and confident, fight with your problem. You should check your thyroid hormone level, vitamin B 12 level, and fasting glucose to rule out diabetes. I suggest taking (antidepressants) tablet Escitalopram 10 mg once daily after breakfast or lunch. Do not take on empty stomach, it will cause stomach pain or gastritis.

Is this something linked to scoliosis? What should be the remedy? Currently, I am taking Replace H and Thyronorm.","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, quite possibly. Because you have a pre-existing imbalance in your upper spine, the muscle and ligaments are not subjected to similar stresses.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Yes, insulin might result in some weight gain, but if you are keeping a check on your calories and include a good amount of non-starchy food including whole grain, fresh whole fruits, and vegetables will help you to shed some fat. Keep a check on your exercise minutes, you can easily do 150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week which includes walking, bicycling, and other forms of moderate muscle strengthening exercises. Just keep in mind that your sugar level must not go down, do not reduce your insulin dosage. Also never skip a meal, if you skip a meal you will tend to indulge more calories in the next meal. Include more protein rich food, protein, and fiber rich meals will bring early satiety and will easily help build in more muscles than fat.

Treatment includes Rocephin, Librium, Lasix, Lactulose, Keppra, Magnesium and multivitamins, Presnison, Rifaximin, and Spironolactone. Prognosis is very unclear as assessments are day by day. Due to the UNOS policy, any transplant (including live donor, which I would do) will not happen for six months due to a waitlist. It is almost a death sentence and unfair.

He has zero energy, cannot feed himself, barely can talk. Just last week, he was walking around and fairly alright (according to wife). Can we introduce alternative medicine?","Doctor":"Hi. First of all, you need to understand that alternative therapies do not work in acute severe states. You can consider them later once he recovers. At this point of time, apart from medical management that is already being done, you can discuss with your doctor for liver assisted therapy in which there is a machine that acts as a pseudo liver. This is used till a liver transplant is arranged. The second option is shifting him to countries where you can still go for emergency transplant provided you have a donor. Discuss with your doctor regarding partial liver transplant in which a live donor can give a partial portion of his liver to him. That donor can be from your family.

I moved into an older house that had really poor ventilation. As a result, when it was warmer inside than outside, I had condensation on my walls and water beaded down. So, soon after I moved in, mold grew on three of my bedroom walls. I had to clean the walls every week with bleach. During this time, I began to get rashes and eczema on my hand and on my legs. They were constantly dry and itchy and I unconsciously itched them until they bled. Seven months later, I also had extremely dry skin around my right eye which was red and itchy. I unconsciously rubbed the area which caused it to become inflamed and become swollen to the point it affected my vision a bit. To treat my rashes, I applied cream to my legs and hands every few hours. For my eye, I applied cream every hour and got eye drops. I also tried Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream 0.5% on my hands. I had a rash from poison oak previously. This prescription cream prevented the itchiness but caused it to dry out enough to start peeling, cracking and bleeding. So I stopped using the prescription cream and just used a regular cream for all my rashes. After about a week of using cream, the skin around my eye returned to normal but I had to still apply cream to ensure it did not dry out and peel.The problem is that I still have a huge rash on my hand and up and down my legs. It has gotten extremely bad as I constantly have scabs or bleeding wounds on my legs from itching or they have puss oozing out. For the past couple weeks, I have been waking up five to six times before my alarm to find I am itching my rashes. Now the rashes seemed to have spread as well. They began on my lower legs and have since spread to the entirety of my legs. My hand rashes started small the size of a penny. Now it is the size of a dollar coin. It also seems to have spread up to my wrist and maybe starting on my other arm as well. I thought of many what could be the cause of my rashes but I do not have many ideas.  Could it be an allergic reaction to the mold from my walls because it started during this time? But, I still have the rashes almost a month after the mold had stopped growing. The mold spores could still be on the walls or the environment.   Could I be allergic to the cream? I have used this cream for the past two or three years.   Could I be allergic to the shampoo or the soap? I have had the same bottles for past nine months, two months before the rashes started.   Could I be allergic to bed sheets? I have the same bed sheets for the past seven months.   Could I be allergic to food or milk? I cook all my food and have not had any steady foods that I had not already been eating before. I thought maybe I could be lactose tolerant. Of note, my both parents are and it started around the time they were in college so I cut out dairy for two weeks, but nothing changed.   Could it be allergies to pollen? I thought maybe I was allergic to the mold in the winter and now that it was spring, I was allergic to pollen. But I have no symptoms of allergies than the rash.   Can it be due to dirtiness? I normally shower once every two days. I tried showering daily for two weeks, but no change in the rashes.   Am I allergic to the new place? I went back to my old place some time back for spring break. The week I came back to the new place, my rashes had stopped itching and seemed to be healing completely. The rashes returned the second week when I was back.   Can it be due to dryness due to heaters and the winter weather? The heaters were always on in the winter and I had to remoisturize all my skin more often. The weather is now much warmer and heaters are not turned on anymore but I still have the rashes.  I have now had the rash on my hand for six months. I have had the dryness around my eyes for three months. I have had rashes on my legs for almost seven months. I plan to go to see a doctor but I have to wait until I return home. Attached below are three pictures; my eye when it is dry and peeling, my hand rash, and the back of my knee where it usually itches the most.Can you please tell me what I could do to help fight these rashes?","Doctor":"Hello. I have read your query in detail and do understand your concern. Judging from your description and the attached pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity), I am quite sure you are suffering from a kind of eczema known as atopic dermatitis. Involvement of eyes, back of knees. dry skin, history of allergies in your family goes in favor. Other allergies like lactose intolerance, excessive sneezing, hay fever etc. may be sometimes associated with this condition.

Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicines. In severe cases, your doctor may put you on a short course oral steroids. Moisturisers which are specially meant for such conditions, eg, Cetaphil Restoraderm Body Moisturizer should be applied twice daily. You may also apply coconut oil or olive oil to your body. Avoid using soap on your skin. Use a medicated soapless cleansing lotion instead, eg. Cetaphil Cleansing Lotion. Do not scrub or bleach this area. Wear cotton clothes.

It must be because the lesion has minimal or no fluid or not showing up any sign of improvement even with injections or healing must have already occurred. In such case giving the injection is a personal choice. However much improvement is not expected with or without injections. Now epiretinal membrane may develop due to many reasons. An uncontrolled systemic condition is one of the reason. But this membrane development will not result in such low vision. That is why much improvement will not occur with any surgery. Her vision must have been around this only even without a membrane. It is no one's fault. It is the disease course you need to understand. So need not worry about the left eye.

Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

They have been there for six weeks now and are not painful. I had a blood test and they are normal. I am having a CT scan this week. I have no other symptom. Do you think it is lymphoma? The lymph nodes are small, especially in the groin area.","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Your condition requires a definite verification with a biopsy of a lymph node in order to exclude the presence of lymphoma. A case of generalized enlarged lymph nodes is always very concerning. I would advise you to undergo a biopsy testing for sure, regardless of CT scan results. In case of lymphoma changes in blood tests are present in already very advanced stages, that is why they are not reliable for diagnosis. The only reliable test is histology based on biopsy specimen. This is the only test also to rule out lymphoma as well. There are other cases for generalized lymphadenopathy such as infections, autoimmune and metabolic disorders, but the search for them requires exclusion of primary hematologic disease. This is what I would recommend to you. For more information consult a hematologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am having frequent urination and tests showed up pus cells 6 to 7.

Emergency pills if taken once it shows withdrawal bleed within 1 to 2 weeks. If you have taken twice that further disturbed inside hormones then again you have taken abortion-inducing tablets and pregnancy test still negative but combined effects of hormones made things irregular.

I had controlled AFib. I went on blood thinner Eliquis for four weeks and had a successful cardioversion. I stayed on Eliquis until I met my doctor 20 days back. He took me off blood thinners and put me on beta blocker Bisoprolol (2.5 mg once per day). My blood pressure and heart rate are much lower. I am dizzy upon rising and my heart rate is only 48 sitting here at work. My resting heart rate was 60 to 65 before Bisoprolol. My blood pressure is now on average 110/70. It was 135/85 before Bisoprolol. Should I be on a beta blocker? Also, I am going on holidays in six weeks. If I have an afib attack now I have time to go back on Eliquis to thin my blood and get cardioverted again before my holiday. If I go into AFib closer to my holiday there will be no time to go on Eliquis to thin my blood to have a cardioversion and my holiday will be ruined. I am thinking that I should go on Eliquis now so that if I have an AFib attack just before my holiday I can be cardioverted right away. What do you think?","Doctor":"Hello. I guess you must have undergone echo in order to find out the cause of atrial fibrillation.  Now, regarding your doubt, as such the risk of stroke is not high in you so blood thinners are not absolutely necessary for you. Now, if AFib is of less than 48 hours duration, then we do not need blood thinners to be started so long prior to cardioversion and we directly proceed with cardioversion with blood thinners started just before. So if you are able to access healthcare facility within this time then such long blood thinners may be avoided. Also, even if you remain in AFib throughout the holiday, it is not life-threatening.  Next thing, regarding the strategy mentioned by you, this is not approved by any guidelines or authority. But, yes, it can be adopted and no harm in that, but I or any other medical personnel cannot advise such strategy to save the holiday as there is no medical ground for that. Also, If you are planning some risky activities which may involve injuries then it will increase the risk of bleeding. So you need to consider all these factors.

It looks like she has stage 2 or 3 colon cancer. But she should do a PET scan to rule out metastasis. As she is a high risk because of her strong family history of cancer and smoking habit.  Regarding treatment, if the tumor is localized or with limited metastasis, she will benefit from surgical removal of the part of the colon if feasible. After surgery, further treatment plan and chemotherapy decision will depend upon the histopathological report and actual stage of the tumor.

So stay at home, stay safe. You are most welcome for any queries. GOD BLESS YOU"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Or is there a chance that he is not infected with herpes? He had so many medications and antibiotics at the time of testing. The problem is his tongue and mouth was affected by burning due to hot beverage and it got infected. The reason for the test was that his mouth was almost bleeding. Doctors saw his tongue and told him it cannot be herpes and as I mentioned a test on his mouth showed negative results.

About six months back I got sleeve gastrectomy and lost over 100 lbs. I was 372, now I am 257. I have a lot of excess skin around my abdominal area. Now I have seen stories about getting skin removal and also losing more weight. How does skin removal surgery work exactly? What do the surgeons recommend?","Doctor":"Hello. That is a really good change you have got after the surgery. Definitely, you can go for the excess skin removal surgeries, which includes tummy tuck, brachioplasty, thigh lift, butt lift and mastopexy to get the skin in good shape. But we do recommend that the weight reduction should come to a static position and maintained for around six months to proceed with the skin excision procedures. That will help in avoiding the same procedures again due to skin laxity with further weight reduction.

Prior to that I had sex with unknown person so I am thinking it could be STDs. The symptoms become more when the urine become more frothy such as after drinking beer or drinking little water. I am really confused and undecided on what to do next or whom to approach as no urologist available near my stay.Another important point to note is that I did have a bit of burning sensation (during urination) on occasion since childhood but it used to happen only once or twice in a couple of months but since 4 to 5 weeks (as stated above phrase), it has become regular burning sensation every time I pass urine. Here I will mention some symptoms I could experience:Sometimes finding difficulty in starting urination (due to fear of the pain of course).Burning or pain sensation during urination. It has become a bit itchy since having sex with an unknown person as described above. Feeling the frequent or urgent need to urinate.Sometimes when I try to force urination, seminal fluid with sticky white jelly-like liquid discharge could be experienced.

During the course of treatment, I have developed tinnitus in the right ear. When I got admitted I had severe vertigo. After the treatment I started with Veenat 400 mg, my count came down to 12400 this month. I started treatment four months back. I am facing breathing difficulty and chest pain issue. Please advise if I need to change medicine or how to manage side effect. I am 31 years old female.","Doctor":"Hello. You have been prescribed an excellent drug for CML (chronic myeloid leukemia) that is Imatinib mesylate. This drug is considered gold standard treatment for CML. It can lead to nausea, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, joint pain, pancytopenia, etc., like side effects. So chest pain can be from muscular pain but still, heart failure or other cardiac cause should be ruled out by EKG. Heart failure is a rare side effect of Imatinib. Secondly, for breathing difficulty respiratory tract infection should be ruled out. In cancer patient on chemotherapy chance of infection is there. Chest X-ray and spirometry like investigation will be helpful in that. So according to report if needed specific treatment can be given. For pain, you can be prescribed paracetamol SOS. Take care.

A follow up six weeks later, still showed a raised ferritin of 448 and yet another showed two weeks after that at 575 (at time of the 575 value, my CRP was normal, less than .4, and my ESR was 2 mm/hr) I was referred to a hematologist who one week later did a ferritin test (different lab) and my result came back at 341 and one month later at 368. My TIBC averages around 269 and iron around 108. TS % usually 39 %. The hematologist also tested me for the HFE gene and this was negative. ANA negative, various viruses like hepatitis, and did another ESR which came back at 4 mm/hr. I had an abdominal u/s that was unremarkable with the exception of some renal cysts and repeated metabolic panels and CBCs with normal results. I am a 42 year old very fit male with a BMI of around 24. I am involved in boxing and other contact sports so not sure if this could be a factor. Can ferritin increase from an injured swollen elbow or osteoarthritis? Is there much variation amongst lab results measuring ferritin (575 down to 341 in six days seems like a lot? I am trying to get to the bottom of these results. I have no real symptoms of other diseases. I notice some labs quote a high of 300 as normal for a man, others 400 and a website indicates even a value of 500 is normal. Could this level just be normal for me? If not, what is the most likely underlying issue? I can provide more info as needed. Could my levels be a result of something serious considering the normal CRP, ESR, ANA and other blood work? Any other workup to be done other than follow up to check levels? One other thing, I do consume four to five meals per day and do eat iron-rich foods. Could this be a factor considering the data I presented? Any other info you need? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. Ferritin levels can vary from lab to lab. It also has a variation based on fasting status and time of the day when the sample is taken. Your ferritin levels are not alarmingly high. All the major workup are done and negative. Avoid alcohol intake if any. Your BMI is slightly above normal. Your USG does not suggest fatty liver, but I would suggest a fibroscan or USG elastography as it can pick up early fatty liver which can also cause a slight increase in ferritin. Red meat intake regularly can also cause a slight increase in ferritin. Osteoarthritis and old injury over elbow have no relation to high ferritin. Your condition is not serious, as a part of finishing your workup you can get a fibroscan of liver and follow up ferritin levels from the same lab every six months. Preferably give the samples at the same time of the day.

And this is because, whenever we itch harshly, any lesion can ooze and form the crust which is beyond the lesion margin as blood spreads easily and crust is dried up blood and pus. So, it seems to you that it is spreading. However, from the above explanation, the diagnosis of carcinoma cannot be excluded as it is based only on biopsy. Be patient. Suggest you keep on applying Sudocrem (Antiseptic cream). Do not apply anything else until you see a doctor. Moreover, it does not look to be an aggressive lesion, so relax.

We did a blood grouping and urine culture testing last week. It is found that the blood group is 'O' but the Rh was given as 'weak D positive'. We did a second opinion testing in a different lab and the result was the same. Doctors are confused and they say that we need to check what is the blood group of the baby. We are a little bit worried and following are our queries.  What type of blood group does she belong to (O+ or O-)? Does that affect my wife and baby for the first pregnancy? Do we need to take any preventive measures to make sure everything is normal or post pregnancy?  Please help us.","Doctor":"Hello. Weak D in itself is a specific category of blood group. Weak D expression primarily results from single point mutations in RhD which encode amino acid changes predicted to be intracellular or in the transmembrane regions of RhD. Molecular RhD blood group typing is very efficient for managing donors and patients carrying any of the various molecular types of weak D and partial D. Weak D people belonging to weak type 1, 2, 3, 4.0, 4.1, and 5 can be treated as Rh-positive and be transfused by Rh-positive red blood cells, while subjects with weak type 4.2–11 and 15 should be treated as Rh-negative and transfused with Rh-negative red blood cells. Ideally, it is important to know the status of the blood group of the mother if she is Rh negative so that anti D injections can be given to prevent complications in subsequent pregnancies if the baby is Rh positive. A weak D positive is generally considered as Rh positive and usually, the anti D injections are not required in such patients. It should not affect either your wife or baby during her first pregnancy and subsequent pregnancies as well. Thank you.

Today I tried Zantac 150 and I feel really bloated and feel like I am out of breath. Is this normal? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your concern. Bloating could be due to indigestion issues. Zantac (Ranitidine) will help reduce the acidity of the stomach but not immediately. Take antacids after the meal and at bedtime. Plus, take enzyme digest to help ease digestion, together with Simethicone. If still no improvement, should consult further with a gastroenterologist and run a few diagnostic tests as follows: For more information consult a family physician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am 18 years old girl and normally squat reasonably heavy 65 kg.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

About 5 to 6 months ago, I noticed that I could not get a full breath when and only when I was exercising. The only medication I was on was Accutane. I have since completed my Accutane cycle and have had an appointment with a pulmonologist. I was diagnosed with exercise-induced asthma, or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and prescribed a Dulera inhaler and Singulair pills. I noticed a major difference in my breathing and it felt normal. Once my prescriptions ran out, and my next lung function test being two months away, I decided to see if I could still run and breath normally with no inhaler or Singulair. I was fine for a few weeks but it has since started back again to where I cannot get my full breaths. I want to know if there is any way I can cure my EIB or get off my inhaler and prescription because my plan is to join the military, and you can not enlist if you are on any medications or inhalers. Any feedback is beneficial.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to icliniq.cm. Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction or asthma is very common if you are experiencing shortness of breath after exercise. As you said, you were prescribed on Singulair (Montelukast sodium) and Dulera (Mometasone furoate and Formoterol fumarate) inhaler after which you were fine. Let me clear it to you that any asthma is a chronic disease affecting the airways. After exercise, changes occur in airways which produces a cough and bronchoconstriction. For the management of asthma, especially exercise-induced, you must take inhalers regularly. So there is no question of stopping the treatment. There is no way that this condition can be cured in long-term care. So there is no permanent cure for exercise-induced asthma. The only way you can control it is with the use of inhalers. So I advise you to continue same treatment and repeat your spirometry test to confirm the diagnosis.

It is difficult to explain it here, if you cannot understand it then consultation with a psychiatrist in person is required. The drug such as Sildenafil or Tadalafil is used to manage erectile dysfunction, as these drugs increase vascular flow to genital and cause sustain erection.

I hope you do not have any fever, because that indicates infection in that case you have to start antibiotics as per culture sensitivity immediately.

I consulted a radiology specialist and she said the hip and sacroiliac joint MRI essentially looks normal. The lumbar spine mild disc bulges causing radiating pain and numbness in the legs and feet described in detail as below:At L4/L5 level: Mild posterior-central disc bulge is seen indenting the thecal sac and encroaching bilateral neural foramina (right more than left) compressing right exiting nerve roots and abutting left exiting nerve roots. The annular tear is noted at this level. At L5/S1 level: Mild posterior-central disc bulge is seen indenting the thecal sac without any nerve roots compression. So, I consult another ortho specialist and he suggested to do physiotherapy and exercise for 10 days now. I completed 14 days but I did not feel any improvement. Previously two months ago I have taken treatment for erectile dysfunction and the doctor suggests taking medicine for one month, but I took for two weeks and stopped the medicine. I do not know any side effects from the tablets. So please advise me to take proper treatment.","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). According to your complaints, I will suggest you few things. Do not sit in front of the computer for a long time not more than one hour after that at least walk for 2 to 3 minutes and you can get back to your work. Because of long-standing sitting in front of the computer, your shoulder muscles must be weakened. So, to strengthen your muscles you need to start exercises for that. Coming to your disc prolapse. You have symptoms for that if you have weakness in your legs then it requires surgery. Before that, I will prescribe nerve related tablets. Tablet Pregabalin 75 mg daily once after food for one month.

The doctor gave me Doxycycline. Now I checked for HIV. The last test method was HIV 1 and 2 screening test, serum, and HIV 1 and p24 combo. Can I now be relaxed that I am HIV free?","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, the negative results of these test (attachment removed to protect patient identity) on repeat after four months indicates that you are not infected with HIV. Nowadays, fourth generation tests are able to pick up the antibody if you are infected with HIV. HIV if negative after three months, then chances of HIV is very rare, and few guidelines recommend that you repeat it after six months again.

I am 20 years old, height is 5 feet 9 inches and weight is 200 lbs.","Doctor":"Hello. I have read through your question and would like to tell you that you are most likely suffering from stomach flu. Have you eaten anything which may have been contaminated like frozen food? Are you running a fever? If you are only passing watery stools with no foul smell then it is a viral infection and needs symptomatic treatment. You can start taking capsule Bifilac (Lactobacillus) twice daily. Keep yourself hydrated and take tablet Pantop DSR (Domperidone and Pantoprazole) to relieve the vomiting. If you are not able to keep the medicine down then you will have to get admitted and get IV (intravenous) therapy.

I have bloated sore breasts, 10 days late on the menstrual cycle, negative pregnancy test, appendectomy on the 20th.","Doctor":"Hello. Near menses or missed periods can give signs of bloated breasts, the fullness of abdomen, mood variations due to hormones. Have serum beta hCG (blood pregnancy test) to clear the status of pregnancy. If pregnancy test comes negative, you can have menstrual induction by hormones if you want. Some other factors also can delay periods like a strict diet, strenuous exercise, thyroid abnormalities, hormonal imbalance, illness, hormones or medicine intake, anemia, etc. Check these factors as well. If in the coming cycles also you observe irregularity without any reason, then you might need investigations.

I have tried several home remedy but it does not work. Kindly suggest me medicine for removing dark circle.","Doctor":"Hi. I understand having the dark circles under the eyes is very frustrating. Many people, especially women suffer from this problem and mainly it is due to stress and in your case, there is stress on your eyes due to constantly spending time in front of the computer. I have been prescribing several homeopathic remedies in my practice for this problem and have seen very effective results. I would suggest you apply Berberis Aquafolium mother tincture on the dark circle area. You will get this liquid in any homeopathic pharmacy. Just add 10 drops of this liquid in half cup of water, stir it well and apply it to the area. Wash it off after 30 minutes with plain water. Apply this liquid twice a day for 15 days. If possible use screen guard on your computer which will not strain your eyes and thus would help to reduce the dark circles as well. Also, make sure you sleep at least for 7 to 8 hours every day and eat healthy food. Kindly try the above methods and report back in 15 days.

Sorry to hear about your daughter. As you rightly infer, she is having vesicoureteric reflux. Right more affected than left.

Like seeing a different color other than black?","Doctor":"Hi. No, you cannot be color blind to black or shades of grey. Congenital color blindness (patients have it since birth) can be one of three types: Acquired color blindness can be due to a variety of different factors like injuries, drug use, etc. They do not follow any rule like in congenital color blindness and can affect any spectrum of colors.

Now, she has developed water in the lungs. Due to that, there is breathlessness, no appetite, no sleep, water retention in feet, and stomach. The doctor has removed 1 liter of water from the lungs, but second day it is accumulating. What will be the treatment?","Doctor":"Hello. Your sister is undergoing peritoneal (stomach) dialysis. Now, she is having fluid retention in her body. This can be either due to change in her fluid intake habits wherein she has now increased fluid intake, another reason may be that the dialysis technique is not resulting in an adequate water removal from her body as well as poor clearance of toxic material (which may account for her poor appetite). We also have to see if the medicine fluid which we install in her stomach is going into her chest cavity. Having excluded the later condition, I would suggest her to have a PET test which will give an idea of how her stomach surface membrane is working. This will give an idea as to how we can tailor our dialysis schedule for her (number of sessions per day, duration of each session, the concentration of fluid to be used, etc). I hope I have helped you. For more information consult a nephrologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am sharing my bedroom with my father, he is 66 years old. He is in generally good health and has ulcerative colitis. I am just having an issue nowadays where he keeps sneezing and coughing without covering his face all over the room. I assume that it is due to an allergy. He does not like to wear mask and thinks it is funny when he coughs or sneezes around me. Nothing to do with Coronavirus. I just wanted to know your expert opinion if I could get something from him because I feel disgusted when I see him coughing and sneezing around me. Is this cough and sneeze harmlesss? Easily taken care of by our immune system or would I possibly get some illness from him and start coughing and sneezing myself?","Doctor":"Hello. In times of coronavirus, that is the first thing that comes to my mind. Cough and nasal congestion are some of the symptoms of coronavirus sadly. If that is the case, there is a very high likelyhood you can get it from him. However, if you have got him tested and it is negative, it is more likely to be allergic. If so, it is not possible to transfer the disease to you just by being in your proximity. If possible start him on antihistamines and nasal spray as soon as possible to relieve him of his symptoms. I will give you a prescription for the same. Tablet Levocetirizine every night 1/2 hour before sleeping, Flomist Nasal Spray twice daily in both nostrils, Diluted Povidone Iodine gargles 3 times daily, Syrup Macbery cough syrup 5 mL twice a day.

The doctor does not want to fix the perforated ear until the tube falls out of the left ear and is healthy for a year. In the meantime, it is suggested that a hearing aid be used until the perforation surgery. Does this sound like a normal course of action and will ear perforation surgery improve the situation?","Doctor":"Hello. We shall do the ear perforation surgery only when we are sure that eustachian tube ventilation to the middle ear is normal and not hampered by any reason. The functioning of the eustachian tube is indicated by the successful falling off of the ventilation tube (the grommet). The falling off indicates that middle ear pressures are getting maintained by the natural eustachian tube. Usually, kids of this age have some remnant adenoids which causes tubal obstruction causing recurrent ear issues (like in your kid). Usually, the adenoids regress by this age. If they don't, then the kid will have symptoms of mouth breathing, snoring, teeth crowding and protrusion, and other signs of adenoid facies. If these issues are there then before we attempt ear surgery we will have to remove the adenoids (and +/- tonsils). Because the source of ear infection is adenoids (+/- tonsils). Otherwise we can wait for a while until the natural eustachian tubes function well and then we can repair the eardrum. We would need to do an adenoid x-ray to check for the adenoid size. Meanwhile, hearing aid is the best option because you cannot risk your child not hearing properly at this age as it would adversely affect his speech and development. For any queries on this matter please revert back to me."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I got my two teeth removed and both of them from the bottom. One from front bottom teeth, and one from the back of bottom right canine. My orthodontist now uses rubber bands on my teeth which I have been wearing for almost two weeks now but I can see my canines have adjusted but my front teeth are flaring outside and it is looking so ugly that I am worried they might never go back in due to lack of space. I hope you can suggest me something here. Looking forward to your reply. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. From the history and picture of the side of teeth (attachment removed to protect patient identity), I can tell you that your upper and lower teeth are flared. Also, there is an increased gap (overjet) between your upper and lower teeth. As you said, only your lower teeth were removed, that could be the reason for the overjet and hence the elastics (presumably). Use of elastics in a Class II fashion, that is upper front to lower back teeth can further increase the flaring of your lower teeth but will reduce the flaring of upper teeth and reduce overjet. Reducing the overjet is quite important and due to your bone structure (smaller lower jaw), flaring of teeth is bound to happen. So, I will suggest discussing other options like removing upper teeth as well or if required a surgical alternative to enable and bring the lower teeth to a less flared position. If however, that is not an acceptable option for you, slightly flared lower teeth would be the result and quite acceptable in our case.

Last Sunday, I went to a different clinic for tooth filling because my dentist went abroad for vacation. In fact, it lessened the pain but afterward, it became more painful. So I contacted my dentist for medicine to take and he prescribed me to drink Clindamycin and Dolfenal. And until today, after the effectivity of the medicine, I cannot bear the pain. I am planning to remove it, but the dentist of my friend did not recommend it because it might have an abscess on it, while my dentist said that it is alright to remove. And because of that I am confused which one I should follow. I hope you can respond to this so that I can decide to remove it or not.","Doctor":"Hi. Firstly, I would like to say that a simple filling cannot be a treatment for a tooth in pain. The pain itself occurs only because of infection inside the tooth. Yes, as the other dentist said, it could be a dental abscess. You have also mentioned that you have severe pain which means definitely there is an infection underneath. I suggest you crush one tablet of Ketorol DT (Ketorolac) 10 mg in half a glass of water and drink it for effective pain relief. Plus, you can take the same in tablet form thrice daily after food for three days. This is just a pain killer. Regarding the removal of that tooth, the choice is completely yours. It is alright to get it removed as you think and then you shall go for any of the replacement options later on. If not removed, then the treatment plan would be a root canal therapy depending on how much tooth structure is left behind.

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

But over a period of time, we have been fighting over issues. Although we still love each other a lot, in the midst of arguments he gets angry and hits my head. I, in turn, hit him. In fact pretty harder than he does and this continues. I have tried controlling my reaction many times but eventually, I was losing respect for him and losing self-respect too. So, every time he hits me now, I hit him back too. And it happens as a reflex. Most of these issues happen while we are in the car. So every time he hits me using his right hand on the left side of my head. I already have sensitivity on that side of the head close to the ear. And I do not know the reason for this pain.The last time it happened five days back and my head is hurting since then. The left side, a few inches above the ear. Is there anything I should be worried about?Also, I was expecting my period in two to three days. My usual period starts with spotting and after two days of spotting the flow increases. But post this incident my period came the very next day. I saw a lot of blood right at the start which has never happened in the last 16 years. I have PCOS and a fibroid near my right ovary. I am also trying to get pregnant. My mother is a gynecologist. I told her I have hurt my head somewhere and so it hurts. She did not take it seriously because of the way I said and she does not want me to be exposed to radiations by taking CT or MRI scans for a normal pain. I cannot tell her that this has been happening for a couple of times. My husband really loves me but then he gets angry and does this sometimes and regrets later. He has never looked down on me or hurt me otherwise. But he gets angry easily for the silliest stuff. I do not see any swelling in my head but it is highly sensitive to touch and pains a lot.

One week back, my HbA1c result was 6.7 and my fasting 105 and PP (without tablet) was 180. I consulted a doctor. She told me to take Insulin 10 units two times a day. She said this is better than taking tablets. Please suggest what to do.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand you are hesitant to use Insulin. But what she has said is right. Finally, Insulin is what controls your blood sugars. Since people are hesitant to use it, we usually do not prescribe it as a first-line treatment. Oral medications help the pancreas to produce insulin. So in case, your cells are not producing any insulin at all, they would not be useful. Also, in the future, you would require using Insulin once your cells are exhausted of insulin. Your body is still responding to medicines. So, if you want, you can tell her that you would like to use oral medications and see how your sugar levels turn up. Or else, you can give Insulin a try and see. Regards.

According to your condition, along with Ayurvedic medicines you also require panchakarma procedures like Vamana or Virechana. Vaman is emesis therapy and Virechana is purgation therapy.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Normal complete healing of an extracted tooth socket will definitely take up to two weeks. As you have asked, the rawness and dull pain would be there in the first week. Also, dry socket can occur within the first three days of extraction and not anytime later. It happens only if the blood clot after extraction is continuously interrupted through smoking habits or even a vigorous gargling or brushing.

During college days also no issues were there as such. But while joined in a metro city as my first job felt bit awkward that I was not able to mingle with all people in my colony. I used to avoid social activity a bit. After that posted in a remote area where stayed for five years and enjoyed a lot mixing and partying with all sort of people. Then I was posted to my home place where one influential boss wanted to keep me in his section but due topressure from higher up he had to give up his idea, but directly or indirectly he was harsh. That was the beginning I feel. Along with that during that posting, I used to travel a lot, worked almost day and night just for my good name, that people will appreciate. Got lots of appreciation but these process initiate. During initial days after few hours of conversation people used to know about my eye ogling issue but now I feel within few minutes they can make out. Please help. I want to change it at any cost. Sometimes doing exercise, yoga but not so regular. My sleeping is very good, after going to bed, within a few seconds I used to sleep.

During any farewell or any party if any photography will be there then my face will be in very much in tension. So nowadays during the photography session, I am avoiding that and instead, take photographs of all. Slowly and steadily I want to change eye ogling issue. My eye ogling look is like someone is surprised to see something strange. I know I can change but an efficient or proper support is needed. Never taken any medication. For blood pressure taken Repace 25 initially two years back. From mid of last year taken Repace 50. And later started taking CTD T 6.25/40.

You are mostly disturbed about a preoccupation with eye ogling. And you have had panic related to normal bodily symptoms like stomach ache, headache, and hand pain. I think you are having anxiety issues. Consulting a psychiatrist would be my advice. I would suggest taking tablet Nexito 5 mg once a day after breakfast. It starts to have an effect on anxiety and social avoidance after at least 15 days of taking it. There are no side effects in the long term but in the initial two weeks, you may experience gastric trouble or bloat and initially increased anxiety.

Since I was a college student, each month for all the four days of my period, I had to stay home lying in the fetal position, had to keep a heating pad on my lower abdomen and used to take some serious pills. I have seen so many doctors, and each one of them gave me the diagnosis of endometriosis. After I had done a deep search about this medical condition, I was not happy at all. I even tried contraceptive pills for six month, which reduced my pain but made me gain 9 kg due to pure water retention. So, I stopped the pills, and the pain returned more aggressively. Since I start working as a nurse, I am having problems to keep up with the working time during my periods. And my colleagues cannot always help me out to switch working days with me. So, I had a laparoscopy, and they found inflammatory things, but they could not determine what exactly it is. So, I changed my doctor and did an RMI, according to it they found some endometriosis tissues. And I also have a retroverted uterus. I am tired and sick of this issue, and lately, I started taking medicines to help me endure my pain. According to the latest doctor that I consulted, I have only two options, a medication called Visanne or an injection called Decapeptyl.

And yes, endometriosis causes very painful periods, and the only way to stop this pain is to stop your periods, which can be done through pills, injections or surgery. Surgery is not the answer for you, as you have already had one. And chances of recurrence are high post surgery unless we remove the uterus and ovaries too. But, we cannot do that at your age.

Fatty liver (NASH or Non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis). 4. Alcoholic hepatitis. 5. Auto-immune hepatitis, etc. I will recommend that you see a hepatologist or medical gastroenterologist. The initial steps to be taken are as follows: 1. Repeat blood tests for LFTs (liver function tests) in a standard laboratory. 2. Ultrasound abdomen.  If the blood tests LFTs are still abnormal, a further blood test to evaluate the cause for this will include: 1. Hepatitis A IgM to check for hepatitis A infection. 2. HBsAg, HBcAg (IgM) for hepatitis B infection. 3. HCV Antibodies to check for hepatitis C infection. 4. Liver autoantibodies (ANA anti-nuclear antibody, ASMA anti-smooth muscle antibody, AMA anti-mitochondrial antibody), etc. Based on the above results, further evaluation may be required like a liver fibroscan or a liver biopsy. 1. Viral hepatitis. 2. Drug induced hepatitis. Make a note of all the medicines you could have taken in the last few months including allopathic drugs, eg., statins (cholesterol medication), painkillers (Paracetamol, NSAIDs- non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), herbal remedies or any other supplements. Discuss this with your doctor or write back to me if you have any further queries.

All was normal but my D-dimer was 1.28 ug/ml (normal below 0.50). Chest CT with contrast normal, doppler u/s both legs normal, abdomen/pelvic CT, as well as abdominal ultrasound normal. The doctor says do not worry about D-dimer but it was normal range a year ago. I had a hysterectomy, endometriosis excision or fallopian tubes removed five months ago and it resulted in an abscess and sepsis. I was hospitalized for a week but recovered. I have Hashimoto's but no treatment because my TSH is in a normal range. Should I continue to pursue the D-dimer? Currently, I am taking Lexapro 10 mg daily.","Doctor":"Hello. I think we should retest D-dimer may be after few weeks, three to four weeks. This is to see the trend and confirm the elevated levels. The usual causes for elevation include DVT (deep vein thrombosis), pulmonary embolism, infection, stroke, trauma and rarely some cancerous conditions. Also, D-dimer rises with age. But, all your investigations are negative so ruling out the major and important causes for elevated D-dimer.  I guess at this moment, you are totally asymptomatic, right? No fever or any evidence of infection, etc. The elevation from previous infection five months back should have settled by this time. You have undergone all possible test to rule out the causes for elevated D-dimer so I think there is no need to worry about it at this moment. So overall, I think, we should repeat the test after three to four weeks. Also, see if you have any symptoms or let me know if suffered from recent infection or trauma.

In last four or five CBC in two months, it has never crossed the 7 to 9 range. Also, sending you CT and USG reports of two years back.","Doctor":"Hello. I saw your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your concern for high TLC (total leukocyte count) is not bothering me. We do see DLC (differential count) also, which tells the character of cells whether they are cancerous or not). There is nothing like that in your report. So, you need not worry. HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) report is normal, means at present we do not have anything conclusive as almost all investigations have been done in your case except for your bone marrow examination. As you are completely fine and symptom-free and your JAK test was also negative, you are most likely NOT suffering from any cancer, etc. Hematocrit/PCV if crosses 55 to 60, then only we give some symptomatic drug. From my side, I would advise you to just follow dietary advice and get blood levels checked only after three months. Getting it checked every month will only make you more stressed, which I certainly do not want. For more information consult a hematologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am 23 years old. I am suffering from a generalized anxiety disorder since childhood. One of the reasons for it is a physical defect I have, which makes me self-conscious. I got to know very early that something is wrong with me. I have consulted many psychiatrists and tried many medicines. Nothing helps except sleeping. I am now addicted to masturbation. I am unable to concentrate on anything I do. I have consistent negative thoughts. I have low self-esteem. Recently, I completed an MBA and did not get placed due to my issues. I need to build my career soon. It is getting worse. I am losing interest in life.","Doctor":"Hello. A lot of individuals have generalized anxiety disorder and this often causes significant comorbidity and depression. What kind of physical defect do you have? Regarding masturbation, it is a safe and healthy habit. It does not affect physical, mental or reproductive health. So, do not worry. Do take treatment for generalized anxiety and depression. SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) drugs like Fluoxetine or Escitalopram can be used for treatment. Both are activating and will not cause sleepiness or drowsiness. These drugs are non-addictive and safe to use. For episodes of severe anxiety, Propranolol can be used. So please consult a psychiatrist for evaluation and treatment. With regular treatment in optimum doses, you will be alright. Take care.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

To stop nosebleeds pinch the nose for three minutes gently so that it gets occluded. Apply ice packs in either side of nose while keeping your nose pinched. Elevate head end of bed in night while sleeping. Check your vitals and BP (blood pressure) should not be high. To prevent this apply some lubricant cream inside the nose to keep it moist. Keep some steamer inside the room to produce enough moisture inside the room.

She was advised to take bath with drops of Dettol/Savlon in it. Right now, most blisters dried up and some more growing (current count is 8). The issue is, she needs to take her vaccine (varicella vaccine) on the 7th. It seems like the doctor is keen to give it as well. There are some other vaccines as well to be given normally at 15 months. I just need to double check, is it safe to go for the vaccine now?

If it is molluscum, nothing to be worried about but if it is chicken pox, you need to start Acyclovir therapy for faster relief. Are the blisters causing some marks after they fade? Please discuss with your pediatrician about the probability of chicken pox. You can delay the scheduled vaccine for another week till she is free from this viral infection because the immune system is altered and the vaccine may flare up the infection. I suggest you hold the vaccine for a week or two. If it is surely molluscum, the treatment what you are getting is appropriate as it goes on its own. No other tests or treatment required. Only thing is that you need to maintain good personal hygiene. No need to be tensed just relax, she will be alright.

Bell Clapper deformity is congenital (since birth) but may have been noticed only now. In this, the testis is suspended at an abnormal angle and is more prone to torsion. The muscle around the testicles is oriented in an oblique manner and so when it contracts during exertion, it twists the testis.

A majority of the pain is the inside of my knee and I am unable to sit for more than five minutes. There is almost a heaviness inside my knee as if there is a ball stuck there.

I have struggled with something I thought was depression for a long time but it was always more like episodes of suicidal thoughts and me being in a deep depression. Like if I do have it the other night I had one that lasted four hours and last year I had one that lasted three months but I did not tell anyone. I would like to do something about it now or know what I actually have. By the way, the episodes are completely random but there have been a few times when there is a trigger. I also want to be on medication because I have tried everything else as nothing works.","Doctor":"Hello. What are your symptoms exactly? If they are of depression, then the treatment with an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) is ideally given for six months or so. Basically, if you are depressed, you will feel irritable, low, feel like crying, sad, do not wish to eat, have difficulty sleep, there can be anxiety, tiredness, headaches, etc. In bipolar illness, there will be a period of these depressive symptoms and then after a period of normalcy, the reverse happens. That is you feel unusually happy for no reason, there are episodes of spending money excessively on things which you do not need, or maybe excessive use of alcohol, other illicit drugs, sex, irritable behavior, decreased need for sleep and still feeling fresh, grandiose talks and ideas, many non-goal directed activities, etc. So if you have not had the manic and hypomanic phase, then you probably suffered from major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder. So if you are just depressive then SSRIs are to be used and if you are bipolar then a mood stabilizer will be added to the prescription."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am a 37-year-old female.

I do not have knowledge about patient's past medical history, recent health issues other than the heart, status of kidneys, liver, and lungs.

I would recommend to regularly check the patient's blood pressure, blood sugar levels and other routine blood work. Consult back to his cardiologist in a couple of weeks.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

I am not sure what to make out of it. I need help.","Doctor":"Hello. How are you doing? Ferpill is Clomifene citrate which increases the ovulation chances. So thereby, improving the chances of the egg meeting sperms. You can wait for a max of seven to 10 days. One of the side effects of this pill is that it may slightly reduce the thickness of endometrial lining in some. So, the next period may be late or lesser. If you do not get periods even after 10 days, then have a home urine pregnancy test. If still negative, have tablet Novelon or Ovral-G or Dear 21 or Duoluton-L or Intimacy plus 3 one tablet twice a day for 10 days. Throw away the 21st pill. No matter what the cause, you will get periods within seven to 10 days. Next time when you take pills of Clomifene citrate, have tablet Progynova (Estradiol) 2 mg once daily from day-7 of periods for the days. This will counter this side effect. Only if there is a good thickness, can an embryo get a grip into the uterus. One more reason for altered periods, could be your low weight. Your expected body weight is 52 to 57 kg. So, this pill could have tilted the balance of hormones. Do have some nutritious food and improve your health and weight a bit. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more queries.

You have a good sperm count with good progressive motility. Generally, sperm count less than 20 million is an indicative of infertility. You can join a gym and can do exercise. On the contrary, it is better and will benefit to improve your fertility chances. Varicocele does cause infertility as accumulated blood in testes increases temperature in the testes that is detrimental for sperm production. My advice for you is use tight underwear so that testis should not hang down. Also, use loose clothes that will maintain air circulation around the testes and hence will decrease the temperature of the testes. Do not work in hot environments and do regular checkups of sperm count.

Since being on Clonazepam, I developed mild anxiety and my myoclonus continued to worsen. Now, I have violent full body jerks that cause me to fall over backwards every day. I am now on 1 mg Clonazepam in the morning and evening. After six months of Clonazepam and just after increasing my dose to 0.5 mg twice a day, I developed pressure of speech and the longer I have been on the drug the worse my myoclonus and anxiety has become. I am now in a vicious circle as the myoclonus episodes are so violent and I fall backwards heavily despite whatever I hold onto. I have become anxious at having an episode and the actual anxiety can trigger a myoclonus episode, although it also occurs when I feel safe such as sitting down, reading a book or chatting with friends. Six weeks ago, I was told to double the dose due to the high number of falls I was having during myoclonus episodes and since then I have developed mini-seizures and worsening of anxiety. My neurologist is referring me to a psychiatrist for CBT for anxiety and now believes anxiety is the likely cause of my myoclonus. I am happy to do this as I just want to overcome my fear of falling. My dystonia also is causing me to fall due to motor control problems with my legs. The behavior of my legs is very unpredictable, so without warning I regularly trip or my legs suddenly buckle, especially when tired or if I am on my feet for too long. Every drug I have been on since been diagnosed with dystonia has caused serious side effects, even at a low dose and I was told by one of the neurologists that my brain is very sensitive to the side effects of the drugs. The anxiety has only developed since being on the Clonazepam and seems to have worsened whenever the dose has been increased. Could Clonazepam cause anxiety? I have now lost my confidence to leave the house, even with my walker as during a myoclonus episode it is so vigorous the walker just tips over with me and I have episodes every day, but just do not know when one may occur. I have not walked as far as the end of my road about 100 meters for nearly five months now and even with friends still feel apprehensive when walking even a short distance with them. I have lost my confidence to stand in the kitchen to do chores in case I have an episode. I often crawl around on the floor, especially when tired as tiredness definitely increases the episodes and the higher dosage of Clonazepam makes me feel very tired by midday. I am also under stress at home as I am a carer of my 86 year old father who has Alzheimer's, although I get some support from social services with carers, who come in to get him up and his breakfast and then his evening meal. I am normally a very positive person, but right now I wonder if I will ever get better. I am keen to start CBT. But, I am still concerned that Clonazepam initiated the anxiety as a side effect and so would need to withdraw from the Clonazepam in order to recover properly. All I know for certain is I never had myoclonus before my DBS surgery. I never had anxiety or a single fall. Right now, I wish I never had DBS as it done little to help me physically and my quality of life right now is far worse. I am finding it hard to stay positive and feel very discouraged. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. We are here to help you. Reading your complete details I understand your concern and pain. First of all I would say that Clonazepam does not increase anxiety. You might be having myoclonus following DBS as it is a known adverse effect of DBS (deep brain stimulation). Following DBS, there are people who have worsened symptoms. However, myoclonus and frequent fall could be a feature of your Parkinson's only and that has appeared now and you might be linking it to DBS.

I have been clear of the injection since about seven months. Now, my partner and I are trying to conceive. I had a semen analysis and the results were not great. The worst part is the morphology. Only 2 % of my sperms are formed normally. The rest are abnormal. So my two questions are: is it possible that the chlamydia is the cause of this? Can chlamydia cause permanent problems for male fertility? Is there anything I can do to increase this percentage? I am taking vitamins and exercising. I am soon going to cut out sugars and watch my diet. Will this help? Are there other things we can do? Lastly, the evaluation said I have a 'poor prognosis' in terms of my morphology. And overall it said I have 'moderate male factor' circled on my sheet (I assume that means - moderate male factor infertility?). But the person who did the analysis said I am suitable for IUI's. How successful are these in my circumstance? I will attach a photo of the evaluation so you can see all my numbers. I have only blocked out personal information. Sorry for all the background. Again three questions: Did chlamydia play a role in my current situation? Anything I can do to improve my normal morphology? How successful is IUI in my circumstance after looking at my evaluation?","Doctor":"Hello. Chlamydia is one of the major reasons for this situation along with other factors like smoking, and alcohol. Complete the course of antibiotics given by your doctor to improve your semen. Also quit smoking, and alcohol consumption if you are taking.

Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

However, we understand that without surgery there is a high recurrence rate which we are concerned about. We have been told the two treatment options are A) Securing the bowel to the mesentery. B) Removing the short section of the bowel that is prone to twisting. My questions are if a short section of bowel is removed is a colostomy bag always fitted, or can it be done without one? When a colostomy is later reversed and the two sections of the colon are connected back together, does not this present the same problem of feces passing through a section of the bowel which has been operated on before it has had time to heal? So, what is the point of fitting the colostomy bag in the first place?","Doctor":"Hello. The treatment of sigmoid volvulus depends on the general health of the patient and the nature of presentation. In an elderly patient, with multiple comorbid illnesses or who are unfit for anesthesia, the preferred modality is endoscopic (colonoscopic). The recurrence rate of this has to be accepted. If the patient is fit for surgery, it can be either suture fixed or resected (The redundant segment). In an unstable patient, especially in an emergency, the chances of healing will be less. Then a stoma is opted for temporary diversion, in order to facilitate a safe anastomosis of intestine later. In relatively stable patient, an upfront primary joining of intestine ends can be done. The proper healing of the same will allow smooth passage of contents. A stoma is not always needed. It is used only when a primary anastomosis is unsafe. The present scenario: endoscopy is the safest option considering age and comorbid. Avoid constipation at any cost, as it predisposes to volvulus. Hope your queries have been cleared.

He can watch TV, videos with no problem. Yesterday he was playing virtual games with his sister, the game with bowling, tennis, baseball, and boxing. He was boxing and had another episode. It is after the episode that varies. When it started, he either vomited or fell asleep. Now that it has been several months, yesterday's was not so bad, no vomiting, he did not sleep. However, later that night when he was in his bed with no other distractions, he would kick his legs and move quickly, it felt like a residual episode. I am not sure how to explain it. We have treated him with Dramamine and an antihistamine through the doctor. He has had a brain scan which was negative. A full blood panel. All the numbers were nominal. We know what triggers it.

I will be getting six sessions over the next six months. I want to complement this treatment with a healthy skin care regime. I read that aloe vera gel and certain essential oils such as carrot seed and lavender essential oil aid in skin regeneration. My question is can I apply these oils (diluted in grapeseed oil) or aloe vera gel as an overnight lotion? Will it clash with whatever process the viva treatment has initiated within my skin? I do not like the night cream offered by my cosmetologist as it appears a little too emollient and does not smell that good. Also, I would rather use something natural.","Doctor":"Hello. I have noted your concern. A resurfacing treatment would leave your skin red and sensitive for a few days till the epidermis regenerates fully. So, you should be judicious in using products which supposedly while aiding skin regeneration are in fact, irritating or comedogenic. I am against using essential oils on the face, particularly because they usually do not suit sensitive skin and being an oil they can flare up acne which I am sure would be the last thing in the world you would be expecting, considering that you are taking these sessions to improve the appearance of your acne scars. Aloe vera gel is a good option and you can definitely use it post resurfacing sessions. Make sure you use a good brand and not raw aloe vera extracted directly from the leaves.

First of all, we need to understand that this not something which is is unusual. We all come across with past experiences and associate with them on certain occasions. If those past experiences were pleasurable one that there is innate wish to re-experience them and same is applicable for you. It can be said that this is normal to have fantasy to love and loved by someone who was very close to you. However, we need to keep track of society and changes that took place over the last four years. Since she is married it will be completely wrong for her to get associated with you in any romantic relationship. Since you love her, there is a good chance you will not push her in trouble. In case you push her in some different way that too create problems for her as well as you. At this stage it is important to do following.  1. Minimise the interaction with her through common friends and relatives. If possible avoid meeting her completely.  2. Engage yourself with productive work. Do not allow your brain to wander here and there.  3. Get married or in relationship if still single. This is most important part as other romantic relationship will distract you to the core needs of life and will also allow you to understand her situation.  4. Acknowledge that this is common emotion and you will try your level best to overcome it.  5.

According to your statement, you are 19 years old sexually active person suffering from discharging of yellowish colored semen, itching of penis and feeling of discomfort during urination and all your symptoms indicates STD (sexually transmitted disease). Your STD is either chlamydia which is caused by chlamydia trachomatis, most common or gonorrhea which is caused by N.gonorrhea or both. Both diseases present similar clinical symptoms and treatment is almost the same. Single dose of Azithromycin is the treatment of choice. By collecting urethral swab, it can be specified either chlamydia or gonorrhea. In gonorrhea, urethral swab shows the presence of gram-negative diplococci and in the case of chlamydia, swab shows non-specific urethritis. Urine for C/S can also be done. After undergoing the investigations, please inform me about the results."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am an unmarried 35-year-old male. It all started last month when I experienced mid-epigastric pain one fine morning. I took some pain relievers and got rid of that. Then, after almost a week, I got lower back pain on the right side suddenly one morning, then, upper back pain middle to the right side next day afternoon, below the right shoulder blade, which is persistent till date. I did many ultrasounds and X-rays and several blood tests. The ultrasound always said grade-1 (mild fatty liver). I got CT and MRCP first done two years ago and again last year. I then got MRCP done again thrice in the last year. Every time I am seeing the tests as 'normal'. I experienced a bit of testicular atrophy and muscle atrophy and weight loss (I went down to 70 kg from 78 kg) and less appetite. Then, I saw my abdomen protruding a bit. I gained some weight in between. (now 80 kg). Asymptomatic urination - sometimes normal urination, sometimes no urine for three to four hours. Last year, there was a small underarm swelling on my right underarm which still persists and it is painful if I press it hard. I got severe viral infections a month and two later and lost a little weight. Now, I have been experiencing severe back pain on my back, mostly on my middle to right side. Appetite is also very little. I have undergone several blood tests, CT, MRCP, lumbar-pelvic MRI, ultrasound, X-rays, etc, in these two years and did not get any specific diagnosis. I am not sure whether it is my liver, spine, bone marrow, lymph nodes, pancreas, gallbladder, or stomach that is causing this trouble. Early this year, I underwent upper GI endoscopy for my poor appetite, and the doctor discovered a small ulcer in my pyloric channel (caused by H.pylori). I was put on the triple therapy for the same, still no positive outcome. My liver enzymes (SGPT and SGOT are mildly elevated). This back pain and loss of appetite are killing me almost every day. I fear some kind of malignancy as my mother succumbed to gallbladder cancer and associated complications two years ago. The pain I am experiencing is as if something is pressing on my right side back, below the shoulder blade (referred pain). I am left out with more invasive procedures such as endoscopic ultrasound, liver biopsy, PET CT, FNAC, bone marrow biopsy, HIDA scan etc. My ESR and LDH are slightly elevated for almost a year. My sugar is under control. My lipid profile is a little bit abnormal, H. pylori IgG negative, vitamin D insufficient, testosterone is below the normal range, and kidney profile is normal.","Doctor":"Hello.

It is extremely debilitating and treatment resistant. The onset was after car accidents, stress and substance abuse at age from 19 to 21. I am no longer smoke or drink and have stopped before 10 years. I have seen the top neurologists in my country, taken all the drugs and Botox variants and even considered deep brain stimulation. All scans and blood tests have come back with nothing. I also have vague symptoms that my neurologists dismissed out of hand or had no clue about and said as much. The first symptom is a discoloration of the skin from the base of my skull, which runs halfway down my back. It is a pale yellow brown hue, more noticeable in natural light. Aside from my neck spasms, this is the only visual, physical symptom I have, apart from persistent acne on the back.The second symptom I have, which happens once or twice in a year, although less frequently in the last few years, is a feeling at night. It feels like I am going to experience some kind of organ failure in my middle back. This is coupled with breaking out in a cold sweat. I can only describe it as feeling like I am on the verge of dying. It is not a pleasant sensation. I also experience depression and anxiety and an odd lack of pain in most of my body. This lack of pain numbs the excruciating spasms in my neck, but also hinders healing and sensations throughout my body. With all this in mind, my question is, are there any tests the neurologists might have missed that an endocrinologist would usually employ? Does my symptoms sound worthy of further investigation by an endocrinologist?","Doctor":"Hi.

The doctors said that my gastric motility is a bit under-par. To rule out any physical damage, I went through colonoscopy three years ago. The reports only mentioned small hemorrhoids. I was on a brief course of antacids and laxatives after that, which gave me temporary relief. Constipation had reduced considerably by the end of last year. However, I have been experiencing acid reflux since early this year. This is the first time that I have had regular episodes of reflux. So, I did my endoscopy four months back. It revealed ulcers in the esophagus near the sphincter (GERD). It also revealed a small sliding hiatus hernia. No metaplasia seen in biopsy. The doctors said that since I am a young patient, surgery is not recommended. They said I have to rely on lifestyle modifications and antacids. Currently, I am taking Nexpro RD 20 mg capsules and Riflux Forte syrup. I have cut down on spicy food, and also have altered my meal times since the past one and a half months. The acid reflux has reduced by 60 to 70 % since the lifestyle change. However, I still experience some really disturbing symptoms: stinging chest pain at both the breast bones (especially after meals), occasional back-ache, frequent shortness of breath after meals, huge bouts of burping (with the feeling that air is trapped around the diaphragm), and overall fatigue. Regarding chest pain, I have undergone ECG, 2D echo, stress test, and troponin. All tests normal. The cardiologist has ruled out any cardiac problem. However, he has prescribed 2.5 mg of Nebicard SM to control my palpitations. He has already tapered the dose from 5 mg to 2.5 mg, I believe he will take me off the medicine soon. I need help to know what can I do to improve my symptoms.","Doctor":"Hello. Your treatment till date is on the right track and I appreciate your adherence to the same.

Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco).

As you mentioned in the treatment history, he has been diagnosed with bipolar illness type 1, with a few episodes having psychotic features. Let me tell you, it is really concerning if you have been sexually or physically involved with this Mr.X. as the patients with BPAD (bipolar affective disorder) tend to involve in indiscriminate sexual activity, hypersexuality being one of the cardinal symptoms. Along with this, indulging in activities which can be self-harming like gambling, spending excess money, using credit cards without judgment, lending money to people, etc. can be seen. Lying as you mentioned can be a part of his premorbid personality. He needs to take medicines regularly as it is a bipolar illness meaning he can have two poles (extremes) - one is the excited phase (mania) and another the low phase or sad phase (depression). He needs to be put on a mood stabilizer and an active phase treatment. He also requires social support to monitor his meds. Please get yourself tested for STDs (sexually transmitted diseases). Let me know if I can help you again. Take care. For more information consult a psychiatrist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 33 years old. For the past six months I am suffering from primary infertility, PCOS and diagnostic laparoscopy tubal block at right isthmus. Also, laboratory tests like Mantoux (positive), HBsAg (positive), ANA (positive) and LFT raised tests are done. The IUI done twice and my current medication is Metformin and Folic acid. Please suggest me.","Doctor":"Hello. Tubal blockage or fallopian tube obstruction is a major cause of female infertility. Blocked fallopian tubes will not let a sperm and ovum to unite thus interfering with fertilization. The primary and the very first step for pregnancy is the formation of zygote followed by embryo and its implantation. This step is interrupted in tubal blockage. I suggest you that if both the tubes are blocked, then there is no point in going for intrauterine insemination (IUI) and you need to go for IVF -in vitro fertilization. Before that I suggest you that you need to go for hormonal profile, D2 or D3 luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol, prolactin, AMH (anti-mullerian hormones) and thyroid profile. After this IVF can be commenced like oocyte retrieval, spermicide collection, in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer are the steps. You need not worry about being HBsAg positive as a transfer to the baby can be prevented by giving Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination as per recommendation soon after the delivery. Your LFTs (liver function test) are raised and that is of concern as this may be a marker of acute viral hepatitis. I suggest you to go for HBeAg, HBV DNA and anti HBcAg-hepatitis B core antigen to know the viral replication. Being ANA (antinuclear antibody test) positive may lead to pregnancy difficulties like miscarriages due to immune rejection. This may need immunosuppressive therapy with steroids and progesterone supposition.

We are living in an apartment and she accuses of me of being a cheater. She has no reasoning other than that I am communicating with people upstairs through the walls. There are men and women living upstairs and when you hear them walking or make any kind of noise, she says I am a cheater. When I type or click anything or cough or clear my throat or even breathe, she thinks that is a way of me communicating with women upstairs. They cannot even hear me. Also, she will not let me be around my family or let them over. I never cheated and when I asked her why she thinks so, she says because I communicate with women upstairs by breathing, clicking a mouse or typing. When this happens, she punches me, bites me, squeezes my nose, throws books hard at the ceiling at walls and breaks my belongings. Also, I have several cuts and bruises because of this. I cannot hang out with friends or go anywhere without her. She also calls me horrible names when I pay for everything and sweet to her. I feel so depressed and saddened. She screams extremely loud when she accuses me of cheating when I am with her all the time. I do not know what is going on here? What kind of treatment does she need? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I read your query and understand your concerns. From the available description, there are two possibilities regarding her illness. Either she was diagnosed wrongly with bipolar disorder as there are no symptoms in description which indicate bipolar disorder. If she truly had mood episode, then probably she is suffering with schizoaffective disorder, which have symptoms of bipolar disorder as well as psychosis.

We used a condom the whole time, but I was worried there could have been a leak and got her an I-pill within 18 hours of intercourse. She has had no bleeding whatsoever since then and not even had her periods yet. Is there anything to worry? She normally gets her periods in 28 days. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. How are you doing? The act of sex was on day-15 of the period, that is, very close to the ovulation date. But as you said that a condom had been used all the time and you only have a doubt of spill, the chances of a pregnancy is very very low. As the pill was taken within 24 hours of sex, its success is also very high.  This pill is a progesterone hormone in a high dose. So, the period would be slightly delayed. Some do get their periods within 10 days of the pill, but I would suggest you wait until seven to 10 days of the expected date. So, wait until the 25th of this month. She should get her periods by then. If still no periods, it is due to the deranged hormonal levels due to the pill. If still doubtful about condom failure, have a home urine pregnancy test. Once confirmed as negative, have tablet Duoluton-L (Ethinylestradiol and Levonorgestrel) or Intimacy plus 3 (Ethinylestradiol and Desogestrel) or Novelon or Ovral-G - one tablet twice a day for 10 days (throw away the 21st pill).

But to come to a conclusion based on fundus photographs alone would be incorrect. One of the most accurate ways to judge progression is field analysis done on Humphrey field analyzer. All the known patients with glaucoma need to get their intraocular pressure (IOP) checked every two weeks and their target IOP is maintained then. The fields should be done yearly at least.

I was in love with a girl very sincerely and deeply and she cheated on me. Being a boy, I cannot cry or breakdown in public or in front of anyone, but in the end, I am a human being. It has been two years, but I cannot recover from it. I have kept myself away from drug abuse completely but I need calmness in my life. I feel depressed and cannot accept the fact that she cheated on me. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, it may be common for all of us to listen to such issues what you are going through, but each one of us can realize the pain only when we personally face such a situation. The fact that the girl cheated on you, does not make you responsible for her betrayal. You as an individual, did all possible things to maintain a pure relationship. So, it is her loss in the end. Also, I usually suggest not to try and stop thoughts about her. People might say 'stop thinking about her'. But, I will not suggest the same. Instead, let us follow a simple technique called 'Time Out'. Whenever you decide, during your day, spend a specific amount of time thinking about your memories with her. But, it has to be timed. Let us say, for 20 minutes. Then, keep a timer and when the alarm rings, stop there. Remember, it is hard to fight yourself, but surely it is not impossible. You will require at least a week, to master this time out technique. Some additional questions: If you answer me, I shall be able to help you out more. Have a great blessed life ahead. Take care.

Yes, you are experiencing panic-related symptoms under anxiety issues. As you have shared of phobia. It requires adequate counseling and brief psychotherapy to deal with anxiety problems. The symptoms you are experiencing are part of panic attack. Feelings and symptoms like palpitations, getting heart attack, difficultly in breathing, digestive concerns, and sleep problems can be a part of heart related problems or anxiety. At first, you must need to get proper assessment identifying the cause of this anxiousness whether it is work related or some personal issue.

In addition, to make yourself relax you can do the following: 1. Deep breathing exercises. 2. Walk for at least 30 minutes per day. 3. Workout if possible to release toxins out of your body. 4. Reduce smoking (if you do). 5. Avoid junk and spicy food, soft drinks. 6. Increase water intake. 7.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

In the past few years, I have been misdiagnosed with bipolar, and my current diagnosis is borderline personality disorder. But, I am not sure whats going on really. I am 100 % confident that I am ASD, as it covers my \\"base personality\\" and all my childhood. But, I still do not know if what I am about to describe fits in with ASD. Perhaps, there is co-morbidity that is not just anxiety n depression? I am not sure whether either of the two psychiatric illnesses, that I have previously been diagnosed with, are quite right either. There is bipolar in my family on my mom's side, that is, manic depression was the diagnosis for my grandma. My uncle and aunt had bipolar disorder. This as well as autism and ADHD diagnosis across the family.So, that is why the doctors initially looked at bipolar, but they changed their minds because I did not fit the hypomania and good mood state. I think I need to start writing things down, so the doctors can get the full picture because I struggle to explain verbally and lots go unmentioned. Or they just do not ask the right questions and go on what they have. So anyway this is how I have been for about four weeks now, which is the longest I have been like for years.I will describe what I have been paying attention to, which is different to my usual most stable self. This happens numerous times a year, but usually just lasts a few days or could just be a day or two for so many hours in that day. I am more anxious about having to cope with kids on my own, and I am not getting out with them like I used to. I cannot cope with any difficulty right now, so I am snapping too easily. My mind is racing. I am more productive and creative, and I am looking forward to hosting a party. I rearrange the furniture again once the kids are in bed. My mind is crazy, and I get agitated. I am more talkative, and my whole body starts to shake when I get interrupted. I get angry quickly. I am playing kids games better, which I used to struggle with.I have to reach certain numbers of followers not out of vanity, but because some numbers look right and others do not. I like the number 750, but I do not like the number 723, so I keep trying to get followers just so the number looks right. I am telling people personal stuff about my thoughts and feelings that I would not usually divulge. I have in-depth conversations with my sister-in-law, who I usually cannot tolerate. I have periods of high sex drive and sexual confidence with my partner. My patience is so very thin that I am hitting myself and silently screaming in frustration behind my kids' backs, as they walk slowly up the stairs or just picking them up and carrying them up in a huff.I am very irritable and easily becoming angry out of nowhere. I have taken up jogging suddenly. I am not anxious about people seeing. I am enjoying jogging because it lets me run away without me running away. I keep feeling like I want to run away. I keep seeing my kids as just some kids and not feeling the connection that they are mine. It feels as if they are not my kids. I feel like sometimes when the anger hits me, I lose touch with reality.I do not want to hurt my kids, but the other day, I grabbed my kid's hand so hard as if I am going to hit her, but I ended up hitting the wall. I am here now because I feel like whatever is going on with me is affecting my kids. I am struggling more lately to keep awareness and control over my rage. I am shouting at them easily or speaking to them in a bitchy tone. The worse thing is that I take weeks to feel guilty of what I did.

A personality disorder can also be there. The differential diagnoses are: What you need is an urgent consult with a psychiatrist for detailed evaluation, so that a diagnosis can be established and treatment can be started accordingly. Medications need to be started. I suggest you get the following tests done: Yes, I know the previous experience was not good, but it does not mean it will be like that always. It is also for the safety of your family. Without treatment, the frequency and severity of episodes can increase.

This is a flu season actually and winter started out of nowhere this time. This kind of sudden change in weather leads to more flu cases than a cold weather that kicks in gradually. People are not acclimatized yet, that is why it is highly suggested to observe all precautionary measure at the workplace where close contact with coworkers is inevitable. Now, as you have got the flu, it can be either due to viral attack or bacterial. Symptoms in both cases overlap but treatment options differ much. We prescribe antibiotics only in case of bacterial infection and to be sure we go for a throat swab test to rule it out. If on physical examination, the primary care physician feels it is more like a bacterial infection of the throat, he/she may start antibiotics like Amoxicillin or Penicillin, and meanwhile send a throat swab for culture to pathology laboratory. As the results are in hand your doctor may call and let you know if this was a true bacterial infection or not. Medications are adjusted accordingly. You are taking DayQuil (Acetaminophen, Dextromethorphan, and Pseudoephedrine) and Excedrin (Aspirin, Paracetamol, and Caffeine), that is alright and good to go. I would recommend you to visit your PCP as soon as possible for proper evaluation as discussed above. Meanwhile, keep taking theses medications to keep the symptoms in check, to some extent. Take proper rest and plenty of fluids along with a balanced and healthy diet. Avoid spices, fried and fast foods, sodas, cigarette and excess alcohol. Keep yourself well hydrated. Hope it helps.

I have had it for quite a while, at least seven or more years, though I cannot remember when it popped up originally which brings me to the next point. I do not know if it got bigger or darker over time as I never really paid much attention to it. I think it is roughly the same size, though. As seen in the bottom picture, it is about 4 mm in diameter. It is very slightly protruding or elevated, but not much. I have heard about this whole ABCDE test to spot malignant moles and based on that, it should be fine. But still, the color is strangely dark. So, I would love to know if it is something I should worry about or just observe in the future or does it look like cancer to you?","Doctor":"Hello.

I have trigeminal neuralgia for which I take Lyrica 75 mg during flareups. I recently had a blood test which indicated low vitamin D (6 ng/ml) for which doctor advised me to take D-rise 60,000 IU/week for eight weeks and then 60,000 IU/month for a year. In my CBC done last week, my ALC and my WBC were high that I had a test again eight days later in which the lymphocyte was increased again by 1000. Apart from this, I have pain in lower abdomen and my body keeps having hot and cold flashes. I also have pain in legs and arms and I do not feel hungry like I used to for the past one month.","Doctor":"Hello. Your increased WBC and lymphocytes, I could certainly relate it to your trigeminal neuralgia as this is an inflammation of a nerve which would rise WBC levels even if you are in recovery period with no symptoms. But, what I am concerned about is your appetite and abdominal pain and hot and cold flashes as these symptoms correlate with endocrinal dysfunction. So, we can be certain by doing thyroid function tests to see how it is going.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

After my third time my hair became really dry and curly also there is a lot of hair fall while shampooing.Please let me know whether i can make my hair better","Doctor":"hi, hairs are basically dead keratins only the hair follicle inside the scalp skin from which hair grows is living. so when you straighten them or when you bleach or when you do any styling over them some part of the is always damaged. so that cannot be repaired by the hair itself only the new hair which will grow from the follicle below will be normal. so as you have said you have straightened them three times so you can imagine they are quite damaged. they will break there will have split ends and there will be lusterless without any good conditioner. so if your otherwise hair growth has been normal you have no other option but to just wait for the new hairs to grow and replace the existing damaged ones.. to increase hair growth you can use minoxidil 5% twice daily over the scalp tablet calcium pantothenate + biotin for 4 weeks. both minoxidil and Calcium pantothenate increase hair growth and hair are thick also. I hope this help. thank you"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 23 year old male, a third-year medical student. For the past seven days, I have had an increased urgency and frequency to urinate. I can go even more than 30 times a day - majority of these times, I feel an increased urgency. However, when I go, only a small amount or drops come out. For the past two to three days, the urgency kind of feels to be getting worse, I feel as if I will not be able to hold it. However, I am still able to as there is no leaking. There is no burning or irritation or any discharge. No recent sexual encounters and no other associated symptoms. I take Coveram 10/10 for essential hypertension and Valdoxan 25 because I also do suffer from anxiety. I have been under stress lately as I was doing my exams this past week and finished today. I have done a few tests at my family doctor: Last week I did a dipstick which was normal apart from +1 protein. Voiding bladder US was normal (450 mL pre voiding, 45 mL post voiding). An initial urine culture was normal according to my doctor. Yesterday, I performed another dipstick and urine culture. The dipstick was normal, and early urine microscopy showed 10 to 100 white cell count. We are waiting for the cultures to return. Due to the result of the white cell count, my doctor said it would be worth a try to undergo a 5-day course of antibiotics (Keflex). Today is my third day of antibiotic treatment, symptoms are largely the same. Today, I attempted to hold my bladder. It felt fine in the morning but as the day went on, my symptoms returned and I am finding it harder to hold my bladder. Also, for the first time, I tried going for a run. The entire time I felt a heaviness in my bladder and felt a strong urge to urinate, even though I went before my run began. What do you think could be going on? My doctor believes that it is either a UTI, or most likely, a hypersensitive bladder due to exam stress. However, there have been days where I have not felt stress at all yet symptoms have continued. I am really worried as I want to go back to work in five days and I do not think I will be able to manage the way things are at the moment. My family doctor does think this will settle down now that I have finished exams. Do you think there is a chance it could? I have mentioned this query to another doctor online, and he believed it may be due to an overactive bladder. However, since I am relatively young to receive this diagnosis, I wanted a second opinion, if that is alright. Do you think this could be OAB? I am worried that it could be something serious, like multiple sclerosis. One and a half years ago, I had an episode of sudden onset numbness in one arm and fearing the same thing, I ended up having an MRI of my brain and lumbar spine which both came back negative. Do you think this could be MS?","Doctor":"Hello. Relax and do not worry. As per your symptoms, it looks like overactive bladder only. Do you have any problem with the flow of urine? Or hesitation? Anyhow, as you are taking antibiotics better finish the course. I would like you to: Here are the answer to your questions.

It takes over my mind so that it is all I can think about for weeks. This leads to instant insomnia and loss of appetite. I have been diagnosed with OCD. I describe this as an 'OCD of my thoughts', not physical actions like checking locks, straightening up, etc. I have been taking Zoloft (Sertraline) for the past 19 years. Most of these 19 years, I have been taking 100 mg. This drug has worked well for me with little side effects. Two years ago I reduced it to 50 mg. Then, recently I stopped taking it completely. This lasted for about seven weeks and then I had a change at work which caused anxiety to hit me like a ton of bricks. So, I started taking 100 mg for four days and then increased to 150 mg quickly. I have been taking this along with Xanax for the past five weeks. The difference between this episode and the past episodes is that I constantly feel an increased heart rate and shakiness for no real reason. I cannot relax and go about my day normally. And I feel the need to take Xanax every day. I have read that taking Zoloft can actually cause anxiety. My doctor says that anxiety from medication feels different from anxiety caused by an actual situation. He also is alright with me increasing my dosage to 200 mg, but I am fearful that it will cause more anxiety. I am wondering if I actually need to reduce my dosage to 100 mg. Please reply back with facts, and not information that may make me worry more. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to ciliniq.com. I can understand you well. But, I ask you not to worry as many of my patients who went through anxiety disorder have recovered completely thanks to psychotherapy. Anxiety disorders are a category of mental disorders characterized by feelings of anxiety and fear, where anxiety is a worry about future events and fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as a racing of the heart and shakiness. There are a number of anxiety disorders including generalized anxiety disorder, a specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and panic disorder among others. While each has its own characteristics and symptoms, they all include symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety medicines alone cannot cure anxiety disorders mainly because medicines do not alter behavior. Behavior change and continuous practice of the changed behavior cure anxiety. I suggest anxiety education, progressive counseling and progressive psychotherapy. I assure you complete cure. I need to know more about your anxiety so that I will be able to diagnose it properly and provide you tips to overcome and manage your anxiety. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common mental health problem. Symptoms typically include recurring thoughts and repetitive actions in response to the recurring thoughts. A common example is recurring thoughts about germs and dirt, with a need to wash your hands repeatedly to clean off the germs. However, there are many other examples like sexual thoughts, counting, checking, orderliness, etc. The usual treatments are cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant medicine, or both. Treatment often works well to reduce the symptoms and distress of OCD greatly. Take care.

I have a thought that always people in my surroundings are looking at me. So I would rather be at home. I do not like using the phone. I am taking Klonopin 2 mg 3 times a day. But I am not taking it now as I am travelling with my husband state to state for his job. With regards to anxiety my symptoms are extreme worry, classic panic attacks sometimes 5-6 times a day, feel hard to breath, stomach sick. I do not get motivated to do anything like shower, changing clothes, cleaning house, keep a job. My husband will do most of the shopping including grocery. I forgot any type of social get together with friends and family. I do not even visit my in-laws. I feel tiredness in my whole body, a tense feel and headache. When I take Klonopin these symptoms will disappear. I have been on this medication since 13 years. Can anxiety be the cause for such issues or is it something else? I wish to spend some time outside with my family. Please explain what is wrong with me.","Doctor":"Hi. You are suffering from panic attacks with agoraphobia (fear to go to public place). You are taking Benzodiazepine (Klonopin-Clonazepam) of very high dose. Continue it but should take it occasionally only, as high chance of dependence is there. You should start an antidepressant, which is useful in panic attacks, for maintenance. Take tablet Pari CR (Paroxetine) 12.5 mg for 5 days, then shift on Pari CR 25 m and continue it in the morning.You can take psychotherapy sessions (CBT - Cognitive behavioural therapy) by therapist or psychiatrist.

I looked in my mouth tonight and my bottom holes have not filled, it looks to have white/yellow stuff in it and my breath smells, no matter how many times I brush or use mouthwash. Could this be dry socket even though I am not having any pain in my gums and it is a week from when I got them removed?","Doctor":"Hello. It might be a dry socket, but usually, dry socket appears just three days after the extraction with excruciating pain and a smelly breath. If that is the case, you need to check with a local dentist stat.  However, sometimes what happens is while extracting a tooth, some sharp bony edges might remain which also cause pain post extraction. In this case, you need a radiograph/ X-ray of the involved tooth. But since you have not uploaded any such picture of X-ray, I would advise you to visit your nearest dentist.

Is it a cleft? Is it possible that you take a picture and send? If your baby is taking breastfeeds adequately and gaining weight adequately, then do not worry about the tongue tie now. We shall wait. If there is any problem with speech then we can remove the tie using cryoablation. In a kid, we will need general anesthesia for tongue tie correction.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Your period may have changed in length and days on which heavy bleeding occurs but it still falls well within the remit of a normal range. All of your investigations have been normal.

It has gone from 5.3 to 8.65 in a year. Now, let me give you the facts. We believe at his age, he might have an enlarged prostate, but none of the two doctors he has seen in the past one year has told him so. We also believe that because of his acidosis, the inflammation in his digestive system may have also contributed to this high number. He takes a lot of herbal supplements, about 15 per day, and this too may have attributed to his high number. Because of the acidosis, he has developed gluten problems and just does not eat like he used to, so he lost 25 pounds in the year. He was tested this past year and his prostate number was 6. They did a DRE test and found a nodule for which he had a transrectal ultrasound and sonogram of his prostate, liver, and kidneys, and all were alright. They just put on the report that maybe he should have more tests run. His current doctor only wants to discuss biopsies and will not listen to the reasons we have listed below. He is healthy and has no symptoms. I just need another opinion because I do not want my husband to have unneeded biopsies. We will consider an MRI, but what we want to know is this. Does it make a difference if his free PSA percentage score is 32 % as we read if it were over 25 %, chances are he does not have cancer and does it not seem plausible with the transrectal ultrasound and sonogram that he does not have cancer? Please advise. Thank you so very much for being out there for us.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome back to icliniq.com. I have gone through your query and would like to know the size of his prostate on the ultrasound scan. An increase from 5.3 to 8 in a year is significant and so is a nodule in the prostate. A free PSA (prostate-specific antigen) test can give an idea of the possibility of it not being cancer, but it is not foolproof and cannot confirm. So, I would not make a decision only on the basis of that. At your age and the given PSA levels and nodule in your prostate, you definitely need evaluation to rule out prostate cancer. An MRI initially is now becoming an option, but again a negative MRI is not sensitive enough to rule out prostate cancer. I too agree with your urologist that you need a biopsy, though it may be negative in 25 % of cases, it is for early detection of prostate cancer which gives you much better outcomes. Hope this was helpful, feel free to revert back with any questions. For further queries consult a urologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am worried about ALS. I have had a twitch in my left hypothenar muscle intermittently for three weeks or so. Perhaps a few twitches per hour followed by hours of no twitching. I also have twitches in other parts of my body quite regularly though this one is focal and the others are diffuse. I have not dropped anything. Doing self-tests, my left pinky seems a bit weaker. Though I think I have atrophy in the hypothenar, I have had three general practice doctors tell me it is just asymmetrical with my dominant right hand. The doctors have also performed basic finger strength tests (spread fingers and resist ) and they say they are normal. Reflexes are normal. No tripping, dropping, slurring, etc. Should I be worried about this given the above scenario and that doctors have told me no atrophy and no weakness? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. I read carefully your question and would explain that your symptoms are not typical of ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Benign fasciculation syndrome, an electrolyte imbalance or thyroid gland dysfunction could mimic this clinical situation.

I just read your query. The problem you mentioned here is very common and teenagers and adults face it frequently. At your age, it is still normal because erection is related to testosterone hormone (male sexual hormone) and your body is still producing it and when you sleep you may feel erections.

In addition, the count is just 15 million per ml, which is again very low.

The last one told me it is just depression and anxiety. I had mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and Modafinil tablets. Due to an overdose, I gained a lot of weight. So, I gave up on the medications cold turkey and started work outs and medications. I consulted a homeopathic doctor and started medications for depression and anxiety. I plan to go a nutritious diet for managing the depression, which lasts for three to four days when I am not stressed and longer when I am. Can a person be hypomanic for more than three weeks if he is bipolar-2? I used my willpower to accomplish more as I was moving to another country. I prayed more and started doing all the things systematically with planning.As my faith got increased, I started to become compassionate with people, and very confident about things. I was very optimistic about getting a new job and believed that God would give me everything I needed. I felt most of the favorable things happening in my life as God's actions. I felt very happy and present at the moment. I was not euphoric. I was not talking excessively, not irritable, or low on sleep. I slept for seven hours at night. I was not jumping from one idea to another or jumping from one activity to another but I was finishing tasks systematically in a calm way. Suddenly, I felt bored and depressed one day as I was not able to follow up on my exercise, diet, sleep, and prayers. Then, within two days all the systems in my life crashed. I felt depressed and anxious. But, I did not cry. I feel angry and lost in thoughts about my past. I just sit with my phone the whole day and eat a lot for many days. Then my efforts come back to get back into the system. I connect the feeling of happiness that was there a few days ago as euphoric and being productive as hypomanic. Is this bipolar 2 or just depression due to unsystematic living? If the praying and systematic part were hypomania, then if I maintain a good nutritious diet plan, do yoga and exercise twice a day and sleep for six to seven hours a day to fight the depression part, will the hypomania be controlled?","Doctor":"Hello. Hence to be clear, if these fluctuations in mood are causing you distress or dysfunction in your daily life and are not remitting on its own, only then you can consider pharmacotherapy.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Is there a possibility for normal delivery? Is there a chance for the placenta to change its position? What precautions should I take?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to iciniq.com. You are 16 weeks and 3 days pregnant as of today. Placental position, if it is anterior and covering the OS, then actually it is too early to comment on placenta previa. This can be complete or incomplete. A repeat scan needs to be done at 32 weeks to finalise the position of the placenta as at that gestation, the position of the placenta would be fixed. The placenta climbs up with increase in gestation and growing uterus. A distance of more than 2.5 cm from OS is considered safe and not previa. The precautions to be taken are avoid sexual intercourse, should avoid running, jumping, brisk walking, also avoid bending down for sweeping or mopping the floor. Please attach the USG report for further follow up with an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a Ph.D. student. I am struggling to write my thesis. I am trying hard to get it done and have progressed only little since many months. I am all time anxiety driven and I feel fatigue. Every day, I start with a hope to make progress but cannot take a single step. I lie on the bed, feel like to sleep or just waste time on social media or anything but do not do my thesis writing. I am tired of myself now. No one can understand this. My mind is full of negative thoughts whole day and I feel guilty. I have already spoilt my relations with my supervisors as I have not been able to adhere to the deadlines. In short, I have anxiety, fatigue, feeling lethargic, and lack of concentration. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. From the available description, it appears that there is a primary anxiety disorder associated with amotivation.  Other symptoms such as fatigue, loss of interest in activities which require consistent attention and concentration, lethargy, excusing yourself, spending time on activities with least importance are symptoms of anxiety as well as maladaptive behavior arising from anxiety. First of all, I like to assure you that it is a treatable problem and there is need to see a psychiatrist in your city without delay. In addition, you need to develop more healthy choices like regular exercise, healthy eating, avoidance of junk foods, plenty of fluid intakes, use of steam inhalation, deep breathing exercises to control anxiety symptoms. Although it is not possible for me to prescribe medication but I feel Prozac (Fluoxetine) with Modafinil will solve most of your symptoms. Both the medications are prescription only. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicines.

I have heard that it can only be transmitted from sexual course but I want to be sure. My fiancee also has the virus.","Doctor":"Hi. I read your query and understand your concerns. It is true that HPV (human papilloma virus) 73 is transmitted through sexual intercourse. On the current date no other mechanism is known for transmission of HPV 73. Considering the fact that your fiancee has HPV, there is high possibility of transmission to you. I must inform you that even the use of condom does not ensure 100 % protection as areas such as inner thighs are not covered with use of condom.

I stopped taking it seven weeks ago. Most of my neurological symptoms have gone. I stick to a low tryptophan diet but if I eat something higher in tryptophan or get stressed, I feel nauseous, depressed, agitated and I cannot sleep. This happens every few days. I cannot take supplements such as Vitamin D3. I am post menopausal and need calcium but I cannot eat dairy or drink milk without severe effects. My question is, will my sensitivities pass in time and will my serotonin rebalance? I am so frightened that I have permanent endocrine or brain damage. Currently, I am taking Propranolol mini pill.","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Since your serotonin syndrome is drug induced, it must be normalized within a wash out period. I mean normalized gradually once you stop it. You may take another antidepressant that is safe for you. Eating tryptophan rich foods or stress inducing some symptoms to you, I feel which may not be related to serotonin syndrome. That looks like your depression related issues only. It needs another better drugs. Please discuss with your clinician about current symptoms. Your brain and endocrine systems are normal (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Only thing you must take better antidepressants and psychological counselling. Vitamin D dosage need to be adjusted if it is causing trouble. This may not be related to serotonin syndrome.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am suffering from cold from the past two to three days. It includes sneezing, running nose, etc. The basic Cetirizine tablets never work for me. By the way, I do not have any chronic cold issues till now. It just pops up once in a while (once in three or four months) and I depend on Cheston Cold or Allercet cold tablets for two to three days and the issue gets resolved but my situation is different for me now. Even these tablets are not helping me now. Previously, I used to take Avil 50 once whenever I had cold and it used to work like a miracle. So, I thought it would be wise to take an ENT specialist's advice in this case rather than depending on general physician. I do not have fever. So I request you to let me know if you could suggest me a better and much much more effective medicine which I can use anytime whenever I get cold. I am currently taking Allercet cold (thrice a day for cold), Azithral 500 (once in a day, for two days for minor throat infection), Bepozic (antihistamine) ( once in a day for acute urticaria on my body which is almost recovering).","Doctor":"Hi. I would like to know few details regarding your symptoms. One more thing, you should never take Azithral (Azithromycin) for two days. You should take it for at least three days (for minor as well as severe infection). Taking antibiotics for lesser days will make you resistant to it. You can continue Allercet (Cetirizine) cold as of now, and watch. Simultaneously you start taking steroid and Azelastine nasal spray that is Duonase nasal spray (one puff each nostril twice daily for three weeks and then one puff each nostril once daily at night for another three weeks). Consult with your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take medications with their consent. I strongly feel that you have allergic rhinosinusitis based on your history. Please give a detailed history and also investigations are needed to come to the final diagnosis. Taking random medications will not help.

The boy was born with c-section and apgar score was low immediately after delivery but improved in the following measurements. He lived with us at home. In the period from January 2009 to April 2012 his social life was limited because we stayed away from our home town. His rapport with other kids was very limited ane then improved after April 2012. The boy is always anxious, nervous and aggressive at home with his younger brother and mother. When we go out, he cannot interact with strangers easily. Even with cousins he does not interact properly, especially in the absence of us. I note in the last few months that he always puts his nails inside his mouth and there is noticable damage to his nails. He started to go to school two weeks ago, but he does not like school as well. The teacher says that he always follows her and cries even during break time. We really have difficult time with him. His academic level at school is the lowest among other children. I do not know what is the probable diagnosis for his case. I have tried to book an appointment with qualified psychiatrist here but no available doctor until end of October. Today I went to pick him up from school and he was crying there and when we arrived home he was hungry and he refused to tell us anything about school. So we asked his elder cousin who said he cried the whole day and was following the teacher. Teacher also told me the same thing and he is not able to concentrate in the lessons. I hope you can find a solution for the this problem of our child. Do you suggest using medicine, behavioural therapy or any other suggestions?","Doctor":"Hi. Consult a psychiatrist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a cracked tooth that developed an abscess under it. It took two weeks to wait for the endodontist appointment, so I started taking an antibiotic when the abscess started to grow. Finally had my appointment today and the endodontist is keeping me on the antibiotic one more week, and injected something into the abscess but did not lance it. Now it is huge and the pressure is terrible and causing a lot of pain. I am unsure what to do and if it will now drain on its own. Is this normal, because I can only find information about lancing abscesses, not injecting them with medicine. Currently I am taking Clindamycin.","Doctor":"Hi. Antibiotics for the abscess is always not the first choice to do actually. Moreover, you had mentioned that it is a cracked tooth. I wonder how deep is the crack so that it fits the criteria for root canal treatment. With all these kept in mind, I guess your endodontist has opened up the tooth which is the first step of root canal treatment and packed the canals with medicated paste which will help to heal the abscess. Not all dental abscesses are meant to be lanced off as you think. The endodontic treatment itself is an intraoral approach to reducing the infection of the tooth. Since the tooth pulp chamber is opened up, the pus from the abscess would drain through it. As far as you are not in pain, it is definitely safe to do.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is the fourth week now, and I still feel as though I have this pit in my stomach, which I am always trying to fight to prevent another full-blown panic attack. I feel horrible, and I just want to feel myself again. The Doxylamine seems to help calm me down a little, but this is not an ideal way to cope, as I cannot be tired all the time. Most of the time these days, I feel fine, but when I am not being proactive or doing something, I feel it creeping on, and I dread the feeling. I have been feeling depressed lately as a result of all of this, and I just do not feel the same. Did I inadvertently trigger some kind of panic disorder within myself, as a result of smoking?

Anxiety disorders come under the category of mental disorders characterized by feelings of anxiety and fear, where anxiety is a worry about future events and fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms such as a racing heart and shakiness. There are a number of anxiety disorders including generalized anxiety disorder, a specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and panic disorder among others. While each has its own characteristics and symptoms, they all include symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety medicines alone cannot cure anxiety disorders mainly because medicines do not alter behavior. Behavior change and continuous practice of the changed behavior cure anxiety. I suggest you gather knowledge about anxiety, progressive counseling, and progressive psychotherapy.

Firstly, I guess you do not have any other symptoms like shortness of breath or chest pain. It is worthwhile to get yourself auscultated by a local doctor to rule out structural heart disease, although that appears to be less likely. You should avoid fatty, oily and spicy diet. Have some walk after having food instead of taking rest. Have regular sleep habits and avoid stress. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. You should get prescribed tablet Pan DSR (Pantoprazole and Domperidone) 40 mg or Esomeprazole-Domperidone combination before breakfast once a day for two weeks. Also, you should get prescribed tablet Etizola beta (Etizolam and Propranolol) 0.25/20 mg bedtime for two weeks, if the heart rate is at least more than 65 per minute. This may cause slight sedation. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. Also, try to divert your mind to other activities and do not think much about this to reduce the anxiety and nervousness.

I have been through a series of medical examinations which did not find anything. My doctors are clueless and I am desperate. I hope you may have some suggestions.Symptoms: Persistent unbearable fatigue which is worst in the morning and afternoon, worsens after eating a meal, after standing up and after drinking coffee. It gets better after lying down with legs raised and after stretching the neck and after drinking alcohol. Otherwise the fatigue prevents me from doing most normal daily activities. I can barely sit and watch videos, eat and use the toilet. I am not able to do any other work. While sitting I fall asleep during the daytime. Resting and intention tremor (while rotating the wrists). Sluggish memory, fairly frequent memory lapses (forgetting my friends names). Clumsiness - when pressing buttons on the computer or microwave I often miss the button and while opening drawers or doors I grasp air instead of the handle, etc. Eye coordination problems - while reading my eyes jump over words thereby making me misread words for something else or just omit words. Cognitive difficulty - with mental arithmetics and planning and I often mispronounce words or use different words than the appropriate one in a sentence during speech. Post-void urinary dribbling and frequent defecation. Flashes of past memory like dreams while awake, euphoria turning into nausea and extreme tiredness afterwards. Pain in the neck, muscle cramps and stiffness in the neck and TMJ area. (I have had orthodontic treatment for the past 2.5 years for correcting underbite). Slightly dislocated coccyx. Pain and pressure behind the eyes, urge to blink often. Tests done and reports: MRI scan of the brain: normal.

All the symptoms which you have mentioned cannot be explained on the basis of anxiety disorder or depression. The points against anxiety and depression are resting and action tremors, problems with eye coordination and the memory lapses that you are experiencing. You have already undergone almost all required tests in neurology. But a few more tests are necessary: Complete neurological examination by a neurologist - this is the most important test. Screening for heavy metals. At this stage, I am not able to make a provisional diagnosis for you but there is a possibility of Synucleinopathy (group of disorders associated with abnormal deposition of synuclein), if your age is beyond 50 years.Revert back with the reports to a neurologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 23 years old and mostly likely anemic. Before two months, my period lasted longer than normal and the bleeding stopped after 8 to 10 days. My last period started on the correct date and I am still bleeding. I thought it was finished after my normal five day streak, but I leaked blood all over my clothes unexpectedly a day or two later. I did not think much of it and just used tampons until I was sure it was done. I had sex with my boyfriend and discovered that I was still very much bleeding. The strangest thing is the odor graduated from that bloody smell to a foul odor and the color changed on my tampon. It ranges from dark brown to yellowish to green with dabs of bright red. It is also only drawn into two particular places on the tampon, the right and just a small spot in the left center. The tampon is also never drenched in blood; it is a light flow just in those two areas. I am not experiencing any kind of pain or discomfort at all. I have only had unprotected sex with my boyfriend for two years. I know for a fact that he has not had any other sexual partners. I have always been regular, but this is the first time I have ever experienced this.","Doctor":"Hi. You can bleed more sometimes due to irregular menses because of hormonal (chemical) levels of your body and its effect. But, you can bleed also due to cervical erosions and infection there. I personally never recommend tampons. Because, your menstrual blood contains some bacteria and pathogens which can infect. And, when you use tampons due to the collected blood, it gives a media to growth of that bacteria. The body can resist infection up to a limit and as the limit crosses you get signs and symptoms of infection for which you may have to take treatment. Now in your case, foul-smelling discharge and discoloration of the discharge are the signs of infection. Now I have to see, actually where the infection is. So best consult your nearby gynecologist. Let him see where the infection is and what type of discharge actually is. And, if required, then send the discharge for examination. By this we will know the type of infection and can give treatment accordingly. Most probably you are having history, which seems to be likely bacterial vaginosis. It is a mixed infection. You will need to take the antibiotic course for 10 to 15 days and follow some precautions to avoid recurrence. Now, as far as antibiotics are concerned, I have to see the first type and nature of discharge and smell. So, better get consulted nearby for that. Kindly keep up the following precautions: These will help to avoid recurrence. And firstly, complete the drug course to completely eradicate the infection.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I had not been to a dentist in about a decade (I am 30 years old) till five months back. I had not had any problems or noticeable cavities till about a year ago, when a fair few seemed to pop up all at once, a few on the front of my incisors. Now I admit, I had slacked off in adulthood on brushing, just once a day did not floss, and had slacked off even more in the last two years due to extreme depression (a mixture of forgetting and just not caring). But I have now started getting the cavities filled, the ones visible when I smile with the composite resin, the first cavities done this way were filled about two months ago, the most recent about three weeks ago.I noticed some sudden extreme sensitivity to cold in the area of the oldest filling, went to look in the mirror, and I noticed there is the start of a hole in the resin (more of a pit or dent, really, than a true hole, at this point), and also noticed that there is just starting to be the barest hint of degradation in the most recent one. And I would like to know why. Since going back to the dentist, I have started to try to be better about my oral care, I am still not where I am sure any dentist would like me to be, again due to the depression. But I do make sure I brush at least once. I mean the math, to me, just does not seem to add up, even considering the resin likely is not as strong as tooth enamel. If it took literal years for the cavities to even start forming when I was brushing once a day, how is it the resin is breaking down so fast when I am keeping to that schedule, and about half the time actually do what I should be doing (that is brushing twice a day and flossing). Are my dentists just using substandard resin materials, or (is that even a thing that is possible?) I am worried because I have a fair number of cavities left to go, some of them to be filled with the composite resin, and if they are going to break down this fast even with proper or most proper care, I mean, the hell am I supposed to do, just not eat?","Doctor":"Hey. Do not worry. The reason could be either your enamel is weak or maybe you are chewing or biting hard on those filled surfaces in the front areas of teeth. The composite filling does not have much strength when done in deep caries of back teeth or a larger portion of front teeth. We usually advise patients with composite filling in front tooth edges not to bite there. Can you please send me the image of the areas where you have complaints? And if you had taken depression medicines in the past, it can cause dryness of mouth, which in turn causes caries or cavity (new and progression in old ones). Regarding oral hygiene, more than the quantity of brushing, the brushing method matters as wrong technique will not cleanse plus cause abrasion of teeth leading to sensitivity. Follow bass sulcular method (google it for video), gargle after every meal. Reduce the use of mouthwash as it can cause staining and dry mouth. Take care.

Now, there is as slight swelling and it hurts when walking. I am unable to walk smoothly. I partially drag the foot when walking. Hence, I request your advice on the following: When will my walking be normal? What should I do to expedite the same?","Doctor":"Hello. 2, 3, and 4 metatarsal fracture can vary from undisplaced midshaft fractures to head fracture which affects forefoot (front part of the foot) to the base of metacarpal fracture which can vary depending on the anatomy of the fracture and thus the treatment also varies. An X-ray of your foot at the time of injury and probably a fresh X-ray would have been more appropriate to discuss about the condition. Coming to your questions now: The fracture should consolidate in a favorable position after which foot movements and walking can be normalized. Ideal healing time for foot injury is 6 to 12 weeks depending on the fracture. Healing is a normal process, Its rate cannot be increased. However, avoiding factors that impair healing is recommended.

She sat well through the drilling, then when he was doing the pulpectomy, she screamed and choked and flailed around. The dentist seemed unable to handle it all and he said she had a hyperemic pulp. He said he could not stop the bleeding. He was worried for my daughter from the crying and choking. So, he put a temporary filling over it and stopped. He said he was concerned it may bleed and cause pressure inside the molar. Pain and or abscess or infection. I follow up with him in one week just to check it out. Is this something I should be concerned with or is it common? It sounds very scary that her tooth could be bleeding from inside. I am just wondering if I need a second opinion, she needs to see her pediatrician or what. I am nervous. Is this a common thing or do I need a new pediatric dentist?","Doctor":"Hello. It is normal for the pulp to bleed profusely when it is a little enlarged inside, like a polyp. The dentist could have easily managed her, had he given a local anesthesia (just a drop would have numbed it) directly inside the pulp when doing the root canal treatment. He could have then removed the pulp polyp and done the remainder. As soon as the pulp polyp is scraped away, the bleeding would have stopped instantly. Do not worry. In the next appointment, he may do it. Anyway, the bleeding is nothing to worry about, as it will not cause any severe pain now due to pressure. But, next time, when he opens it, ask him to put local anesthesia drop inside or inject it directly inside (all this after giving inhalation gas), and then do the procedure.

But it is quite swollen and hurts to touch. I blew my nose this morning and there was a bit of blood. I have also had a few headaches. Should I go get it checked out or am I fine?","Doctor":"Hello. You have sustained some bruise and possibly internal injury over the bony dorsum of the nose. This is the area of nasal bones, their suturing with each other and their junction with the frontal bone (forehead bone).  If you were to come to me, I would check for crepitus and palpate the whole area for any deformity, step change, tenderness, bubbles feeling, etc. It may be difficult for you to do on your own and arrive at right inferences. Next, what I would do is to get a CT scan of nose and sinuses. If a CT is not available or not feasible, we can go for a plain radiograph of nasal bones. However, a CT is preferred. The radiological investigation whether CT or X-ray will help us know whether there is any fracture of nasal bone or septum or orbital margins or rim and if there is any collection of fluid or inflammation. Depending on that we can tailor our treatment. If there is a Y-fracture, we correct immediately. Suppose it is more than 48 hours after sustaining the injury, then we wait for two weeks for healing to get over and then subsequently plan a rhinoplasty surgery to correct any remnant deformity. Right now there is swelling and so we cannot infer anything concrete without doing an investigation. Hence go ahead and get the investigation and we shall help you on how to go about with it. Since you are 18 years old and the nose is a prominent area of the face and very importantly concerned with the overall beauty of the face, I would suggest you go and get the tests done and follow up with us. Till then, to relieve pain Tylenol (Paracetamol) as per your weight, taken twice or thrice daily. To relieve edema take Trypsin-Chymotrypsin-Rutopside-Bromelain combination which is anti-inflammatory and helps relieve edema of the nose.

Skin prick test, RAST test to detect hypersensitivity or allergens, thyroid hormone (T3, T4, TSH) to detect hormonal deficiency, CXR (chest x-ray) to detect any abnormality in the chest, ECG (electrocardiogram) for cardiac status, liver function test, serum electrolytes, etc. At first, we should find out the causes that are responsible for the swelling and then treat them accordingly. So you should continue your current medications and inform me after getting the investigation results in your hand, then I will try to treat you further."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I had a wisdom tooth pulled four months back. A month later, I developed a smooth patch on the tongue that would heal and come right back in the same spot. I have never drunk, or smoke, and no family history of oral cancer. I am really scared it keeps coming back. There is no pain, just an ugly spot. I am afraid I have cancer. Please help. I cannot sleep. I used to take Nystatin, salt water rinse, and Clindamycin. Currently, I am taking Meclizine.","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the picture you have attached along with the complaint (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The smooth patch on your tongue does not seem to be caused by the wisdom tooth extraction.  Basically, your tongue is not in a normal appearance. It has the yellowish white patch throughout the top surface with this newly formed smooth patch. This condition is called oral thrush, a fungal infection. You have also mentioned a history of Nystatin which is an antifungal medication used for oral thrush. I am unsure if you are even aware of it. I wonder even after you had the medication applied, this whitish thing has not gone away. But do not worry. This is not any cancerous situation. But the white patches on the tongue or anywhere else in the oral mucosa could be precancerous and that is when you have to go through a swab test to find out which micro-organisms are exactly causing it. Even in your case, if you have not had a swab test before I reckon you get one soon with your dentist. This is just to confirm it is a fungal infection and take medication accordingly. Oral thrush could also be a cause of any underlying disease. So please make sure you get it tested and treated for it. The treatment would include a change in diet, antifungal therapy, multivitamin therapy and oral hygiene procedures.

Then it thinned up again and ended with brown blood. Why?","Doctor":"Hello. How are you doing? The possibilities for this periods are: For normal bleeding, you need a normal hormonal support to the endometrium, ovulation and the proper and complete bleeding. But, in your history I note your BMI (body mass index) is very high, Your expected weight is 52 to 56 kg. This extra fat is converted to hormones in the body which alters the normal hormone balance, leading to the poor formation and improper bleeding, which can appear as such a brown discharge, fleshy mass, and mucoid discharge. This needs only weight reduction by at least four to six kg. Any sudden increase or decrease in weight can affect these hormones. Another possibility is an infection around the uterus. If you have any yellowish or white or grayish discharge with or without itching or foul smell especially after sex and periods, pain in the lower abdomen before periods, feverish feeling, this could be an infection in the inner lining. So, the bleeding will be lesser in amount with fleshy masses, brownish and painful. This needs an evaluation by a gynecologist and a good course of antibiotics and antifungal medicines for you and your partner. Periods plus or minus seven days the expected date is normal, so two days is alright. Hope I have clarified your query. Do write back if any more queries.

As you are on regular medication for hypertension, I just want to clarify when you were diagnosed and since when are you taking the medications. Also, please specify the name of the medication and its dosage. Hypertension at this early age is not so common unless there is a previous family history or in patients with severe stress. Regarding this hypertension, I think it is better to go with stress management and lifestyle modifications like diet and regular physical exercises will be enough rather than going for medications. Regarding cholesterol levels, it is better to have a protein-rich food rather than an excess amount of carbohydrates. The pulse rate is in the normal range. Try to be stress-free at work so that everything will come to normal. I just want you to have a BP recording for the next three to four days without using BP medication.

His mother has accompanied him since then. However, we noticed that he is suffering from depression. Immediately, he was referred to a psychiatrist. He also underwent some counseling sessions by an expert counselor. For about 2 to 3 months, his studies were almost none, although he used to attend the classes. In the meantime, he was also averse to attend the classes. Gradually, he started attending the classes regularly. Later on, apart from attending regular classes (5 to 6 hours), he studies for about 2 to 2.5 hours per day regularly. Now, it seems that he is alright. But, still, he is not that dedicated to studies the way he was used to before the depression. As per our perception he is alright now and should gradually devote more time to study. His treatment is still going on. Now, we are skeptical about how far the treatment will last. Is it because of the pills that he is not that much interested in studies? The doctor is not properly guiding us. What we should do? How far this treatment will still go on?

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

There is no other pain or symptom associated with it. Could it be something serious?","Doctor":"Hello. The dark brown vaginal discharge that you are experiencing, especially after masturbation and usually in the second half of the cycle is often due to luteal phase defect which indicates progesterone deficiency. So, it is suggested that you should get your serum progesterone levels done on day 21 of your cycle. If they are less than 21 g/dL, then you may need to be placed on cyclical progesterones to avoid such episodes of intermenstrual bleeding. Also other causes can be endometrial polyp, fibroid or even sometimes ovulation mid-cycle bleeds, which is so often confused for abnormal uterine bleeding. If the test is normal, then the next step would be to get an ultrasound pelvis to rule the above causes. However, such bleeds if in excess can be acutely controlled with antifibrinolytics like Tranexamic acid tablets, which can control such episodes. But, if the cause is progesterone deficiency, then progesterone supplementation shall be required.

If no unusual foul odor or curdy white discharge, therefore no sign of infection. Itchiness can be secondary to irritation whether chemical or mechanical. Chemical in the form of the soap used or feminine wash and mechanical in the form of panty liners, pads, or even underwear. For now, infection cannot be totally ruled out since it can be early infection wherein the discharge is still pooling inside the vaginal canal. I would suggest for you to use feminine wash with Chlorhexedine content once a day for three consecutive days like gyne pro feminine wash. For bath soap use only hypoallergenic soap or mild baby soaps. Do not use shavers in the feminine area. Use cotton underwear and no panty shields, please. Pat dry the area every after washing and change underwear as often as possible. Take also antihistamine tabs like Claritin, or Loratadine 10 mg once a day or any anti-allergy medicines once a day to decrease the feeling of itchiness. Irritation.

Actually, the chances of conception and having a healthy pregnancy decrease after the age of 30. After 35, the risk of having babies with Down's syndrome increases significantly. So it is best advised medically to conceive sooner. Both your health and medical parameters will be able to establish better on your chances of having a healthy pregnancy later on. Personally, I have had patients conceive naturally or with minimum medical help even at 35 and 40 and have had successful pregnancies and healthy babies.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been experiencing upper left abdominal pain just beneath lower ribcage and on the opposite side in the back. I have intermittent, dull, and deep chronic pain. I am 43 years old, nonsmoker but consumes alcohol (not for the last four months). My blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. I am currently on Omeprazole 20 mg daily (one month). I am diagnosed with pneumonia and pulmonary embolism. It is confirmed by chest CT. I was prescribed Pradaxa for three months (stopped taking medication on Mark 26). I have a history of acid reflux, sleeps on a 6-inch wedge pillow to manage the symptoms. Tests I underwent are: Abdominal CT with contrast: unremarkable, mild diverticulosis, not considered relevant to pain. Chest CT with contrast: unremarkable, PE and pneumonia cleared. Blood tests all normal, no sign of pancreas or kidney trouble. My primary care physician suggests pain is associated with PE. My pulmonologist says it is very unlikely to be associated with PE and recommends to confer with a gastroenterologist. Could this be an ulcer or some other issue within the stomach or GI tract? Perhaps caused by the Pradaxa medication? Would the abdominal CT have uncovered peptic cancer or other serious GI issues? What further testing would you recommend? Should I wait to see if things get better or act soon? If it is safe to wait, how long should I give it?","Doctor":"Hello. I must appreciate the detail history you provided which is very helpful in diagnosing your condition. After reviewing your history, in my opinion, this pain is not related to pulmonary embolism. It looks like to be associated with some gastritis and stomach issue. Now coming to your queries, the CT Abdomen has ruled out serious abdominal issues such as malignancy but it could not rule out peptic ulcer disease. You can just wait for it and take the medications which I am prescribing. I do not think that waiting is going to cause any further issues as it does not look like to be something serious. Take the following treatment for two weeks and if no improvement then we can consider EGD. None at the moment. Gastritis. Peptic ulcer disease. Esophagitis. Gastritis. Continue Omeprazole but increase it to twice daily before meals. Syrup Gaviscon (Alginate) 10 ml three times daily after meals. Both these for two weeks. If no improvement will consider EGD."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have had irregular periods for months. I am experiencing abnormal periods where I am bleeding every other week. Sometimes the bleeding lasts a few days whereas sometimes it lasts at least eight days. More recently, I have had my worst period. I have had it 10 days then off for three days and then back on again for another one. I am currently on a period and it does not look like it will go soon. They are not particularly heavy periods for me and are both a mixture of different shades of red. I currently take the Norethisterone, the only tablet for contraceptive. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. The contraceptive efficacy of the Norethisterone is quite less and if you are taking it irregularly then also it may cause a breakthrough bleeding. So the important thing is to get a pregnancy test as this is the most common cause to rule out. If this is ruled out then irregular intake of hormones is the second cause. I suggest you get a gynecological ultrasound and a serum beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) done. AUB (abnormal uterine bleeding), pregnancy, and hormonal imbalance are the differential diagnoses. The treatment plan is to stop taking the pills at present. Let us know the reports of the investigation. Preventive measures include the use of a combination of oral pills. Follow up with the reports.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

My little brother who is 15 years old has struggled with depression and is suicidal or so he claims.

Recently, things have been getting out of control. He has crashed the family suburban, taken a handful of Ibuprofen pills, threatened to kill himself, and attacked my mom when she said he could not go out with his friends. When the cop came he started swearing at him trying to get arrested which the cop would not do. It got worse until the cop came back and took him away to a correctional facility.

The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

At my 1 hour test, my levels were at 170, which was high, but they told me it was low. I was scheduled for 3 hours test and was told to eat sugar treats and sugar drinks three days before my test and then to fast on the day of the test. I failed all the three tests. I have been told that I was obviously going to have sugar in my system, so that is why it came out high. Was the test done right?","Doctor":"Hi. Let me make a few corrections in the methods done. I have not heard of the methods done. Gestational diabetes is caused by the hormones of the pregnancy, which appears in pregnancy only after 26 to 28 weeks, the time when pregnancy hormones are at the highest level. So, any diabetes occurring before 28 weeks is called pregestational diabetes. It is important to know because in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) by 28 weeks the baby is fully formed and abnormal sugars cannot lead to any abnormalities in babies other than an increase in birth weight and amniotic fluid. But, if the sugar rises early as in your case (before 28 weeks) this can affect the normal growth of baby's tissue. You will need to be put on Insulin to correct sugar before any damage is done. We do not need to give such challenges in pregnancy to know that your sugar level is high. I would suggest you undergo HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) as this checks your blood sugar level of last three months. Your level should be less than 6.5 %. If it is more than this, then you need to be treated with Insulin. Have fasting blood sugar at the morning after the overnight fast of 8 hours and postprandial sugar after 2 hours of food. These two blood levels will help you decide the doses of Insulin. Also, you can take a second opinion from another doctor.

I have that caliber which I know and I believe I can, but the problem with me is nowadays, I take everything for granted. I lost my father three years back. Till then, everything was fine as my bonding with him was like a friend. I used to discuss a lot of things with him just like a friend. After him, I have to take care of the responsibility of my family which was not like that actually. I have spent a big amount of his savings. Now even I know the financial stage of my family. If I do not get a government job, it will not be possible to live the life the way I want to. I am not happy at all with my private sector job. A year back, I had a breakup with my longtime girlfriend.The problem now is although I know the outcome of everything, I am not working towards my goal .instead, I am a regular drinker. I really want to stop drinking. I keep myself motivated that I will not drink today but somehow I do end up drinking. It all started after my father's death. I do not want to make it an excuse for my drinking habit but still, I do not know how to leave this habit. I am losing so much due to these things. I feel like I am behaving like a numb person even after knowing everything. I live alone as well. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your problem and understand your concern. It is clear that after the death of your father, you were not able to handle the pressure of responsibility and started drinking alcohol and spending excessively. As you are regularly drinking for the last three years and now want to quit, that is good. Consulting a psychiatrist in person will be very helpful and he will ask for some investigation like liver function tests, USG abdomen, etc and treat you accordingly. Management of alcohol use is very important and it depends upon many things including total daily intake, duration, last intake, the status of the liver, etc. Sometimes what happens is that due to stress and family pressure, etc. the person is not able to take the right step forward and may take a wrong path like in your case. As of now, you are motivated. So, a consultation with a psychiatrist as soon as possible is important to manage alcohol-related problems and other psychological problems if he detects any. Similarly continue to work to get a job in the government sector, as it is difficult due to lack of enough vacancies. So, keep studying. Do regular exercise and take adequate sleep.

My history includes two cesarean sections, PCOS, adenomyosis, dysmenorrhea and amenorrhea. Now, I am suffering from irregular and very painful periods. I am getting heavy clots for three days and bleeding for the next four days. My cycle varies between 23 and 45 days. The pain has been increasing and the cycle becomes more irregular for the past 12 months now. Other symptoms are irritability, night sweats, sore breasts, feverish days leading up to the period. My current medications are Pristiq, Lithium and Dothep. The plan of treatment was to insert Mirena. However, the attempt failed due to closed cervix. I was booked in for Misoprostol (vagina) and attempt Mirenas again. If this does not work, then open hysterectomy will be considered as laparoscopy cannot be done due to scarring. Both, my mother and maternal grandmother had hysterectomy before 40 years of age. Should I seek a second opinion or further testing? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I went through your query. At your age, instead of hysterectomy, Mirena is a better option. Misoprostol is very effective in opening the uterine cervix and most likely the procedure will be successful. Whereas hysterectomy is concerned, you can go for both laparoscopic as well as open. Previous surgeries and adenomyosis is not a problem if your surgeon is competent enough to do such surgeries. Though I would recommend you try with Mirenas (Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) as much as possible, as it would be a wonderful option for you.

We went to the doctor, and they said that there are many sores in the uterus, took a biopsy test and said there is nothing serious. After one year when she again had periods problem and pain in lower abdomen, the doctor said that there is 8 mm clot in the uterus and we can manage that with medicines and prescribed medicine. Within one month the pain subsided, and she was fine. Now she has slight bleeding continuously, discomfort in the lower abdomen feels very tired and is unable to do household chores. So again she met a doctor yesterday. Now they are saying that the clot has grown to 17 mm and we need to remove the uterus and no other options are available. Also, they said that if we leave it as such, it will change into a cancerous tumor. We are very much confused. Is it so serious? Do we need to remove uterus for this? Can this not be cured using medicines? Please give us clarity and possible options to cure this problem.","Doctor":"Hi. I do not see any reason for you to worry and there is no need for any interference. Let me explain. Fibroid and adenomyosis, the two conditions mentioned in the report, never become malignant or cancerous (attachment removed to protect patient identity). What she has is not a clot, it is thickening of the muscles in the uterus. Every month when a lady has periods, her blood flows out. But a small amount of this also flows into the muscles of the uterus, which is called adenomyosis. This can never become cancerous.  Fibroids are very common and formed by the thickening of the muscle layer of the uterus. These both conditions keep growing till the time lady has periods, which means, as long as the hormone estrogen is produced by ovaries. But these never become cancerous. Both these conditions have a common presentation. They cause pain in the abdomen during periods, excessive bleeding, weakness, and back pain. Anyway medications are the best treatment option. Surgery is never the first option. There are medications which can stop the hormones and periods, with no side effects and the symptoms will fully disappear. The best option I can suggest is tablet Novex-DS or Sevista 60 mg (Ormeloxifene) twice weekly on Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday or Wednesday and Saturday. Over a few months, the periods will stop, these problems will disappear, she will have periods once in three to four months. Do not worry; periods are not necessary for health. Over some time, the adenomyosis and fibroids will shrink. She can have it for five to six years. By then, her periods will stop on its own, and then the two conditions will not trouble anymore. Other option is using Mirena or Emily (intrauterine devices), both are Copper T like devices which contain the progesterone hormone. They stop periods and also have a suppression of hormones and the symptoms disappear. This can be kept into uterus for five years and will gradually reduce size of fibroids. Anyway, surgery is never the best option. Better try these medications, and I am sure she will be relieved of the problems.

Please give me suggestions.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). There are no major abnormalities as such. However, I have noticed the following derangements. Firstly, your Hb is borderline, and MCV and MCH are low which is suggestive of iron deficiency. So, you should once get your iron profile test done to look for iron deficiency. And if needed, iron supplements later. Also, increase intake of iron-rich food like green leafy vegetables, dates, jaggery, etc. Next is, your BMI (body mass index) falls in the overweight category, which leads to slight derangement of SGPT and slightly high BP. Also, this is the reason for your slightly deranged lipid profile. So, a healthy lifestyle and weight loss are necessary. You should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily and high-calorie diet. Have low salt diet and monitor blood pressure regularly thrice a day for one week, then once or twice a week. If BP is persistently more than 140/90 mmHg, then you should be on medicines for it. Regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging according to your capacity at least 30 minutes a day and five days a week. Lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits, fish once or twice a week, avoid meat. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. Next, your eosinophils count is slightly elevated. Do you have any allergies, etc.? If not, then you should deworm yourself once with tablet Albendazole 400 mg at bedtime once and repeat after two weeks. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts.

If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

This condition was observed 10 years back. Also, there is premature ejaculation. Other physical ailments that I have are, I am suffering from hypertension and taking Amlopres-L (Amlodipine and Lisinopril) for the last 10 years, high cholesterol and triglycerides. My cholesterol level is 225 and triglyceride is 200 for the last 12 years. I used to do frequent masturbation in early age. I do have erection during morning hours many times, particularly after sound sleep or if I had long walk previous day. I am having Sildenafil 25 mg or 5 mg Cialis, which is effective enough. But, I wish to get rid of tablet support and live natural way. I consulted urologist today and he prescribed me Nano-Leo capsules and Modula 5 mg for 10 days. I wish to have your second opinion on this.

The next day at work I notice pinkish spots when I wipe. The next morning I started heavy bleeding with small clots, but I had no pain. The bleeding only lasted for three days. I need help. I am not sure if I am still pregnant or if I had a miscarriage.","Doctor":"Hi. Sorry to hear about that and it sounds like a miscarriage. That day when urine was tested, mostly the second line was not as dark as the first. It means the hormone level was not high enough. Once you have heavy bleeding, it means the inner lining of the uterus has gone, and so pregnancy cannot stay on. The most common cause of such an early bleeding or miscarriage is anembryonic gestation or blighted ovum. Here, the egg or the sperm had some defect, and so, the embryo or the baby had some congenital problem compromising its health. Hence, it was not producing enough of hormones to support itself in the uterus. Just for confirmation have a home urine pregnancy test after bleeding fully stops. If the pregnancy has failed, then the line will be lighter or have disappeared. Also, you cannot see anything on the scan.

It has changed color, maybe a bruise or something even though it is not itchy or painful.","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, it appears to be a bruise only (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Commonly this occurs due to trauma or injury noticed or unnoticed. So do you remember any history of injury while walking, playing, driving, etc.? Is there any possibility of injury during sleep? If yes then it is fine and it will resolve in a week or two. Is it just a single bruise or multiple over the body? You should try to search at other sites as well. If multiple or there is no clear-cut history or possibility of injury, then we need to rule low platelet count as a cause for the bruise. So, you should get platelet count, and PT INR test done in order to rule out clotting problem. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts.

I consulted a cardiologist and done echo, ECG, and TMT and the reports are alright. The doctor gave me a painkiller, but still having the same problem. What could be wrong and which doctor should I consult?","Doctor":"Hello. I need to know more about the symptoms, like precipitating factors, factors that increase pain. It can be gastritis and reflux disease. Do you have upper abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, burping, increase in pain on food, sour water feeling in throat or chest burning? If yes, it further supports the diagnosis. You should avoid fatty, oily and high-calorie diet. Have some walk after having food instead of taking rest. Have multiple small meals instead of heavy meals. Have regular sleep habits and avoid stress. Lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. You will need antacids in that case. Secondly, does this pain increase on applying pressure over the area? If yes, it could be costochondritis and it is a musculoskeletal type of pain and needs prolonged NSAID therapy. Does this pain increase with deep breathing and coughing? If yes, it a pain arising from the lining of lungs and needs NSAIDs treatment and evaluation. I suggest consulting an internal medicine physician first.

I would like to know my ovulation days and if I am physically fit now. I wish to get a baby soon after this.","Doctor":"Hello. How are you doing? The ovulation day is determined based your periods duration. For a lady with 28 days cycle, ovulation will be on day 14, that is 14 days before periods. So if your cycle is regularly 30 days, ovulation is on Day 15, and so on. The first day of bleeding being day-1 of the cycle.  Now, if your cycle is irregular, the calculation is the longest cycle minus 8, and shortest cycle minus 11. The days between this is the duration of ovulation. For example, your longest cycle is 34 days and the shortest cycle is 27 days. Then, 34-8 = 26, 27-11 = 16. So, between day-16 to day-26 will be your ovulation. When you try for pregnancy, start having sex daily or on alternate days once bleeding stops till day-10 of periods. This is not for pregnancy, it is to throw out the older sperms. Then, no sex for three days. Now, young sperms accumulate. Then from day-13 have sex daily at least once for five days, later is optional. So now, young and healthy sperms are more. The older the sperms, pregnancy chances are low and such pregnancy has abortion rates too. Ensure that both of you do not have any infections or fever during that time, as that can affect the baby. I suggest you avoid any painkillers or Paracetamol as that can stop ovulation. Ovulation after a miscarriage is no different after a normal period. After a miscarriage, it is better to avoid pregnancy for three months, as the underlying cause may still be there. After that, you have to calculate using the days I have given. It is quite clearly mentioned. Hope I have cleared your query. For more information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am 58 years old. I have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism 20 years ago. I am on Eltroxin medication since then, 100 mcg daily and twice a week 150 mcg. My T3, T4, and TSH are normal as I do blood analysis every six months. I noticed I am gaining weight from three months although my diet has not changed. Should I increase the dose?","Doctor":"Hello. Since your thyroid test results are normal and considering your age, it is not advisable to increase the dose of Eltroxin just because you are gaining weight. If a person does not exercise much and after a certain age, he just keeps adding the weight every year just because aging slows the metabolism naturally. So, instead of increasing Eltroxin (Levothyroxine), I would recommend that you try to walk every day and control your diet.

He is quite active as a child with a normal height and weight according to his age. Two days back we happened to measure his blood pressure at home normally. We were quite taken aback as it was 144/100 and later also it was around 130/96 even while sleeping it is around 120/80. He is otherwise not sick, but he sweats a lot while sleeping since the time he was born. Is there any problem with his BP, we are quite worried.","Doctor":"Hi. A blood pressure of 120/80 is definitely very high for a child of 4 years and 6 months. There are various causes for increased blood pressure at this age like renal parenchymal disease, COA (coarctation of the aorta), renal artery stenosis, endocrine causes like hyperthyroidism, Cushing’s endocrine syndrome, pheochromocytoma, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and hyperaldosteronism. Since there is a history of sweating, chances of hyperthyroidism are high. I suggest you to get the child examined by a pediatrician so that appropriate tests can be advised. Based on the reports, drugs for hypertension needs to be started.

Your blood report only states that you had a rubella infection only some time in life. It does not seem to be an active infection. You get it only once. So all you need to know is that that was an infection that happened long back and will not be present in the body now to affect the baby.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

What you are mentioning seems to be hydrops fetalis. Here water gets collected both inside and outside the body. Baby will have water collection in head, lungs, heart, abdomen, under the skin, in the fluid around the baby, even in the placenta. The causes are a long list. Some of the commoner causes are: Rh incompatibility (mother with negative blood group and baby with positive blood group), congenital heart diseases, lymphatic system abnormalities or parvovirus infection or musculoskeletal abnormalities or gastrointestinal abnormalities, the list is long. But, the net result is that fluid is not circulating in the blood, but outside. The pregnancy will have to be terminated (aborted) as baby cannot withstand this.

It is also a known side effect of i-pill that the following menses may be delayed or may be heavy.

But for the last three to four days, she saw some blood in her urine. Today, there was some flow like a period and we consulted the doctor. We did an ultrasound today.

Do we still have a hope to revive her pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hello. If a repeat ultrasound shows no heartbeat then she has experienced a missed abortion. This means that after the arrival of the heartbeat, the heart has stopped and the fetus is no more alive and not growing. The bleeding is nature's way of aborting the non-developing fetus. This can happen because of possible congenital abnormalities or chromosomal abnormalities in the conceptual, which was deemed naturally unfit for further survival. The initial heartbeat of 114 BPM (beats per minute) was itself low. Ideally, it should have been more than 130 in a real fetus. The bleeding may continue for a week until she aborts completely.

I am a virgin and practice good genital hygiene. But, my vaginal area is very sensitive to soap, and it feels a little bumpy. But, I am not showing any signs of vaginal cancer like pelvic pain or unusual bleeding. Could it be due to some soap allergy? How common is it for a person, who is 21 years old, to have vaginal cancer?","Doctor":"Hi. Please do not think of such rare conditions for small symptoms. May I give you a few information about cancer of the vagina. Basically cancer or dysplasia has a genetic background. In the case of a few cancers like cervical and vaginal cancers, it is due to HPV infections (human papilloma virus). Also, in oral or lung where smoking is a cause due to repeated injury by the tar. A common thing to note is, be it infection or tar; it causes repeated damage to the healthy tissue. This injury heals before it heals the next injury come and so it goes on till the healing is replaced by cells which are abnormal, which takes many years. Once these abnormal cells come on, they keep dividing into abnormal cells. After many years, these cells dominate to form cancer. Now in female genital cancer, the commonest is uterine, next ovarian, next cervical, then fallopian tubes and the rarest is vaginal. Since it is due to HPV infection, it is seen in those with sex exposure at a young age with compounding sexually transmitted diseases, HIV, multiple sex partners or repeated injury to the vagina. The best part is it has no symptoms. The cases will present with a lot of foul smelling brownish or bloody discharge usually around 50s to 60s as cancer cells take so many years to reach such a stage to be detected. From your history, I do not see even a single risk factor other than that you have a vagina.

HPV is found in 7% of all oral cavities in your country with only 1% HPV 16. There is no clear evidence how people get the virus in their oral cavities (some people never practiced oral sex). Also, the HPV is a weak virus. People with adequate immunity can overcome it easily. On the contrary, HPV 16 is the main cause of cervical cancer in females, and that is why they should be screened and get vaccinated for it. It is similar to HIV.

I went through the reports and my opinion is as follows: Diagnosis is that of squamous cell carcinoma of cervix, moderately differentiated, non-keratinizing type. Your mother has undergone Wertheim's hysterectomy, also called radical hysterectomy. This is the surgical procedure of removal of the womb along with some of the surrounding structures. Tumour cells, at any location induce inflammation. They are foreign cells, so some amount of inflammation will be found around the tumour tissue. During the time of taking bits of tissue for histopathology reporting, some tumour sections stay back in the sectioning area. These can attach to other areas and can present as tumour tissue. These are called as floaters. Parametrium is the fibrous tissue that separates the cervix from the bladder. The above mentioned tissue is found in the right parametrium and hence interpreted as floaters. Also during sectioning times, tissue overlapping can occur. Here the tumour tissue is attached to the parametrium, thereby being interpreted as parametrium invasion and hence changing the stage of the tumour. Unless tumor cells with surrounding inflammation are present, they would be floaters. Here it is only an overlap. Lymph nodes are not involved. So further treatment will not be necessary.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months).

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

I also have IgA deficiency, chronic inflammatory arthritis, autoimmune hypothyroid and low WBC count. My present condition is, for past several weeks I have been having pain in the lower left area of abdomen that goes into my left lower back and on the side of left hip or front at times. I also get pain into the lower pelvic area and sensations in my bladder like it is being kicked like when I was pregnant. I have decreased appetite, abdominal bloating and swelling on the left side of my abdomen. It is quite uncomfortable to have a bowel movement and I have increased constipation. Most of the time I have very little appetite and when I do eat I get full very quickly. I also have nausea on and off and at times it is so bad I feel as though I am going to vomit, but I have not. Three months back, I had sigmoidectomy for chronic diverticulitis. After two months that is last week due to the above symptomology, I had a CT and flexible sigmoidoscopy done as my treating doctors felt there could be a narrowing of the colon formed during the healing process. Both test were good, no problems or obvious issues (other than constipation) seen. Now I am on Prozac, Synthroid, Hydroxychloroquine, Methotrexate, Folic acid, Prevacid and Flonase. However, the pain and other symptoms have continued and actually worsened since. I am now thinking it is a cyst on my left ovary. How concerned do I need to be? And how soon should I see a doctor? I have attached my reports for your reference. Kindly guide.","Doctor":"Hello. The symptoms and an abdominal lump in the left lower abdomen with constipation and bladder symptoms with bloating and decreased appetite do indicate a possibility of a large adrenal mass which could be a developing and growing ovarian cyst or mass, which should be ruled out with an urgent ultrasound pelvis scan. As the possibility of a colonic stricture obstruction has been ruled out three months back, a sudden increase in the size of abdominal lump with pressure symptoms do indicate a possible fast growing mass or cyst. This can be a late manifestation of post sigmoidectomy stricture which was not evident then, but the possibility of an ovarian mass or an ovarian tumor cannot be ruled out.

But, I am not ovulating, and I am trying to conceive. Can I use Vitex 20 mg together with it?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? May I start by telling you few basic facts of endometriosis. Every month, when a lady has periods, most of the blood goes out through the cervix, but a small fraction goes into the abdomen through the tubes. This blood settles on and around the ovaries and uterus. This blood gradually forms a lot of adhesions and causes the symptoms of pain during periods and sex, when the adhesions get pulled. This is a progressive condition, and every month this pain and adhesions keep increasing. Now you can imagine what is the solution, stop periods. For you the best method is pregnancy. You will have 10 months of no periods and later no periods till you stop breastfeeding. Tablet Duphaston is hormone Progesterone, which is the same hormone produced by the ovaries during the second half of periods. This will keep the inner lining of the uterus thin, and as it is taken continuously, it will stop the hormonal ups and downs needed for ovulation. That is the reason you are not ovulating. This is suitable when you are not waiting to get pregnant. I am not sure how helpful tablet Vitex would be. May I suggest that you stop Duphaston, and you will have periods of few days. Just go through the following investigations to find if any problems are there: In endometriosis, the tube can get blocked, and no matter how good the egg and sperm are, they may not meet at all. Once all tests are done, have ovulation induction under a doctor's supervision. Do not delay pregnancy using small methods. Your endometriosis will be progressing every month.

She had a bad fall 1.5 years ago and suffered with a head injury with little internal bleeding and a broken arm. While in hospital, she contracted C.diff and has had several recurring bouts with it. She has had a transplant and so far she is doing well with no recurrence. She also has a fistula near the rectum from an abscess. They put in a tube to keep it open and flowing. She has always had bouts of constipation and diarrhea for years before the accident. Her cognitive functions have been diminishing. One of my brothers is living with her and care taking her for full time. She is very weak, but can walk with the aid of a walker. Before the accident, she was fine. But, she may have shown a few signs of slight memory issues and balance prior to the accident as well. Our main issue right now is loose stools with some fecal incontinence. The doctor said that the fecal incontinence is because of a weak rectum that will not hold back fecal matter. Also, the fistula is always draining. When her stools are normal, she has good energy and cognitive function. When she has loose stools, she is very weak and can hardly stand or walk. Her cognitive function is a lot worse. She gets very confused about daily items and memory issues. We are looking for supplements to keep her regular and avoid the loose stool episodes. These are recurring every other week. Being so weak at the time of an episode, the toilet and the surrounding area get very filthy. She has little control and not able to clean herself properly. Her diet is pretty good. We are trying to keep dairy items away, limiting sugar and some carbohydrates as best as we can. We are giving her Metamucil when she has loose stools as well as some ammonium. This seems to have very limited success. She is on a blood pressure medicine as well as on Coumadin. So, we have to watch for interactions between everything. Regarding supplements, right now she is taking Alpha-GPC, Prevagen and multivitamins B for cognitive help, Fish oil, turmeric and Centrum multivitamins. Any help or suggestions to prevent the loose stools without creating constipation would be appreciated. I would also like to increase her core energy, so she will feel more like moving around. We have a physical therapist at once a week.","Doctor":"Hi. I appreciate you seeking help for your mother. Well, after having gone through the case history as described, it seems her fecal incontinence is mostly of neurological origin. In the given context, I would advise that she would be clinically examined by a neuro physician first and treatment recommended appropriately. Also, self-administration of any supplementation should be avoided. For her cognitive, memory, weakness issues and health balance you can include a BRAT (banana, rice, apple, toast) diet, which will likely help improve her present diarrhea or fecal incontinence issue. Make sure that she stays well hydrated too. WHO (World Health Organization) recommended electrolyte drinks can be of help.

I would like to know how long it takes for the affected area of the small bowel to end up causing scarring (scar tissue). Do you feel if I have a lower number CRP on regular blood tests, that it should not lead to scarring, thickening or narrowing of the bowel? I have had a resection in the past and am now on 75 mg of Azathioprine after finding very minimal Crohn's after colonoscopy.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

He has one black mole on the left hand measuring about 5 mm in diameter with some elevated surface. It is from the last about one year and looking growing but can not sure about the growth. He has no complaint of itching and pain but when asked yesterday about this, today he is complaining of some itching and pain. I have one photograph of this for your review. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the pictures. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). This is a mole in medical terms it is called melanocytic nevus. Majority of them are benign and go through growth cycle of inapparent to getting dark and with age slowly losing the color. But in some rare cases, they do have inflammation and can have itching or pain. In some patients there are numerous melanocytic nevi over the body in those there is a risk factor of melanoma. Moles which is present with itching and inflammation are not necessarily melanoma, but to be on a safer side they need to be removed and sent for histopathological examination to rule out any malignant changes in them. If your child has only one nevus and it is having inflammation but no sudden increase in growth it can be safely treated with anti-inflammatory cream. But if inflammation or increase in size or different color on different parts of the mole appears you should immediately remove it and send for pathological examination. You should share the histopathology report examination with me because some melanocytic nevi they do present histopathologically as malignant but actually are not so that has to be reviewed clinically. Histopathology report will be of malignant changes but only with clinical consultation and growth parameters, we decide whether it was melanoma or not. For the time being you can apply Hydrocortisone cream twice daily and Fusidate cream twice daily for five days. Give syrup Citizen one teaspoon once daily if there is itching. I advise not to irritate it or fiddle with it that will lead to more irritation. Kindly review after five days, if inflammation persists or there is an increase in size, it needs to be removed and sent for histological examination. By the time lockdown will also be over so you can always do that it will be a minor procedure and will be done under local anesthesia can be completed within half an hour. Genetic. Excision biopsy.

The X-ray of the left leg had the problem of soft tissue noted. Please find the X-ray of the ankle and that of the hip and knee attached.

I am just wondering if it saw my abdomen since the apron was over it. I have a bulge in my left abdomen.","Doctor":"Hi. The lead guards used during scan prevent harmful radiation effects to your thyroid, ovaries, and breast and hence are used as protection. These aprons do not obliterate the radiations and all the organs covered are visualized minus the harmful effect of X-rays.  For the bulge, it can be a small hernia or a lipoma.

Is that dangerous?","Doctor":"Hi. Rabies for sure is dangerous. Only one case is reported in the world to be able to survive in your country after having rabies. But, it all depends upon how much chances of getting rabies. With needle stuck I do not believe there are many chances also and chances are high with bite. Also, laboratory mice are not a wild animal. They are grown in laboratory, so very minimal or almost no chances I believe.  Also, you can observe mice for a week. If it dies, you can complete vaccination. If it stays healthy, there is no need. Also, your symptoms were likely associated with anti-rabies antibodies that are given post-exposure along with vaccination, with next three vaccinations less likely to have these symptoms.

I have been experiencing fatigue and weight loss for last few weeks. I have gone through some routine lab test and found that some test results are out of the normal range. Iron profile: iron 153, UIBC 96 (low‌), TIBC 249, saturation % 61.40 (high). Are the above results an indication of any health issue or disease like hemochromatosis?","Doctor":"Hello. Serum iron is a bit on the high normal side and TIBC/ UIBC is on the lower side. The rest of the reports are fine. ESR is normal, so it makes the possibility of chronic inflammatory illness to be less likely. However, your iron profile is not complete, serum ferritin value is not there. You should request the laboratory to test it again. Ferritin will indicate the amount of excessive iron in the body. If ferritin is elevated, then it suggests iron overload in you and in that case you will need further investigations like HFE mutation testing, liver, and cardiac MRI, etc. So, on priority, you should get serum ferritin level done to look for a possibility of iron overload. You also request for CRP test as an alternative evidence for any inflammatory disease. It is similar to ESR. Meanwhile, do you have any history of blood transfusions, family history of any blood disorders, acute febrile illness recently? Regarding lymph nodes, small and painless lymph nodes size 1.5 cm are considered normal for armpit. So it is better if you can get it examined by a local physician.

When my husband tries to insert, I get so scared and never allowed him to penetrate. Even though we tried from different positions, it still does not work. He is very understanding. We only enjoy foreplay. Recently, I got to know I have septate hymen which can be 4 to 5 mm and I have heard with a septate hymen, intercourse is very painful and that makes me more scared. I want to enjoy sex and get pregnant as soon as possible. We both are very upset about this. Is there any medicine where there will be no pain during intercourse? Please help me. I am having a very bad time.We had visited a sexologist. After consultation and some tests, he has given medicine for both of us. For me, it is two medicines - one for reducing anxiety (Bupron SR 150) and another one for making mood (Etilaam MD 0.5) and for my husband to increase testosterone level (testostone supplement) and Tadgo 10 mg (before intercourse) but till now it is not working at all.

I have gone through your problem and understand your concern. The drugs you are currently taking is quite helpful in some cases and not in few cases. From the description provided, it appears that because of one or other reason you never actually allowed your husband to do penetrations, it may be possible that either you have vaginismus or afraid excessively of sex that it may be very painful. In reality, sex is not painful. So, during sex therapy, the couple is helped by explaining the details of anatomy and how you can enjoy normal sex without too much worry and sometimes with help of some models or technique described by Masters and Johnson. Medicine or gel such as Lignocaine gel can be applied to the genitals, that reduces the pain sensation. Medicines other than what you are taking, like aphrodisiac or supplement such as Nanoleo total or Tetrafol plus, are helpful to some extent. Testosterone can be taken as a tablet or as an injection to increase its concentration by supplements. If the septate hymen is too thick and does not allow either finger or any other objects then surgery is advised. There are few instruments available in different sizes, they are used to dilate vagina by inserting them in the vagina, beginning from small size to larger size, in step by step. You can consider them as well. Feel free to ask if you have any questions.

Periods occurs with medication. With discontinuation of the medicine, problem reoccurs. Now my periods is normal with medication, but still this time my periods is delayed for 28 days. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. You are suffering from a condition called polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). It is normally found in 5-10% of girls and is probably of genetic origin. The treatment is lifestyle modification such as healthy diet and regular exercise (at least 45 minutes of sweat inducing exercise daily). You need to reduce weight to achieve healthy BMI (body mass index). With obesity and PCOS, there is increased risk of diabetes, hypertension and endometrial cancer. Ideal weight for your height should be less than 55 kg. For regularization of menses, you need to take combined oral contraceptive (OCP) like Ovral L (combination of estrogen and progestin) regularly or Progesterone tablets regularly (Medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg twice daily for five days, every 30 days) before marriage. After marriage, when you plan for pregnancy, you will need medicines to induce egg formation and ovulation (which is lacking in PCOS women). You need to take these medicines regularly to induce period to avoid endometrial cancer in future. If period does not resume spontaneously after weight reduction, there is no alternative to medicines and you have to take them almost lifelong.

I have heart palpitations quite frequently but these felt different. They were a but thump behind my sternum, several times in a row. The EKG reading from urgent care says “sinus arryhtmia”. I have had many EKGs done before but it has never said that. Is this of concern?","Doctor":"Hello. Your ECG is fine and sinus arrhythmia is normal phenomenon, where heart range varies with respiration. It may not be evident always or depends on sensitivity of machine, and also it is more pronounced, detectable when one is breathing heavily or rapidly. So it is not a matter of worry at all.  Next thing, were you also having palpitations when ECG was taken or subsided by that time? Because considering symptoms of palpitations and chest discomfort, its important to rule out possibility of cardiac arrhythmias like PSVT/ paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which are intermittent and ECG would be absolutely normal at other time. So normal ECG does not rule out possibility of arrhythmia.  So you should either have holter monitoring (24 hour ECG monitoring, but it would detect arrhythmia only if it happened during this 24 hour period) or you can buy simple single lead ECG devices, which would help to monitor your rhythm whenever you are symptomatic. So, basically we need an ECG rhythm during symptoms so as to reliably rule out possibility of cardiac arrhythmia. In a nutshell, your ECG is fine and may need further steps. I would also like to know why are you eliquis, Prednisone. And thyroid problems may cause arrhythmia like atrial fibrillation, so TSH should be monitored."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have by-pass surgery done.

After two hours of lunch FBL was 173 and urine: no sugar detected and HbA1c comes as 9.1 %. Before eight months there was no sugar detected in the reports and now it is like this. Need your advice for this. Fasting seems to be big value. How fasting is more impacted than PP? How severe is this? Can it be controlled only via diet and exercise?First pregnancy we had stillbirth. There was no sugar detected till ninth month of pregnancy. Till start of ninth month, sugar reports were fine but still we had stillbirth. She was detected with gestational diabetes which came to normal within 15 days after delivery. After one and half year we again had pregnancy and we have little girl of 3.6 years old now. During second pregnancy she does not show symbol of sugar but to avoid risk we opted for C-section at the start of ninth month itself.","Doctor":"Hello. This is very possible. Ladies who develop gestational diabetes are more prone to develop diabetes in the near future. It is like a warning sign to start healthy lifestyle measures so that you can avoid developing diabetes. Currently your wife is having diabetes and she will require medications. She will need to exercise and follow a strict diabetic diet along with the medicines. If she manages her diet and exercising well, she can get off the medications. But for now, she will need both.  So when the fasting sugar is high, that means the glucose produced by the liver for our organs (especially brain) during our sleep even when we do not eat, is uncontrolled.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

I had a sports injury and I packed on a lot of weight afterward. In total around 100 pounds. I felt fairly healthy at 6'1 280 pounds I was playing collegiate rugby. I decided to make a change in the last two weeks and I have completely cut out sweets, candy, soda, fast food, and junk for the most part. I have been eating once a day, midday a meal that consists of rice, fish, chicken, salad, and sweet potatoes. It would be around 800-1000 calories. I take around a 30 minutes walk that I have been building upon with light bodyweight exercise. Just going as I feel comfortable. So my question is do you think going from a 3000-4000 calorie a day diet and dropping to 1000 a day is too drastic? I am trying to cut a lot of weight I am hoping around 75 pounds in the next three months. I feel fine and it is not overly fatiguing. I take multivitamins and if I feel really hungry or have a sweet tooth I just have a spoon or two of peanut butter. When I started I was 388 pounds and today I weighed myself at 373. My water intake has been consistent as well. Just wondering if what I am trying to accomplish is attainable or realistic and if it is fine for my long term health. I feel like obesity is just as bad. Looking forward to your response.","Doctor":"Hello. Well, yes gradual loss of weight is always advisable for your health. It will be difficult but needs patience over time. You can continue with the amount of items taking but do jot skip any meal. Always have a natural source of multivitamins like fresh fruits or vegetables. Have some chicken slice vegetable salads which will include protein and vitamins. It can be taken as a wholesome meal per time. Exercising twice daily for at least 30 minutes is best. Treadmill walk or pilates or dance aerobics also helps in cutting out the weight. Never starve yourself. You can have juices of all kinds without sugar which will keep your stomach full. Water intake should be optimum but not over drinking. Diet and workout both will aid in maintaining a healthy weight. Meditation and good sleep contribute a lot in maintaining a good mental state."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am a 28-year-old female. Recently I went through dilated retinal examination.

The spot that you have mentioned is called a lattice which is basically an area of weakening in the retina. If you have no history of any retinal disease in other eye or in any family members then doctors usually observe your symptoms. They occur when this lattice converts into a break or about to convert into a break then we can seal it off with a laser. Till then you have to be in follow up and visit your ophthalmologist every six months or so. Refrain from doing chronic heavy lifting like going to the gym.

I had a routine 24 tape which was clear (ectopic beats picked up but were benign). I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks. However, they generally come on during stressful situations. Could this be a panic attack symptom? I also wanted to add that this happened during intercourse (I am a 35-year-old male, height is 174 cm and weight is 100 kg). I look forward to your response and suggestions.","Doctor":"Hello. This can be a cardiac arrhythmia like PSVT (paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia) or atrial fibrillation, in which heart rate suddenly goes up and also suddenly decreases. And one may get symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain or heaviness, dizziness, etc. Are you having ventricular or atrial ectopics? Have you undergone echo? Presence of ectopics also suggests the possibility of these arrhythmias. Usually, ECG is normal (attachment removed to protect patient identity) as it is done in between the episodes or may show ectopics. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You may request for portable cardiac monitor either Holter or another mobile-based rhythm monitor especially during intercourse to see the rhythm is recurring. Alternatively, you may undergo treadmill test and we can see if it recurs during the running.  Also, thyroid test should be done if not had recently. ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard. Next time, you have this, focus on heart rate and measure pulse rate. These arrhythmias are not life-threatening. So overall, that episode may be an episode atrial arrhythmia rather than panic attack and our priority is to confirm it by investigations.

My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have a retina problem in both the eyes. I had a laser surgery in both my eyes two years ago. It was repeated last year with three injections of Avastin and this year, the laser surgery was done only in the right eye. But, I cannot see very well. I see something like a black point. So, I got checked for ischemic eye stroke. I checked with two doctors in my city. The first said that there is a cataract in the right eye and that three injections Eylea, Ozurdex, and Accentrix had to be given, while the left eye is well. The second said that the cataract was in the beginning stage and no removal is required. Only an injection of Accentrix and two laser treatments would suffice. So, now I am confused. Please help me.

She is in a perimenopausal phase. She visited a gynecologist and went for a pelvic ultrasound. The reports show that she is having a small thin-walled hemorrhagic cyst with internal echoes in her right ovary and few sub centimetric nabothian cysts in her cervix. I am a bit worried if this hemorrhagic cyst is something to complex and could it turn out to be something cancerous? I am very much worried.","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen your attached report (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It would be better for me to have your mother's obstetrics, gynecological, medical, surgical and drug present and past history as I could be able to correlate symptoms. If she has been treated for any problem better to have a check on that and take regular treatment like diabetes, hypertension, etc. This perimenopausal age is very much prone to get disease due to aging. Mostly mood variations, night sweats, bone pains, all these symptoms near menopause. A woman should start taking extra care in advance near 40 years of age like calcium with vitamin D supplements, daily light exercise and walk, etc. Ovarian cyst multiloculated 5 cm or more without symptoms should have regular follow up ultrasound along with tumor marker investigations, etc., and an ovarian cyst with symptoms less than 5 cm even should be investigated. As medical and related drug history I do not know cyst with symptoms better to investigate with serum calcium 125 (antigenic tumor marker) and grey scale sonography. International multicentre research showed that cyst of 3 to 5 cm asymptomatic with normal calcium 125 have 0 % chances of malignancy. So, it is better to have serum calcium 125 done for her. Calcium 125 more than 65 U/ml has greater chances of malignancy. The hemorrhagic cyst should resolve by itself may be with minor pain. Observe for any abnormal symptoms like severe abdominal pain, abnormal bleeding report to the tertiary care center. It is better to have serum calcium 125 test and discuss here or with the local gynecologist. I hope things will be better. She should take care of all other physical problem nicely as diabetes, hypertension as many problems together also give complicated effects.

After a year, I had for the second time in my left. Later, BCVA in left became 9/10 and right 10/10. Now over a month, I am experiencing a blurry vision in the left with occasional headache and left eye pain. Three weeks ago, I had an eye examination and the left eye vision was 4/10 and right 9/10 not correcting both with glasses. My doctor informed me that there is a higher degree of corneal opacity in the left eye and less in the right. He also saw a coloring matter in the cornea. The RK, 4 incisions, were performed at the age of 16 and now I am 45. My doctor told me that my blurry vision is due to abnormal cornea and the only solution for my case is to try to fix the vision with contact lenses. The results were negative when I tried all kind of lenses such as scleral, soft, hard, etc., the left was only 6/10 and 9/10 right. My profession is an airline pilot, so I need the best results possible in order to continue flying. Now, my medical certificate is suspended.

I have gone through the pictures of your old records (attachment removed to protect patient identity). By your description, I understand you have some idea about your condition. It looks like irregular astigmatism. This might have developed due to weakening of cornea, which is common after radial keratotomy (RK). This causes distortion of the image like irregular lens.

I started having incontinence problems about 4 to 6 months ago (cause unknown). It began with issues only happening at night while sleeping. A month ago it had progressed to occasionally not even being able to make it to the bathroom before I began to pee. Then, about four weeks or so ago, while having sex with my girlfriend, I ended up with a fairly large cut or tear right underneath the head of the penis. It has happened before.About 2 to 3 weeks ago I somehow ended up with a UTI and yeast infection. For whatever reason, I have not taken it seriously (major depression) and two nights ago I started having pain (then ended up realizing these were little white ulcers that have since begun to spread rapidly). They are under the head of the penis, on my scrotum, and also on the shaft of my penis. Along with that, last night I realized the lymph node in my right groin was significantly swollen and painful as well. Today that became my lymph node in both my right and now my left groin as well.)Finally, when I woke up today I had a huge swollen ring of skin, underneath the head of my penis, along with everything else. I have had this same swollen ring one time before in my life. It is seriously swollen and more ulcers are on that skin as well. I did a bit of looking at pictures online and I found a condition that is very similar looking (as far as the swollen ring goes,) called paraphimosis. However, I have been circumcised since I was a baby. So I am not thinking that is it. Anyway, I am in fairly severe pain and I am worried about the lymph nodes in my groin (left and right) being swollen, that there is some bad infection spreading in my blood throughout my body. I guess I could be simply paranoid but I went from ignoring this to now freaking out. So I do not believe that this is the case. Please help. Any ideas or thoughts or suggestions?

Palpitations happen mostly when I am laying down. For six months I was good. There were no heart palpitations. One week ago, I was sleeping and I heard someone trying to open my apartment door and I was scared. My heart stopped and I told myself that now I am going to have heart palpitations again and yes now for one week I am having heart palpitations. I feel dizzy and tired. I had ECG done couple times and nothing was found. Is this something dangerous? Will I die from it? Can I work out even if I have heart palpitations? I am very scared that whether I have heart disease. One of my reports says sinus tachycardia, possible left atrial enlargement, nonspecific T-wave abnormality, and abnormal ECG. The other one done two months after says no abnormality. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand you are worried about your heart investigations. At-large there is nothing they found on later EKG (electrocardiography) report. And in both the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) heart markers troponin-I is normal and in range meaning, there was nothing abnormal found in the heart. In such a situation, cardiac investigation results are correlated by a cardiologist with the physical examination of the patient. This gives the whole picture of the heart. Sinus tachycardia means the heart is pumping at the normal pattern but at a fast pace. If there is increased heart rate due to some structural abnormality or conduction defects in the heart, it does not cause sinus tachycardia. In the later tests where you mentioned, they found nothing wrong, means there was no correlation between the symptoms you felt with the heart's health and there was all fine to go with. Otherwise, they must have gone for some medications or therapy for the heart to correct any defects. Possible left atrial enlargement, but they could not confirm that or at least it looks like from the data provided here in this query. Nonspecific T wave abnormality, they could not specify if there was the T-wave abnormality and that was linked to your health issues. If suspicious they may have gone for more investigations to rule out any issues. But they did not mean there was not much to explore and in the later evaluation, they found all fine. In such a situation and also because the reports are from long time ago, it is better to go back for a thorough heart evaluation. Your cardiologist may go for extensive heart studies including but not limited to physical examination, EKG, echocardiography, exercise stress test, cardiac markers, if needed, etc. For more information consult a cardiologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am a 32-year-old software engineer.

Contact lenses are not advisable for people having dry eyes. I recommend you to use spectacle only. Antiglare, blue cut glasses help you on computer screen work to some extent. It will help to relieve from UV light from LED lights. If dryness of eyes is severe, you need to avoid direct AC air on eyes and need to take eye drop medications. Regarding your eye drops, If Refresh Tear is not adequate, you can use them more frequently, example hourly one drop. Refresh gel is also available which has longer action but it gives sticky sensation, so I recommend to use gel during night time. You can also apply cold water wipes on eyes when you are on the computer and have eye strain.

Looking at the X-ray (attachment removed to protect patient identity) lateral view of both heels taken nearly six weeks from the injury there is still a gap visible at the fracture site and this will mean that the fracture is not fully united.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy.

I believe it is because of excessive yelling all the time due to some reasons. She went to an ENT three weeks before and that did not help even a bit and there were other side effects of gas, worsening of piles, and constipation. She has pain in her throat while even drinking water. Earlier she used to have these pain too because of excessive yelling but that got healed itself within a day or maximum two days but this time it has been a month. Also, the ENT we took her to said that it is an infection. And also my mom just told me that she experiences some very tiny ulcer kind of things inside the throat with her tongue which she cannot see in the mirror though. Please guide.","Doctor":"Hello. With the symptoms and the pictures you have sent (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it appears your mother has some laryngopharyngeal reflux with associated inflammation in the posterior larynx. This along with the yelling would have resulted in edema around the region along with pain. If you were to bring your mother to me I would suggest taking tablet Pan (Pantoprazole) 40 mg one tablet twice daily before meals for 15 days. Next, you should take syrup Gaviscon two tablespoon half an hour after each meal for 15 days. To relieve pain, she may take Dolo (Paracetamol and Hydrocodone) 650 mg one tablet once or twice daily as necessary. If she can pinpoint where she feels ulcer, she can apply Dologel CT gel over the area using clean fingers twice daily. If the ulcer is badly painful she can chew Lidocam (Benzoxonium chloride and Lidocaine) lozenges which relieve pain wonderfully. Initially, to remove inflammation I would also advise on taking Chymoral Forte (Diclofenac) tablet twice daily for five days. Looking at the pictures I do not feel there is an active infection that we should start her on an antibiotic. We shall observe her for three to four days and if the pain does not get relieved we can institute antibiotics for her. Secondly, she must follow some dietary restrictions as follows: If she has symptoms of foreign body feeling in throat or excessive mucus or nose block or post nasal drip we may have to add some more medicines. But for now, these medicines should suffice. Be in touch and write back to us and let us know how she fares. If there is anything more you wish to know from us do write back to us.

I just moved to a new area and found a new ophthalmologist, and he said my optic disc was smaller than normal, and he recommended a visual field test, to get a baseline, should it be needed for the future. I called my ophthalmologist for the previous two decades, and he said he never bothered to look at my optic disc. From what I can find on the internet, a field vision test is used to check the progression of glaucoma, among other things, but not to diagnose it. My new ophthalmologist gave a diagnosis of low tension glaucoma, stage unspecified. He did not start treating me for it. When I questioned the diagnosis, he explained that the visual field test is the only way to diagnose it. I hate testing for the sake of testing. I am finding some articles on the internet that support the idea that a field vision test can be overused and a waste of time for a variety of reasons, including the management of glaucoma. My peripheral vision, as best I can tell is fine. I can certainly look straight ahead, cover one eye and see an object at 90 degrees. The doctor did no vision testing in his office. He only saw what he thought was a smaller than normal optic disc. He admitted this could be perfectly normal for me. My manual and online computer tests show no loss of peripheral vision. Do I really need this test?","Doctor":"Hello. The spectrum of the disc and the cup size is hugely variable in people. The size of the optic disc is not the only determining factor. The size of the cup, average rim size and pattern, nerve fiber pattern, and intraocular pressure, are together taken into consideration before conclusively making a diagnosis of glaucoma.

Shortly after, it became painful, primarily when touched or biting. I can also feel some throbbing from the root or gum. Today it is still painful. I am not sure what I could have done, I always brush the area twice a day so I would be surprised if there were decay. I have minor gum recession above the tooth in question. I also had panoramic and 3D X-rays taken a couple of weeks ago for my wisdom teeth, and the images did not display anything unusual going on in the front teeth. I have not bitten anything hard or consciously done any damage to it. What could be going on? Is this just temporary pain or sensitivity?","Doctor":"Hi. The sensitivity could be due to tooth abrasion. But pain indicates a pulpal or a periodontal pathology (pain due to decay tooth or problem with the gums involving the tooth). An X-ray could probably be of good help in such a situation. Maybe, you had a hit to the tooth previously (even a few years back) it could suddenly cause pain. Or it could be gum recession or any food stuck between the tooth and the gum. It could be trauma from occlusion (a condition in which the affected tooth is damaged due to continuing hard contact with the opposing tooth of the lower jaw when clenching the teeth). So the cause of the pain must be diagnosed to come up with a treatment plan. If it is due to the hard bite, occlusal correction should be enough. If it is sensitivity and gum recession, a deep scaling and/or a local flap surgery procedure should be done. If it is pain due to tooth decay or X-ray suggests a periapical problem, root canal therapy (RCT) should be done. Management depends on the cause of the problem.

To summarize, in my opinion, you are glaucoma suspect. If you have any family history of glaucoma, then I will start treatment for glaucoma. But if there is no family history of glaucoma, then I would like to wait and keep you under observation. I would like to get all tests repeated after six months for initial 3 to 4 times, and if findings are consistent and non-progressive, then we can reduce the follow-up to yearly once.

Also, they mentioned that it is in the advanced stage and severe of around 90%. From another couple of tests, they found that my mother needs cataract surgery along with glaucoma. Upon asking about the remedies, doctors told that surgery could prevent from damaging further, but it will not help in recovering the eye power. I need some help to understand the best possible way to cure or prevent further vision loss. Can glaucoma and cataract get treated at the same time? Is that advisable? I have attached a recent report for your consideration. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. I reviewed all reports carefully (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your doctor has correctly said that it is an advanced form of glaucoma. The treatment depends on the type of glaucoma, either open-angle glaucoma or closed angle glaucoma. It is diagnosed by doing gonioscopy. Yes, both cataract and glaucoma can be operated at the same time and same sitting. There is nothing wrong. The treatment is aimed at preventing further damage. Otherwise, recovery is not possible. Overall, your treatment is in the correct direction.

According to your statement, she has been suffering from breathlessness for one month and it becomes worsen while she is lying. Sudden breathlessness can occur in asthma, heart failure, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, psychogenic problems like anxiety, etc. At first, we should find out the cause for which she is suffering now. In case of nocturnal asthma, patient suffer from breathlessness, chest tightness, etc., more at night. But you do not mention if she had past history of asthma, allergic rhinitis or repeated respiratory tract infections. Again we do not know about her physical structure like lean and thin or healthy, her occupational history, environmental history like living status, cooking history, history of fever or sudden weight loss history or hypertension history or is there any added sound with her shortness of breath. You did not mention, is there any swelling in her ankle or face or any parts of the body? Her nature of breathlessness is constant or not, that means is she suffering more at night than day? Become weak or breathless after light exercise? Is her chest movement is restricted or not? If she is obese then she can be suffered from obstructive sleep apnea. She should undergo CXR, pulse oxymetry, ECG, monitoring blood pressure, etc. For her breathlessness, she should be placed on propped up position during her sleeping time along. By using nebulization with salbutamol solution (Saltolin) along with inhaler Azmasol (two puffs four times a day) and Inhaler Iprasol (two puffs two times a day) with weight reduction and BP monitoring she can get some relief."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I saw your picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity), need some more clear pictures. By the picture, it is a simple melanocytic naevus. No need to worry. Keep it under observation for every six months by taking a photograph and comparing it.  It is very very rare for your skin type for a mole to convert into dysplastic (cancerous) mole.

Why do I need to remove glasses for reading? Would single lens solve the problem?","Doctor":"Hi. If you were wearing glasses for near and now you do not need glasses for near, then that means you are getting index myopia due to changes in your natural lenses. That is an early sign of cataract changes that you can see without near glasses and it is called second vision. As you are 70 years old, there must be some early cataract changes. If you are fine with glasses for distant vision, then it is fine until your vision is further deteriorated.

In case your girl is malnourished or low in weight or there is any other systemic condition associated, the situation might differ. I think you need to visit a dentist and get an X-ray IOPAR done to know the proper situation. So visit a dentist as soon as possible and get the proper information of the cause.

It pains sometimes but the pain has no specific trigger. She also complains of seeing multiple floaters blocking her vision. There is a remarkable improvement in her near sight. She is able to read without using glasses. But the far sight is not clear. As per her, it is worst than her earlier vision before the treatment. Kindly advise what should be our next steps. Also, is the treatment going in the right direction?","Doctor":"Hello. Sometimes, complications happen in cataract surgery also. It is mentioned in the medical literature that there is zonular dialysis this makes a little tricky surgery. This makes lens weak and there are chances of particles of lens going back towards the retina. But this is completely treatable and I did it in many patients and seen in many patients doing fine. It is like you are driving and anything can happen at any time. Now, the irritation and pain are a superficial problem and is related to the surface and also could be because of sutures which were used during retina surgery. This will be fine for a period of time and I will be prescribing medicines. Little vision will be compromised but the good thing is that her near vision is fine. Distance vision will take time like four to six weeks and will not be normal as the other eye. The treatment is going right. So do not worry.

I am not sure if this is scarring or healing tissue or if it is an infection.","Doctor":"Hi. Firstly, I would like to appreciate you for the clearest picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity) you have attached to your complaint. Next, my question would be how long has it been since you got the wisdom tooth removed and did you visit back your dentist after seven days for suture removal in that area? As far as I have noticed in the picture you have sent, the region seems to be good and healing. The yellow substance stuck mostly looks like food debris locked around the socket (sometimes it could be the debris swirled around the suture thread in case if it is removed by now). Try gargling with warm salt water to get rid of it. Vigorous gargling is not advisable when it is less than three days since you got it extracted. If you are unsuccessful in this, then I reckon you visit the dentist back for a review and get a saline flush in that region or the dentist would manually remove the debris with a tweezer without affecting the healing gums.

Yesterday, I was dealing with patients post them having cosmetic injectables. There was pinpoint blood from the needle insertion points. I am thinking the worst case scenario and not saying this happened, but my mind is playing with me - what would happen if I then applied makeup to that person with a brush and double dipped into the color without sterilizing, then used the brush again on another person and so on? Could that contract an infectious disease? I am worried sick.","Doctor":"Hello. Our main concern here is regarding the transmission of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), hepatitis B and C. Now, in the scenario you are explaining, it is less likely for any virus or infectious disease to transmit to other, but small risk of transmission remains. There are two reasons. Considering you are applying makeup on intact skin, so in that case, it is unlikely for any infection to transmit. Secondly, if you are applying it on the skin where you have given injections, then a small possible risk is there, but risk is further reduced by the deactivation of viruses by colors. So overall, there is a minute risk may be less than 0.1 percent, which is really small. So, I think you should stop worrying about it and use a separate container from next time.

It has been seven months after eye laser and I have been great, no more flashing lights for few months and no vision problems.","Doctor":"Hi. I, unfortunately, have to say no. The fact that you have had a retinal tear which had to be treated by laser tells me that you are at future risk of another tear. The tear by itself can progress to retinal detachment and can permanently decrease the visual acuity of your eye even after treatment. Please avoid all contact sports and attend follow-ups as instructed by your ophthalmologist. Anomalous PVD (posterior vitreous detachment). 1. Indirect ophthalmoscopy. 2. B-scan ultrasound. 1. Retinal hole. 2. Retinal degeneration. Retinal tear post laser. Observation. Avoid contact sports.
