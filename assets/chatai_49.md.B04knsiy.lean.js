So the chance of pregnancy is negligible but can't be denied . Post coital  bleeding is found in many conditions ( even after long gap of active stage but not for longer duration ).  So in my opinion wait till your menses to come even 1 week later to probale date if it doesn't comes then confirm pregnancy with UPT But prior to that you need to get reviewed in gynecology clinic for post coital bleed n probably require a PAP'S Smear with Per vaginal examination .

I was wondering if you could advise me on what to do or if you know what it may be?","Doctor":"Hello,Itchy bumps on scrotum may be due to acne or warts or boils or sebecious cysts etc. Until examination is done it is difficult to say what it is. If pus is coming then you may use antibiotics like amoxicillin and clavulinic acid 625mg twice a day for five days.

I have done 4 home pregnancy tests and they all came out negative.Please help I am worried","Doctor":"Hi, I had gone through your query and understand your concerns.This is a common problem experienced by women taking birth control pills.Wat you are taking is a combined pill(levonorgesterl and ethinylestradiol) which contain both oestrogen and progesterone.It will take 90 days(3 months) to restore your normal ovulation and periods,once you stop the pills.So hopefully you will have ovulation by mid March and bleeding by last weeks of march.And be warned that this can vary from person to person.So don't do unprotected Sexual intercourse,as you can still become pregnant these days,if sperm reach your uterus.Hope this answers your query. If you have additional questions or follow up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions.

Plan B is effective irrespective of the stage of the cycle. it does not only work by inhibiting ovulation  but also causes bad conditions in the uterus making implantation difficult. There is nothing else to be done and you should not be worried. Also, talk to your doctor about adopting and using a regular method of contraception as well as always protecting yourself during intercourse because it also helps guard against STDs.I hope this addresses your query fully.

I've ordered the morning after pill to collect tonight but should I be worried & when should I start taking my normal pill again straight away?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for the query. The chances of pregnancy are directly proportional to the delay in starting the new pack, greater the delay higher the chances and so on. However the chances of pregnancy from single act of unprotected contact are not so high. It is a good move to take the morning after pill. You may begin the new pack of regular pills the next day after you take the morning after pill. You will need additional protection for 7 days [condoms or any other] after starting the new pack. Also your period may be a bit irregular as the morning after pill and tablets have been started in the middle of the cycle. Hope this satisfies your query.

If the shell does not dissolve the drug does not get released. There must be some problem with insertion. Try wetting the tablet with clean water before insertion. Insert preferably at night after passing urine. Insert as high as possible. Do not get scared while doing this, there is no trauma to the baby, the cervix is normally closed so tablet does not go inside the uterus. Remain in the lying down position for 2-3 hours after insertion. With this method it should not come out. Hope this satisfies your query.

I used to have marvelon but since it was not available i had cerazette.last pill was last monday.no period yet until now. Just had unprotected sex today. But same time i had started taking marvelon.will i get pregnant? Can i continue taking marvelon for a week and stop to have my period?","Doctor":"Hi, welcome to health care magic.Cerazette and marvelon both contain the same drugs. However marvelon contains estrogen in addition to the desogestrel in cerazette. If the pills have been taken regularly as prescribed then chances of pregnancy are not there. The date of the sexual episode is not clear. Was it 5 days after stopping cerazette or 9-10 days. If you had unprotected sex about 3-5 days after completing cerazette, chances of pregnancy are very low almost zero. If it is after 9-10 days chances are higher but not very high. The risks are mostly theoretical, it happens rarely in actual practice as it is just the beginning of fertile period. It is better to use Plan B in such situations if you want to be absolutely sure.Absence of period is common with cerazette so that is not a cause of concern. I suggest that if sexual contact occurred more than 9-10 days after stopping cerazette, take plan B to be very sure. Hope this satisfies your query.

I consulted my doctor and she gave me injections to stop the bleeding and bleeding stoooed in 4 days after the injections...As concerned, my menses should start by 11 or 12th of this month..but it did not start til now...is it a serious issue?? Pregnancy test were negative twice..","Doctor":"Hi, Please do not worry. Just check if the pregnancy tests were done after the missed period or before it, as those done before missed periods will be most likely negative. If the test was negative after 7 days or more from the missed period, you are not likely to be pregnant. In that case the absence of period is due to I pill and injection that sometimes delays periods. Just wait for your periods after this. If you have not taken a test 7 days after the missed period, get it done using the first morning sample of urine for best results and rule out pregnancy. Also stress delays periods so relax, you have done everything possible and so are most likely safe.Hope this helped. Feel free to ask any more questions that you may have.

It seems that you are most likely having an infection. The symptoms are not due to I pill. The pain during urinating may indicate a urine infection that occurs after first sexual episode [honey moon cystitis is the medical term].

Belara contains a slightly higher dose of estrogen and a different progesterone that claims lower side effects.  I would consider that the estrogen in birth control pills carries more inherent risk that any of the different progesterones, and given that Yasmin contains less estrogen, it is actually probably safer.

We were in contact on 10,11,12,13, 16, 18 and 20th days after my period.... still 4 days are there to get my period....can you suggest me","Doctor":"Hi, and thanks for using HCM.Your question is a bit unclear. From what I understand it seems that you are expecting your period after 4 days and want to know about your status, but the heading says how may I conceive with I pill. I will try to answer it to the best of my ability. First about: How to conceive with I pill: I pill is used to prevent pregnancy. Use of I pill may sometimes cause irregular bleeding in the next menstrual cycle, so it will be difficult to predict ovulation in that cycle. But usually this gets corrected in one or two cycles. Regarding if you are pregnant or not: It is difficult to comment about this so early on. The earliest test that would be positive now is a blood HCG test, another is the urine pregnancy test positive 7 days after missed period. So I suggest that you do these tests. Also pregnancy may not occur within 1-2 months of regular sexual contact as it is very difficult to predict ovulation. You may use ovulation predicting kits or a basal body temperature chart to detect ovulation. Hope this was helpful. Thanks for using HCM.Feel free to ask any more questions that you may have.

I pill taken within 72 hours of sex is effective. The sooner you take i-pill, the more effective it is. i-pill is 95% effective within 24 hours of unprotected sex, 85% between 25-48 hours and 58% if taken between 49-72 hours, so their may be chances of pregnancy. Nausea, vomiting and headache are some common side effects after taking i-pill. You might also have some lower abdominal pain or find your breasts more tender than usual. All this should stop within a day or two. You are having these side effects and it will subside. It might also cause your next period to come early or later than normal. But if your periods are delayed by more than a week, you should go in for a pregnancy test and contact your doctor.

It would help to know the type of IUD, if it was a copper containing IUD or a hormone containing IUD. Some IUD's contain hormone and cause irregular periods. Pregnancy is not likely in your case as the insertion was done on day 5 and IUD's are very effective in preventing pregnancies. The urine test was also done on day 7 after the missed period so pregnancy is unlikely. I suggest that you check which IUD has been inserted. If it contains hormones like progesterone, then do not worry as it may cause irregular periods. If it is a non hormonal IUD, then you need to see your gynecologist for probable causes which are mostly due to imbalance in hormones. Hope I was able to help you. Thanks for using Health Care Magic.

These are all like pregnancy symptoms, I know that with the implant these are some of the side effects but I was 16 days late for my period and when I got it its only spotting like very very faint pink to the point where you can only just see it. The only reason I am concerned is I have rea. In so many places about ladies falling pregnant on the implant or having an ectopic pregnancy, I did not have a pregnancy test before incertion as they didn't ask me to perform one I also had finished my period for a week before it got inverted. Myself and my partner where sexually active before the implant was placed and we have had a couple of incidents before I got it put in but never thought anything of it. Is this just me being worried and concerned or what's happening to my body?","Doctor":"Hi, I understand your concern. The chances of pregnancy are there as the timing of insertion was late. Also if it is inserted late, a backup contraceptive method is advised for next 7 days as it takes 7 days to begin functioning. So this is unfortunate. However  in midcycle there is no way to confirm pregnancy. Having said all this, I want to inform you that symptoms similar to pregnancy may occur with implanon too. So the best way out now is to get a urine test for pregnancy. If it is negative, these symptoms are more likely due to Implanon. In that case they tend to settle in a few months. If urine test is positive an ultrasound will be needed to confirm the location of pregnancy. So get a pregnancy test done and decide future plan according to the results. Hope I was able to help you. Thanks for using Health Care Magic. I would be happy to answer any further queries.

So i already finish my 1st pack but my monthly period has not come..? so ill take another one pack until now. My last period is on jan. 6,2014. So i expect my period comes at first week of february. Base on the intruction skip to take 1 week. I didnt do that for sure im not getting pregnant.. before im using trust pills 28 tablet but this micropil its only 21 tablet. Pls help me.. thank you.","Doctor":"Hi, I went through your query. The periods that you have while on micropill is actually withdrawal bleeding. This means your periods can occur normally only if you withdraw the hormones you have been taking i.e. stop your micropill after 21 days. And stopping the micropill after 21 days will not make you pregnant as you will not ovulate i.e. egg will not be produced. I would advise you to stop your micropill for a week and continue after a week. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I have a question. I'm on the birth control shot, Depo, February 25th will be my third shot. I just recently been put on an antibiotic, \\"Doxycycline\\" for a UTI. 500mg, twice a day.

This month I had my period the week before last, 7 days as normal.  Then a little bit of spotting all last week.  Today my period started again.  Is this something I should be concerned with?  I do not understand why I keep having spotting and periods.  Thank you for your time.  Cheryl Bowley","Doctor":"Heavy or frequent bleeding can be a side effect of the paraguard, though most women don't have the problem.  You have several options, and you will really need to speak with doctor about your options.  First, you will need to make sure there is no other problem causing the bleeding, such as a fibroid, a polyp, or an infection.  If it is determined by your doctor that the paraguard is the likely culprit, you can choose to remove it and try another form of birth control, such as pills or even the Mirena IUD (which usually controls the bleeding much better), or you can choose to try some pills with the paraguard in place just to control the bleeding for a few months, and then stop and see if the bleeding returns.  You should discuss all of this with your doctor and decide what is right for you.  I hope this answers your question.  Please let me know if you have any more questions."},{"Patient":"I have been taking Ortho tri-Cyclen lo before and I am switching to Spintec.  I just finished all the pills from Ortho tri-cyclen and I just finished my period.  Which pills am I supposed to take from Sprintec?  I feel like if I start the first pill, I will start the period again.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for choosing HCM.I suppose you are using a 28 days pack. If you check the pack there will be 21 pills of one color [usually blue]  and 7 pills of another color [usually white]. The 21 pills of the same color are active pills and the 7 pills are sugar pills. You must begin with the active pills. You will not start the period again as long as you take the active pills. Since you have finished your period, a backup method of contraception like condoms is advisable during the first 7 days of using the pack. After that you can use them every 28 days without the need of any additional contraception. Hope I was able to help you. Thanks for using Health Care Magic.

I usually have minor cramps 1-2 days before starting and then not at all throughout my cycle. This time however, I had no cramps prior to starting but have had severe cramps all the days of my cycle. I've also been experiencing nausea for about 5 days but only for a few hours a day on an intermediate level so I don't know if its associated with the pill or perhaps a stomach bug. Is this normal with this birth control? I took a pregnancy test because I've heard of women bleeding and cramping even when pregnant in the early weeks but it came out negative.","Doctor":"Pills are almost 100% effective if you take them everyday at the about the same time and rarely miss a pill (double up if you miss and use back up if you miss more than once). it doesn't matter if you don't have. If you pleader regularly or if you spot. They are still that effective if taken correctly.  Usually women on the pill have less cramps than women who don't take the pill because bleeding I s usually much lighter. It does however take a few months for your body to adjust to the changes caused by the pill. If you are continuing to have severe cramps through the next couple cycles it will be time to be evaluated for some other things that can cause pain such as an infection. I hope this information helps. The nausea should also decrease over time. If it continues you might want to try changing when you take your pill. Sometimes it's better to take it with a little food."},{"Patient":"I am 16 years old.. I made a mistake and had sex with a boy I hardly knew.

I hope your practitioner or doctor warned yo that irregular bleeding can indeed be a side effect of the implant.  Sometimes it resolves over time, but after a year it is unlikely to improve further.  It is important to make sure you do not have an infection and your pap smear is normal.

Many women either have light irregular bleeding or no menses while using depo.  It can take six months to a year for a normal cycle to resume, but it is out of your system completely by a year.  Your irregular/absent menses has another cause such as chronic absent ovulation due to a like of cycling in your hormones.  It is important to have the reason looked in to.

Taking one day gap between pill packs may not lead to major difference in hormonal effect. As you are taking the pills for 5 months, hormones might have been in lower levels.

Can I take another dose of postinor 2 cause i had unprotected sex on 8 of sept. Wat do I do.","Doctor":"Hi there,Thanks for your query.Firstly, Postinor was introduced in the market for use ONLY in emergency cases and NOT for routine use. It contains very high doses of a female hormone called Progesterone, which- when taken- deregulates the natural cycle of hormonal changes in the body. Hence, it's NOT RECOMMENDED to take another dose.The safest way to avoid pregnancy is to take either, conventional contraceptive pills; or, have an IUD inserted inside the uterus. But, get a pregnancy test done before you decide on taking regular contraceptive pills.Consult your doctor and apprise him of my opinion. I am certain that he will agree with me and guide you accordingly, depending your personal preference.If you find my response helpful and informative, do not forget an “excellent” (5-star rating)  to my answer, to ENCOURAGE ALL doctors- engaged in social service- to render sound advice to the FREE queries.

You need to talk with your doctor about another contraceptive in order to prevent pregnancy.  You should ask your doctor if he can start you on a birth control pill that will both control your periods, AND provide protection from pregnancy.  I hope this helps answer your question, please let me know if you have any more questions."},{"Patient":"I m on implanon and haven t had my period in a year. Out of nowhere, I got cramps and the next morning woke up with bleeding. Also, I ve been taking topamax which I know decreases the effect of the birth control, what are the chances I could get pregnant?","Doctor":"Topamax should not decrease the effect of the implanon, though it could decrease the effect of birth control pills.  Also, some people may have an irregular period on the Implanon, even if you have went for a long time without a period.  As long as it is not very long or very heavy you don't need to worry about the bleeding.

However, your periods should return to normal within three months of removing the implant.  If they don't, you should call your doctor.

I had sex a few times but my boyfriend pulled out before he did anything and most of the time we used condoms. Then i got my period and it has lasted about 2 weeks and during this time we had sex but again he pulled out. The bleeding has ranged from heavy and red to light and brown.. Now that I am back home I have started the 4 day break and it has been 2 days and i still only have brown discharge. Is it quite unlikely that I could be pregnant due to the fact i took the pill correctly (usually on time but if not only about an hour late) and that he never came inside me? Ive read that the 2 weeks of bleeding can be due to hormones changing from change of lifestyle and things (like being overseas) and also that the body is getting used to the pill, is this correct? I have a habit of overthinking things and stressing myself out so it would be helpful to have a second opinion thank you.","Doctor":"I think you are right that you are stressing yourself out needlessly.  The fact that you were taking the pills properly is quite reliable in preventing pregnancy.  The fact that he pulled out might help a little too, but that doesn't work very well to prevent pregnancy.  Some people may have a little bit of discharge during the pill free time, but as long as it is not too bothersome, you don't need to worry about it.  It is also true that travel and life changes can affect your cycles."},{"Patient":"I had my period from the 9th to 12 October. I took Postinor 2 on the 15th.

Since you had a period on 30, you should have started the new pack of pills from day 3 of the periods. You started it a little late. So it was advisable to use a backup contraceptive method like condoms during the first 7 days. Day 12 of the cycle cannot be considered a safe day so chance of pregnancy are not very high but not zero. Also since you have been using norifam, the return to fertility after the drug is also delayed in some cases and protect against pregnancy. But there is no way to be absolutely sure. If it is less than 72 hours since intercourse, you can try plan B and continue your pills. This will reduce the chances of pregnancy significantly and you need not worry then.Hope this was helpful.

(this is what i used to take) There is a list of free meds I can take through my cigna plan and I tried switching to Junel back in August and that is not going well, as I have been bleeding/ spotting for almost a month now. I saw my DR today and she wrote me a script for zovia. I just read a bunch of reviews about how it s very common for women to have mood swings, weight gain and breast enlargement. I had a breast reduction a few years ago and the last thing I want is for them to get larger again. Also, I take my pills continuously so that I don t get my period, this is to avoid migraines. I know I can just ask my Dr, but I feel like I m being a huge pain because I keep calling there and asking questions. Here s the link to the free meds to choose from WWW.WWWW.WW","Doctor":"Hi, I understand your problem. It is unfortunate that loestrin Fe has been discontinued so you have to switch to another pill. The new pill Junel contains the same drugs that were in loestrin except the \\"Fe\\" part which is simple iron. This iron is used only to act as a supplement to increase our hemoglobin and is not an actual birth control ingredient. So please stop thinking that Junel and loestrin are different.The spotting is not because of junel. It is happening because the birth control pills are designed in such a fashion that active drugs are delivered for 21 days [if the pack contains 30 pills or 28 pills] and the rest of the days only simple vitamins or iron is given. In a 21 days pack, all pills are active and a women is supposed to stop for 7 days before starting the new pack. Every women is supposed to experience menses during the days of the inactive pills or when she is off pills. You have taken the pills continuously. So you have not allowed the normal menstrual blood accumulated in the uterus to come out. So it is coming out in the form of spotting which is not a good sign.The breast enlargement with the pills is not much and usually cyclical that is happens in few days of the cycle. I suggest that you must complete the current pack and than if it is a 21 days pack stop for 7 days. Let the menses come. Continue taking the pack as prescribed only and not in a continuous fashion. If you are worried about migraine, you can try using depot shots, but they tend to cause spotting and irregular bleeding. Other methods are a device system called mirena that is inserted inside the uterus for 5 years. Hope this was helpful.Thanks for using HCM. Have a good day.

The oestrogen is the hormone which can cause embolism and is to be totally avoided by your girlfriend. Progesterone is safer for her. Their are progesterone only pill available which provide regular contraception. Plan B is a emergency contraceptive which is taken after unsafe sex.

Well I missed several doses and had unprotected sex, so I took Plan B, and now I am resuming my birth control as normal. My question is, will I have to wait till I get to the sugar pills to see if I had a period and to know it worked? Because I heard Plan B works by kind of flushing out your system, but if my BC is preventing periods, will it still work? Thank you! :(","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for the query.Since you have used Birth control pills irregularly and also used plan B, it is difficult to predict when you will have a period. Even with this, in most cases, for women using birth control pills, periods will come only after the active pills are over despite using plan B in the middle of the cycle. Plan B works in more than 90% cases if taken properly. Concomitant use of both does not decrease the efficacy of plan B and it still works. It works by delaying ovulation and changing the lining of the uterus to prevent pregnancy from occurring. It does not work if pregnancy has already occurred. The best way to know if you are pregnant in this case would be to take a pregnancy test at least 3-3 1/2 week after using plan B using a morning urine sample. If it is negative, chances of pregnancy resulting from the sexual act on that day [before you took plan B] are negligible. Another way to know is wait for your period while taking the sugar pills, if it is delayed a pregnancy test 7 days after the missed period will help.

In your case there was no need of emergency pill. Because usually in case of regular periods ovulation will not occur one week before expected date of periods or during periods. Emergency pill will have high dose of hormone. That may be responsible for stopping of your bleeding after taking pill.Once the hormonal effect decreased the collected blood might have came out.

From that point of view, you should prefer triphasic pills or quadraphasic pills ( Not available in all countries). Make sure that you follow the instruction properly, do not skip a single tablet and start your next pack exactly as instructed by your doctor. These quadraphasic and triphasic pills contain less estrogen and quantity of estrogen varies with the days of the period, t minimize the side effects of estrogen while not affecting the efficacy. Do not take any pills continously for more than two years.hope you got your answer.Dr H Hamdani"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have been on cerazette for 3 years, this week i have taken my pill late about 3 or 4 times (always took it first thing in the morning when i realised). since friday I have found dark blood when i wipe.

Stimulation of penis during sexual intercourse keeps it erect. Condom causes decreased sensation and hence can lead to loss of erection. In addition post child birth the vaginal canal gets lax which further reduces the sensation.

Otherwise I don t get periods at all. Also, would like to know if any recreational drugs reduce the effectiveness or cause any bad side effects. Thank you","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for the query. Implanon can lead to side effects like intermenstrual sporting, breakthrough bleeding etc. So, the spotting you had could be due to that.Stress and strain due to exsms can affect the hormonal levels. That can lead to spotting. Possibly it will subside soon. If persists you can go for symptomatic treatment with antifibrinolytic drugs or additional dose of hormones with your doctor's advice. Recreational drugs may not directly affect the function of the birth control pills. But sometimes they can affect the metabolism of the pills and that can lead to fluctuations in hormonal levels.

The possible causes for your brown discharge are :- Irregular intake of hormonal pills can lead to withdrawal bleeding. -Presence of local causes like cervical erosion, polyps etc. -If you missed one pill completely, there is possibility of pregnancy, miscarriage etc. So, observe the discharge. If it subsides soon, no need to worry. If it persists or repeats, better to consult gynecologist once and get evaluated.

If you took the tablets as per the guidelines, the possibility of pregnancy is less. For more details :    If you took the missed pill within 24 hours, possibly complete protection can be expected. If you missed one pill completely and didn't use any additional method of contraception, then there is possibility of pregnancy. So, you wait for your withdrawal bleeding. If you do not get withdrawal bleeding even one week after completion of active pills, once go for urine pregnancy test. If the test comes negative, you can continue with your pills.

Hormonal pills can present with side effects like intermenstrual spotting, irregular bleeding etc. Usually they will subside soon without need of medication. So, possibly in next months you may not have the problem.

Please see your doctor and discuss removing the Implanon and replacing it with a new one, or switching to some other form of birth control."},{"Patient":"hi doctori am 28yrs old and hvg a one year old baby. nw i am planning for birth control methods and confused to choose one . i am scared f copper -T, if it may get miss place during intercourse due to force and movements. abt pills i am scared if it affect my or baby health since i am breast feeding. my gynec suggest me cerazette, but whn i checked net, it side effect is chance f breast cancer so i am scared. wht abt femilon? is it safe during breastfeeding? which is the safest?","Doctor":"Thank you for writing in HMC,if your breast feeding the safest drug for you is progsterone only pill/mini pill as suggested by your doctor. also you can have intramuscular depo injection and progesterone implants. all these have its own side effects which include irregular bleeding and amennorhea. acne, anxiety,dizziness,backache etc. risk of breast cancer is rare. this is the safest way for contraception in lactation, i would suggest the same. femilon is a combined OCP (has estrogen and progesterone) which is not given to lactating mothers."},{"Patient":"I went on continuous birth control (combined pill) around 4-5 months ago instead of taking the regular 21 day off 7 day style.  I still have breakthrough bleeding every month during when my period is supposed to be, but I just continue taking the pill and it eventually goes away.  But this last month, I had a period for 3 weeks.  I called my gynecologist and she said to stop taking the pills for 2 days and then get back on them and stay on them.  I stopped the pills for 2 days and had heavier bleeding.  I started the pills back up and have been on them since.  I asked her how long I had to use a second type of protection.  She said that they tell everyone 1 month, but that most doctors say 2 weeks.  She said to do a month because my body was all messed up and she didnt know where I was at in my cycle.  The thing is I am going to Mexico this weekend and next week and was looking forward to unprotected sex with my boyfriend.  So, I only didn't take the pills 2 days and that was just to have a real period.  I have been back on the pill for 11 days and will be back on it 14 by the time I have unprotected sex.  All the research I did stated I am safe after 7 days of taking the pill and shouldn't worry, but I wanted to know if that was true and why only 7 days.  What if I had ovulated?  Thank you so much for your help!","Doctor":"Thank you posting in HMC,first of all the pills you are having prevents pregnancy mainly by inhibiting ovulation. if you have the pill continuously your chance of getting pregnant is very less i.e 0.3%. however if you stop having the pill or miss the pill in between you have to have an extra protection like a condom. since you are on the pill since 14 days ,after which you are planning on unprotected intercourse, it is highly unlikely of getting pregnant. However to be on the safer side you can use a condom."},{"Patient":"Hi,Could you please explain the side effects of unwanted-72.

I want to to know why do I have these horrible cramps and only see light pink and brown blood when I wipe ?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for the query. As you have stopped birth control pills after two weeks, they might have led to withdrawal symptoms. Hormonal withdrawal can lead to bleeding. Expulsion of blood and endometrial tissue can lead to pain abdomen. Usually this pain will subside with antispasmodics. If you are having persistent pain even after taking the medicines, once check for presence of endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease etc. Consult gynecologist once, get examined and go for ultrasound. By doing ultrasound the possible cause for your problem can be identified and treated. In case of presence of infection, you may need one course of antibiotics. In case of endometriosis or adenomyosis etc you may need hormonal pills for few months.

As from your question i am not able to appreciate the exact number of days after which you had unprotected sex.So i am not able to tell you that there are chances of getting pregnant or not.

If you do not get your periods on time then go for a pregnancy test after 7 days of missing your periods because before this the test is not much confirmative.

So, the bleeding you got now could be withdrawal bleeding due to intake of emergency pill one week back. As now withdrawal bleeding started, the possibility of pregnancy is less. And no need to take emergency pill now. Repeated intake of emergency pills can increase the menstrual irregularity and also can affect fertility.

Better to consult gynecologist once and get evaluated. Go for ultrasound, thyroid profile and coagulation profile.Possibly with this workup the cause for your problem can be identified and treated. With your doctor's advice you can go for anti fibrinolytic drugs to control the bleeding. After investigations you can continue with your pills with your doctor's advice.

Intake of the pill within the stipulated time interval is enough protection to prevent any failure. Moreover, if you have had the intercourse during the safe period, you would be naturally protected.

I wasn't able to make a doctors appointment and fill my prescription because of my busy schedule. I am atleast 2 and a half weeks late. I think I might be pregnant because about two and a half weeks ago I spotted with about a table spoon or less of blood. My breasts and nipples got sore about two weeks ago, which usually happens right before my period but then the tenderness went away, and I only notice it now if I squeeze my breast or nipples. I took a home pregnancy test that turned out negative, and peed in a cup at the walk in clinic where they also told me it was negative, but gave me a referral for blood work.  Why else could my period be late? I also feel 10 times more bloated than usual. I'm 5'1 and 95 pounds so when I eat a lot of food I usually look really bloated, but now it's worse. I also have a weird fluttering sensation in my uterus which in my opinion feel like ticklish contractions? Like, my uterus feels like it's fluttering bigger and smaller every second for an hour, it comes and goes.","Doctor":"Hi, You are saying to discontinued taking Alesse 2 months ago and you are only 2 and half weeks late. As you had spotting in that time (due date), then, it could be period. It is common to have irregular periods after stopping Alesse or other contraceptive pills. To my opinion, this is exactly what is happening to you: irregular periods. The symptoms you are experiencing could be because of the upcoming periods. So, I'd suggest to see if your periods will be regular in a couple of months, then, schedule appointment with your OG specialist for further evaluation. If you want to rest sure at this time, you can measure HCG in the blood, which is more specific.All the best!Dr.Alba"},{"Patient":"Hi i was on depo for two years.

Two things are possible-    - It's menstrual irregularity after restarting the dose after a gap.    - During the gap you had conceived,started depo preparation while pregnant & started bleeding ( thretened abortion)-    The position can be judged by a physical examination by a Gynecologist/ Pelvic sonography & managed there after.

I would recommend you to use fusidic acid ointment on the effected area twice daily for 4 days until the cuts are healed. Meanwhile use good amount of lubrication during sexual intercourse to decrease the friction. Lastly, I would recommend you to get circumcision done because repeated cuts and injuries on foreskin will cause inflammation and fibrosis on the foreskin.

Normally this should follow a withdrawal bleeding, which you never had.     There is another possibility, of ovulation being recovered after withdrawal,You have history of regular sex in between. So possibility of late conception can not be ruled out. The pregnancy test you had done,might be too early to detect.    Please get your Blood HCG test done after a week more.( If there is no pregnancy, you may get late withdrawal bleeding )    Pelvic ultrasound scan  may help .

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. You have the classical symptoms of inguinal hernia where there is a defect in the wall of inguinal canal which causes the intestinal contents to come out of abdomen. This spread into scrotum when you stand for a long period of time or when you apply abdominal pressure. I would recommend you to visit the surgeon and get it operated because right now the hernia is reducible which means that it goes back when you push it but over the time the intestinal contents will get inflamed. Which may lead to obstructed hernia. This is a surgical emergency. Hope I have answered your query.

On November 7th me and my boyfriend broke a condom, about 2 hours after that I got plan B and took it. I had a period/bleeding on the 12th to the 15th and I was suppose to get my on schedule period on the 16th, and didn't get it. On the 19th, we had sex again and he pulled out but I'm not sure that nothing went inside; because I remember being told that sperm can escape before ejaculation. It's November 25th now. I've been having slight constant cramps, and my appetite is sort of messed up, as well as having the feeling I might throw up but never do.

I know I could be getting some implantation bleeding today or within the next 3 more days, but I just need some new imput as to whether or not I could be pregnant, or the chances thereof.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Taking plan B protects you from a single act of probable unprotected sex and not repeat acts on subsequent days. So there is a little possibility that the sex you had on 19th was not protected.Bleeding can occur early or late after taking Plan B because of high dose of hormones in most women and there can be irregular periods for next two cycles.Possibility of being pregnant is less likely but cannot be ruled out. Please do home pregnancy test at least 15 days after 19th November to confirm pregnancy.Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"I am on nuvaRing and recently had surgery with anesthesia, followed by taking meds including cephalexin , Demerol, tramadol, and ibuprofen.

If excess of the pills are taken, there may be no use but they may interfere with the effect of the first 2 doses.                       When pills are taken out of the shedule, the effect may be indefinite, and may depend upon so many factors.                       Still the posibility if getting pregnant in your case are very less.The day of the sex is in the safe period. The first 10days after the period are safe, because there wont be the release of the ovum to become pregnant.                        11th to 20 th day from the day of the period are unsafe, as during these days Ovum may be released on any day and ready for conception for 24 hours.                        21st to 30th day again safe, because ovum is not available.

If you have regularly been taking birth control pills then pregnancy is unlikely. It seems from your query that you are taking pills for 28 days of these 21 are active and 7 inactive pills. Periods usually start after 3-4 days of beginning of the inactive pills. I suggest that you check your pack of pills to see if they are 21 or 28. If it is a 21 days pack you need to stop pills for 7 days. You must repeat the pregnancy test after 7 -10 days. If it is negative and you use a 28 days pack, I suggest that you continue your pack for this month and see if the periods come during the inactive pills, if they do not come other causes of need to be ruled out. Check to see if you have been experiencing too much stress or have lost or gained weight. Also check to see if you have any discharge from the nipples as all these can cause absence of periods. There are certain other causes that need to be evaluated like thyroid problems or ovarian lumps. For this you will need to see a gynecologist. The weight gain may be due to the pills. The belly lump needs to be checked if it is due to fat deposition or due to an enlarged ovary. Your doctor will help you with this. Once again I think that the chances of pregnancy are low but if you continue to have absent periods, get yourself examined.

I am feeling nausea from a week n slight stomach pain in d upper side of stomach.","Doctor":"Hello user,If a young female had been practicing unprotected sex and is not getting any period, the first and foremost thing a Doctor will do is to have a Urine Pregnancy Test, I would also advise you to do the same.Also you are having nausea feeling, which is seen in pregnant females due to hormonal changes in blood.You are advised first to rule out diagnosis of pregnancy, if comes out to be negative then you have to search for other causes in your reproductive system, by consulting with a Gynecologist.You don't want to conceive and if at all your test come out to be positive, you are advised to have Medical Termination of pregnancy,according to your country's legislation.Hope my advise helped you.RegardsDr Hari Om ChandrakarMBBS"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctors, This is a question for a gynae . I am 27 years old.I have never had chidren.I am obese .I am 5 1 and weight about 260 pounds.My BMI is over 50.I had a copper IUD inserted about 5 months ago because the nurse told me that I should used other contraceptives because they have hormones and they may cause weight gain .I am already struggling to lose weight so I can t afford to add any more weight.Since the insertion ,my periods are heavier and longer with painful cramps.However this month seems to be more severe.I work i a remote area with basic health facilities and can only go home to my doctor one every month or two months.What do I do?What painkillers do i take?Should I have it removed?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for the query. Intra uterine contraceptive devices can present with side effects like intermenstrual spotting, prolonged bleeding, pain abdomen etc. But after few months these symptoms will subside soon. And the woman usually will get accustomed to the device. For more details :   possibly your symptoms may subside soon. If the bleeding persists, better to rule out other causes of menorrhagia like uterine fibroids, endometrial abnormalities, hormonal imbalance, thyroid abnormalities etc. If the IUCD is found to be the cause, with your doctor's advice you can take antispasmodics to decrease pain, anti - fibrinolytic drugs to control bleeding. If needed for few weeks you can use additional dose of hormones to control bleeding. If the bleeding still persist better to change the method of contraception. Take care."},{"Patient":"I m on implanon , I ve gotten tested to see if i was pregnant because i missed my period for 2 months ,first time the test could not be read so i went again and it came back negative then i got the implanon insertion . I ve been told i was going to spot but yet no bleeding what so ever, my stomach gets really tight when i walk a lot, or when i work out . could i possibly be pregnant ?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for the query. As your pregnancy test gave negative result, there is less possibility for pregnancy. Implanon can present with side effects like intermenstrual spotting, irregular periods etc. And some women may have amenorrhea also.It can also cause side effects like pain abdomen, cramps etc. So the symptoms you are having could be side effects of the implanon. If you still have doubt regarding pregnancy, consult gynecologist once and go for blood test for pregnancy. If the test comes negative, the possibility of pregnancy is very less. If the symptoms persist, go for ultrasound once. Ultrasound helps in ruling out pelvic inflammatory disease etc possible causes of pain abdomen and any abnormalities of the uterus can be ruled out. After ruling out these things, you can continue with implanon with symptomatic treatment. Take care."},{"Patient":"I have unregularly period because I have PCOS I had took birth control for 12 months but when I had stopped taking them my period was regular for just three months my 4th one is late now.. I  was wondering if I should take something else now ? and if the total fertility supplement PCOS will help in my case ? I will appreciate your kind answer I'm  really tired because of this ...thank you","Doctor":"Hi.Treatment for PCOS begins with weight loss and metformin, if either or both are indicated, and then is individualized depending on the patient's reproductive needs: oral contraception supplemented with antiandrogen therapy for patients not wishing to conceive or fertility treatments for patients desiring pregnancy.To reinforce weight reduction+/- metformin is the recommended therapy.Role of fertility supplements is questionable.Consult your obstetrician for further management.Hope this helps.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi.

I push it up as far as I can possibly get it. I even get in a bunch of different positions to make it go farther in, but it just keeps falling out! I was told I have a tilted uterus , can that be the reason it keeps falling out? And if not, please tell me a way I can keep it in.","Doctor":"Hi, I understand your concern and your problem. This may happen in the following scenarios. 1. The nuva ring is broken; sometimes the joint of the ring is broken so it may not regain back its desired shape once inside the vagina and slips out. In this case try a new ring.2. The vagina is lax and roomy. Sometimes vaginal laxity may interfere with holding the ring in place, this is very rare and unless the vagina is too lax, it does not slip.3. ring not pushed far enough; sometimes women do not push it far enough inside so that it remains at the vaginal opening and slips out. The first and third are common likely causes. Check to see if any of this is happening with you. If the ring is broken use a new one and use some other method like condom for next 7 days. If you are scared to push it in, I want to reassure you that don't be afraid. this ring is safe and will not go anywhere other than the vagina. It does not cause any trauma so it is safe. Just push it way inside so it will not slip. The best position to do this is lying down and slowly pushing it inside towards your buttocks that is backwards. A tilted uterus will not affect the position of the ring and neither will it have any effect on its insertion. Another word of caution is that if the ring has been lying outside for more than 3 hours, use another method like condom for the next seven days after correctly inserting the ring. Hope I was able to help you, Thank you for using HCM and have a nice day."},{"Patient":"good am to you my boyfriend and i have an interaction right after my period and at first he ejaculate then he insert his sex organ with out condom and at the second time he used condom and we are so paranoid to avoid pregnancy now, so he give me nordette pills (pfizer) and i take 3 pills there is a tendency to get pregnant? i hope u can help me","Doctor":"Dear patient,Thanks for the query.

Intra uterine contraceptive devices can present with symptoms like intermenstrual spotting, brownish discharge, abdominal pain etc.Usually these symptoms can be seen during the early weeks of insertion. But some women may have later also.And also women with IUCDs are more prone for pelvic infection. So when you consult your gynecologist this time,  go for pelvic examination, vaginal swab culture and sensitivity and ultrasound. By examination and these investigations the possibility of pelvic infection can be identified. If there are signs of pelvic infection, you need to take course of antibiotics. If there are no signs, symptomatic treatment may sufficient. And possibly the symptoms will subside soon.

As you took the contraceptive pills only for few weeks, there may not be any major change in the hormonal levels. But better to avoid the pregnancy in the month when you took the pills. Contraceptive pills can lead to irregularity in ovulation and menstrual cycles sometimes. Usually these will become regularize soon by their own. So better to wait one to two months for regularization of the cycles. Once your cycles become regularized, track your ovulation either with kit or with follicular study. And plan unprotected intercourse around that period. This will increase the possibility of pregnancy. Start taking folic acid supplementation from nowonwards.

While being on contraceptive pills, you will get only withdrawal bleeding instead of regular menstrual bleeding.

I forgot to take the pill for 2 days, and researched online as to what I should do, and I promptly took 2 pills that moment, and then 2 pills the following day, so that I had caught up.  I was in the first 7 days of that month's pill cycle.  3 days after this, I started bleeding.  I know bleeding or spotting can be normal in this situation.  But the bleeding is gone on now for nearly 2 weeks - not heavy flow, and sometimes it appears to stop, but essentially it has been on going for nearly 2 weeks.  I finished the month's pills on Monday of this week, so I am now on day 4 of taking no pill.  the bleeding hasn't stopped.  I have read that it is likely to stop on Monday when I take my first pill of the next cycle.  First question is do I need to be concerned about this?

Some amount of menstrual irregularity is common while being on intrauterine devices. Brown color of the blood indicates collected blood from the endometrium. Abdominal cramps,  bloating sensation etc can also be seen with intrauterine device. Possibly these will subside soon. If you are near your expected date of periods, this can be considered as withdrawal bleeding,  if not this could be intermenstrual spotting. If you are having any associated symptoms like white discharge etc, better to get examined once to rule out the possibility of pelvic infection. If the spotting persists,  you can take additional dose of hormones to control it with your doctor's advice.

I have gone through your question and from that I found that your concern is that you want to avoid pregnancy. You have planned to go for condoms and withdrawal method to keep you from getting preganant.From my clinical experience I can say that condom is a good option to prevent pregnancy as well as protect your self from other sexually transmitted diseases.  The other method which you want to use is withdrawal method, which is not very effective and safe. It is not only difficult to perform, but it's success chances are not very good. It can be done but when one has to practice it several times before you become accustomed. However, You are planning to go with the combination of condom and withdrawal technique which looks fine .The days you have chosen have lesser possibility of getting preganant, provided you have a normal and regular me natural cycle ( about which you have not mentioned anything).  However, no method is 100% safe, all methods have some failure rate. These measures are fine for doing sex sometimes, but of you shift to go for regular sexual relationship, I would advice you to consult a gynaecologist for better and safer options.Hope this answer helps you.Feel free to ask more questions regarding your health.Dr. Manisha Gopal"},{"Patient":"Lately I have been on a new birth control , however, as of last week I have light pink when I wipe, dry discharge in my underwear and also some itching and uncomfortability.

Oral contraceptive pills can cause side effects like intermenstrual spotting, brownish discharge etc. Nausea, bloating sensation etc can also be experienced with these pills. If you are having any associated symptoms like vaginal discharge etc, better to get examined to find out pelvic infection. If there are no signs of infection and the symptoms are due to pills only, you can go for symptomatic treatment. Possibly the symptoms will subside soon. If the brown discharge persists, you can go for additional dose of hormones for few days. This will help in decreasing the spotting.

Thank you Taryn","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for the query.Usually taking the pills at the same time every day can give complete protection. But as you took the missed pill within 24 hours, protection can be expected. Delay in intake of pill can lead to break through bleeding. That may be responsible for your spotting. Possibly this will subside soon. You wait till your expected date of withdrawal bleeding and if you miss the date, go for pregnancy test once. If the test comes negative, you can continue with the pills. You can go for low dose pills like overall length or ortho try cylen low etc. Low dose pills may not cause the side effects you are having. Take care."},{"Patient":"I am a 35 year old married male.

If you want to stop the pills in the middle of the month,  you have to use some additional contraceptive method till the completion of the month as you told. And possibly you may get the withdrawal bleeding earlier. But sometimes it is difficult to guess the time of onset of withdrawal bleeding because this can differ from cycle to cycle and person to person. So if you are having at least 7 to 10 days gap for your vacation,  you can stop the pills and wait for withdrawal bleeding. If the gap is short, better to continue the tablets. And after completion of the pack, if you want to avoid the withdrawal bleeding, continue the next pack without gap.This will prevent withdrawal bleeding and also give contraceptive benefit.

I would like to know if you think ol-ovrel 28 is good?","Doctor":"Hi, I understand your concern and congratulate you that you are so vigilant in choosing your drugs. Oral contraceptive pills are an excellent method of preventing pregnancy but all of them do have a few disadvantages. They all tend to increase the risk of blood clots but this happens more in elderly women, usually those that are debilitated or suffering from liver, heart or diseases of blood vessels. Drosperinone has been found to have a slightly higher risk of clotting than the other pills. Also, most of the newer pills do not cause hair growth but drosperinone itself decreases hair growth in women that have a high level of male sex hormones causing hair growth. If you do not have any such issue then any of both the drugs is a good choice. Regarding weight gain, this is unpredictable and depends upon ones own personal body composition and behavior as well as lifestyle factors like a sedentary lifestyle. If you feel concerned go ahead and use lo ovral. I hope I was able to help you.Have a nice day and thanks for using HCM!"},{"Patient":"I take my birth control pill at 10pm every night.

Just for extra info I also had a early termination at the beginning of August and I really haven't stopped bleeding since then,  I have also had 2 heavy periods since then.  Because of this I have become very tired and lethargic.","Doctor":"Hi, welcome to HCM.I have reviewed your case and there are two possible explanations.1. You have had an early termination of pregnancy and have still not stopped bleeding. This may be due to an incomplete abortion where a few bits remain inside the uterine cavity and they need to be removed. For this you will need to undergo an ultrasound examination. 2. Bleeding after insertion of copper t is not unusual and women usually have slight bleeding and the next few periods may be heavy. Since you have continuous heavy bleeding a misplaced copper t is another possibility. For this you must try to feel the thread. If you are able to feel it then it probably is in place. Another rare possibility of chorionic tumors is there.All of these can be easily confirmed by an ultrasound examination. When patients with similar history walk into my practice I usually do a urine pregnancy test as it may come positive in cases with incomplete abortions and get an ultrasound examination done for further evaluation.

You once check for the pregnancy. If the test comes negative,  the spotting you are having could be menstrual flow. If you want to choose daine,  you have to start with new pack. But as long as you use daine,  the pregnancy is not possible as prevents the pregnancy. If you want regularization of the cycles and to plan for pregnancy, you can go for progesterone pills in the second half of the cycle. Decreasing the weight will help in regularization of the cycles and in treating PCOD. If you used 4 to 5 cycles of clomiphene,  take gap for few months. And try naturally by tracking the ovulation. Otherwise go for ovarian drilling surgery with your doctor's advice. For more details you can ask me directly through the premium forum.

If you had doubt regarding pregnancy, once go for blood test for pregnancy. Blood test gives more accurate result compared with urine test. If the test comes negative, no need to worry. Consult gynecologist and take tablets to control the spotting.Then you can continue with Minera. Take care."},{"Patient":"my girl friend is not having her periods since 40 days..recently she has stopped using pills.which she used for 8 months for controling pregnency.during the use of pills she some time had periods for 2 times in a month but after stopping using pills she had no periods.she had a pregnency test to and its all fine..what is the main problem with her and what are the measures?is it normal problem or its complex one?","Doctor":"Hi, I understand your concern regarding the missed periods. After stopping the oral contraceptive pill the return to a normal pattern of menstruation may require some time. Some women begin to have regular periods from the first month. But in some cases it may take upto 3 months for the return of periods. Since the pregnancy test is negative, if you have not used any other contraceptive measure, repeat the test after 10-15days preferably by using the first morning sample of urine. In some women, ovulation may be erratic and may not always occur on the predicted day of the cycle which is usually day 14 from the first day of menses when women stop using OC pills. Hence the timing of conceiving and becoming pregnant is difficult to predict. The repeat test helps in detecting a pregnancy that may have occurred at a later date. Meanwhile I would recommend that you use some other contraceptive like condoms if pregnancy is not desirable.If the pregnancy test it is still negative and pregnancy is not desirable then continue to use some other method like condoms and wait for upto 3 months if everything else is fine. If the periods still do not return she may need further evaluation and have an ultrasound examination as well as a hormonal workup done to evaluate the cause. hope this helps you and please do not worry as the matter does not appear to be a complex one at present."},{"Patient":"about a week ago i started a small intermittent pain in my penis shaft ,after that i faced a urine frequency with a little turbulence  and then i went to doctor and got UA test, there were nothing but a trace amount of blood and only RBC .doctor prescribed an antistone drop and anti- inflammatory  pill but after that my pain is continuing and spread from my abdomin to my gorin and testicles.please help me and guide what should I do, what is this?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.

It may take a couple of months after coming off the pills to regain normal ovulation. As you are almost due for your next period, you may wait for it and get a HPT with a fresh early morning sample 3-7 days later if you miss it. If you wish for an earlier and better confirmation, you can get the serum beta-hCG titres estimated. Hope your query is answered.

I am not sure what is going on I have pain in my shoulders and neck. The swellen on my wrists is tender and painful to touch and has not gone down after two days. Please help me with advise Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello friend,Thank you for posting your query through Healthcare magic. Strange for me- you appear to be very anxious and worried on Sunday because you cannot wait till Monday! And that too about a trail of symptoms you have for 25 years!You knew you had cysts and fibroids for 25 years. You did not sit for a moment to ask yourself or even to your doctors why you are getting lot of symptoms while most of the other ladies of your age do not get them. You have mentioned about irritable bowel syndrome, metrorrhagia, menorrhagia, anaemia, poly arthritis, Hypertension, lethargy etc. I am a Homoeopath and so there will be thoughts in my answer that are apparently strange for you, because you have been under the conventional method of treatment for a prolonged period.You took provera for bleeding, votorol and co-codamol for pain, iron tablets and menefenic acid tabs for heavy bleeding and clots, pritol for arthritis etc. I have to say that you are on a wrong path. After the consultation on Monday  also, you will be getting some more medicines to relieve some of the symptoms you tell to the doctor. You have confessed \\"I am not sure what is going on\\". Yes I am going to give you some food for your thoughts. Till date no body has told you why you are suffering and going from bad to worse in spite of taking treatments. First of all understand that all these happened and are happening because you have a genetic tendency to develop these sort of diseases. Genetic manifestation is not only in your body but also in your mind. Just look back to the query, you have not mentioned a single word about your life situations and your mental reactions to them. Because you are made to understand that your health is only physical. We Homoeopaths hold that your health and so your sickness also is both physical and mental. The cure also has to occur in both mind and body. Instead of getting cured, you are continuously becoming more and more seriously sick under the present method of treatment. You become more and more worried also. Because your genetics is not considered. Your constitution is not taken care of. Only the symptoms are managed just as the tip of the ice berg. You were not cured in any instance in the past . Your symptoms were only suppressed with strong chemical drugs. All these were actions against nature and nature will retaliate by producing more and more serious diseases. I am not talking about the possible side effects of the drugs used.What is to be done now is to come back and start on a different pathway to cure. That is the pathway of Homoeopathy. It is a new and less popular path way. Homoeopathy is a safe, simple, scientific, affordable and effective medicine attracting more and more people in the world.In Homoeopathic treatment, your genetic tendencies will be considered. Your constitutional peculiarities will be taken as important. Homoeopathy is an individualistic method. Therefore your life situations, your mental make up, physical make up, your general reactions to the life situations etc are all important to reach at your genetic constitutional curative remedy.Therefore you are advised to consult a very expert Homoeopathic physician at the earliest. Get all possible investigations done to make a right assessment of your  present health condition and hand over them to the Homoeopath. He will prescribe your curative remedy. I can also help you if you will get back to me with your detailed case through the premium question facility of Healthcare magic. I can even send to you on request a case taking format in which you can expand your case. With Best Wishes,Dr C. J.

I went without birth control for less than a month and had no intercourse during this time. The new IUD was inserted late November and I had an extra long period in December (2 weeks) but haven t had another since. I got a new sexual partner at the beginning of the year, we had unprotected sex, I contracted Herpes .. :( but still have yet to have a period. Now I m noticing my breast are extremely tender, I m having clearish vaginal discharge and excruciating cramps, lie-in-the-fetal-position-cramps. I m wondering what in the world is going on with my body?","Doctor":"your problems are a) absence of cycles and breast tenderness --> it is a side effect of Mirena, if the breast tenderness is 'bad' then use any analgesic like paracetamol 500 mgm 8 hourly. if it is severe then add a diuretic like hydrochlorthiazide 12.5 mgm once a day in the morning on the day of the breast tenderness. For absence cycles nothing much to be done, as it is accepted assosciation of Mirena. b) Pain abdomen and clear vaginal discharge --> with a history of Herpes, it could be a pelvic infection, which will require a check-up and vaginal smear examination,followed by an appropriate antibiotic. It is known as Pelvic Inflammatory disease. Also, u may need a ultrsound examination to rule out an ovarian cyst, which is very common side effect with Mirena. This cyst can produce pain if it is infected or turning. A hot water bottle and paracetamol would be helpful.So, to be sure, do plan a visit to the Gynae, as without a check the treatment.  would be incomplete. do get back to me with the results.

I never normally get spotting, but I started spotting today and have been having unusual discharge . I had sex during the last 3 weeks of January every time with a condom, but I read that my discharge could be a miscarriage . I recently found out I have Grave s disease though, and just recently started taking tapazole for that. Could you tell me the cause for this discharge and spotting?","Doctor":"Jolessa is a combined pill for contraception. Spotting is a side effect of Jolessa. Your concerns are on Spotting, fear of pregnancy and vaginal discharge. If you have been regular with your medications then the chances of pregnancy are practically nil. The vaginal discharge and spotting could be a side effect of Jolessa. However, it could also be due to a low grade infection in the vagina and the cervix, mouth of the uterus. So, you need to get an examination done and a vaginal smear examination, and then plan the treatment. Graves disease drug topazole, is known to produce agranulocytosis, (low white cells) which can predispose you to infections. So please get a Blood count done.Depending on the above, if there is no infection then the PILL needs to be changed to a higher dosage. Lastly please tell the doctor that you are on Pills as the blood levels of the thyroid harmones can be affected by the harmones. let me know if this was helpfulThank you J Nanda"},{"Patient":"hello i have the copper iud and have had it for about 4 years now about a month and a half ago just a few days before my normal cycle i had sex and a odd cycle not much bleeding then i got b.v. and not im on my cycle it was 2 weeks late. and have thrown up with the strange familiar feeling of morning sickness strck me .

About five days after taking it, I started spotting, which the following day became a heavy period with the most unbearable cramps I've ever experienced, and I have had heavy cramps and bleeding since I first had my period.  Thankfully that only persisted for that day. But that was about 8 days ago. About 3 days ago, I had no spotting or bleeding whatsoever but started getting pretty bad cramps, as if it were the first day of my period or something, but there was no spotting or anything. Now today, which would be day nine of this period, I have spotting again, cramps, lower back ache, like my periods just starting. Usually symptoms of my period don't continue past day 3 or 4 of my period. This is technically day 9 and I'm having spotting and symptoms still.  I guess it could be helpful to also mention that when I started this new altered period about 9 days ago, that day would have been day 19 of my normal cycle, had I not taken the pill and it alter my cycle. And I usually have longer cycles, 32 days or so, so if I had not taken next choice then I would be getting my normal period in about 4 days or so.I've taken next choice or plan b before, and nothing like this has ever happened.

After stopping the pills usually withdrawal bleeding occurs. You may be having breakthrough bleeding prior to that.Possibly this bleeding will subside soon and no need to worry. If the bleeding continues for one more week,  better to consult gynecologist once and take tablets to control the bleeding. As you are having problems with pills,  you can choose other alternatives like depo injections or intrauterine devices. If you do not want to use hormones related methods,  you can go for barrier method or natural methods. Take care."},{"Patient":"Please help. My bf & I had sex with a condom, but for some reason (sry to be graphic) ..video taped it. He didn't ejaculate, checked the condom w/ water & it was fine.

I'm nervous & need reassurance that the fluid was mine & not his. Can pre-cum overflow to the base of the condom like that?","Doctor":"Hi,From history it seems that fluid you saw might be due to normal vaginal discharge at the time of sex due to sex excitement but at the same time having some semen coming out from condom is equally possible.And again you had sex during your most fertile period which again increases the risk of having pregnancy.Ok and take care."},{"Patient":"Hi there I have been taking the combined contraceptive pill and two days before I was due to stop them for my pill free week I had the runs just after I had took the pill, I also had the runs half hour later and about three hours after that.

But vomiting immediately after intake of pill can affect the efficacy. As you took two packs of pills without break, that may be the reason for delayed periods. If there is any history of missing the pill, there is possibility of pregnancy. So if you want, go for pregnancy test once. If the test comes negative,  possibly you will get withdrawal bleeding soon. If you do not get withdrawal bleeding after one week also, consult gynecologist and take tablets to induce withdrawal bleeding. If she suggests go for hormonal profile once. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi doc! I got my first menstrual period last July 31 and started to take diane-35 (21pills) on the day of my first menstrual period.

Taking the contraceptive pills regularly at same time every day can give good protection towards pregnancy. Even if you miss the exact time, if you take the pill within 24 hours,  usually that will give protection. So possibly you will get the withdrawal bleeding soon. Wait for 4 more days. If you do not get withdrawal bleeding even after 4 days, go for blood test for pregnancy once. If the test comes negative, no need to worry and can continue with next pack.

Because ovum won't release during the menstrual period generally. While using hormonal contraceptives some amount of irregularity in menstrual cycles is common. The spotting you are having could be due to the hormonal fluctuation after removal of the ring. The ring can alter the vaginal discharge and also vaginal discharge can increase during periods. So because of these you might have had white clot and spotting. Possibly the spotting will soon turn into menstrual flow. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi. I was on birth control for about 7 months and stopped taking it October 16 2012. Today is February 17 & ever since I stopped, my period has been regular.

Please help me why I am late and what this dark brown discharge meant that night. After I peed, it was long gone.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for the query. Fluctuations in the menstrual cycles can occur due to many causes. The brown discharge you got on your expected date of periods might be menstrual flow only. Collected blood in the endometrium sometimes comes out as brownish discharge and no need to worry about it. Scanty flow can be due to causes like -Decreasing hemoglobin levels,  -Hormonal imbalance due to stress and strain, dietary changes, poly cystic ovary disease etc.-Thyroid hormonal abnormalities etc. So as there is no possibility of pregnancy,  you observe the next cycle.If same problem repeats, better to consult gynecologist once and get evaluated.

Myself and my partner were tested for all STDs before starting sexual relations. Many thanks","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing to us. The light discharge and dark brown discharge that you are having could be related to the hormonal imbalance caused by the high dose hormonal pill that you have taken. The chances of pregnancy are low but needs to be ruled out if the periods are delayed.I hope this information has been both informative and helpful for you.

However, I took my pill a day early (Monday 18th). Is this ok? Am I still protected? Many thanks, Emily.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing to us. Taking the first pill of the next pack a day earlier is not worrisome. This does not decrease the efficacy of protection. You are still protected against pregnancy.

Started a new pack exactly 13 days ago and took them religiously up until this pack. about two days after starting this pack I got strep throat and was put on amoxicillin. I was vomiting at night time (a couple of times) where I don't know if the pill had a chance to fully sink into my body. I went home for seven days, and about 3 days after I went home, I forgot a pill but doubled up the next night. and on day seven of being home I had unprotected sex with my boyfriend where he ejaculated in me. I went back to my apartment (this being the 29th when I went back) my boyfriend and I continued to have unprotected sex repeatedly over 3 day span from the 29th to the 1st. in which over those days I forgot two pills!!

I've been bleeding for the past two days (obviously my body doesn't know what's up) but Im stressing and I need to know the chances of pregnancy chances of having ovulated.

The possibility of protection from pregnancy by the hormonal pills is less in your case, as :- You had vomitings after intake of pill- Antibiotic usage-History of missed pillsSo you better use some additional method of contraception till completion of this pack. And the bleeding you are having could be withdrawal bleeding due to missing the pills.Possibly it will subside soon. Wait till your expected date of periods. If you miss the periods, go for blood test for pregnancy once.If the test comes negative, you can continue your next pack as per the schedule."},{"Patient":"Im 20, and a female, ive had the mirena birth control about 2 years now, after a year i stopped bleeding. about a year later im randomly spotting, about a week and a half ago i got in a wreck, and now for about 3 days ive been bleeding, kinda pretty bad, and some times its globs of blood... im scared to go to the doctor i dont know what they will say, can you help me","Doctor":"Hello.

Most common causes of late postpartum hemorrhage could be uterine atony, retained products and unlikely tear. If you are taking cerazette and any of the above causes are responsible then it is useless taking it.I think you should have been referred to a gynobs a while ago as bleeding for 4 months could be very fatal. Having uterine infection could be as a result of retained products and will need to be evacuated with D&C.

If this time had passed when you took the test , it can be considered accurate.If this time has not passed you may want to either consider an early detection kit or a blood HCG level , these can detect lower levels of the pregnancy hormone ,HCG.You should rule out pregnancy before restarting the pills especially if your periods are normally regular.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hello.

I took Plan B the morning after the first mistake, but then we had a little too much to drink two days later and it happened again. I was so scared about getting pregnant that I took another Plan B the next day, four days after taking the first one. I got my period or was bleeding about 3 days later, even though I had had my regular period 2 weeks before.

Life has been pretty normal. I take my pills every day at the same time as well.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing to us. The beginning of periods before the beginning of the placebo pills can be due to a mild hormonal disturbance. Since the periods are regular, there is nothing to worry.

Though you had intercourse during your fertile period, since you were regular with your contraception, the chances of conception are minimal. Yet, you should exclude/confirm pregnancy. If you wish for an early confirmation, please get the serum beta-hCG test.

Prolonged use of estrogen or progesterone can result in several side effect including circulation disturbances like thrombosis of limb vessels and embolisms. Please contact your health care provider immediately for assistance. You should get blood counts, bleeding and clotting time along with a trans-vaginal/pelvic sonogram to look for local causes.

While there, I was given an IV where I received antibiotics and steroids for 24 hours. After I was discharged I was given a prescription of Augmentin to take for 10 days. During this time, I did have sex for the first time. I am on the pill and I have been for 5 years due to PCOS. We used condoms and didn't have any accidents with the condom breaking. My last menstrual cycle was July 10th. They usually last for a week and begin either on the 3rd day of the white pill or the first day of my next birth control pack. I have yet to have started and I am a little worried (I'm on my second pill of my new pack). I know antibiotics effect birth control, but we made sure to use condoms that had spermicide.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. When a male ejaculates during masturbation his prostate contracts to add its secretion into the semen and the bladder sphincter also contract so that semen will move out of penis rather than flowing back into the bladder, the combined action of these two things causing partial urinary tract obstruction which makes difficult to urinate soon after masturbation but this will mostly resolve within 1 hour and a person can urinate like before without any obstruction. The swollen tip of penis might be due to the engorgement due to excessive pressure for urination when you felt urinary obstruction. Hope I have answered your query.

You can test for pregnancy if it has been more than three weeks after your last cycle through the blood test as urine pregnancy test may not give you any definite conclusions right away. I would ask you to see a gynecologist for an examination as well to correct if it happens to be a hormonal disturbance or further management if it is a pregnancy. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi! I am Tamim. A boy from middle Asia. My question is about my body. I am 18 years old. I expected my body to have a nice body with muscles. But instead I am noticing that my body looks slim. My skin looks very soft with less hairs. Maybe that’s a good thing. But my chest looks kind of odd. It is very puffy & protrudes outwards. When I see my other friends chest my one looks different. My nipples also look very big, dark in color and points outwards than them & my chest looks very big. & by very big I literally mean it. It isn’t like it’s small chest like pec muscles. It rather looks more like my moms breasts. Should I be concerned about this issue or be proud that I am like my mom?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. As per your description it seems like you are having a condition known as “gynaecomastia” , it is nothing but abnormal breast enlargement in men. Generally teenagers are affected and detailed evaluation is needed to find out the cause. Hormonal assessments are needed to rule out hormonal imbalances. No need to worry as it can be cured permanently by surgical excision of abnormal breast tissues. You can go for surgery if you are too much concerned. Hope I have answered your query.

The pills have not been suggested as emergency contraception as there are no studies anywhere about their efficacy in this regard. I cannot assure that the pills can be effective as emergency contraception though to some extent they could be useful.

The menstrual bleeding is a withdrawal bleeding and has taken the form of a polymenorrhoiec cycle. You have two options; either go for additional hormonal supplementation to correct the bleeding disturbance immediately through consultation of your specialist or waiting for a couple of cycles with regular intake of doses to see if the disturbance settles down on its own. Either way, you need dietary supplementation of vitamins and minerals.

So, you should take 4 tablets of Yasmin as the first dose within 72 hrs of unprotected intercourse followed by 4 more pills after 12 hrs of first dose.I also want to inform you that its efficacy is similar to morning after pills and you need not to worry for that matter.Good LuckHope this information is helpful and informative.If you have further queries you can directly reach out to me on the following URL:"},{"Patient":"Hi, Im 16 years old. I recently started the Depo shot in December of 2012, and automatically stopped having periods. I didn t have one in January, and when February came along I didn t get my period when I normally would either. How ever last week on February 18th I started having a small, what I thought was a period. But it was very light and not the usually color my period normally is. It was almost like a brown color. It was very light bleeding .. Really it s just been spotting. But it s been 8 days now and I m still spotting. I also noticed last night a very weird and almost foul oder. I don t know what s wrong or if this is because of depo or not. I am sexually active and keep myself clean, I ve only been with one guy.","Doctor":"Hello,First thing, you must exclude possible pregnancy by undergoing one home pregnancy test or blood test for beta-hcg. Though, failure rate of depo shot is quite low (0.3%).Depo shot has several side effects like irregular spotting, delayed period or amenorrhea, headache, abdominal bloating or cramp etc. It is more common with first time user.Foul smelling occurs mostly due to vaginitis, associated with bacterial infection. One vaginal swab test can confirm this. Kindly, consult with gynecologist for overall check up and take proper antibiotic treatment to get rid of this. Till then, you would maintain genital hygiene properly. Good luck."},{"Patient":"I have had the mirena iud for 3 months with approx 6 days of no bleeding here and there. Mostly it's been a tolerable spotting, for the past week I have been on a heavy period which is becoming lighter. Although I've had clots throughout the periods today I have seen a somewhat large size the length of a small tampon. Should I be worried? I have also been becoming lightheaded when I get up from laying down or sitting down in my own mind I think this is maybe anaemia?","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to Healthcaremagic.Yes you may have anemia.But this needs either iron tablets or injection depends on your hemoglobin level in blood.Regarding your spotting and heavier bleeding, It is very common with Mirena IUD for initial 3 to 6 months.Thus your body needs adjustment for the Mirena IUD.After these 3 to 6 months, your body may adjust and your periods may resume to normal.So you do not need to worry too much about this. If you are my patient, I will prescribe iron tablets for 2 months after checking the hemoglobin concentration in blood. I ask you wait for 3 more months and review.Hope this helps.If you have additional questions or follow up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your queries.

Should I take mirena outOr wait to see after my period comes?","Doctor":"Hi,I feel that you should see your gynecologist for a physical exam to ensure that the IUD is in position. You should also get a serum beta-hCG assay to exclude/confirm pregnancy as well as urinalysis. You should get the device removed immediately if either you are pregnant or if the device has been displaced. If it is neither and there is some urinary infection, you should get it treated and the device may be left intact if you wish so. Hope you find this information useful.

Copper toxicity due to copper T IUCD has not been reported. The dose of copper in the coil is very small and it primarily is released into the uterus and acts locally to p roduce contraceptive effects. First, you need a thorough general checkup including an ENT check up. You also seem to be suffering from premenstrual syndrome which explains the problems you are facing before your periods. It is very important for you to have a check for Diabetes. Frequent infections may point out to undetected Diabetes. Fungal infections may be related to your occupation.

I have regular periods. Avg cycle 28-29 days. I had a regular cycle from Aug 4-8 (5 days). My bf and I had an unprotected encounter on Aug 10 (day 7 of my cycle) and I had an I-pill (emergency contraceptive) within an hour. The next day, i.e. Aug 11 (day 8 of cycle) the condom broke. I didn't want to pop a pill again so didn't. I had mild bleeding that started on Aug 15 (day 12 of cycle) at night. It lasted until today, i.e. Aug 18 (day 15 of cycle). Unfortunately, the condom broke today again (this literally angers me). Had to take in an Unwanted 72 (emergency contraceptive).My question is:What exactly was the bleeding on Aug 15 (day 12 of my cycle)? Was it ovulation bleeding (I never got that ever in life), effect of the pill (withdrawal bleeding) or implantation bleeding (so wishing it isn't this one)? The bleeding was scanty as compared to my regular cycle but enough to make me wear a single pad all day (not soaking it but still not little enough for Undergarment to hold).When should I be expecting my next period?

ECs notoriously alter the normal course of the menstrual cycle, your ' normal' period next time around could be a week or ten days earlier or later than expected. There is no way to predict when it would be.3. Well, EC s are over 95 % effective in preventing a pregnancy when taken within 24 hours, so the chances of pregnancy are quite low.

I home pregnancy tested one week after the brown discharge in case it was implantation bleeding and it was negative. I am 27, weight 9 stone and am 5 foot 2.My question is whether it is sensible to test again or if this is just a sympton of coming off the pill. Also if my periods remain as irregular as they were when I was a teenager what are the chances of me conceiving naturally and what medications are there to regulate periods?","Doctor":"Hi,In the present clinical picture, you may opt for the serum beta-hCG measurement to give you better confirmation of the presence or absence of pregnancy; also, home pregnancy tests may not be of much use when the last normal menstrual period is vague. It remains to see if the PCOD has returned and if it happens, if you wish to conceive now, the ideal method would be to go for induction of ovulation after proper investigation and necessary corrections.

I do not remember exactly what day it was that I had went an got the injection, except it was the 2nd week of may at the latest. I am due now for the next dosage and have not yet gone to get it. My husband and I have been sexually active with no protection and I started having weird symptoms showing up. The first week I had cramps and sore nipples, the 2nd week (this week) my nipples have become itchy and still sore, the cramps are still present and when I get up to quickly or move suddenly I have the same sensations shoot across my abdomen as round ligement pain. I noticed a few days ago I started having a thin white milky discharge and my cervix was moving up and down. One night it would be really low and a few night later it would be really high. The discharge has now turned into a thick milky lotion substance just like when I was pregnant. There is no odor nor color to it and it does not itch. I have began having miagrains this past week also and just an over whelming feeling of not gettin enough sleep along with very vivid dreams that are awaking me. Is it possible that I could be pregnant again, or could these just be symptoms of the depo shot wearing out of my system.

To clear confusion, you may undergo one home pregnancy test.Milky white vaginal discharge is quite physiological. It may be due to extra dose of progesterone (depo shot) which also causes sore nipples. As it has no odor or color or itching, you have nothing to worry. Just maintain your genital hygiene.Take some medication for migraine after consultation with doctor. Take balanced diet and drink more water.

Im supposed to get my period between now or in the next couple of days. Could I be pregnant? Or is this a side effect of going of off birth control?","Doctor":"Hello Good Evening,This might be either implantation bleeding or pill side effect bleeding:Implantation bleeding – a very early sign of pregnancy – occurs when the fertilized egg attaches to the uterine lining. During implantation, the fertilized egg (called a blastocyst at this stage of development) burrows and embeds itself underneath the wall of the womb (uterus). Because the uterine lining is rich with blood, some women can experience spotting and even cramping during this process.For the most part, implantation bleeding is lighter and occurs earlier than your regular menstrual period. Sometimes, however, implantation bleeding may be heavier, so it can be easily confused with a regular period. So both the possibilities are there, so you should wait for next 5-7 days and get urine pregnancy test done.Regards,Dr. Naresh Jain."},{"Patient":"I an on birth control , have not missed any days. my partner and i last had sex on 16th November. we did not use a condom.My period came on time and lasted five days, however i have really visible blue veins on my breasts and have lower back pain and some lower abdominal cramping.

It is essential for the production of eggs and for the preparation of the uterus for pregnancy.If egg get fertilized with the sperm then fertilized egg get implanted in the uterus wall after some days, and next menstrual bleeding does not occurred.It means you have your regular period on time then it means there is nothing like pregnancy.Amenorrhoea (missed period) is the first and most important sign of the pregnancy, hence you are not pregnant.Your symptoms are not related to pregnancy, you should consult to your GP, if they remain persist.Regards,Dr. Naresh Jain."},{"Patient":"Hi,just a query.

Pills are hormone based and can alter the concentrations of your natural hormones there by leading to menstrual irregularities. Since you changed abruptly your initial birth control and introduced a new one, it is possible that it is the change that lead to this. Menstrual irregularities eg, spotting, breakthrough bleeding or amenorrhea can occur during its use. Most of these side effects are mild and usually disappear after a few months of contraceptive use. So I suggest you worry less as stress on its own can lead to menstrual irregularity. Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"I m 18, on birth control that s making me very nauseas.

The other thing is that you may also be having vaginal infection which may be the cause of your soreness in lower abdomen, which is also common in any intrauterine device insertion and can be effectively treated"},{"Patient":"Hi i had the mirena coil fitted on the 31st January,but i have been bleeding since the 7th Jan.

A lot of your symptoms could be Mirena related but not all. Blood in BM for example is unlikely to be IUD related. Your scheduled to have it removed and that's good.

They are real and when they become unbearable, trying out other methods of contraception is advised.Beside pills, there are other temporary methods of birth control like intrauterine device, injections, implants etc. The best thing t do is to talk with your doctor so that he can evaluate and recommend an alternative method to you.

You have 10 million sperm count which is on the lower side, with increased liquefaction time,around 60% immotile sperms and may pus cells. So you are having oligospermia( low sperm count) and pyospermia ( infection in semen), the cause of low sperm count and decreased motility along with increased liquefaction time is all due to infection in the semen.

Symptoms directly related to the depo shot causing a change in hormone levels2. A hormonal imbalance due to other causesWhich is why you would have to get your hormone levels checked. You did mention taking a urine test, but have not mentioned the results, so I am assuming these were i conclusive.

Folate lowers the risk of having rare neural tube birth defects in a pregnancy occurring during Beyaz use or shortly after stoppingDo not use Beyaz or YAZ if you smoke and are over age 35. Smoking increases your risk of serious side effects from the Pill, which can be life-threatening, including blood clots, stroke or heart attack. This risk increases with age and number of cigarettes smoked.Beyaz and YAZ increase the risk of serious conditions including blood clots, stroke, and heart attack. These can be life-threatening or lead to permanent disability. The risk of blood clots is highest during the first year of use. This increased risk is highest when you first start taking birth control pills and when you restart the same or different birth control pills after not using them for a month or more. Users of drospirenone-containing pills (like Beyaz and YAZ) may have a higher risk of blood clots than users of birth control pills that do not contain drospirenone.

Please remember that the emergency pill contains excess hormone and could cause some amount of breakthrough bleeding and it is likely to disturb your next cycle. In the current situation, it would be advisable not to switch the birth control pill you have already started taking as changing the pill in the middle of a cycle is not going to give you any protection for that cycle and is likely to cause menstrual disturbances.

It may also occur with other hormonal contraceptives.generally it is associated with abdominal pain and cramps or uneasiness.delayed periods is also a side effect of OCP usage.generally breakthrough bleeding resolves on its own.Breakthrough bleeding that does not resolve on its own patients are advised to try different pill formulations, or to switch to a non-hormonal method of birth control.i think the current pill is not suiting you,hence i advise you to consult your OB/GYN to change your pill.thank you,wishing you good health"},{"Patient":"I had the implanton put in three years ago, I know it time for it to come out, just haven t had the money to do it without insurance.

Please tell me what I need to do.","Doctor":"hi,thank you for your query.what you are experiencing are the side effects of implanon.it has run out its usage period of 3 yrs.Women using Implanon who have higher circulating estradiol levels and ovarian follicle activity may be at greater risk of such abnormal patterns of bleeding.Women using progestin contraceptives who have abnormal uterine bleeding have elevated levels of endometrial enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinases and neutrophil elastase, that prevent epithelial tissue repair.hence the darker blood.the common side effects include periods that may be early or late, shorter or longer, heavier or lighter than normal. You may also have some spotting between periods, especially during the first several months of use.If bleeding is prolonged (more than 8 days) or unusually heavy, contact your doctor. If you miss 2 periods in a row, contact your doctor for a pregnancy test.thank you,wishing you good health"},{"Patient":"i get sick to my stomach after eating at times and just out of the blue.

Utilizing this method does not interfere with birth control pills. On the other hand, birth control pills are more effective than emergency contraception (when properly used) and there is no additive effect.Taking an emergency contraception medication can cause nausea and vomiting, especially if taken with birth control pills. Other side effects include menstrual changes, potentially causing the next menstrual period to be irregular. The morning after pill can also cause fatigue, a headache and abdominal pain.i would advise you to continue your pill regimen,your periods will come delayed but will come surely.from next time dont mix up the pills.thank you,wishing you good health"},{"Patient":"hi doc, i had my unprotected sex 9 days just after my 1st day of menstruation, i did a research and found out that Nordette will be helpful as ECP.

The drug and dose you took for emergency contraception (EC) is correct and you didn't vomitted after first dose.It was only that you vomitted after second dose and that too after 3 hours.Stomach emptying time is 2 to 3 hours.This means there was no drug in your stomach by the time you vomitted and EC would be effective.

The discharge is not heavy enough for a tampon . a light panty liner does the trick. what could it be? I am 22y/o causcasion weigh 140 and 5 8 . Thanks, Erica","Doctor":"Hi thanks for the query.This discharge may be mid-cycle discharge or due to some infection.If you have itching, irritation or foul smelling discharge then chances of infection are more.In that situation, you should take antibiotic pessaries after proper prescription. I don't see any advantage of pregnancy test so early.

As of now, you should use barrier contraceptive method for protection.

Recently I had unprotected sexual intercourse with my girlfriend who is on birth control (Junel Fe Birth Control) and has been taking it for over a year I believe. During intercourse I believe I could have possibly ejaculated inside her vagina…This week she is on her set of “brown pills” which indicates her period week. I am concerned and would like any opinion on if we should get the day after pill (For example, Plan B) or if we should be fine considering she is on birth control already?","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your question here, I will try to answer it to the best of my abilities. Supposedly you cant get pregnant during the week when you are taking the brown pill if you've been taking the pills regularly so far. So there is no need to worry.As for whether or not to take an emergency pill, well you could just take it for the benefit of the doubt, to clear all suspicions away so that you can sleep relaxed.I hope this answered your question."},{"Patient":"hi i stopped taking my pill for medical reasons just because i was bleeding in between my pill microgynon 30 thats was at 9th feb had slight light bleed just b 4 i stopped all pill in that cycle had unprotected sex about two week after and ive still not got my period i feel like im going to come on have all signs but no bleed. could i be pregnant or is it side affect from coming off pill was taking microgynon for 6 months.","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your question here, I will try to answer it to the best of my abilities. When you stop taking the pill, there is usually a seven days protection period, after those seven days having unprotected sex can get you pregnant. So whether or not you are pregnant right now depends completely on whether or not you were ovulating at the time of the act.So either take an emergency pill that works for more than 24hrs after unprotected sex as soon as possible or just wait and see. You should be able to take a home pregnancy test in around a week from now, that will let you know whether or not you are pregnant. I hope this answered your question."},{"Patient":"i was eagerly waiting for my periods coz av been using the depo injection for birth control ,,,i used it last on dec,,and my periods showed up yesterday,,but only yesterday,,and it was more of some black clots....and just lasted a day....im wondering wetha dat means im pregnant,,or do i have a bigger problem,,or is it normal?","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your question here, I will try to answer it to the best of my abilities. No normally women dont pass blots clots in their periods, it is caused by a number of problems such as fibroids, ectopic pregnancy, endometriosis etc..Each condition is different and has a different treatment, but the first that needs to be done is to confirm the diagnosis, for that you need to have an ultrasound done. From there we can start narrowing down the suspects until we have the diagnosis.So make an appointment and see an obs and gynae doctor as soon as possible.I hope this answered your question."},{"Patient":"Hello.

As far as I know there is no dangerous side effect of taking an emergency pill, the common side effects are nausea, vomiting and change in your cycle, so that the next period is either earlier or later than usual.I hope this answered your question."},{"Patient":"Hi, I m a 15 year old girl on contraceptive mixed pill , I missed it for 2 mornings and took both around 2:20 on the second day, and that evening (although I have been fingered 3 or 4 times before by the same boy) my boyfriend did it again, I don t know if it was rougher or something, but when I got home my discharge was pink, and I bled after that overnight. I have pains in my lower abdomen now. I have never done this before but I m slightly worried as to what caused it, a close call with the pill? Or did he break my hymen?","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your question here, I will try to answer it to the best of my abilities. Yes it is possible to break your hymen by fingering, but in your particular case I think your boyfriend was a little rough with you that is why it still hurts. So tell him to be gentler next time, you should be back to normal within a couple of days. Just give your body sometime to heal.If for some reason you keep bleeding and it doesnt stop, see a doctor right away.I hope this answered your question."},{"Patient":"Hi, I'm going on holiday tomorrow and don't haven time to go to the doctors.

Although it was already the 2nd round and he was definite that he did not spill inside me and he was far from cumming when we stopped, i still know that there are possibilities of premature ejaculation.  It took me approximately 57 hours after to take 4 pills of Nordette then 4 more 12 hours after.  I experienced nausea, back pains, and became very sleepy the past days.  Are these effects of the pills or early signs of pregnancy?  I took a pregnancy test yesterday to check. It was negative, but I'm worried that it still might be early to check.  What are the chances that I'm pregnant? Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi, I understand your concern and I shall answer your queries in points.1. Though not equivalent of normal emergency contraceptive pills 8 pills of nordette can act similar to emergency contraception. 2. The chances of pregnancy is fairly dependent on the timing of sexual intercourse when periods are very regular. Sexual intercourse close to midcycle when you are likely to ovulate is more fruitful than close to or after period.3. Chances of pregnancy are higher when there is deposition of semen within the genital tract.Based on these facts, your chances of pregnancy is remote, though not completely ruled out. Nausea and back ache are more likely to be side effects of extra nordette pills. You may wait until the next expected date of period and if you miss it (which is most likely due to additional pill consumption), get the urine pregnancy test done.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. This is a very common problem which is the loss of libido due to excessive masturbation, what happens is that due to masturbation the sperms are removed from the body and to make new sperms majority of circulation testosterone is directed towards sperm formation which leads to decreased libido due to lesser amount of testosterone available. I would recommend you to take a break from masturbation for 15 to 20 days and try again you will feel marked difference as your testis would be loaded with sperms and all the serum testosterone would be available for libido. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

The pill should be started on the first day of the mensus. The first tablet that should be taken should be from the first red tablet area. The tablets should be taken at roughly the same time daily and should be taken within 24 hours of the previous tablet. After the first tablet, you should continue taking the tablets in the order given by the arrows on the pills cover. above website gives a detailed explanaion of all the effects of triphasil pills.

An i-pill within two hours of the intercourse was a good move and it should reduce the chances of you getting pregnant significantly.Take a home pregnancy test and you'll have the answer you're looking for. Although it highly probable that your period is just late this month.I hope this answered your question."},{"Patient":"Hello, I just went off birth control last month and my husband and I were having intercourse every other day for about a week and a half during what would have been around when I was ovulating. I am now on day 32 of my menstrual cycle and still have not gotten my period, but have taken many pregnancy tests and they all came back negative. I tracked my periods for the past five months where I was on and off birth control and my cycle was never longer than 26 days. I have not had any spotting or anything. Should I go to the doctor to get a blood test to confirm or deny if i am pregnant and could there be a possibility the pregnancy tests are giving me a false negative? I have never not gotten my period.","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your question here, I will try to answer it to the best of my abilities.Stress can cause periods to start later than usual, even in women who have had regular periods for years. So that alone doesnt mean that you're pregnant. The fact that several home pregnancy tests have given a negative result points to the conclusion that you arent pregnant.Yes, a doctor's blood test is far more efficient than a home pregnancy test ad you can have one done, but I dont think you're pregnant. You're just getting a late period.I hope this answered your question."},{"Patient":"hello, i started taking noriday after the birth of my daughter 9 months ago.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I have gone through your semen analysis you have two main issues one is low sperm count and other is low motility, the commonest cause in men for this condition is varicocele which is abnormal dilation of testicular veins which lead to stasis of blood in testis which raises the testicular temperature causing death and deformity in sperms. I would recommend you  to get your scrotal doppler ultrasound done to rule out varicocele and in the meanwhile continue with the ongoing medication which are very good antioxidants which give a healthy environment to the sperms making them more healthy. Use these medications for 3 months and get your semen analysis done again and see if anything improves. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

When I started them I had my normal period but for only 4 day which I usually have it for 8 days. After it stop I had more spotting show up a few days later. Is this normal for the birth control to cause this random on and off spotting? I have also been having unprotected sex so I don't know if that contributes to anything. I was having it before I went on birth control and I never got pregnant so I'm not sure if its just the hormonal changes going on due to the birth control","Doctor":"Hi,If you are young, it is possible to get a few irregular periods. It takes time for periods to become regular. If you are facing some sort of stress at home, this can also cause you to get late periods. Thus, what you can do is wait and see if the pills are causing problems. Also, some females have mid cycle bleeding. this is known as mittlschmerz reaction. This happens during ovulation. The ovulation then causes you to bleed every 16 days. thus you will have 24 \\"periods\\" per year instead of 12. I hope this helps you. If bleeding is getting severe, then do consult a gynecologist.Dr Vineet"},{"Patient":"I have had mirena coil fitted for over a year with no problems.

I a so sorry to hear about this troubling thought of possible pregnancy going through your mind right now.Deprovera, like every other contraceptive is not 100% effective at preventing pregnancy.  Having unprotected sex on the same day after receiving this drug when it has not had the chance to start working effectively further reduces the chances of it doing a great job. Considering all of this and the above symptoms, I will suggest that you stay at least 2weeks fro the day of last intercourse and get a pregnancy test done.

But this month I have only experience a very small amount of a gooey stringy brown discharge what does this mean?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for writing to us. The chances of pregnancy have always been there with unprotected sex. The chances of pregnancy are there in your case because you had missed your pills and you have pregnancy symptoms also.

You can continue taking the pill as you did earlier starting tomorrow.

If you have  taken a missed pill within 3 hrs of due time, it will not change anything.

Through the two years I had never gotten pregnant...even though My partner and I never used any other kind of protection besides the birth controI. I had unprotected sex about twelve hours ago and have heard that you can take 2-5 birth control pills to be used as an emergency contraceptive. I'm wondering if this is true, how many pills of the tri-sprintec should I take?Thank you, I hope to hear back from you soon.-AAAAA","Doctor":"Hello Sky and welcome to HCM.Thank you for your query.Tri-sprintec is a birth control pill that has to be taken as advised by your doctor, not more, and not less.The usual instructions include taking it on the first day of your period, and then taking one pill a day. The 28 day pack contains 7 pills which are called the reminder pills, while you are on these you will experience your period.Please do not take any extra pills, one pill a day is more than enough to prevent a pregnancy. As you have already been on the pill since 2 weeks, and hopefully initiated it on the day your doctor has asked you to, and provided you have not missed a dose, then there is usually no requirement for you to have any other pills or extra pills.At times, we do advise one extra method of contraception, like the use of condoms, as there is a 2-3 % chance of failure of this form of contraception. As you have been on the pill, and provided you have taken it the day you had unprotected intercourse, you need not take any extra pills. So please, rest assured. The one pill a day course, is more than sufficient.I hope I have succeeded in providing the information you were looking for.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. You are suffering from azoospermia which means absence of sperms in the semen. It is of two types one is obstructive in which there is obstruction in vas deference which does not allow the sperms to mix with the semen the other one is central azoozpermia where there is decreased production of sperms. In your case vasography has been done and it shows patent vas deference which means that you are having central azoozpermia that your testis are not producing sperms. I would advise you to get your FSH, LH, and serum testisterone levels along with testicular biopsy to rule out the cause of azoozpermia. Moreover i would prefer to start tab.tamoxifen 10mg twice daily for one month to increase your sperm count rather then using oligocare tablet as i dont find it very helpful in my patients.

Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"hello, i wanted to ask about my case. my first day of cycle was 2nd of April. i had an unsafe sex with my bf on the 12th of April. he did pull out before he ejaculated tho, but as we know that precum does have live sperm as well, so around 4 hours after, i took postinor2, both tablet in once. i read in a lot of article, we supposed to feel nausea or vomiting. well, in my case, i dont feel a thing. i feel normal. too normal. this is my first time taking this tablets. is this a normal thing? do i have to worry about me getting pregnant? when do you think i will get my period again? and when am i suppose to get a pregnancy test, incase?","Doctor":"HelloThanks for your query.It is not necessary to experience nausea and vomiting with the pill, though it is a common side effect.Also, with the intake of emergency contraceptives, your normal period might be preponed or postponed by a week or more.You might also experience irregular spotting / bleeding anytime in between.You should take a pregnany test if you do not have your normal period 4 weeks after the episode of unprotected sex.Take care."},{"Patient":"hi doc, i used to take pills 3months ago then i stop it 1month ago..but before that while there is left over pills i have contact with my husband.. after that 1 stab , my menstration came..after 5 days, after that we used widrawal.. but now i was delay for 3 days..should i have tendency 2 be pregnant? i test week ago but its negative..should i repaet it? thnks","Doctor":"HelloThanks for your query.The withdrawal method is not reliable.YOu tested for your pregnancy before you missed your period, which is not the proper time.As you are 3 days overdue now, please take  a pregnancy test again.Use a reliable family planning method in case you wish to avoid conception now.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, I came off the depo shot a month ago and my period has not come back yet.

It may cause changes in bleeding patterns for subsequent 1 or 2 cycles. Dont worry ,as stress can also alter cyclic bleeding pattern.

I've taken one test and it was negative. Just want to know what's going on with my body, I've been taking the pill almost 3 years with no problems like this.","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicMicrogynon is a commonly used oral contraceptive. There is a form of oral contraception where essentially it is taken for 3 months so that these women have only 4 periods a year.It is likely that the prolonged use of the medication resulted in the delay you are experiencing. Though it is understandably alarming to you,  it is a result of a slight hormonal imbalance and your period will return.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi.

I recently visited a doctor because a strange kind of blister developed on the skin above the implant, the doctor assured me this was not due to the implant an told me it could be a bite. The blister thing has come again a day later I do not believe it is a bite any advice?","Doctor":"Hi,As of now, the cause of the blister need not be related to the presence of the implant, but, as the implant has been out of date, you should get it removed immediately and at the same time, consult a dermatologist for opinion and further care. Any displacement or breakage also should be ruled out. Hope you find this information useful. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi.

Around that time I had cramping like i was going to come on my period but it never came. Could that have been a side effect of depo? Also this morning i was really dizzy and I had to sit still, now I have a bad headache because of the dizziness. could that be a side effect of the depo also?","Doctor":"Hi,Your symptoms could be due to the effect of the depo shot since you did not time it with your cycle. Your period may get delayed or may not come at all as happens in some people. The headache and dizziness could be related to the effect of the hormone and you should get your blood pressure and other vital data checked to see if you need any medical assistance. If you continue having persistent discomfort you should report to your consultant and switch to some other contraception.

I also used a vaginal contraceptive film to back myself up while he used a condom. should i be freaking out this much about being pregnant? are my chances slim to none or very high?","Doctor":"Hi,Given the precautions you have taken, your chances of conception are almost nil and also the fact that your intercourse took place during the safe period excludes any chances at all. You may wait for your next period and if it gets delayed see your consultant for further care, which, I am sure, you would definitely not need. Hope your query is clarified.

Im not sure if this is because of the miscarraige or if the implanon has just made me less interested.","Doctor":"Hi,Hormonal imbalance created by contraceptive devices can lead to mood disturbances and as you said, your miscarriage is bound to have a subconscious  inhibitory impact on the sexual drive fearing the consequences. Please discuss with your health care provider if you have the need to change to another mode of contraception and try to get some counselling to allay your fears. Hope this helps.

My report says, Volume 4.0 ml, 12 mn/ml, abnormal spermatozoa 54%, total forward progressive 20% after one and half hours, after 2 hours 10%. Active sperm in the ejaculate after one and half hours is 9.6 millions. Please let me know how to improve these things.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Your semen analysis report shows that you have both qualitative and quantitave defects in your sperms. You have low sperm count along with poor sperm motility. I would like to investigate the cause of it before treating It. In 90% males the cause of low sperm count and poor motility is varicocele which is abnormal dialation of testicular veins which causes the blood to stay in the scrotum causing elevated temperature in testis which leads to death or deformation of sperms. I would advise you to get your scrotal color doppler ultrasound done to rule out varicocele . In the meanwhile i would advise you to start cap.evion and nacetylcarnitine these two are excellent antioxidants and helps to maintain good health of sperms. Hope I have answered your query.

Taking ECP shortly after that further reduces the chances. Also, having the withdrawal bleed even makes the probability very very low.ECP often distorts the cycle though it eventually gets a new rythmn for itself.f you have not still seen your menses by this time, then you at least need a pregnancy test and further investigations if warranted identify the cause.Please, beside having unwanted pregnancy from an unprotected sex, you run the risk of transmitting or contracting sexually transmitted infections.

I am experiencing some bloating and light cramps. The free ring week passed and I inserted a new ring. So. On this cycle no period???? I'm just wondering if this is normal do to me stacking the rings? Or can I be pregnant? I was always in the ring so I am confuse","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM.Thank you for your query.Insertion of the ring can cause some menstrual irregularities, so the delay in period could be due to that. This was followed by the insertion of another ring, not giving your body a chance to go about the complete cycle which would have eventually resulted in a period.Stacking of rings is not a problem, but you will have to experience your period at least once in a month or 2, or else this can lead to some repercussions. Your question is quite good. Yes, in such situations, it is always advised to rule out pregnancy, and so I would advise a home pregnancy test, using an early morning urine sample which would be most concentrated. Repeat the test every 5-7 days; totally conducting it 3 times. This will help in finding a pregnancy if present.Once a pregnancy is ruled out, wait till you experience a period before inserting the next ring. If there is a further delay, do not hesitate to visit your doctor regarding the same.I hope I have succeeded in providing the information you were looking for.

Consult gynaecologist to know about other methods of birth control, which ever is suitable for you if you are planning for some more years.As you are fallowing regular exercise and diet, you can maintain a dairy to calculate your daily calorie intake, this would help you know how much extra calories you are taking, and how to reduce that.Have a good healthRegardsDr. Vidya"},{"Patient":"I had the non hormonal coil fitted two and a half months ago which didn't suit me, I had cramping, bloating and a sore tender tummy.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I would like to see the complete semen analaysis report before advising anything. The most common cause in men for decreased motility is varicocele which is the abnormal dialatation of testicular veins which causes the blood to stay in the testis and causes elevated temperature in testis which leads to either death or deformity of sperms which causes decreased active motility of sperms. I would advise you to get your scrotal doppler ultrasound to look for testicular veins. In the meanwhile i would advise you to start cap.evion and tab.nacetylcystein once a day for 3 months and repeat your semen analysis as they are excellent antioxidants and helps to improve the health of sperms.

I'm so paranoid about getting pregnant hence why I've been using the implanon for 10 years now, I never had an issue in the past with unprotected sex.

It is essential to confirm the presence of an intrauterine pregnancy and also the age of gestation before having any type of abortion and this should be done under the surveillance of an expert.

It may be a breakthrough bleeding.All your symptoms are because of side effects of progesterone. In my opinion,you should go for an ultrasound first of all to rule out any pathology and you can try tablets of tranexemic acid 500mg thrice daily for 3 days to stop bleeding. If it doesn't help, then tablets of conjugated oestrogen 1.25 mg can be taken once daily for 21 days Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi my husband recently had a vasectomy and he was tested 2 months later and tested negative for sperm.

Bleeding, which you had after first intercourse, might have been because of rupture of hymen or your natural period. Pregnancy cannot be decided only on the basis of increased hunger.

In my opinion, first of all, you get a serum beta HCG test done to diagnose pregnancy only if you have missed your period and, if it comes out to be positive then, one ultrasound to see gestation and location of pregnancy. Only after that, you should think of abortion.

In your case, it seems to be the same. Brown discharge may be residual menstrual blood or it may be due to some local infection. If this is residual blood it will subside. But if it is due to infection then it will persist and you will need some treatment. Failure rate of pills ( used correctly) is very low i.e. 0.1.

I had that taken out in November 2011 because I had too many problems with it, and went back on birth control.  In july 2012 I took the morning after pill(I was laid off).  In sept 2012 after receiving my new dream job we decided to start ttc #2.  After I took that morning after pill in July I never got a period(while on bc).  After coming off bc I still had not had a period. I saw my ob in oct 2012 and he put me on provera.  For the next 3 months I still had to take the provera to have a period.  January 2013 he added progesterone.  I had a period on my own in Feb but none after that.  In may 2013 he dx me with PCOS(no ultrasound) and took me off provera and progesterone and put me on 1500mg of metformin, as of date I have not had a period.  Is it possible for me to have developed PCOS since having a C-section with my daughter in jan 2011?  Did the morning after pill some how mess my system up?  Should I be pushing for more extensive testing? I know it took 9 months to conceiver her but I had a period each of those months, I just don't understand why all of sudden after taking that morning after pill they have completely stopped without medical intervention? Also with the metformin how do I know when day 1 is if I have yet to start a period from the last provera round?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM.Thank you for your query.I can understand your concern and shall address your queries one by one.Starting off with your first query, PCOS can be diagnosed clinically with the help of symptoms, but still requires a confirmation using an utrasound, which I advise at the earliest.PCOS is a purely hormonal condition, thus affecting women in the reproductive age group, so the c-section would have nothing to do with this, but a hormonal imbalance could easily cause this.The morning after pill has a known side effect to cause irregular bleeding and a change in the usual menstrual cycle, but to an extent equivalent to almost no period without medication, is usually not seen with the morning after pill. This could purely be a hormonal imbalance, and if the PCOS diagnosis is right, this could be directly attributed to the condition.The more extensive testing you are talking about would include hormonal levels: estrogen, progesterone, testosterons, DHEAS, etc; along with an ultrasound to confirm the suspected diagnosis of PCOS.Now coming to some extra information, metformin is advised in women diagnosed to have PCOS, for two purposes:1. Normalize/regularize the menstrual cycle2. Loss of weight (in woman who are slightly obese)If you indeed have PCOS, and have noticed an increase in weight since the time when your cycles were normal, this could also be attributed to the weight gain. PCOS gets worse with weight gain, if you have put on weight, I would advise losing it.It is difficult to calculate your day 1 right now, as your periods are very irregular. Let us wait till your periods are normalized, and then calculate the day 1.I would also like to add, that metformin, birth control pills, hormonal supplements, etc; will all be used to normalize your period. Women with PCOS require a certain medication to help conceive (clomiphene), so this will be initiated only once your period is regular again, only once this is initiated, can you successfully conceive.I hope I have succeeded in providing the information you were looking for. Please feel free to write back to me for any further clarifications at:  . I would gladly help you.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"hello I have a question. I am a 20 year old female and when I went pee a little bit ago I wiped and there was some dark reddish brownish blood on the toilet paper. there was none in the toilet only when I wiped there was also  blood when I wiped my backside. not a whole lot but still some. this has happened once before months ago and again same thing when I wiped there was a little bit of blood but last time it was pinkish and it was only that one time till now. I have been peeing fine and it doesn't hurt but sometimes I do get these really bad tight shooting pains in my stomach area and when that pain occurs its also sometimes on my side as well as my stomach that usually happen after I eat something and when that pain occurs it makes me feel like I have to flatulate. then the pain will go away then come back one minute then go away that's happened for a very long time. so Idk if that pain and this is related I don't know but I would really like to know ur opinion please. also I just ended my period like a week ago and I take birth control and so its always ontime.","Doctor":"Hello,thanks for using health care magicI want to believe you have two separate problems;an abdominal problem related to food and the problem of finding reddish discharge/blood when you wipe.For the abdominal problem, you might be suffering from a peptic ulcer or dyspepsia since you said the pains is related to feeding. Am sure not all food types do affect you or cause you the pain. It would be important to identify those food that cause you this pain and avoid them together with spicy food, pepper, gassy drinks, drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen etc. But more importantly, you should consider seeing a gastro-enterologist As for the second issue, you need to be investigated for probable genital tract infections by being checked by a gynecologist. It is also possible that what you are experiencing is just normal since you just ended your menses and on birth control pills.Hope this helps you.Best regardsDr Achuo"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am six days late on my period, I am on birth control but i missed two pills in the beginning of the third week of pills and had unprotected sex.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Presence of pus cells in semen indicates pyospermia which is the infection of semen. It often leads to damaged sperms cells and decreased overall motility of sperms. I would advise you to start antibiotics from quinoline and macrolide group and duration of treatement is atleast 1 month as it takes time to eleminate semen infection. The cause of burning while intercourse might be due to infection or inflammation in the vaginal tract of your wife for which i would recommend you to get vaginal swab of your wife tested for infections.

I would ask you to see a specialist for a proper assessment of your condition and advice. You may need to exclude/confirm pregnancy through a blood test and a trans-vaginal sonogram, get a complete hormonal profile if pregnancy has been excluded and receive hormonal therapy if needed. Also, maintain a healthy weight and do some regular daily exercise. Hope you find this information useful.

You should also exclude urinary source of the bleed by a test. You should get a trans-vaginal sonogram to see if everything is fine and contact your health care provider for further support.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. The pouches which your husband has developed is called bladder diverticulas this is due to urinary tract obstruction due to enlarged prostate  Due to enlarged prostate there is urinary tract obstuction and it causes back pressure on bladder ureter and kidneys leading to bladder pouches,ureteric dialatation and renal enlargement The decision for surgery is good and hopefully after surgery your husband wouldnot have any urinary obstruction and the bladder pouches will resolve with the passage of time.

This bleeding can be an abnormal start of your period or it can be a sign of early pregnancy or, if not because of these two,  it can be contact bleeding because of some pathology or infection in cervix.

As per you history you are suffering from either vaginosis or yeast infection. In my opinion clotrimazole and clindamycin pessaries are good in treating such infections. You should get your blood glucose levels checked to rule out diabetes.

Is this normal? is she pregnant? or should we keep waiting?","Doctor":"Irregular uterine bleeding is one of the side effect of emergency contraceptive pills. Majority of women used to have period on time or early; in others it may be delayed by 3-7 days.In my opinion, you can wait for a week. Next choice reduces the pregnancy by 84%.

If the cyst is felt inside the scrotum above or around the testes then it might be spermatocele which is also known as epidydimal cyst which is the swelling of testicular tube,it is also a harmless condition and nothing needs to be done except pain control if required.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. The normal semen liquefaction time ranges from 20-30 min and anything above 60 min is dangerous and make the process of fertilization difficult, in your case i do not think that you should be worried about it. The main two reasons for increased liquefaction time is semen infection or dehydration. I would like you to share the complete details of your semen analysis so that i may rule out the infection. If there is no infection the the cause of increased liquefaction time would be dehydration and i would recommend you to increase your hydration status.

The failure rate of contraception with Implanon, the sub dermal implant that releases progesterone is less. You are doubtful probably because of absence of periods for the last 4 months. The symptoms you are having could also be due to an increased level of progesterone. But to be on the safer side you can rule out pregnancy through blood test or home pregnancy kits.

I have gotten period like cramps during the time of when i was supposed to be on my period. Can the Nexplanon stop periods that early or am i pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.You have had intercourse, five days before the expected date of period that falls during the 'safe period', so the chances of pregnancy is less. Nexplanon should be implanted during the first 5 days of period to be on the safer side, as it will exert protection without a need for additional contraceptive method if implanted during this time.If taken even 3 days before the expected date of periods, progesterone can stop periods. Nexplanon releases progesterone slowly and this may be the reason for the delay or absence of your periods. Although the risk of pregnancy is minimal for you, please rule out pregnancy through blood test. Home pregnancy kits detect HCG level in urine which may not be positive so early. But blood tests will give you an accurate information about your status.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"Ok I have a question Im 19yrs old & I am on the Depo shot I was suppose to go take my nxt shot on the 22nd of may but missed my appt.

If you had been using the shots long enough, then it may take atleast 2 months for the fertility to return back after you discontinue the depot shots, in which case, your chances of pregnancy is minimal. When the blood level of progesterone falls, it results in withdrawal bleeding and the spotting you had could be due to that. If you are doubtful whether the spotting is due to implantation bleeding, you need not wait and can rule out pregnancy through blood test which  confirms pregnancy within 3 to 4 days after implantation.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"I had a Mirena IUD in for a little over 6 months.

Although you have removed the IUD mirena it will take some more time for the hormonal effects of progesterone to get flushed out from your system and hence you are feeling the effects of progesterone.In some, the menstrual cycle resumes within 3 months whereas in others it takes a longer time for regularization of periods. Do not worry. The effects will wane off after some time.

Both are equally effective. Drospirenone is a newer progesterone and is said to be devoid of the androgenic effects of other progesterones. However the acceptability of a OCP varies among different individuals. Since you had been on hormonal oral contraceptives for a long time (5 years), you can opt for IUD copper T which is non hormonal. The other option is sub dermal implants that  contain progesterone. You should consult your gynecologist regarding this as he/she can decide the most suitable option for you.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"I have had the mirena for 3 years now. Recently I have been having pains that feel just like contractions and a sharp pain every time I urinate. I also can not feel my strings anymore.

My doctor can't get me in for 2 weeks , but I am in too much pain to wait til then. What should I do ?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.You are unable to feel your strings of Mirena  because it has  moved from its position and it could have got embedded in uterine tissue. Sometimes it can spontaneously move out from uterus and can get embedded in abdomen.Absence of strings accompanied by unbearable pain could  be due to perforation  in which case it is an emergency. But risk of perforation is usually high when it is inserted soon after delivery, ie., during peurperium.You should consult your gynecologist immediately and an abdominal X-Ray or ultrasound uterus will reveal the status  of mirena. If it has moved away then it needs to be removed immediately and you should opt for some other contraceptive method (not another IUD) for few more months.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"Hi there I have gone on Ava 20 contraception and I am getting really unconfortable tomach aches...it feels like acidity and I get nausea. Really uncomfortable. I was taking the pill at 1pm after lunch but decided might be better if I take it before I sleep. When I woke up I had sore stomach. I am also getting headaches? So is this the contraception?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.Gastrointestinal side effects like nausea and abdominal bloating are the most common side effects of Ava 20. Both estrogen and progesterone can cause nausea. Head ache is due to progesterone. These symptoms are  due to the contraceptive pill.Both the hormones in Ava 20 are rapidly and completely absorbed, reaching a peak level within 2 hours and that may be the reason for the side effects. If you are not comfortable with this brand, then you consult your gynecologist and go for other OCP with different combinations. Generally almost all OCP  contain the same estrogen, Ethinyl Estradiol but different progesterone preparations. Ava 20 contains levonorgesterol with a minimal dose of Ethinyl Estradiol (20 micro gm). Since you are unable to tolerate it you can opt for a different progesterone containing OCP.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"I am 28 years old and have been using Implanon as birth control since 2005. Recently my husband and I decided we would like another child but I have some concerns.

Is there any long term side effects from prolonged use of the Implanon (i have had it replace 3 times, no breaks in between)","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.It will take a while for you to get regular menstrual cycles since you were on implanon for a long time. However, implanon does not result in multiple births. Although implanon suppresses ovulation, once it is removed and the cycles are restored, it will not interfere with ovulation and does not result in release of multiple eggs from ovary.The recurrence rate of HELLP (Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count) is reported to be high in many women and so you should be very careful during your pregnancy. Periodic check up, avoidance of stress factors, balanced and nutritious diet are absolutely necessary if you conceive.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"I started my birth control pill pack on April 12, and took my pill at 9:00 PM like I usually do.

Should I be worried about pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.You have not mentioned if you have vomited out the sugar pill or the hormonal pill. Efficacy of the OCP depends upon the un interrupted intake of hormonal pills. No harm can occur if you have vomited the sugar pill but if it was a hormonal pill, then surely the contraceptive protection would be reduced.You need not fear about pregnancy as you have used plan B after the intercourse. But your next menstrual cycle can be delayed because plan B also contains progesterone and a high blood level of progesterone can delay periods. This delay, again can create confusion and doubt about pregnancy. So if your period is delayed,  do pregnancy test and rule out pregnancy as that will relieve your anxiety.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"Hi, about 3 weeks ago i ran out of my pill (On Cerazette) and after 4/5 days i started bleeding.

That same saturday night I had sex again. Yesterday (Tuesday) when I was on the toilet, the condom fell out from saturday night (so it was inside me for 3 days). I freaked out since this has never happened to me and took 3 birth control pills (sprintec) that same day (Tuesday). Should I go get plan b today or am I fine?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for writing to us. The chances of pregnancy have always been there with unprotected sex. The chances of pregnancy are less in your case because you had plan-B after sex. Don't take so much pills and repeat pills because they already disturbed your cycle, you should wait till your next period will come. You should consult a gynaecologist for examination to rule out any infection because of the condom. Good luck.

I started yesterday & ive been on it for two days now & i have been feeling nauseous and with strong back pain that i cant stand or sit for a long period of time. Is this normal to have strong back pain from this birth control? I havent had my period in 2 months so my doctor proscribed hormonal birth control to help my system i hope i can have a regular period soon. Any thoughts if this is normal??","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.Ortho Evra is a transdermal patch containing more amount of estrogen than the regular contraceptive pills, increasing the risk of estrogen related side effects. Such side effect depends upon the amount of estrogen absorbed from the patch and it varies in each individual. In fact an FDA advisory warns of a potential risk of increased thromboembolism in those with higher absorption rate. If your inability to stand for a long time is due to severe calf pain, you should rule out deep vein thrombosis, although such a risk rarely occurs within 2 days. Back pain may also be due to other causes. Higher estrogen levels  often results in nausea. Probably, your rate of absorption of hormones from the patch is high. Transdermal patches are much more convenient than the OCP, which needs to be taken at the same time daily, posing a problem for young girls like you and may be that's why Ortho Evra has been prescribed for you. But since you are having severe back pain, nausea and inability to sit or stand, you should consult your treating Dr. to find out if it is safe to continue Ortho Evra.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"Hello dr, I'm getting married in 2 months and i started taking yaz 3 days ago as an ocp.. But i heard from some friends that it causes sudden death because of increases  the risk of thrombosis and embolisms more  than other ocps, so they suggested to switch to belara and i have already taken 3 tabs till today. So is it right and what should i do  ? I'm 26 years old","Doctor":"Hello,Yes ,you are right.Your concerns regarding YAZ are genuine.YAZ is  fourth generation OCP and most of its increased side effects are due to the presence of synthetic progestin in it called as DROSPIRENON.Studies done in 2011 showed  that Yaz had an increased risk of blood clots, including the FDA’s study that showed a 74 percent increased risk in YAZ users when compared to other oral contraceptives.While all birth control pills carry a risk of blood clots, or venous thromboembolism, the risk from drospirenone is significantly higher, according to some studies.  YAZ has also been linked to deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot that forms in a vein deep in the body, typically the legs.  Once a blood clot forms, it can break off and travel to various places in the body, including the brain and lungs.You may talk and discuss with your doctor regarding the use of OCP in yourself.Thanks"},{"Patient":"Hi! I'm not on birth control and I had sex last night and the condom broke and I'm really scared now. I took 6 of my old birth control pills I had left over because I don't want to be pregnant. Will this help? I don't have enough money for the morning after pill and someone told me taking so many of my old birth control pills will help.","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.Since you say that the 6 pills are 'your' old birth control pills, I presume that you are aware if they are hormonal pills or sugar pills.  Also it is highly improper to take all 6 tablets at the same time as they may result in side effects and also can \\"delay\\" your periods causing more anxiety. The morning after pills contain mainly progesterone at a high dose whereas the birth control pills contain both estrogen and progesterone and so both are different in action.It is doubtful to say if the pills will be effective as you have not mentioned how old they are. If they are too old then the hormonal effect may not be there. Even if it is successful this time please do not repeat such practice again as it is harmful.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"I have the mirena iud, had it over 9 months now. I got a period at first but as months went on it seemed to go away, only maybe getting a very lite one every two months.

Have taken a few home pt and negative. The cramping has not gone away. I go tomorrow for blood test because im suppose to be getting my tubes tied next month. I just keep thinking I'm pregnant. I just had a small thick order less snot mucus discharge. Does this mean I am pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.Mirena IUD contains progesterone. It releases progesterone slowly for a period of 5 years. Ammenorrhea (absence of period), bloating, breast tenderness and abdominal cramps are all due to the progesterone released from mirena. Absence of periods indicate that the progesterone level in your body is high and that may be the reason for the side effects. Though  mirena releases progesterone, it does not suppress the regular synthesis of progesterone from ovaries and that may be the reason for the elevated level of progesterone.Withdrawal bleeding will occur only when the level of progesterone comes down. Progesterone will prevent the implantation of fertilized ovum in the uterus. Also, an IUD serves as a foreign body in uterus and prevents pregnancy and so the chances of pregnancy are minimal with mirena. You are anxious about conception because of absence of periods. Although the failure rate of mirena is only 0.1 to 0.4%, it is better to rule out pregnancy through  blood test as you have decided because that will relieve your anxiety.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"I have been on the depro Vera shot for a little under a year when I first started it I had some minor bleeding for a while but it stopped and my periods stopped also I haven't had any periods or spotting in 5 month until today after an argument I began bleeding it was short and heavy it concerns me because it was so random","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.Alteration in period cycle, heavy bleeding or minimal flow after a depot provera shot are common. Depending upon the individual, progesterone in the depot preparation can result in either too much or too little flow.  Also the menstrual cycle will be erratic and that's why it is not suitable in young girls.Progesterone can also result in mood swings. Premenstrual tension  may the reason for your emotional outburst. However, the failure rate of progesterone depot is minimal and it is very effective in preventing the conception.

I've take multiple preg test and all look like neg. please help! thanks in advance","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.Your symptoms may either be due to pelvic inflammatory disease or bacterial vaginosis. Birth control pills can result in irregular menstrual flow or complete absence of period after stopping them, they may not result in  abdominal cramps and discharge.. The increase in weight in your lower abdomen area may be due thickening of endometrium that is common in delayed periods. Multiple negative pregnancy tests does not necessarily indicate absence of conception as the reliability of home pregnancy tests varies unless you do it meticulously. So, it is always safer to exclude pregnancy through blood tests or through physical examination by a Dr. You should consult a gynecologist to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out pregnancy. You may need antibiotics or anti fungal agents depending upon the type of infection.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"I have been taking ortho tri cycles for over 10 years, recently on my third week, I missed 2 pills, which was the Thursday and Friday, on sat morning, when I noticed,  I took the 2 missed pills right away, so I did not take any more pill on sat at my regular time, on Sunday I took sat. Pill and Sunday pill, I should get my period yesterday, ( wed) but till now it still did not happen, am I ok?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.Ortho tri cyclen contains same amount of estrogen in all 21 pills but varying doses of progesterone for every 7 tab (so called tri cyclen). For effective action, OCP should be taken at the same time every day. If you miss one pill, you should take two pills the next day at the usual time. If you miss more then 2 pills as in your case, you should discontinue the pack, go in for some other alternative method and start the next pack after you get regular period. The last 7 pills contain more amount of progesterone. So, the reason for your delayed period may either be due to increased level of progesterone or may be failure of contraceptive protection and it is too early to come to any conclusion now. So, wait for a week and still if you don't get withdrawal bleeding, then consult a gynecologist or rule out pregnancy through home pregnancy test.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 25 years old.

Paracetamol may help but if pain is very severe and unbearable and if bleeding is heavy, or if the thread is not in place, then you should consult your gynecologist. X-Ray or ultrasound will help to rule out complications like perforation or expulsion.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"I sort of regularly forget my birth control, like a lot. I'm not sexually active, so that isn't a concern, but today I'm having stomach pains and my head hurts a bit, and I just feel nauseous. Could this be the missed birth control? Is that a serious problem, or will I be okay if I just start making sure that I always take it on time?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.The main problem of failure in taking the OCPs is unwanted pregnancy and this does not normally cause the symptoms you mention unless you have taken more than two pills the previous day to compensate for the missed pills as your symptoms are suggestive of progesterone excess. Since the OCP are hormonal pills, they need to be taken  properly otherwise they may result in unnecessary hormonal imbalance.You should take the pills regularly and that too on the dot in the same time. If you miss the pill one day, you can compensate by taking two pills on the next day. But if you miss more than 2 pills, you should discontinue that pack and opt for some other contraceptive method till you get your next menstrual cycle. Although your symptoms are not a serious, if it continues you should visit your treating Dr. Try to take the pills regularly in future to avoid such problems.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"I have been on the birth control Kelnor 1/35 for a few years now and it has work great. Just this past month, my doctor without telling me put me on Zovia 1/35. I read that these two are 'similar' but I am now noticing my thoughts upsetting me, over thinking, and thinking my feelings have changed for someone or something when just a week ago when I first took this new pill, I was fine. This does not feel like myself and I am becoming very overwhelmed and upset.  Do you think it is because of the switch?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.Both Kelnor and Zovia contain equal amounts of Ethinodiol diacetate and Ethinyl estradiol. The acceptability of oral contraceptive preparations in various individuals differ from each other. Therapeutically both preparations are found to be equally effective. According to surveys conducted, the order of side effects reported by people using Kelnor 35 is nausea, bloating, anxiety, breast pain and depression whereas for Zovia 35 the order is  depression, anxiety, bloating, dizziness and breast pain. Since both are hormonal preparations, these side effects are expected. The symptoms of depression you have, is suggestive of zovia. Although it takes some time for a person to get adjusted to any new preparation of medication when you switch over from one brand to the other, if these symptoms continue or become severe, then you should consult your treating Dr.  You  can opt for Kelnor again but do not change the pills without consulting your Dr. I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"Hi there, I had surgery today for paraphimosis. The surgeon left while I was still recovering from the nitrous oxide, so I was unable to talk to her properly about what I need to do next. I would like to know if there are any dangers I should be looking out for now that I have had the operation. My foreskin is a real mess as she had to remove a section of skin to return it to its original position. I have noticed that there seems to be a lot of blood clotting right at the end of the foreskin and the foreskin still seems a little swollen. Also when I urinate, it flows out between the stitches, instead of flowing out where it normally would. I am just wondering whether these things are normal or whether I need to go back to the hospital to get them to check up on it. Also I am concerned that if I have an erection in my sleep, the paraphimosis will occur again. Is this a legitimate concern for someone who has just had this surgery?","Doctor":"Hi, For swollen foreskin you can use MgSo4 solution with bandage around foreskin. Apply antiseptic cream like soframycine over stitches. Take care. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

For postponement of period only progesterone preparations are given and the combination with estrogen is not suitable. Also progesterone is effective only if taken atleast 3 days before the expected date of periods and not when taken on the day of periods.In a normal menstrual cycle, the level of hormones fall just before the onset of periods. But since you took the pills the increase in hormones level would have prevented the onset of period for a short time. Now you are experiencing a heavy period because of the pills.If the flow does not reduce or stop in another 2 days you should consult a gynecologist for further follow up. In future do not indulge in self medication as that will do more harm than good.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"I started the depo shot june 2012, i had my lost shot dec 13 2012.

If age matters i am 23 years old","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.Although highly effective, Depot progesterone is not suitable for young girls like you as it can either cause irregular bleeding, excessive bleeding or absence of regular periods. These complications increase when you use it frequently as your case may be. Depot progesterone  is indicated only for those who are most unlikely to use other contraceptives effectively.It appears that your cycles are disrupted. If the bleeding pattern continues to be irregular, you should consult a gynecologist for necessary guidance. Drugs like Tranexamic acid may be helpful but check with your Dr before you start any medication as it can be taken only after your Dr's advice.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"sir my name is chandan giri I need a help from u that I have two years kids & I am living far from my family I am going back to my home now I don't want any child this time so I want any medicine for my wife that I can stop coming child.

Advised to take only once in a month.What was the necessity to take the pill on may 4th 2 days prior your last period ended. All the complaints you have may be due to the side effect of the hormone Prostinor (levonorgestrel). If you develop anemia it has to be corrected.

Birth control means are not a hundred percent guarantee against conception. May be you conceived inbetween and also aborted without your knowledge which was probably incomplete. Now the brownish discharge what you are getting could be the after effects with some retained parts with resultant  pains due the contraction of the uterus being irritated by the retained parts.

My questions are:-1) What are the chances of me still conceiving during this time although i took the tablets2) What are the effects on my womb/body from the consecutive use of the tablets?3) Would this overuse cause infertility? (i have taken the tablets quite frequently over the years)","Doctor":"Hi,I have a suggestion to make for you. If you are in need of the pill Postinor 2 quite often, then you rather take a contraceptive pill like Yaz or Microgynon on regular basis or go in for implanon insertion. It is easy and safe, and effective. You need to go for one implanon insertion just every 3 months.Coming to your answers:- The chances of you conceiving are almost nil.- The effects would be that there would be more of progesterone stimulation of the uterus and its lining. It could cause variation in the duration, days and amount of blood flow in your menstrual cycle.- As such, the pill does not cause infertility.I hope you get to understand my thoughts and think over it.Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"Hi sir.

Plase kindly answer for this qn.","Doctor":"Hello,Unwanted 72 pill itself does not cause problem in future pregnancy or conceiving issue.But frequent use of that kind pill causes irregular period with impairment of normal ovulation.

Combined OCP gives highest protection (99.9%) against pregnancy with regularization of period.Next, when you will try for baby, all kind of contraceptive methods are to be stopped for at least 1-2 months to regain fertility.Hope it helps for you.
