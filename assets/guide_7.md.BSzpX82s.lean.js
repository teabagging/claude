She s been on antibiotics for 7 days now and today the school nurse called because she was complaining of pain.","Doctor":"You need to consult ENT specialist. ENT specialist will do detailed examination of ear, nasopharynx by various scopes and will determine the exact source of infection. There may be perforation in the ear drum or the eustachian tube may be blocked or there may be some glue like discharge in middle ear which is responsible for such complaints."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, My 4 year old daughter is sufferring from cold and she couldn't able to breath properly during night time. Doctor adviced me to give Asthalin /nebulisation . Is it safe to give.. Please provide your advice..Thyank You Regards, Ananthi Ramesh California, US","Doctor":"Asthalin nebulization is much safer than oral Asthalin in children.During nebulization medicine directly reaches the target i.e. lungs and bronchioles, thus maximising the effectiveness and minimising the dose and adverse effects on other organs of body.While if Asthslin is given orally it gets absorbed in blood from GIT, it reaches all the organs of the body rather than reaching only the lungs and therefore it's adverse effects like increased heart rate, tremors etc are seen, further it's less effective and much higher dose is required."},{"Patient":"Sir,My Son is 8 month old but his body is very loose and weeping like Mently Problem.I have consulted child specialist and he reply that this is a C.P.

It repeated twice and i suddenly also couldn t breathe but maybe that part was because of fear.","Doctor":"Hi and welcomet to HCM, It can be neuropathic pain due to abdominall wall or spine nerves impact. But also it sounds like ureteral or gallbladder colic which can be felt on this side too. If you feel it again you should do abdominal ultrasounds to rule out some intraabdominal pathology or inflammation.

She has come down with something (virus, fatigue, etc.) almost every two weeks this entire school year.  Are immunities down during these high growing periods or do you think I should have some labs done to make sure everything is allright?","Doctor":"Growth spurts require increased calorie, protein and nutrients intake. However unless the nutritional deficiency is severe  immunity is not affected.

Kids with ADHD may have trouble with impulsivity or expressing their emotions, which can lead to angry outbursts.Guanfacine can cause Affect Liability, Mood Swings (Rabidly Changing Emotions In Short Time). But guanfacine causing aggressive behaviour seems unlikely.Your behavioral pediatrian may help you to find out what emotional triggers are responsible for aggressive behaviour."},{"Patient":"Hi. My baby is 8 months old, approximately 17 lbs, and 25 inches long. Medical History: He has Down Syndrome and two heart issues, one of which was repaired four days after birth (a Coarctation repair of the aorta) and is fine to this day. He has a primum ASD hole in his heart that may need surgery sooner than originally expected. Other than those issues, he is a healthy, strong boy who is right on track developmentally as assessed by an infant teacher who works with him and us once a week. My Query: He has had redness in his left eye for one week and one day (I cannot take him to a doctor until Monday at the earliest due to insurance hassles). He has slight watering and is rubbing it more than normal, but not constantly. He doesn t like me to get his sleepies out of his eye which is causing me to think it s sensitive. He turns away from bright sunlight and closes his eyes in direct lighting, but otherwise does not seem to mind the light. Originally it was a dot on his eye causing me to think he poked it. Now it s veining out from the color of his eye looking extremely blood shot or strained and while it has not spread to his other eye or to mine (eliminating pink eye as an explanation) it is not getting better. There is no gooey discharge from the eye, so that seems good, but I m concerned and don t know what to do until we re able to get him to a doctor next week. We haven t put anything in his eye (drops or water) out of fear of agitating it further. He is also experiencing a rash and constipation, but I am fairly certain the rash is dryness of skin due to upping solids to three times a day and thus washing his sensitive skin with our extremely hard water three to four times a day. The constipation also seems to be related to the solid foods and we are combating that with prune purees. Any ideas on what to do about his eye or how serious it is? Thank you for your help!","Doctor":"Redness in the eye along with sensitivity to light may be due to infection, corneal or scleral injury, allergy etc.You need to consult ophthalmologist to confirm diagnosis."},{"Patient":"hi my 4 year old daughter has tonsillitis she can t eat or swallow her own saliva it is pouring out of her mouth.she is taking a 10 day course of penicillin started on tuesday after refusing to take erithrymicin given on saturday.she hasn t eaten solids since last friday has lost a lot of weight she will only drink orange juice","Doctor":"Drooling of saliva in tonsillitis is due to pain associated with swallowing. This also causes loss of appetite.Ask your doctor to add ibuprofen and paracetamol. These medications will reduce pain associated with swallowing and your child might start eating and drinking."},{"Patient":"My 3 yr old daugher has cold symptoms with a heavy cough, and fever of 102.0 ear...she has a very bad odor when she urinates as well. she just started amoxicillin last night but i forgot to ask about her urine could this be something else that amoxicillin won t cure","Doctor":"Cloudy urine may be caused due to urinary infections, proteinuria​, kidney disorders etc.Ask your doctor for urine analysis to find out exact cause and appropriate treatment."},{"Patient":"always vomiting...its not like a projectile vomit but hes always vomiting even like 2 hours after food or milk and i dont know why, im not giving him too much and hes not sick....its not hurting him because it does nt seem to phase him at all...ive changed his formula twice but its not only after milk...if i give him a yogurt an hour later he ll probably vomit it up...i jus dont understand","Doctor":"Vomiting in a baby may be due to infections, reflux disease, cow milk allergy, overfeeding etc. Some serious causes​ of vomiting are intestinal obstruction, meningitis, uremia etc. but such causes seems unlikely in your case.You ask your doctor to prescribe some antiemetic medications and if not relieved ask for investigations like USG Abdomen, CBC etc."},{"Patient":"What is the treatment for an ulcerated eye in a baby - we are in West Africa and my watchmans baby fell and this has resulted in the ulcer - she is at the eye hospital and they are giving injections but say they may operate - is this standard treatment - the child is 1yr old","Doctor":"Trauma resulting in ulcer in the eye is a serious condition which can result in loss of vision in that eye.If your opthalmologist is giving injections in the eye and had asked for surgery, then you should proceed for surgery as delay could affect future vision in that eye."},{"Patient":"I get s stomach ache if I have anything around my waist that is snug (I avoid tight items).

There has to be a cause for this feeling of stomach ache if you use anything tight. There is a history of anti-reflux surgery in past but may not be related to this symptom. I would advise you the following:Consult a Neurologist for clinical evaluation, actual physical examination to see if this can be related to any problem in the spine like prolapsed disc pressing upon the spinal cord.Get an MRI of the whole spine.Consult a General Surgeon to see if there is a local cause like an inflammatory process still going on in the abdomen.

I am having issues of incomplete bowel movement and a lot of flatus but I can’t fart. After lunch and dinner, I also feel bloating. After having each bowel movement, I feel that there is still something inside rectus and I apply a lot of pressure to get them out but I can’t. I feel that some substance or gas is blocking the way. The same happens when I try to fart. I feel that I should be able to fart but even after applying a lot pressure, I hardly can fart a little. Sometimes in order to fart I had to urinate first. Due to incomplete bowel movement and lot of flatus, I can’t eat much (reasonable) food. That’s why during each meal, I only take the food that I easily can. I consulted MD for the issues and the doctor concluded on that I am having problem of ‘reduced intestine movement’; he said that this is because of 1) my routine work doesn’t involve much physical activity and 2) I get much stresses. The doctor gave me some digestive and mind relaxing pills for 1 month and advised me on doing exercise regularly. During the consumption of these medicines, everything was fine with me. I had perfect bowel movement and farting was excellent, I never felt any blockage inside intestine. I was able to take good food and my weight was increased by 4 kg in just one month. However as soon as I stopped taking medicine, the problems continued. The doctor said I should continue with exercise and mind relaxing, there is no other solution. In order to improve bowel movement, I also tried consuming laxative (Cremaffin) and Pegmove powder but they couldn’t make any improvement to the bowel movement. I tried taking fibers by consuming vegetables, I am doing morning walk/jogging for 3 to 4 Kms daily also, I don’t get stresses now but the issues of incomplete bowel movement and farting are still there.

She has had something since last saturday May 7. She ate a hot dog and an icee at Target. About 30 min after that her stomach started hurting and it is still bothering her. She had diarrhea 1 time and she has not run a fever. The odd thing is she has is just throwing up when she has severe stomach pain and that makes her throw up. She hasn t thrown up with every episode. The episodes are in the evening and she is in pain. After the episode she just lays down and goes to sleep, like they just exhaust her. Took her to the Dr and she checked her blood, urine and she checked for strep. All was okay. She put her on Zantac and that didn t help so I took her back today and she put her on Prevacid and we had more blood drawn and it came back perfect. The Prevacid seems to be working but this evening she had another episode. She hasn t been to school any this week. We are just at a total loss on what to do now. Dr. told me if she wasn t better by mid week to bring her back. Could this be food poison? Any answer would greatly appreciated.

On the 4th day he had a rectal exam and it caused some pain possibly as if a fissure or hemmoroid. the next day he passed more blood and a white ellipsoid object about 1 x 3/4 and covered with strings of blood as if it was a tooth ripped out of a socket, except it was 2mm length strings spaced about 5mm apart all around the object. There was fiberous stuff in the stool that looked like orange juice pulp, but he gets that frequently and may have had shredded wheat for breakfast that day. He has not bled since, but we are going to get a stool sample and bloodwork on Monday. I am concerned because his bowels have not been normal since he was 3 and threw up in a McDonalds with a stomach bug which we thought may have been food poisoning. He has a history of a prolapsed rectum in 2008 or 2009 (with a negative breath test) and no repeat prolapse. Any thoughts on what this could be?

Children with overactive bladders have a need to urinate more often than usual because their bladder muscles have uncontrollable spasms which results in involuntary release of urine and wetting.

I did NOT have diarrhea . The days following the throwing up I was very nauseous, light headed, and weak. I also had a terrible headache . I didn t eat much all weekend but continued to drink plenty of fluids. Last night, I had a weird feeling in my stomach when I touched it. It felt like something poked me on the skin. After looking, nothing was there. While sleeping I felt a pain in the exact spot every time i would bend or twist my torso. Now in the same spot, if I laugh or cough or sneeze (or hold a baby on that side) I have a burning sensation that is slightly painful. Can you explain what is going on??","Doctor":"Hi ! You have not mentioned the site of pain in your stomach/abdomen. However, the way you have described your symptoms and signs, possibly you have a sub acute attack of appendicitis, where you got nausea with mild fever which caused you a headache. You did not have a diarrhea, which is not favouring a food poisoning. With all probabilities, the sub acute attack has caused the omentum to seal it off with a localised inflammation of peritoneal cavity and a appendix mass formation, which gave you a weired feeling on touching. This can give rise to pain and tenderness on moving, coughing or sneezing or any work where intra abdominal is altered and the inflamed perietal peritoneum is distubed. In my opinion, you should take the opinion of a general surgeon by getting clinically examined in person, who may also advice you for some blood and radiological investigations like ultrasound abdomen. If it proves to be appendix mass, then you may have to be admitted in the hospital for IV drugs, and other conservative management, and the surgeon may advise you for an interval appendicectomy. Get yourself seen and investigated by your doctor at the earliest possible. Good luck."},{"Patient":"our pediatrician for our 15 yr. old has tested blood work for my son three times and the A1c is ranging high according to the index .....last test it was 5.9, before that 6.2, we have him on a moderate carb diet.

Any kind of infection in the body will give rise to fever, and so you had a head ache and body ache with variation in your body temperature. If fever troubles you, then you should take a tablet of paracetamol/acetaminophen. The hot and cold flushes you get could be due to excessive sympathetic activity. Your treating family physician may advise you for getting a routine test of your stool or blood sample apart from prescribing you an appropriate antibiotic and some anti spasmodic if the abdominal pain is severe enough to warrant it. If you get nausea/vomiting which you might, then go for an anti emetic. At the same time maintain your hydratioin by taking enough liquids ( small quantity frequently) mixed with some electrlyle powder available over the counter.

How do i tell and what should i do?","Doctor":"Hi ! As your pain is on the left side towards your left groin, one can not give much weghtage to the diagnosis of appendicitis, as the pain of appendicitis is mostly on the right side of lower abdomen, which may radiate to the right groin in some atypical positions of the appendix. Left sided appendix is one of the rarest entity. ]We can think of more common entity for pain on the left side of your stomach and lower back like collitis or food poisoning etc, as you give a history of eating outside food much. Also as you are constipated obviously because of your dietary habits, you may be developing diverticulitis of sigmoid colon ( a part of the colon) which can give rise to severe pain on the left side of abdomen. In my opinion, you should consult a gastro enterologist/ surgeon, who may decided on an ultrasound abdomen or a GI endoscopy apart from other routine investigations, depending on the clinical findings once food poisoning is excluded. Once you are treated and cured, please do not forget to modify your dietary habits like adding more of roughage and liquids in your diet.

Can we stop this medicine now since it gives other problems like drowsiness and tiredness ?? What type of patients are given such medicines ?? I understand from web sites that this medicine is banned through out the world due to side effects and active only in India & Sri lanka - is that true ??? Let me have a immediate reply pls Regards, Mathew Koshy Doha - Qatar .","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Divalproex Sodium is used to treat certain types of seizures (epilepsy). This medicine is an anticonvulsant that works in the brain tissue to stop seizures. Divalproex Sodium is also used to treat the manic phase of bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness), and helps prevent migraine headaches.Rarely, this medication has caused serious (sometimes fatal) liver problems, usually within the first 6 months of starting treatment. Laboratory tests should be performed before you start treatment and periodically during treatment, especially within the first 6 months, to monitor this side effect.The risk of serious liver problems is increased in children younger than  2 years, especially if they have an inherited metabolic disorder, severe seizure disorder with mental retardation , organic brain disease, or if they take more than one seizure medication. Talk with the doctor about the risks and benefits of using this medication in children younger than 2 years.Due to an increased risk for liver problems, people with certain inherited metabolic disorders (such as Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome) should not use this medication. Children younger than 2 years who might have these disorders should not use this medication. Children older than 2 years who might have these disorders should be closely monitored during treatment with Divalproex Sodium. Talk to your doctor for details.Hope I have answered your query.

Usually, these are viral illnesses and will settle down by themselves with symptomatic treatment with oral Paracetamol. I will explain to you how a viral illness behaves so that you will be more confident. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could be a viral illness. Usually, rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will be there for 4 to 7 days.

It has started many years ago... abdominal pain shooting down to the legs from the front, at times the pain is in the left hand side of the stomach, pain in the form of needles in the bladder region that makes it hard to sit, done many urine tests which at times show infection and at times show everything to be normal. I'm truly tired from these pains, please help! Are there any special tests that I can do to get the real picture?","Doctor":"Hello, and thank you for using Healthcare Magic! I will be honest and tell you that it is very unlikely that I will be able to give you much new or helpful information.  You say you have seen many doctors over the years and that no one has been able to figure out the cause of your pain.  I am so sorry that this is the case! The many doctors that you have seen have had advantages that I do not in trying to determine why you have these symptoms.  They have seen and examined you in person, ordered tests and seen the results of them, including imaging tests. If no physical cause of these problems has been found, it would be worthwhile to look into psychological causes for the pain.  One possible cause is what is known as a conversion disorder.  This phenomenon basically means that you are experiencing psychological stress and it is manifesting as physical pain and illness.  This stress could be related to work, relationships, money, or any other cause.  Here is an excellent website that discusses conversion disorders more thoroughly:  www.mayoclinic.com/health/conversion-disorder/DS00877 I hope I have given you some useful information, and wish you the best of health.

I am experiencing pain and discomfort in my lower abdomen area/pelvic area. It is bloated and it hurt after and a littlw during sexual intercourse. When i push on the pelvic area it hurts and pain goes up to my chest almost a stinging burning sensation. My husband and i have only been with each other sexually so what could it be?","Doctor":"Hello, and thank you for using Healthcare Magic! In order to precisely answer your question, I would need to ask you a great deal of questions, and examine your abdomen myself.  But I will try to give you some general ideas about what could be causing these symptoms. Fibroids - these are benign tumors that grow in the wall of the uterus.  They are uncommon in women of reproductive age.  If they become large enough they could cause the bloating and lower abdominal pain you are describing Endometriosis - this is caused by tissue that is normally only found lining inner wall of the uterus growing outside the uterus.  This pain is in the region you describe, frequently is worse w/defecation and during sexual intercourse, and also should be worse around the time of your menstrual cycle. Ovarian mass/cancer - These most commonly happen to women after menopause, but the symptoms you describe are consistent with an ovarian mass of some kind.  I am not saying that this is the most likely cause!  It is much more likely something else. The best course of action would be to make an appointment with your family doctor or gynecologist to be examined.  It is possible that if they suspect a mass of some kind they will order a transvaginal sonogram, which is the best way to take pictures of the pelvic organs. I hope I have given you some useful information, and wish you the best of health.

Yellow watery diarrhea 4-5 times/day, going on for 6 days now is a sign of possible food allergy or bowel infection.

It is highly likely  that your 14-month-old daughter is eating less now as compared to when she was younger just because she doesn’t need as many calories.Similarly, you must take a look at what your baby or toddler has had that day that isn’t conventional food stuff.

She also told me that her stomach was hurting but she thought it was the chipotle that we ate. The next morning she had some discharge and sharp pains in her stomach when she was eatting... so on that day she took plan b one step, 22 hours after unprotected sex. She felt better the next day. So today on wednesday we had foreplay clothes were on and just makingout and had a blowjob. Later she told me shes getting those white discharge again.. long story short do you think she is pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello, and thank you for using Healthcare Magic! From your description of the events it is very unlikely that she is pregnant.  If you want to be sure, it is very simple and inexpensive to get an over the counter urine pregnancy test.  The brief period of penetration is enough to cause pregnancy in some cases, but since she took emergency contraception so soon afterward, this is very unlikely.  Emergency contraception is quite effective when used up to 72 hours after unprotected sex.  However, it is not recommended to be used regularly, because of side effects such as irregular vaginal bleeding. Having said this, your girlfriend still needs to make an appointment to be seen by her doctor.  The thick white discharge that you are describing could be caused by a yeast infection, or it could be caused by a sexually transmitted disease (STD).  The most common STD in women is chlamydia.  If untreated this can lead to sterility, so it is very important that she be treated appropriately for whatever is causing her symptoms.

Hope This Is Enough Information.Many Thank. D.","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. Such symptoms most likely indicate inguinal hernia which has reached scrotum. As you do use fiber rich products, I assume that you have constipation problem. Hard pushing on stool can cause such hernia. So is heavy objects lifting or even coughing. Other possible reason of such large testicle is hydrocele, spermatocele. Testis cancer is possible however it is quite rare. You can put the flashlight into this enlarged testis, if it passes the light freely, the cyst it is. If not, hernia is most probable. Your abdomen has gotten bigger because intestines are probably in your scrotum what impedes stool passage. In such situation you should be aware of abdominal pain, gas or stool blockage, vomiting. If any of this symptoms will appear, it ca indicate urgent condition (bowels obstruction). You should visit general surgeon for the diagnose and if hernia will be confirmed, surgery is necessary.

Please type your query here... I have a daughter who will be 4 on April 4th. For the last week she has been asking for food nonstop saying she is hungry all day. She is small for her age. 29lbs, and yet her stomache looks bloated and sticks out. She also has urinated in her pants once for the last 3 days. She has been potty trained since 2 and this has never been an issure.She still wares a pull up at night, and wakes up with it soaked in the morning. She also complains of a sore tummy 3 or more times a week, for the last few month, she does drink a lot and wakes up 1-2 times a night scraming that she is thristy. She has also been having fits, and mood swings. She does have a new baby sister who is 5 months old. I m not sure if she is just acting out because of the baby, or if these might be signs of diabetes. Diabetes does run on both sides of our family. I m thinking that I should take her in and get her tested. Do you agree that this would be the right thing?","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for writing! I understand your concern! I congratulate you on your medical knowledge, and your good excplanation of the situation. As you said : polifagia that is the feeling of hunger, poliuria that is the need to urinate frequently, polidipsia that is the felling of thirst, and low body weight although eating a lot, are signs of diabetes. As also it runs in your family it is important to rule it out and to do a blood glucose test after fasting. So your child eats at 8:00 clock  pm and in the 8:00 am of the other day with empty stomach you do a blood glucose test to check. In base of the results you should visit and endocrinologist pediatrician. It is important to rule this out. May be she wants attention too but better rule out the cause of diabetes. Thank you. Wish your daughter good health."},{"Patient":"my landlord has over 11-month female baby. Yesterday night about 1240, she started crying and it took about an hour.

There are few possible causes: it can be due to joint degenerative changes or limbosichialgia but also there can be vascular supply insufficiency so along with MRI, doppler ultrasounds should be done.

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now My one year old baby had a minor fall a couple of weeks ago....four days after the fall she had an x ray.

In children usually, the seizure does not occur as you see in adults, they present only with uprolling of eyes or cycling movements or lip-smacking which usually parents miss. When a neonate presents with similar complaints septic workup and electrolyte are done to rule out infection, or electrolyte imbalance which your doctors did.

Completely understand your concern regarding your child.As far as the vitamins are concerned, B vitamins help with the nervous system functioning and being under constant stress can deplete the levels.

Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting. You need not worry.

Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic-associated diarrhea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for fourteen days) and ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is a very important and crucial part of treatment.1. Please do not give ORS-L premixed packs for kids. It will cause high sodium. You need to give the powder form ORS which is approved by WHO for kids.2.

Thank you for writing. It is normal for your baby to have gases. Usually it lasts until about four months, so don't worry. After you feed milk to your baby try to put him up lying with the head to your shoulder for 10 minutes rubbing her back in order to get rid of gases. Try to put her mouth good around the areola in order not to suck air. Feed your baby frequently in order not to have hunger because if she has hunger he suck air during milk feeding. I don't recommend you to use cola for your baby. It will pass as your baby grows old and the organism adapt gradually.

I just received a call from the same er and I have a staphylococcus haemolyticus infection. She couldn't elaborate on this very well and said a prescription would be called in for me. Is this contagious? I'm still in pain accompanied with really bad headaches.","Doctor":"Hello Lady Jen, Severe left flank pain is likely always due to UTI (particularly kidney infection or pyelonephritis) and if the ER called to confirm infection with Staphlococcus haemolyticus then you need to be provided with an appropriate course of antibiotics. Note: Staphylococcus haemolyticus is a member of the coagulase-negative staphylococci. It is part of the skin flora of humans, and its largest populations are usually found at the axillae, perineum, and inguinal areas. It also a remarkable opportunistic baterial pathogen that is well-known for its highly antibiotic-resistant phenotype. Ones they are found in some particular organ system such as the kidneys they can result to a serious infection which might require hospitalization before treatment is initialized. My recommendation is that urinalysis + culture+sensitivity test, blood culture+ sensitivity should be done. You should be admitted with IV treatment for a few days. Treatment should include an indicated (from culture) antibiotics, analgesic pain killer, antispasmodic and IV fluids. Of course the final decision will depend on your treating physician since he still have to evaluate your general state and decide on whether you need to be admitted or treated ambulatory. Hope this helps and wish you the best."},{"Patient":"my 6 year old son who never complains has been getting alot of headaches lately and today he feels like he is going to through up.

Your symptoms are pointing towards a chronic urinary tract infection which could be due to a persisting cystocele.

Coming out of urine while sneezing is possibly due to the weakness of your pelvic muscles. You can try Keggel exercises to improve on it. You should avoid lifting heavy weights to avoid developing a vault prolapse. You should go for a urine routine test, and also a culture sensitivity of the urine sample.

Does your baby gave other symptoms like cough, diarrhea, vomitus? Hoe many days is he with high temperature? It might be only a viral cause that doesn't need antibiotics but only symptomatic treatments which mean, only temperature control. But to be sure I recommend you to see a doctor in order to do a total control, in order to rule out all the other causes. As for the temperature antipiretics, the medicaments for the temperature, are given only if temperature is above 38 and is given Tylenol. Don't except temperature ti follow down within 5 minutes, so check your baby temperature after 30 minutes. Keep it with cold compresse and keep him not covered with light clothes in order for temperature to fall. You can give Tylenol only 4 times a day, so every 6 hours. If temperature rises above 39 use ibuprofen syrup. Ibuprofen is given 3 times a day only, every 8 hours. If it's a viral cause, as I said before it doesn't need antibiotics. If temperature continue more than 5 days, do a total blood count and biochemical test. Keep your baby hydrated with soups and water, because he loses water through sweating.I hope this will help you.

What's wrong with me?I'm 20 years old, female, and healthy.","Doctor":"Hi ! Probably you had a food poisoning with your dinner. This gives rise to vomiting and abdominal cramps associated with loose motions. The act of vomiting causes a valsalva manoever which results in muffled or imparined hearing in your ear. Post vomiting when you got up suddenly, the blood circulation could not cope with the sudden change in posture and due to vaso-dilatation, blood supply to brain  became less which resulted in a transient black out.

I feel that your baby is having cow's milk protein allergy. Unusually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age.My suggestions for you -1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds.3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4. If you feel your feeds alone are inadequate for the baby, then Zerolac is the only option till 6 months age.I request you to keep me posted about the recovery of the baby and follow of the case.Regards – Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hello, my son woke up in the morning with a little bit of blood on his sheet.

This can occur in children as their immunity is still developing.I recommend:- adequate hydration. keep giving him sips of water throughout the day. he should pass light urine atleast 5 times a  day. you may give soup, rice water, milk, tender coconut water, butter milk (room temperature). Please give him smaller but more frequent and bland, easily digestible meals.- fever meds appropriate for his weight, preferably paracetamol.- if he complain of throat pain or is unable to drink or eat, or fever persists more than 38.5 for 2 days, see his pediatrician for treatment with appropriate antibiotics.- steam inhalations ( luke warm baths - prefill bathroom with steam by running the hot water and closing the windows). keep him in there for 10 minutes. bathe him in luke warm water. this helps reduce temperature and loosen secretions.hydration is vital. please make sure of that.If he is weak or looks lethargic, follow your instincts and see a doctor right away.Hope this helps. hope he gets better soon."},{"Patient":"Hi I have a 1 month old daughter & she was diagnosed with reflux since day4.

There are certainly alternative management therapies in allopathy now-a-days. Medicine has advanced a lot and not asthma is 100% controllable.2. Inhalers are the newest management strategies for this. If I were your paediatrician I would have suggested the use of Budecort metered dose inhaler (100mcg) 2 puffs twice a day through a spacer and this is for regular use for 8 weeks. Another metered dose inhaler is Levolin and this can used as rescue therapy whenever the kid is having severe cough in spite of regular usage of Budecort. The technique is very important and very crucial for the drug to be delivered correctly to the lungs. Regularity of medicine usage also matters a lot. So do not discontinue abruptly after you notice some improvement. The technique of administering an inhaler using a spacer has to be taught to you by your doctor and these are prescription medicines. So I suggest you consult your paediatrician for this.3. Triggers can be environmental changes/ dust/ talcum powder/ seasonal changes/ un-cleaned a/c vents/ cold weather etc....we can specifically say this is the cause - unless we observe the kid closely - best person is the parent.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.For cold you can use Cetrizine at 0.25mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days.For nasal block, plain saline nasal drops will do, every 4-6th hourly to relive nasal congestion.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

Is this normal range for a 10 yr old?","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my 4 year old daughter had her adenoids removed 1 year back. she now has a constant cold for last 3 months and discharge mostly from the right nose.

This is one viral illness among all other exanthemas which can cause fever followed by rash over palms and soles. It is a self-limiting disorder and itching can be really worrisome.

You can use Hydroxyzine at 1-2mg/kg/dose (Maximum 10mg) every 6th to 8th hourly for 7 days.This can even cause some peeling of skin in the next 4-6 weeks and do not worry about it.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"I'm 9 Weeks pregnant and last 2 days my sickness was severe throwing up and yesterday I got sharp(pinching) pain in right abdomen which comes and go every now and then but not constant. So we went to GP where she diagnosed tender in right abdomen and referred to A&E. we rushed to A&E where they took Ultra Scan and confirmed baby is fine in uterus and they are getting heart beat but they said there is tender in right abdomen and referred to surgeon assuming appendicitis. When Surgeon did the diagnosis where I didn't get any pain during that time, even he asked me to cough, bend my legs still didn't get pain so he asked us to go home saying that it is not clinically appendicitis. But if you see the symptoms for appendicitis I have vomiting, tiredness, gastric problem, right abdomen pain comes and go and finally it subsidized now. So now I'm confused as I don't want to get unnoticed on any infection really worried whether is it normal during pregnancy or shall i need to have second opinion on this. On the blood test everything is normal abd teh surgeon told me white cells are little more than normal but he didn't worry about that, what he says his he didn't see any pain when he press the right abdomen so he asked us to come back in case if pain continues. Tell me what I should do now. Thanks for your time.","Doctor":"Hi! Your concern about the pain is justified. The symptoms what you have mentioned can be due to many conditions, common ones being a urinary tract infection, a small calculi in the ureter on the right side, a pelvic infection, simple collitis, and of course an attack of appendicitis. Your ultrasound has excluded an ectopic pregnancy. You should go for a urine test for infection. Ultrasound sometimes can not detect a small calculi. You have to get yourself examined by your gynaecologist for excluding pelvic infection. However, if you do not have any pain now, the possible mild attack of appendicitis might have subsided of its own or it might not have been clear due to the position of appendix which may vary during pregnancy. I would suggest you to see your surgeon again immediately if the pain returns. Good luck."},{"Patient":"Hi, my 9 year old son is running a fever of 103 degree.

As per your symptoms,its urinary tract infection with vaginal candidiasis.I would advise to get her urine routine examination done from lab. If there is infection (pus cells in urine) go for urine culture and start syp. ciprofloxacin 250 mg/5 ml (6 ml twice daily for 1 week) along with cranberry juice twice daily. Also give her plenty of fluids like fresh fruit juices and plain water to make her urine output atleast 1.5 to 2 litres/day and the urine colour should be clear. Get her renal scan (ultrasound KUB)done if the infection is positive in urine.Pomegranate juice is also helpful in relieving pain due to urinary tract infection.For vaginal infection,canesten is good enough but you can also try fusidic acid and syp. VERMOX (mebendazole) 5 ml twice daily for 3 days because sometimes the itching and redness is due to pinworm infection that also causes Urinary infection.Avid constipation by giving high fiber diet and fluids.Avoid tight clothing.Wipe from front to back,not back to front after pee.Hope it will help.Wishing your child good health :-)"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, I am writing on behalf of my daughter.

She has had a cscan, Colonoscopy, endoscopy, and the blood workup she had was very extensive, but to no avail. Her doctor doesn t see anything in any of her tests. She did say that her pancreas showed enzymes showed elevation. Her doctor is scheduling an Upper GI soon. She on her own made a dermatology appt.

YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hi...by what you say I feel that your child is having recurrent viral illness only. It is very common in this age. I will explain you how a viral illness behaves so that you can be more comfortable.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Regarding tonsils, unless it is causing Obstructive sleep symptoms it need not be removed.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my son is 4 years old and i didn t know that my mother in law had alendronate sodium pills just laying out and he got ahold of them and told me he put one in his mouth but spit it out right away because it tasted nasty...is he okay or should i take him to the hospital? please respond as soon as possible very worried mother!!!!","Doctor":"hello dear!As your history suggest,he took a bit of a tablet and threw that too because of the taste.I think i completely safe in this aspect.i dont think there is any need of taking him to the hospital.

It feels heartbroken to see your child in misery.I would advise you to make a diet chart based on her caloric requirement according to her current weight and considering the ideal weight at this age. Suppose at this age,she should have a weightof atleast 35 kg,which i am sureshe wontbe.so you should start with ATLEAST 60% of the required calories of this weight that is 1800 calories (60% would be around 1000 calories)i am making a sample of diet chart which you can give to her and gradually increasing calories.starting from 8 am in the morning give her whole egg in the form of a puree made with poring egg in about 5 ounces of boiled  milk and gradually stirring with a whisk.it will be like a custard.add in 2 teaspoons of sugar and a drop of vanilla essence for flavorit will provide around 220 calories.at 10 am you can give chicken stock made with about a 100 gm of chicken in water with selected spices like black pepper or paprika and salt,whichever she likes.it will provide around 150 caloriessave the meat of chicken and blend it with a cup of wheat cereal with a little stock if remaining)it will provide around 250 calories.At 12 noon you can give about a cup of rice pudding made with 4-5 ounces of boiled rice and 8-10 ounces of milk with added sugar if she likes and a cardamom to enhance the flavor.It will provide around 200-250 calories.at 2 pm you can give her mashed veggies like a mashed potato medium sized..you can also grill with butter and sprinkle some salt and then mesh it with chicken stock or milk or anything you like.It will provide around 150 calories and with added butter and stock around 250-300 calories.At 4 pm repeat the wheat and chicken stock (wheat cereal/porridge is high in fiber to avoid constipation).At 6 pm give her banana shake..2 bananas in 5-6 ounces of milk, it will provide around 200 calories.At 8 pm give her lentil soup (about a 100 grams) with selected spices. it will provide around 250 calories in almost a cup of 5-6 ounces.At 10 pm repeat rice puddingAt 12 midnight give her warm milk about 5-6 ounces with a tablespoon of olive oil. It will enhance the calories and relieve constipation.Hope it will help.You can always make variations in the diet with the choice of ingredients.Wishing your child good health :-)"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have a 1 year old baby.

All this is caused by high acid secretion which is found in gastritis, GERD or hiatus hernia. These disorders can cause such difficulties and you should do gastroscopy to evaluate this. Symptoms that are experienced in such conditions are pain and tightness in upper stomach, bloating, breathing difficulties, heartburn, feeling of lump and sore in throat, gurgling sound in throat, fatigue and loss of apetite. Symptoms are aggravated after meal, long sitting, leaning forward,stress and anxiety. In the beginning this is treated by changing dietary habbits. You should avoid alcohol,coffee,smoking,fats and fast food, carbonated drinks and eat more milk and milk products, fruit and vegetables,boiled food and natural beverages and teas. 1 hour after meal you should not sit or lay.

One week ago he started complaining of GI pain (Prior to the pain one week ago a couple of times in the week prior he stated he did not feel good). He eventually fell asleep and woke up the next day with a temp of 103. The fever continued at 104 or higher for 3 straight days. No other symptoms present like n/v, diarrhea, cough, sore throat etc. On Monday morning the fever broke and he vomited 1-2 times.

As you mentioned 'pediatrician' I will take his age below 14 years. The first thing is Miralax is not recommended in children. The second thing is it is contraindicated in a case of unknown origin of abdominal pain. So please stop giving laxatives to the baby until the cause for abdominal pain is ruled out. The symptoms are matching with the acute abdomen which could be intestinal obstruction. If it is infected by the bacteria it results in the fever and vomiting manifestations. An x-ray of the abdomen and ultrasonogram of the abdomen will give a clue for the diagnosis. Please take your son to a surgeon who will manage the case and will give a right treatment.

We finally took her to the hospital and they told us she has the Flu. They perscribed Tamiflu however advised that it may not work because it had to be administered 48hrs after the first symptoms.It is now Wednesday and she continues to have high fevers of 100 in addition to stomach pains, coughing, sneezing, runny nose and eyes, and purpulish lips? Is this the common flu? Should i take her to the hospital again?","Doctor":"I have gone through your question and understand your concern. It would have been more easy for me if you have mentioned age of child and all the advised treatment.However the symptoms described are compatible with diagnosis of Flu. Usually the symptoms severity last for first week while fatigue can last longer. Yes, best results of Tamiflu are achieved if given within 48 hours of onset of disease.  Complications are common in very young children and elderly. But it should be continued as prescribed by your physician. I would advise to start Paracetamol as it diminishes the severity of symptoms. But the mainstay of treatment is rest, plenty of fluids and avoid contact with other people if possible. If the symptoms worsen, or are prolonged than a week than its necessary to  visit the hospital again. You child give yearly flu vaccine to your child to prevent this problem again.

My doctor had prescibed to give 5 drops in the morning and evening . Is it 5 drops each time or maximum of 10 drops a day ? Please help me ...","Doctor":"Hello, I have read your question.Colimex drops are usually advised for abdominal colic/discomfort in newborn child. I would not suggest to continue it on regular basis. If your child remains symptom free after stopping the drug, It should be discontinued. In about 80 % of patients, single daily dose of 5 drops suffices. But if your child has no symptoms, Kindly stop it.Regards"},{"Patient":"hi I have a family member that is in his late 70s who went in yesterday . he has a hernia that has not had treatment over a year he would not go to the doctor he was told today he will have to get surgery to get it removed he is not very well any way will he live and how long will he take to recover if  he dose live ?","Doctor":"Hi ! You general condition of your family member is not very clear from the above. If the pre anesthetic check up has cleared him for surgery, he should undergo surgery for a hernia as it might give him more trouble without notice any time. Now a days, anesthesia and surgery have undergone a lot of improvement in terms of lowering the risks of both.

I have taken her for an MRI but it came back clear. >My eye specilist now doesnt know whats going on. Please can you give me some answers. I cant go on thinking my child is blind.","Doctor":"Hello, I have read your question and understand your concerns. At 3 months of age, infants are described as “hatching” socially, becoming interested in a wider world. During feeding, infants no longer focus exclusively on the mother, but become distracted. In the mother's arms, the infant may literally turn around, preferring to face outward. Although each baby develops in her own individual way and at her own rate, failure to reach certain milestones may signal medical or developmental problems requiring special attention. If you notice any of the following warning signs in your infant at this age, discuss them with your pediatrician.Doesn’t seem to respond to loud soundsDoesn’t notice her hands by two monthsDoesn’t smile at the sound of your voice by two monthsDoesn’t follow moving objects with her eyes by two to three monthsDoesn’t grasp and hold objects by three monthsDoesn’t smile at people by three monthsCannot support her head well at three monthsDoesn’t reach for and grasp toys by three to four monthsDoesn’t babble by three to four monthsDoesn’t bring objects to her mouth by four monthsHas trouble moving one or both eyes in all directionsCrosses her eyes most of the time (Occasional crossing of the eyes is normal in these first months.)Doesn’t pay attention to new faces, or seems very frightened by new faces or surroundingsMy opinion would be to consult your Pediatrician who would further advise after examining the child."},{"Patient":"Good Morning my daughter is 6 months teething and weaning.

Bright yellow color of stool is normal in a child.*As far as number of stools is concerned five times is normal till she passes urine normally and take feed properly. If she passes less urine and refused to take food again and again then it is a matter of concern and then you can consult a nearby pediatrician.*You can add foods like curd, banana, apple etc. in her diet as all will be digested easily. Curd is a good source of intestinal friendly bacteria and will also help in maintaining intestinal motility.*I hope you find my answer helpful.Thank you."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ? Please type your query here...hello doc. my son is 13 months old and weighs 9 kg. he looks quite weak and underweight. Can u please suggest something to make him gain weight. He is an active baby otherwise.","Doctor":"Hi.... first of all be reassured that a kid weighing 9kg by 13 months is within appropriate range.I take this opportunity to tell you certain scientific facts and relieve your distress -1. An active is a well kid even if she/ he is not eating well.2. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone.3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day.4. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.5. I suggest you not to use appetite stimulants on long run as they may cause drowsiness.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my baby is four months old she is suffering from loose motion 4 times a day i have already visited two doctors to get rid of loose motion but still it is not controllable she is having normal urination some people says due to gum formation i have given following medicines enterogermina, OF than azithral what to do doctor please suggest????","Doctor":"Hello,         I just read your query. If baby is having mother's milk then usually 6 to 8 stools(whether solid or semi solid) are considered normal as long as baby passes urine normally and feeds normally. Because loose motion causes dehydration in baby and less urination and refusal to take feed are common symptoms of that. * Gum formation has nothing to do with loose motions.* As your baby is 4 month old now, you can add foods like curd, banana, apple to the diet of your baby because they will help in making solid stool and curd is a good source of intestinal friendly bacterias which will help in maintaining normal intestinal movements. Start from small quantity. * If you give baby milk other than yours then do maintain hygiene. Boil bottle and nipple before use and change nipple every 7 to 10 days.* So do not worry about the number of stools baby passed a day and no need to give medication as long as he is not dehydrated or have other symptoms of infection( fever etc.).* I hope you find my answer useful.Thank you."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

You have not mentioned about the dietary habit of your child. See that she eats more roughage and drinks adequate amount of water. It is seen that one tea spoonful of honey daily does wonders in constipation and impaction in youngsters. You should avoid giving her fast foods which may cause constipation.

She hasn;t eaten anything, gave her apple juice and some electrolite. Need to know how to stop her loose motions. Also gave her one dose of Ondem as she was vomitting and not keeping the fluid inside","Doctor":"Hello,Viral gastroenteritis is the most likely possibility although you forgot to mention the age of the baby. As viral gastroenteritis damages the gastrointestinal mucosa, it takes time to heal, and so does diarrhea needs time to settle. Apple juices, cola drinks, and other hyperosmolar fluids should be avoided as these might aggravate diarrhea.My concern is repeated vomiting which might lead to dehydration in the kid. Ondem ( dose 0.2 mg/kg/dose) is good if she retains it. Diet should be continued, extra fluids in the form of low osmolarity ORS are beneficial if the age is more than six months. Probiotics (Lactobacillus GG) can be given once daily for seven days. Once vomiting has settled, Zinc supplementation for fourteen days should be given. However, if the child vomits everything, is dehydrated, anxious or drowsy, he or she should be taken to hospital for IV fluids management.Hope I have answered your query.

But as you have described pain in lower back and abdomen, child might have Urinary tract infection. As temperature is high, sponging or shower can be given again. Kindly give proper dose of tylenol according to weight of child (10mg/kg/dose) and repeat it after 8 hours.

First of all be sure that blood in stools has nothing to do with vaccination or flu. Yes its always an alarming sign though.The foremost possibility in a well doing infant like yours is ingestion of blood from cracks around nursing mother's nipple or bleed from infant's nasophrangeal tract.

These symptoms can be related to your bladder or ureter. If you have urine retention it would cause lower abdominal and inguinal area.You should visit urologist because there can be prostate enlargement if you are male or pelvic organs disorders if you are a female. YOu should drink lot of water and urologic teas to provoke urination. ALso you should consider gallbladder disorder so do abdominal ultrasound to evaluate this.

So that her fever was go down. Today also after giving paracetamol her fever is still 99. Should I give her paracetamol or mefenamic acid?","Doctor":"Hello, I understand your concern over the health condition of your baby. First of all, are there any other symptoms apart from fever? Like cough/ cold/ recent infection? If yes kindly mention the details. It's good that you consulted a doctor for this rather than waiting or just giving OTC drugs. In children, it's very important to give proper medical attention on time or else their condition gets bad over the time.      The paracetamol will help to bring the fever down but it's going to take time at least few days. Along with the paracetamol, the baby needs antibiotics treatment as well. Syrup Myclav would be a good option. For the proper dosage as per the baby's weight, I would suggest you consult a pediatrician soon.You have not given details regarding the baby's weight so it's better to let a pediatrician examine the baby in person and advise you proper dosage of the medicine I suggested. As children are very sensitive to anything, even the medicines they are given. So the best I can suggest you is visit a pediatrician. If there is need of any other medicines or advice as per the child's condition, that shall be taken care of better.    For now, as per the doctor's advice give the baby paracetamol for fever but do not wait longer for making an appointment with a pediatrician. Also keep the baby away from cold and things that are cold. Make sure environment around the baby is warm, clean. It will take few days to get the fever down completely so don't worry about it. Proper treatment will help the baby to recover quickly. Hope this helps. If you have any further queries feel free to contact.

Your history suggests that you might have torn some muscle fibres and might have developed a hematoma (collection of blood) in the are which you think is for appendix. This will give rise to the pain while coughing and sneezing. You may take some anti inflammatory tabtets for the pain and swelling which will gradullay subside. See your doctor if the swelling increases. However, one should not be very much confident of this diagnosis and appendicitis should be kept at the back of one's mind as a coincidental pathology.

I ve had lower abdominal pains which have worsened over the past three months. I was in hospital six months ago with an infection which was diagnosed as a sizeable cyst of 4inches on my left ovary but nothing was done and I wasn t given a follow up appointment. Since then, a similar pain has developed but worse on my right side which some days leaves me doubled over and a pain in my lower back started about a month ago. The pain in my left side is more of a dull ache which never goes away but the pain in my right sometimes is a sharp, burning pain. Some days it feels like extreme period pains but I never used to suffer during that time and now I m sometimes bedridden for a couple of days. I m not sure if its linked. I finally plucked up the courage three weeks ago to go and see a doctor who took blood tests. I d been told to go back this morning for my results. Unfortunately, the original lady doctor I d seen has since left the surgery and my appointment this morning was with a male doctor. He told me my levels of CA125 were 67 and although slightly elevated, it was nothing to worry about. He has arranged for a pelvic ultrasound in three weeks. However, he has ruled it out as anything to do with my ovaries and is suggesting that because of the pain in my back, it could be something called Scoliosis . He has also referred me to a musculoskeletal Clinic for an assesment. I ve never had any problems with my back previously. I can t see how this can explain the severe pains I m having and why this wasn t explored further when I was in hospital. I also can t find anything on the internet about what the level of CA125 should be? Should I get a second opinion or just wait for three weeks till my ultrasound? I d refrained from getting worried or reading anything on the internet till just now because what the doctor said, doesn t make sense. Now I m concerned that some of the symptoms of ovarian cancer are symptoms I ve had over the past couple of months. I m 31 yrs old and have never had children. I am asthmatic though and my recent cervical smear came back clear as did the other blood tests they did for thyroids etc. I m sure though that after I d told the doctor how I was feeling he would ve mentioned it as a possibility but he didn t mention it at all. Any advice you can offer me would be greatly appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM. It usually very difficult to determine is ovarian cyst malignant or benign. These cysts are most commonly benign and it is recommended to do frequent check ups and evaliat dynamics of growing. Malignancies grow much faster and infiltrate surroundsing tissues. There is really no better approach then it was recommended in your case. There is a possiblity of laparoscopic biopsy but it is invasive. I suggest to do this ultrasounds and if something suspicous is founds then it can be easily removed. CA125 is confusing many woman.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do.

They usually occur form 6 months to 6 years of age and usually are self limiting after 6 years of age. They usually do not leave any focal neurological deficits also. Rather than the height of the temperature the rapidity of rise of temperature is more important.In general, antiepileptic therapy, continuous or intermittent, is not recommended for children with 1 or more simple febrile seizures. Parents should be counseled about the relative risks of recurrence of febrile seizures and recurrence of epilepsy, educated on how to handle a seizure acutely, and given emotional support.If the seizure lasts for longer than 5 min, buccal or intranasal midazolam (Available as Midacip Nasal spray) may be used and is often preferred by parents.If the parents are very anxious concerning their child’s seizures, intermittent oral diazepam (0.33 mg/kg every 8 hr during fever) or intermittent rectal diazepam (0.5 mg/kg administered as a rectal suppository every 8 hr), can be given during febrile illnesses. Such therapies help reduce, but do not eliminate, the risks of recurrence of febrile seizures.Regards – Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi, my 5 month old nephew has developed several large boils all over his body.

Good luck."},{"Patient":"my son is 4 years old he catches cold frequently. he starts vomittuing. he starts wheezing. it is occuring from last 1 month doctors gave him antibiotics and levolin inhaler. it happened thrice in a month. doctor is recommending 6 months inhaler couse. should i go for it?","Doctor":"hello, It's good that for these complains you consulted a doctor. As per the history the child has already been given course of antibiotics and antiinflammatory medicine  for the  complains. Is there any history of same complaints in family?For how long the kid is having these problems? How many times the same thing happened?Is the kid allergic to anything? From when did this start to occur if it has occured before?       As it's over a month already and the kid is still not relieved, that's why giving inhaler won't cause any harm if given as per your doctor's advise.        It's safe and usually used for long duration as per the doctor's advice. But if you have doubts it's always better to talk about it to the doctor that is treating the child. Because he/she has examined the child in person and knows better about current situtaion of the kid.        Make sure you do not let the child get exposed to cold. Do not give anything that is cold to eat or avoid ice creams. Do not give anything directly to eat which is taken out from fridge, even water. Make sure the temperature is normal when the kid is eating or drinking anything.          I would suggest you talk to your doctor about it. And continue the treatment. Or a second opinion is fine if you are worried so much as the issue is related to the kid and thats absolutely fine so that you won't have any doubts while continuing the treatment for it. Hope this helped.If you have any further queries feel free to contact. stay healthy."},{"Patient":"Hi Doc. My 3week old baby has rashes all over his face. And now it starting to get down his chest. He also has it on his head and the back of his neck and ears. The thing that worries me is that they are all tiny and few days ago, those red rashes had turned into white ones.

For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do.

I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.For cold you can use Cetrizine at 0.25mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days.For nasal block, plain saline nasal drops will do, every 4-6th hourly to relive nasal congestion.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

Thank you for writing!Nocturnal enuresis, also called bedwetting, is involuntary urination while asleep after the age at which bladder control usually occurs. Most bedwetting is a developmental delay—not an emotional problem or physical illness. Only a small percentage (5% to 10%) of bedwetting cases are caused by specific medical situations. Bedwetting is frequently associated with a family history of the condition. Treatments range from behavioral-based options such as bedwetting alarms, to medication such as hormone replacement, and even surgery such as urethral enlargement. Since most bedwetting is simply a developmental delay, most treatment plans aim to protect or improve self-esteem.[1] Bedwetting children and adults can suffer emotional stress or psychological injury if they feel shamed by the condition. Treatment guidelines recommend that the physician counsel the parents, warning about psychological damage caused by pressure, shaming, or punishment for a condition children cannot control. Motivational therapy in nocturnal enuresis mainly involves parent and child education. Guilt should be allayed by providing facts. Fluids should be restricted 2 hours prior to bed. The child should be encouraged to empty the bladder completely prior to going to bed. Positive reinforcement can be initiated by setting up a diary or chart to monitor progress and establishing a system to reward the child for each night that he or she is dry. The child should participate in morning cleanup as a natural, nonpunitive consequence of wetting. This method is particularly helpful in younger children (Bedwetting alarms: Physicians also frequently suggest bedwetting alarms which sound a loud tone when they sense moisture. This can help condition the child to wake at the sensation of a full bladder. These alarms are considered effective, with study participants being 13 times more likely to become dry at night. There is a 29% to 69% relapse rate, however, so the treatment may need to be repeated. But before this better see a doctor in order to rule out the medical conditions that can cause this. Thank you.

Pregnancy test revealed i wasnt pregnant sfter doing snout 10 of them When I eat little my stomach feels full and is extremely bloated , constant aching stomach until I lay down.

These disorders can cause such difficulties and you should do gastroscopy to evaluate this.

Symptoms are aggravated after meal, long sitting, leaning forward,stress and anxiety. In the beginning this is treated by changing dietary habbits. You should avoid alcohol,coffee,smoking,fats and fast food, carbonated drinks and eat more milk and milk products, fruit and vegetables,boiled food and natural beverages and teas. 1 hour after meal you should not sit or lay.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do. Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridges & soups.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

It is a very painful almost unbearable pain that occurs in my abdominal area. I went to a Gastroenterologist and had an endoscopy but that came up clean. Blood results also came up clean. However this must be something! The pain is sometimes so great that I need to go to the E.R. I think that it has a lot to do with gas build up in my abdominal area. If I do not eat at the exact time that I am hungry my stomach fills up with gas and I become full. However if I eat my stomach would still sometimes fill up with gas. Especially during times of high stress/anxiety such as exam time. My most recent attack was two days ago on an airplane. The pain was localized in my top abdominal and was very severe lasting for about 1 hour after I ate some sour candies. Could this be gallstones?","Doctor":"Hi welcome to health care magic forum. Thanks for calling H.C.M.Forum. You are having the pain in the upper middle part of the stomach. It appears to be the gastric irritation, due to peptic ulcer, or gastric  irritation. or may be gallbladder pain, or pancreas pain. i advise you to go to the gastro enterologist as a follow up visit. You may have to get gastroscopy, M.R.I, besides other routine tests for confirmation. I advise you some diet recommendations as avoid taking spices, junk foods, and oily foods to avoid gastric irritation. Practice yoga, meditation, reading magazines, and hearing music to avoid stress and anxiety, and hence reflex gastric irritation. Wishing for a quick and complete recovery .

He does not have a fever and his energy level if normal","Doctor":"Hello,Children are very sensitive to any small change in weather (like cold) or environment around them. As they are in the process of developing immunity to many things. The kid got a cough and cold which is manageable as you said but still, it needs proper treatment or else chances of recurrence increase. So make sure you are giving medicines as per your doctor's advice for a cough and cold. Because sometimes it seems like a cough and cold is gone or suppressed for some time, but if it is treated insufficiently, then it comes back again.Here is syrup that can be given for now it will provide some relief-Allegra(suspension)- As per the weight of the kid (do consult a pediatrician in person for proper dosage according to the weight of your kid you have not mentioned the weight here as its necessary to calculate the dosage)About the rash, does the child has any known allergy to any food or substance? Any family history of allergy to some substance or food or medicine? It has happened for the first time or any similar incidence happened previously. As the rashes are very itchy, check if the child has been bitten by some insect that went unnoticed and that resulted in the appearance of rashes. If it's an allergic reaction to anything like food or some chemical or some insect bite, then I would suggest you take the child to the emergency room as soon as possible. So that immediate medical attention will be provided. It will help to reduce the uneasy feeling and also further complications can be avoided. Always seek medical help for any illness in kids even if you can deal with it at home. Also, make sure the child is receiving all the vaccines that he or she should be receiving as per the regular vaccination schedule up to the age of 10-12.

It is standard for the females in our family to develop early ( I got my first period just after turning 11 and by that time I had full size breasts) my daughter has been developing breasts for around 6 - 8 months now and is starting to notice a slight size difference between them already. We have spoken to local woman s health doctors who suspect she is about to start menstruating which makes perfect sense given the family history but since I didn t have cramping or any other warning signs when I got mine ( or at least none that I can recall ), We would like to know how long it normally takes from when the symptoms start to when the periods start. Does it take weeks? Months? and is there anything I can do for her or get for her to make this transition as comfortable for her as possible? She keeps pads and spare underwear with her at all times (discretely of course) and I am going to get her a hot water bottle this week along with anything else you think would be helpful. I have made sure she knows everything she could possibly want or need to know so she has no shortage of information, love and support. Thank you for taking the time to read this and we appreciate any advice you may have for us.","Doctor":"HelloAccording to the given family history,yes she is about to menstruate and these symptoms are perfectly normal.its a normal physiology.Dnt get tense over minor issues.This abdominal cramping is very much normal and pain intensity varies from person to person.At times its different for a daughter from her mother,at times the schedule and the pattern differs in all daughters of the same mother,its physiological variation that defines a person's individuality.Pain threshold is also different among different person.What you can do to relieve the pain is by warm water bottle to place on tummy where it hurts. It causes decrese in spasm of the uterus and relieves the pain and 1 tablespoon honey in warm water to drink.It has soothing effect and relieves the pain too.I dnt want to recommend pain killers like Ibuprofen as medicines have their own side effecfs.Hope it will help"},{"Patient":"My son is 11 years, 3 months old.

From an elucidate history you have provided, this looks to be Endometriosis.

It has been waking me up in the middle of the night. I experienced a stomach ache after smooking hookah and shortly after bubbling and sharp pains in the right side ofmy stomach. What do you think I have? I am worried it is an apendicidous but I have not thrown up and I dont have a fever","Doctor":"Hi ! Did you some food from outside along with smooking hookah ? The chronic pain could be due to some kind of colitis. Other possibility is a silent urinary tract infection. Go for a urine and stool test. Also go for routine blood tests like hb, DC, TLC, ESR. Go for an ultrasound if your family doctor advises for it. Appendicitis is a clinical diagnosis on examining the patient on the spot, and so can not be judged now even though it could be a possibility (recurrent appendicitis). I would suggest you to report to your doctor for a clinical examination if it continues.

HE HAS BEEN TO DOCTOR AFTER DOCTOR AND SPECIALIST AFTER SPECIALIST..........WE HONESTLY DO NOT KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO???? MY CHILD EATS TYLENOL AND IBPROUFREN LIKE CANDY.","Doctor":"Hello,         I just read your query.* See in babies constant fever may have many reasons. You did not mention here that have you ever performed any blood investigation and urine examination. *Because urinary tract infection is one of the most common cause in babies behind fever.* In blood examination you can ask your doctor about Total leucocyte count( if it is raised it will indicate about infection in body), CRP(it will also indicate acute infection), widal test( for typhoid). If you already performed all tests and all are within normal limit.*Then I would advice you to go for an ayurvedic medicine named Giloy ( tinospora cordifolia), you can take fresh giloy if it is available nearby you and make juice of its stem and give 5ml of its juice twice a day with water to your baby. If your baby does not find its taste good then you can add sugar or honey in it. If fresh giloy is not available then take dry giloy. Add some giloy in one glass of water and  half water remains, then you can give it to your baby in two parts. Giloy is very helpful in curing fever.* Whenever fever is there, do sponging with fresh water. Ice water sometimes cause shivering in baby, so do whole body sponging with fresh water for 5 to 10 minutes as it will also help in lowering fever *Give him fresh fruits and vegetables, juice, soups, liquid and semi solid diet as in fever all these things are easy to digest.* I hope you are satisfied with my answer and find it helpful.  Thank you."},{"Patient":"my 5 years old grandson started out with a small growth on left testicle and now I noticed that it has gotten larger and more growth has start appearing on the rest of his testicles.

He is vomiting for about 5 days now (once a day) and his diapers is something out of this world. I can see he s got a runny tummy and he s stomach is also making noices. He s not eating and drinking as spontaneously as before, but is also not showing that he is feeling ill. He is busy teething and at first I thought that that is the explantion for abovementioned, but there is a tummy bug doing the rounds and I can only get to a docter tommorrow. Please advise. Regards Adel","Doctor":"Hello Mam,                   I just read your query. The diarrohea and vomitting in a child are indicating gastro intestinal infection. The infection may be viral or bacterial, but as he has not been suffering from fever or other symptoms, chances of bacterial infection are less.* As you mentioned about teething , while teething in gums of baby irritation and itching occurs, to get rid of that baby usually took some hard material and start chewing them, and may be its your teether. As these may cause infection. Teether if not cleaned properly or has not been changed from quite long time might cause stomach infection.* So first of all take care about things which your baby put in his mouth.*In diarrhoea and vomiting prefer liquid and semi solid diet. As diarrhoea and vomiting both may cause dehydration and salt loss. So give your baby apple, banana as both these will help in binding of stool. You can give him juice of apple,pomegranate.  You can give him boiled rice or boiled lentils after mashing or can give boiled rice and lentils together. But dont force your baby to have too much of anything. Give him small frequent meals as it will compensate his energy requirement. Curd is a good source of probiotics and will also help in stool binding and normal intestinal movement. You can also give it to your baby.Reduce the amount of milk as it will also worsen the problem.* If you are using any gel for gums then keep on using it. If you dont have any then take honey and after cleaning your hand properly, rub some amount of honey on gums of your baby twice or thrice a day as it will reduce irritation of gums upto some extent.* If you feel he has fever then check it on,if its around 100 degree F or more then you can give him paracetamol syrup.* Keep an eye on his urine output. Less urine might indicate dehydration.* Try all the above mentioned things and you will feel positive results. * I hope you are satisfied with my answer.                       Thank you."},{"Patient":"My 10 year old granddaughter is complaining about pain in her buttock cheeks that has lasted for the last couple of days.

We have a sterilizer for bottles and distilled water for her milk.","Doctor":"Hello Mam,               I just read your query. The main cause for amoebiasis is contaminated food and water. Amoebiasis is most commonly caused by entamoeba histolytica. *As you have mentioned that the infection re occurs in your daughter, and it usually transmitted through fecal oral route. The reason behind this might be that sometimes amoeba when enters in body and took time to eradicate and in your daughter there might be chances that it was not eradicated completely and was present in her intestinal tract and spread again through fecal oral route. Other reason can be inappropriate sanitary measure.* To help prevent spread of infection again and again adopt some preventive measures as medicine you are already giving to her:*Wash hands thoroughly with soap and hot running water for atleast 10 to 15 seconds after going to toilet or changing baby's diaper and before handling food.*Clean bathroom and toilet seats and taps regularly.*Avoid sharing of towels to help prevent infection.*Avoid using raw vegetables.*Boil water if you use water in other food items.*Use glass bottles in place of plastic bottles as glass bottles are better while preventing any infection. Try to change nipples of bottles after 7 to 10 days. Boil bottle and nipple every time before use as it would be more helpful than alone using steriliser.*As your daughter is already 9 months old then you can try giving her milk and other liquids with the help of sipper and can try giving her with the help of spoon as this will also help her because bottle feeding is more prone to infection. * Try all these preventive measures and you will soon feel positive results.* I hope you are satisfied with my answer.

Thanks for posting your query here. The left lower abdominal pain in your case suggests a renal colic. Renal colic is presence of stones in the kidney pathway. You have not mentioned your age and what sort of tests conducted. The stones while passing through the passage will cause acute pain. If the diameter of the stone is less than 3mm they will be passed out in the urine without any difficulty. If the size is more than 5mm it causes obstruction and dilatation of the structures called hydronephrosis. This can be treated by ECSWL-extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy or lithotomy. The feeling to belch is due to the referred pain caused by the renal colic. Sometimes this will be associated with nausea and vomiting also. An x-ray of KUB-kidney, ureter, and bladder, or an ultrasonogram of the pelvis will give you a clue of the diagnosis. An other condition acute pancreatitis could be a reason for your pain. A thorough blood check and ultrasonogram will give the exact picture.

We can not ignore this kind of chronic abdominal pain which requires medications every four hours. Some history if you consume any alcoholic beverages would have been helpful. However, the site of your pain points more towards pathology in the stomach/duodenum like hyperacidity causing ulceration, which has penetrated and might be causing inflammation of organs in the back like pancreas. However, even though all these points to an abdominal problem, you should also get your cardiovascular status checked by a cardiologist specially when your blood pressure has gone up.

She was on singulair and seretide. She was a skinny baby and as she grew we noticed her stomach got larger. She started putting on alot of weight in spite of us being a healthy eating family, who generally avoid too many refined foods and junk food. She outgre her asthma by the age of 7 and has become a lot more active, being a competent swimmer, she does tai kwon do, plays tennis and also did gymnastics last year. She also does a bit of ocean kayaking with us. Our concern is that she has a very solid feel to her when we pick her up (lift her- I have not been able to pick her up since she was about 5), her tummy is still very overweight and she does not lose weight in spite of her exercise. She does not raid the cupboards at home or the fridge, drinks good quantities of water, loves fruit and eats everything that we prepare.I have cut back on her portions as well, watch her sugar and salt intake and she makes good choices as well most of the time. A nurse at a childrens health programme mentioned that it was probably a shot in the dark, but that we investigate cushings syndrome. I have asked doctors to check her thyroid, diabetes etc and all these results have come back fine. She is already developing breasts and her confidence is not good. She does not seem to remember things too well, which worries me as well. She did have a fall when she was about 5, out of a friends car window and hit her head, but by the grace of God, luckily did not sustain any serious injuries at that time.

I was raised in and around violence to which i suffered mentally as well as physically up until 3 years ago. I have suffered multiple of injuries due to the physical abuse from torn ligaments to dislocated joints. Its now getting to the point where i am constantly having pains and struggle to do even the basics of every day life. As you can imagine that over time i have seen multiple of Specialists and Doctors and feel like i am getting no place. I have had all possible tests/scans and all come back normal other than problems with vertebra s in the Lumbar part of my spine and Osgood Schlatters Disease in both knees. The other symptoms i suffer are Fatigue , Lack of Appetite , Nauseous, Sleep Deprivation , Weakness, Tenderness, Low Moods and this is only to name a few which are daily. I am struggling to make a living and live my life due to this and it is getting to the point where I NEED HELP. Not one professional doctor or specialist seems to be able to point exactly what is wrong with me and i feel like i m now going to explode. I just want to work, enjoy life and be able to be myself but i don t seem to be getting a break at all. I have had to throw away many careers because i cannot physically do anything anymore. I also want to mention that i manage to pick up every flu and cold virus ever possible and always suffer the symptoms of such severely. I have multiple of infections in my sinuses and chest and just over 12 months ago i have had to have my appendix removed because they swelled greatly which led to a mass of infections also.

Thanks for choosing H.C.M.Forum. From Your description it appears to be due to fibromyalgia. An auto immune disease charactarised by the same type of pains. They tend to have allergy as well with cold and cough. In a persons like you will have a psychological effect as well, they need to have a psychological treatment as well. It has nothing to do with psychological disorders, it is just an anxiety. I advise you to consult a physician for diagnosis and treatment ,who will take care of the  pains as well as psychological factors. Wishing for a quick and complete recovery.

To make you feel more confident I will explain you how a viral illness behaves so that you can be rest assured.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days.

Then in Feb. I had to have openheart surgery, a triple bypass. That prevented me from laying on my stomach so the mass was forgotten until last night.  I turned over and there it was, bigger and harder than before. Could it be a hernia?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for posting your query, From your description, if the bulge is retractable or reducible then the chances of it being an umbilical hernia is high. As you described that it usually occurs when you lay on your stomach, meaning that your abdominal are highly tensed/contracted and if there is bridge on your abdominal wall, that will force intestines to bulge through the orifice hence you feeling it on your navel. It will be best if you could pay a visit to a doctor who can take a closer look at it to determine exactly what it is. Other possibilities are intraabdominal benign tumors. Abdominal scan could help determine the nature of the bulge.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do.

An action is a good kid even if she or he is not eating well.2. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone.3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantities, and run away to play. As parents, we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity, but more aliquots per day.4. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her, and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding a good amount of ghee to it.5. I suggest you not use appetite stimulants in the long run as they may cause drowsiness.Hope I have answered your query.

Your son's fever shows that he has got some kind of infection irrespective of the origin of the pain abdomen. In paediatric age group, even simple upper respiratory tract infection can give rise to severe abdominal pain mimicking acute surgical abdomen at times. Nose bleeds could be related to the respiratory tract infection if he has it. Otherwise, one has to go for tests relating to bleeding disorders, and also have to rule out dengue fever. Last but not the least, any surgical abdomen has to be excluded which can be done by clinical and special radiological means. Also urinary tract infection has to be ruled out by simple urine test.

In lower age groups  bone remodelling can be better achieved so the treatment in later age group is difficult but treatable if shown to good pediatric orthopedics surgeon. giving shoe correction for balancing the weight equal to both hips is a conservative method. correction after age of 18 told to you is said because by this age bones grow to the adult size and remodelling can still be expected at this age but is usually slow.

Thanks for calling H.C.M.Forum. Your problem is diagnised as an incisional hernia, and is due to the surgery done some time back. Any hernia is not recovered by it self. It definitely requires surgery, more over it is growing so it must be operated and repaired. As it is growing there is a possibility of strangulation of the contents. So i advised you to consult the operated surgeon or some other surgeon for surgery and repair. Wishing for a quick and complete repair.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do. Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridges & soups.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

I will explain you how a viral illness behaves to that you can be more confident.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days.

For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do.For fever - Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.For cold you can use Cetrizine at 0.25mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days.For nasal block, plain saline nasal drops will do, every 4-6th hourly to relive nasal congestion.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My son's school have said he needs to have a deodorant in his p.e. kit to use after the p.e. lesson.

You have pain on the left side of stomach, started at belly button, and after 2 weeks it is spreading towards back.
