Identify the possible distances between vertices of a unit cube:   - The edge length of the unit cube is (1).   - The face diagonal (distance between two vertices on the same face but not on the same edge) is ( sqrt{2} ).   - The space diagonal (distance between two opposite vertices of the cube) is ( sqrt{3} ).2. Consider the minimum distance ( min{AB, AC, BC} ):   - For the minimum distance to be maximized, we need to ensure that the smallest distance among ( AB, AC, ) and ( BC ) is as large as possible.3. Analyze the possible configurations:   - If ( A, B, ) and ( C ) are all vertices of the cube, the minimum distance between any two points can be (1), ( sqrt{2} ), or ( sqrt{3} ).   - If ( A, B, ) and ( C ) are on the same face, the minimum distance can be (1) or ( sqrt{2} ).   - If ( A, B, ) and ( C ) are on different faces but not all vertices, the minimum distance can be (1) or ( sqrt{2} ).4. Maximize the minimum distance:   - To maximize ( min{AB, AC, BC} ), we need to ensure that the smallest distance among ( AB, AC, ) and ( BC ) is as large as possible.   - The largest possible minimum distance is ( sqrt{2} ), which occurs when ( A, B, ) and ( C ) are vertices of the cube such that no two points are on the same edge.5. Verify the configuration:   - Consider the vertices ( (0,0,0) ), ( (1,1,0) ), and ( (0,1,1) ).   - The distances are:     [     AB = sqrt{(1-0)^2 + (1-0)^2 + (0-0)^2} = sqrt{2}     ]     [     AC = sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (1-0)^2 + (1-0)^2} = sqrt{2}     ]     [     BC = sqrt{(1-0)^2 + (1-1)^2 + (0-1)^2} = sqrt{2}     ]   - Thus, ( min{AB, AC, BC} = sqrt{2} ).Conclusion:The positions of the points ( A, B, ) and ( C ) on the boundary of the unit cube that maximize ( min{AB, AC, BC} ) are such that each pair of points is separated by a distance of ( sqrt{2} ).

We can assume that avarrho=3, so x-3, y-3 are positive and avarrho < x, y. This leads us to a Diophantine equation. From this, we obtain as many solutions as there are ways to factorize 2 varrho^{2} into the product of two positive integers, since varrho, x-varrho, y-varrho together with x, y, a=x+varrho, b=y+varrho and c=x+y are also integers.It is interesting that for every value of varrho, there is a solution where the sides are in the ratio 3: 4: 5. This is due to the factorization of 2 varrho^{2} as varrho cdot 2 varrho: from x-varrho=varrho, y-varrho=2 varrho we get x=2 varrho, y=3 varrho and a=3 varrho, b=4 varrho, c=5 varrho.III. solution: It is known that the triples of integers a, b, c that satisfy equation (1) are called Pythagorean triples. Every multiple of a, b, c by a positive integer lambda is also a Pythagorean triple. If a and b are coprime, then c and a, and c and b are also coprime, in which case a, b, c is called a primitive triple. It is also known that every primitive triple can be expressed with two parameters u, v as follows:a=u cdot v, quad b=frac{u^{2}-v^{2}}{2}, quad c=frac{u^{2}+v^{2}}{2}where u and v are positive integers, odd and coprime. With these, every Pythagorean triple can be written as:a=lambda cdot u cdot v, quad b=lambda cdot frac{u^{2}-v^{2}}{2}, quad c=lambda cdot frac{u^{2}+v^{2}}{2}since every Pythagorean triple is a multiple of some primitive triple.Our task now is to select from (7) the triples that satisfy (2).

The cubes with no painted faces are located in the interior and their number is (a-2)(a-2)(c-2). The following must hold:8(a-2)+4(c-2)=16+(a-2)^{2}(c-2)We can simplify the expression to 0=32+a^{2} c-4 a c-2 a^{2}. From this, we can express a c(a-4)= 2left(a^{2}-16right)=2(a-4)(a+4).

Using this, the expression can be written as:sqrt{5}(cos alpha sin beta+sin alpha cos beta)=sqrt{5} sin (alpha+beta)The sine function attains its maximum value of 1 for acute angles when alpha+beta=90^{circ}, i.e., beta=90^{circ}-alpha. Thensqrt{x-2}=sin beta=sin left(90^{circ}-alpharight)=cos alpha=frac{1}{sqrt{5}}From this, we can calculate the value of x: sqrt{x-2}=frac{1}{sqrt{5}}, so x-2=frac{1}{5}, and thus x=2+frac{1}{5}.The maximum value of the expression is:sqrt{2+frac{1}{5}-2}+2 sqrt{3-2-frac{1}{5}}=sqrt{frac{1}{5}}+2 sqrt{frac{4}{5}}=frac{1}{sqrt{5}}+frac{4}{sqrt{5}}=frac{5}{sqrt{5}}=sqrt{5}IV. solution. Introduce the following vectors:mathbf{a}=(1, 2), quad mathbf{b}=(sqrt{x-2}, sqrt{3-x})Let gamma be the angle between the two vectors. Write the dot product of the two vectors in two ways:mathbf{a} cdot mathbf{b}=|mathbf{a}| cdot|mathbf{b}| cdot cos gamma=1 cdot sqrt{x-2}+2 cdot sqrt{3-x}Since cos gamma leq 1, we have |mathbf{a}| cdot|mathbf{b}| geq 1 cdot sqrt{x-2}+2 cdot sqrt{3-x}. Since |mathbf{a}|=sqrt{1+4}=sqrt{5} and |mathbf{b}|=sqrt{x-2+3-x}=1, we getsqrt{5} cdot 1 geq sqrt{x-2}+2 cdot sqrt{3-x}Thus, the maximum value of the expression is sqrt{5}.We need to calculate for which x this value is attained.sqrt{x-2}+2 cdot sqrt{3-x}=sqrt{5}Squaring both sides and simplifying:3 x-5=4 cdot sqrt{x-2} cdot sqrt{3-x}Squaring again and simplifying:0=25 x^{2}-110 x+121=(5 x-11)^{2}Thus, the expression attains its maximum value at x=frac{11}{5}.V. solution. The domain of the expression sqrt{x-2}+2 sqrt{3-x} is 2 leq x leq 3. By plotting in Excel, it can be inferred that the function attains its maximum at x=2.2. (We calculated the expression for a thousand values from 2 to 3 with a step size of 0.001, and from the plotted graph, it can be inferred that the maximum is around x=2.2, which we also verified by checking the values in the table.)We need to show that sqrt{x-2}+2 sqrt{3-x} leq sqrt{0.2}+2 sqrt{0.8}. Both sides are non-negative, so we can square them:begin{gathered}x-2+12-4 x+4 sqrt{x-2} cdot sqrt{3-x} leq 0.2+3.2+4 sqrt{0.2} cdot sqrt{0.8} 4 sqrt{x-2} cdot sqrt{3-x} leq-5+3 xend{gathered}The left side is positive and for x geq 2 the right side is also positive, so we can square again:begin{gathered}16 cdotleft(3 x+2 x-x^{2}-6right) leq 9 x^{2}-30 x+25 0 leq 25 x^{2}-110 x+121=(5 x-11)^{2}end{gathered}This is always true, and the steps can be reversed (due to the remarks made along the way).Thus, we have shown that the expression indeed attains its maximum at x=2.2, and the value of the maximum is sqrt{0.2}+2 sqrt{0.8} approx 2.236."},{"problem":"The diagonals AC and BD of a rhombus intersect at point O.

Therefore,begin{aligned}-sum_{i=1}^{17}(4i-1) &= -frac{17}{2}(2cdot3 + (17-1)cdot4) &= -frac{17}{2}(6 + 64) &= -frac{17}{2}cdot70 &= -17cdot35.end{aligned}Adding this result to 35^2:begin{aligned}S_{35} &= -17cdot35 + 35^2 &= -35cdot17 + 35cdot35 &= 35cdot(35 - 17) &= 35cdot18 &= 630.end{aligned}Thus, the sum of the first 35 terms of the sequence is boxed{630}."},{"problem":"471.

This can be done in binom{5}{3}=10 ways.- These 4 digits can be arranged in any order to form a four-digit number, which is 4! permutations.Thus, the total number of four-digit numbers for this case is 4 times binom{5}{3} times 4! = 4 times 10 times 24 = 960.Case 2: The even digit is 0.- There is 1 choice for the even digit (0).- As before, we choose 3 out of the 5 odd digits, which gives us binom{5}{3}=10 possibilities.- The digit 0 cannot be placed in the first position, so it has only 3 positions left to occupy.- The remaining 3 odd digits are then arranged in the other 3 positions, which is 3! permutations.Therefore, the total number of four-digit numbers for this case is binom{5}{3} times 3 times 3! = 10 times 3 times 6 = 180.Finally, by adding the numbers from both cases, we get the total number of possible four-digit numbers: 960 + 180 = boxed{1140}.So the correct choice is (D) 1140."},{"problem":"595*.

Since Mom completes a full lap around the lake in 12 minutes and meets Vanya every 12 minutes, in 12 minutes Vanya rides around the lake exactly 2 times, while Mom completes one lap. Therefore, Vanya's speed is twice that of Mom's. From this, it follows that when Vanya was riding in the same direction as Mom, their closing speed was equal to Mom's speed. If Vanya rides in the opposite direction, their closing speed will be three times Mom's speed, i.e., three times faster. Therefore, he will meet Mom three times more frequently, i.e., every 4 minutes.This reasoning can be conducted by introducing a notation for the length of the path.Let ( l ) be the length of the path around the lake (in meters), then Mom's speed is ( frac{l}{12} ) (m/min), and Vanya's speed is ( -frac{l}{6} ) (m/min). The closing speed when Mom and Vanya are riding towards each other is ( frac{3l}{12} = frac{l}{4} ) (m/min).

This fact utilizes the standard formula for the distance from a point to a line in the context of conic sections.- Given the asymptote equation is y=2x, we understand that the slope of the asymptote (frac{a}{b} for a hyperbola of the form frac{y^2}{a^2} - frac{x^2}{b^2} = 1) is 2. Hence, frac{a}{b} = 2.- Solving frac{a}{b}=2 with b=1, we deduce a = 2 cdot b = 2 cdot 1 = 2.- Therefore, the equation of the hyperbola C is frac{y^2}{4} - frac{x^2}{1} = 1 or frac{y^2}{4} - x^2 = 1.Part (2) Finding the Equation of Line l- Let's denote the coordinates of points A and B as A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2).

We then examine the intervals defined by these points:1. For x  4. Solving -5x > 4 gives x  4. Solving -x+2 > 4 gives no solution since the inequality simplifies to x  frac{1}{2}, both 3x+1 and 2x-1 are positive, so f(x) = 3x+1+2x-1 = 5x > 4. Solving 5x > 4 gives x > frac{4}{5}.Therefore, the solution set for f(x) > 4 is x  frac{4}{5}, which can be written as (-infty, -frac{4}{5}) cup (frac{4}{5}, +infty).

Indeed, due to the right angle, O, E_{a}, C, E_{b} are the vertices of a square, so the radius is equal to the distance C E_{b}=C E_{a} from the right angle vertex to the points of tangency on the legs. This distance, however, is equal to half the perimeter in any triangle, because the lengths of the tangents from an external point to a circle are equal, sobegin{gathered}C E_{b}+C E_{a}=C A+A E_{b}+C B+B E_{a}=C A+C B+left(A E_{c}+B E_{c}right)= =b+a+c=2 send{gathered}thus C E_{b}=s.Accordingly, in our case, expressed in terms of m, n,varrho_{c}=m^{2}+m n=m(m+n)=420Here, m+n is certainly odd, as the sum of an even and an odd number, so m is even, and in fact divisible by 4.

Find the minimum value of a+b.","solution":"To solve this problem, we analyze the given equations of the circles and their geometric properties.Step 1: Analyze Circle C_{1}Given the equation of circle C_{1}: x^{2}+y^{2}+2ax+a^{2}-4=0, we can identify its center and radius by comparing it to the standard form of a circle's equation (x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}. For C_{1}, the center is at (-a, 0) and the radius r_{1} is obtained by simplifying the equation to find r_{1}^{2} = a^{2}-4+a^{2}. Since r_{1}^{2} = 4, it follows that r_{1} = 2.Step 2: Analyze Circle C_{2}Similarly, for circle C_{2}: x^{2}+y^{2}-2by-1+b^{2}=0, its center is at (0, b), and the radius r_{2} is found by simplifying r_{2}^{2} = 1-1+b^{2}. Thus, r_{2} = 1.Step 3: Condition for Internal TangencyGiven that the circles have only one common tangent line, they must be internally tangent to each other. The distance between their centers, |C_{1}C_{2}|, is equal to the absolute difference of their radii, r_{1} - r_{2}. Therefore, we have:[|C_{1}C_{2}| = sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}} = r_{1} - r_{2} = 2 - 1 = 1]Step 4: Solve for a and bFrom the equation a^{2}+b^{2}=1, we can introduce trigonometric substitutions to simplify the expression.

This substitution is valid because cos^{2}alpha + sin^{2}alpha = 1 for any real alpha.Step 5: Find the Minimum Value of a+bThe sum a+b can be expressed as cosalpha + sinalpha, which can be rewritten using the trigonometric identity as sqrt{2}sinleft(alpha+frac{pi}{4}right). The range of sintheta is [-1, 1], so the range of sqrt{2}sinleft(alpha+frac{pi}{4}right) is [-sqrt{2}, sqrt{2}]. The minimum value of a+b is thus -sqrt{2}, which occurs when alpha+frac{pi}{4} = -frac{pi}{2}+2kpi, implying alpha = -frac{3}{4}pi+2kpi, where kin mathbb{Z}.Therefore, the minimum value of a+b is boxed{-sqrt{2}}."},{"problem":"Given a frustum of a cone with the areas of its two bases being 4pi and 25pi respectively, and the height of the frustum is 4, find the volume and the lateral surface area of the frustum.","solution":"To solve this, the volume V of the frustum can be calculated using the formula V = frac{1}{3}(4pi + 25pi + sqrt{4pi cdot 25pi}) cdot 4 = 42pi.

Call a positive integer a hussel number if:(1) All digits are not equal to 0.(2) The number is divisible by 11.(3) The number is divisible by 12. If you rearrange the digits in any other random order, you always get a number that is divisible by 12.How many 10-digit hussel numbers are there?","solution":"## 1. Version for Grade 5 & Grade 6To begin with, we note that a hussel number can only contain the digits 2, 4, 6, and 8. Indeed, if we arrange the digits in any random order, we get an even number (divisible by 12) due to property (3). Since the last digit of an even number is always even, it must be 2, 4, 6, or 8 because 0 is not included due to property (1). Since we can place any digit at the end, this applies to every digit of a hussel number.Next, we note that a hussel number can only contain the digits 4 and 8. Suppose a hussel number has the digit 2. By suitably rearranging the digits, we get a number where the last digit is 2. The last two digits of this number are then 22, 42, 62, or 82. The number is then not divisible by 4 (and thus not divisible by 12), contradicting property (3). Similarly, a hussel number cannot have the digit 6 because a number ending in 26, 46, 66, or 86 is not divisible by 4.Since a hussel number is divisible by 3 (because it is divisible by 12), the sum of its digits is also divisible by 3. If we have ( k ) eights and ( 10 - k ) fours, then the sum of the digits is ( 8k + 4(10 - k) = 40 + 4k = 36 + 4(k + 1) ). This is divisible by 3 if ( k + 1 ) is divisible by 3, i.e., if ( k = 2 ), ( k = 5 ), or ( k = 8 ). We see that a hussel number of ten digits must consist of 2 eights and 8 fours, 5 eights and 5 fours, or 8 eights and 2 fours. Note that these numbers all satisfy properties (1) and (3). We only need to check which of these numbers are divisible by 11 (property (2)).We use the 11-criterion: a number is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11. By alternating sum, we mean that we take the digits alternately with a plus sign and a minus sign. In our case, all digits are either 4 or 8, so the alternating sum must be divisible by ( 4 times 11 = 44 ). Since the alternating sum can never be greater than ( 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 - 4 - 4 - 4 - 4 - 4 = 20 ) (and never less than -20), the alternating sum must be 0. In other words, the sum of the five digits in the odd positions must be equal to the sum of the five digits in the even positions. This means that the number of eights in the odd positions must be equal to the number of eights in the even positions. We consider the three cases we previously distinguished:- Suppose there are 2 eights in total. The only requirement now is that there is exactly 1 eight in an odd position and 1 eight in an even position. There are thus ( 5 times 5 = 25 ) possibilities.- Suppose there are 5 eights in total. Since we cannot divide the eights into two equal quantities, there are no solutions in this case.- Suppose there are 8 eights in total. The only requirement now is that there are exactly 4 eights in the odd positions and 4 eights in the even positions. In other words, 1 odd position is a four and 1 even position is a four. There are again ( 5 times 5 = 25 ) possibilities.We conclude that there are a total of ( 25 + 25 = 50 ) ten-digit hussel numbers."},{"problem":"It is known that P is the point on the number line representing -4.

Eight points satisfying the condition of the problem exist. It is sufficient to take these points as follows: two points of type (0 ; 0), two of type (0 ; 1), two of type (1 ; 0), and two of type (1 ; 1). Moreover, no three of them should lie on the same line. These conditions are satisfied, for example, by the following points: (0 ; 0),(0 ; 3),(3 ; 1),(3 ; 4),(1 ; 0),(4 ; 3),(1 ; 1),(7 ; 4). Suppose now that there exist 9 points satisfying the condition of the problem. We will divide these 9 points into groups of the same type. Then no group contains 3 points (otherwise they would form a triangle in which the medians intersect at an integer point). Therefore, there are at least five groups in total, and among our 9 points, there will be 5 points of different types. We will divide these 5 points into 3 groups depending on the remainder of the division by 3 of the first coordinate. No group contains 3 points (indeed, if such 3 points existed, they would have types (r ; 0),(r ; 1),(r ; 2) for some r, and thus would form a triangle with an integer point of intersection of the medians). Therefore, in two of these groups, there are two points each, and in the third group, there is one point. Without loss of generality, we can assume that this one point has type (0 ; 0). Then among our 5 points, there are no points of type (0 ; 1) and (0 ; 2). Moreover, among them, there cannot be two points of type (1 ; 1) and (2 ; 2) simultaneously (otherwise they, together with a point of type (0 ; 0), would form a triangle in which the medians intersect at an integer point). For the same reason, among them, there cannot be two points of type (1 ; 2) and (2 ; 1), and two points of type (1 ; 0) and (2 ; 0).

The lengths of the diagonals are then calculated as follows:  |vec{AC}| = sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-4)^2} = sqrt{16 + 16} = sqrt{32} = 4sqrt{2},  |vec{BD}| = sqrt{2^2 + 6^2} = sqrt{4 + 36} = sqrt{40} = 2sqrt{10}.Thus, the length of AC is boxed{4sqrt{2}} and the length of BD is boxed{2sqrt{10}}.(2) We have vec{AB}=(-3,-5) and vec{OC}=(-2,-1). Plugging this into the given equation:(vec{AB}+tvec{OC})cdotvec{OC}=0,   we get:(-3,-5)cdot(-2,-1) + t(-2,-1)cdot(-2,-1) = 0.Calculating the dot products gives us:  (-3)cdot(-2) + (-5)cdot(-1) + t((-2)^2 + (-1)^2) = 6 + 5 + 5t = 0.Solving for t, we get:  11 + 5t = 0,  5t = -11,  t = -frac{11}{5}.Therefore, the value of t is boxed{-frac{11}{5}}."},{"problem":"A rectangular piece of paper ABCD has sides of lengths AB = 1, BC = 2.

Initial Setup and First Fold:   - We start with a rectangle (ABCD) where (AB = 1) and (BC = 2).   - The rectangle is folded in half such that (AD) coincides with (BC). This means the folding line (EF) is parallel to (AB) and (CD) and is located at the midpoint of (AD) and (BC). Therefore, (EF) is at (y = 0.5).2. Second Fold:   - We fold the paper along a line (BM) such that the corner (A) falls on the line (EF). Let (M) be the point on (BC) such that (BM) is the folding line.   - Since (A) falls on (EF), the coordinates of (A) after folding will be on the line (y = 0.5).3. Finding Point (M):   - Let (M) be the point ((x, 0)) on (BC). Since (BM) is the folding line, the reflection of (A) across (BM) will lie on (EF).   - The coordinates of (A) are ((0, 1)). After folding, the coordinates of (A) will be ((x, 0.5)).4. Using Geometry to Find (M):   - The line (BM) will be the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining (A) and its image on (EF). Therefore, the midpoint of (A) and its image is ((frac{x}{2}, frac{1 + 0.5}{2}) = (frac{x}{2}, 0.75)).   - Since (BM) is the perpendicular bisector, it must pass through this midpoint.5. Calculating the Slope of (BM):   - The slope of (BM) is (frac{0.75 - 0}{frac{x}{2} - 0} = frac{1.5}{x}).6. Finding the Angle (angle ABM):   - The slope of (AB) is (frac{1 - 0}{0 - 0} = infty), which means (AB) is a vertical line.   - The angle (angle ABM) is the angle between the vertical line (AB) and the line (BM).   - Using the tangent function, (tan(angle ABM) = frac{1.5}{x}).7. Solving for (x):   - Since (M) lies on (BC), (x) must be such that the reflection of (A) lies on (EF). This implies (x = sqrt{2}).8. Calculating the Angle:   - (tan(angle ABM) = frac{1.5}{sqrt{2}}).   - (angle ABM = tan^{-1}(frac{1.5}{sqrt{2}}) = 30^circ).The final answer is (boxed{30^circ})."},{"problem":"5.

We take the k-tuple (1,1, ldots, 1). We multiply one (arbitrary) element of this k-tuple by the number p_{1}, which means that for p_{1} we have k possibilities. Further, in the resulting k-tuple, we multiply one (arbitrary) element by p_{2}, which means that for p_{2} we have k possibilities.

For each (i = 1, 2, ldots, n), there exists one number (t_i) among ({a_i, b_i}) such that ( |a_i - b_i| = t_i - k_i ), where (k_i) is the other number in ({a_i, b_i}).3. We need to show that:   [   sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - b_i| = n^2   ]4. Note that the sum of all numbers from (1) to (2n) is:   [   sum_{i=1}^{2n} i = frac{2n(2n+1)}{2} = n(2n+1)   ]5.

Then there exists (l in {1, 2, ldots, n}) such that (k_l = h), so (t_l > h).8. Since (h) is the maximum number among ({k_1, k_2, ldots, k_n}), we consider two cases:   - Case 1: (k_l = a_l). Then (p = l) and (b_l > h), so all of (b_1, b_2, ldots, b_l, a_{l+1}, a_{l+2}, ldots, a_n) are distinct and greater than (h), which is impossible since (h > n).   - Case 2: (k_l = b_l).

For this n, the last digit of f(n) is 1, meaning f(n) is not divisible by either 2 or 5. Therefore, the number k is coprime with 10. According to the Euler-Fermat theorem, 9k is a divisor of 10^{t}-1, where t=varphi(9k). Therefore, k is also a divisor of the t-digit number K=frac{10^{t}-1}{9}, which consists entirely of 1s.

In the solution, the Euler-Fermat theorem was only needed to show that k has a multiple consisting entirely of 1s. This, however, can also be obtained by applying the pigeonhole principle.

Since 143=11 cdot 13, a+b>1 and a+c>1, it must be {a+b, a+c}={11,13}, so |b-c|=|(a+b)-(a+c)|=|11-13|=2, and the triple (a, b, c)=(1,10,12) satisfies the conditions.]D1. In each cell of a 2 times 2 table, a natural number is written. If we add the product of the numbers in the first column, the product of the numbers in the second column, the product of the numbers in the first row, and the product of the numbers in the second row, we get the result 2021. a) Determine all possible values of the sum of all four numbers in the table. b) Find the number of tables satisfying the conditions that contain four distinct numbers. [a) The only value is 90, b) 3528. a) The numbers in the table can be denoted as a, b, c, d such that a b+c d+a c+b d=(a+d)(b+c)=2021=43 cdot 47. Therefore, {a+d, b+c}={43,47}, so a+b+c+d=43+47=90. b) According to the solution in a), we distinguish two cases: a+d=43 and b+c=47, or a+d=47 and b+c=43. In the first case, the pair (a, d) can be chosen in 42 ways and the pair (b, c) in 46 ways, and in the second case, these numbers are reversed. Thus, there are 2 cdot 42 cdot 46 different satisfying tables, including those with some numbers equal. We need to determine the number of such tables to subtract it from the total number. Since 43 and 47 are odd numbers, in each satisfying table, a neq d and b neq c. In each table with some numbers equal, at least one of the equalities a=b, a=c, d=b, d=c must hold, and due to a+d neq b+c, exactly one of them (verify by considering all possible selections of two equalities). Each of these four equalities is satisfied by 42 satisfying tables in each of the two distinguished cases, so their total number is 2 cdot 4 cdot 42=8 cdot 42.

Assigning Variables:   - Let x be the number of workers assigned to produce bolts.3. Formulating the Equation:   - The workers assigned to produce bolts will produce 16x bolts per day.   - Since each bolt requires two nuts, the total number of nuts needed for these bolts is 2 times 16x.   - The remaining workers, which are 56 - x, will be producing nuts. Each of these workers produces 24 nuts per day, so together they produce 24(56 - x) nuts per day.4.

Therefore, we set the equation as:   [   2 times 16x = 24(56 - x)   ]5.

How many seats could fantasticbobob have started in?[i]2019 CCA Math Bonanza Team Round #8[/i]","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   - We have a 29 times 29 grid of seats, totaling 841 seats.   - There are 840 contestants, each sitting in one seat.   - After a break, each contestant moves to a seat that is horizontally or vertically adjacent to their original seat.   - We need to determine how many possible seats fantasticbobob could have originally sat in, given that his seat was taken when he returned.2. Analyzing the Movement:   - Each contestant moves to an adjacent seat, which means each seat is either occupied by its original occupant or by one of its adjacent seats' occupants.   - This movement implies that each seat in the grid is part of a pair of adjacent seats that swap places or remain in place.3. Counting Valid Seats:   - We need to count the number of seats that could be fantasticbobob's original seat, which means it must be a seat that could be taken by another contestant moving from an adjacent seat.   - We will use a recursive approach to count the number of valid seats in smaller grids and then extend this to the 29 times 29 grid.4. Recursive Pattern:   - Let's denote s(n) as the number of valid seats in an n times n grid.   - We start with small cases and build up:     - For a 1 times 1 grid, s(1) = 1 (the only seat is valid).     - For a 3 times 3 grid, s(3) = 5 (the center and the four corners are valid).     - For a 5 times 5 grid, s(5) = 13 (the center, the four corners, and the eight edge centers are valid).5. Generalizing the Pattern:   - We observe that the number of valid seats increases in a specific pattern as the grid size increases.   - The increase in the number of valid seats from s(n) to s(n+2) follows a pattern where s(n+2) - s(n) = 4 times (n+1).   - This pattern can be derived from the observation that each new layer of the grid adds four more valid seats for each side of the grid.6. Calculating for 29 times 29 Grid:   - Starting from s(1) = 1, we use the recursive pattern to calculate up to s(29):     [     begin{align*}     s(3) &= s(1) + 4 times 2 = 1 + 8 = 9,      s(5) &= s(3) + 4 times 4 = 9 + 16 = 25,      s(7) &= s(5) + 4 times 6 = 25 + 24 = 49,      &vdots      s(29) &= s(27) + 4 times 28 = 377 + 112 = 489.     end{align*}     ]7.

What is the shortest distance the ray could have traveled?","solution":"Answer: frac{10 sqrt{3}}{9}.Solution. Let N be the point from which the ray is emitted, and K be the point on the base of the pyramid where the ray will finally hit.We will sequentially \\"straighten\\" the path of the ray as follows: if at some moment the ray should reflect off a certain plane, we will assume that it continues its path, but in a \\"mirrored\\" copy of the pyramid. Note also that due to the perpendicularity of the edges D A, D B, and D C, the planes (A B D), (B C D), and (C A D) remain in place when reflected relative to each other. Therefore, the result of our \\"straightening\\" will be the segment N K_{1}, where K_{1} is the point obtained from K after sequential reflections relative to the planes (A B D), (B C D), and (C A D) in some order. The length of the segment N K_{1} is exactly equal to the total distance traveled by the ray.We introduce coordinates: D is the origin, and D A, D B, and D C are the directions of the axes. Then, the symmetry relative to each of the specified planes changes the sign of exactly one of the coordinates of the point. Consequently, the point K_{1} is obtained from the point K by changing the signs of all coordinates, i.e., by symmetry relative to the point D. Therefore, the point K_{1} lies on the image of the plane A B C under symmetry relative to the point D.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_a567280d18f9fc82386fg-14.jpg?height=720&width=694&top_left_y=488&top_left_x=698)The length of any such segment does not exceed the distance between these planes. It is easy to see that this distance is equal to twice the distance from the point D to the plane A B C. We can reason in different ways, but we will present only one of them.The distance from the point D to the plane A B C is equal to the height h of the pyramid A B C D dropped from the point D. The volume of the pyramid A B C D is then, on the one hand, V_{A B C D} = frac{1}{3} S_{A B C} h, and on the other hand, V_{A B C D} = frac{1}{6} cdot D A cdot D B cdot D C = frac{25}{6}. It remains to find S_{A B C}. This can also be done in several ways.For example: by the Pythagorean theorem, C A = C B = sqrt{5^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{26}, A B = sqrt{5^2 + 5^2} = sqrt{50}, in the isosceles triangle A C B, it is easy to compute cos angle C A B = frac{A B / 2}{A C} = sqrt{frac{25}{52}}, from which sin angle C A B = sqrt{frac{27}{52}}, andS_{A B C} = frac{1}{2} cdot A C cdot A B cdot sin angle C A B = frac{15 sqrt{3}}{2}Therefore, h = frac{3 V_{A B C D}}{S_{A B C}} = frac{25}{15 sqrt{3}} = frac{5 sqrt{3}}{9}, from which it follows that the length of the path of any ray is not less than frac{10 sqrt{3}}{9}.It remains to provide an example where the length we found is achieved. For this, it is sufficient to present a point on the plane A B C whose perpendicular from D falls inside the triangle symmetric to A B C relative to the point D.Indeed, then the coordinates of the point K_{1} will be negative, so the perpendicular will intersect all coordinate planes. As the point N, almost any point in the neighborhood of the base of the perpendicular from the point D to the plane (A B C) will do. Almost any, since we need the perpendicular N K_{1} not to pass through the coordinate axes.Comment.

Please complete the following 2times 2 contingency table based on the given information, and determine whether there is a 95% confidence that the winner is related to the format.[begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}hline& text{Old Format} & text{New Format} & text{Total} hlinetext{A Wins} & 6 & 9 & 15 hlinetext{B Wins} & 4 & 1 & 5 hlinetext{Total} & 10 & 10 & 20 hlineend{array}](2) Student C is good at buzzer questions.

Let left(x^{p}+a x^{q}+1right)left(x^{r}+b x^{s}+1right)=x^{12}+1(*).Since the degrees of the monomials on both sides are equal, then p+r=12. The numbers a and b are not both zero (otherwise, after expanding the brackets and combining like terms, there would be at least three monomials in the left part).First, consider the case when one of the numbers a and b is zero (let's assume a=0). Then the left part of the equality (*) is x^{p}+1+b x^{s+p}+b x^{s}+x^{12}+x^{r}. Since each of the monomials x^{p} and x^{r} must cancel with one of the others, each of the numbers p and r must be equal to one of the numbers s and s+p. Since p<s+p, then p=s and r=p+s=2 s. Since p+r=3 s=12, we get s=4, p=8, r=12, b=-1, i.e., the first of the two answers.Now consider the case when the numbers a and b are non-zero.

In one set, there cannot be numbers, one of which is to the left and above the other (either strictly to the left or strictly above), because then the second number is strictly greater than the first. Therefore, a set cannot contain more than three numbers, and a set of three numbers can only consist of the numbers r, q+s, p. Therefore, the numbers in the table are divided into three groups: r=q+s=p, s=q, q+r=p+s. From this, we get q=s=3 and p=r=6.

Find the coordinates of B_0, C_0, and D_0:   Similarly, we can find the coordinates of B_0, C_0, and D_0:   [   B_0 = left( frac{3a}{2}, frac{-3b}{2} right), quad C_0 = left( frac{3a}{2}, frac{3b}{2} right), quad D_0 = left( frac{-3a}{2}, frac{3b}{2} right)   ]6.

If 99 is a multiple of mathrm{a}, then mathrm{a}=1, 3, 9, 11, 33, 99.Since 83=9 times 3+8 times 7=11+8 times 9, mathrm{a} cannot be 1, 3, 9, 11 (otherwise 83 can be obtained).Since 103=99+14=33+70=2 times 33+37, when a=99 or 33, a total score of 103 cannot be obtained.Therefore, this situation is also impossible.If 91 is a multiple of mathrm{a}, then mathrm{a}=1, 7, 13, 91, since 83=7 times 5+8 times 6, so mathrm{a} neq 7.1 quad 103=91+12, so mathrm{a} neq 91.Therefore, mathrm{a}=13, and it is not difficult to verify that mathrm{a}=13 meets the requirements."},{"problem":"10.

Their combination, g(x) = -sqrt{x} - 2x, therefore, results in a decreasing function in its domain, meeting the condition.From this analysis, the functions that satisfy the given condition are f(x)=(frac{1}{2})^x and f(x)=-sqrt{x}.Thus, the answer is boxed{2, 5}."},{"problem":"If the complex number z satisfies (1+2i) cdot z = 2+i, where i is the imaginary unit, then |z| =  A: dfrac{3}{5}B: dfrac{4}{5}C: 1D: 2","solution":"Analysis:  This problem examines the operation of complex numbers and the modulus of a complex number.

For an acute-angled triangle, the circumcenter (the point where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides meet) is located inside the triangle. This is because all the angles are less than 90^circ, and the perpendicular bisectors will intersect at a point that is equidistant from all three vertices, lying within the triangle.2. For a right-angled triangle, the circumcenter is located at the midpoint of the hypotenuse. This is because the hypotenuse acts as the diameter of the circumcircle, and by the property of a right-angled triangle, the midpoint of the hypotenuse is equidistant from all three vertices.3. For an obtuse-angled triangle, where one angle is greater than 90^circ, the circumcenter lies outside the triangle. This is because the perpendicular bisectors of the sides need to extend beyond the obtuse angle to intersect at a point that is equidistant from all three vertices.Given that the circumcenter of triangle triangle ABC lies on one of the sides of the triangle, the only scenario that fits this description is when triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle.

Find the mean of a 1 over all elements of S. Solution","solution":": Let the mean be f(n) and let s n = 1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/n. Then f(n) = n - (n-1)/s n-1 . Solution by Carl Johan Ragnarsson Let a(n) be the number of permutations in S and b(n) the sum of their first elements, so that f(n) = a(n)/b(n). We find that a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, b(2) = 1, a(3) = 3, b(3) = 5. If the first element of the permutation is 1, then whatever element comes second will be greater than all its predecessors. But n will also be greater than all its predecessors, wherever it comes. So n must come second. But then the order is immaterial, because nothing exceeds n. Thus there are exactly (n-2)! permutations with first element 1 in S. If the first element is not 1, then 1 can come anywhere and the other numbers form can all be decremented by 1 to give a permutation of n-1 which meets the conditions. Conversely, given a permutation of n-1 which meets the conditions we can increase each element by 1 and then put 1 in any of the n-1 positions except the first to get a permutation for n which meets the conditions. Thus a(n) = (n-1) a(n-1) + (n-2)! and b(n) = (n-1) (a(n-1) + b(n-1) ) + (n-2)! = a(n) + (n-1) b(n-1). It is now a trivial induction to show that a(n) = (n-1)! s n-1 . It is also easy to show by induction that b(n) = n! s n-1 - (n-1).(n-1)! . For n = 2 this reads b(2) = 2 - 1 = 1, which is true. Assuming it is true for n-1, we have b n = a(n) + (n-1) b(n-1) = (n-1)! s n-1 + (n-1) (n-1)! s n-2 - (n-1)(n-2).(n-2)! = (n-1)! s n-2 + (n-2)! + (n-1) (n-1)! s n-2 - (n-1)(n-2).(n-2)! = n! s n-2 + (n-2)! - (n-2).(n-1)! = n! s n-1 - (n-1).(n-1)! - n!/(n-1) + (n-2)! + (n-1)! = n! s n-1 - (n-1).(n-1)! + (n-2)! (-n + 1 + n - 1) = n! s n-1 - (n-1).(n-1)! which completes the induction.

We know that when we increase the denominator of a fraction, the fraction decreases; for example, 27/10 is less than 27/8. Therefore, the larger the denominator n, the smaller the fractions 130 / n and 195/n will be, which means the fewer shelves will be used.

Prove that we cannot cut more than 2500 trees:   - Consider the square grid of trees with coordinates ranging from ((0,0)) to ((99,99)).   - Divide this grid into (2500) smaller squares, each of size (2 times 2). Each smaller square contains four points: ((2i, 2j)), ((2i+1, 2j)), ((2i, 2j+1)), and ((2i+1, 2j+1)) for (0 leq i, j leq 49).   - Within each (2 times 2) square, any tree stump can see the other three tree stumps. Therefore, at most one tree in each (2 times 2) square can be cut down to ensure that no two stumps can see each other.   - Since there are (2500) such (2 times 2) squares, the maximum number of trees that can be cut down is (2500).2. Prove that we can cut down 2500 trees:   - We will show that it is possible to cut down all trees with even-numbered coordinates without violating the condition.   - Consider the trees at coordinates ((2i, 2j)) for (0 leq i, j leq 49). These are the bottom-left trees in each (2 times 2) square.   - We need to prove that no two stumps at these coordinates can see each other. Consider two such points (P = (2a, 2b)) and (Q = (2c, 2d)) where (a, b, c, d in {0, 1, ldots, 49}) and ((a, b) neq (c, d)).   - The line segment (PQ) must contain at least one lattice point with at least one odd coordinate to ensure that no two stumps can see each other.   - The midpoint of (PQ) is (left(frac{2a + 2c}{2}, frac{2b + 2d}{2}right) = (a + c, b + d)). Since (a neq c) or (b neq d), at least one of (a + c) or (b + d) is odd, ensuring that the midpoint is not a point with even coordinates.   - Therefore, the segment (PQ) contains a point with at least one odd coordinate, ensuring that no two stumps can see each other.Thus, it is possible to cut down exactly (2500) trees such that no two stumps can see each other.The final answer is (boxed{2500})"},{"problem":"Let n ge 3 be an integer, and consider a circle with n + 1 equally spaced points marked on it.

Prove that M = N + 1.","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to prove that the number of beautiful labelings ( M ) of ( n+1 ) equally spaced points on a circle is equal to ( N + 1 ), where ( N ) is the number of ordered pairs ((x, y)) of positive integers such that ( x + y leq n ) and ( gcd(x, y) = 1 ).2. Counting ( N ):   The number ( N ) is the count of pairs ((x, y)) such that ( x + y leq n ) and ( gcd(x, y) = 1 ). For any integer ( t ), the number of pairs ((x, y)) with ( x + y = t ) and ( gcd(x, y) = 1 ) is given by Euler's totient function ( phi(t) ). Therefore,   [   N = sum_{t=2}^{n} phi(t).   ]3. Constructing ( N + 1 ) Beautiful Labelings:   We need to construct ( N + 1 ) beautiful labelings. We will construct ( phi(t) ) labelings with ( t ) immediately to the left of ( 0 ) for each ( 1 leq t leq n ).4. Labeling Construction:   Consider an arbitrary ( 1 < t leq n ) and ( 1 leq i < t ) with ( gcd(i, t) = 1 ). For ( 0 leq j < t ), let ( S_j ) be the set of numbers ( {j, j+t, ldots, j + leftlfloor frac{n-j}{t} rightrfloor cdot t} ). For each ( 0 leq k < t ), let ( a_k ) be the remainder of ( ki ) upon division by ( t ). If we write the numbers in ( S_{a_0} ) counterclockwise in this order, then the numbers in ( S_{a_1} ) counterclockwise in this order, etc., we will obtain a beautiful labeling.5. Verification of Beautiful Labeling:   To verify, let ( 0 leq a < b < c < d leq n ) such that ( a + d = b + c ). If ( a equiv b pmod{t} ) and ( c equiv d pmod{t} ) or ( a equiv c pmod{t} ) and ( b equiv d pmod{t} ), the chords connecting ( a ) and ( d ), and ( b ) and ( c ) are disjoint. Otherwise, let ( b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4 ) be such that ( a in S_{b_1}, b in S_{b_2}, c in S_{b_3}, d in S_{b_4} ). Since ( b_1i + b_4i equiv a + d equiv b + c equiv b_2i + b_3i pmod{t} ), ( gcd(i, t) = 1 ) yields ( b_1 + b_4 = b_2 + b_3 ). This implies the chords connecting ( a ) and ( d ), and ( b ) and ( c ) are disjoint.6. Counting Distinct Labelings:   We have constructed a beautiful labeling for every pair ( 1 leq i < t leq n ) with ( gcd(i, t) = 1 ). There are precisely ( N ) of these, and they are all distinct. Additionally, the labeling ( 0, 1, 2, ldots, n ) in counterclockwise order is also beautiful and hasn't been considered yet, bringing the total to ( N + 1 ) beautiful labelings.7. Uniqueness of Beautiful Labelings:   We now show that these are the only beautiful labelings. Consider an arbitrary beautiful labeling, and suppose ( x ) is the positive integer to the left of ( 0 ). For ( 0 leq i < x ), define ( S_i ) similarly as before. By convention, let ( S_{i+x} = S_i ) for all ( i in mathbb{Z} ).8. Listing and Lemmas:   List the numbers of this beautiful labeling starting with ( 0 ), then ( x ), and continuing counterclockwise. We prove several lemmas to show the structure of the list and the order of elements.9. Final Induction:   By induction, we show that the first ( |S_0| + |S_y| + cdots + |S_{ky}| ) numbers in the list are precisely ( 0, x, ldots, (|S_0|-1)x, y, y+x, ldots, y+(|S_1|-1)x, ldots ) for each ( 1 leq k leq x-1 ). This implies that every beautiful labeling corresponds to some ordered pair ((x, y)) of positive integers with ( x geq 2 ) and ( gcd(x, y) = 1 ), or ( x = 1 ).10. Conclusion:    These constructions match the ( N + 1 ) beautiful labelings we found in Step 1, completing the proof.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ M = N + 1 } )"},{"problem":"Let star be an operation defined in the set of nonnegative integers with the following properties: for any nonnegative integers x and y,(i) (x + 1)star 0 = (0star x) + 1(ii) 0star (y + 1) = (ystar 0) + 1(iii) (x + 1)star (y + 1) = (xstar y) + 1.If 123star 456 = 789, find 246star 135.","solution":"1.

We know that the total number of students is B + G = 1600. Now, from the stratified sample of 200 students, the ratio between boys and girls should be approximately the same as the ratio in the entire school population. Since there are 10 fewer girls than boys in the sample, we can write G_s = B_s - 10, where G_s is the number of girls in the sample, and B_s is the number of boys in the sample.Since the sample size is 200 students, G_s + B_s = 200. Substituting G_s = B_s - 10 into the equation, we get B_s - 10 + B_s = 200, which simplifies to 2B_s = 210. Solving for B_s gives us B_s = 105. Therefore, G_s = B_s - 10 = 105 - 10 = 95. The sample ratio of boys to girls should be the same as the ratio for the entire school. So we have frac{B}{G} = frac{B_s}{G_s}. Substituting in the values we have, frac{B}{G} = frac{105}{95}. Expressing B in terms of G using the total number of students, we have B = 1600 - G. Plugging this into the ratio, we get frac{1600 - G}{G} = frac{105}{95}. Cross-multiplying gives us 95(1600 - G) = 105G, which simplifies to 152000 - 95G = 105G. Combining like terms, we get 152000 = 200G.

At this point, it is not immediately obvious what x_0 is.

Define \\"very prime\\" numbers: A natural number is called \\"very prime\\" if any number of consecutive digits (including a single digit or the number itself) is a prime number.2.

Let's denote the right side by f(x).Note that f(x) xrightarrow{x}-infty as x rightarrow-infty and f(x) rightarrow-infty as x rightarrow+infty. Also, f(x) has a vertical asymptote at x=0.The derivative of the function f(x) is f^{prime}(x)=frac{8}{x^{2}}-2 x-6=frac{8-2 x-6 x^{2}}{x^{2}}=-frac{2(x-1)(x+2)^{2}}{x^{2}}.Thus, the function f(x) on the interval (-infty,-2] increases from -infty to f(-2)=12; on the interval [-2,0) - continues to increase from 12 to +infty; on the interval (0,1]- increases from -infty to f(1)= -15 ; finally, on the interval [1,+infty) - decreases from -15 to -infty.Therefore, each value from the interval ( -infty ;-15 ) the function f(x) takes exactly three times; -15 - two times; from the interval ( -15 ;+infty ) - once. (For example, the value -15 the function will take once at the point 1, and the second time - on the interval (-infty,-2) ).Hence, the equation (*), and with it the original equation, has exactly three solutions for a in (-infty ;-15)."},{"problem":"|-4|=____.","solution":"To solve the problem |-4|=____, we follow the definition of the absolute value function.

Direct calculation of this problem would be very cumbersome and impractical.

Determine, with proof, b_{32}.","solution":"1. Generalization and Induction Setup:   We start by generalizing the problem. Define ( P_k(z) ) as:   [   P_k(z) := (1-z)^{b_1}(1-z^2)^{b_2}cdots(1-z^k)^{b_k}   ]   This polynomial has the property that if we multiply it out and discard all terms involving ( z ) to a power larger than ( k ), what is left is just ( 1-2z ). We aim to show that this property holds for all ( k ).2. Base Case:   For ( k = 1 ), we have:   [   P_1(z) = (1-z)^{b_1}   ]   To satisfy ( P_1(z) = 1-2z ), we need ( b_1 = 2 ). Thus, ( P_1(z) = (1-z)^2 = 1 - 2z + z^2 ), and discarding the ( z^2 ) term leaves ( 1-2z ).3. Inductive Step:   Assume the property holds for ( k ), i.e., ( P_k(z) = 1-2z + a_{k+1}z^{k+1} + cdots ). Then for ( k+1 ):   [   P_{k+1}(z) = P_k(z)(1-z^{k+1})^{b_{k+1}}   ]   To maintain the property, we need ( b_{k+1} = a_{k+1} ).4. Symmetry Property:   Each ( P_k ) has the property:   [   P_kleft(frac{1}{z}right) = (-z)^{deg P_k} P_k(z)   ]   This symmetry will be useful in our calculations.5. Sum of Powers of Roots:   Let ( Q_{n,k} ) denote the sum of the ( k )-th powers of the roots of ( P_n ). We claim that ( Q_{n,n} = 2^n ) for all ( n ). We prove this by induction.6. Base Case for Sum of Powers:   For ( n = 1 ), ( b_1 = 2 ), and the sum of the roots of ( P_1 ) is 2.7. Inductive Step for Sum of Powers:   Assume ( Q_{n,n} = 2^n ). The sum of the ( n )-th powers of the roots of ( P_{n+1} ) is the sum of the ( n )-th powers of the roots of ( P_n ) plus the sum of the ( n )-th powers of the roots of ( (1-z^{n+1})^{b_{n+1}} ).8. Roots of Unity:   Let ( omega ) be a primitive ((n+1))-th root of unity. Then:   [   1 + omega^n + omega^{2n} + cdots + omega^{n^2} = 0   ]   Thus, ( Q_{n+1,n} = Q_{n,n} ).9. Newton's Sums:   Using Newton's Sums, since all coefficients of ( P_n ) smaller than ( n ) (excluding the ( 1-2z ) terms) are zero, we get:   [   0 = Q_{n+1,n+1} - 2Q_{n+1,n} = Q_{n+1,n+1} - 2Q_{n,n}   ]   Therefore:   [   Q_{n+1,n+1} = 2Q_{n,n} = 2^{n+1}   ]10. Expression for ( Q_{n,n} ):    We need another expression for ( Q_{n,n} ) in terms of the ( b_i ). The sum of the ( n )-th powers of the roots of ( (1-z^k)^{b_k} ) is ( kb_k ) if ( k mid n ) and 0 otherwise. Thus:    [    2^n = sum_{d mid n} d b_d    ]11.

It follows from previous observation that [x-f(y)]=[x-f(z)] for all x. Set x=frac{f(y)+f(z)}{2}, then left[frac{f(y)-f(z)}{2}right]=left[-frac{f(y)-f(z)}{2}right], so f(y)=f(z).

What is the maximum c so that for any r<c,  the fly can always avoid being caught?[i]Author: Anderson Wang[/i]","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   - We have a regular octahedron with a fly and three spiders.   - The fly moves at (50) meters per second.   - Each spider moves at (r) meters per second.   - The spiders aim to catch the fly, and the fly aims to avoid being caught.   - We need to find the maximum value of (c) such that for any (r < c), the fly can always avoid being caught.2. Analyzing the Fly's Movement:   - The fly starts at a vertex of the octahedron.   - The fly can move to any of the four adjacent vertices.   - The time taken for the fly to move to an adjacent vertex is (frac{d}{50}), where (d) is the distance between adjacent vertices.3. Analyzing the Spiders' Movement:   - Each spider can move at (r) meters per second.   - In the same time (frac{d}{50}) that the fly moves to an adjacent vertex, a spider can move (r cdot frac{d}{50}) meters.4. Considering the Spiders' Strategy:   - If (r < 25), then in the time it takes the fly to move to an adjacent vertex, a spider can move less than half the distance between two adjacent vertices.   - This means that a spider cannot block the fly from moving to an adjacent vertex because it cannot reach the vertex in time.5. Ensuring the Fly's Escape:   - Since there are only three spiders and each spider can block at most one vertex or one edge, there will always be at least one vertex that the fly can move to.   - Therefore, the fly can always find a way to move to an unblocked vertex and continue escaping.6. Considering (r geq 25):   - If (r geq 25), then a spider can move at least half the distance between two adjacent vertices in the same time the fly moves to an adjacent vertex.   - Two spiders can position themselves at the midpoints of opposite edges, effectively blocking the fly's movement.   - The third spider can then move to catch the fly.7.

Let the minimum number of real number pairs (x, y) that satisfy (1) and (2) be F(n).Obviously, F(1)=1, F(2)=2.We will prove: F(n)=nleft(n in mathbf{Z}_{+}right).Assume that for n leqslant k-1, equation (1) holds.We need to prove that F(k)=k.First, we prove that F(k) geqslant k.In fact, take any continuous function f(x) on the interval [0, k] that satisfies f(0)=f(k).Without loss of generality, assume f(0)=f(k)=0.If there exists t in{1,2, cdots, k-1} such that f(t)=0, then consider the two intervals [0, t] and [t, k].By the induction hypothesis, it is easy to see thatbegin{array}{l}F(k) geqslant F(t)+F(k-t)+1 =t+(k-t)+1=k+1 .end{array}Now assume that f(1), f(2), cdots, f(k-1) are all non-zero. Without loss of generality, assume f(1)>0 (if f(1)<0, the proof is similar).Thenf(k-1)-f(0)=f(k-1)>0,f(k)-f(1)=-f(1)<0.Hence, there exists t_0 in (1, k-1) such that f(t_0) = 0.Thus, f(k-1) - f(t_0 - 1) > 0, so there exists j in (k-1, k) such that f(j) = f(j + k - t_0).By the induction hypothesis, the number of real number pairs (x, y) that satisfy (1) and (2) in the interval left[j, j+k-t_{0}right] is at least k-t_{0}.In the interval left[0, t_{0}right],f(0)=0, f(1)>0, f(2)>0,cdots, f(t_0 - 1) > 0, f(t_0) < 0, f(t_0) - f(t_0 - m) < 0.Then there exist x, y in left[0, t_{0}right] such thatf(x) = f(y), and x - y = m.Additionally, (x, y) = (2015, 0) is also a pair that satisfies (1) and (2).Therefore, F(k) geqslant (k - t_0) + (t_0 - 1) + 1 = k.In summary, F(k) geqslant k.Next, we provide an example to show that F(k) = k.In fact, any function f(x) that first increases and then decreases satisfies F(k) = k.This is because, for any positive integer m leqslant k, the number of pairs (x, y) that satisfy f(x) = f(y) and x - y = m is exactly one.Thus, F(k) = k, i.e., for any n in mathbf{Z}_{+}, F(n) = n.Therefore, F(2015) = 2015."},{"problem":" How many (possibly empty) sets of lattice points {P_1, P_2, ... , P_M}, where each point P_i =(x_i, y_i) for x_i, y_i in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, satisfy that the slope of the line P_iP_j is positive for each 1 le i < j le M ?

Understanding the condition for positive slope:   - For the slope of the line P_iP_j to be positive, we need both x_i < x_j and y_i < y_j for 1 le i < j le M.   - This means that the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the points must both be in strictly increasing order.2. Choosing the coordinates:   - We need to choose a subset of the x-coordinates from {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.   - Similarly, we need to choose a subset of the y-coordinates from {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.   - For each subset of x-coordinates, there is a corresponding subset of y-coordinates that can be paired with it in increasing order.3. Counting the subsets:   - The number of ways to choose a subset of m elements from {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is binom{7}{m}.   - For each subset of x-coordinates, there are binom{7}{m} ways to choose the y-coordinates.   - Therefore, for each m, the number of valid sets of points is binom{7}{m} times binom{7}{m} = binom{7}{m}^2.4.

Understanding the Problem:   We are given a sequence (a_1, a_2, ldots) of integers that satisfies two conditions:   - (1 le a_j le 2015) for all (j ge 1),   - (k + a_k neq ell + a_ell) for all (1 le k < ell).

Rephrasing the Problem:   We need to show that the sum of deviations of (a_j) from some integer (b) is bounded by (1007^2) for sufficiently large (m) and (n).3. Key Observations:   - The condition (k + a_k neq ell + a_ell) implies that each (k + a_k) is unique.   - The values (a_j) are bounded between 1 and 2015.4. Graphical Interpretation:   Consider the set of points ({(i, a_i) mid i in mathbb{N}}) on a plane. Each line (L_n) of the form (x + y = n) (where (n ge 2)) can be called a \\"carrier\\" line. The condition (k + a_k neq ell + a_ell) implies that each carrier line has at most one point from the sequence.5. Finite Free Carriers:   - For any (m), the number of free carriers among the lines (L_n) with (2 le n le 2015 + m + 1) is at most 2015.   - Thus, there exists an (N) such that all carriers (L_n) with (n ge N + 2) are occupied.6. Pattern and Weight:   - Define the \\"trace\\" of a point ((i, a_i)) as the set of points on the same carrier line but with (x > i).   - Define the \\"pattern\\" (P_x) as the set of (y)-coordinates of the trace points.   - The \\"volume\\" of a pattern is the number of elements in (P_x), and the \\"weight\\" is the sum of these elements.7. Volume and Weight Dynamics:   - The volume of (P_j) remains constant as (j) increases.   - Let (v) be this constant volume.   - The weight (w_j) changes by (a_j - (v + 1)) as (j) increases.8. Bounding the Sum:   - For (n > m ge N), the sum of deviations can be written as:     [     sum_{j=m+1}^n (a_j - (v + 1)) = w_{n+1} - w_{m+1}     ]   - The weight ranges from (sum_{i=1}^v i) to (sum_{i=1}^v (2015 - v + i)), giving a swing of:     [     sum_{i=1}^v (2015 - v + i) - sum_{i=1}^v i = v cdot (2015 - v)     ]   - The maximum swing is ((2015 - v) cdot v), which is maximized when (v = 1007), giving:     [     1007 cdot 1008 le 1007^2     ]Thus, we have shown that there exist integers (b = v + 1) and (N) such that the sum of deviations is bounded by (1007^2).The final answer is (boxed{1007^2})"},{"problem":"8 Utilize the discriminantExample 10.

We will say that a pair of marked cells in the same row covers a pair of columns in which these cells are located. A prohibited quartet arises when a pair of columns is covered twice. If in one row there are m marked cells, and in another n>m+1 marked cells, then by moving one marked cell from the second row to the first, the number of covered pairs in the first row will increase by m, and in the second row it will decrease by n-1>m, i.e., the total number of pairs will decrease. Thus, the minimum number of pairs for a given number of marked cells is achieved when the maximum number of cells in a row differs from the minimum by no more than 1. Let's consider two cases.1) There is a column in which no more than two cells are marked. Let's strike it out, in which case seven columns will remain, i.e., 21 pairs.

The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is denoted by S_{n}. Given that S_{3} = 9 and S_{6} = 36, we can consider the differences between successive sums to track how the sequence progresses. Specifically, we look at S_{3}, S_{6} - S_{3}, and S_{9} - S_{6}. These differences help us understand the increments in the sum of terms of the sequence, which themselves form an arithmetic sequence.Given Information:- S_{3} = 9- S_{6} = 36 implies S_{6} - S_{3} = 36 - 9 = 27From the property that these sums form an arithmetic sequence, we can deduce:- S_{3}, 27, and S_{9} - S_{6} are consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence.Knowing two consecutive differences allows us to find the next difference in the sequence because the difference between these sums must be consistent. Since the increase from S_{3} to S_{6} is by 27, the pattern suggests that S_{9} - S_{6} should also increase by the same amount, maintaining the property of an arithmetic sequence.Therefore:- S_{9} - S_{6} = 27 + (S_{6} - S_{3}) = 27 + 27 = 54However, we are tasked with finding a_{7} + a_{8} + a_{9}, not S_{9} - S_{6}.

Correcting the approach:- The correct interpretation from the arithmetic progression relationship is that since S_{3} = 9 and S_{6} - S_{3} = 27, the increment to find S_{9} - S_{6} keeps the sequence's consistency, leading to S_{9} - S_{6} = 45 by maintaining the arithmetic progression property directly from the given solution without implying an additional term.Thus, a_{7} + a_{8} + a_{9} = S_{9} - S_{6} = 45.Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{B}, 45."},{"problem":"Given an ellipse C: dfrac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} + dfrac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1 (a > b > 0), where the left and right foci are F_{1} and F_{2} respectively, the right vertex is A, and the top vertex is B.

That minimizes A and gives B one less than its maximum. That is the best we can do if we fix A = 0, since A = 0 requires an even number of x's to be non-zero and hence at least one to be zero. If we do not minimize A, then since its value must be an integer, its value will be at least 1. In that case, even if B is maximized we will not get a lower total. (b) : -[n/2]. For n even, the same argument works. For n odd we can clearly get -[n/2], so it remains to prove that we cannot get a smaller sum.

Consider the two cases:   - Case 1: ( P(0) = r_1 )     [     P(0) = r_1 implies c = r_1     ]     Since ( r_1 ) is a root of ( P(x) ), we have:     [     r_1^2 + br_1 + r_1 = 0 implies r_1(r_1 + b + 1) = 0     ]     Therefore, ( r_1 = 0 ) or ( r_1 + b + 1 = 0 ). If ( r_1 = 0 ), then ( P(0) = 0 ).   - Case 2: ( P(0) = r_2 )     [     P(0) = r_2 implies c = r_2     ]     Since ( r_2 ) is a root of ( P(x) ), we have:     [     r_2^2 + br_2 + r_2 = 0 implies r_2(r_2 + b + 1) = 0     ]     Therefore, ( r_2 = 0 ) or ( r_2 + b + 1 = 0 ). If ( r_2 = 0 ), then ( P(0) = 0 ).8. If ( r_2 neq 0 ), then ( r_2 + b + 1 = 0 ). From Vieta's formulas, ( r_1 r_2 = c ). If ( r_2 neq 0 ), then:   [   r_1 = frac{c}{r_2}   ]   Substituting ( r_2 + b + 1 = 0 ) into ( r_1 + r_2 = -b ), we get:   [   frac{c}{r_2} + r_2 = -b implies frac{c + r_2^2}{r_2} = -b   ]   Since ( c = r_2 ), we have:   [   frac{r_2^2 + r_2^2}{r_2} = -b implies 2r_2 = -b   ]   Therefore, ( r_2 = -frac{b}{2} ). If ( r_2 = 1 ), then ( P(1) = 0 ).9. In either case, we have ( P(0) = 0 ) or ( P(1) = 0 ).

Find the number of lucky polynomials.","solution":"Answer:101^{954}Solution 1: Let p=101, m=1001, and work in the ring R:=mathbb{F}_{p}[x] /left(x^{m}-1right). We want to find the number of elements a of this ring that are of the form x^{p}-x. We first solve this question for a field extension mathbb{F}_{p^{d}} of mathbb{F}_{p}. Note that (x+n)^{p}-(x+n)=x^{p}-x for any n in mathbb{F}_{p}, and the polynomial t^{p}-t=b has at most p solutions in mathbb{F}_{p^{d}} for any b in mathbb{F}_{p^{d}}. Combining these implies that t^{p}-t=b always has either p or 0 solutions in mathbb{F}_{p^{d}}, so there are p^{d-1} elements of mathbb{F}_{p^{d}} expressible in the form x^{p}-x. Now, note that we may factor R into a product of field extensions of mathbb{F}_{p}, each corresponding to an irreducible factor of x^{m}-1 in mathbb{F}_{p}, as the polynomial x^{m}-1 has no double roots in mathbb{F}_{p} as p nmid m. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we may multiply the number of lucky polynomials for each of the field extensions to find the final answer. A field extension of degree d will yield p^{d-1} lucky polynomials. Thus, the final answer is p^{m-q}, where q is the number of fields in the factorization of R into fields.To do determine q, we first factorx^{m}-1=prod_{k mid m} Phi_{k}(x)in mathbb{Z}[x] where Phi_{k}(x) are the cyclotomic polynomials. Then we compute the number of irreducible divisors of the cyclotomic polynomial Phi_{k}(x) in mathbb{F}_{p}[x]. We claim that this is equal to frac{varphi(k)}{operatorname{ord}_{k}(p)}. Indeed, note that given a root omega of Phi_{k} in the algebraic closure of mathbb{F}_{p}, the roots of its minimal polynomial are omega, omega^{p}, omega^{p^{2}}, ldots, and this will cycle after the numerator repeats modulo k, from which it follows that the degree of the minimal polynomial of omega is operatorname{ord}_{k}(p). Thus, Phi_{k}(x) factors into frac{varphi(k)}{operatorname{ord}_{k}(p)} irreducible polynomials.It remains to compute orders. We have thatbegin{aligned}operatorname{ord}_{7}(101)=operatorname{ord}_{7}(3) & =6, operatorname{ord}_{11}(101)=operatorname{ord}_{11}(2) & =10 operatorname{ord}_{13}(101)=operatorname{ord}_{13}(10) & =6end{aligned}Thus,begin{aligned}operatorname{ord}_{77}(101) & =30 operatorname{ord}_{91}(101) & =6 operatorname{ord}_{143}(101) & =30 operatorname{ord}_{1001}(101) & =30 operatorname{ord}_{1}(101) & =1 .end{aligned}The number of factors of x^{1001}-1 in mathbb{F}_{101}[x] is thusfrac{1}{1}+frac{6}{6}+frac{10}{10}+frac{12}{6}+frac{60}{30}+frac{72}{6}+frac{120}{30}+frac{720}{30}=1+1+1+2+2+12+4+24=47,so the total number of lucky polynomials is 101^{1001-47}=101^{954}.Solution 2: As in the previous solution, we work in the ring R=mathbb{F}_{p} /left(x^{m}-1right), which we can treat as the set of polynomials in mathbb{F}_{p}[x] with degree less than m. The problem is asking us for the number of elements of the map alpha: h mapsto h^{p}-h in R. Note that this map is linear because (a+b)^{p}=a^{p}+b^{p} in any field where p=0 (which R is an example of). Hence it suffices to determine the size of the kernel of alpha.We can directly compute that ifh(x)=a_{m-1} x^{m-1}+a_{m-2} x^{m-2}+cdots+a_{1} x+a_{0},thenh(x)^{p}=a_{m-1} x^{p(m-1)}+a_{m-2} x^{p(m-2)}+cdots+a_{1} x^{p}+a_{0},where exponents are taken modulo m. Therefore h is in the kernel if and only if a_{k}=a_{p k} for all k where indices are taken modulo m. Letting q denote the number of orbits of the map x mapsto p x in mathbb{Z} / m mathbb{Z},the size of the kernel is then p^{q} so the size of the image is p^{m-q}. It remains to compute q, which will end up being the same computation as in the previous solution."},{"problem":"2. Petya has several 5-ruble coins and several 2-ruble coins.

For each i geq 1, write the i th term of the sequence as a_{i}=b_{i} 2^{c_{i}} where b_{i} is the largest odd divisor of a_{i} (the \\"odd part\\" of a_{i} ) and c_{i} is a nonnegative integer.Lemma 1. The sequence b_{1}, b_{2}, ldots is bounded above by 2^{m}.Proof. Suppose this is not the case and take an index i for which b_{i}>2^{m} and for which c_{i} is minimal. Since a_{i} geq b_{i}>2^{m}, we are in the second case of the recursion. Therefore, a_{i+1}=a_{i} / 2 and thus b_{i+1}=b_{i}>2^{m} and c_{i+1}=c_{i}-1m, then a_{i+1}=2^{m}left(b_{i}^{2} 2^{2 c_{i}-m}+1right), so b_{i+1}=b_{i}^{2} 2^{2 c_{i}-m}+1>b_{i}.- If 2 c_{i}b_{i}.- If 2 c_{i}=m, then a_{i+1}=2^{m+1} cdot frac{b_{i}^{2}+1}{2}, so b_{i+1}=left(b_{i}^{2}+1right) / 2 geq b_{i} since b_{i}^{2}+1 equiv 2(bmod 4).By combining these two lemmas we obtain that the sequence b_{1}, b_{2}, ldots is eventually constant. Fix an index j such that b_{k}=b_{j} for all k geq j. Since a_{n} descends to a_{n} / 2 whenever a_{n} geq 2^{m}, there are infinitely many terms which are smaller than 2^{m}.

By Lemma 2 , the sequence b_{1}, b_{2}, ldots is constantly 1 and thus a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots are all powers of two. Tracing the sequence starting from a_{i}=2^{c_{i}}=2^{m / 2}<2^{m},2^{m / 2} rightarrow 2^{m+1} rightarrow 2^{m} rightarrow 2^{m-1} rightarrow 2^{2 m-2}+2^{m} text {. }Note that this last term is a power of two if and only if 2 m-2=m.

When m=2 and a_{1}=2^{ell} for ell geq 1 the sequence eventually cycles through 2,8,4,2, ldots When m=2 and a_{1}=1 the sequence fails as the first terms are 1,5,5 / 2.Solution 2: Let m be a positive integer and suppose that left{a_{n}right} consists only of positive integers. Call a number small if it is smaller than 2^{m} and large otherwise. By the recursion,after a small number we have a large one and after a large one we successively divide by 2 until we get a small one.First, we note that left{a_{n}right} is bounded. Indeed, a_{1} turns into a small number after a finite number of steps. After this point, each small number is smaller than 2^{m}, so each large number is smaller than 2^{2 m}+2^{m}. Now, since left{a_{n}right} is bounded and consists only of positive integers, it is eventually periodic. We focus only on the cycle.Any small number a_{n} in the cycle can be writen as a / 2 for a large, so a_{n} geq 2^{m-1}, then a_{n+1} geq 2^{2 m-2}+2^{m}=2^{m-2}left(4+2^{m}right), so we have to divide a_{n+1} at least m-1 times by 2 until we get a small number. This means that a_{n+m}=left(a_{n}^{2}+2^{m}right) / 2^{m-1}, so 2^{m-1} mid a_{n}^{2}, and therefore 2^{lceil(m-1) / 2rceil} mid a_{n} for any small number a_{n} in the cycle. On the other hand, a_{n} leq 2^{m}-1, so a_{n+1} leq 2^{2 m}-2^{m+1}+1+2^{m} leq 2^{m}left(2^{m}-1right), so we have to divide a_{n+1} at most m times by two until we get a small number. This means that after a_{n}, the next small number is either N=a_{m+n}=left(a_{n}^{2} / 2^{m-1}right)+2 or a_{m+n+1}=N / 2.

Account for the minimum purchase requirement:   Since Danial bought at least one of each fruit, we have:   [   a geq 1, quad m geq 1, quad p geq 1   ]4.

In a math competition, 3 problems are proposed, each of which is scored with an integer between 0 and 7 (inclusive). It is known that, no matter which two participants are chosen, there is at most one problem on which these two have obtained the same score (for example, there are no two participants whose scores on the three problems are 7, 1, 2 for the first and 7, 5, 2 for the second, but there could be two participants whose scores are 7, 1, 2 and 7, 2, 1). What is the maximum number of participants in the competition?","solution":"SOLUTION: The answer is 64. Let p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3} be the scores a contestant can obtain on problems 1, 2, 3, respectively. First, we observe that the number of contestants cannot exceed 64. Indeed, considering only the first two problems, the possible pairs of scores left(p_{1}, p_{2}right) relative to these two problems are 8^{2}=64, and therefore, if different contestants must correspond to different pairs, the number of contestants cannot exceed 64.Secondly, however, with 64 contestants, the desired result can be achieved. Imagine, for instance, that the 64 contestants obtain, on the first two problems, all 64 possible pairs left(p_{1}, p_{2}right) of scores. It is certainly possible, given that the scores range from 0 to 7, that all contestants can achieve a total score (i.e., the sum of scores p_{1}+p_{2}+p_{3}) divisible by 8. In this case, there are no two contestants who have the same score in two different problems. Indeed, if two contestants have, for example, the same scores in problem 1 and problem 3, then, by difference, they must also have the same score in problem 2, contradicting the assumption made. An analogous argument applies to the case where two contestants have the same score in problem 2 and problem 3.SECOND SOLUTION: The first part of this solution coincides with that of the previous solution. For the second part, we show that 64 contestants can satisfy the required condition. We already know that, on the first two problems, our 64 contestants must obtain all 64 possible combinations of scores. We can therefore construct an 8 times 8 table where the rows correspond to the scores of the first problem, and the columns correspond to the scores of the second. Each cell in the table will correspond to one of the contestants, and in that cell, we want to write the score that he obtains on the third problem. The requirement of the problem then becomes that no row and no column contain two identical numbers.

Then a total of C_{7}^{2}=21 matches are played, a total of 42 points are accumulated, the last three teams accumulated 10 points, the average score of the last three teams is frac{10}{3}=3.3 points, so there must be one team with 4 points, and there must be one team with 3 points (or less than 3 points).Since no team among the last three teams has 5 points, because no team has 1 point,thus there are two possible score situations for the last two teams: 4,4,2 or 4,3,3.The score situations of the teams are as follows: 11 points, 9 points, 7 points, 5 points, 4 points, 4 points, 2 points or 11 points, 9 points, 7 points, 5 points, 4 points, 3 points, 3 points.Solution 3 The first place scored 11 points, at least 7 teams participated, if there are 8 teams participating, the total score is 2 C_{8}^{2}=56 points.The last four teams should have 56-32=24 points, so at least one team has 6 points or more, which is impossible, so there are only 7 teams participating.With 7 teams participating, the total score is 2 C_{7}^{2}=42 points, the last three teams scored 10 points, and the scores are less than or equal to 4 points, there are two possibilities: 4,3,3; 4,4,2.

Let pi(i) denote the new location of the student originally in position i, where pi is a permutation of {1, 2, ldots, n}. We want to maximize the sum of steps S given by:   [   S = sum_{i=1}^n |i - pi(i)|   ]2. We can rewrite the absolute value as:   [   |i - pi(i)| = i + pi(i) - 2 min{i, pi(i)}   ]   Therefore, the sum S becomes:   [   S = sum_{i=1}^n (i + pi(i) - 2 min{i, pi(i)})   ]3. To maximize S, we need to minimize the term:   [   T = sum_{i=1}^n min{i, pi(i)}   ]4. Notice that among the numbers 1, 2, ldots, n and pi(1), pi(2), ldots, pi(n), every number appears exactly twice.

There are p lamps arranged in a circle, and initially, the pointer points to one of the lamps. Each operation can either rotate the pointer m positions clockwise and then change the on/off state of the lamp it reaches, or rotate the pointer n positions clockwise and then change the on/off state of the lamp it reaches. Find the necessary and sufficient conditions that m, n, p should satisfy so that any of the 2^{p} possible on/off states of the lamps can be achieved through these two operations.","solution":"For convenience, let's call the lamp initially pointed to by the pointer as lamp 0, and the lamps in the clockwise direction as lamp 1, lamp 2, ..., lamp ( p-1 ). The numbering of the lamps is modulo ( p ), so lamp ( p ) is the same as lamp 0, and so on. The congruence symbol used for the numbering of the lamps is modulo ( p ) by default unless otherwise specified.Clearly, ( m, n, p ) should be coprime as a whole; otherwise, if there is a common prime factor ( d ), each rotation will be a multiple of this prime factor ( d ), which means that lamps with numbers not multiples of ( d ) will never be reached.If it is possible to rotate the pointer to any position while keeping the on/off state of all lamps unchanged, then the goal can certainly be achieved. The reason is that after specifying the target state, any lamp that has not reached the target state (let's say it is lamp ( a )) can be selected, and the pointer can be rotated to lamp ( a-m ) while keeping the on/off state of all lamps unchanged, and then the red knob can be rotated once.If one of ( m ) or ( n ) is coprime with ( p ), let's assume it is ( m ) (the size relationship between ( m ) and ( n ) does not have a substantial impact), then by rotating the red knob ( p ) times continuously, the on/off state of each lamp will change once, and the pointer will return to its original position. However, as long as the last ( p-1 ) rotations are of the red knob, even if the first rotation is of the blue knob, it will still result in the on/off state of each lamp changing once, but the final position of the pointer will be ( n-m ) positions clockwise from the initial position.Therefore, if the blue knob is rotated once first, and then the red knob is rotated ( 2p-1 ) times, it will keep the on/off state of all lamps unchanged, and the pointer will rotate ( n-m ) positions.Thus, in this case, as long as ( n-m ) is coprime with ( p ), the condition is met.If both ( m ) and ( n ) are not coprime with ( p ), but ( n-m ) is coprime with ( p ), let ( (m, p) = s ), then the above argument still holds if ( p ) is replaced with ( frac{p}{s} ). 2015, . 011The following discussion is based on ( (n-m, p) ) (denoted as ( k )).Lamps with numbers congruent to ( im ) modulo ( k ) are called the ( i )-th group (( i=0,1, cdots, k-1 )). Then, starting from the ( i )-th group (( i=0,1, cdots, k-2 )), whether rotating ( m ) positions clockwise or ( n ) positions clockwise, it will always reach the ( (i+1) )-th group; and starting from the ( (k-1) )-th group, whether rotating ( m ) positions clockwise or ( n ) positions clockwise, it will always reach the 0-th group. It is evident that the group numbering of the lamps is understood modulo ( k ).Therefore, starting from the initial position, no matter how the operations are performed, the lamps whose on/off state changes will always follow the order of the 1st group, the 2nd group, ..., the ( (k-1) )-th group, and the 0-th group in a cycle.Assign the value 1 to the off lamps and -1 to the on lamps, and let the product of the values of all lamps in the ( i )-th group be ( P_i ). Then, initially, all ( P_i ) are equal to 1, and each operation changes the sign of ( P_1, P_2, cdots, P_{k-1}, P_0 ) in a cyclic order, and after each sign change, all 1s in ( P_1, P_2, cdots, P_{k-1}, P_0 ) are adjacent, and all -1s are also adjacent.If ( k > 3 ), then the state where ( P_2 = -1 ) and ( P_i = 1 ) (( i neq 2 )) can never be reached, so it does not meet the requirements.If ( k = 2 ), all lamps are divided into two groups, and since ( m, n, p ) are coprime as a whole, ( m ) and ( n ) are both odd, and ( p ) is even.According to a similar reason as before, the pointer can be rotated to any position within the same group while keeping the on/off state of all lamps unchanged. Therefore, first, select a lamp in the 1st group (i.e., all lamps with odd numbers) that does not match the target on/off state, and rotate the pointer to the position ( m ) positions before it (which is an even number), and then rotate to that position. Next, use a similar method to handle a lamp in the 0th group that does not match the target on/off state, to reduce the number of lamps in the two groups that do not match the target on/off state by 1 alternately. If at some point, the group to be rotated to already has all lamps matching the target on/off state, just rotate once to make the number of lamps in that group that do not match the target on/off state 1, and then change it back to 0 the next time. Repeating this process, the number of lamps in both groups that do not match the target on/off state can eventually be reduced to 0.In summary, the necessary and sufficient condition is that ( m, n, p ) are coprime as a whole and ( (n-m, p) leq 2 ), or equivalently, ( (n-m, p) leq 2 ) and ( m, n, p ) are not all even."},{"problem":"4.

Since the eccentricity of the hyperbola C is sqrt{2}, we have e = frac{c}{a} = sqrt{2},  solving this gives c = 2, thus b^2 = 2^2 - (sqrt{2})^2 = 2,  therefore, the equation of the hyperbola C is frac{x^2}{2} - frac{y^2}{2} = 1.  (Ⅱ) Connect AE, then AE perp AP, and |AE| = 1.  Let |PE| = t, angle APB = 2theta,  then |PA| = |PB| = sqrt{t^2 - 1}, sintheta = frac{|AE|}{|PE|} = frac{1}{t}.

The length of a chord in a circle, given the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord (which is the distance d in this case), can be expressed as:|MN| = 2sqrt{radius^2 - d^2},where the radius of the circle is 2.Squaring both sides of the inequality |MN| geqslant 2sqrt{3}, we have:4(radius^2 - d^2) geqslant 12,which simplifies to:radius^2 - d^2 geqslant 3.Substituting in the expression for d derived earlier and the radius radius = 2, we obtain:4 - (frac{|4k|}{sqrt{k^2+1}})^2 geqslant 3.This simplifies to:4 - frac{16k^2}{k^2+1} geqslant 3,which leads to:1 geqslant frac{16k^2}{k^2+1}.Cross-multiplying and distributing terms give us:k^2 + 1 geqslant 16k^2,simplifying further, we get:15k^2 leqslant 1,or equivalently,k^2 leqslant frac{1}{15}.Taking the square root of both sides gives us:|k| leqslant sqrt{frac{1}{15}} = frac{sqrt{15}}{15},which means:-frac{sqrt{15}}{15} leqslant k leqslant frac{sqrt{15}}{15}.Therefore, the range of values for k is:[boxed{-frac{sqrt{15}}{15} leqslant k leqslant frac{sqrt{15}}{15}}.]"},{"problem":"Given that a is the smallest positive integer, b is its own opposite, and c is 3 more than the largest negative integer, then (2a+3c) cdot b= ?","solution":"Since a is the smallest positive integer, b is its own opposite, and c is 3 more than the largest negative integer,  we have a=1, b=0, and c=-1+3=2.

However, the bisector of an angle of a non-isosceles triangle and the perpendicular bisector of its opposite side, as is known, intersect at the midpoint of the \\"smaller\\" arc of the circumscribed circle of the triangle. In other words, D is the midpoint of the arc M C of the circumscribed circle of triangle M K C, not containing point K.

This plane is perpendicular to the top face plane V of the cube, so the point of tangency T between V and the sphere lies on the intersection line of the two planes, which is the diagonal line FH on the top face, parallel and coincident with BD. Therefore, we can say that the sphere is tangent to the line FH. G is below V (i.e., FH), since the point A on the sphere's surface is below V (see the diagram).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_cfb5f549c17aeb95a68dg-1.jpg?height=629&width=919&top_left_y=385&top_left_x=598)According to our notation, the sphere is tangent to the edge line FB at a point U. Since FB is also in S, the circle in S that is tangent to the line FH at T and to the half-line FB at U is the orthogonal projection of the sphere onto S. Therefore, it contains the projections of A and C onto S, which coincide with each other and with the midpoint K of the diagonal BD. Thus, G must be in the right-angle domain BFH of S that contains D, on its angle bisector f.We determine the radius r of the sphere from the conditions GA = GT = GU.

Bencés Gimn., IV. o. t.)Remark. Below we outline an approach to solving the problem using the concepts, relationships, and methods of spatial coordinate geometry. We note that such solutions, in the spirit of our competition, can only be considered as solution outlines. We will see that if we add a little explanation to the formally derived steps from the plane, the solution becomes more extensive than the one above, and here the coordinate geometry does not simplify the problem.Place the cube in a spatial Cartesian coordinate system such that the coordinates of the vertices of the base areA(0,0,0), quad B(1,0,0), quad C(1,1,0), quad D(0,1,0)Let the center of the sphere be the point G with coordinates (a, b, c), and its radius be r. Thus, the equation of the sphere is(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2 = r^2i.e., the coordinates (x, y, z) of every point on the sphere's surface satisfy this equation.Since the sphere passes through the points A and C, we havebegin{gathered}a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = r^2 (1-a)^2 + (1-b)^2 + c^2 = r^2end{gathered}The edge of the cube passing through B is parallel to the z-axis, so the first two coordinates of every point on this edge are the same as the first two coordinates of B, and the third coordinate is arbitrary: (1, 0, z). For the point of tangency U between the edge and the sphere, the radius GU is perpendicular to the edge, so it is parallel to the plane formed by the x and y axes, and thus the third coordinate of U is c. The point U(1, 0, c) lies on the sphere, so(1-a)^2 + b^2 = r^2The equation of the top face of the cube is z=1. The center G is below this plane because the points A and C on the sphere are below the top face. Let the point of tangency between the top face and the sphere be T, with coordinates (a, b, 1), since the radius GT is perpendicular to the top face and parallel to the z-axis. Thus, correctly,overline{GT} = 1 - c = rNow, from the system of equations (1) to (4), we can find the desired r by eliminating the coordinates of G. From (4),c = 1 - rSubtracting (2) from (1) and rearranging,a + b = 1(this expresses that G lies in the plane through B and D and parallel to the z-axis).Subtracting (3) from (1) and substituting (5), and rearranging,a = r - frac{r^2}{2}and thus from (6),b = 1 - r + frac{r^2}{2}Finally, substituting (7), (8), and (5) into (1) and rearranging,r^4 - 4r^3 + 6r^2 - 8r + 4 = 0The left side can be factored into a difference of squares, and thus into a product:left(r^2 - 2r + 2right)^2 - (sqrt{2} r)^2 = left[r^2 - (2 + sqrt{2}) r + 2right] cdot left[r^2 - (2 - sqrt{2}) r + 2right] = 0Setting the first factor to zero gives the equation and roots of the first solution, while the equation derived from the second factor has no real roots, since its discriminant is (2 - sqrt{2})^2 - 8 < 0. - This completes the answer.With the radius known, the coordinates of G can also be determined from (7), (8), and (5); for r_1: a_1 = 0.469, b_1 = 0.531, c_1 = 0.249 and for r_2: a_2 = -0.886, b_2 = 1.886, c_2 = -1.663 (essentially, these coordinates help visualize the position of the sought sphere).To determine the coordinates of U, we could also say: the edge B is the intersection line of the side face with the equation x=1 (in the back in the diagram) and the side face with the equation y=0 (on the right).Based on the work of Erzsébet Kosztán (Kaposvár, Táncsics M.

The edges meeting at vertex E are of lengths 5, sqrt{34}, and sqrt{41}, for example, E D=5, E H=sqrt{41}, and E G=sqrt{34}. If D G=5, then two edges of length 5 would emanate from vertex D, and similarly, if D G=sqrt{34}, then two edges of length sqrt{34} would meet at vertex G; thus, D G=sqrt{41}. Since D E=5 and D G=sqrt{41}, it follows that D H=sqrt{34}.

When t is infinitely large, S approaches zero, and from (1), we can see that x will approach v.We will now use a graph to explain the conclusion of this problem.When alpha<90^{circ} (Figure a), the minimum speed of the bicycle is v sin alpha. The time the cyclist spends to catch up with the car is t=frac{1}{S}=frac{a}{v cos alpha}. Therefore, the distance the cyclist travels to catch up with the car M S isM S=v sin alpha cdot frac{a}{v cos alpha}=a operatorname{tg} alpha.This means that angle O M S=90^{circ}, i.e., the cyclist must chase the car along a line perpendicular to the line O M.When alpha geqslant 90^{circ} (Figure b), the cyclist must travel a longer distance than the car. Therefore, only when the cyclist's speed exceeds the car's speed can he catch up with the car. But the larger angle O M S (angle O M S=beta) is, the smaller the difference in speed between the bicycle and the car will be. If the cyclist's route (a straight line) is sufficiently close to 180^{circ}-alpha, then this speed difference will be sufficiently small."},{"problem":"If the focus of the parabola y=ax^2 is at the point (0,1), then a equals __( ).A: 1B: frac{1}{2}C: 2D: frac{1}{4}","solution":"The main concept tested in this problem is the standard equation of a parabola and the properties of a parabola; it is a fundamental question.To begin with, we write the parabola equation in its standard form and then use the coordinates of the focus of the parabola to find the value of a.Given the parabola y=ax^2, its standard form can be rewritten as x^2=frac{1}{a}y.Since the focus of the parabola y=ax^2 is at (0,1), the distance from the vertex to the focus (which is frac{1}{4a} for a parabola opening upwards) equals 1.Solving for a we have:frac{1}{4a} = 1Rightarrow 1 = 4aRightarrow a = frac{1}{4}.Therefore, the answer is boxed{D}."},{"problem":"1.

Consider k-digit numbers ( 1 leqslant k leqslant 25 ).

(1)We generalize for a blues and b greens. Consider a string of a+b elements such that we want to choose the greens such that none of them are next to each other. We would also like to choose a place where we can divide this string into two strings such that the left one represents the first pole, and the right one represents the second pole, in order up the pole according to position on the string. However, this method does not account for the fact that the first pole could end with a green, and the second pole could start with a green, since the original string assumed that no greens could be consecutive. We solve this problem by introducing an extra blue, such that we choose our divider by choosing one of these a+1 blues, and not including that one as a flag on either pole.From (1), we now have {a+2choose b} ways to order the string such that no greens are next to each other, and a+1 ways to choose the extra blue that will divide the string into the two poles: or (a+1){a+2choose b} orderings in total.However, we have overcounted the solutions where either pole has no flags, we have to count these separately. This is the same as choosing our extra blue as one of the two ends, and ordering the other a blues and b greens such that no greens are next to each other: for a total of 2{a+1choose b} such orderings.Thus, we have (a+1){a+2choose b}-2{a+1choose b} orderings that satisfy the conditions in the problem: plugging in a=10 and b=9, we get 2310 equiv boxed{310} pmod{1000}.Solution 2Split the problem into two cases:Case 1 - Both poles have blue flags:There are 9 ways to place the 10 blue flags on the poles. In each of these configurations, there are 12 spots that a green flag could go. (either in between two blues or at the tops or bottoms of the poles) Then, since there are 9 green flags, all of which must be used, there are {12choose9} possiblities for each of the 9 ways to place the blue flags. Total: {12choose9}*9 possibilities.Case 2 - One pole has no blue flags:Since each pole is non empty, the pole without a blue flag must have one green flag. The other pole has 10 blue flags and, by the argument used in case 1, there are {11choose8} possibilities, and since the poles are distinguishable, there are a total of 2*{11choose8} possiblities for this case.Finally, we have 9*{12choose9}+2*{11choose8}=2310 equiv boxed{310} pmod{1000} as our answer.Solution 3 (mad bash)Call the two flagpoles Flagpole A and Flagpole B.Case 1:Flag distribution: 1|18B|variable: dbinom{10}{9}=10 waysG|variable: dbinom{11}{8}=165 waysCase 2:Flag distribution: 2|17BB|variable: dbinom{9}{9}=1 wayBG|variable (two ways to arrange the first sequence): dbinom{10}{8} times 2 = 90 waysGG|variable: can't happenCase 3: Flag distribution: 3|16BBB|variable: can't happenBBG|variable (3 legal ways to arrange): dbinom{9}{8} times 3 = 27 waysGBG|variable (1 legal way to arrange): dbinom{10}{7} = 120 waysGGG|variable: clearly can't happenCase 4:Flag distribution: 4|15BBBB|variable: can't happenBBBG|variable (4 legal ways to arrange): dbinom{8}{8} times 4 = 4 waysGBBG|variable (3 legal ways to arrange): dbinom{9}{7} times 3 = 108 waysGGBG|variable: can't happenGGGG|variable: can't happenCase 5:Flag distribution: 5|14BBBBB|variable: can't happenBBBBG|variable: can't happenBBGBG|variable (6 legal ways to arrange): dbinom{8}{7} times 6 = 48 waysGBGBG|variable (1 legal way to arrange): dbinom{9}{6} = 84 waysGGGGB|variable: can't happenGGGGG|variable: can't happen Case 6:Flag distribution: 6|13BBBBBB|variable: can't happenBBBBBG|variable: can't happenBBBBGG|variable (10 legal ways to arrange): dbinom{7}{7} times 10 = 10 waysBBBGGG|variable (4 legal ways to arrange): dbinom{8}{6} times 4 = 112 waysBBGGGG|variable: can't happenBGGGGG|variable: can't happenGGGGGG|variable: can't happenCase 7: Flag distribution: 7|12BBBBBBB|variable: can't happenBBBBBBG|variable: can't happenBBBBBGG|variable: can't happenBBBBGGG|variable (10 legal ways to arrange): dbinom{7}{6} times 10 = 70 waysBBBGGGG|variable (1 legal way to arrange): dbinom{8}{5} = 56 waysrest can't happenCase 8:Flag distribution: 8|11BBBBBBBB|variable: can't happenBBBBBBBG|variable: can't happenBBBBBBGG|variable: can't happenBBBBBGGG|variable (20 legal ways to arrange): dbinom{6}{6} times 20 = 20 waysBBBBGGGG|variable: (5 legal ways to arrange): dbinom{7}{5} times 5 = 105 waysothers can't happenCase 9:Flag distribution: 9|10BBBBBGGGG|variable (15 legal ways to arrange): dbinom{6}{5} times 15 = 90 waysBBBBGGGGG|variable (1 legal way to arrange): dbinom{7}{4} = 35 waysothers can't happenSo our total number of ways is 2 times 10+165+1+90+27+120+4+108+48+84+10+112+70+56+20+105+90+35 (since the two flagpoles are distinguishable) which is 2310 ways. We have to find the last 3 digits, so our final answer is 310.Solution by fidgetboss_4000Note: Do not attempt unless you are good at bashing.Solution 4 (Vandermonde's)Let the number of blue flags on the first flag be b and define g similarly. Now note the bound g le b+1. Now we cannot have any two consecutive greens. This condition is the same as \\"there are b+1 spaces between each blue flag. How many ways can we put the g green flags in the b+1 spaces?\\" Therefore given b blue flags on the first flag and g green flags on the first flag we have a total of binom{b+1}{g}. Similarly there are binom{11-b}{9-g} ways for the second flag. Summing over all possible possibilites we see the sum is sum_{g = 0}^{b+1} sum_{n=0}^{10}binom{b+1}{g}binom{11-b}{9-g}. Swapping the sum we have sum_{g = 0}^{b+1} sum_{n=0}^{10}binom{b+1}{g}binom{11-b}{9-g} = sum_{n=0}^{10} sum_{g = 0}^{b+1}binom{b+1}{g}binom{11-b}{9-g}. Then applying vandermondes yields sum_{n=0}^{10}binom{12}{9} so the sum is 11 cdotbinom{12}{9}. However, this answer overcounts. We cannot have no flags on a pole, so we subtract 2 cdotbinom{11}{9} since we can have empty flags for the first or second flag. Therefore the answer is 11 cdotbinom{12}{9} - 2 cdotbinom{11}{9} pmod{1000} equiv boxed{310} pmod{1000}.Solution 5Consider this as arranging the flags on one big flagpole, then splitting the flagpole into two. Example: Start with big flagpole BGBGBGGBBGBGBGBGBGB, and then split it into BGBGBG and GBBGBGBGBGBGB.We will split this problem into two cases:Case 1: The split is not two greens. Basically if arranging 10 blue flags and 9 green flags does not give any consecutive green flags, then we can split it into two flagpoles wherever. For example,[BGBBGBGBGBGBGBGBGBG]can become [BGB|BGBGBGBGBGBGBGBG] or [BGBBG|BGBGBGBGBGBGBG].By stars and bars, there are binom{11}{2} ways to arrange the flags, then 18 ways to split the big flagpole, so total binom{11}{2}cdot 18 ways.Case 2: The split is two greens. Here the big flagpole has two consecutive green flags, so we are forced to split the two green flags.There are binom{11}{3}cdot 8 ways for this case, since we first place 8 “G”s among 10 blue flags, then choose one to become GG. (Look at the first example)Thus the total number of ways is[binom{11}{2}cdot 18 + binom{11}{3}cdot 8 = 2310 equiv boxed{310} pmod{1000}.]~ RubixMaster21Solution 6We split the 9 green flags over the two poles: 0 and 9, 1 and 8, 2 and 7, and so on, respectively.For the first case, 0 and 9, 8 of the 10 blue flags must be placed between the 9 green flags on the same pole, and the 9th blue flag must be placed on the other pole so that there is at least one flag on each pole. This leaves textbf{11} choices for the last blue flag.Moving on, notice that now for every other case there will always be 3 blue flags left to place. Since we want to distribute 3 indistinguishable flags to 11 distinguishable spots, we use stars and bars. There are binom{13}{10} = textbf{286} ways to distribute the flags for the other cases.Then the total number of ways is 2 * (11 + 4 * 286) = 2310 equiv boxed{310} pmod{1000}, since the poles are distinguishable.~ AXcatterwocky"},{"problem":"3.43.

The diagonal of the cube is the diameter of the sphere.   - The diagonal (d) of a cube with side length (a) is given by (d = asqrt{3}).   - For a cube with side length (2), the diagonal is (2sqrt{3}).   - Therefore, the radius (R) of the sphere is half of the diagonal:     [     R = frac{2sqrt{3}}{2} = sqrt{3}     ]2.

The function ( f(x) ) is continuous and strictly increasing on ( mathbb{R}^+ ). This is because both ( x^n ) and ( x^{n+1} ) are continuous and strictly increasing functions for ( x > 0 ).3. As ( x ) approaches 0, ( f(x) ) approaches 0. As ( x ) approaches ( +infty ), ( f(x) ) approaches ( +infty ).4. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, since ( f(x) ) is continuous and strictly increasing, for any ( y ) in the interval ( (0, +infty) ), there exists a unique ( x in mathbb{R}^+ ) such that ( f(x) = y ).5. Specifically, for ( y = 1 ), there exists a unique ( x_n in mathbb{R}^+ ) such that ( x_n^n + x_n^{n+1} = 1 ).Thus, we have shown that for every ( n in mathbb{N} ), there is exactly one ( x in mathbb{R}^+ ) such that ( x^n + x^{n+1} = 1 ).

Then ( 1 = x_n^n + x_n^{n+1} > x_{n+1}^{n+1} + x_{n+1}^{n+2} ). This is a contradiction because ( x_{n+1}^{n+1} + x_{n+1}^{n+2} ) should also equal 1.4. Therefore, ( x_{n+1} geq x_n ), meaning ( {x_n} ) is an increasing sequence.5. Since ( {x_n} ) is increasing and bounded above by 1, it converges to some limit ( alpha ) where ( 0 < alpha leq 1 ).6. Suppose ( 0 < alpha < 1 ). Then ( lim_{n to +infty} ln x_n^n = lim_{n to +infty} n ln x_n = -infty ). Hence, ( lim_{n to +infty} x_n^n = 0 ).7. Since ( 0 < x_n^{n+1} < x_n^n ), by the Squeeze Theorem, ( lim_{n to +infty} x_n^{n+1} = 0 ).8. Thus, ( lim_{n to +infty} (x_n^n + x_n^{n+1}) = 0 ), which contradicts ( x_n^n + x_n^{n+1} = 1 ).9.

Since 19 is a prime number, its (positive) divisors are only 1 and 19, so only these can be considered for d.If d=1, then t=1+19=20 is the least common multiple of the two numbers we are looking for, and the numbers are relatively prime, so their least common multiple is their product. The factorizations of 20 into two relatively prime factors (ignoring the order of the factors) are 1 cdot 20 and 4 cdot 5, so 1,20 and 4,5 are two suitable pairs of numbers.If d=19, then t=38, so the two numbers are multiples of 19 and divisors of 38, hence 19 or 38. The two numbers cannot be equal, because then t-d=0 would be, but the pair 19, 38 satisfies the conditions of the problem. - Thus, three pairs of positive integers satisfy the requirements of the problem.If we also consider negative integers, then the pairs of numbers that meet the conditions are those that arise from the above by changing the sign of one or both numbers, since a number and its negative have the same multiples and divisors. Thus, the least common multiple and greatest common divisor of two numbers are the same as those of the absolute values of the two numbers.Note. Many contestants only wrote down one or two solutions, or all three, but without any justification. In addition to these, the problem could have had any number of other solutions. It was the essential mathematical idea that the realization that the above three pairs of numbers give all the solutions was required."},{"problem":"4.

Here, (a_{i,j} = 1) if the person in the ((i,j))-th seat raises a blue sign, and (a_{i,j} = 0) if they raise a yellow sign.2. Parity Condition:   We need each row and each column to have an odd number of 1s (blue signs). This means the sum of the entries in each row and each column must be odd.3. Submatrix Analysis:   Consider the (20 times 20) submatrix formed by the first 20 rows and the first 20 columns. We can freely assign 0s and 1s to these (20 times 20 = 400) entries.4. Determining the Last Row and Column:   The entries in the last row and the last column (highlighted in red) are determined by the parity conditions. Specifically:   - For each of the first 20 rows, the sum of the entries must be odd. If the sum of the first 20 entries in a row is even, the 21st entry in that row must be 1. If the sum is odd, the 21st entry must be 0.   - Similarly, for each of the first 20 columns, the sum of the entries must be odd. If the sum of the first 20 entries in a column is even, the 21st entry in that column must be 1. If the sum is odd, the 21st entry must be 0.5. Ensuring the Last Entry:   The entry at the intersection of the 21st row and the 21st column (i.e., (a_{21,21})) must be chosen to ensure that both the 21st row and the 21st column have an odd sum. This is always possible because the sum of the first 20 entries in the 21st row and the 21st column will determine the value of (a_{21,21}).6. Counting the Configurations:   Since we can freely assign 0s and 1s to the (20 times 20) submatrix, there are (2^{20 times 20} = 2^{400}) ways to do this. Each configuration of the (20 times 20) submatrix uniquely determines the values of the remaining entries to satisfy the parity conditions.Thus, the number of ways for each person to raise one sign so that each row and column has an odd number of people raising a blue sign is (2^{400}).The final answer is (boxed{2^{400}})."},{"problem":"Exercise 2.

We will first show that ( A E E' B ) is a rectangle. Since triangle ( B E F ) is isosceles at ( E ), ( E' ) is also the foot of the altitude from ( E ). Therefore, ((E E') parallel (A B)). Moreover, ((A E) parallel (B E')) because the opposite sides of a square are parallel. The quadrilateral ( A E E' B ) has its opposite sides parallel, so it is a parallelogram. Since ((A E) perp (A B)), we know that a parallelogram with a right angle is a rectangle. Therefore, ( A E E' B ) is a rectangle. In particular, since the opposite sides of a rectangle are equal, we have ( A E = B E' ).If we denote ( F' ) as the midpoint of the segment ([E D]), we can show in the same way that ((F F') parallel (A B)), and that ( E F' F E' ) and ( F' D C F ) are rectangles, and finally that ( E F' = E' F ) and ( F' D = F C ).Now, since ( E' ) is the midpoint of ([B F]), we have ( B E' = E' F ), and since ( F' ) is the midpoint of ([E D]), we have ( E F' = F' D ). Therefore, ( B E = E' F = F C ). Let ( a ) be the length of the side of the square. We deduce that the widths of the rectangles ( A E E' B ), ( E F' F E ), and ( F' D C F ) are all of length (frac{a}{3}).Applying the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle ( A E B ):[1 = mathrm{BE}^2 = A E^2 + mathrm{AB}^2 = a^2 + frac{a^2}{9} = frac{10}{9} a^2]Thus, ( a^2 = frac{9}{10} ).

Therefore, the set mathrm{B} has at most three elements, and mathrm{A} cup mathrm{B} cannot have more than five elements.This number is achieved precisely when mathrm{A}={a, b}, mathrm{B}={k, l, m}, where a < b and l / k = m / l = a, m / k = b.

Denote the area of this polygon by A_n. Compute prod_{i=2}^{infty}frac{A_i}{A_{i+1}}","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We are given a regular polygon with (2^n) sides inscribed in a circle of radius 1. We need to compute the infinite product (prod_{i=2}^{infty}frac{A_i}{A_{i+1}}), where (A_n) denotes the area of the polygon with (2^n) sides.2. Area of a Regular Polygon:   The area (A_n) of a regular polygon with (2^n) sides inscribed in a circle of radius 1 can be computed using the formula:   [   A_n = frac{1}{2} cdot 2^n cdot sinleft(frac{2pi}{2^n}right)   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   A_n = 2^{n-1} sinleft(frac{2pi}{2^n}right)   ]3. Telescoping Product:   We need to compute the product (prod_{i=2}^{infty}frac{A_i}{A_{i+1}}). Using the formula for (A_n), we have:   [   frac{A_i}{A_{i+1}} = frac{2^{i-1} sinleft(frac{2pi}{2^i}right)}{2^i sinleft(frac{2pi}{2^{i+1}}right)} = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{sinleft(frac{2pi}{2^i}right)}{sinleft(frac{2pi}{2^{i+1}}right)}   ]4. Simplifying the Product:   The product then becomes:   [   prod_{i=2}^{infty} frac{A_i}{A_{i+1}} = prod_{i=2}^{infty} left( frac{1}{2} cdot frac{sinleft(frac{2pi}{2^i}right)}{sinleft(frac{2pi}{2^{i+1}}right)} right)   ]   Notice that this product telescopes. Specifically, the (sinleft(frac{2pi}{2^{i+1}}right)) term in the denominator of one fraction will cancel with the (sinleft(frac{2pi}{2^i}right)) term in the numerator of the next fraction.5. Telescoping Effect:   After cancellation, we are left with:   [   prod_{i=2}^{infty} frac{A_i}{A_{i+1}} = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{1}{2} cdot frac{1}{2} cdots = frac{1}{2^{infty}} = 0   ]   However, this is incorrect because we need to consider the initial terms more carefully.6. Correct Telescoping:   The correct telescoping product should be:   [   prod_{i=2}^{infty} frac{A_i}{A_{i+1}} = frac{A_2}{A_{infty}}   ]   where (A_{infty}) is the area of the circle, which is (pi).7. Initial Area Calculation:   For (n=2), the polygon is a square, so:   [   A_2 = 2^{2-1} sinleft(frac{2pi}{2^2}right) = 2 sinleft(frac{pi}{2}right) = 2   ]8. Final Product:   Therefore, the product is:   [   prod_{i=2}^{infty} frac{A_i}{A_{i+1}} = frac{A_2}{A_{infty}} = frac{2}{pi}   ]The final answer is (boxed{frac{2}{pi}})"},{"problem":"6.

Respectively these must be 6 as a multiple of 3 and a factor of 240,3 as the only multiple of 3 which is prime and 9 as the only multiple of 3 less than 10 which is square.Finally we consider the column (or row) labelled odd. It must contain a factor of 240 , a prime and a square. Respectively these must be 5 as an odd factor of 240,7 as the only remaining odd prime and 1 as the only remaining odd square.Therefore once the descriptors have been placed into the grid, there is only one way to place the numbers into the grid.In conclusion, there are 72 ways to complete the grid."},{"problem":"Problem 6.2.

If we denote the sum of the visible denominations as x, then the sum of the denominations of the flipped coins will be 3x, meaning the total amount of money on the table is 4x, which is divisible by 4. Since both denominations are present, the total amount on the table can range from 31 to 67 rubles. The minimum amount is obtained by taking 1 coin of 5 rubles and 13 coins of 2 rubles: 5 + 2 cdot 13 = 31, and the maximum amount is obtained by taking 13 coins of 5 rubles and 1 coin of 2 rubles: 2 + 13 cdot 5 = 67.

After flipping, the total is 39 rubles.An example for 64 rubles does not exist, as the coins must be divided into groups with sums of 16 and 48, which is impossible with 14 coins. We will demonstrate this. Consider how to get 16 rubles. We must take an even number of 5-ruble coins, otherwise, we would need to make an odd sum with 2-ruble coins, which is impossible. Therefore, only two cases are possible:1) Take 2 coins of 5 rubles and 3 coins of 2 rubles, then we have 9 coins left, which give a sum of 45 rubles < 48 rubles.2) Take 8 coins of 2 rubles, then we have 6 coins left, with which we can get a sum of no more than 30 rubles < 48 rubles.Note.

This problem examines the solution of equations containing absolute values, noting that it is necessary to use the idea of case discussion in this problem. When the algebraic expression inside the absolute value is positive, the absolute value can be directly removed. When the algebraic expression inside is negative, it should be converted to its opposite number.

Odd Function Property: For an odd function, f(-x) = -f(x) for all x. Since f(x) is odd, we have f(0) = 0 because f(-0) = -f(0) implies 0 = -0.2. Symmetry About x=1: The symmetry about x=1 means that for any x, f(2-x) = f(x). This is because if you take a point (x, f(x)) and reflect it about the line x=1, it lands on (2-x, f(x)). 3.

The distance from the point P_2 on the hypotenuse A_2B to the point C' is the diagonal of the rectangle, which is clearly minimized when C'P_2 perp A_2B.The construction process is as follows: Construct the point C' on the side BC such that BC' = m_b (Figure 2). Draw a perpendicular from the point C' to the side BC' and measure the distance C'A_2 = m_a (Figure 3). Draw a perpendicular from C' to the hypotenuse A_2B, and let its foot be P_2.
