Thanks for asking from HCM.I can understand your concern. You have already read about scalp swellings. As you have found that, this swelling is tender on pressing, firm, mobile on bone and present on right lower part occipital bone, most probably it could be a cyst like swelling in scalp layer.Mostly these cysts are benign (non-dangerous). Most common swellings are sebaceous cyst, dermoid cyst, reactive lymph node. It can only be confirmed by biopsy or fine needle aspiration (FNAC). You can differentiate between these swellings to some extent. Like in case of sebaceous cyst, if it is carefully observed, a dark spot (punctum) can be seen over it. It is painless, but may be tender on pressing. Treatment is complete surgical excision of swelling with capsule. Mostly it is down under local anaesthesia if patient is co-operative.Dermoid cyst is similar to sebaceous cyst, but without punctum. If swelling is moved to one side, bony defect below it can be felt. Treatment is similar to dermoid cyst.Reactive lymph node is usually associated with some scalp disease like dandruff, skin infection, may be TB if you are from tropical country.

It missed the artery, the bones, and most of the tendons. The doctor removed the parts of the bullet that was at the skin on the outside of the leg and left the small bits of shrapnel inside the leg. The wound has healed quickly and cleanly. The bullet seems to have hit or at least damaged the tibial plantar nerve. I am experiencing an interesting assortment of sensations in my foot. The area forward of the instep on the bottom of the foot has no feeling to touch but fizzes, bubbles, burns, tingles, stabs, and electric shocks causing me no shortage of miserable hours. It is generally worse evenings and unbearable at bedtime. My big toe and the one next to it are bending to the right and bend downward if I lift my toes toward my shins. My first question is: If the nerve is severed why am I having all these sensations in my foot? If it s not severed is it likely to heal and give me the feeling back in my foot? Can nerve damage cause my toes to bend and twist or does it sound like some other hidden damage. Even though I have no feeling in the foot, I m walking, with some difficulty, since I do have to earn a living. Will walking on it benefit circulation or is it detrimental? Thanks for allowing me to pile on the questions. M","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for asking from HCM.I can understand your concern. As bullet injury occurred from inside out, it might have caused medial plantar nerve injury or tibial nerve injury just before bifurcation. It can only be confirmed by examination of your foot. Medial plantar nerve damage cause sensory loss or tingling/burning sensation on medial plantar area between big toe and adjacent toe. There will be weakness of big toe and adjacent toe plantar flexion. In your case, most symptoms are resembling medial plantar nerve damage. Now coming to your queries. 1. Severance or disconnection of nerve can be complete or partial. Partial disconnection can cause abnormal connection between nerve ends (neuroma).This can cause irritative symptoms like burning/tingling/insect crawling like sensations. Complete disconnection leads to loss of all sensations in affected region. Confirmation of it can be made by NCV/EMG studies.2. It is right that partial injury has more chances of healing than complete injury. Presence of some sensation is considered a good sign. Nerve regeneration and healing in such cases can occur unto 18 months, but maximum healing occurs in first 12 months. Even surgical repair of nerve shows some good results in first 12 months.But there is one problem. If irritative symptoms are severe and not decreasing even after medication, sometimes nerve is severed by doctor to relieve discomfort.   3. Walking or physical activity has nothing to do with healing of nerve. But it helps in stretching of muscles and acts like physiotherapy, which is good for muscles supplied by the nerve. You can passively stretch your toes up and down. It also prevents permanent spasm or contracture of joints and thus deformity. Do not overdo it. It can damage muscle.Some tips-Do not take any medications for healing of nerves as after 1 year of injury, drugs do not enhance healing. -Your are having small sized peripheral nerve injury. Repair of such type nerve is very difficult and results are not very promising.-You can take help of physiotherapist to learn about toe exercise.Thanks. Hope it will help you.

Thanks for asking from HCM.I can understand your concern. There are mainly four manure gases which cause tissue damage - Hydrogen Sulfide, Ammonia, Carbon Monoxide, Methane. They cause mainly irritation of breathing apparatus e.g. nose, oral cavity, larynx, trachea and lungs. This is followed by poor oxygen intake and ultimately hypoxia and asphyxia. Poor oxygen amount in blood leads to damage of brain, heart and rest organs. Direct damage of brain and heart occurs at high concentration of these gases which is usually fatal.Now in case of your husband, damage of heart and brain can only be predicted after evaluating his signs and symptoms. If he is conscious, oriented, following simple commands, able to answer simple \\"yes-no\\" questions, able to remember important date/address/name of family members, able to move his all limbs and do his routine activities, then his brain damage is minimal to mild. If he is totally dependent upon you, not able to converse, having repeated fits, bed-ridden, making no purposeful movements like approaching glass of water etc, then he is having serious brain damage. Similarly heart damage can be mild like no shortness of breath, no chest pains, dyspnea occurs only after exertion, no dependent part swelling like in feet or severe like dyspnea even on lying down, palpitations with chest pain, dependent part swelling. It can only be evaluated after through clinical examination.The neurologist will evaluate him and may advise some tests like MRI of brain and EEG. MRI of brain helps in finding areas of brain damage which further predicts probability of fits, weakness, behavioural and personality changes. EEG will mainly find out chances of fits.After confirmation, he may be prescribed medications for fits (if present) like phenytoin or valproate, some nerve specific vitamins like B12, folic acid, pyridoxine, some nerve regenerator medications like citicoline. Besides all this, you can help him by giving full mental support, helping him in doing active physiotherapy like stretching of limbs and exercise, giving him puzzle questions to enhance his abstract thinking, ask him to play chess or Sudoku to sharpen his thinking, provide him diary to remember things to do daily. All this will be needed if he is having serious brain damage. In mild damage, he will recover completely with time.Thanks. Hope it will help you.

You won't have the desired effect though. Also skipping it doesn't mean you won't have side effects after the other two dosages (if you have any side effects at all).

Thanks for your question at HCM . New lump needs to be seen by a doctor. If this lump is something you have noticed now only , it is best that you see a doctor and get it examined. Tail bone pain responds best to offloading the pressure over it.Sitting cushion which is usually an horse show shaped or a doughnut shaped inflatable balloon cushion helps to offload pressure on tail bone. I suggest you to use it religiously irrespective of where you are sitting over at least 6 weeks to get any meanigful benefit from it. Also it is advisable to avoid sleeping directly over your back. Sleeping on the sides for a few weeks can help. Relieving the pressure over the tail bone is the most important step in relieving your pain. You can use any pain killer over initial few days. The lump is mostly the tip of tail bone . Hope this helps. All the best Regards."},{"Patient":"I am a 70 year old woman who had a synovial cyst of the spine about 5 years ago.

Recently, a similar pain has begun in the same area as when I experienced the synovial cyst. Is it possible that a cyst could reoccur in the same location?","Doctor":"Hi there. Thanks for your question at HCM. Synovium is the normal covering of joints which help in production of joint fuild and smooth functioning of joints.Synovial cysts are fluid filled lesions, arising from synvium of joints which have worn out. Age related arthritis in joints of at th eback of your spine ( facet joints) can lead to synovial cysts whcih can manifest with pain in the lower limbs( since these joints are pretty close to your nerves in the spine. As long as the joints are still present ( that is no fusion or fixation surergy done for these joints) these cyusts can persist and can recurr. So the answer for your question is , yes it is possible for it to reccur in same location, if that particular joint was not fused last time around. If the pain is bothering you , the best way to confirm this would be a repaet MRI of your spine. It os best that you see your doctor and confirm that your current symptoms are matching the findings of spinal involvement and get fuirther evaluated. Hope this helps. All the best . Regards.

One week later, she began to uncontrollably shake primarily in her right arm and hand and somewhat in her left arm and hand. Could this be from inflammation from the surgery; a pinched nerve from not sleeping correctly? We are scheduled to see a Board-Certified Neurologist on Monday. We are just scared. There is no pain involved, just involuntary shaking, and the shaking stops when she lies down at a 40-45 degree angly.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for asking from HCM.I can understand your concern. Based on your wife's surgical detail, most probably she might had disc compression at C4-5 and C5-6 along with cord compression. I could not make out whether surgery was done via front aspect or back of neck. You can provide more details in another question. Any way, if there was compression of cord which got relieved after surgery, she had shown some improvement. Now that she had again deteriorated after one week of surgery, it might be due to the edema of surrounding tissue, failure of fusion construct, late bleeding and blood clot, granulation tissue after inflammation or disc at another level causing compression of cord. These shakes are most probably due to hypertonia of muscles, less chances are of tremors. It can be confirmed by clinical examination and MRI of cervical spine. Exact pathology and cause will be confirmed after it and based on it, further plan of management like surgical decompression of spine or medicines like baclofen to relieve tone  will be decided. You need to consult neurologist. He will examine your wife and advise MRI. Meanwhile, your wife should avoid neck movement as much as possible, use cervical collar if you have it at home, avoid neck pillow, any kind of weight lifting, avoid any kind of jerky movements, check for sensations of all extremities for any loss.

In case of disc disease, surgery or conservative treatment decision is made based upon multiple factors. MRI findings are correlated with clinical profile of patient, patient's dedication to follow precautions before and after surgery, physiotherapy .Now in your case, I will give you some knowledge and insight of disc disease. Based on that you may be benefited regarding management of your disc problem.As you have disc bulge at three level, it might be due to your age ( if it is more than 60 years, chances of disc bulge is unto 35-40%), your occupation (heavy weight lifting or keeping spine in flexed position for long duration). Now if you are less than 60 years, active, having no other illness, then you should consult doctor and get your neurological examination done. The doctor will examine your pain site, any radiation of pain from back to posterior part of lower limb. It is due to nerve compression from disc. Doctor will evaluate your urine, bowel and sexual function for any deficit. He/she will examine you for sensory loss in L4/L5/S1 territory which is your front aspect of leg and plantar aspect of your foot. After that, your lower limb power will be checked. If there is any deficit, then it will be correlated with MRI findings. It is known as Clincio-radiological correlation. Based on it, you will be advised pain killers like pregabaline/gabapentine, nerve vitamins like B12, folic acid and/or surgery. If you are >60 years, bed-ridden, having morbid illness like heart disease and not active, then you will be advised medical management most probably.Usually, disc surgery is advised in case of focal deficit caused by nerve compression from disc, acute disc with focal deficit, no relief in radicular pain even after full dose of pain killers after 6 weeks of therapy, disc herniation with unstable spine and patient is fit to undergo surgery and follow post operative advise.You are having diffuse disc bulge at L3-4, L4-5 and L5-S1 which is usually not treated by surgery. Mostly, disc extrusion or migration are managed by surgery. But final decision can only be made after complete clinical evaluation. Mean while, you should avoid weight lifting, avoid forward flexion, travelling long distance, prolonged sitting. Thanks. Hope it will help you.

I continue be on diet with only fruits, vegetables and curd for almost six months without the consulting the doctor. Later in Dec 2012, I started feeling burning sensation in my right thigh and pain in my right foot in sitting posture.

Why do I now have a right posterior lateral disc herniation with the appearance of an extruded fragment postereolaterally on the right at L5-S1 and a mild buldge at L1-2?","Doctor":"Hi there Thanks for your question at HCMDisc herniation is one step in the natural history of disc degeneration. Once some part of the spine is fused , the segments adjacent to the fused part of spine , is subjected to more stress , as the movements at the segment are increased and hence undergoes earlier degeneration. This is known as adjacent segment degeneration, which can present as disc herniation. Long segment fusion, which can be said as more than 2 levels fusion(as in your scenario) is more commonly associated with such degeneration.Such a degeneration is also more likely to happen , if you are more than 60 years old and there were signs of some degeneration in these discs prior to the fusion surgeryHope this answers your question.All the best Regards,"},{"Patient":"Sir my mother rescently had a minor nerve injury in brain and a minute clot doctor prescribed to take eption tablets dailt twice for one year.Is it safe to take them ?

My question is: Is there anything else I could be doing about the foggy brain, because he slows down my thinking process?","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!I understand your concern and would explain that your symptoms may be related to the raised sinus pressure from the nasal obstruction. The fact that your headache is relieved by Exedrin and sudafed is another argument in favor of this cause. From the other hand, antihistamines can cause these symptoms (slow thinking and sleepiness) as a common adverse effect. Do you have these symptoms when you don't use antihistamines? What type of antihistamines are you taking? I recommend you to consult with your allergologist and try to find another therapy for hay fever (immunotherapy or a non sedating histamine).Caffeine (in the coffee) could also be helpful if you tolerate it well.

You should know that it is needed a long time (months up to a year), to recover from such a disorder. After the first year, the possibility of improvement is too low, and the situation remains the same. This is because during the first months, the blood is being absorbed and the there is inflammation in the surrounding tissues. But after this long period, the deficits which remain are caused by the damaged brain cells, which do not regenerate. The situation, complicated with pneumonia and ulcer bleeds is really concerning and needs a careful treatment in specialized medical centers. They could be related to aspiration and the therapies she has been taking.  Hope to have been helpful!Best regards, Dr. Aida"},{"Patient":"I have had a stroke.

Medically , you have had a TIA which in colloquial terms means a stroke which recovered within 24 hours.

The symptoms of tripping and memory loss can be symptoms in numerous neurological disorders.  Impossible to narrow anything down just on that information.  If your neurologist didn't mention anything about the MRI and said that all you are diagnosed with is FIBROMYALGIA then, that suggests to me that your MRI is likely without significant findings.

Your symptoms seem to be related to mononeuritis multiplex, which is an asymmetrical type of neuropathy, related to your thyroid dysfunction. Hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormones) can lead to fluid retention and pressure surrounding nerve tissues. So your symptoms can indicate a low dose of thyroid hormones intake (you need to take more).

If the symptoms do not improve first it must be stabilized whether they are  mostly related to the pinched nerve or spinal stenosis. Judging by your description the pinched nerve is the most likely culprit. In that case the next step are local injections with corticosteroids and analgesics under imaging guidance. If that doesn't work either the last resort is surgery to relieve nerve compression I am afraid.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"Hi I am having sharp pains in my lower stomach and have been experiencing pins and needles in my feet,  I do not know it these are connected.  I have had a section in which I had complications in my womb was torn - I have recently has surgery to removed adhesions but am still experiencing pain.  Can you please advise me what to do?  Many thanks","Doctor":"Hi.Pain in lower abdomen and pins and needles feeling in feet may not be related directly. They can occur due to deficiency caused by intestinal obstructions and can be treated well with proper supplements in therapeutic doses as advised by your Doctor and/or dietitian. IF you still experience pain in abdomen, better to go for investigations to see the position of adhesions. The best one is ''enteroclysis'' in which a small tube is passed into the duodenum and barium passed through in 'real-time'' fluoroscopic control to see the motility , dilatation , obstruction , stricture and so on.If this is normal , may be you have to undergo further tests as per Gastro Surgeon. Till then be on liquid diet, avoid foods and beverages which enhance pain ."},{"Patient":"hello, i am referring to my husband 58 yo black male, fell and brokw his right hip over month ago, now i am facing a confused male i over saw the words chronic microvascular ischemic disease, so i was wondering would this have anything to do with his confusion (he also has been diagnosed with","Doctor":"I read your question carefully but you must know that something must have gone wrong because the question seems to be unfinished. You start to say\\"he' also has been diagnosed with\\" and then the sentence is interrupted. Anyway you can submit the full question again later.As for chronic microvascular ischemic changes confusion is not a common presenting sign, however it depends on the extent of these lesions. If they are only mild then they are not the case, but if they are extended they may lead to dementia and confusion. So the imaging report should be read carefully on that regard. As for treating it, that depends on the cause, the causes can be many. Most common ones are damage to blood vessels from high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol and those issues should be addressed.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"I wake up at nights with numbness along with burning pain in my right hand..

A nerve in the back of the neck is also a possibility, but usually there is some neck pain as well. Anyway the two conditions can easily be differentiated through nerve conduction studies and neck MRI (if distribution and conduction studies indicate carpal tunnel MRI may not be necessary). Neither is a condition to be alarmed, in the sense of life threatening, but you should be checked.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"My question is my father is suffering from paralysis from last year to still now, paralysis is one side.

You should have real expectations towards doctors. If the reason for the paralysis is a stroke (confirmed with brain imaging), then you should realize that a part of his brain has suffered irreversible damage, some brain cells are dead and there is no treatment to turn them back to life.

In 80% of the patients the sciatica pain does subside gradualy over the course of the weeks. It may be recurring though, that is a possibility if there are chronic changes on your spine which with aging are not likely to disappear.If the pain has not subsided for 6 weeks though imaging evaluation is needed to see the degree and site of nerve compression.

They said it was vertigo, is it possible I had a stroke. My speech was fine. Never been so terrified! Need reassurance!!","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern.Vertigo is a symptom, unfortunately it doesn't say much about what the doctors thought to have been the cause. It would also have been useful to know some more details about your age, weight, lifestyle, prior medical history, family medical history to evaluate the likelihood of it being a stroke.Whether I can exclude with certainty for it to have been a transient ischemic attack, a subtype of stroke....no I can not do it with certainty. But I can say that if you are a young person, without any other medical condition, a stroke is little likely to be the cause of your vertigo episode, other causes such as inner ear issues are much more probable.Wishing you good health"},{"Patient":"Hi there.

Can you please help me if this can be the cause and how to get rid of it... Thanks...","Doctor":"Hi there. Thanks for your question at HCM . Straightening of lumbar spine( as seen in your x-ray) indcates spasm of the muscles around your spine. The muscles of our back go into spasm after any painful stimulus( the stimulus can be sprained muscle or a pinched nerve or slip disc). This spasm of the muscle around  the spine is responsible for straightening of spine. So it is the effect of the pain and not the cause of pain.X ray is an investigation for the bony structure of your spine. It does not give an y information about a pinched nerve or a slip disc. MRI will give a better idea about the source of your pain. If you have numbness in your legs and you have completed 6 weeks of treatment with medicines and physiotherapy, it would be prudent to rule out the cause of pain by getting an MRI of your lumbar(lower) spine.Hope this helps.

The treatment options for spinal cord injury with neruo deficit are still evolving. Post spinal cord trauma any meaningful recovery in neurogical condition happens during the first 6 months. The expected recovery afte the intial 6 months is almost 0. This is attributable to irreversible changes( as of now) happening in the cord architecture, which includes atrophy , thinnig of nerve structures( myelomalacia)associated with fluid filled cavity formation(syrinx).Once these have set in , further recovery is improbable.If you have power in your leg and only sensory loss, it is still manageable as you can maintain mobility and function independently. PT, strengthening exercises canhhelp function better. Also spinal trauma is one of the commonly missed trauma cases in the ER.The levoacoliosis in your lower back , should not be a matter of concern if the pain in lower back is negligible or manageable.

Regarding your concern, your symptoms seem to be related to a worsening of your situation ( which may be a higher grade of herniated disc, or a stenosis of the spinal canal, compressing both the nerve radix and the spine).

Please let me know. My email is YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hi there. Thanks for your question at HCM Your concern about the MRI findings are appreciable. The advances in spine have made modern day spine care more safe and successful than ever before. It can definitely be treated. There are few things you can do from your side to protect your spine : 1. Not to life heavy weights. 2. Avoid squatting or any activity which would require you to sit on the floor. 3. Avoid bending forwards. 4.Avoid twisting movements of your back. With these precautions and added back strengthening exercises , you can help your back recover. However, you might need additional treatment like injection shots or surgery if your pain has been non responsive over more than 2 months, with radiation to legs associated with numbness or tingling. Your intensity of pain and the disability associated with back pain are as important as your MRI findings in guiding the course of action. Hope this helps. All the best.

A few weeks ago my hair started falling out and I have been experiencing malaise and fatigue. Could there be any connection? (I just had blood work and my thyroid came back normal)","Doctor":"Hi there, thank for your question. Hair fall has no one to one co relation with degenerative spinal disease. I suggest you to meet a dermatologist for your hair fall and be rest assured that it has nothing to do with your spinal pain. Though both are age related, they are independent of each other. On the other hand fatigue can be associated with pinched nerves in cervical and lumbar canal stenosis.Hope this answers your question. All the best. Regards.

I have mild pain between shoulder and elbow and there is swelling my arm fingers with mild pain. I do walking and gym everyday for about an hour. I am also practicing isometric exercises twice a day. My question is what type of exercises I should avoid and how to cure the swelling in fingers without any medication.","Doctor":"Hi there, Thanks for your question at HCM.The spinal nerves in our neck are wired in such a way that pressure at particular point can cause pain distributed in an area away from the spine, as in shoulder and arms in your situation.It is possible to have shoulder pain if the 5 th and 6 th nerves are pinched in the spine.Isometric exercises, gym and walking definitely help. You should avoid exercise which involve twisting and rotation of your neck.Swelling of fingers can be relived by elevation, passive and active exercises at all joints, if it is not due to infection or severe inflammation. Hope this answers your questionsAll the best. Regards. Dr.SBK"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have some kind spinal disorder from birth. It may be spinal cord kyphosis.

Even we consult to many doctors but advice not to go for any kind of surgery. I am now 25 living normal life no pain nothing. But my appearance from back side is the issue. Any advices.","Doctor":"Hi there, thanks for your question. At your age cosmetic appearance is one of the indication for intervention apart from disability caused by pain. In spite of recent advances in modern spine surgery kyphosis correction surgeries definitely have higher risk than correction of deformity like scoliosis. So if you can manage with your cosmetic appearance and pain is negligible you can wait. In the other hand if you feel the appearance is disabling and you would rather get it corrected, surgery is advisable. Your doctors might have refused surgery due to smaller magnitude of deformity. Treatment varies on case by case basis. Hope this helps. All the best.Regards.. Dr.SBK"},{"Patient":"my daughter s contrast MRI showed she had a Slap Tear .

Artifacts are quite commin in muskuloskeletal MRIs.It is possible that shadow of some other soft tiaaye overlapping on the native structure of labrum in shoulder, giving the appearance of a tear. Also MRI is an observer depedenet investigation. Interpretation can change based on who is reading the films. The best and confirmatory test would be to see the tear during surgery. Hope this helps.

Mild grade 1 anterolisthesis of C3 on C4 and mild grade 1 retrolisthesis of C5 on C6. Do you think this would call for surgery?","Doctor":"Hi there, thanks for your question at HCM. Cervical spine related problems are usually more manageable than lumbar spine issues. If your pain is manageable and not disturbing your daily routine. I think you can wait. I suggest you to try physiotherapy, isometric cervical exercises, pain medications in a step wise fashion. Injection shots also can give considerable relief. In the spine pain ladder there are a lot of steps to be taken before you land at the step of surgery. Surgery should be the last resort. Your MRI findings look manageable.

The best solution for pain aggravated by any activity is to avoid the activity. In your case since bending forward ia bringing on the pain, avoiding bending and twisting,squating kind of movements will certainly help. However if u start having pain in more routine activities of daily living ,it is better to get evaluated to see whether the process of fusion is complete.

It is almost a colic pain that will intensify and when the pain is at it s worse it is comparable to labor pains. I have been to 3 different doctors and have had almost every gastro test done: endoscope, colonoscopy, ct scan and a gastro emptying which they all came back clear as did all my blood work.

A good dehydration and a lot of rest is necessary for her during these days. If you notice that her symptoms (confusion, sleepiness, headache, dizziness, slurred speach) are worsening in stead of getting better, or other symptoms like limb numbness occur, I recommend bringing her to ER for a physical examination and a brain CT scan to exclude possible delayed intracranial hemorrhage, which can occur even months after a head trauma.Hope to have been of help!Best wishes, Dr. Aida"},{"Patient":"I just turned 80, have not had any significant health problems.

All the major blood tests, 2 MRIs, CT Scan, colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, nerve conduction, physical therapy and steroid injections have not resulted in a diagnosis. The only finding is a slight nerve conduction deficit in my right thigh. So no definitive diagnosis. I now take Cymbalta, Narcos & Lorazapam. I took Gabapentin and Lyrica which did not help and the Narco s are starting to not help much. The Cymbalta, however, has improved my depression. I have been offered surgery to remove my coccyx but am told that results are 5050 and there is a very long recovery period and high risk of infection.

Use this cushion in all situations , whenever u have to sit. while sleeping it is better to sleep on sides , rather on your back. Since you have tried all options anasthetic injections or surgery done by an expert might help.

We really did not get a true diagnosis because hardly any test, and the CAT scan and the CT scan, other than blood","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I am sorry about the situation you are in.It is difficult to make recommendations on treatment though because I am not sure she has Alzheimer's. Dementia can have many different causes, Alzheimer's is the most common, but there are other possibilities to be excluded such as vascular dementia (repeated strokes), vitamin B12 deficiency, low thyroid function, Parkinson's disease just to name some common ones.The fact she manifested symptoms at only 56 is a red flag to consider a diagnosis other than Alzheimer's as it typically occurs later. The tremor you describe is also not typical for Parkinson, makes stroke, parkinsonian syndromes or vitamin b12 deficiency more likely.So the way to go is to check what blood tests has she exactly done, have thyroid function and vitamin B12 level been included. Also while a CT might serve to exclude some issues, generally a MRI is a recommended exam as it gives more info on the atrophied sites or old lesions which could orient the diagnosis. A neurological exam also is needed although I understand the difficulties you are encountering in finding a neurologist, she should be evaluated for parkinsonian or other neurological signs as well as have some neuropsychological tests to determine what areas of cognition have been more affected.I hope things work out for the best."},{"Patient":"Hi my name is jim.

Since then I ve been getting headaches and the sweats. What could this be.","Doctor":"Hello Jim!Thank you for asking on HCM!I understand your concern and would like to explain that the most common cause of nose bleeding associated with headache is uncontrolled high blood pressure. Have you measured your blood pressure during this episode?The sweating may be related to an autonomic reaction to a high intensity headache. But I recommend consulting with your GP for a careful physical examination and some lab tests like : complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, fasting glucose, kidney and liver function tests, coagulation tests and blood electrolytes to exclude possible causes of headache and nose bleeding. It is necessary to closely monitor your blood pressure during these days and especially during the episodes of headaches.

I would like to explain that both topamax and lamotrigine are antiepileptic drugs, usually used for the treatment of seizures and migraine prevention. But they have also another effect, which is mood stabilizer. Lamotrigine is more famous for this effect than topamax. Other antiepileptics very effective in your medical condition are carbamazepine and valproate, although they have more side effects than topiramate and lamotrigine. Regarding ciprolex, it is an antidepressant, helpful in treating negative signs of bipolar disorder (depression, lack of hope, etc). If your condition has not got better with this therapy, I would recommend consulting with your psychiatrist to consider the possibility to switch into another antiepileptic (like valproate or carbamazepine), or start Lithium therapy, which is very effective in bipolar disorder if no contraindications and well tolerated.

Your symptoms may be related to partial epilepsy seizures or a conversion disorder. I recommend consulting with the neurologist for a careful physical examination and an EEG. If suspicions are raised, a brain CT scan or MRI may be needed to exclude an intracranial lesion ( tumor, vascular malformation, etc) of your symptomatology. Further lab tests (complete blood count for anemia or infection, kidney and liver function tests, fasting glucose, thyroid hormone levels, blood electrolytes), should be performed to exclude possible metabolic causes that may mimic a similar clinical scenario.

It is not related to the spinal issues the explanation lies elsewhere as the brain areas and nerves responsible for the speech function are at a higher level than the spinal cord.So your friend has to have more tests for some other type of involvement, either a brain issue which should be revealed through a brain MRI, or a peripheral nerve issue which involves the cranial nerves, tests like lumbar puncture and nerve conduction studies with electromyography might be necessary to investigate that.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"hello my ex boyfriend socked me very very hard in the center of my forehead oct 16 it is now the 24th. i was dizzy could barley open my eyes i didnt go to the hospital until 2-3 days later. had a catscan and the dr. said on the left internal capsule of my brain their is something there, it could be nothing or possibly a tumor. low attenuation area in low left internal capsule of my brain.

Viz: nausea / vomiting/ abdominal distention / constipation or loose motions/ fever/ fainting or collapsing / sweating/ and so on.If these symptoms are not there , it is less probably due to pancreatitis. Large stomach hernia can cause this type of pain if the opening ( neck) is small and there is entrapment of intestines. If one goes for an X-ray in standing lateral position , one can see intestine being trapped. Such a simple test.

My questions are 1) the space that is where my brain is suppose to be, what is there now, it is an empty space or fluid there. 2) Besides a weakened side what other things could be affected by this.","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to Health Care Magic. I understand your concern.The condition you are describing, is called neuro encephalomalacia, which  is a condition characterized by localized softening of brain tissues due to inflammation or hemorrhage. The softening may occur in a specific part of the brain or may be more widespread.The treatment for this disease mainly consists of detecting the underlying cause behind the change in brain consistency and dealing with it properly. In extremely severe cases, damaged brain substance may be removed by surgery. However, the brain consistency undergoes a considerable change due to the removal of the softened brain material.-Regarding to your questions, the space that was previously occupied by brain mass, now it is filled with cerebrospinal fluid. Cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) is normally produced by your brain, and has three main functions: protects brain and spinal cord from trauma. CSF supplies nutrients to nervous system tissue and removes waste products from cerebral metabolism-As with any surgical procedure, complications may occur. Brain surgery risk is tied to the specific location in the brain that the operation will affect. For example, if the area of the brain that controls speech is operated on, then speech may be affected. I mean the side effects depend on the part of the brain which is resected.

It is a matter of concern  Dear , A bulging disc is not necessarily a sign that anything serious is happening to your spine and need surgery .On seeing an Exray ,  surgery can not be dagnosed And is not a guarantee  for better future life , and will enable you to play Bedminton.If your doctor insists surgery, I would suggest you to  consult other  specialist , for 2nd opinion .Disc bulges are a common cause of lower back pain. They can sometimes be reduced by doing simple exercises and stretches, and making some lifestyle modifications.Our day today derailed life style and faulty food habits cause our immune system to become weak and lead to various sufferings . Dispacement of disc or joints  is one of such  sufferings  . Balanced diet including all essential nutrients - vitamins , minerals  and antioxidants  in natural form  , fiber ,  fruit veges , Aloe Vera , lemon juice with black pepper & salt .  Turmeric  powder in a cup of hot milk at bed time and BF , regular walk , exercise ,deep breathing , meditation and yoga posture are very helpful in  eleminating inflammation and pains any where ,   and remove  your health problems .Backbends usually give relief to disc bulg. When done purposefully backbending poses increase the C curve of your lower back, and there by help in building strength  of your immune system .Ushtrasan on Vajjarasan & Certain poses, such as setu bandh &   (Bridge ), will help you to build strength in the lower back muscles, which in time may help correct your disc .

It s very tender. I have to rest often so I can carry on with my daily activities. I blink very often and my right eye lid stays open when I blink, therefore I have to lie down and close and rest my eyes. I use an eye cover for the night.

As for the choice SSRI (citalopram) are a good choice, but they have frequent effects on loss of sexual drive, so a tricyclic like Amitriptyline might be better in a young individual.It should be discussed with a psychiatrist though, especially in a 18 year old, because there is worry about potential increased suicide risk in use of these antidepressants before the age of 21.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"ive had 3 seizures in the last month after having got a little drunk in japan before that i hadnt drank for 4 years but before that i had a severe drinking problem and epilepsy, i was hoping that my epilepsy had stopped but i know i shouldnt have drank and i have stopped and will not continue ever again, what advice can you offer","Doctor":"Hello,Feel sorry for your condition but seems you got the solution.Let me explain; it is well known that there exist a wide group of trigger factors for epilepsy to happen.Main subject here are metabolic disorders which could be caused from excess of drinking alcohol,also high temperature,physical and mental stress...etcIt seems in your case that drinking means seizures, so STOP DRINKING.BUT an appointment with your doctor is recommended to determine epilepsy type, etiology so as to derermine treatment.Wish this helped and feel free for any other information."},{"Patient":"Hi My Dad 61 yrs old is had a back pain complains so after and MRI the result is L5/S1 DISC - posterial protrusion indenting the thecal sac and impinging on the traversing roots at the lateral recess; mild bony canal narrowing is present.

I am Dr Alok Sinha, MD Psychiatry from India. I have read your question carefully and understood it. I can understand your concern. I will try my best to answer your query.The condition you are mentioning here is called prolapse intervetebral disc with neuronal compromise. I will make you understand this disease. Our vertebral column is a bony structure which is made up of many bones called vertebrum. vertebral column is hollow towards posterior side to accommodate spinal cord. In between two vertebra there is a cartilagenous disc which is a main part of vertebral joint. Sometimes due to wear and tear or injury to vertebra, a intervertebral disc gets prolapsed and bulges posteriorly. If this prolapse is severe then this disc may impinge upon the spinal cord and emerging spinal nerves roots. This condition is dangerous as it may cause paralysis of lower portion of body. In your father's case it is more complicated due to multiple levels of involvement at both cervical (neck) and lumbar region. Sooner or later surgery may be required. I suggest you to follow the advise of his treating neurosurgeon who may advice correctly the right time of surgery according to functional capacity of your father. I wish your father a better health."},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor, My husband is suffering from brain stroke. His brain has clot in left side. so he cannot freely use his right hand, and right leg.

Now he is alright. now he take levox, zeptal cr 400 tablet in morning and evening, Clotnil A, nexito plus, Eritel 20mg etc. Is it helpful. How to stop the fit. Now he is get go tired Please give your advice thank you","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern.Seizures are a common complication of stroke, affecting about 5-10% of stroke patients. There are many antiepileptic drugs available which can be used to prevent further seizures. For the moment your doctors have already started such a drug which is Zeptal CR, one of the most used drugs for that purpose. So for now you should see how effective it will be in preventing your husband's seizures. You state he's alright now, so no reason to change. Only if he gets other seizures can some other treatment be considered (like valproic acid, lamotrigine, levetiracetam etc).

I also have ear ache in right ear. Went to ER on Friday had CT and bloodwork all normal pain is worse each day. Dizziness and some nausa too but no vomiting.","Doctor":"Hi.You pain is related to food. Pain is aggravated after eating - itself is a good clue to the diagnosis. The most probable reason can be an ulcer in the stomach or have colitis, or pancreatitis. CT and blood work are normal - it rues out pancreatitis . Better to ask for an upper GI endoscopy and colonoscopy. Ear pain may be due to another reason - locally due to impacted wax or acute otitis media."},{"Patient":"I was informed that: 1. Mild to moderate diffuse cerebral and cerebellar volume loss, somewhat greater than expected for the patient s age. 2. Small incidental curvilinear posterior pericallosal lipoma (benign tumor of fatty tissue) 3. Otherwise normal MRI of the brain. How serious is all this? I m very concerned.","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern.Everyone of us after our twenties starts to lose brain cells, hence brain volume, it's part of aging. With the passing of the years as the loss adds up it will start to become visible on MRI. So how abnormal that finding is depends on your age which unfortunately you do not mention.Judging by the report it would seem it is more than the average for someone your age. It says somewhat so it's not allarmingly more and it is a somewhat subjective estimation anyway.I don't know why you had the MRI, but that finding shouldn't be causing any symptoms. At worst it may indicate that your brain is aging quickly, might have a greater predisposition for cognitive decline in the future, but that isn't necessarily so, there isn't an exact correlation between brain mass and cognitive performance.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"My dad was just admitted to the E.R. He has had an intense throbbing pain in his neck and head. He went to a chiropractor about it 2 days ago without any luck. Today he went to get X-rays and they immediately rushed him into the E.R thinking that he has blocked arteries in his brain? What could be some other possibilities?","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern.If the imaging results like CT or MRI show that there is a blocked blood vessel then the diagnosis has been made, there is no reason to look for other possibilities. Now you should concentrate on what originated this blocked vessel. Looking at your description of pain in the neck and head, one possibility would be a cervical artery dissection, a rupture in the wall of a blood vessel, with accumulation of blood inside the wall which can lead to narrowing of the vessel lumen as well as formation of thrombi which can cause a stroke. Of course this possibility should be confirmed with imaging of neck vessels apart from the head.Other possibilities may be heart issues leading to formation of thrombi which enter the circulation, block a vessel and cause a stroke, or atherosclerosis of neck vessels which again can form thrombi which can lead to stroke.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"MRI reveals Severe degeneration at C3/4 & C5/6, together with significant T9/10 damage: hospitalised for 2 weeks iro pain management etc., However, I continue to experience some respiratory difficulty (it feels as though I cannot raise my diaphragm sufficiently on inspiration?). Pulmonary function results are not significant, although some limitations noted. Am wondering if this is likely due to some impingement on Phrenic Nerve as a consequence of cervical damage?","Doctor":"Degenerative changes at C3, C4, C5 can produce phrenic neve damage and you may develop breathing difficulty.  This produces reduced diaphragm movement also. If there is some ongoing compression,  you may require cervical spine decompression and fixation."},{"Patient":"Hi my brother in.

The cerebellar hemorrhage is also unlikely to cause rapid lots of vision in both eyes.  He needs to be investigated for other causes like ischemic optic neuropathy, optic neuritis, amaurosis fugax etc. Whether he will get his vision back depends on the cause and duration of vision loss."},{"Patient":"I don t know if u can im 32 yrs old and female and just found out last sat I have a avm on the left front part of my brain the size of a quarter I don t know what to do if I should do surgery or radiation or maybe leave it be or should I get a second look at my brain","Doctor":"If it is an unruptured one and not causing any fits,  it can be left alone since the chance of bleeding per year is around 4%.

I am Dr Alok Sinha, MD Psychiatry from India. I can understand your concern. I will try my best to answer your query.I have carefully read your question and could understand that you are suffering from osteo-arthritis and neuropathic pain.Firstly let me educate you about various available medicines for pain.Pain is a noxious stimulus which should be managed promptly. Now a days pain management is done through a multidisciplinary approach which includes physician, surgeon, anesthetist and psychiatrist. If pain is recurring  and simple pain killers like NSAIDS are ineffective then some alternatives should be tried. There are few medicines which act locally like pain relief gels and sprays. Some newer oral medicines act at spinal cord and brain level and reduce the perception of pain. Some medicines contain combination of a analgesic and an opioid. Some refractory cases required nerve block.Now coming to your case, since you are having chronic pain of osteo-arthritis and neuropathy, you need regular medicine. Common pain killer NSAIDs may be dangerous as they may cause peptic ulcer and renal complications. Opioid medication may be addicting. Hence you need something with little side effect.If a lady like you comes to my clinic, I suggest them to relax and try some De-stressing measures. Because stress and anxiety increases the perception of pain. These destressing activities are:--  healthy balance diet-  regular exercise, yoga, meditation & relaxation exercise-  adequate rest and sleep-  listening soothing slow relaxing music etc. If needed I prescribe them some medicines like Pregabalin and Nortriptyline in combination along with methylcobalamin and folic acid. These medicines act on spinal cord and brain pain pathways and are relatively safer for long term use. Results in clinical settings are rewarding. You may discuss these issues with your doctor. Hope I have given you a way. I wish you all the best."},{"Patient":"My dad aged 65 had an haemorrphage stroke three months and his whole right side of the body is paralyzed.

Hypertension is a main cause of bleed and results in haemorrhagic stroke. Re-bleed may recur if hypertension is poorly controlled. This has happened with your father. Because of recurrence of stroke he had suddenly developed motor and sensory weakness leading to heaviness feeling in right side of body. He is also having poor sleep which points more towards recent insult to brain (a fresh stroke).

I also recommend you to try relaxation techniques as yoga and do regular exercise, that help to relieve the stress and anxiety.Headache is probably secondary to tension and anxiety too, so you should benefit from Sertaline and exercise too. Shoulder pain is probably tendinitis or osteoarthritis and will improve with the anti-inflammatory and exercise.

I see a surgeon next week just preparing myself","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern.Unfortunately fusion while it may improve the symptoms on that level doesn't help with other levels, it can even accelerate their damage because the reduced mobility in L5-S1 after the fusion adds the strain on L4-L5. Hence it is not to be surprised to have protrusion on L4-L5 with displacement of L5 root. It does justify your symptoms, although to be sure about that an exam is needed (reflexes, muscle weakness, numbness location) to confirm symptoms correspond to that root and not to remains of old problem.As for remedy usually it is attempted with physical therapy and pain killers, local injections can temporarily help as well.

If its an ischmic stroke, you will need antiplatelets and statins like ecosprin and atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. Eventually physiotherapy may be needed also.I hope this helps you.

At times when it is considered to be due to atherosclerosis of big vessels a  statin is added as well as statin benefits go beyond the lipid lowering effect.Also a cardiac origin must be investigated and if found anticoagulants which are more appropriate than aspirin may be considered.I hope things work out for the best."},{"Patient":"I feel pressure in my head then I feel waves like if I move my head in a certain direction I feel like the inside of my brain moves in slow motion what causes it and does it have a name and how can I stop it from happening it doesn t happens often but when it does it last for a couple to a few days","Doctor":"Hello dear,The symptoms as mentioned in your post can be attributed to pathology in the Vestibular Apparatus in inner ear (it is associated with maintenance of body posture & balance) most probably Labyrinthitis or Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo.Symptomatic relief can be obtained with intake of Vestibular sedatives like Betahistine or Cinnarizine preparations (to be taken only under the guidance of a Physician).If it still persists, then you need to consult your Physician/ Neurologist & get a complete clinical examination done.Investigations like estimation of blood pressure, blood sugar levels, serum electrolytes & vestibular function tests will be required to rule out any pathological cause for the symptoms.There is no need to worry, you will be fine.Till then, maintain adequate hydration & proper nutrition status and avoid stress.And also take precautions of getting up from bed slowly & avoid sudden head movements.Wishing you a Good Health.Take care."},{"Patient":"I have numbness on my hands and sometimes my leg usually when I m asleep but i m not sleeping on them.

Para-spinal muscle spasm due to improper sleeping posture.2. Inadequate hydration & Electrolyte imbalance of the body.3. Dietary deficiencies of certain nutrients like Iron, Calcium, Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, Folic acid, etc. which help in blood formation & nerve conduction.4. Peripheral neuropathy caused due to any fluctuation in blood pressure or blood sugar level.Symptomatic relief can be obtained by intake of nervigenic agents (like Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, Folic acid) as well as multivitamin & multimineral supplements including iron, calcium & Vitamin D needs to be added in your diet.Physiotherapy & postural exercise will also be helpful.If symptoms still persist, kindly consult a Neurologist & get a complete Neurological examination done.Certain investigations like complete blood count, serum electrolyte estimation, fresh estimation of blood pressure & blood sugar levels & nerve conduction studies will be helpful to rule out any pathological cause for the symptoms.X ray & MRI of whole spine can also be carried out to detect any nerve entrapment.Wishing you a Good Health.Take care."},{"Patient":"Over the past three years, always around November, I get a new symptom that requires me to go to the doctors. First my hands went numb, they passed it off as carpal tunnel. The next year, I had muscle spasms in my neck and hands. They said it was nothing. This past year I went in for a reoccurring blind spot in my eye. They found nothing. An MRI showed a lesion on my frontal lobe, but they said it wasn t wnough to make a fuss about. My first cousin has MS, and my grandpa has Parkinson s. Could it be some sort of immune disorder they are ignoring? I m a relatively healthy 23 year old female so I don t think they are taking this as seriously as they should be.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!I would like to have more information on the nature of the lesion found in your MRI. You should know that there are different sequences in MRI exam, which can orientate towords the nature of the lesion (white matter gliosis, inflammation, vascular or tumor). Your symptoms don't seem to be related to a lesion on the frontal lobe. Numbness in both hands is not caused by any lesion in this region of the brain. The spasms of your neck muscles too. I recommend you to perform a cervical spine x ray and routine blood test for inflammation, which could be related to this clinical scenario.Regarding the heredity for MS, I would say that the probability for you to have MS when a first cousin has it, is very low. While Parkinson has other symptoms and no brain lesion in MRI. So I think you should not worry about heredity in this situation. Hope to have been of help!Greetings!

Get a consultation of an ENT Surgeon, have clinical and radiological check up done like CT scan .A correct diagnosis will help correct your problem.As far - for your pooh problem. Green stools are indicative of an infection. The pencil like or watery stool and pain at it indicate you have a problem at the outlet like a stricture or so.

I would like to explain that there are different disorders, which can cause pain in this region : 1- A temporal-mandibular junction arthritis 2- A temporal arteritis 3- An infection of the soft tissues or the sinusesI recommend you to consult with the GP for a careful physical examination, a routine blood test, inflammation tests, thyroid hormone levels, kidney and liver function tests and blood pressure monitoring. A chest x ray may be necessary to rule out other possible causes of hyperventilation.You may need to discuss with your attending physician on a possible increase in the doses of clonazepam. A brain CT scan may be necessary to exclude a possible sinusitis or a brain lesion. I would also advise you to consult with your dentist, for a better examination of the temporal-mandibular junction.

She does not want to go to the hospital what should I do. P.S she does not look like she is in distress she is walking around and taking naps.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, her symptoms may be related to a cervical disk problem causing a radicular pain irradiating in her right arm. Has she complained about neck pain or arm pain before? A wrong position during sleep, can also mimic this clinical scenario. The fact that she is walking around is an indicator that nothing serious has happened (we can exclude a possible stroke, which would have other symptoms too).I would recommend consulting with a neurologist for a careful examination for neurological signs. A cervical x ray and a nerve conduction study may be necessary to establish the cause. Hope to have been of help!Greetings!

When eat really salty food or drink too much coffee in one day I get shortness of breath, my body becomes numb, and my eyes kind of black out. Is this at all normal? And for the 2nd time in my life I got a wave of numbness throughout my body today. It wasn t low blood sugar, because I ate what I normally eat in the mornings.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM! I understand your concern. Your symptoms seem to be caused by anxiety and an excessive intake of coffee. I would like to explain that coffee contains caffeine, which induces an increase of catecholamines in the blood, causing cardiac and nervous system excitation. This would lead to high blood pressure, tachycardia and ectopic beats, anxiety and other autonomic nervous system symptoms (sweating, numbness, blurring vision, etc).   I would recommend performing some tests like a routine blood test, kidney and liver function tests, thyroid hormone levels, blood electrolytes and an ECG to exclude other causes of this symptoms. I would advise you to avoid drinking too much coffee and take plenty of water instead and a healthy diet. Hope to have been of help!Greetings!

My step son had hit his head falling out of a baby chair onto hard tile floor.  He had neurological evaluations for 6 months and they determined that diagnosis.  My true questions are if heavy sleeping (during day), mood swings, and delusions of granduer are side effects that could have derived from such a trauma that occured many years ago.  Reasoning and logical decsion making is heavily affected as well.","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern.Cerebral edema means brain swelling, but it's not a specific sign as it can be present in many types of brain lesions. However considering the length of time he was followed it is obvious that he sustained a brain damage due to the trauma, damage which is permanent, some brain tissue is lost. That traumatic brain impairment can manifest itself with the behavioral symptoms that you describe, it is a common occurrence. Of course that must be correlated with the extent of injury on brain imaging, but it is well possible.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"My blood pressure today was 130/100. I have a seizure disorder and am on Topamax, lamactil and klonopil. I just recently starting taking Norvasc. I started Jan 5th. I feel nauseated all the time too. Are they related? I thought my blood pressure would go down by now.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, your symptoms may be related to norvasc intake (nausea has been seen in up to 3% of patients using this drug) or a possible interaction between topiramate and norvasc. Topiramate can decrease the levels of norvasc (by acting in its degradation in the liver), causing a lower effect of norvasc in controlling the blood pressure. Topiramate has been shown increase the blood pressure in 1-2 % of the patients. It can also cause kidney dysfunction and stones, which can induce a secondary hypertension. I recommend you to perform a routine blood test, kidney and liver function tests, thyroid hormone levels blood electrolytes and an ECG. An ambulatory 24 hours BP monitoring would be helpful to have more information on your blood pressure during the day.  I would recommend changing into another antihypertensive drug (hydrochlorothiazide or an ACE inhibitor). I would also recommend you to consult with the neurologist to consider the possibility to lower topiramate dose or switch into another antiepileptic drug. Hope to have been helpful!Greetings!

Herniated disks can be of different grades. If the disc is herniated meaning displaced and producing symptoms due to compression of nerve roots it won't go away just like that, it will remain there. If there is improvement that is due to the subsiding of the inflammation at the site which might be adding to the compression. Certain times though if there is marked compression surgery might be needed.So recovery times may vary.

The deformities of the spinal column can occur from a wrong position or may also be caused by degenerative disorders affecting the bones, like osteoporosis etc. Spinal column surgery can also cause deformities, when vertebral bodies are taken away. When the deformities are in a high grade, they can cause dysfunction of the heart and the lungs, besides the chronic pain. So It is important to treat this condition. The most important thing is to establish the cause of these changes , by having some tests for osteoporosis or inflammatory disorders. I would recommend a lot of physiotherapy, to help reinforce the back muscles.Another option of treatment would be surgery, with fixation and fusion of the vertebral bodies.

Could this be a heart attack?","Doctor":"hello there,A history of numbness along your left arm with dizziness and also a feeling of unease is a symptom I will like you to get checked out. At the very least you need to visit a physician and get an EKG/ ECG done. Based on the report of the EKG we can discuss further treatment and management as it can easily rule out a heart attack. With your husband being in good shape and healthy living it is unlikely but being safe is better than worrying.

I have had an ECG but that was fine.Could you help with a diagnosis?","Doctor":"Hello there,Based on your symptoms you seem to be having TIA(transient Ischemic attacks). Your brain's blood vessels are not allowing enough blood through them and that leads you to have episodes that affect different parts of the brain. This can be detected if we can visualize the blood vessels supplying to your brain through a digital subtraction angiography and also a CT to study any areas of low blood supply in the brain. Since these tests are expensive I would advise you to consult a neurologist before proceeding further . other possible differentials could be focal seizures of the brain or raised intracranial pressure.

When is surgery necessary? ?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for your question on HCM! I understand your concern. Your clinical situation is very complicated, because colitis can cause irradiating back pain. Tarlov cysts usually are asymptomatic and do not need treatment. But in a case like yours, if the erosion of L3 is near the cyst and not because of osteoporosis, I would recommend to consult with a neurosurgeon for the possibility or treatment. A careful physical examination for the neurological signs would be very helpful to determine if there is any radicular pain related to the cyst. In this case surgery would be needed.

Urinary tract infections would normally have other symptoms such as frequency of urination, discomfort on urination, change in the colour or odour of the urine.If you do not have any of these added symptoms then infection is not likely and the pain may be due to a stone.The ultrasound would be able to determine if a stone is present. The treatment of kidney stones involve the use of pain medication and a lot of fluid.

My brother is 66 and was diagnosed with the disease and has been part of a study in Boston.  My brother is telling me I have alzheimers because I had a seizure.  My question is could the seizure have been from lack of sleep and menopause or should I really be worried that I have alzheimers at 52?","Doctor":"Hello thanks for asking from HCM for your health related queriesI can understand your concern. Alzheimer's disease is a neurological disease and it has multifactorial aetiology. History of Alzheimer's in family is one of important factor that determines disease in a person. Nutrition, education status, activity levels, history of trauma to brain, hypertension, diet etc also determines the risk. Seizures by repetitive brain damage may increase the risk but single episode can't cause disease. You have history of panic disorder and if you have taken Benzodiazepines for its treatment then that is also a risk. Use of Benzodiazepines is found to increase the risk of Alzheimer's and memory impairment. Get your proper evaluation done and examination done to rule out the illness.

Until tried in the evening to put the head in horizontal position - vertigo again... Decided to visit Emergency that night. The problem reproduced in front of the doctor. Given Allerfin injection and made appointment for the evening next day. Well, next day, doctor did an Epley. No vertigo while slowly moving down and turning right and left. However, a very intense (falling) sensation while tilting back the head in vertical position, almost fell out of the bed, could not stand it, doctor put me back in horizontal. After a while, tried it again but much slower, somehow managed it and came back on the feet. Once again, given Allerfin injection. Since then, already 11 days, very foggy feeling, all the time... Moving the head or even just eyes causes a strong imbalance feeling. A minute of focus in front of the laptop is almost impossible, get a feeling as if will fall down. Pretty much not really able to walk or do any activities. As if someone pushes me to the left, to the right. Generally feeling very bad, constant dizziness. Not even trying horizontal position anymore. Some nausea, brought me to the edge of vomiting, however, not vomited. Taking as advised, 3 times daily a 24mg Betaserc. What is happening? Why do I feel so bad after Epley? How long can that last? The doctor in Emergency mentioned two or three days, later another ENT specialist I had visited mentioned around a week; I am already in the second week and it looks like not improving at all... Can you please comment on this and give some advise. Thanks!","Doctor":"I'm sorry you are feeling this way. Vertigo is the sensation of motion where there shouldn't be, often described as the room spinning. It's important to understand that vertigo is a symptom and not a diagnosis. There are many types of vertigo that can often be diagnosed based on the duration of symptoms. If it lasts seconds and can be triggered by a motion to one side, such as laying down to the left in bed, this is Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV), defined by crystals dislodged in the fluid in the semicircular canals. When you turn your head in the direction of the problem, this causes a brief upset in the vestibular system, which is then perceived as vertigo. It is diagnosed by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver and then treated with the Epley maneuver. Often the Epley maneuver should correct the problem immediately. Sometimes it needs to be repeated. There is less common version of BPPV, where the crystals are lodged in the other canal and a complete \\"log roll\\" needs to be performed. If your ENT can't help, consider a neuro-otologist.There really aren't any effective medicines for BPPV, just antihistamines that can make people drowsy.The subsequent symptoms do not sound like vertigo but more of a visual motion sensitivity. This could be from the Allerfin injection. In the US we have a different version of the medicine involved in cold medicine and these symptoms sound very similar to side effects from this. Another possibility is that this is migraine-related symptoms."},{"Patient":"hi i have back pain problem since last 5-6 years actually during the age of 28 i slipped in bathrrom there after severe pain was there in my spinal cod for two days i was on bed . thereafter i get this problem once in every 3-4 months. actually i have sitting job. i have to sit contineously for 8-9 hrs perday","Doctor":"Hi was there any xrays or MRI scans done.

If the thoracic and lumbar are normal, you should still have an MRI of the cervical spine.Regarding the current MRI results -- over the last 3-4 decades that MRI has been around, many patterns have been seen and studied. Chronic small vessel ischemic changes are like having \\"plaque\\" in the brain in parts that usually don't manifest clinically. There are lots of tiny blood vessels in the brain that can get \\"clogged\\" over time which can be accelerated with smoking (second-hand as well), diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, etc. This is the pattern that appears.Now if the MRI of the spine shows something, that pattern could be somewhat indicative of demyelinating disease (not \\"exterminating\\" I believe).

It started in the back if my head and radiated to the center. Since then I have felt pressure on the side of my head and what feels like a bubble at the top of my head.","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern.From that description it looks like a coital headache, a type of headache related to the sexual act. Most times it is a benign headache, which origin can not be determined. However there is a small percentage of cases where a vessel abnormality like a brain aneurism with headache due to its blood leak is the cause. For that reason you should be evaluated for other neurological signs like neck stiffness and possibly with brain imaging.If brain imaging excludes such a cause than management depends on frequency of episodes, if frequent preventive treatment with indomethacine or propranolol may be considered.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"my husband has just been diagnosed with a hiatal hernia. After eating holiday foods yesterday he has had abdominal pain and nausea all day today. He takes omeprazole. Will Pepto bismol give him any relief. Is there anything wrong with doing that.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing to HCM.He seems to be having gastritis along with the hernia. Holiday foods are rich in spices and fat, which increases gastric acid production, leading to pain.Ask him to switch to a combination of prokinetics like levosulpride along with omeprazole, in consultation with his doctor, that will provide better relief.And next time when he is having holiday food, ask him to take those medicines twice a day, or better to avoid them.Dr. Ashish Verma"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have some question that I really want to know, hopefully you can give me the answers, thanks! 1. what color liquid leaks from the nose and is a sign of a concussion? 2.what knid of abnormal eye pupil exam is shown? 3.identify two tests that are done to diagnose a concussion?","Doctor":"1. In a concussion, there shouldn't be any visible changes to the head. If there is fluid leaking out of the nose and it's clear, it could be cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) meaning there needs to be a leak repaired or there could be a meningitis. THis can happen from a cribiform plate fracture often seen in frontal head injuries.2. There also should not be an abnormal pupil exam. If there is one, you need to go to the ER immediately.3. To diagnose concussion, it is basically any head injury that causes an alteration in mental status. There can be tests done but they are usually done to rule out something else like a contusion (blood in the brain) or neck fracture for example."},{"Patient":"Hello, Over the last several months,I have developed pulsatile tinnitus in my left ear.I should mention that I have had occasional stabbing pain in same ear.Several years ago,an abnormal group of blood vessels was found in the same area during a cat scan,but I was told it was nothing to worry about.Recently,I ve developed sharp pain in my neck that radiates down my neck,shoulder and left upper chest.This pain is all on left side and is intermittent.Ive gone to an ENT and was very disappointed with the Doctor.Im currently looking for another.Any suggestions or info would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance..","Doctor":"Hi i did review your concern. What you are experiencing as a radiating pain down your neck and shoulders and chest is what can be called as Lhermitte's sign and it is seen when nerves get irritated. It can occur in multiple disorders and is not very specific. Along with tinnitus i would recommend you get a MRI of your brain and neck done to rule out any potentially harmful condition. Also consult another ENT doctor and get your ears checked by audiometry if there is any hearing loss that you may be developing.I hope this helps.Let me know if you have any more questions or concerns.Wish you healthy and happy life ahead."},{"Patient":"I was getting a blood draw the other day, and the needle hit a nerve going down my right arm. Immediatly I had burning and pain in my arm. Now every time I try to use my right arm I get burning pain in my right wrist area. what can I do to make this better?","Doctor":"Hi I did review your concernYour pain can be due to carpel tunnel syndrome or any bony pathology irritating your wrist nerves. I would advice you to consult a neurologist and he can diagnose the condition and then probably splinting the hand in a dorsiflexed position or local steroid injection will help you relieve of your pain.I hope this helps.Let me know if you have any more questions or concerns.Wish you healthy and happy life ahead."},{"Patient":"I have herniated discs in my Lumbar spine. I have experienced pain for the better part of 5 years, sometimes so debilitating i can t get out of bed. 29 yo F, 3 kids, 9 years in the Army. Moved to Colorado Springs, CO Oct 2008, pain started Jan 2009. I thought it was because I had another child (pregnant Jan-Sep 09). Anyway, on Friday, I drove 14 hours straight to San Antonio Texas for the weekend. I had ZERO pain upon arrival, even after the drive (I was in pain during the drive) and had zero pain all weekend. Could the high altitude be causing (or at least exacerbating) my symptoms and pain?","Doctor":"Hi I did review your concern.High altitude generally does not aggravate lumbar disc prolapse symptoms. the pain of Lumbar disc herniation can occur at virtually any time and especially is aggravated when there is load on vertebra like lifting heaving objects. Spinal decompression can theoretically relieve pain but that requires massive changes in pressure which humanly livable altitude changes cannot cause practically.I hope this helps.Let me know if you have any more questions or concerns.Wish you healthy and happy life ahead."},{"Patient":"I was on my normal 5 mile walk yesterday and all of a sudden going up a hill I got this sudden sharp pain that ran thought my knee cap.

Doesn t bother me to kneel or go up stairs. Today I ve has a few (3) episodes. It s totally random. I do have osteo arthritis. Any thoughts?","Doctor":"Hi I did review your concern.Your electric shock like sensation over knee could be due to nerve root irritation in the back like lumbar spinal stenosis and typically occurs when you extend you back or walk on toes. I would advice you to consult a orthopaedic surgeon who can help you with diagnosis or a neurologist who can also run tests like Nerve conduction tests.A spinal MRI after detailed neurological test would be highly advantageous here.I hope this helps.Let me know if you have any more questions or concerns.Wish you healthy and happy life ahead."},{"Patient":"I have an 18 year old that suffers from migraines. Last year she was in the hospital because of memory loss. When she awoke one morning she couldn t remember what happened the day before or for that matter the week prior to. They ran a battery of test trying to figure out what was going on. She had many different specialties overseeing her case. Now she is at college and is having the same symptoms. Thanks, Karla","Doctor":"The migraine itself can cause memory loss, especially if it is just during the migraine. However, I would make sure she had an EEG (possibly a 3 day EEG) to rule out seizures. There is an entity called transient global amnesia where patients lose time for about 3-6 hours and often never have it again. Many if not most people that experience TGA have a history of migraine. She needs to have the migraines treated appropriately."},{"Patient":"hi Two years ago I had a fall and needed a CT scan of the head. It showed enlarged ventricles and a silent stroke, It was decided that I was born with the low pressure hydrocephalus. I had am MRI last year, It showed no further changes. This September I started falling down on my left side with difficulty standing up without help. I was having to use a cane. I saw a neurologist and had another Ct scan today and will have an EMG in Dec. My falling has stopped and my walking has improved in the last couple of weeks and no longer have any symptoms. Your opinion please. Thanks. Marge","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for your question on HCM!Regarding your concern I think that it may be caused by a second stroke, in the posterior part of the brain or a vertebral artery insufficiency. If the CT scan you did, resulted in no new strokes from the old CT scan, it means that the problem may be a vertebral artery insufficiency. It is caused by a narrowing of this artery causing low blood flow to the brain. Another cause of repeated falling may be the hydrocephalus, which can certainly cause gait problems. I would recommend you to have a Doppler ultrasound of the cervical arteries and to take aspirin for the prevention of a second stroke. I would encourage you to continue with the physiotherapy. Hope to have been helpful!Greetings!Dr. Aida"},{"Patient":"I have been diagnosed with chiari malformation and lumps on my thyroid. My energy has decreased quite a bit and my arms feel heavy and weak. Migraines are an everyday problem now. Vision is blurry off and on, just doing everyday things are a challenge. I have been seeing a chiropractor to help alleviate some of the migraines, but as soon as I go back to a full day of work I feel just as bad or worse. I also have problems with keeping my blood sugar up. I am not sure that this is what s causing this or if there is more going on than I know. Any ideas to what is going on?","Doctor":"First of all, the migraines are an issue with the brain not the spine. If a surgeon does not want to operate on the Chiari malformation then more than likely it has nothing to do with the headaches. There are many reasons to have chronic migraines and these should be evaluated by a headache specialist. Having chronic pain can cause decreased energy and visual issues. Chronic pain can cause lack of good sleep which in turn can cause less energy and more headaches as well. Hypothyroidism can cause this too so if you have lumps on your thyroid then thyroid hormones should be checked as well."},{"Patient":"Just a about a week ago I had notice I had a small scab on my head and that s when I notice an indent on the top middle of my head. It wasn t itchy, sore or soft when touched. I told a couple of co-workers and they look at me like I m crazy. I didn t hit my head or was born with this. I never had this before. It s like you run you fingers across your head and then there is a dip and back up again. Don t know why. Does anyone know? Cancel this is there is a charge. Didn t see it a charge when sent my question.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for your question on HCM!I appreciate your concern. Indentations on the head may be caused by bone or meninges ( brain layers) disorders. The cause may be inflammatory, a tumor or vitamine D insufficiency and low plasma levels of calcium. I would recommend to consult with your GP, have a physical examination and make some tests: a blood analysis for inflammation, vitamin D and calcium plasma levels, and a head xray. A brain CT scan may be necessary to establish the diagnosis.

They are a brain problem. However, there can be feedback from the upper cervical cord (c1-3)and discs that can push on it. Typically a mild disc bulge does not cause this. If the headaches are short lasting and only on one side, this can be occipital neuralgia which can be caused by cervical problem.Typically tingling on top of the head with headaches is something called allodynia which is the sensation of pain where there shouldn't be. This occurs after about 60 minutes after an onset of migraine.Of course, this can also be cervicogenic headache. Talk to a pain specialist who could do cervical trigger point injections and/or greater occipital nerve blocks which could provide some temporary relief followed by physical therapy."},{"Patient":"My friend is having some muscle pain on her right upper abdomen and it is still bothering her even though she has been resting, putting heat/ice on it, and taking ibuprofen.

Your son of 8 years is having epilepsy disorder and he was taking Valprin 200 but seizures persisted. If we consider his current medicines then Selzic or Oxcarbazine is an anti epileptic drug and Livomax 250 is an antibiotic drug. If even on this medicine his seizures persist then in my opinion there is need to add some adjuvant drug for his seizures. Medicines like Levatiracetam can be added to his prescription as add on drug. Combination treatment helps to provide effective control to resistant seizures. Consult his doctor for proper re-evaluation and prescription of the drugs.Thanks, Hope this helps you.

You are 77 years old otherwise healthy female. After 60-65 years of age most of individuals start suffering some extent of cognitive impairment. Your mother had Alzheimer's and this is also an risk factor. You have major problem with memory so I would advise you to consult a neuropsychiatrist for proper evaluation and treatment. MMSE or mini mental status examination is an objective test that can help to find out extent of memory impairment.

It s been almost an hour but I m feeling rather sleepy though they told me I shouldn t sleep until maybe 6 hours. I m not feeling dizzy at all or nauseous, just sleepy, like my eyes feel a little heavy... Should I be worried?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for your question on HCM!I appreciate your concern. I think that feeling sleepy is normal after a head concussion. It is caused by a temporary dysfunction of the brain, and may be a sign of brain swelling. Nausea, headache and dizziness are common symptoms too after a head concussion. I agree with your doctors who are telling you not to sleep, because they are monitoring your conscience status. I would recommend you to have a little rest and do not worry about it. It will get better. If these symptoms get worse or you feel other symptoms like numbness etc, a bran CT scan would be necessary to exclude an intracranial hemorrhage.

The episodes of the groaning and pain last usually few minutes and then he feels better or sleep and it can occur up to 3 times a week. We’ve seen doctors and nothing could be traced to be the cause. Last year the child behave a bit violent during the pain. An EEG was done April 2013 and a temporal lobe epilepsy was suspected and a follow up CT scan showed an appearance of a mass at the temporal lobe. We saw the neuro pediatrician in June 2013 and he was placed on tegretol twice daily had relief for about 3 months then it started again. The doctors have been varying the doses of the tegretol but the symptoms persist. We saw the neuro 2 weeks ago and he recommended an MRI. I just saw the results. It reads something like lesion involving left prepontine, left cerebello – pontine angle cistern, left peri – mesencephalic cistern, left peri – mesencephalic cistern, left …thalamus and mesial temporal lobe appearing hyperintense on T2 and isointence on T1 and is showing mild restricted diffusion. Few area of necrosis is seen within lesion. The report suggested infective (granulomatous) etiology? Koch’s (Tuberculoma). I saw the neuro with the result we are given another appointment.

I read your question carefully and understood your concern. In my opinion the dizzy spells and fainting are caused by a low blood pressure, which causes a low blood flow to the brain during these episodes. I don't think that there is anything to do with a brain tumor. It doesn't cause low blood pressure. I would recommend to consult with your cardiologist and have some changes in your treatment for high blood pressure. I would also recommend to measure your blood pressure during sitting position and standing up position, to see if there is any decrease in blood pressure to confirm an orthostatic hypotension which can be the cause of these problems.

Regarding your concern I think it may be an occipital neuralgia. The numbness of your face may be caused by a hypersensitiveness of the trigeminal nerve in the brain. Cervical column arthritis can also cause this type of neuralgia by compressing the occipital nerve. I would recommend to consult with your GP, have a good neurological examination and a cervical column x ray. A brain CT scan may be necessary to rule other causes like a brain tumor, which may cause similar symptoms.

I would recommend to have a full blood work for inflammation , a vitamine B12 level, a thyroid hormone test, a kidney and liver function tests. If everything results normal it may be a chronic fatigue syndrome or a fibromyalgia , although you don't refer any pain.

Dr. Timothy Hain, Northwestern University, Chicago, seemed to believe I had a damaged vestibular system. One other doctor initially thought that I suffered with mal de dubarquement. Dr. Hain seemed to rule out this condition. What should I do in the way of trying to determine if anything can be done to alleviate my balance problems?","Doctor":"Hello!I read your question and understand your concern.  I agree with your doctors that your balance problems may be related to the inner ear. But they also may be caused by the brain problems or vertebral artery narrowing. The long time you refer with this problems, is more indicating an inner ear problem.  Vestibular tests can diagnose disorders such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo , and perilymph fistula, which commonly occur after head injury; and bilateral vestibular ototoxicity, which commonly is a side effect of medication.I would recommend tests like electronystagmography , electrocochleography , rotational chair test, posturography, fistula test to find out a possible inner ear problem. A brain MRI may be needed if everything results normal.Hearing pathway tests (audiometry, auditory brainstem response, electrocorticography) can also be used for the same purpose, and are frequently combined with vestibular tests.After finding the cause of your problems than we can choose the right treatment.

I would like to know if she had kidney problems before the stroke. The fact that she underwent surgery to reduce brain swelling indicated that she suffered a big stroke, which involved a big part of her brain. It is normal in this condition to be still in coma. The prognosis after a big stroke is poor, and the decompression surgery gives some more chances to be survive.  The renal failure complicates more the situation. It may be a complication of multiorgan failure or low blood pressure or an aggravated renal failure after stroke in preexisting low kidney function. Anyway this complication reduced even more the possibilities of recovery. So I would say that the situation is very serious. You can just pray for her to get through this.

He has developed dementia. There are a lot of causes for dementia at this age. They are Age related dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Deficiency of Vitamin B12, Niacin deficiency, Vascular dementia or Multi-infarct dementia, Dementia due to some infections etc. In my opinion if you don't think he has age related dementia he should be investigated accordingly to the causes I have mentioned. His brain scan would rule out any evidence of vascular damage to brain and vascular dementia can be ruled out. He should undergo MMSE test (Mini Mental Status Examination) to find out extent of dementia. This would help to judge improvement also. You are already giving him supplements.

I read carefully your question and understand your concern. I would like to know what he is taking for his seizures. The brain farts and episodes of violence are common after a head concussion and may be a part of the so called Post traumatic stress disorder. His brain is suffering a dysfunction which involves also the memory and emotional regions of the brain. Some antiepilepsy drugs have a very good effect on these episodes too. Valproate and Carbamazepine are the best treatments for these episodes. I would recommend to switch on one of these therapies which are also helping for seizures and post concussion headache. Some other antiepilepsy drugs like Levetiracetam may aggravate this situation, it improves the seizures , but aggravates the violent behavior. So if he is beeing treated with Levetiracetam, I would strongly recommend to switch into one of the above mentioned drugs.

I have been through your question and understand your concern.Generally, microadenomas are monitored for their biological activity (hormone level) and dimensions. Basically, if your level of hormone is increasing it might understate that the dimensions are increased too. In your case I find it important to consider MRI every 6 months, because if it becomes >1cm, then it will be considered a macroadenoma and surgery can be helpful.Hope this helps.

Medication used are over the counter pain killers like Ibuprofen and muscle relaxants like cyclobenzaprine, however they only alleviated the symptoms the best means of addressing the issue is physical therapy, it's very important. If the pain persists for over 4-6 weeks you should be checked by a doctor because imaging may be required to search for uncommon causes.

It may be associated with infection.-  Mild ethmoid, right maxillary and frontal mucosal thickening, congestive or inflammatory : Mucosa (layer or lining) of sinuses is thickened which may be due to infection (inflammatory) or allergic (congestion).Above findings may indicate infection that may present with fever, cough,cold, throat pain. - c4-c5 disc means layer in between cervical spine (bone) no 4 & 5. - osteophyte means bony spikules.- ventral: anterior or to the front.- subarachnoid space: it is a fluid filled space surrounding the spinal cord.- c4-c5 disc osteophyte complex partially effaces the ventral subarachnoid space: It means bony spikules causes compression of subarachnoid space anteriorly.- mild reversal of the normal lordotic curve is seen either due to position and/or spasm: It means loss of normal curvature of cervical spine (convex anteriorly) ie. loss of curve and spine become straight which may be due to position (position of head and neck while doing MRI) or spasm (muscle spasm)Above findings may present with neck pain with stiffness, pain radiating from neck to shoulder or arms."},{"Patient":"pea size lump upper right quadrant hurts when pressed.

I read your question and understand your concern. I think that these symptoms may be caused by a small stroke. I would like to know if you  have measured your blood pressure. Do you suffer from arterial hypertension or diabetes ? The headache is not a common symptom in stroke, but it may be related to migraine, high blood pressure etc. I would recommend to consult the neurologist, have a good neurological examination, a full blood work, a blood lipids analysis and a brain CT scan. Further tests like cardiac check up and Doppler ultrasound of the carotid vessels may be needed to establish the cause. Hope to have been of help.

In my opinion the problems you have may be cause by contractions of the back of the head and neck muscles. There are different causes : a wrong position during the day or a nerve compression from a degeneration of a disk in the cervical part of your column. I would recommend to consult with your GP, have a good physical examination, and a cervical column xray.

After the perforation the intestinal contents spread in the peritoneal cavity. The intestinal ( appendix is a part of intestine) contents contain bad bacteria and once they reach the peritoneum, infection becomes widespread. Sometimes even the best antibiotics may take time to control the infection.The white foul smelling discharge is pus from peritonitis. This is coming from the peritoneal cavity. The bad odor is produced by the breakdown of the tissue by the bacteria as a byproduct of the process of pus formation.Pus culture and sensitivity guides for the best antibiotics which may help fasten the process of controlling infection.

I read carefully your question and understand your concern. I would like to know your age and if you have a family history for tremor. There are different causes of tremor. As far as I understand from your description, yours is an intentional tremor, which gets worse when you try to reach for the target. In a young patient I would think about a metabolic cause like hyperthyroidism. While in older patients I would think about  essential tremor, a degenerative disease or a stroke. But the gradual beginning of your tremor rules out a possible stroke. A positive family history for tremor would be in favor of essential tremor diagnosis. Sleep apnea can cause tremor in the hands during the day, but it would improve with the good treatment of apnea.So I would recommend you to consult with the neurologist and have a full blood work and the thyroid function tests.

These symptoms are caused by a temporary brain dysfunction due to the head trauma, and the temporary loss of the brain ability to auto regulate its function . The warmth on the side of your head may be related to the edema of the muscles and the soft tissues of this region. The brain does not hurt. I would recommend some pain killers for some days and a lot of rest. You should avoid straining physical activity for some days. If the situation gets worse , instead of improving, and you may feel confuse or numbness on your limbs or gait problems, I would recommend to go to the emergency room and have a brain CT scan to exclude a possible intracranial hemorrhage.

The pain in your legs and numbness, the gait problems, may be caused by a possible polyneuropathy.

I don't think it is an aneurysm, as they rarely cause pain and in that region you would feel throbbing headache and pulsating noise in your ear. The fact that it hurts when you think about it is another factor in favor of a psychological problem.I would recommend to consult with the neurologist, have a good neurological examination.

I think that your father may have a peripheral facial palsy, which in most of the cases is caused by a viral infection or the cause is not found. I would like to know if he has had problems with expressing himself and answering the questions before , from Alzheimer disease , or it has started now with the face problem. Does he have a slurred speech or he can't express words.A peripheral face palsy can be caused by a possible stroke in the brainstem , but it is not associated with difficulty expressing , only with slurred speech from the dysfunction of the muscles involved in speech. Other symptoms like paralysis or dizziness would be present in case of a possible stroke.  So, I would advise you to consult with a neurologist, have a good physical examination .

Question: Will I need surgery?","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern.The decision to undergo surgery though is not taken solely on your imaging results but also on what symptoms do they cause and their intensity. Also usually conservative treatment and physiotherapy is always tried for some months first.If you have intense pain which hasn't responded to physical therapy then I believe surgery for the changes in L4-L5 with severe canal and lateral recess narrowing. At time if the symptoms do not correspond to compression at this level nerve conduction studies are done beforehand to make sure which level needs to be addressed.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"Hi, I just spent some time with my dad and for the first time witnessed him having restless body movements. He has bee n complaining about jaw pain and numb tonge.......he also mentioned that his right arm is going numb. Last night my brother witnessed an episode that he has described as body twitches, flailing to a more severe level than I witnessed today. Any thoughts?","Doctor":"Hello ! I read carefully your question and understand your concern. I think that the symptoms you describe may be related to different disorders, which you should exclude. The body twitches, also called myoclonus or fasciculations (depending on the amplitude) may be caused by Epilepsy seizures, cervical column disorders affecting the spinal cord, Motor neuron disease , polyneuropathy etc. I would recommend to consult with the neruologist and have a good neurological examination, a full blood work, a head CT scan and an EEG . Other tests may be needed like : Vitamin B12 levels, Electromyography and Electroneurography,  and cervical x ray.

I think that the symptoms you describe may have been a seizure, a complex partial seizure, but they may also be caused by sleep disorders. As you refer you have painful leg cramps during the nights , which can be restless leg syndrome . Seizures may be caused by sleep deprivation. I would recommend you to consult with the neurologist, have a good neurological examination , a full blood work and an EEG for the possibility of seizures. Another examination that I would recommend is a polysomnography, which is very helpful in the diagnosis of sleep disorders. A brain CT scan may be needed in case of an abnormal EEG or neurological examination.

Tumour is stable at Present but he has developed an itch rash on his body and acne like pimples which have not responded to antibiotics . Any ideas?","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for your question on HCM!I understand your concern. I think that the rash may be caused by two main problems: an allergic reaction to epilim or a hematological problem and low immunity caused by avastin. The first is the most possible. Avastine would typically cause red pinpoins on the skin or redness but not itchy rash. I would recommend to have a valproate plasma level and  a full blood work, liver function tests. I would also recommend to switch to another anticonculsivant drug like Levetiracetam, which has no interactions with avastine and is effective for different types of seizures.

I read your question and understand your concern.I think that there is nothing to worry about. All the symptoms you describe are common symptoms of anxiety. A chronic anemia can Be the cause of fatigue.

They may also be asymptomatic and cause progressive gait and memory decline.In her situation I would think more about normal pressure hydrocephalul.

Now Tues night she just had the appearance of blood in one nostril. No excessive blood just around the lining. Should I be concerned about growing pressure on her brain or possible fracture?","Doctor":"Mild concussion?Was there any fracture?Were there any symptoms?Ok if it is a minor trauma to head association with mild injury to nose then bleed can even  occur some days after injury if the clot formed previously was dislodged due to breathing or movement of nares. A x ray and endoscopy of nose will get the diagnosis.Usually head trauma do not lead to nose bleed if it is minor trauma. ENT bleed occurs if severe head injuries. Sometimes CSF may be lost from nose in such cases.I do not thinkur child nose bleed is due to direct effect from head injury that is from edema of brain or hemorrhage in brain as it leads to many more symptoms like weakness seizures headaches vomitings altered brain functions. Do not panic and take child to your treating doctor,meanwhile pack the nostril only one which is bleeding with gauze piece like a stack of ironed clothes pressed together ,like a pile,like a treponemal shape,if it is heavy bleeding till u see doctor"},{"Patient":"I was was told that I have Gillian barre syndrome.

Still how many days I have to use these medicines.","Doctor":"It depends on the size of clot it is assessed by ct/MRI scan.MRI being less harmful is preferred. Actually the ischaemic area can be calcified on ct scan,it can give rise to seizures hence eptoin lobazam must be continued even after resolution.Blood test of pt inr gives us the status of coagulation in body as dose is adjusted accordingly,roughly saying your clot status present and future,.Mostly it could have resolved by now,but ct confirms it.also u must take anti epileptic treatment life long"},{"Patient":"what would cause a sharp pain that feels like my stomach is ripping out but yet it burns like crazy it is right by the edge of my right rib cage at the top and goes around to my back right next to my spine. If I eat it gets worse If I do not eat it still burns and hurts but not as bad","Doctor":"Hello dear,The symptoms as mentioned in your post is attributed to accumulation of gas secondary to increased acid production in the stomach.Symptomatic relief can be obtained with intake of Pantoprazole preparation (to be taken twice a day before meals) & antacid gel (to be taken after meals).They prevent formation of excess acid in the stomach & provide symptomatic relief.And it is also needed that you take certain precautions regarding your diet & lifestyle, such as:1. Take soft, plain, non-spicy foods2. Drink lots of water to maintain adequate hydration3. Avoid fast foods & gas producing food products like cabbage, etc.4. Avoid smoking & alcohol.5.

Intracranial hemorrhage in infants is a very common problem in premature or low weight infants. The low hemoglobin levels predispose him for low oxygen flow to the brain with further aggravation of the situation . Vitamin K injection is done in all infants after birth to prevent hemorrhage, but when hemorrhage happens there is not much to do, besides symptomatic treatment. The baby should be held in the intensive care unit , with oxygen support, and symptomatic treatment to avoid seizures and respiratory insufficiency. Blood transfusions may be helpful to increase the blood cell count. The diagnosis of the intracranial hemorrhage is made with repeated ultrasounds.

The most simple thing would be a low blood pressure or an orthostatic hypotension. I would recommend you to measure your blood pressure regularly and in two positions, sitting and standing up. A decrease more than 30mm Hg from sitting to standing position would be indicative of orthostatic hypotension.Another cause would be a vertebral artery insufficiency or from cervical spondylarthrosis causing compression of the vertebral artery. It would also explain the back pain. A cardiac arrhythmia can cause similar symptoms too. I would recommend you to consult with your GP , have a full blood work to rule out anemia. A doppler ultrasound of the cervical vessels and a cervical column xray would also be needed. Other tests for the heart like an 24h ECG monitoring , and a Heat up tilt test for orthostatic hypotension may be necessary. Hope to have been of help!

It is normal in some persons more than others, who may be more sensitive to have an autonomic reaction to the pain. Your symptoms are very consistent with a presyncope , which would be a loss of conscience. In cases of pain or when a vessel is damages , there is an overstimulation of the vagal nerve ( the main autonomic nerve in our body), causing similar symptoms.  You should not worry about it.

Your daughter symptoms may be related to a meningitis or intracranial hemorrhage. The headache is often normal after a head concussion, but the fever is very concerning. I would like to know if you have noticed any leaking from her nose or ears or neck stiffness after the trauma. If a tearing in the brain covering layers is caused by a trauma, it can lead to an infection  called meningitis. Meningitis can cause headache and high fever.

There are many disorders causing a collapse, like : cardiac problems, metabolic problems, neurological problems, etc.The numbness and tingling in your arms, blurring vision, inability to concentrate and loss of balance , put all together with a normal CT scan, make me think of psychological problems and anxiety . Tension type headache would be associated with this situation. It is typically a diffuse headache like pressure or tightening. Although I would recommend a good neurological examination and a brain MRI just to exclude any other neurological disorder where the CT scan has a low sensitivity.

The occasional head and back pain may not be related to the trauma. It is more possible to  be caused by muscular contractions from degenerative changes of your spinal column, or a possible wrong position during the day.

I read you question and undestand your concern. It is very common to have headache after head concussion or trauma. It may be caused by the muscle contractions in the scalp, or by an irritated occipital nerve from the trauma. I think that it will get better spontaneously. You don't have any other symptoms like gait problems or numbness in your limbs. This is an indicative sign that there is nothing wrong with you ( like an intracranial hemorrhage for example). So I would recommend to have some rest. There is a high risk after a head trauma to get in a serious condition if the trauma is repeated. For this reason it is very important to be careful for a month after trauma and to avoid possible other trauma. Regarding the headache I would recommend painkillers for some days.

I am 47 years old and absolutely miserable.","Doctor":"Hello ! Thank you for the question on HCM! I understand your concern. The pain which aggravates by the bowel movements is not related to the bulging disk, but it may be a spastic colon( a disorder caused by irritation and contraction of the great intestine). The fibromyoma can cause similar pain, but it is more related to uterine hemorrhage. You should consult with your gynecologist for this issue.The back ache radiating to the feet is related to the bulging disk and chronic degenerative changes in the bones. I would recommend a lumbar bracelet for the pain and avoid standing position and sitting position for a long time. Physiotherapy would be very helpful to you , reinforcing the muscles of the lumbar region. I would also recommend Amytriptiline or Gabapentine which are very effective in chronic pain. These drugs should be used for some months. Hope to have been helpful ! Best Wishes, Dr. Abaz Quka"},{"Patient":"Hi. My 16 y/o son suffered a hit at football yesterday. Today he has h/a and vertigo.

With a negative ct and if symptoms do go away, would it be safe 4 him to go?","Doctor":"Hello ! I read your question and understand your concern. The brain function is not normal after a head concussion and the brain loses for some days- weeks its plasticity. This means that in this perioud the brain is very vulnerable and a second head trauma can cause a serious situation called \\"Second injury impact\\". Going to the cedar point would expose your soon to a second trauma , may be not direct trauma, but maybe from the speed acceleration etc. I would recommend to avoid straining physical activity and risk of further trauma for 3-4 weeks .

I feel a lil better now that was like 15 mins but got a headache. Did I just lack oxygen to the body from coughing and laughing so hard","Doctor":"Hello ! Thank you for your question on HCM! I think you are right and the laugh and coughing may have caused a gap of oxygen perfusion to your brain. Another explication would be the abrupt raise in the intrathoracal pressure causing a vagal nerve response and other changes.

So my concern now is i ve been recently experiencing a vibrating sensation as if a needle is being punctured from the outside of my skin to in. starting from the beginning of my eyebrow of where my nose is traveling around my eye and then to the same starting point. I also have been experiencing extreme pressure around my left temple area. i am aware that i should receive a MRI scan of the brain but at this very moment out of curiousity i was wondering if you could direct me in any direction.","Doctor":"Hello ! I read your question and understand your concern. I think your problems may be related to contractions the the head muscles. Another explication would be a temporal artheritis ( an inflammation of the temporal artery), but it would also cause blurring vision , which you don't mention. I would recommend a full blood work for inflammation first, to exclude the temporal artheritis. If no problems I would recommend Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen and alprazolam for some days. I don't think these symptoms may be related to any aneurysm. But I would recommend a brain angio MRI  to exclude a possible aneurysm as an incidental finding given the relative high risk for that , due to family history. Hope to have been helpful! Greetings! Dr. Abaz Quka"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am a Medical student...my mom is suffering from a serious condition i.e pressure in the head as well as bleeding from the ear ..this all happend when i took her to a cardiologist for check up..high B.P depression and arthritus was confirmed...after taking the medication prescribed by the doctor...the same condtion is suffered i.e pressure in the head as well as bleeding from the ear..sir what could be the cause of it????","Doctor":"Hello ! I read your question and understand you concern. This symptoms may be caused by uncontrolled high blood pressure. Have you measured her blood pressure during the episodes. This would be very important for the diagnosis. Other causes would  be an ear infection like otitis or mastoiditis , but she would also have problems with hearing or fever. I would like to know if she has had any problems with bleeding in other part of the body before, because this could also be caused by a problem with coagulation or the intake of anticoagulants. A full blood work and a brain CT scan would be necessary. Hope to have been helpful!

I read carefully your question and understand your concern. I am sorry about your problems. You seem to have a very problematic cevical column. In my opinion you should consult with a neurosurgeon. It is not just a matter of pain. The signal change in the cord is indicative of a cervical myelopathy,which is caused by compression from the dislocated discs and the narrow spinal canal. With the progressive narrowing of the cervical canal you will also have gait problems besides the pain and difficulty in your everyday activities. So it is important to treat the problem before aggravating. For the pain I would recommend you to hold a cervical collar and start Gabapentine or Pregabaline which are two drugs very effective in these cases. Hope to have been helpful!Greetings!Dr. Abaz Quka"},{"Patient":"I had 7 unexplained seizures last week were I was then tested in neurology while staying in the hospital with no conclusion. Tonight, I got very hot and dizzy followed by an upset stomach. When I was lying down, I had lots of random muscle twitching. After that stopped, my legs were very heavy and tired. Is this likely a small seizure or events leading up to a seizure","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for the question on HCM! I understand your concern. The random muscle twitching are part of generalized myoclonic seizure. It is not a small seizure, but a generalized one , meaning that the brain cell dysfunction is spread all over your brain during this seizure. The hot and dizzy feeling which the upset stomach are part of an Aura ( symptoms preceding the seizure, part of the seizure)I would recommend a prolonged EEG and a brain MRI to find out the possible cause of these frequent seizures, besides full blood work , electrolytes and other tests. You need to start an anti epileptic drug as soon as possible , based on the consult with the neurologist and the results of the above tests. Hope to have been helpful!Greetings! Dr. Abaz Quka"},{"Patient":"A couple of times in the last few days, I've had a feeling of being punched in the gut, a few inches above my belly button. I haven't eaten right before the pain and I've thought maybe I NEED to but the thought of food when I'm this uncomfortable makes me feel sick. I'm female also. What could it be?","Doctor":"Hi, Based on your medical history, pregnancy could be a possible cause. I suggest to get a pregnancy test to rule it out. If pregnancy is excluded, PCOS or premenstrual syndrome could be other causes. I suggest to have an abdominal ultrasound for further evaluation. If everything with your genital tract is normal, then, should consult a GI specialist and run upper endoscopy and stool examinations to rule out GI pathology. Dr.Sejdini"},{"Patient":"I just woke up now, It s 7pm. It was a bit of an offsleep, but when i woke up i felt really weak, shaky, almost lighter. I m still shaking now. I tried just waking up a bit, Drinking some water and milk, Went to the bathroom. But i still fell weak shaky and light,","Doctor":"Hello !  I read your question and understand your concern. In my opinion the symptoms you have had may be related to a drop in your blood pressure. You should measure your blood pressure in sitting position and than in standing up position . A decrease more than 20 mm Hg in your blood pressure would be indicative of orthostatic hypotension. Low blood pressure can cause similar symptoms. I would also recommend a full blood work for anemia , a thyroid function test to rule out hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Hope to have been helpful! Greetings!Dr. Abaz Quka"},{"Patient":"I have MS and fall often. Yesterday I fell forward landing very hard on my breasts. They hurt.Muscles under arms are hurting also.

Today began experiencing neck tightness. What is wrong with me? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello ! I read your question carefully and understand your concern. I would recommend you to consult with a GP as soon as possible and have some tests done. In your situation I would think of infections, which could be located in the cervical column or meningitis. These two disorders have similar clinical patterns. A full blood work for infection and a good neurological examination are very important . You may need further tests like a cervices-thoracal column CT scan or a lumbar puncture to establish the cause and the wright treatment.

I m currently under a Pain Management doctor here in Colorado and need to move to Mobile in the next couple of weeks. I need surgery to fix the problem and can t afford the surgery. No insurance as of right now. My last doctor would not order scans or proper procedures to diagnose the problem therefore causing the the problem to get worse. Continuing to prescribe opioid medication without proper diagnosis caused him to lose his license. He did this with several patience leaving many of us in the cold and with no treatment. In my case. I became so sick that I lost my job, insurance and means of support due to his negligence. My father lives in Mobile so for my well being and sustainable life I have chosen to move in with him so that I may find the proper help. In the meantime...I need to continue my pain management so that I can continue living my life (for what it is) until I can come up with an alternative plan for my treatment and an insurance that will take me there in Mobile. Given the current state of affairs with pain medicine and the prescribing of such medicine; I m sure you can see my concern with leaving my current situation. The pain in my back is unbearable and must be dealt with as soon as I relocate. On a personal note; I ve dealt with many doctors that were very cold and uncaring to mine and many other patient s conditions. I would prefer to avoid this type of treatment immediately and find a doctor that is well educated in the science of spinal injury and the pain associated with this injury. I can obviously have records sent ASAP for a doctors use and will be happy to undergo any exam needed to prove my condition. Thank you for your time.","Doctor":"Hello ! I read your question carefully and understand your concern. I would recommend a cervical column MRI to examine better the anatomical problem and if there is any compression to your spinal medulla from the displaced disk. The MRI would also examine the grade of the possible displacement of the disks, and would also help the neurosurgeon to decide if surgery is necessary. As far as I understand from your case you have been using for a long period opioid. They lead to tolerance development and dependence over the time. So I would recommend for the pain an antidepressant like amytriptiline , which is very effective in chronic nerve pain, and helps with your emotional state. Another good option would be gabapentine, an anticonculsivant , very effective too. These two medications should be given under medical prescription and do not cause dependence or tolerance.

Blood test report is _ ACHR ANTIBODIES , ACETYL CHOLINE RECEPTOR ANTIBODIES _ 20.1. Nmol/l please suggest me.what can I do???","Doctor":"Hello ! Than you for the question on HCM!Regarding your concern I would say that his antibodies are really high . The small effect of myestin, is very indicative for a possible progression of the disease. This disease can lead to respiratory insufficiency, causing high morbidity and mortality. So I agree with your doctor to have a more aggressive treatment. We should put into balance the side effects of this drug and the benefits, taking into consideration the severity or this disease. Another option would be steroids. But they are contraindicated in hypertension, diabetes or gastritis and ulcers . I don't know if your father has any contraindications to oral steroids. I would also recommend a thoracic CT scan for thymoma, or thymic hyperplasia. This high level of antibody may be related with this disorder. Surgery would be very helpful in that case. Hope to have been helpful!Best wishes, Dr. Abaz Quka"},{"Patient":"My mom has a fractured S1. In the hospital pain control is a femoral patch, tramadol and oxycodone. Her mental status has been affected immensely. It seems to have intensified her dementia. We have decided to eliminate the tramadol. Was that a good decision?","Doctor":"Hello ! I read your question and understand your concern. It is common for dementia to aggravate after surgical interventions.I think you have done the best thing to stop tramadol. Elderly patients with dementia or Alzheimer’s disease may exhibit increased symptoms of confusion or agitation while taking tramadol. There are a lot of pain killers which can help in her situation . Regarding dementia I would like to know more about her treatments. There are different therapy like Cholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine. Memantine is another drug effective in Alzheimer but also other types of dementia . You can use antipsicotic too for agitation if needed, Hope to have been helpful!Best wishes, Dr. Abaz Quka"},{"Patient":"First light headless starts with blurr vision, then numbness in left arm occurs which also goes to my left hand.

Right now I am fine but woke up with left ear pain, this could be unrelated, but felt like stating the issue.","Doctor":"Hello !I read your question carefully and understand your concern. I think your symptoms are very likely to be migraine. The blurring vision and numbness in your arm and hand are migraine aura, common symptoms preceding migraine headache. I don't think that there is a connection between your ear troubles and your migraine attacks. Two attacks per month are not too much. I would recommend treatment with Risatriptan or Sumatriptan within the first symptoms preceding headache. These drugs are very helpful for the pain relief in migraine attacks. If your attacks become more frequent, you should consult with a neurologist, have a good physical examination and other tests to rule out other causes. A prophylactic treatment may be initiated in that condition. As for your ear you should consult with a ORL specialists, if the pain persists.

He has been taking gnu for 3 sessions and is receiving avastin treatment biweekly. He also has a shunt in his right side. He is experiencing pain in his ankle and muscle spasm when he walks. Any ideas if this related to the tumor or the medication","Doctor":"Hello ! I read your question and understand your concern . A brainstem tumor can cause different symptoms , like troubles with swallowing, breathing, spastic paralysis of four limbs, imbalance and problems with the gait, double vision , facial numbness, loss of hearing , raised intracranial pressure causing headaches and loss of vision etc. I think that the muscle spasms when he walks are related to the spastic paralysis from the brainstem involvement from the tumor of from the brain damage from high intracranial pressure (you refer that he has a shunt for this problem). This is a very common symptom in cases like this . I don't think that the muscle spasm are related to any medication. So I would recommend  a lot of physiotherapy and stretching for the muscles. Baclofen would be very helpful if the pain is severe and the muscular contractions are interfering with his daily activity.

I read your question and understand your concern. In my opinion the symptoms you describe may be related to several problems. The main cause may be a stroke, causing loss of sensibility in half of the body, causing unsteady gait and inability to control the hand properly.Another problem would be a polyneuropathy, typical in diabetes , but it is associated with pain and tinglings in both feet and hands. Diabetic patients can also have seizures from high blood glucose, causing numbness in half of the body , but these are episodic, non permanent. So to conclude I would recommend a good neurological examination, a full blood work, HbA1c and a brain CT scan. If these tests result normal , an Electroneurography for polineuropathy and a EEG would be necessary. Hope to have been helpful!

Several years ago I had a scan after hearing all music off-key. A small pool of blood was found but the doctor felt my body would absorb it and treatment wasn t needed. The pain I m experiencing is in that exact same spot. No answers after an MRI, just had another today but this time with and without contrast. I fear again no one will find anything out of the ordinary. Can you suggest possibilities my neurologist can rule out?","Doctor":"Hello ! Thank you for your question on HCM! Regarding your concern I would like to exclude primary stabbing headache, and an occipital neuralgia. I would like to know the location of the pain. If it is in the back of your head it may be occipital neuralgia. As you mention brain MRI is normal. So the main causes of secondary headaches have been excluded. The diagnosis of primary headache is clinical and no other tests are needed to find out the type of headache. In both the headache types that I have mentioned above, treatment with Indomethacine twice daily is very helpful. If no results I would reccomend Topamax or Amytriptiline.

If left untreated, it might cause severe complications including sepsis. I suggest to run to ER as soon as possible.

I am 52 years old and work on a computer all day. I have been bothered with allergies and have had congestion with no fever. I have been taking Claritin D.","Doctor":"Hello ! Thank you for the question on HCM!Regarding your concern I think that your troubles are related to the wrong position of your back during work. The wrong position during sitting causes muscular contractions of the back muscles. It is during night that you feel the pain, because your body is in silence, and you are lying down. I would recommend a lot of physical activity, which can help to reinforce your back muscles, and stay in a wright position during sitting. Physiotherapy is also helpful. You can also use pain killers like acetaminophen for the tightness.

The doctors localy just dont have a clue.","Doctor":"Hello ! I read your question and understand your concern. In my opinion the troubles he has may be related to his inner ear. The hearing loss is very typical of this . As you mention in your question , he has done several tests. I am taking into account that the brain MRI has resulted normal, because a tumor of the right pontocerebellary angle would give similar symptomes. Diabetes can cause cranial nerve neuropathy.The impaired vision may be related to cataract. I would recommend an ophthalmologist consult to examine better the problem. If the problem is outside the eye, but in the optic nerve visual evoked potentials would be necessary to locate the problem. The acustic and vestibular nerve can be affected by this disorder.I would recommend brainstem auditory evoked response, which would confirm the diagnosis. The numbness in half of the head may be related to the trigeminal nerve disorder, like the two other nerves mentioned above.

It is very unlikely that enlarged lymph nodes to be related to Chiari malformation, so other causes of swollen lymph nodes should be evaluated.For this you need to consult your primary care Doctor.Symptoms related to Chiari malformation include headaches worse after coughing or straining, spastic arms and legs, (difficulty walking, working), severe snoring at sleep, difficulty swallowing or choking during meals, wasting of hands and legs muscles, numbness around mouth etc.If you experience these symptoms, you need decompressive surgery of posterior fossa to correct Chiari malformation.If no symptoms, or only slight headaches, you need only follow up.Hope this answers your question.

I suggest to start taking simethicone for gas and probiotics to optimize intestinal flora. If your abdominal pain is also associated with changes in bowel movements, I suggest to get your stool examined for ova/parasites and cultured too. Abdominal ultrasound is necessary to rule out abdominal pathologies. It will take few days to get the symptoms relieved.

Then you say you waited for a month to visit the emergency room which makes the cerebral edema a little questionable because it is a very serious finding with the patient often in a coma. Afterwards you say you had no tests but a MRI, which actually is the best test to detect edema, but tell us nothing of its findings. You close it out telling us to have taken treatment by allergy doctor and got better.So I as a doctor started out thinking you had a dramatic life threatening condition like encephalitis and ended up thinking it looked like the more benign sinusitis or rhinitis.So please try to ask your question again. Try to avoid fancy medical terms like cerebral edema which might not be correct, and tell us your symptoms in plain simple words (headache, vomiting, nose congestion and discharge, fever etc) using as many details as possible to describe their onset, character and frequency.

They sent her home and then there about 20 minutes ago she had another seizure just after she walked down the stairs (with someone on front and behind her of course ..just in case) to take a drink and then next minute she said my sisters name and took another seizure.. please if anyone has any answer i would be greatful!!","Doctor":"HIThanks for posting your query.     First of all I need to know what exactly was her heart rate at the time of seizure . A mild elevation in heart rate and be made voluntarily but extreme fast heart rate means she is not doing it by herself.    Also observe her when she is alone without coming to her notice . If any time she gets seizure when she is unaware that she is being observed then it means that she is not faking it . Also observe her eyes at the time of seizures .    For the time being let us assume that she is making it by herself . In that case it is due to some Psychological problem which requires to be tackled by a Psychiatrist. So for the time being get a Psychiatrist Consult. Hope this information was useful to you. Any clarifications feel free to ask. Regards."},{"Patient":"I feel lightheaded for two days straight, when I lay down I feel a bit better but still same condition. My balance is unsteady, on the first day I felt like fainting, I was shaking but not because of chills or feeling cold , my head feels heavy as if someone gave me morphine. on the second day I feel dizzy and weak, and same thing and I don t have a temperature..","Doctor":"Hello ! I read your question and understand your concern. In my opinion the troubles you have may be related to low blood pressure , orthostatic hypotension or anemia. I would recommend to measure your blood pressure in sitting position and in stand up position. A drop more than 20mmHg in your blood pressure during standing up would be suggestive of orthostatic hypotension . I would recommend also a full blood work to rule out anemia. If all the above tests are ok, I would advise a thyroid hormone analysis. A hypothyroidism and a hyperthyroidism can cause similar symptoms.If the problem persist a neurological consult and examination would be necessary to rule out any neurological problems.  Hope to have been helpful. Thank you for using HCM!Greetings, Dr. Abaz Quka"},{"Patient":"My husband 55 years old had an ischemic stroke of the left thalamus 6 months ago. He is unable to regulate his sleep. Sleeps up to 16 hours a day, and can t wake himself though he tries in the morning with alarm clocks and phone calls he requests from his sons. He s getting frustrated with it, and knows he ll need to be able to wake himself if he is ever to return to work. His memory and motor skills are functional - the sleep is the biggest issue now. Any ideas?","Doctor":"Hello ! I read your question and understand your concern. In my opinion he is suffering for hyipersomnia. It is more common in thalamic stroke. Unfortunately there is not a curable therapy to this problem. I would give some advises to try to regulate his sleep cycle:  -Sleep a few hours longer at night to avoid excessive sleepiness during the day.-Exercise daily in the morning or early afternoon, if possible.-Engage in enjoyable activities that require your full attention, such as spending time with friends, writing letters, or playing with a pet.-Try to go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day.-Get out of bed and stay out of bed until bedtime.-Avoid foods that make you sleepy and heavy meals during the day.-Avoid alcohol and caffeine.I would also try Modafinil , which is a drug effective in primary hipersomnia. This drug must be prescribed under a neurologist prescription.

That resulted in pain in my shoulder that eminated down my arm into my funny bone , and on into my wrist/hand. It seemed to very slowly heal, although never disappeared completely. The other day, it seemed to come back to where it was many months ago. Will an impingement ever heal completely?.....does hot or cold therapy help?....should I have an MRI?","Doctor":"Hello!I read your question and understand your concern. I think your problems are related to a nerve Entrapment which is related to the trauma. If I were your doctor I would recommend an Electroneurography to examine the nerves of this arm and the place of entrapment. If a severe compression is found a MRI must be done and it may need surgery. If a small compression, immobilization ist helpful. Hot or cold procedures are not very helpful. I would recommend Gabapentine for the pain management and acetaminophen. Hope to have been helpful!Best wishes. Dr. Abaz Quka"},{"Patient":"My husband is 80 years old and has dementia.

I read your question and I understand your concern.In my opinion the swollen knee is not related to any neurological problem. I think the main cause of his problems is arthritis from degeneration of the bones and ligaments of this joint.I would like to know if he has had any trauma or fall. I would recommend you to consult with a rheumatologist first and have a full blood work, inflammation tests and a xray of the knee. If a traumatic injuryor fracture suspected in the xray I recommend you to consult with an orthopedist. A MRI of the knee would examine better the problem.

All my blood tests came back fine and so did my stool sample. I have been sent a referal to a neurologist but I am starting to feel im losing my mind. Ive lost weight going from 65kg to 56kg in 3 months without change to my diet. Although I am not feeling hungry as much as usual im making sure im eating. I did have diarrhea for about 6 weeks where I was going to the toilet 20+ times a day with no found medical reason. Having no recolection of important things people have told me. Trouble concentrating on things. Unable to go with the flow of conversation and forgetting what im saying halfway through. Hot flushes like someone has poured a bucket of warm/hot water on my head and it flows down my whole body. Fainting spells where I feel like im shaking. Zoning out when talking to people. Friends and family have commented on how I constantly repeat myself during one conversation or telling then the same thing multiple times because I didnt remember telling them or stand there staring. Nausea and vomitting (not always together). Some severe headaches (about 8 in this time frame) I feel like its hard to focus my eyes and am seeing white spots and lines sometimes very bright white. Hot feet at night. Sweating even though I feel cold to touch. I have suffered from anxiety before but do not believe this is because of that. Ive never felt more in control of my mental health. I feel like im living in another world and its starting to effect my everyday life. I do not drink any alcohol or do drugs. I am no longer on any medication but did take anti psychotics to help me sleep for about 2 months in this time frame but it started before and continued after use. Thank you in advance for your time :)","Doctor":"Hello !  I went through your question carefully . I understand your concern. There are many points in your situation that need to pay attention. The lost weight and frequent diarreas can cause nutritional deficiency , causing your memory problems. There are some main disorders that may be the cause of your problems. A hyperthyroidism can cause this clinical situation , so I would strongly reccomend thyroid hormones analysis to rule this out. This would explain also the hot flashes. A rare disorder , called pheocromocytoma , which is a tumor of the surenal gland can cause similar troubles. I would like to know if you have measured your blood pressure during your troubles. If these episodes are associated with high blood pressure and tachycardia I would recommend the analysis of metanephrines in your urine, to exclude this disorder. Another point would be a food intolerance like gluten intolerance, so you should also be checked for anti-gliadine antibody. But this would be exceptional at this age, as it begins since childhood. If all the above tests result normal, a neurological evaluation and a head MRI would be neccessary. Hope to have been of help!

I normally bring fruit but no t lat night I ate a snickers... shortly after... I felt weird.. dizzy confused like I was going to fall I felt like everything was in slow motion","Doctor":"Hello! I read your question and understand your concern. I dont think that there is anything to worry about. In my opinion the problems you have had are related to changes in blood sugar level. You should know that fruits are a resource of slow release glucose. While chocolates and desserts are resource of fast release sugar. So you have a high amount of sugar directly in your blood after a chocolate which causes your body to produce an appropriate high amount of insulin which can overcome the blood sugar level and cause hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is often associated with fainting sensation. I would recommend to avoid chocolates during your break and try fruits or toast instead.Hope to have been of help!Greetings"},{"Patient":"My lumbar spine mri impression stated slightly heterogenous marrow signal intensity appreciated on the opposed phase images at the s1vetebral body.

Surgical intervention might be necessary to improve the symptoms. Hope it helped!Dr.Sejdini"},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, My tailbone has been killing me for the past few months. The pain is a heavy - pressure kind of pain. My MD had X-rays taken, this showed nothing. I saw him the other day and told him I still have this pain.

I end up leaning on my side when I sit, but when I get up, the pressure/pain is terrible. I notice the pain/pressure even when I walk. Hurts when I sleep, especially turning over. I do want to mention that I had a colon resection back in 2005. I had a tumor in my rectum. The surgeon could feel my tumor, that is how low it was. I am worried I may have another tumor. PLease give me some advise what I need to do. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME!","Doctor":"Hello! I read your question and understand your concern. In my opinion the pain you have may be related to a sacral bone problem. I would like to know if you have fever or problems with the  stools . these problems may be caused by a tumor infiltratin the sacral and coccigeal bones, by an infection of this region like an abscess or osteomyelitis, or by irritated nerves of the region from radiotherapy. Your past medical history is very concerning. You didn't mention radio or chemotherapy . So I would recommend a good physical by your GP, a full blood work for infection and a CT scan or MRI of the pelvic region to exclude these causes.Hope to have been helpful!Best wishes Dr. Abaz Quka"},{"Patient":"I get this shooting like nerve pain in the left side of the back of my head, Not horrible, annoying. Same spot. Sometimes if I have a little heartburn the shooting sensation will appear. Same spot, no worse. I thoght it may be tooth related since I did have a root canal done of the left side. I have been back to my dentist and he doesn t see anything.","Doctor":"Hello! I read your question and understand your concern. In my opinion the shooting pain in the back of your head is very suggestive for occipital neuralgia. I don't think it is related to your tooth as there is no anatomical relationship between the two structures. Teeth may cause trigeminal neuralgia, which is in a different location. Occipital neuralgia may be caused by the compression of the nerve in the upper cervical region. Denerative cervical spine disease may cause it or maybe also the standing position of your head in the dentist's chair. I recommend you to take indomethacine twice daily for 10 days of course if no stomach problems. It is very effective in this type of headache. If the problem persists I would recommend you to consult with a neurologist and have further tests.Hope to have been helpful.Best wishes Dr. Abaz Quka"},{"Patient":"i feel head pain sometimes.Then I go to the neuro medicine doctor.The doctor advised me to perform city scan of brain.accordingly i carried out the cityscan test where mild celebral atrophy was detected and prescribed medicine accordingly. my question is this major problem?

I get blurry vision and headaches for about 15min after hard workouts/races and become very lethargic for the rest of the day even after eating and drinking water. The ATs thought it was hypoglycemia so I ve been eating carbohydrates before races and intense workouts (which never do anything and I still have the same symptoms). I ve been checking my sugar after races/workouts and it is around 200-250 mg/dL. Coaches also assumed my fatigue may have been from anemia. Ferritin level was 15 and I have been taking iron and vitamin C everyday for 3 months. My fasting glucose is usually around 105-120mg/dL. Is there a possibility I might have type 1 diabetes?","Doctor":"Diabetes doesn't seem likely with those sugar numbers.  When your symptoms come on do you feel LIGHTHEADED at all, faint, or otherwise zoned?  Are you usually breaking a pretty good sweat when this all happens?  Are you cutting weight for your running?  Have they taken your orthostatic blood pressures?  Have they measured your BP's orthostatically when you feel this way?  Have you had blood work done, imaging study of the head, EKG, or a Holter monitor?  I am a neurologist and I also compete as well as assistant coach a varsity NCAA wrestling team here in Cleveland, OH so I know a lot of these sorts of issues as related to our guys and every year at least 1 or 2 of them get into similar problems.  Of course, wrestling is a different sport from track and weight losses play a major role in our sport that can get people in trouble if they're not careful.  But across the board, hydration and cardiovascular issues seem to be the 2 most important other issues in exertional sports that get kids in trouble from a medical perspective.You say you're anemic?  And you're taking iron?  But have they also checked magnesium levels?  If you have a magnesium level deficiency and you are anemic...no matter how much iron you take you will never correct the anemia.....so little details like that keep people from getting better.  Of course, a bigger question for me is WHY ARE YOU ANEMIC?  You shouldn't be....you're an athlete, your diet should be top notch, your sleep habits should be top notch, and your training should be intensive but controlled and carefully overseen.  You should hydrate FREQUENTLY DURING PRACTICE AND COMPETITION.If you'd like I'd be happy to speak with you more 1-1 and help you organize things and make recommendations for you to get testing done to try and figure this out.Write to me more specifically for information by answering the questions above that I've asked you at:bit.ly/drdariushsaghafi and I will answer you quickly.Don't forget to designate your question as that for SPECIALIST CATEGORY as I am a neurologist.Cheers!"},{"Patient":"My husband, on Coumadin , had a fall out of bed.

They did a craniotomy to remove a build up of blood. then they did some surgical repair to stop the bleeding. They also put me on Keppra 1,000 Mgs. a day then reduced the dose to 750 mgs. at night & 500 during the morning. It makes me feel tired I also had a small stroke but I have recovered from that stroke I believe . Can you tell me how long I may need to take Keppra? I am also a Heart transplant patient for the last 18 months doing well with that.WHy do I need to keep taking Keppra and for how long? Thank you Edward","Doctor":"Hi there Edward, the recommended length of time to take Keppra after a craniotomy for intracranial bleed varies from patient to patient. It is common that some patients (though most tolerate it really well) complain of feeling tired, or a bit \\"foggy\\" with the medication. The length of time determined usually depends on factors like if you had any seizures due to the bleeding, or any after surgery, and how much residual blood there is still in the brain. I would recommend that you coordinate with either your neurologist or your neurosurgeon (whoever prescribes the keppra for you) to determine whether or not this is a medication you can safely taper down, but as it is an anti-seizure medication I would not decrease the dose without a physician to supervise. Hope my answer is helpful to you."},{"Patient":"My husband had an injection in his back L4/L5 for extreme pain. He has had 4 lumbar operations.

He has taken it several times at home (a write B.P. machine) and it is still high. The latest was 182+/90+. This is not an occurrence that always happens. I feel it is hypertension from the injection. Should he go to bed and sleep (relax) and if it is still that high in the A.M. go see a doctor? Please, he is 67 , watches his diet and excercises. What should we do now, if anything. Thank you. Darlene (on behalf of Richard)","Doctor":"Hi Darlene, that is a very high blood pressure and is definitely abnormal. Pain can certainly cause elevated blood pressure, but if he is not having pain (or less pain now after the injection), his blood pressure is very high. If he is having any symptoms at all, like headache, blurry vision, weakness or numbness anywhere with this high blood pressure he needs to go to an emergency room right away. If he is not having any symptoms at all and his blood pressure is in the 180s still at rest, then I would recommend that you coordinate with your primary care doctor as soon as possible, as he may need to be started on an anti-hypertensive medication, or undergo a workup to find out why he is suddenly developing elevated blood pressure.

A CT scan or an MRI of your lumbar spine would be where I would start, (to be organized through your primary care provider), and if those show specific areas of narrowing or compression, your primary care doctor can refer you to a physical therapist who will teach you exercises and stretches that are tailored for you. Epidural steroid injections done at a pain clinic (can also be coordinated with your PCP), can also be of great help for folks that are suffering from sciatic type pains. If those conservative therapies fail, then surgery may be of help. I wish you the best and hope my answer is helpful to you!"},{"Patient":"Good Evening, my fiance is a TBI patient.

I would like some more information, and I think that perhaps you ought to consider going to see your family physician. Feeling anxious and depressed for brief periods mean your symptoms could be related to panic attacks. However, the headaches that you are describing could be from a number of different causes. They could be cluster headaches which often respond well to treatment. Elevated blood pressure can cause headaches, but usually it isn't related to headaches that come and go like yours. Overall, I think it's best if you discuss your symptoms with your primary care doctor, who will be able to obtain more information, check your blood pressure, and write you a prescription for any medication you might need for your headaches.

These can cause life threatening complications like meningitis, so it is important that you seek medical attention without delay. It sounds like you had a brain tumor involving the skull base and the olfactory nerve, and though I don't know what approach your neurosurgeon took, a cerebrospinal fluid leak is a known complication any time you undergo a craniotomy for tumor resection.

It would be helpful to know exactly where the pains are occurring (for example, on one side of the face, or the back of the head, side of the head, etc). From what you describe, however, the symptoms of occasional crippling, sharp pains from time to time could potentially either be related to trigeminal neuralgia, or possibly cluster headaches.

It was normal until one day at school I felt very sick, and got up to go to class, but I got lightheaded and dizzy, I kept walking until I lost vision and hearing and fainted. I went to the hospital and they took my blood but found nothing wrong with me. Why is this happening?","Doctor":"Hi there, it sounds like you might possibly be affected with orthostatic hypotension, since you have been getting lightheaded associated with position changes. It can happen often in young people with low blood pressure at baseline, especially if you are a little tired or dehydrated. I would recommend you make an appointment with your primary care doctor about this problem, as sometimes he or she can prescribe you a medication (like midodrine) or a stimulant to help you with this. They can also run tests on your heart (in case the hospital didn't when you went) to make sure there is no cardiac cause. In the meantime, I would recommend that you make sure you stay well hydrated, and of course please do not continue walking or staying upright when you are lightheaded and dizzy in order to avoid fainting again. I wish you all the best and hope my answer was helpful for you."},{"Patient":"Hi. I suffer from panic attacks. I had gone to my doctor with a mucusy tight feeling in the right side of my throat. I started to hyperventilate very badly. I was not wheezing, my chest was just tight from hyperventilating. I was told I have asthma? Now I am in a constant state of panic and am now agoraphobic. What can I do?","Doctor":"Hello!I read your question and understand your concern.I would recommend an antidepressant in your condition. I would choose excitalopram as it is very good in anxiety. Another good option would be buspirone. These drugs begin to show their action after 2 Weeks, so I would also prescribe alprazolam three times daily for the first two weeks and in case of panic attack.I would also advice you to avoid caffeine and alcohol as they may trigger panic attacks.Hope to have been helpful!Best wishes Dr. Abaz Quka"},{"Patient":"My 6 year old presented 13 days ago with possible appendicitis, they put him in for 24hr observation and concluded that since he was having diarrhea now but no progression in pain it was just Colitis. He went back to er because still having diarrhea and decreased appetite and abdominal pain but they said his blood work looked ok. Two days later he had severe headache and high fever so we took him back in and he tested positive for influenza B. Here we are on day 13 of decreased appetite and what we thought was his stool returning to normal but now it s turning soft again and they have mucus and white rice looking pieces.(side note is he doesn t eat rice) Please help, no one seems to know what is going on, I m worried that we can t seem to go even a full 24hrs without diarrhea.","Doctor":"Hi, It is common to have changes in bowel movements when having viral infection (viral gastroenteritis) and associated loss of appetite. It will take some time until his bowel movements will be back to normal again. I advise to : - get your son plenty of fluids (water, soups, juices)- get him rest more- give tasectan for diarrhea and probiotic to stabilize his intestinal flora- give O.R.S. to prevent dehydration- get his stool cultured and examined for ova/parasitesWish fast recovery!Dr.Sejdini"},{"Patient":"My husband came down with Bells Palsy last Sunday morning. He is taking the prednisone prescription and using eye lubricants and doing facial exercises. We have followup with PT and the Internal Medicine Doctor. The doctor stresses the importance of eye lubrication, but did not put much emphasis on the ear, which we are wondering about. Is there possibility of underlying tumor which may have caused this and how would we discount that possibility?","Doctor":"Hello!I read your question and understand your concern.Ears are not affected by Bells palsy. Rarely hyperacusia may be caused by Bells palsy but it gets better with time, when the nerve regenerates. The abrupt onset is typical for afrigora palsy or idiopathic. It may be viral or just an irritation of the nerve by physical factors. Tumors cause gradual palsy. So I would say that this would be very exceptional in this case. If other symptoms like numbness or gait problems develop I would recommend a brain MRI to rule out any other cerebral lesions.Hope to have been helpful!Best wishes Dr. Abaz"},{"Patient":"Hi i had a seizure 6 months ago after a night where i took an E i know i know dumb. I felt like i couldnt breath, a weight was bearing down heavily on me and i woke up i forgot where i was and had no recollection of it. The second time 2 days ago i went out again. I hadnt eaten had been up all day and i barely drank. It was a gig with colourful flashing lights i was fine one moment then next thing i know i get the sick feeling of everything rushing at me i got very hot. And i woke up to my bf holding me, i had also wet myself. Again no recollection, the first time was in a house but the sexond time was in public. The last few days i have felt slow sick and tired my stool is black and i was constipated pkease help","Doctor":"Hi there, I think that your history of multiple seizures is very concerning. The first time sounds like it was associated with taking Ecstasy, but the second time it may have been caused by your exposure to the flashing lights. My concern is that you might have an underlying seizure disorder, or that your threshold for seizures might just be a little bit lower on the spectrum compared to others. I would recommend that you go to an emergency room right away and get evaluated. The doctors there might start with some pictures (CT or MRI) of your brain and also place you on an anti-epileptic medication. The next step might be a referral to a neurologist. In the meantime, I would avoid brightly flashing lights and taking any recreational drugs since those may have been factors in your last two seizures. I would also not drive or operate any heavy machinery by yourself until you have been cleared by a doctor, since your seizures are unpredictable right now. I'd certainly also avoid heights, swimming or tub bathing without supervision, for the same reasons. I hope you feel better soon and I hope my answer was helpful to you."},{"Patient":"1 year history of dizziness in a 15 year old female. Dizziness is brought on when sitting still in school. Reports that she feels like her eyes can t focus. Subsequent reports of dizziness when looking up. All vestibular testing is normal and patient no signs of BPPV. No reports of headache, recent head trauma, or anxiety.","Doctor":"Hi there, it is hard to know exactly what is going on without a little bit more information, but has anyone obtained any imaging of the brain (either a CT scan or an MRI) in the past year? A problem in the pineal region, brainstem, or even multiple sclerosis, could cause difficulty with eye motions and perhaps the complaints of dizziness when looking up. I would recommend starting by coordinating with your primary care doctor to obtain an MRI Brain with and without contrast, and then possibly referral to a neurologist or neurosurgeon depending on those results."},{"Patient":"I have a pulsating or pressure pounding in my head. It has no pain or sound. It disrupts my hearing as it goes on & off. Some of the triggers seam to be talking on the phone, laughing hard, a room full of a lot of noise, alcohol, or maybe just nothing. Some times it last for hours and other times it will last for minutes. It has been going on for years, around thirty . It seemed to start when I came to Florida to live. No Dr. will pay any attention to me even though it has been a real heart ship for me.","Doctor":"Hi there, I am sorry to hear of the difficulty you are having. It sounds like you might be having a sensation called pulsatile tinnitus, since it is disrupting your hearing and it is pulsating in nature. Sometimes this is from an unknown reason, and many folks have it, but sometimes it can be caused by an intracranial vascular abnormality- a problem in the blood vessels in the brain. I would recommend you start by coordinating with your primary care doctor, explain your symptoms, and work together to obtain imaging of the blood vessels in the brain, specifically to rule out an arteriovenous malformation or a dural arteriovenous fistula. I hope my answer has been helpful to you."},{"Patient":"My sister has been very ill for over 5 months now. She had a baby on January 28th this year. And after maybe one month later, she started getting sick. She s had so many symptoms that it s been hard to diagnose. She said it all started after she drank some coffee/cappuccino from Bad Ass Coffee in Albuquerque that was sitting in her car all day. She started by having constant headaches and a pulling sensation in her head and mouth. She started having trouble sleeping. She keeps taking sleeping pills, not only to sleep. But also to try blocking out her pain. Her family has told her not to take sleeping pills. But she won t listen. She s been very weak, and says that she feels like her body is turning into stone. She can t even tell when she s hungry, or when she has to go to the bathroom. She s also been losing weight from not eating much. She s also been having a burning feeling in her stomach, and says it feels like her stomach is being squeezed. She keeps sending me text messages saying she s dying, and telling everyone she loves them. Her husband and 2 older kids (8 and 15) are at their wits end. She s been to several doctors, had multiple blood work and MRI s, and everything keeps turning out negative. Nothing is showing any problems. I can t remember if she s had a CT scan? What can POSSIBLY be wrong? She s scared to death, and she s been an emotional wreck. A recent doctor gave her some sort of antacids etc., but apparently they haven t helped. There s definitely some sort of neurological problem as well, because she always gets twitches and jerking all over her. She s always saying that it feels like something is pulling her down. Our whole family is at a loss for ideas, and we re all very worried. It s nearing 6 months now. It don t look like our family will be celebrating the holiday season this year.","Doctor":"Hello ! I read your question and understand your concern. In my opinion the symptoms you describe may be related to postpartum depression . It is a very common disorder affecting women after delivery. The repeated analysis and MRI are another argument in favor of this diagnosis. This is not a neurological problem, but a psychiatric one. I would recommend you to bring her to a psychiatrist , to examine here and to choose the best antidepressant for her. I am sure she will get better after starting an antidepressant. She has anxiety too, and here twitches in the body and the gastric pain are related to that. An antidepressant in effective against anxiety too. Hope to have been helpful!

There may also be minor annular bulging at L5/S1. The foramina are all intact. I have problems standing for to long is this something that can be fixed and is it a result of my injuries or just age I am 45, please help","Doctor":"Hi, I have gone through your question and understand your concerns. These lesions found in CT are derived from both your age and repeated trauma.At this point, treatment consists on rest when symptoms are severe, warm procedures on your back, avoiding wheight lifting, NSAID drugs and physical therapy.These measures should improve your symptoms.For NSAID treatment, you should consult your primary care Doctor.Hope this answers your question.

Followup appt in 5-days with neurologist. Appears this is a common symptom of concussions however question how concerned I should be. No other notable symptoms other than what appears normal pain and associated headache which is being treated symptomatically.","Doctor":"Hi there, it sounds like you sustained a concussion during your car accident, and you are now having a metallic taste in your mouth. Though it is difficult to say without seeing the scans myself, it does not sound like there was any sign of any bleeding in the brain or any fracture at the skull base that would make me concerned for a CSF (cerebrospinal fluid leak). A symptom of CSF leak can be metallic taste in the mouth, but it sounds like all your scans were negative for any findings of this. Odd tastes in the mouth can also be a sign of seizure, though again this would be very unusual without any other symptoms and with no visible injury to the brain (like bleeding or bruising) on your scans. Given that the concerning possibilities like CSF leak or seizure are most likely ruled out, I would tend to agree with following up with your neurologist, and to take things easy, relax and let your body heal."},{"Patient":"Hello I have secondary progressive MS. I have been told to take Vitamin B12 pills to help with my memory and tiredness. I am not sure how many B12 pills to take. I take one 1000mg pill a day. I am also on Citalopram 10mg and Baclofen 10mg. What dose of Vitamin B12 is it safe to take. Brian Measer. I am 64 years old.","Doctor":"Hi there Brian, The dose of Vitamin B12 that you are taking is ok (one 1000 mg pill a day). It should not interact with or negatively affect your secondary progressive MS. Vitamin B12 is excreted by the kidneys, so any extra that you take (that your body does not need) will be excreted out in your urine. Based on your other medications, it does not sound like any of the other medications you take are for kidney problems, and the B12 dose you are taking is a standard dose. I would continue to take the dose you are on now."},{"Patient":"Hello! I went to the ER the day before Thanksgiving for constant dizziness, headache, and nausea. I had a CT scan and MRI done that showed I had a 1cm pineal cyst on my brain. I meet with a neurosurgeon on the 16th of this month and I am so scared they will dismiss this as nothing and tell me that cant be causing my symptoms. The dizziness is horrible and that s the only thing I really want gone. I have a 2 year old son that I cant even run around with without feeling like I am going to fall on my face. Is there any kind of medication to get rid of dizziness or will I be left like this? I know they sometimes do surgery to remove those cysts but I have a feeling that wont happen after everything I have read.","Doctor":"Hi there, your sensations of being off balance along with the headaches and nausea are somewhat concerning to me. Without seeing your scans, it is hard to say, but I would be concerned about the location of the cyst and whether or not it is causing problems with your eye movements, and also with what kind of lesion this is. I would also want to make sure that there is no problem with the Cerebrospinal fluid pathways in your brain and that they are not blocked in any way by this lesion. I think that it is alright to wait until your appointment, but if you develop worsening headache, nausea, vomiting or confusion, go to the Emergency Room without delay. I'd also call your neurosurgeon that you have an appointment with and just ask if there is anything he or she may recommend for your dizziness."},{"Patient":"I arrived in New Zealand from a long haul flight this morning. I am currently suffering from vertigo while standing up and I would really like to know how I can relieve these symptoms fairly quickly without sleeping (I would like to get in to the time zone routine). Thank you.","Doctor":"If your vertigo is associated with the room spinning (or a sensation of movement even though you are still), and there are no other symptoms associated with this, like weakness, numbness, difficulty hearing, etc, then a trial of meclizine (start with 12.5 mg by mouth twice a day) may be helpful. A scopolamine patch from your physician may also help. If you are having symptoms of vertigo only when you move your head, I recommend going to see your doctor (or an ear nose throat specialist) to have them perform Dix-Hallpike maneuvers, as you may be suffering from BPPD. (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo). If you are lightheaded when standing up but the room doesn't spin and there is no sensation of abnormal movement, you most likely are suffering from orthostatic hypotension and at this point I would recommend trying to stay well hydrated and you can consider also purchasing some over the counter compression garments for your legs."},{"Patient":"Yes,  a family relative has a prostate removal 10 days ago.

She had some rehab after the surgery and came home yesterday... what do you suggest for the treatment. and what is her prognosis? Mary Ann","Doctor":"Hi Mary Ann, do you have any follow up scheduled with a medical oncologist? Adenocarcinoma is a type of non small cell lung cancer, but there are many different kinds and it is hard to know how to prognosticate without knowing exactly what kind your sister has. A medical oncologist will be able to answer your questions about the extent of disease in her body better than your neurosurgeon. Do you know what the plan for treatment is of her cerebellar tumors? Sometimes, depending on the size of the tumor, your sister may be a candidate for additional surgical resection. Other times, Gamma Knife/or radiosurgery is recommended. I wish you and your sister the best of luck and hope this was helpful."},{"Patient":"I am 40y male with hypertension and I have had back pain for the past week. Last week I was throwing a football and over extended my throw. It caused some brief pain in my right back by the scapula and spine. Later that night I was sitting on the couch leaning forward and started to feel an intense sharp pain in my right chest. I sat up straight and it went away. It did happen a second time that night from leaning forward. The next couple of days I felt like I had a knot in my back and some tightness. Eventually this led to me waking up with the right side of my back swollen and having random shooting pains in my back and chest. It got to the point where I was in so much discomfort that I went to the ER. The hospital did verify that it is not a cardiac issue. I am out of the hospital now and was told to take ibuprofen and rest up. Which is what I am doing. I am just concerned about my symptoms. I generally feel very run down with feelings of having a hot face, a little diarrhea (maybe from the pain meds at ER?) and elevated blood pressure. Is it normal for back pain to cause symptoms like this?","Doctor":"Hi there, it sounds like the doctors at the hospital thought this might be costochondritis or perhaps muscle strain/ spasm given the recommendation for ibuprofen and rest. If no CT scan or MRI was done of your Thoracic spine, that would be the next step if your complaints of shooting pain don't get better (especially if they wrap around your chest to the front) to make sure there is not a bulged disc there that is causing your symptoms. Back pain specifically is not known to cause elevated blood pressure, but pain certainly can do this."},{"Patient":"how to strenthen my spine. i have fracture at L2, in the past I had on at L1 and L5-S1 IN 2009 BY LIFTING a heavy bos.

There are many, many different kinds of L2 fractures, and some are unstable and others still require surgery. If physical therapy was recommended, then for your safety I would recommend going to a physical therapist as your doctor recommended for strengthening exercises."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, I haven t been able to fall asleep for the last couple of days, and I am getting a cold sensation that is running into my head.

It's not caused by any neurological process or illness I am aware of. Are you getting fevers or chills otherwise? I think that you are right, the stress is most likely the reason you are having trouble sleeping at night.

It is true that these symptoms can be caused when the patient is tired, and he can't concentrate. But I would try to exclude first other causes of these symptoms. Slurred speech can be caused by transient ischemic attacks or seizures. At his age he is at risk for these disorders.

When I told the psychiatrist that she had some trouble eating because of her tremors, he prescribed 10mg of propranolol twice daily. What do you think?","Doctor":"Hello ! I read your question and understand your concern. Divalproex can be the cause of tremor. I would recommend to have a plasma level of divalproex to rule out overdosage. Although 1000mg/d is not a high dose. If she stops divalproex the tremor probably will stop. But I would take into account the benefits in seizure control of divalproex. It can be switched also into another drug for the seizures, such as lamotrigine, which is better in young females. Propranolol is a drug very effective in tremor , and also safe in this situation. It can cause bradycardia , so the dose must be tapered to patient toleration . So you may choose to continue on divalproex and propranolol or switch into a new drug for seizures. You must consult with your doctor for these options.Hope to have been helpful!Best wishes Dr. Abaz Quka"},{"Patient":"If i was sent to the emergency room because of high blood pressure and given medicine on a drip, which fixed me up.

I read your question and understand your concern. I would like to know if he has had seizures before the 3 last seizures you mentioned. The increased daytime sleepiness may be a side effect of phenytoin sodium. This happens in the beginning of therapy or overdosage.But in this situation I would recommend to make further tests to find the cause of these seizures. If I were his doctor I would perform an  EEG and a brain MRI or CT besides full blood work. Seizures at this age may be caused by a brain lesion , probably tumor or vascular, infectious, etc. This lesion could also cause stiffness in legs.

I understand your concern. Headache is a common sign after head concussion. It may be normal, but it also may be associated with complication like late bleeding to the brain, also called a subdural hemorrhage. Sharp pain at the back of your head is not very typical of a subdural hemorrhage. I would like to know if you have other problems with your gate or nausea or vomiting. If you don't have any other signs , I would recommend just to walk in the Clinic, because no emergency. If you have other signs, I would recommend you to go to Emergence for a brain CT scan, to rule out the complications I mentioned above.

In my opinion the problems of your husband may be related to a low blood flow to the brain, causing Transient Ischemic Attacks. These events  may be related to the heart , as you refer that he has elevated pulse rate , erratic, which may be atrial fibrillation. Repeated TIA lead to high risk of stroke if not treated. I would recommend to consult a cardiologist, and have an ECG and a ECG 24hours monitoring and a cardiac ultrasound to see the heart output. He may need anticoagulation if FA , due to high risk stroke. A brain MRI and a neurologic examination would be helpful. I would also recommend and EEG , as these signs may be also caused by epilepsy.

I read your question and understand your concern. Parkinson is a clinical diagnosis. The main clinical sign is slowness of the movements, and can also be associated with difficulty in initiating the movement, tremor and rigidity. It may be drug induced. The brain MRI is normal in Parkinson disease. An argument in favor of Parkinson is the good response to Levodopa treatment.  You say he is taking Syndropa , which is Levodopa. If I were his doctor I would recommend him to continue this treatment. You can try not to give Syndopa during lunch , and you will see that he will get worse. When you will give the tablet later , he will be ok again.  This means that the treatment should be continued.

The signs of nerve root relief would be the relief of your pain , the return to your normal physical activity. The fluttering is not very significant.

In my opinion the troubles you have are related to muscular contractions of the scalp muscles and the neck muscles. The main problem may be in the cervical spine, degeneration of the bones or the intervertebral disks, causing irritation of the nearby structures ans muscular contractions. I would recommend a cervical Xray to examine this part of your column for these problems. The headaches and the tightness may also be attributed to psychological stress, to a wrong position of the head and neck during the day etc. The tightness in the head is the typical pattern of Tension type headache.

Oral calcium supplements and Vitamine D in the form of calcitriol would increase calcium levels in your blood and stop osteopenia from progressing. However, at high doses, calcium supplements can cause gastrointestinal side effects, such as constipation, in some people.Diet modificatiol would also be helpful:dairy products rich in calcium like: green leafy vegetables, broccoli, kale, and fortified orange juice and breakfast cereal and low in phosphorus-rich items.

I don't know the MRI pattern, but a stroke in a diabetic patient may be misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis in MRI because of lacunar strokes and periventricular post ischaemic lesions. The difference may be done by a contrast enhancement which is consists with multiple sclerosis. The fact that the motor deficit is persistent is more consistent with stroke than multiple sclerosis. I would recommend a lumbar puncture with oligoclonal bands for diagnosis multiple sclerosis though not always it results positive.I would recommend him to keep taking aspirins and a statine as hypolipemiant to prevent a possible stroke.

It also was locking up and felt like it needed to be cracked. The hand specialist had me wear a brace with top and bottom supports that I absolutely could not tolerate because it made the top of my hand and wrist hurting and got really tingly and cold. He gave me one without the top support and a cortisone injection. I wore it for 8 weeks. For two weeks I didn’t wear anything when I then started getting constant tingling on the top of my thumb, pointer finger, top of my hand and wrist...no symptoms on the bottom. Since, I have had constant tingling in my right thumb and pointer finger. I have a brace on most of the time, otherwise it is much worse and gets very cold and hurts on the top of my wrist. You can physically feel the temperature difference between each hand. Today I had an EMG and the one where they put needles in your muscles. One of the shocks was supposed to go only down into my thumb, but it made horrible pain in my pinky finger. When he did my cercal spine area (I have spondylosis) it went up into my head and not down my arm. After this test he wrote the report and I saw the hand specialist. He said my EMG and tests were normal!!! ... as he was inspecting my hand, which was in a constant tingle and very cold. The report did say I may have a neuroma on the nerve above my wrist that goes into my thumb, but the hand doc said he didn’t think this was the case, even though he could touch the area above my thumb up to above the inside of my wrist and it would produce strong tingles in my thumb on demand.

A neuroma is an abnormal overgrouth of the nerve in the region of the injury , after the nerve has been cut off from the trauma. It develops some time after the trauma. The changes in color and temperature in both hands are in favor of a nerve injury. Your symptoms also mimic the so called carpal tunnel, which is caused by the compression of the median nerve at the wrist.

I understand your concern. I would like to know if these symptoms are persisting or resolved now. The symptoms that your son has had may be related to alcohol intoxication. But its plasma level has to be above 80mg/dl to show these symptoms. He has presence of alcohol in his blood and so alcohol has to be taken into consideration in this situation. May be his brain is more vulnerable to the age ( school age, you have not told his age ). But also other diagnosis have to be excluded like a possible subarachonoid hemorrhage, possible meningitis or just migraine . Has he ever had throbbing headaches ? Did he have fever? It would be a sign of meningitis. Also neck stiffness and  headache. If the symptoms persisted a head CT scan and a lumbar puncture would be necessary to rule out subarachnoid hemorrhage.

The muscular spasms may be caused by a lumbar spine lesion , infectious, inflammatory etc. Even straining physical activity can cause muscular spasms usually because of a disc displacement. I would recommend you a full blood work to rule out infection and inflammation and a xray of the lumbar spine. I assure that it has no effect on breastfeeding. If the problem persists a lumbar CT scan would be necessary to examine better the lumbar spine.I would also recommend avoiding of straining physical activity, cold packs on your back and massage in this region to have pain relief and release muscular contractions. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen would cause pain relief and are safe in breastfeeding.Hope to have been helpful!Best wishes Dr. Abaz Quka"},{"Patient":"I was sitting down and had a weird sensation in my brain, like a pop near the top followed by a fluttering sensation that flowed down across my brain and lasting maybe 2 seconds.

I have been through your question and understand your concern.The cervical discs and spinal stenosis are common findings in the MRI and not always related to serious problems that need surgery. Neck pain is not an indication to surgery, while weakness of the extremities and sensation problems are, which are caused by medullary compression. I think the neurosurgeon after seeing you decided to opte for no surgery because luckily you dont have medullary compression. The chiropracticers do no have any competence on surgical indication.

That report speaks of changes which are not specific and could have many different origins. Most commonly they are seen with advancing age especially when there are conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes etc due to chronic changes in your small blood vessels (but some changes do occur with age even in the absence of those other conditions). So if your husband is an elderly person your doctor didn't discuss it with you because he considered it a normal finding.

I understand your concern. In my opinion the symptoms you have are oculogyric crisis and they may be a side effect of antiepileptic drugs like carbamazepine. I would like to know which antiepileptic drug you are taking. They can also be caused by other drug, stress etc. Some times they can be part of epilepsy signs. I would recommend you to go to the doctor. You may need measurement of plasma levels of antiepileptic drugs depending on what you are taking and a prolonged EEG. If the problem persists you may need medication like lorazepam, amantadine or change your antiepileptic drug.Hope to have been helpful!Thank you for using HCM!Dr. Abaz Quka"},{"Patient":"I might be having surgery for Arnold chiari malformation and I am meeting with the neurosurgeon again today and I am just looking to see if there are any specific questions I should be asking, there isn t much study on the matter and I am more confused every minute.","Doctor":"Hi, I have gone through your question and understand your concerns. Arnold-Chiari malformation if symptomatic, is treated by surgery.Surgery consists on decompression of posterior fossa, i.e. removing a part of bone in your back part of your head, cutting and releasing outer and, in certain cases, middle coverings of the brain ( dura and arachnoid), putting a graft on it, relieving in this manner cerebellum ( small brain) and brainstem.It is a brain surgery and these types of operations carry risks also.Risks include cerebrospinal fluid leakage, wound infection, recurring of Arnold-Chiari malformation, rarely brain structures damage.Hope this answers your question.

Lightheadedness causes are many, but the most common ones are heart conditions like an arrythmia, anemia, low blood sugar, postural hypotension, dehydration and some times even vertebrobasilar insufficiency. As you said the cardiologists have exluded heart disease, but i would suggest to have also a rrythm holter and blood pressure holter. These  two examinations lasts 24 hours to 7days, checking the parameters i mentionedd above. You should have a blood study regarding cell counting and also blood sugar and hepatic and renal functioning tests. Vertebrobasilar insufficiency can present with dizziness (vertigo, balance impairement or headedness) and also weakness in the legs when it progresses, to diagnose this condition you should undergo a MRA. Sometimes lightheadedness is caused by stress or anxiety.  Also this symptom is common in people that play wind instruments.

This occurs due to contamination of food and water. The neurocysticercus is an organism that occurs in 4 stages and the cystic stage is the one that causes most seizures. Since your has has the calcified stage, it is a healed stage and less likely to cause seizures.However the fact that he had a seizure since 6 years means that the granuloma might be causing sudden outbursts of electrical activity. Seizures happen due to sudden out bursts of electrical activity in the brain and that can happen due to the old calcified granuloma or any new granuloma.Since CT scan is already done then proceed with an electroencephalogram to study the focus of abnormal electrical activity in his brain. Once the tests are done, he can be treated with anti epileptic medications for months and also he might need a dose of anti helminthic should there be any active neurocysticercosis lesion.If there is brain swelling then measures are to be taken to reduce it. He must avoid driving, swimming, cooking over fire and working with heavy machinery requiring high degree of alertness till his doctor allows him. Also make a note of any seizure attacks he gets in the next few days. This might happen and must be told to the doctor to give proper dose of medicine.If it is fully calcified then the infection is inactive. Repeat scan might be required to know recent activity. A single granuloma can be cured and might take months to years. If no seizure for 5 years then it is understood to be cored. He can eat non veg that is cooked properly in pressure cooker. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I was drinking a glass of water when I had a blockage due to air being trapped then I passed out and my husband said I was shaking as if I was having a fit.

My heart feels like if it beating a lil fast and not too long ago while I was in bed I felt like I couldn t move, or open my mouth to talk as if I had a very mini stroke it seizure. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.In your case the possibility of a seizure or evolving stroke needs to be evaluated.Dizziness can be due to many reasons and can happen due to decreased blood flow from heart to brain. When it happens, the blood flowing through the vessels from heart to brain might have a reduced flow. These are by the carotid and vertebral arteries on either sides. This can also happen due to momentary reduction in blood flow through the carotid arteries due to the pressure of a cervical rib or degenerative changes in the cervical spine, when you look up, down or turn your head.A clinical examination by the neurologist is essential to know the investigations to be further done for you. While bony cervical ribs or degenerative changes in cervical spine can be seen on X ray,  a brain scan and other investigations to study the flow of blood to the brain might also be required as a part of evaluation.Dizziness can also occur due to problems in the inner ear and balance mechanism of the body."},{"Patient":"Helo doctor, five months ago our car accident and at that time my forehead skull fractured.

Vitamin B12 deficiency, Iron deficiency anaemia may present with tremors in hands and weakness. Hyperthyroidism may also present with hand tremors. Get her blood tests done to rule out these medical conditions. Such tremors can occur due to anxiety. In anxiety individuals may develop tremors in hands, sweating, palpitations etc symptoms. She is more emotional than usual and this also strengthens anxiety as possibility. Unexplained tremors can occur due to some seizure discharge in brain also.

My muscles are sore throughout my body. Been having this for 7 years including 2 Carpal Tunnel operations as well as a neck operation. They also did a Risotomy procedure . Any ideas? I live on grandpa powders and pain killers.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It looks like you had rhizotomy procedure done for neck pain. In this procedure the selected nerve roots are blocked and this reduces the pain. As you have been having this neck pain for 7 years and now headache and tingling have also started therefore it will help to go back to your neurosurgeon and get a MRI scan of cervical spine done. This will show any new developments and disc changes that require attention and treatment so that your pain is treated. New procedures like laser assisted disc surgery and radiofrequency ablation are in use to release pressure over the pinched nerve roots and block the pain sensations in the area. These are well accepted by many patients and please discuss these treatments as you have already had a neck surgery without much relief in symptoms. Since it might be surgically difficult to decompress the nerves at various levels, doing radiofrequency ablation of nerve roots might be a better choice."},{"Patient":"Daughter, 35, been told, via two MRI s, she has mass on her brain which could be a scar due to a childhood fever or if not, is in such a position in brain (middle) that it is inoperable. Symptoms were headaches (which have subsided when cutting out caffeine cola) and occasional fuzzy vision. Currently, she will get MRI every three months to see if mass is growing. Can you tell me more about scaring on brain due to fever? How common? How high of fever would she have had to had for such to occur? As her mother, other than normal childhood stuff, ear infections, chicken pox (she was quite ill then), I can t remember a time of high fever. Just hoping of course the mass is a scar, but how is that determined for sure? If mass does not change, ever, obviously that would indicate a scar - right? Thanks for your help. Karli","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is important to see the MRI scan images to know the location and size of the mass. The doctor means to say that during childhood she might have had an illness causing inflammation of the brain. On recovery, the brain in the affected area might have formed a scar. This happens during healing. The tissue in the brain forms a scar. This is only a possibility.It will help to get serial MRI scans done and any growth in the mass to be observed. Since the doctor has mentioned it as a scan that means it  is showing benign features on imaging. Such a mass can cause problem by increasing the pressure of fluid inside the brain. Also its location makes it inoperable. Therefore if there is further growth and block to the flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain then a shunt might have to be placed to regulate the brain pressure and this will also treat symptoms like headache which is present due to the mass or scar.To confirm that the mass is a scar, additional MRI techniques might be used  like MR spectroscopy which will tell the chemical composition of the mass by studying the molecular composition in the scar region."},{"Patient":"I have an uncle in hospital he is in a comma he has been for about a month.

Do u think he will make it or even have a change ??","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.If your uncle is being taken care of by the nurses and doctors then better to allow him to stay at once place. However if the facility is causing him to worsen then better to shift him out but before shifting have a consultation with doctors and be sure the other hospital has better facilities and is well equipped in case of an emergency. Brain swelling or edema is a condition when there is water accumulation in the brain. This can happen when there is an infection or inflammation in the brain. Anti edema measures are started but in some patients brain swelling takes time to respond to medications. It is important to know how much is the coma score of your uncle. The coma score is based on an international scale and graded from 3/15 for a patient who is dead to 15/15 for a normal person. If the coma score is more than 7/15 then it is likely that your uncle might make a recovery. Please discuss this score with nurses and doctors.

However, it may be years before someone becomes significantly disabled. Your husband might be having a slower course of the condition and his life can be prolonged. The patients having this problem can have frequent trauma due to falls. Supportive care with gait-assisting devices is especially important to minimize falls. Since your husband has urinary tract infection, he needs to get treated for it completely. It is suggested that in consultation with urologist he gets urine investigations done regularly and take antibiotics at a low maintenance dose  as recommended. Catheter hygiene must be maintained. The sleeping cannot be controlled and medications that work on the brain in this condition have shown mild response.

Most humans start feeling fatigue if concentrating hard and trying to remember things at an elderly age. This is because there is a lot of information already being processed in your brain and further addition of knowledge might reduce the information processing time just as in a computer.

I have been experiencing progressive numbness of both of my feet, beginning with the right foot, over approximately 5 year period and now it seemes to have progressed to my right hand. I have also been experiencing vertigo, imbalance, and memory loss. About 3 months ago I had severe pain from my right hand, up my right arm and then over the shoulder and down to the end of the scapula area. An MRI of the cervical area showed herniations of the cervical discs and a rupture at c6-7. A recent Mri of the brain, for diagnosis for the above symptoms of vertigo, imbalance, memory loss, some ataxia, changing vision condition, showed an increased T2 and FLAIR signal present in the supratentorial white matter that likely represents mild chronic microvascular ischemia.

I'm having a really difficult time trying to find doctors that want to help me because of the multiple areas of my medical problems. The neurologist that ordered the MRI of my brain won't even call me back. Can someone please help me?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Your neck, shoulder and arm problems are due to the cervical nerve roots being pinched at multiple levels as seen on cervical spine disc herniations. The C 6 - C 7 disc rupture is significant and might cause limitation of neck movements.The MRI brain shows areas of T 2 hyperintensity in the supratentorial white matter. Since you have not mentioned your age and the images are not attached, it is bit difficult to confirm if the findings can be acceptable at your age. Micro vascular ischemia is a term for loss of blood flow through the small blood vessels in brain leading to decreased oxygenation and tissue damage, these changes can also occur in people with diabetes and hypertension. Autoimmune conditions can also show certain features but your MRI does not fit in to a single category. MS will show a definite pattern on MRI and I think your doctor has ruled out this condition by clinical features and MRI scan findings."},{"Patient":"Hi am having stomach pain under my breast that is upper abdominal area.

This is especially more when doing activities that involve movements of the neck. It is likely a change that has developed during the healing process. There are many small ligaments and joints in the region of surgery and after surgery the area heals and might cause popping sounds. As pain is not there, it is not due to pinching of nerve roots or failure of surgery. Many people experience these popping sounds and with time it gets lesser. Please avoid doing heavy physical activities involving your spine. If at any time there is development of pain then please consult your doctor and you might require a MRI scan cervical spine after clinical examination.

And sometimes when I get horrible sinus headaches, my arms will go completly numb. But this time, it was just my right thumb. It is swelling and I can t feel anything but pressure, what do I do?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The thumb is supplied by branches of the median nerve in the palmar area and radial nerve dorsally. The nerves originate in the neck region and then the nerve roots join to form nerves that again branch and supply the smaller areas. Since there is swelling also, an inflammation of the small muscles in the hand might be a cause. This happens more in those doing activities requiring over use of thumb and fingers as in musicians and those working on the computer. If you are among those who use your thumb and fingers frequently at your job then please take rest from work every 30 minutes and do hand relaxation exercises.If there is no overuse of fingers then you should consult a neurologist and get conically examined.  Therefore if your numbness in in the thumb and arms then a nerve conduction study on the region might help. If required and MRI of cervical spine might help understand your problem. Use anti inflammatory and muscle relaxants for a sore thumb. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"My daughter has been suffering from reflex anoxic seizures from when she was 4 months. Now she is one.

In medical leterature, reflex anoxic seizures are paroxysmal, spontaneously-reversing brief episodes of asystole triggered by pain, fear or anxiety. Anoxic seizures are non-epileptic events caused by a reflex asystole due to increased vagal responsiveness.Following are symptoms of reflex anoxic seizures1. During the episode, the child becomes suddenly pale and limp, will fall if standing, and loses consciousness.2. This is followed by stiffening and clonic jerking of the limbs.3. The episode is usually brief (30-60 seconds) and recovery is rapid.4. There may also be upward eye deviation and urinary incontinence.5. On recovery, the child may feel tired for some time.6. Reflex anoxic seizures do not cause tongue-biting and this may be useful in the differentiation from epilepsyThe above symptoms might indicate a likely reflex anoxic seizure.Whether your child has the above symptoms she must be seen by the pediatrician to confirm another diagnosis like epilepsy or causes of fainting involving the heart or brain."},{"Patient":"I have a sister that has spells, that seem as if she is drunk. she says she hasn t been drinking although its hard to believe. she stairs blankly sometimes, but most times she has slurred speech & has a hard time completing a thought. she also repeats herself over & over.

Though the pressure on nerve roots at strategic locations seems to be relieved by doing surgical procedure, the patient might often complain severe neck pain even after surgery. The reason is that the affected nerve roots are still under pressure in areas other than where surgical manipulation has been done.You can choose to get repeat surgery done but that also has limitations after a fusion surgery. Please discuss non surgical procedures like radio frequency techniques and targeted nerve root block. These are temporary procedures and might need repeat sessions every year. Please encourage your husband by telling him that there are many people having pain even after surgery like the one he has got done.

In the absence of continuous pain this is not a serious concern. In some people the superficial temporal artery gets prominent with age and then the pulsations can be transmitted by placing a finger over the skin and this is felt. However since you do feel pain at times, it will help to consult a doctor and confirm that there is no underlying medical condition that is progressing or requires treatment. It is difficult to pin point the cause just going by symptoms but a clinical examination can surely help to narrow the diagnosis if any. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hi.

This can cause symptoms of bilateral hand and feet tingling. Since the neurologist has examined you, it will help if you get the nerve conduction study. This is because some nerves can get damages and in early stages cause symptoms like tingling. By doing nerve conduction tests, the functioning of nerves will be evaluated and any suspicion confirmed. This might be followed by MRI scan of brain and spinal cord to seen any signs of disease in your system. Since you have written that it is a repeat condition, it will help to discuss your previous medical records and any treatment given at that time.

A small chronic lacunar infarct in the left thalamus is observed. There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction in the brain parenchyma. There is a mildly prominent CSF overlying the cerebral hemispheres secondary to moderate generalized cerebral and cerebellar volume loss rathat than subdural hygromas. The ventricles and basilar cisterns are normal in size.","Doctor":"Lacunar infarctions are ischemic brain lesions less than 1cm in diameter. The first one described is not sure to be a infarction as it can also be a dilated perivascular space, witch can be be a variation of normal anatomy or changes through a persons life. I don't understand well the sentence before the last, but i suppose it's a brain atrophy caused by an old subdural hemorrhage. You should see a neurologist to value the risk factors for cerebral vascular disease and to treat the patient properly."},{"Patient":"Hi. I have had stenosis at c6-7 for decades. I have lived with the symptoms, including a couple of hospitalizations for acute radiculopathy. My recent MRI showed severe foraminal stenosis at C4 with compromised exit nerves. This was surprising as this level was fine seven years ago when I had the last MRI. Could this explain the severe pain of unknown origin along the lower edge of my rib cage. This has been an issue for years. Even morphine doesn t lessen the pain. Also, I read somewhere that it could cause skin eruptions. Is this so?","Doctor":"Hello. I have been through your question and understand your concern.The foraminal narrowing at C4 level may be due to cervical stenosis, because it is though that stenosis causes some force mis spread in the posterior columns which are the foraminas.The lower rib pain is not explained by these finding though. You should have a thoracic MRI to better evaluate the foraminas at those levels. Skin eruptions are associated with Herpes Zoster Virus infection and does not persist for years.Hope this helps.Wish you the best health"},{"Patient":"Hello, I am a 47 year old male and I am experiencing an intermittent sharp pain above my right ear in conjunction with a sensitive scalp that feels sore to the touch.

The tremor has become worse and I have constant forearm pain. In the last couple of months I have noticed that my left hand is starting to tremor. In addition my wife says that my body jerks while I am sitting lots of times I don t notice it. Should I see my doctor or can a cervical stenosis cause these symptoms.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The spine is made up of an alignment of small bones. These bones have sponge like discs between them and the spinal cord passes along the back of these bones through the spinal canal. Cervical stenosis is a term used to describe a condition in which there is narrowing of the space through which the spinal cord passes.  There might be pressure on the discs in the cervical spine and this is causing slight pressure on the spinal canal at a particular level and causing pinching of nerve roots leading to severe pain in the area supplied by the nerve. The disc problem which was present at one level might have progressed and affected the discs at other levels also.Right now you require a repeat MRI scan of the cervical spine and this will tell any significant changes that have taken place in two years. It is possible that you need urgent medical attention and this needs to be discussed with your doctor and treatment to be taken.There are many treatment options available. Initially patients are treated for the pain and discomfort by medication and physiotherapy. If the condition has progressed to non responsive to medication then surgical techniques including laser surgery and radiofrequency ablation methods can help you get relief. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I have a thoracic back injury that I haven t recovered from. I got my last set of intravertebral injections on Oct 22. The last 3 weeks my pain has been getting worse. Last night I found an indentation, if you will, around T4-T5. I m still working part time and finished only a two day consecutive schedule and I m in so much pain. Could the indentation(divet) in my back(soft tissue) be from a possible side effect of the injections?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.You might have had a severe back injury. Since you have found an indentation at T 4 - T 5 then you should get clinically examined and if required X rays and CT scan or MRI scan of the thoracic spine is to be done. This will show the exact nature of injury. There are discs between bones in the spine and it is important to know if your bones have reduced in height due to fracture after the injury and if the disc is bulging posteriorly and causing an indentation on the covering of spinal cord. If the disc is significantly causing obliteration of lateral recess and neural foramina compromise then the pain since 3 weeks might be due to this. Other than injections you can discuss treatments like radiofrequency ablation and nerve block. If there is severe disc problem then surgery might help. For the vertebra if there is a fracture and collapse where you find the indentation then vertebroplasty can be doe to restore the height of vertebra. Detailed discussion with your doctor is important. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I woke up in the middle of the night with a pain similar to menstrual cramping in my lower abdomen.

However you are right is saying that the side effects of primidone are more difficult to manage than the tremor itself. Studies have been done concerning giving primidone in Parkinsons and it is seen that mean tremor amplitudes were not changed by primidone. Also Tremor frequency was unaltered by the medication. Many doctors say that long-acting propranolol is an useful adjuvant therapy for the tremors associated with Parkinson's disease. However medications are to be changed after asking your doctor. If you feel comfortable and tremors are slight then you can stop primidone and wait for your parkinsons specialist for a more suitable medication to treat your tremors.

In the lumbar region there are 5 bones called vertebrae numbered from L 1 to L 5. After L 5 there is S 1. S 1 to S 5 are sacral segments and fused together. Between any two bones till the level of L 5 - S 1 there are small discs which are cushion like structures to allow movement in all directions. The discs are between the ends of two bone called end plates and fills the space between the end plates. There are small foramina between any two bones at the disc level through which nerve roots originating in the spinal cord pass through. In your case the opposing end plates of L 5 and S 1 vertebrae have developed mild age related changes. The disc at this level is also showing an annular displacement to the left side which is also seen to displace the nerve root. However the nerve root is not under compression.Your imaging findings indicate a mild form of lower back disc problem and can be treated with pain relief medications and physiotherapy.

All results were normal. What could be the reason behind such repeated episodes of dizziness? Note: such symptons appear once or twice a week and less when I am relaxed.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Dizziness can also occur due to stress related anxiety or overflow of emotions. However before saying that your symptoms are due to anxiety, the following other causes of dizziness and nausea must be evaluated.Short duration of dizziness can also happen due to decreased blood flow from heart to brain. When it happens, the blood flowing through the vessels from heart to brain might have a reduced flow. These are by the carotid and vertebral arteries on either sides. This is more significant when you are standing upright and doing any moderate to heavy physical activity. You might require a CT scan or MRI scan of the brain.The best way to analyze if the reduced blood flow to the brain is causing your dizziness is by doing a carotid and vertebral arteries Doppler ultrasound. It will show the flow of blood from the heart to the brain and if it is adequate.Clinical examination of inner ear and vestibular system in the ear is also required. For this you might have to consult the ENT specialist. After clinical examination if there is suspicion of inner ear problems then detailed investigation is required. It might help to do a Electronystagmography (ENG) or videonystagmography (VNG) done to record abnormal eye movements while the head is placed in different positions or your balance organs are stimulated with water or air."},{"Patient":"My medical history over the past few months has been kind of rocky, but the main thing I am concerned about is a finding on an MRI done on my brain. The results say a pineal cyst measuring 4.4x10.5 mm was found with no other abnormalities. My appointment with the neurologist is not until the third. I believe it to be symptomatic. Can you share any knowledge with me about what symptoms these can cause and if it could relate to my dizziness and heavy feeling throughout my legs? Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The MRI brain scan shows a pineal cyst of size 4.4 x 10.5 mm and is small to cause any symptoms. I assure you that a pineal cyst of that size is unlikely to be causing your symptoms. You can have a detailed discussion on that with your neurologist during appointment.In medical literature, there have been less than 50 patients with symptomatic pineal cysts till date. Most of these patients had history of headaches and symptoms concerning vision. Symptoms occur usually when the cyst causes obstruction to the flow of brain fluid causing hydrocephalus. Unless your MRI scan shows features of hydrocephalus due to CSF obstruction, it is difficult to say that your pineal cyst is symptomatic.Causes of your dizziness can include reduced blood supply to the brain, vertigo and anxiety. Please do not worry for the pineal cyst."},{"Patient":"I m having a tingling sensation in my left calf and foot especially when I walk or after exercise.

A nerve test a couple of months ago showed the tingling was coming from my spine and I did physcial therapy for a few treatments and it seemed to help, but the pain and tingling is back more than before. It doesn t bother me when I m sitting or sleeping just when I walk and exercise.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The nerves of the lower back, calf and foot originate in the spine. The nerves arise from nerve roots which then combine in different permutations and then form a nerve that transmits nerve impulses. Since your nerve conduction studies have shown that the tingling is coming from the spine, it is possible that there is problems involving discs in the lower back at single or multiple levels and this disc displacement is causing pressure over the nerve roots. When a particular nerve supplying an area like calf and foot is compressed at the roots, then the patient experiences tingling and pain which appears to be involving the areas supplied by that nerve. This is what is happening to you. It will help to get a MRI scan of lower back and then discuss the areas of possible nerve root compression with your doctor. Physical therapy helps in most patients with mild tingling and pain. Some patients also require nerve pain relievers for treatment. During sitting or sleeping the nerve roots are not irritated and therefore you do not feel the symptoms. You can go for colonoscopy which is due in 3 days. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I have had chronic lower back pain for years. An X-Ray showed my sacrum is fusing together with my spine (as the Dr said). I have since noticed over the last couple of months a lump probably a couple of cms in circumference to the right side just at the side of my spine which is causing me terrible pain. Should I be worried?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It appears that you have developed complication of chronic lower back condition. You might have had advanced degenerative changes in your lower back involving the sacral segments and lumbar spine which has been there for many years. This is a possibility that this degenerative change has progressed since and has developed in to changes like a degenerative cyst in the region. As you report a lump in the right side of your spine, it will help is a detailed investigation like MRI spine is done and discussed with your doctor. The degenerative cysts can cause a lot of pressure on the nerve roots in the region leading to pain and discomfort. Treatment is guided with the intention of removing any pressure on the affected nerve roots and decompressing the nerve. Non surgical methods of treatment can work if there is mild pressure on the nerve roots.

This is known as radiculopathy. It happens due to nerve root irritation due to slight movements including when you are doing active physical movements. This causes pressure on nerves roots and pinching of the nerves. This is followed by sudden shooting pain from the lower back to the hip and can also be experienced behind the knee. Your doctor wants to know the exact details of nerve pinching should it have occurred in your lower back region. This will help guide your treatment. If you feel severe pain then apply a little ointment containing pain reliever and muscle relaxant. Please discuss treatment available for degenerative cervical disc disease with your doctor and if it is a serious concern.

There are nerves having branches that innervate the skin in the head and neck region including the back of the ear. Once such nerve is the trigeminal nerve. It arises from the brain stem and then goes to a relay center called ganglion. From there the nerves branch out to supply different areas.

My doctors has given me vertin 8 mg and as soon as I take it ,my discomfort does reduce. What exactly is my problem.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Our brain has an inbuilt balance mechanism by which we adjust our balance with change in posture. This is done by the cerebellum and the inner ear mechanism. The cerebellum is the small brain and controls the balance and gait centers. The inner ear has the vestibular system that gathers the information regarding change in posture and relays it to the brain. The information in the inner ear is transmitted by the hair cells and endolymph in the inner ear. There are conditions when these hair cells do not function properly with change in position and are unable to send the right information to the brain. This leads to a confusion of the brain in processing the change in position and adapting to it. The result is dizziness and vertigo. It might help to get detailed investigation done under guidance of your doctor. Vertin is a medication that helps send the correct information to the brain and prevent dizziness. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"my husband is suffering from neurocysticercosis.Seven years befre he suffered a scissor attack.Today again he had the same attack in the morning.The granular cysticercoma is calcified in the frontal lobe left side.kindly suggest me what is to be done now.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Neuricysticercosis is infection of the brain by the dog tape worm. This occurs due to contamination of food and water. The neurocysticercus is an organism that occurs in 4 stages and the cystic stage is the one that causes most seizures. Since your husband has the calcified stage, it is a healed stage and less likely to cause seizures. However the fact that he had a seizure after 7 years means that he should undergo certain tests to know the present condition. Seizures happen due to sudden out bursts of electrical activity in the brain and that can happen due to the old calcified granuloma or any new granuloma. Other conditions can also cause a seizure. Therefore it will first be important to do a CT scan or MRI scan brain and then proceed with an electroencephalogram to study the focus of abnormal electrical activity in his brain. Once the tests are done, he can be treated with anti epileptic medications for months and also he might need a dose of anti helminthic should there be any active neurocysticercosis lesion. If there is brain swelling then measures are to be taken to reduce it. He must avoid driving, swimming, cooking over fire and working with heavy machinery requiring high degree of alertness till his doctor allows him. Also make a note of any seizure attacks he gets in the next few days. This might happen and must be told to the doctor to give proper dose of medicine.

Please consult a neurologist and get a complete neurological examination done. Investigations like MRI scan brain and spinal cord might also be required for you.The symptoms can rarely also be due to stress involved in your daily life.

Your best medically idea would be?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.There are causes other than heart attack and stroke that might cause a sudden passing out. Please find the conditions as follows.1. Vasovagal syncope. This is a condition when due to the stimulation of the vagal nerve and due to over activity, there can arise a shock like state when the patient becomes suddenly unresponsive.2. Hypoglycemia. This happens due to subnormal amount of glucose circulating in the blood. This causes insufficient nutrition to the organs including the brain and can cause sudden collapse.3. A sudden generalized seizure. This happens when there is sudden outburst of electrical activity in the brain and this leads to a severe epileptic seizure from which the patient might take time to make a recovery.4. Electrolyte imbalances like low sodium or potassium states which give rise to sudden cessation of alertness and awareness.5. Bleeding from any organ inside the body that is not visible from outside. The patient goes in to a state of hemorrhagic shock. Some bleeding cases can be self contained but the rapid loss of blood causes sudden loss of consciousness.6. Sudden attacks of apnea due to sleep or even during the day can cause a confusion state and the inability to keep awake due to reduced supply of oxygen to the brain. Please discuss the above possibilities and any reason that might have been pre existent and was not known earlier."},{"Patient":"I fell in the shower heavily landed on my bottom. I was stunt shocked and could not do anything or speak for good five minutes. I managed to crawl and kneel with terrible pain and gradually managed to stand up. This happened about two months ago. One xray did not revealed anything and still waiting for the 2nd rray results. I have been taking codamol and recently experienced dizziness when getting up or bend down to tie laces etc. Please advice me for I would be most grateful Joe","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Since you had a fall in the shower two months back, it is important to evaluate your problems in detail. The fact that you landed heavily on your bottom and were unreponsive for 5 minutes shows that the fall was of a moderate degree. If you are experiencing a dizziness even after two months means that your complete neurological examination is required. The dizziness that you experience is due to either something in the inner ear or in the brain itself. X ray as such is a less detailed investigation and I recommend that you consult the neurologist and get a CT scan brain or MRI scan brain done to make sure that it is not a serious condition in the brain which has remained since your fall two months back. Once it is sure that you do not have any serious concern in the brain then your inner ear needs to be tested for balance mechanism. This can happen due to labrynthitis or vertigo and medications are available to treat it after confirming the diagnosis."},{"Patient":"My MRI shows cord edema C3 through C6 and 5 spots on brain.

In my opinion your dizzy spells can be caused by a problem in your inner ear called  benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Have you had any head trauma? Are these spells provoked by head movement?I would recommend you to go to an ORL specialist, have a physical examination and a Dix Hallpike maneuver to rule out this diagnosis. Another possible cause of these dizzy spells could be vertigo epilepsy, a rare form of epilepsy. Dizzy spells in this situation would not be related to head movement.

It is possible that even after lesion removal, effects are persisting on the balance mechanism. The balance in human is carried by the cerebellum at the back of the brain and the inner ear which contains the vestibular apparatus. Also there are nerves arising from the brain stem that supplies these areas and integrates the information and maintains a body posture that helps in balance.

It is malignant and a glioblastoma with oligodendroglial component is most likely a malignant tumor for which chemotherapy is being given. It is a kind of cancer cell proliferation in the brain. Please share complete details like tumor size, location and pathological type if biopsy or surgery has been done. In many patients having a well differentiated glioblastoma, chemotheraphy and surgery gives good results. In patients with slightly higher grade, the treatment might also include radiation therapy, chemotherapy and surgery. Patient with lower grade glioblastoma can make a near normal recovery. However those with a higher grade need to be kept under close observation and pain relief.Since the primary tumor is in the brain, starting chemotherapy can shut down certain areas of brain and that is what has happened to your mother.

Between the bones we also have nerve roots originating in the spinal cord and passing through foramen between bones.You seem to be having discs at a particular level that is protruding between the bones and this protrusion is backwards and causing symptoms. There is also extra bone growth at that level leading to additional pressure on the nerve roots. It might also cause obliteration of lateral recess and neural foraminal compromise.

Memory is just one aspect of mental health and there are various forms of memory like remote memory and recent memory. There are also other areas like personality, attitude, mood and interpersonality profile that make you into a social person. There are psychological tests to understand what kind of mental inclination you have. There is a wide range of emotional and mental outlooks and you are certainly normal but might have to change your own outlook towards others. Understanding problems as complex conversations is a logical function and sometimes we are only lazy and do not want to involve ourselves in listening to others. Hearing and listening are different. Hearing is passive and listening is with concentration. So you might not be applying concentration when involving yourself in conversations and missing sentences what has been heard leading to the person your are with unable to communicate with you in an effective manner. All your problems can be solved if you consult a psychiatrist and do some higher mental function and psychological tests. A session or two with psychologist will also help you.

Other times, it feels my back is under water & is swaying side to side!!! Ruled out. Lazer I","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Your situation needs a more professional approach than taking out all the hardware inserted during surgery and replacing it with cadaver bone. The bone we have within us is a living tissue though it is  hard and stronger than other tissues. This is because of calcium deposition and there is regular exchange of minerals between the bone and other tissues. The bone also gets its blood supply and remains alive. Therefore please do not consider cadaver bone replacement for yourself.The problem with two cages and its displacement at operated site requires proper management. Back fusion surgeries might not provide a good level of pain relief in some patients. Though the pressure on nerve roots at strategic locations seems to be relieved by doing surgical procedure, the patient might often complain severe lower back pain even after surgery. This happens in about 20 to 40 percent of patients and the reason is that the affected nerve roots are still under pressure in areas other than where surgical manipulation has been done.If laser is not an option for you then please discuss new methods like radiofrequency ablation and how effective it will work for you. The problem for your extended suffering was the infection that unfortunately developed in the operated site. Now that it is cured, healing should occur fast.Wishing you the best for hip surgery."},{"Patient":"I always feel like there is water or fluid on the side of my head.

This might be due to irritation of nerves supplying the scalp. Water or fluid inside the brain is a normal feature and everyone has it. That water is much deeply located and will never communicate with the outside surface of brain. Also the brain is protected buy a strong skull and over that there is scalp skin. In this way it is not the water inside your head but some sort of discomfort arising due to nerve stimulation in head and face region. Please consult a doctor and get a neurological clinical examination done. This will help in arriving at a confirmed diagnosis. Doing a CT scan might be indicated depending on clinical findings and to see if there is any structural changes under the scalp causing that feeling.

Since the dent is slowly increasing in size over 2 years therefore it looks like a benign condition that is slowly progressing with time. It is important do do a CT scan and if required a MRI scan to know in complete detail the condition causing the dent in the skull. It is a concern as you have been neglecting it for 2 years and it might grow further with time and can become serious. There are many benign conditions like cysts and tumors which can slowly infiltrate the skull bone and underlying tissues.

Between the bones we also have nerve roots originating in the spinal cord and passing through foramen between bones.You seem to be having discs at  C 4 - C 5 level that is protruding between the bones and this protrusion is backwards and causing symptoms. There is also extra bone growth at that level leading to additional pressure on the nerve roots on left side. It might also cause obliteration of lateral recess and neural foraminal compromise. This is leading to pinching of nerves causing severe pain.You require to be examined a neurologist and a MRI of the cervical spine if indicated to know if the nerve are under pressure and the location.There are patients who get relief by doing physiotherapy and taking neurogenic pain relievers. Injections are also given for relief. However this might not always happen. If your pain is severe and not responding to medical treatment then the disc protrusion needs to be removed by doing a small surgery at the cervical neck region. Presently, laser assisted surgical techniques are also available.Wish you a quick recovery. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I was comparing 2 of my mris. 1 from years ago states that my chiari malformation was low lying and 1cm below a line drawn between the basion and opisthion.My most recent mri states the tonsils are very low lying and extend to the superior margin of the c1 elements. Since the 2 mris were done by different measuring standards, I cannot tell if the condition has progressed. Can you tell me if the 2 mri shows progression? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Chiari malformation is a congenital condition affecting the cerebellar tonsils and upper portion of spinal cord. In the first MRI there is a technical comment saying that the cerebellar tonsils are below 1 cm to a line drawn across from the basion to opisthion. In the second report there is mention of extension till the level of C 1. In such a situation, it will be better to see the images once again and draw a common reference for the distance of the tonsil to the line between basion and opisthion in both MRI scans and make a comparative conclusion. If you can make arrangements to send in both your scan (mid sagittal section) image then I will do it and give a detailed report on your progression of condition if any.

Diabetes itself starts affecting the nerves, eyes and kidneys in all patients having the condition for years. It is possible that you are experiencing the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy.Possibility of Vitamin B 12 deficiency must also be considered. In those taking oral glucose lowering medications like metformin, there is malabsorption of Vitamin B 12 from the intestines. This can cause a chronic deficiency state and leads to symptoms like numbness and tingling in arms and feet.Please get examined by your doctor regularly and take Vitamin B 12 supplement.

From 8 months I am having some dizzy feeling in my head. For 2 months it was just some dizziness. Then I consulted a doctor and he gave me a neck collar. I used it for 2 weeks and found that whenever I move my neck it feels as if neck skin is stretched. And neck feels stiff. And many times when I move my neck a certain cracking sound comes. And one more thing sir. In previous 8 months l have had around 4 episodes of around 5 seconds during night where I got up from bed due to a certain sudden spinning in my head . that is very horrible experience. And I have the feeling that it may always happen again. I have to change my sides during night to averse this spinning attack. Please help me out.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Moments of dizziness can happen due to decreased blood flow from heart to brain. When it happens, the blood flowing through the vessels from heart to brain might have a reduced flow. These are by the carotid and vertebral arteries on either sides. This is more significant when you are standing upright and doing any moderate to heavy physical activity. You might require a CT scan or MRI scan of the brain.The best way to analyze if the reduced blood flow to the brain is causing your dizziness is by doing a carotid and vertebral arteries Doppler ultrasound. It will show the flow of blood from the heart to the brain and if it is adequate.Clinical examination of inner ear and vestibular system in the ear is also required.It might help to do a Electronystagmography (ENG) or videonystagmography (VNG) done to record abnormal eye movements while the head is placed in different positions or your balance organs are stimulated with water or air. For this you might have to consult the ENT specialist.Dizziness can also occur due to stress related anxiety or overflow of emotions."},{"Patient":"I received an email from my workplace today stating that an employee in my organization had potential exposure to a form of meningitis.

Meningitis is an infection of the meninges. There can be many causes of meningitis like bacterial, tuberculous, viral and fungal. It is due to the infection entering the blood stream of a person and then spreading to the covering of the brain. This is usually not infectious and you are safe in your workplace. Even considering that you have a weak immune system and living around your sisters kids, there is no additional risk of meningitis just because another lady was found to have meningitis in another floor of your office.

She didn t tell me at the time.She s generally very active, cuts her own grass, maintains the house (she lives by herself), things like that. She s also very healthy, takes no medication, and is self-sufficient. I talk with her every day, and a few times a week I visit and have breakfast or dinner with her. She forgets what she is talking about and must tell her repeatedly about current events, none of which she remembers. Could she have had a stroke? At some point, I will bring her to live with me, but she won t discuss it yet. She is VERY reluctant to seek medical treatment...she even hates taking the occasional motrin.","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern.From your description your mother seems to show manifestations of dementia. Dementia can have many causes, stroke being one of them, however the most common one and also compatible with your mothers symptoms is Alzheimer's disease.Naturally some other potential causes must be excluded through tests such as brain imaging to exclude stroke or tumor and some blood tests such as blood count, glucose, liver and kidney function tests, electrolytes, thyroid function tests, Vitamin B12 levels. If after the tests and medical evaluation the diagnosis will remain Alzheimers there are some available treatments to slow down its progression but unfortunately not to halt it altogether, only slow it down.

This all started shortly after my child was born. I thought it was just after birth symptoms. After a while I got diagnosed with anxiety disorder. My doctor rarely takes me seriously. I feel like it is because of my mental status. However I know the difference between a anxiety/panic attack, and when something else is wrong. No to mention over time these symptoms have grown worse, and more frequent. I also notice Also my meds almost completely stop them from happening. I have been a lot better while on them.

Thanks Alora","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to HCM and thanks for providing detailed history.I can understand your problem. A lot of females develop symptoms of anxiety and mild depression following childbirth. In most of females these symptoms improve by own but in some they may persist in form of anxiety, restlessness or depression. The symptoms like random pains in different spots, breathing difficulties during exercise, sweating, feeling of sickness and fainting etc could occur due to anxiety but before making anxiety as diagnosis we should rule out medical causes like hyperthyroidism, hypoglycaemia etc. In hyperthyroidism such symptoms can occur so first of all you should get your thyroid levels checked to rule out hyperthyroidism.If medical causes are ruled out then anxiety is most likely the cause of your symptoms. You are taking Lamotrigine and Sertraline already and as per my opinion these are right drugs for your symptoms, but these symptoms are persisting so either the doses of drugs should be increased or the medicines should be changes. SNRI medicines like Venlafaxine can prove useful for your somatic pain conditions and can be replaced with Sertraline. Apart from this pregabalin can be added for pains and ill also reduce the anxiety. Discuss with your psychiatrist for prescription of these drugs.Thanks, hope this helps you.

When I was 11 my head got smashed against a brick wall, and ever since my face, hand ( I think it was my left side), goes numb, get a headache, blurred vision, see double and I can only see in front of me not the sides of my eyes. I can t function I take pain pills and go to sleep. I got this all the time, it has gotton less and less but I want to know what this is.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Symptoms such as numbness, headache, blurred vision and double vision should be investigated in detail. If you had an injury to the left side of your face then certain nerve injury might be suspected. However, for the eyes, getting examined by the ophthalmologist is essential. You should not ignore the problem with eyes. There are small muscles around the eyes and these help in moving the eyes in a particular direction so that you can see properly. These small muscles are supplied by specific nerves and damage to these nerves can cause problems like blurred vision or double vision. Clinical tests have to be done to make certain any problems with the nerves. Since you also complain of headaches and numbness therefore a clinical neurological examination is also suggested. After examining your your doctor might ask tests which might include CT scan of MRI scan of brain and orbits which will show details of the eyes also. Treatment depends on clinical findings. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I was diagnosed with cushings disease 2 yrs ago, small tumour was removed from my brain, lately I have been feeling tired, sluggish, light-headed,headache, nausea, endocrinologist states my labs are ok, cortisol levels fine. symptoms began after I took flu shot 3 weeks ago. doctor tells me to take gingerale, and Tylenol. second day home from work, have to go to work tomorrow, concerned.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.If you have made a complete recovery after surgery for the brain tumor 2 years back then it is most likely that there is some other reason for your tiredness and headaches. However, if your have not got regular follow up done for your brain surgery then please get checked up once.The tiredness and headache is most likely due to a mild infection if the symptoms have been there for a couple of days. It can be due to common viral infections. Some people also get flu like symptoms after taking flu shot but this usually happens within a week of the shot and you have taken your injection 3 weeks back.Weather changes and seasonal allergy can also be causing symptoms and that can also be due to infections in throat. Please do gargling as suggested by your doctor and protect yourself from extremes of weather conditions."},{"Patient":"I have had a great recovery thus far. Took my twin girls out yesterday afternoon and had to lift the double stroller into my SUV. I literally forgot that I even had surgery and just tried to pick it up. It was super heavy and I barely got it in. Last night I woke up to pains in my left abdomen above my scar and today it is noticeably bigger. Is this something I should be concerned with? I do not go back to the doctor for 11 days and am afraid it could be something serious.","Doctor":"HIThank for asking to HCMI can understand your concern the great care has to be taken while lifting a heavy weight if you have surgical scar on your abdomen, this could cause incisional hernia, better avoid lifting heavy weight, hope this information helps you have good day."},{"Patient":"I have slight tingling on my face. My forhead is feeling different I keep touching it. My eyes feel like they are part of it had a head injury about 6 days ago but no trouble It was light and I never lost consciousness or displayed signs of concussion. right by my left eybrow close to my temple, the doctor put dermabond. The head is close to healed so I don t htink it is connected","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The nerve supply to the face is through divisions of the same nerve. Therefore getting injury in one area can cause tingling in another part. That is why the injury near the temple can be cause for tingling in forehead.The nerves originate in the brain and divide in to 3 branches, they supply the skin over face and forehead region. An injury in one region will cause build up of chemical  transmitters which carry information on pain and strange sensations like numbness and tingling. When the wound is healing and the nerves also heal then the tingling like sensations appear. Since the nerve branches come together in the brain therefore the sensations from one nerve branch might appear as coming from another branch."},{"Patient":"My Daughter is getting these Twitches or glitches thats what she call them, today she had them for about 20min on the school bus, she dorpped her phone and was unable to walk for a little while.

Can some one please advise on what this maybe? I dont think there seizures, Thanks","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is possible that your daughter experienced a partial complex seizure. This is not the complete seizure like episode that people call fits but a minor form. However, if this has been happening since earlier, it should be investigated in detail. Taking blood pressure and doing blood tests might be normal but this requires detailed clinical examination on guidelines of epilepsy and seizure. Please take an appointment from a neurologist or epilepsy clinic and get her examined in detail.She might require investigations like CT scan or MRI scan brain and electroencephalography to tell where exactly the problem might be in her brain. These episodes occur due to changes in the electrical activity in the brain and when the brain gets excited and starts discharging impulses which are not in a normal pattern."},{"Patient":"Hi there, I had an aneurysm procedure done on 15//08/14.is it normal to still experience the same symptoms almost 3 months later?

I do take my medication religiously.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is possible that after an aneurysm procedure, you might continue to experience slight pain and discomfort. However, having same symptoms or severe pain requires you to get an opinion from the operating surgeon. It is important to know complete details of aneurysm treatment and if there was any placement of stent in the aneurysm. Pre existing conditions involving the spine and intervertebral discs should also be considered when looking for a cause leading to severe pain.The site of aneurysm is also important to be evaluated for any significant changes after the procedure. Though rare in occurrence, aneurysms might continue to grow even after a procedure has been done. Please call for your surgeons attention during the next visit."},{"Patient":"I just had a temporal lobectomy done about five days ago. My doctor told me to lay low and take it easy for about a month to three months because he doesn t want bleeding or pressure in my head. I assume this means I can not have sex for that amount of time. Am I atleast able to masterbate? When can I have sex?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Having a temporal lobectomy is a major procedure and you must avoid situations causing increased pressure in your brain. Sex is an intense physical activity and can cause raised blood pressure and more blood flow t the brain causing problems to healing. It is best to avoid sex for 6 weeks and then slowly start having sex with least discomfort. Masturbation also causes the similar effects on the brain and can be hazardous at the moment. Please wait a month before you masturbate. Sex and masturbation should be slow and without force in the beginning. You can use lot of lubrication jelly and remind your partner to be gentle. It does not mean you cannot express your sexual desires for a month. Please use this period to create an emotional bond with your partner and to get closer and this will help you recover quick."},{"Patient":"I fell hiking last friday and hit the whole side of my head on a rock.

This can cause irritation of nerve endings which can get sensitized when brushing your hair. If you experience symptoms like persistent headaches, heaviness, vomiting, dizziness, loss of gait then please get back to your doctor at once for a CT scan brain to know if there is any injury to brain which is not visible from outside.Also check your scalp for any bruises and injury and signs of inflammation and infection in the scalp that might have appeared after the injury. If present you must apply antibiotic ointment containing sodium fusidate to the area.

I m feeling panicy and worried as it doesn t respond to ibuprofen, thank you","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.As you have been having a constant neck tension for years, therefore it appears to be a chronic problem and less likely to be associated with a brain tumor. At times, during excessive coughing as you had from phayrngitis, there can be small muscle spasms or conditions within the head to cause pain in the head. This might happen due to irritation of nerves in the region. This can also be related to the balance mechanism if you find that there is some amount of discomfort when changing positions from standing to sitting. Please get a complete neurological examination done. For peace of mind you can get a CT scan brain done to confirm that there is no concern in the brain. Please avoid making sudden head and neck movements."},{"Patient":"Hello, My brother is 66 and for the past year or so, he has been falling.

Symptoms of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo are triggered by specific changes in the position of your head, such as tipping your head up or down, and by lying down, turning over or sitting up in bed. You may also feel out of balance when standing or walking.At first a brain CT scan or MRI scan might be required after undergoing a clinical examination. If there is no problems in the brain then it can help if you get tests for studying any abnormality involving the vestibular apparatus which is part of the inner ear.

At first you must make sure that you do not suffer from conditions arising due to reduced amounts of Vitamin B 12. Taking metformin which is an oral glucose lowering drug can cause Vitamin B 12 malabsorption state and lead to deficiency affecting the nerves. Adding supplements might help. Diabetic neuropathy also requires medications to treat pain which include gabapentin, pregabalin and carbamazepine which are prescribed for nerve pain.Since you have numbness, you should also check your feet regularly for any non healing wounds and get treated on time. Diabetics with neuropathy often do not realize wounds on their feet and this can also get serious."},{"Patient":"I have like a tingling sensation in my scalp , which when I touch my scalp it s sore.

Tingling sensation can be felt in the scalp due to irritation of the branches of these nerves along their course. There are certain conditions which might cause tingling of the scalp region and needs to be examined by your doctor and evaluated in detail. This includes conditions like shingles which can cause a tingling sensation in the scalp for a long time before rashes start appearing. There are also other causes like pinching of nerves. Since you are having dull pain behind the right eye, getting it checked is important. Pain behind the eye can also originate from irritation of nerves.

He injected those and I seemed to get some relief at first, but it didn t last through one lawn mowing.","Doctor":"The spine is made up of an alignment of small bones. These bones have sponge like discs between them and the spinal cord passes along the back of these bones through the spinal canal. Between the bones we also have nerve roots originating in the spinal cord and passing through foramen between bones.You seem to be having discs at a particular level that is protruding between the bones and this protrusion is backwards and causing symptoms.The discs protruding at level L 5 - S 1 with a tear at the periphery of the disc. It might also cause obliteration of lateral recess and neural foraminal compromise. This is leading to pinching of nerves causing severe pain.There are patients who get relief by doing physiotherapy and taking neurogenic pain relievers for up to a year. Injections are also given for relief. However this might not always happen. If your pain is severe and not responding to medical treatment then the disc protrusion needs to be removed by doing a small surgery at the lower back region by a neurosurgeon. Presently, laser assisted surgical techniques and radio frequency ablation is also available.The inflammation at SI joint requires regular injections.You can try to feel more comfortable at work by taking small breaks every 30 minutes and not straining your spine especially the painful areas."},{"Patient":"Hi, ihave been tender in the stomach area, having dizziness and slight nausea, pains in lower large intestine area.

Though the pressure on nerve roots at strategic locations seems to be relieved by doing surgical procedure, the patient might often complain severe lower back pain even after surgery. This happens in about 20 to 40 percent of patients and the reason is that the affected nerve roots are still under pressure in areas other than where surgical manipulation has been done.You can choose to get repeat surgery done but that also has limitations after a fusion surgery. Please discuss non surgical procedures like radio frequency techniques and targeted nerve root block. These are temporary procedures and might need repeat sessions every year.Wishing the patient a quick recovery."},{"Patient":"HI, For the last one month, I have been experiencing tiredness, sleepyness, dizzy and pain in the temple area.

However, its been a week now and I dont see improvement. I am worried. Please help and suggest which doc (specialist) i should consult for this issue. Regards Rajesh","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is possible that you have higher than insulin levels circulating in your blood. This is causing the blood glucose levels to go below normal and that can cause problems like tiredness or dizziness. This if confirmed might be the opposite of diabetes where the insulin does not act on receptors. You should consult a doctor who deals with conditions of pancreas. They can be gastroenterologists or endocrinologists. They have to do certain tests to know the source of high insulin and few tests like insulin levels in blood and ultrasound and CT scan might be asked for. There are small tumors called insulinomas in the pancreas which secrete excess insulin and a search for such tumors is indicated. Insulinoma is a benign tumor of the pancreas in 90 percent of patients and removal of the tumor cures the patient of the symptoms.

Can this be causing my symptoms?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is possible that the venous angioma might be causing all your symptoms. The venous angioma is an entanglement of vessels and it is in the back of the brain in right parietal and occipital lobes. The size of the lesion is not known and the symptoms might vary with the size of the angioma. Since it is located in the right occipital lobe and it is causing problems on the left side. Unless I see the images it is difficult to confirm all the possibilities but in many people headache can also be caused due to such tumors.

It is usually a successful procedure but 10 to 20 percent people might have some pain even after the surgery. In that case you might have to get repeat MRI scan imaging done to know if there is pinching of nerves at some other place in the lower back. Many times it has been observed that the nerves remain under pressure even after surgery. This is because compression on the nerves occurs at places other than where surgery has been done. You might have to go through repeat surgery if the pain is severe. Else you can also choose to take treatments like radio frequency ablation and nerve root block.

This can be due to an acute cause like shingles which is a viral infection affecting the dorsal nerve ganglion in the spinal nerves or due to chronic problems like neuropathy associated with diabetes or auto immune disorders.History of any other medical conditions and medications that you are taking is important. Vitamin deficiency states can also appear as non specific symptoms as described by you. However this is less likely as you are having sudden variation in symptoms.Please consult a neurologist and get a complete neurological examination done. If there is sudden worsening of symptoms then you might have to go to the ER. Investigations like MRI scan brain and spinal cord might also be required for you.Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hello, my son cut his head about a week ago, and I ve noticed a strong door coming from the wound (it was sealed with medical glue at the hospital), it s very similar to basalmic vinegar. Is this a normal part of the healing process? Thanks! Heather","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.A wound in the scalp if sealed then should be watched for any signs of secondary infection. A strong odor can be due to the medications and substance used to seal the wound. The smell might be strong but is never foul. If you suspect that the smell is foul and there is some discharge from the area of the sealed wound then please go back to the doctor and get the wound examined. Sometimes the wound can develop infection even after the skin surface is sealed. This happens in contaminated wounds and if there is an infection going on under the skin.If your son complains of burning pain, the skin over wound has become red and there is discharge with foul smell then please have the wound seen by the doctor. They will update you on wound healing and assure you on his condition. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Yesterday i was in the car and started to not feel well. I get car sick sometimes so i figured it was just that. But it kept getting worse. It was just pain that i couldnt control. I stopped at a gas station thinking if i peed it would help. When i got out of the van i was really weak and tripped over myself walking in and was very dizzy. Once i got inside i rushed to the counter and asked where the bathrooms were. Once i got in there, i stubbled into the stall and everything was still blurry. I couldnt find the lock on the door and started rubbing my hand on the door searching for it. I finally found it, sat on the toilet and just blacked out. I was sweating the whole time and got so hot in the bathroom i took my shirt off. I had another episode tonight but not as severe. I was out eating pizza and was looking at my phone and all of a sudden i just blacked out and dont even know what happened. Id just like to know whats going on.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Blurring, dizziness with syncope is an emergency situation and can be due to many reasons. It might happen due to decreased blood flow from heart to brain. When it happens, the blood flowing through the vessels from heart to brain might have a reduced flow. These are by the carotid and vertebral arteries on either sides. You might require a brain scan and other investigations to study the flow of blood to the brain.There are also many other causes of dizziness within the brain like a small stroke like episode or any infection. Please get yourself consulted by a doctor to evaluate any conditions like severe flu or infections of the ear and brain that might have caused your problems.Dizziness cal also occur due to problems in the inner ear and balance mechanism of the body. The balance mechanism in humans is partly due to the functioning of small hair cells in the inner ear. An infection in ear called labrynthitis can also cause sudden symptoms."},{"Patient":"My son is one year has been delaye milestone.

Start physiotherapy . whats wrong pls give any suggestion or medicine.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Your child is too young to start any active interventions at this age other than controlling seizures by medication. Levipil must be continued to prevent seizures. He might also require a MRI scan brain to know the brain development at one year and if there is any underlying condition that requires urgent treatment. Your neurologist will be able to discuss the MRI findings and if anything needs to be done. Please follow the learning milestones of your child closely and consult a child guidance clinic. The child guidance clinic is a team of people comprising a psychologist, psychiatrist, pediatrician, neurologist and they will evaluate your child from more than one angle and suggest you techniques that you can use to help your child grow better and as normal as possible.

Could the Prednisone be doing it or could I have MS.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Numbness, burning, or tingling in the face, arms, legs, feet or hands can be due to serious side effect of taking prednisone. This is considered one of the serious side effects and must be communicated to your doctor urgently.MS is a condition that can have any of the neurological symptoms but the diagnosis is based on a criteria found on MRI imaging. This is the McDonald criteria and MS is suspected only if there is appearance of new lesions on follow up MRI with spatial and temporal reference and the lesions showing certain characteristics in pattern and distribution. If your doctor has seen your MRI and said there are no features of MS then you probably do not have the condition.However, you can observe and express your symptoms in the coming months to your doctor and discuss if repeat imaging by MRI might be required after few months, depending on the progress of symptoms."},{"Patient":"HI there my 15 year old daughter has had lower abdomen pain on her lower left side since weds (3 days ago) we saw out GP and he gave her a thorough check and suggested problem could be bowel or ovarie related and if no improvement we may need further investigations.

Then it courses along various structures to supply important organs of the body. Please get examined clinically to know at which level your vagus nerve is damaged. Vagus nerve disorders can be treated to some extent by learning to do activities that stimulate the nerve. This includes exercises of the pharynx and soft palate, or the area at the top of the mouth. Through a combination of vocalizations, breathing techniques and movements, the exercises may stimulate the vagus nerves and reduce some of the symptoms.There is also vagal nerve stimulation procedure by which the nerve can be stimulated with electrical impulses.

And yesterday at work, my vision just went haywire. It was like someone was putting a bunch of lenses in front of my eyes that were too thick and blurry. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The balance mechanism in humans is taken care of by the cerebellum which is a structure in the back of the brain and also by the vestibular system located in the inner ear. As you are experiencing disturbances in balance when bending down, it might be that the hair cells in the inner ear are getting disturbed and this causes moments of dzziness and inability to balance yourself. Vision is also connected to the vestibular system and hence you are having associated symptoms including blurred vision.You might have to get tests for studying any abnormality involving the vestibular apparatus which is part of the inner ear. Electronystagmography (ENG) or videonystagmography (VNG) done to record abnormal eye movements while your head is placed in different positions or your balance organs are stimulated with water or air. For this you might consult the ENT specialist."},{"Patient":"HI , couple of days back , i felt like my head /body is revolving and that time i feel really unbalance type of my body and eyes also feel bit pain and blotting my view . is it also an affection of giddiness? or do i need to consult a doctor imm. tnx jay","Doctor":"HIWell come to HCMFirst of all your age and gender is great matters here which missed here, okay still I would guess this could be due to vestibular dysfunction condition some time self limiting if this is due to some viral infection of cold and allergic condition, if this does not come around then you really need to see the ENT surgeon, hope this information helps, take care."},{"Patient":"Hi,My daughter is 4 years old she was diagnosed epileptic when her 'febrile seizures' turned into full blown grand mal and petit mal seizures out of nowhere.

In most cases control of fever results in control of seizures, but now the seizures have progressed to generalised seizures. Keppra is LEVETIRACETAM and the drug is used commonly for seizures but the drug is not approved as mono therapy for generalised tonic clonic seizures (Grandmal seizures). Her drooling, clenching of teeth could be occurring due to seizures only.I would advise you to take her to a doctor again for reevaluation. She should be checked for serum calcium levels to rule out hypocalcemia (low calcium levels are commonly found in seizures in children). Also EEG should find out any seizure focus and to localise the seizures. Medicines like Sodium Valproate, Carbamazapine etc can be used to control her seizures. As she is less than 4 years old then drugs like Phenytoin can also help her. These medicines are broad spectrum anti-seizure drugs and will control her seizures. If she develops fever at any time try to give her cold sponging and paracetamol to control fever. Visit her doctor for prescription.Thanks, hope this helps you. Take care"},{"Patient":"My sister is 66 years old, no heart problems, however she has recently been diagnosed with dementia.

The normal MRI findings are in favor of this diagnosis. But the age is a little exceptional for primary migraine. Another possible diagnosis in this case would be partial Epilepsy.

It is usually not common to see memory loss or cognitive decline at your age so there is no need to worry for that. Most of individuals of your age with memory problems have anxiety or mild depression. Some times low Vitamin B12 levels also results in such symptoms of forgetfulness. I would advise you to get your B12 levels checked to find out the exact cause of your symptoms. If B12 levels come low then start taking Multivitamin supplements and this would help in improvement of your symptoms.If everything come normal then visit a psychiatrist for evaluation of your symptoms. Forgetfulness in day to day task could occur due to anxiety or mild depression. Your sleep is normal but such symptoms could be stress related. Low doses of anti anxiety drugs like SSRIs would help in improvement of these symptoms.Thanks, hope this helps you. Take care"},{"Patient":"Sir, I have polio since I was 6months baby.

These roots travel along the arm and become a nerve which ends in supplying the small introssseous, flexor, externsor and lumbrical muscles of the hand.The index finger also has introssseous, flexor, externsor and lumbrical muscles and twitching is brought about by the irritation of any one or more of the muscles in the area.It will help to go to a neurologist and get examined completely.

Holding a brace would be very helpful. Postural education, physiotherapy, avoiding sitting positions for a long time, or holding heavy things would also be helpful. I would also recommend Amytriptiline, an antidepressant drug for some months . You must be careful if starting this therapy to have a cardiologic consultation as it has heart side effects.

In my opinion the symptoms you have had are probably due to an Ischemic transitory attack ( called TIA). It is a transitory obstruction of a brain vessel. In your case  mitral valve prolapse may be the cause. There are different studies about this heart disorder , which can produce blood clots to go to the brain. This is an alarm sign.

Dizziness, headaches, ear pressure , tinglings may be caused by an orthostatic hypotension. I would recommend a full blood count to rule out anemia . A measurement of blood pressure in sitting position and after 5minutes in standing up position would be necessary to rule out orthostatic hypotension. If there is a decrease of more than 20mmHg to your systolic blood pressure when standing up it may be an orthostatic hypotension. All these symptoms can also be caused by depression .

It s been there for about a year now and it s slowly getting larger. The pain isn t extremely bad but more uncomfortable to where I can t lean against anything like a chair or even sleep on my back. If I stand too long it gets sore and goes numb and feels like pins and needles","Doctor":"There are different pathologies that can present with a lump. That can be a skin or soft tissue tumor, for example a lipoma or atheroma with may have been infected lately causing pain, it may be a skin infection, or even an subcutaneous drainage of a coccygeal or anal fistula. There are also some congenital pathologies of the spine that have also to be excluded.

I had an MRI and CT Scan done it states L1-2 L2-3 broad -based posterior disc bulge is present withour significant central spinal cana nor foraminal stenosis, L3-4 a similar broad-based posterior disc bulge/disc marginal osteophyte complex is present which appears to cause a mild central spinal canal stenosis with midline AP diameter of thecal sac measuring approximately 9 to 10 mm. L4-5 There is good decompression of the posterior aspect of the thecal sac at this level without significant central spinal canal stenosis. Unfoofing of the posterior disc margin is present with a partially fused facets at this level. Mild right and moderate left formaminal stenosis is present. In plain english tell me what is wrong with me please.","Doctor":"Your actual symptoms are because of the spinal stenosis which have several causes. Spinal stenosis can arise from aging, arthritis, as a complication of the surgery also. You have to try NSAID like Ibuprofene 800-1200mg a day or Diclophenac 75-100mg a day, muscle relaxants like Thiocholchicoside to relieve the pain. You have to exercise to strengthen your abdominal and back muscles. Bicycling can be a alleviating exercise. If you do not have any improvement you should see your neurosurgeon for epidural steroid injection or surgical intervention. Hope my answer will help."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor.

Cluster HA is commonly one sided. The HA happens in clusters everyday for a number of days or even weeks. It disappears for months then, but can happen again.To abort a HA you can use oxygen 100% by mask, or triptans (like sumatriptan) sbcutaneous or eegotamines intravenous.

Most patient are identified with this malformation incidental and they are asymptomatic. These anomalies have a very low risk of bleeding, except when they have an adjacent cavernoma (which seems not to be your case) and usually they don't need any treatment. As venous angiomas are developmental, they become like anormal part of the brain venous drainage. Surgery or other techniques can cause infarctions. In very rare cases it can present with seizured (which again isn't your case).I would suggest you to stay calm and take a treatment with NSAID for your headache, stay in touch with a neurologist if smth else happens ."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor.

I understand your concern. In my opinion a disc bulge in that level of your column may be the cause of these symptoms. The protrusion may be an inflammatory lesion , or just the a bone related with your spinal nerves at the point of the column where they get out from the spine. Other possible diagnosis, more rare may be lesions of the spine like tumors, cysts , etc. I would recommend you see a doctor and have a lumbar column x ray and a blood routine test to rule out these diagnosis.

But now it's almost been a year and I have headaches Lasting Months without any improvement. What could be it?","Doctor":"Hello thanks for asking from HCMCalcified granuloma in brain can occur due to a number of findings. Neurocysticercosis, Tubercular granuloma, granuloma due to old injury etc are common causes. In most cases calcified granuloma doesn't result in severe symptoms and individuals may suffer mild headaches. But in some individuals it may cause terrible headaches by compression of adjacent structures or may result in seizures or some neurological complication. You have calcified granuloma in temporal lobe and is causing headache so should not be ignored. Consult a neuropsychiatrist for treatment of headache.If on MRI there is evidence of edema near granuloma then steroids should be given for short duration to reduce edema. For headache medicines like Amitryptiline, Nortryptiline, Phenytoin, carbamazapine etc can be used. These medicines can help to relieve headache. For severe headache associated with seizures anti-convulscents can be used.

Once the pain has subsided you can start doing back muscle strengthening exercises so that they can act as a natural corset that can hold the vertebral disc in place.

Some are genetic and some are result of genetic and environmental factors. So it is impossible to make a guess as to which is which. It can be done only after looking for known mutations or genes in your genetic constitution. However the symptoms you are experiencing do indicate depression only and you need to see a physician for that. If I were you, I wouldn't worry about getting Alzheimer's at this point. Get the depression looked at initially. You should also start involving yourself in intellectually motivating activities like doing crosswords and sudokus or taking up new courses.

The contraction of the large bowel to expel this can give you the pain. There can be an internal problem like an ulcer or a mass contributing to this.

I have been on adderall 30mg ER for some time, but I recently suffered two brain injuries. I won t get into stories, because they re long and complicated, but due to all the brain trauma, my rehab Dr put me on amantidine, although at the time I hadn t told him about the adderall, for no reason, I just forgot because I wasn t taking it all the time. Now that I m feeling better, I m wondering if these are two drugs that should be mixed given their affinity for the dopamine receptors/pathways. Thank you","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern.Those two drugs have a synergistic effect, meaning they both increase the effect of the other. It's not a major interaction, at times it can not be present at all and they could be used together.

But for some reason I can carry heavy objects but the moment I pick them, a growing seeping flow which turns into pain develops in my left upper scapula and I have to drop the weight. Any ideas what s going on. THe neurologist says that the pain from my compression in ulna in the funny bone is referring it backwards. THe elbow surgeon says that the pain can t travel so much back. So now the elbow surgeon has sent me for a shoulder MRI thinking something related to the shoulder. I am confused with no resolution. Waiting on the result of the shoulder MRI from the orthopedic surgeon. The spine surgeon who twisted my neck in different directions and since there was no pain and after looking at the neck MRI said that the pain is not coming from the neck.","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern and confusion.I tend to agree with both doctors. That means that I would put the cubital tunnel syndrome as the most likely diagnosis and explain the shoulder pain by its referral.However since there could be other less likely causes I believe the elbow surgeon is right in aiming to be thorough and do an MRI to exclude other possibilities.So you should continue with therapy for cubital syndrome and try to see the coming MRI results only as a means of reassurance not as something to worry about.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"hello, my name is katie last night i noticed a knot on the back of my head, it doesn t hurt but, it still worries me, could you tell me what it is.. I have also been having really bad migraines and every morning i wake up my mouth is horribly dry I dont know if this has anything to do with anything but, I would really love to know. Please write me back, thank you!","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.If you have noticed the knot only recently and it is small but painful then most likely it can be an infection. It is important to get it examined by a doctor and then proceed with the clinical findings. The size, consistency and location of the knot are important to be known. Since the exact details are not know, it is difficult to say if you really require detailed investigations and imaging.Such knots are less likely to be related to migraines and your waking up in the morning and with a dry mouth. I will suggest that you drink adequate amounts of water and fluids and keep yourself hydrated. It is also important to know if you take any medications which might have a tendency to cause drying of secretion in mouth."},{"Patient":"I was born in June of 1964 with congenital hydrocephalus.

Likelihood of needing a new shunt or revision?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Congenital hydrocephalus is a condition where there is increase brain fluid as you might be aware and this needs to be drained properly using surgical placement of shunts. As you have had shunt surgeries many years back, it will help to see the present situation of the hydrocephalus by doing a brain scan. Since there was arrested hydrocephalus that happens due to aqueductal stenosis, in 1977 which was 37 years back, it is important to know the developments in recent years.There are 3 methods presently to treat arrested hydrocephalusMonitoringPerforming an endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV)Implanting a shuntIf you have been monitored for 37 years and there is no sudden development of changes or increase in clinical symptoms then there is no need of doing endoscopic thid ventriculostomy or revision of shunt."},{"Patient":"I have found a indention in the crown of my head that is tender to touch and feels puffy.

Please consult your doctor and know if it is a mild infection as it is tender or something that need detailed evaluation. Pagets disease is a condition that evolves over time and unlikely to present acutely. Since you also have a migraine, it will help to do a MRI scan of brain and cervical spine should your symptoms be of a severe nature.The nerve damage in the neck region that you have mentioned needs a little more detail.

I went to a GP and Gynecologist 2 months ago and got hormone blood tests and I got regular annual check up blood tests done but all came back normal. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It will help to know your age and gynecological history in the past. It is known that even with normal test reports, some people might have symptoms like anxiety, night sweats and headaches. It can even be that you are normal and having a slight mental stress related anxiety and that is causing a perception of night sweats. This might also be confused with flushing in some people. It will help to get a slightly more detailed medical examination keeping your symptoms in mind. The adrenal hormones can cause headaches and night sweats in those who have a hyperactive state of the gland. This might need imaging investigations and specific hormone levels in blood. Treatment is based on the cause and persons with unexplained night sweats should seek medical care."},{"Patient":"I am in hospital having a trial for a pain pump for chronic back and leg pain.

The trial was fitted at my pain management doc . I have a lot of built up scar tissue after 3 back surgeries two within 60 days I think this has been moved to fit the cathature and I have bad hip and leg pains like burning on fire just like it was back in May 2013 after 2nd surgery. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Back surgery helps many patients with their pain but in some the pain might not be relieved completely. As you have had 3 back surgeries, the scar tissue might be causing irritation of nerve roots in the area. There is a condition called as failed back surgery syndrome and this is not a real syndrome. It is a condition where even after back surgery patients continue to experience pain as before or even worse due to many reasons. This is not due to the failed surgery as such but there might be one or more areas where nerve pinching is persistent and it is not possible to release the pressure on nerves entirely by doing surgery.This is possibly the reason you are having so much pain including in the hips and legs. Fentanyl and hydrocodone might help initially but then slowly these can develop tolerance and medications need to be reviewed regularly. Newer medications are being developed which are targeted to nerve related pain. Please discuss these options with your pain medication doctor."},{"Patient":"My stomach has been bothering me for about 2mos. I have pain in my upper abdomen, it seems to have gotten worse recently.

One week later i still have tightness and soreness in all my chest, shoulders, and arms. My MRI showed good on the cervical disk. How long will this take to get better and what steps can i do to help it along the way? i.e. message, stretching, etc?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.A cervical laser disc procedure is minimally invasive but unfortunately you had an infection which has taken 3 weeks to clear. Also you reported lifting weights over your allowed limits and this also delayed your recovery. Along with the infection, the muscles also might have gone in to spasm and this can cause the persistent tightening up. As the MRI done recently shows that the spine and discs are in place therefore the pain and tightness might not be related to the discs alone. It is possible that there is some kind of muscle spasm in the muscles of the chest, shoulders and arms, all of which have nerves of common origin.It might take another 2 to 4 weeks to feel comfortable. You can try gently applying ointments containing muscle relaxant and pain reliever combination twice a day. Using heat pad will also give you comfort. Mild stretching and massage under guidance of your physiotherapist might help."},{"Patient":"I have a question about my husband. He is a 47 yearold african american male that is 6 4 290 lbs. He has been experienceing numbness on the left side of his head. It begins at the top of his head and he feels it on his face, his nose, the top of his mouth and on his lips. I would like to know if he should go to the ER.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Numbness in the head on the left side needs to be investigated clinically. There are nerves which supply that part of the face and this requires clinical examination including that of the cranial nerves 5 and 7. The fifth cranial nerve is the trigeminal nerve and seventh is the facial nerve. These nerves have origins in the brain and arise from nuclei in the brain. The nerves are tested by doing simple clinical examination. If there is any dysfunction suspected in the nerves then the doctor will ask for a brain scan such as MRI to be done. This will help in finding out any cause in the nerve that can be causing his symptoms. Please consult a neurologist and get treated.If these symptoms have appeared over few hours then it can be due to a stroke like event and he must go to ER immediately."},{"Patient":"what are the possible reasons to explain why I experienced dizziness and fell to the floor injuring myself because I was unable to stand up or maintain consciousnessf after getting out of the bathtub? Did I faint and/or lose consciousness? what should I do to prevent this from happening again?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Moments of dizziness can happen due to decreased blood flow from heart to brain. When it happens, the blood flowing through the vessels from heart to brain might have a reduced flow. These are by the carotid and vertebral arteries on either sides. This is more significant when you are standing upright and doing any moderate to heavy physical activity. You might require a CT scan or MRI scan of the brain.The best way to analyze if the reduced blood flow to the brain is causing your dizziness is by doing a carotid and vertebral arteries Doppler ultrasound. It will show the flow of blood from the heart to the brain and if it is adequate.Clinical examination of inner ear and vestibular system in the ear is also required.It might help to do a Electronystagmography (ENG) or videonystagmography (VNG) done to record abnormal eye movements while the head is placed in different positions or your balance organs are stimulated with water or air. For this you might have to consult the ENT specialist.Dizziness can also occur due to stress related anxiety or overflow of emotions."},{"Patient":"I ve had approx. 7 courses of treatment for HCV infection.

How do I know if my lightheadedness is temporary or permanent?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Interferon is a medication that is known to cause light headedness in some patients and this can continue for few months after treatment is stopped. Your doctor is right in saying that you will have to bear with side effects such as light headedness for a while after completing treatment.Known side effects include skin rash, itching, trouble breathing, a tight feeling in your chest, lightheadedness, a rapid heart beat, chest pain, or any unusual bleeding or bruising, swelling or tingling sensations in your feet or hands, or mental confusion (brain fog) among other symptoms.Patients are known to gradually improve with cessation of treatment.

My new massage therapist says my vertebrae don t feel normal in those areas. She said those spots feel flat. I made a follow up appointment with my doctor to insist on an X-Ray or MRI as per my massage therapist s instructions. What could be causing this and should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Your pregnancy has been over a year back and you should have made complete recovery from any problems arising out of the surgery at that time.Spine is made up of small bones aligned on top of each other and nerves originating in the spinal cord and exiting through holes between two bones. There are a disc between every two bones which provide cushioning. When the disc gets displaced and causes pressure on the nerves then pain is felt.The commonest reason for back pain at your age is muscle spasm but nerve related pain cannot be ruled out without doing a clinical examination. A X ray is the basic investigation and will show any muscle spasm or disc space narrowing. If strongly suspected then a MRI might be required to know if you have nerve pinching at any level.You can try using  heat pad and gently applying ointment containing pain reliever and muscle relaxant over the area where it is hurting in the back."},{"Patient":"I read about this hard bump on the back of my head said its on people born within 1980-2000 i am born in the year 2000 and am curious on what this bump is, it feels like a bone but im not sure, I was wondering if you could help me find out what this bump is. It s located on the back of my head in the middle","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.In my knowledge there is no such swelling which has been consistently associated with people born between 1980 to 2000. It will help to know specific details on the location, size and how fast it has been growing.Bony swellings over the back of the head need not necessarily be bone or arise from the inside. A lot of such swellings are firm enough to give a bony feeling and are usually benign swellings which can be called cysts. There are many types of cysts in the scalp like dermoid cyst, epidermoid cyst or sebaceous cyst.Please consult your doctor to know the probability of the swelling being a cyst or anything else. A CT scan brain might be required to characterize the swelling and know if it needs any immediate treatment.

The patching left me immobile for at least 5 days and ever since I have been experiencing bad lower back and left hip pain when sitting or laying a certain way. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Lower back pain after spinal tap is a known rare complication causing distress to the patient. It occurs in 0.3% of lumbar punctures and you might be one among them. This is essentially due to nerve root irritation during putting the needle in the spinal space while withdrawing the spinal fluid to check for meningitis. This pain can also be accompanied with headache. The pain needs symptomatic treatment and can last from 8 days to a year after the spinal tap. Please try using heat pad or doing physiotherapy to get relief from the pain. Avoid doing heavy physical activity or lifting heavy weights or making sudden back movements. Use applications containing pain reliever and muscle relaxants for reducing the pain. If pain persists after a year of the procedure then consult a pain clinic doctor."},{"Patient":"My father has gyral thickening and t2 and GRE hypointensity noted in the parasagital aspect of Left superior frontal lobewith predominantly t2 hyperintense signal in underlying sub cortical white matter ...blooming noted on GRE images within the gyral and subcortical white matter in the region of signal change venous haemorrhagic infarct to be considered mild t1 hyperintensity noted in the cortical veins overlying the lesion in the left frontal para sagittal region- cortical thrombosis may be considered .thrombosis involving half of the superior sagital sinus..prominent midline retro cerebellar space - mega ciaterna magna to be considered...before taking dis MRI he had seizures and irrelevant speech...plz kindly answer wat treatment he has to undergo","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The MRI scan shows clotting of blood withing passages of blood that is in the venous channels called dural venous sinuses.

You are in the third trimester and your blood pressure is more likely to decrease especially after physical exercise.

It radiates some around to the back. I am an avid runner and when increasing intensity the pulling/discomfort increases. I notice it a little after eating. I would not call it pain, but more discomfort. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for the question!In my opinion it may be nothing serious, just a muscular cramp from overstretch during  your physical exercise. You need a little rest .If the troubles don't go away I think you should go to a doctor have a physical examination, followed by an EKG, chest x ray to see your heart function and the Aorta. Although less likely to be coronary  disease as it happened during eating. An aorta dissection rarely can cause similar troubles.     Also in the end I would recommend a cervico- thoracal column x ray for any disc problems which can cause this symptom too.

But the symptoms you have may be also by the changes in the blood flow inside your brain. You had experienced TIA, and this means that your blood flow is not working very well. Yours it is a little complicated situation. You have both risks of ishemic and hemorrhagic stroke . But the aneurism has been clipped , so the risk of intracranial hemorrhage is probably as normal persons.

A few months ago I was told I had a brain lesion the size of a cotton ball after an MRI. Shortly after the MRI I had a spinal tap to rule out MS. My blood proteins are extremely high and my IGG... I guess this has to do with my immune system are off as well. I have been experiencing extreme memory loss, Nausea, lightheadedness for years now. Lately, I have been picking up viruses and flesh eating bacterias. In 1980, I was in an auto accident and experienced head trauma which resulted in long term memory lossI. years went by and I kept telling my doctors of my lighted headedness and what strange feeling in my head and falling and daily. In 2009, after a week of testing for headaches and memory loss and they told me it was my heart. I was told it may be stress and I was given pills and referred to a psychologist. In 2007, I blacked out in my washroom and experienced a concussion. This is when my doctor decided there may be a problem. After an EGG, I was diagnosed with having epilepsy. As my symptoms worsened in 2010, I was referred to the Mayo Clinic in MN. at that time, I was told I DID NOT have epilepsy, I had Automatic Neruropthy after a week of extensive testing. Well, I lost my job and lost my insurance and was unable to go back to the Mayo Clinic for treatment. Please can someone tell me if my symptoms sound like Alzheimer’s?","Doctor":"Hello ! Thank you for your question .All your symptoms go with the diagnosis of Autonomic Neuropathy. It is a disorder affecting your autonomic system, which regulates  your organs function. Your heart , blood pressure , bowel are all affected by this disorder . It is not curable, but symptoms can be treated , in order to have a better life quality. It has been probably caused by a wrong reaction of your immune system. The memory loss you have experiences is not a typical sign of the disease, but it can be caused by a lot of factors. I would like to know more about the lesion in your brain, found in MRI , its location and the nature . Our brain has different areas responsable for our memory. If the lesion is in an important area , it may cause memory loss. Alzheimer disease has abnormal brain atrophy non compatible to the age as a normal finding MRI scan, which you have not mentioned in your MRI results. The trauma you have had , contributes a lot to the memory loss. In my opinion Alzheimer disease is not very probable in your condition, but can also not be excluded. I recommend you to see a neuro - psychologist , have detailed cognitive examinations to determine your memory loss. Hope to have been helpful!Thank you for using HCM.

At C3-4 there is a 1mm central disk protrusion, with mild central canal stenosis. Mild facet arthropathy is present. 3. At C6-7 there is a broad disk/osteophyte with mild to moderate central canal stenosis. 4. Mild bilateral foraminal narrowing at C7-T1.Relative straightening of cervical lordosis. What does all this mean please? And would surgery be an option?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.1. Mild multilevel cerivcal discogenic/degerative changes, superimposed on congenital cervical spinal canal narrowing.There is degenerative changes in the discs between bones of the neck spine. This is probably due to age related changes. There is also a narrow spinal canal in you since birth and the degenerative changes makes it more narrow.2. At C3-4 there is a 1mm central disk protrusion, with mild central canal stenosis. Mild facet arthropathy is present.There is backwards displacement of disc at level C 3 - C 4 and this is causing a slight pressure effect on the spinal canal. This leads to pressure on the covering of spinal cord and pain symptoms. The joint between bones is also showing degenerative changes.3. At C6-7 there is a broad disk/osteophyte with mild to moderate central canal stenosis.There is also a broad disc displacement at C 6 - C 7 level and extra bone formation. The spinal canal is narrowed at this level.4. Mild bilateral foraminal narrowing at C7-T1.There is pressure on the nerve roots at level C 7 - T 1 and this can cause pain.5. Relative straightening of cervical lordosis.This shows that there is muscle spasm of the neck.In conclusion, medications and physiotherapy should be given for 6 to 12 months. There are new medicines which reduce nerve related pain. Also avoid making sudden neck movements. Surgery is indicated if the symptoms persist and worsen even after months of treatment with medications and physiotherapy.

Alcohol , smoking and cocaine can bring to addiction. Sudden stop can cause troubles called abstinence. Also use of cocaine and alcohol can cause serious changes to the brain blood flow.

Thank your question  ! In my opinion this is just psychological and physical stress  causing these troubles to you. The pain in the legs is caused by muscular contractions , especially after physical exercise. It is typical after a day work in the afternoon or evening.

In my opinion you have nothing to worry about it. The headache you have is caused by the contracted muscles of the scalp due to hair traction by the band in this case. It may be also aggravated by a wrong position of your head ( during staying or writing, working at the computer), from psychological stress, etc. Dizziness is another feature of this kind of headache ( Tension type Headache). Nothing is going to happen to your brain if you continue holding the band. Your brain is well protected! We have seen in patient who underwent brain surgery , that the bands very straight to the head can cause damage of skin in the pressure point, but it is not your case.

In my opinion it' s nothing serious. The troubles you have are caused by low blood pressure during standing up. This is called orthostatic hypotension. It causes hypoperfusion to your brain , which you perceive like blurrin vision and troubles hearing.You should have a good physical examination, a measure of your blood pressure in two positions , first lying and then after 5 minutes standing up. If your blood pressure decreases more than 20mm Hg, this is the diagnosis.You should have a blood routine test to rule out anemia which could also cause these symptoms.You should have further tests like EKG , a cardiologist consult to find out the main cause of hypotension.Hope to have been helpful!Best wishes, Dr Abaz"},{"Patient":"I have numbness on my left side from shoulder to foot .

Short answer : You should be seen by a neurologist, have a cervical spine CT scan. Detailed answer : I think your problems are related to the cervical spine and intervertebral disks. The tightness of your neck is caused by the muscle contraction , induced by the cervical disk. The numbnes you feel on the left side of your body show that your spine has been compressed by the displaced disk in the lower cervical part of the column. A good physical examination for neurological signs is helpful. You should have a cerviko-thoracal CT scan or MRI , which will show the disk displacement better and the relations with your medulla.

I think you might have been experiencing a specific kind of Epilepsy seizure( probably partial complex occipital lobe Epilepsy)  during the EEG . The heavy breathing you have done before this happened , has excited your brain, so that a seizure occurred. This is a normal procedure during EEG .

As we age the cushiony disc between the vertebrae becomes more dessicated and dried which results in its compression or protrusion outwards. This can sometime compress the nerve and cause pain at the part it supplies. You will need to see a Spine specialist and get a MRI of upper back done and a hard cervical collar can certainly help with your symptoms provided the MRI has shown the cause.

Then it turned into numbness in my feet and cramps in my legs. My legs feel weak and it is hard to climb the stairs. I am pretty alarmed by the tingling in my legs. Can you please help me with an idea of where to start with my doctor. All he wants to do is give me Neurotin however I was hoping that there may be some test to find out what is causing all these symptoms.","Doctor":"Hi,The tingling and weakness are motor and sensory symptoms you are experiencing due to nerve compression in the lower back. I would suggest you to fix an appointment with a spine surgeon and get a MRI of your lower back along with whole spine screening. That will pin point any compression that is happening and also give a clue to about how the prognosis can be. Meanwhile you can continue with the Neurontin."},{"Patient":"hello my pain mgt doc is telling me that I need a morphine drip implanted in my spine . I have had steroid shots , burn the nerves , and 2 tims unit s in me now . would a operation help I gess the gell between my vertibay is hard so I am alowies in pain what would help?","Doctor":"Hi,If you have already seen a spine surgeon and he concurs with the treatment it is the right way to go. If not, I suggest you consult with a spine surgeon and get MRI done and if his opinion is along the lines of those with the pain management doctor, then definitely it is worth giving a shot. Meanwhile I would suggest you to explore physical therapy as well with ultrasonography and interference therapy, you will get a temporary relief. It can be done for 1-2 weeks."},{"Patient":"Have cervical stenosis at c5,6,7 lower lumbar stenosis c3,4 osetharthis grade 3 in knees my medication help very little have not had a,body scan in 3years for narrowing of spinal cord. Just feel am getting pushed from pillar to post, docs now say I have fibromyalgia. The pain is really get me down","Doctor":"Hi,Decompression surgery is the best option for you. But before all that, I suggest you see a spine surgeon and seek his opinion with all your scans too. After a thorough physical examination, if the cause of the pain seems to originate from the nerve compression, it probably is not fibromyalgia. The best thing is to get a repeat MRI scan after consulting with your spine surgeon. Hope this answered your question."},{"Patient":"Dr. Keerthi, I have had a seizure disorder for 23 years, controlled/free for 19 years, recently it has come back again I am trying to figure out why.

Certainly stress can be a trigger for seizures and you might also want to get the drug levels in the blood checked up after discussing with your physician. Sometimes other drugs that you might take for cold etc., can clear this drug quickly and can cause the seizures to begin again. Meanwhile do not make any changes without first consulting your physician. Also make sure that you do the daily activities in a timed manner like your breakfast, and also get a fixed number of 8-9 hours of sleep daily at a fixed time. Any deviation from a routine too can cause a trigger."},{"Patient":"I have a impinchment at C 2 thru 6. It is causing severe terriblemuscle weakness pain,unable to sleep, unbalance.

Please first consult with the spine specialist and get a thorough physical examination done. If biopsy too has confirmed TB you can get started with the regimen and follow it up with the physician at regular intervals for blood and liver checks.

Syncope, some seizure discharge or even sleep paralysis can cause similar symptoms. As this sudden loss of consciousness was associated with fainting and tightness of extremities so it points more towards some seizure disorder. You should take her to a neuropsychiatrist for proper help. She should underwent EEG testing to rule out any seizure focus and CT imaging to rule out any brain lesion if any. Once every thing comes normal then she can be evaluated with detail by a neuropsychiatrist.Thanks, hope this helps you.

I understand your concern. In my opinion the symptoms you describe are not due to a nerve entrapment. The nerve ( the Trigeminus nerve ) responsible for the sensibility of half of your face , is responsable also for the sensibility of half of the tongue ( same part) and not just the tip. Your symptoms are not suggesting a nerve intrapement . But I think that after having excluded anemia and thyroid disorders , a neurological examination followed by a brain MRI should be done to exclude another disorder like Multiple Sclerosis. Nothing to worry about. This could be  a less probable diagnosis, but it is necessary to be excluded. In my opinion the more probabel cause could be psychological , but you have to exclude other causes to get to this conclusion. Wish to have been helpful !

I am not anxious and not stressed because i have a good job and happy life. To explain my feeling, it is a feeling like i have not slept for 2 days, so it is a kind of vertigo, but i don t feel like i am passing out, but i am dizzy and get tired soon and have to focuse a lot on everything even walking, or reading my emails because my brain is clumsy. P.S: no problem with hearing or any sound in my head. I would really appreciate if you could help me. Thanks","Doctor":"Thank you for your question ! I understand your concern. Vertigo and dizziness are a common problem through young patients . It could be caused also a viral infection. Arterial Hypotension , psychological stress, labyrinth problems , migraine are excluded in this case by your history. A neurological examination should be done first.

The brain freezing and tingling are common symptoms of some types of headache. The brain MRI has ruled out any other serious problems. I would like to know more about the duration, precipitation factors and localization of your headache. In my opinion its a Tension type headache. Zooloft is very helpful for this situation. You should continue taking it for at least 3 months. You will see results from the third weak of treatment. You should have a headache diary to register  time and duration of headache every day.

As one ages the the intervertebral disc becomes more brittle and the repair mechanisms kick in which result in the osteophyte complexes. These are the ones which are impinging on the nerves and causing the complaints. If your symptoms get worse with time or you begin to show weakness in your limbs, it might then need surgery to correct the narrowing of the foramen and freeing up that area. It would be better to discuss it with your spine specialist and get an MRI done to clearly analyze it."},{"Patient":"iwas told ihad sciatica thepain are im legs it comes and goes iwent for mri cat scan they wanted to give shots i wont take them they also said a herniated disk some days no pain and some day ihave pain i take tylenol the pain is at night icant sleep ineed helpfor dr rynne dr.rogala and drchoudharythank you","Doctor":"Hi,The pain in your legs can only be temporarily treated with the pain medications. Its cause needs to be investigated and MRI without contrast i.e. Plain MRI (for which you don't need any shots) of the lower back is enough to investigate the cause. If MRI is not feasible a CT too can be done but it is not as informative as a MRI is. As for the pain, I would advise you to avoid carrying heavy weights, bend forward excessively or sit for prolonged durations. If you are slightly on the obese side, you need to start exercising and lose some weight. It causes a significant decrease in pain."},{"Patient":"My wife had a history of Verigo.

I also noticed a new metallic taste in my mouth. Is this something I need to be concerned about?","Doctor":"For herniated disc you can start with a conservative management like postural correction during work and graded physiotherapy exercises. If that doesn't prove helpful epidural steroid injections might help in which 3 injections of triamcenalone are injected in epidural space at the interval of 1 week each.this will definitely help to improve your symptoms. Last resort for your problem is to go for operative discectomy which could be either endoscopic or open."},{"Patient":"I m 55 and experiencing an odd electrical type impulse from my left ankle to my hip joint. Also having the same feeling within my rib cage. I have chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic pain, fibromyalgia and am a broken neck survivor.

I understand how frustrating this must have been over the years. This is a chronic diarrhea and would need a closer interrogation and investigation to establish the exact cause. It could be  a parasite but the chances of this being true over the years is very  low. I will suggest you get her evaluated by a gastroenterologist. Dissociate travel abroad and the complaints and just let the doctors manage her fully for chronic diarrhea because linking this up with her travel always makes it  to have a biased approach.I hope this helps.

Does this warrant a visit to the doctor?","Doctor":"Hi,The CT brain is the gold standard for any head injury. If it has shown a normal study, you needn't be worried. The bump on head is probably soft tissue swelling and it should recede in a week or two. Applying an ice-pack will certainly help in decreasing it further and the pain too should go away. You could also take an over-the-counter Tylenol for the pain.

The symptoms however can always be treated with physical therapy, pain medications and proper maintenance of posture. One of the most important thing is you should not lift heavy weights immediately in postoperative period or after a diagnosis has been made. These activities along with bending forward and sitting for longer durations will certainly aggravate the pain and the condition. You must frequently offload the weight by walking and standing for 5-10 minutes after sitting for period of 20-30 minutes. You can join the gym but weight lifting should be avoided as far as possible in the postoperative period."},{"Patient":"I have had a nri 4yrs. ago and have a broad based c5-c6 osteophyte complex with out focal disc protrusion or central canal stenosis.

Could it have gotten worse maybe need another MRI?","Doctor":"Hi,The symptoms which are getting severe are indicative of progression of cervical spondylosis. You will need a repeat-MRI scan and have it compared with the previous scan to measure the canal diameter and look for disc protrusion or nerve compression. A nerve might have got pinched as it emerges out from the spine which is causing the severe pain. It needs to be looked at and basing on the severity of symptoms you may need to undergo surgery."},{"Patient":"I am 66 and have just been told I have cervical spondylosis.

What lies ahead and what precautions I can take?","Doctor":"Hi,You are experiencing symptoms of cervical myelopathy where the cervical nerves which supply your hands and neck, get pinched by the growths near the borders of the vertebrae, which called osteophytes. If the symptoms are worsening, (and there is a scoring system for that) and the spine surgeon feels you satisfy the scoring system, you might need a surgery in the future. The exact type of surgery and approach are guided by the symptoms and what imaging shows. As for the precautions you can start with putting on a hard cervical collar which would restrict movement in the neck and alleviate the symptoms. For the initial few days it will be cumbersome and might seem to make the problem worse, though if you persist it should help. There may be skin maceration etc., due to continuous friction and sweat. Kindly discuss this with your physician before wearing a collar."},{"Patient":"As of about 3 or 4 days ago I began having pain at the base of my spine. Right about where the butt crack begins.

It almost feels like it goes around the base of my spine instead of being linear, a round ball, or something normal. I ve never really felt swelling like this. I just want to know if I should be concerned or if it s hopefully something that should just pass.

Have you completely recovered from it or if there are residual symptoms still? However I would urge you to fix an appointment with a neurologist and discuss about starting antiplatelet medications. It is very important that you see him immediately as there are increased chances of stroke following a transient ischemic attack.

This pain can shoot up my leg to the knee or down to the foot. There is no obvious swelling or redness. Look forward to your reply. Many thanks, Diane Scott","Doctor":"Hi Diane,The reason for the pain could be a pinched nerve, the one supplying your legs. Once a nerve is pinched at its origin from the spinal cord, the symptoms may be felt along its course too. This 'pinching' can be caused due to many reasons and to find the reason you would have to get a MRI scan of your lower back or the lumbo-sacral spine. The frozen shoulder and this pain radiating to knee and foot are not related. Provided the MRI scan shows the reason for the pain, it can be managed with medications and physiotherapy and in case it doesn't help, you would require a surgery at a later stage."},{"Patient":"I was encountered by seizures and upon doing the tests the reports said Calcified granuloma in right fronto-parietal lobe with small adjacent hypodensity ?Gliosis??Reactive Edema Can you please help me in identifying the risks and intensity of the effect of the above result.

Mild facet arthrosis and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy with patent L4 neural foramen. Also, L5-S1 small left paracentral protrusion with left posterolateral annular fissure,mild mass effect on the arthrosis and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy with patent L5 neural foramen. MRI lumbar spine demonstrates mild central stenosis at L-L5 due to a central protrusion with midline annular and mild facet arthrosis. L%-S1 small left paracentral protrusion with left posterolateral annular fissure. There is mild mass effect on the left S1 nerve root. Can you explain what this means and is it the cause of my pain?","Doctor":"Hi,The MRI findings you have described certainly do explain your symptoms of the pain. Between every two vertebrae there is a shock-absorbing material known as a intervertebral disc. It has an outer rim called 'Annular fibrosus' and an inner material called 'Nucleus pulposus'; which is basically the shock-absorbent. Under some circumstances the outer rim can break open (fissure), and the disc then bulges out. Unfortunately as it protrudes out it can impinge or press upon the nerves that come out of the spinal cord to supply your lower limbs. This impingement at various levels, causes the neuropathic symptoms that you are experiencing. This is a very brief explanation and there are many descriptors used which need not be elucidated here. Suffice it to say that this is causing the pain. As for suggesting treatment, I would need to do a full neurological workup and then start you on pain medications like Neurontin for a while and evaluate your response to that. You must discuss this with your physician and then follow up with him. If the pain gets too severe, you could try physical therapies like Interferential therapy which will give you a temporary pain relief while you wait for the pain medications to have their effect.

No other options....oh of course, there are pain medications but these are poorly effective to PREVENT pain and really not designed for that purpose so you'd have to take a lot of drugs on a constant basis that could affect you in other unwanted ways.

This pain seems to come and go.  If this is gas, what can I take to relieve the bloating and pain?","Doctor":"Hello dear,The symptoms as mentioned in your post is attributed to accumulation of gas secondary to increased acid production in the stomach.Symptomatic relief can be obtained with intake of Pantoprazole preparation (to be taken twice a day before meals) & antacid gel (to be taken after meals).They prevent formation of excess acid in the stomach & provide symptomatic relief.And it is also needed that you take certain precautions regarding your diet & lifestyle, such as:1. Take soft, plain, non-spicy foods2. Drink lots of water to maintain adequate hydration3. Avoid fast foods & gas producing food products like cabbage, etc.4. Avoid smoking & alcohol.5. Keep away stress, think positive.If symptoms still persist, kindly consult a Gastroenterologist for proper clinical examination.An Ultrasound scan of Abdomen & Pelvis will be helpful.There is no need to worry, you will be fine.Wishing a good health.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello, I am a 29 year old female who had a brain MRI without contrast done.

Your husband of 82 years age has pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, emphysema and diaphragmatic paralysis. He is having severe pulsatile headache in episodes. As he is 82 years old and have chronic respiratory illness so his headache should be evaluated and investigated properly. If headache is very severe he should undergo MR imaging to rule out any vascular lesions though as symptoms are occurring in episodes so possibility is very unlikely. If his examination comes normal then for headache he can be given OTC analgesics like Paracetamol. Common medicines like Amitryptiline, Sodium Valproate can be used to relieve his headache. Medicines like beta blockers as Propranolol should be avoided because it may further aggravate the asthma.

Your symptoms are not suggestive of a cardiac problem or heart attack.Your blood pressure is dropping when you stand because you are likely volume depleted.  Please tank up with good 'ole fresh water...no need for electrolytes or anything fancy....just water.  Also, if you're not eating well these last couple of days try at least to get soft food, pudding, or chicken broth down the pipe.
