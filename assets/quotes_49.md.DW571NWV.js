We start by noting that the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers (6^6), (8^8), and (k) must be (12^{12}). We need to find the values of (k) such that this condition holds.2. First, we express each number in terms of its prime factorization:   [   6^6 = (2 cdot 3)^6 = 2^6 cdot 3^6   ]   [   8^8 = (2^3)^8 = 2^{24}   ]   [   12^{12} = (2^2 cdot 3)^12 = 2^{24} cdot 3^{12}   ]3. Let (k) be expressed in terms of its prime factors as (k = 2^a cdot 3^b), where (a) and (b) are non-negative integers.4. The LCM of (6^6), (8^8), and (k) is given by:   [   text{LCM}(6^6, 8^8, k) = text{LCM}(2^6 cdot 3^6, 2^{24}, 2^a cdot 3^b)   ]5. The LCM of several numbers is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in any of the factorizations. Therefore:   [   text{LCM}(2^6 cdot 3^6, 2^{24}, 2^a cdot 3^b) = 2^{max(6, 24, a)} cdot 3^{max(6, 0, b)}   ]6. For the LCM to be equal to (12^{12} = 2^{24} cdot 3^{12}), we must have:   [   2^{max(6, 24, a)} = 2^{24} quad text{and} quad 3^{max(6, 0, b)} = 3^{12}   ]7. From (2^{max(6, 24, a)} = 2^{24}), it follows that:   [   max(6, 24, a) = 24 implies a leq 24   ]8. From (3^{max(6, 0, b)} = 3^{12}), it follows that:   [   max(6, 0, b) = 12 implies b = 12   ]9. Therefore, (a) can take any integer value from (0) to (24), inclusive. This gives us (25) possible values for (a).10.

Restate the problem with generalization:   We need to find the smallest real number ( M ) such that for any positive real numbers ( a, b, c ) with ( abc = 2024 ), the inequality ({a} + {b} + {c} leq M) holds. Here, ({x}) denotes the fractional part of ( x ).2. Generalize the problem:   Replace ( 2024 ) with ( n ). We claim that the answer is ( M = 2 + frac{n}{n+1} ).3. Construct an example to show necessity:   Consider ( a = 1 - varepsilon ), ( b = n + 1 - varepsilon ), and ( c = frac{n}{ab} approx frac{n}{n+1} ) for (varepsilon > 0) sufficiently small.    - Here, ({a} approx 1 - varepsilon), ({b} approx 1 - varepsilon), and ({c} approx frac{n}{n+1}).   - Therefore, ({a} + {b} + {c} approx 2 - 2varepsilon + frac{n}{n+1}).   - As (varepsilon to 0), ({a} + {b} + {c} to 2 + frac{n}{n+1}).   This shows that ( M geq 2 + frac{n}{n+1} ) is necessary.4. Prove the sufficiency:   We need to show that ({a} + {b} + {c} leq 2 + frac{n}{n+1}) for any ( a, b, c ) with ( abc = n ).   - Consider the function ( f(a, b, c) = {a} + {b} + {c} ).   - Note that ({x} = x - lfloor x rfloor), so ( f(a, b, c) = a - lfloor a rfloor + b - lfloor b rfloor + c - lfloor c rfloor ).   - Since ( abc = n ), we have ( c = frac{n}{ab} ).   - The function ( f(a, b, c) = a + b + frac{n}{ab} - (lfloor a rfloor + lfloor b rfloor + lfloor frac{n}{ab} rfloor) ) is convex in each of ( a ) and ( b ).5. Convexity and shifting variables:   - By convexity, we can shift two of the three variables until two of them are close to an integer.   - If one of them is close to an integer from above, the sum is (leq 2 + varepsilon < M).6. Case when two variables are close to an integer from below:   - Without loss of generality, let ( a = u - varepsilon ) and ( b = v - varepsilon ), where ( u ) and ( v ) are integers.   - Then ( c = frac{n}{uv} + varepsilon' ).   - The inequality holds with ( M = 2 + left{frac{n}{uv}right} leq 2 + frac{n}{n+1} ).

Solution: The gravitational force gives both bodies an equal vertical acceleration, and thus an equal vertical displacement, which does not affect the distance between the two bodies. Therefore, in our problem, we can neglect the gravitational force. Thus, we are examining the minimum distance between two bodies moving with speed c along the hypotenuse A H=p and the leg B H=q of the right triangle A B H (see figure).

In this case, x+y=p-q is constant.It is obvious that as long as x>0 and y>0, d decreases as t increases. When x leq 0 or y leq 0, d increases as t increases (beyond any limit), so the minimum can only occur when x>0 and y>0.In this case, by the cosine rule,begin{gathered}d^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}-2 x y cos left(90^{circ}+alpharight)=x^{2}+2 x y+y^{2}-2 x y+2 x y sin alpha= =(x+y)^{2}-2 x y(1-sin alpha)end{gathered}Since x+y is constant, d^{2} will be minimal (considering that 1-sin alpha>0) when x y is maximal. If the sum of two quantities is constant, their geometric mean is maximal when the two quantities are equal. Thus, x y is maximal when x=y, or x+y=2 x=p-q, i.e., x=y=frac{p-q}{2}.Now we can calculate the value of t_{0}, based on the fact that p-c t_{0}=c t_{0}-q, i.e., t_{0}=frac{p+q}{2 c}, but we will show that we can determine the value of d_{text {min }} without calculating t_{0}, which is different from the first solution.Indeed, from (1),begin{gathered}d_{min }^{2}=(p-q)^{2}-frac{(p-q)^{2}}{2}(1-sin alpha)=frac{(p-q)^{2}}{2}+frac{(p-q)^{2}}{2} sin alpha= =frac{(p-q)^{2}}{2}(1+sin alpha)end{gathered}Since p=frac{a}{cos alpha} and q=a operatorname{tg} alpha, we havep-q=frac{a}{cos alpha}-frac{a sin alpha}{cos alpha}=frac{a(1-sin alpha)}{cos alpha}and thus from (2),d_{min }^{2}=frac{a^{2}(1-sin alpha)^{2}}{2 cos ^{2} alpha}(1+sin alpha)=frac{a^{2}left(1-sin ^{2} alpharight)(1-sin alpha)}{2 cos ^{2} alpha}=frac{a^{2}(1-sin alpha)}{2}henced_{min }=a sqrt{frac{1-sin alpha}{2}}Bártfai Pál (Bp., I., Petőfi g.

Thus, the distance from the origin to line l is frac{|0 cdot costheta + 0 cdot sintheta - 1|}{sqrt{cos^2theta + sin^2theta}}, which simplifies to 1.Since |OP| is defined as the distance from the origin O to the point P(x,y), we have |OP| = sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.So we equate the two expressions for the distance:[sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 1]Squaring both sides of the equation to remove the square root yields the result:[x^2 + y^2 = 1]Therefore, the trajectory equation of point P is a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin.

Show that Luciana is correct, that is, find the number overline{a b c d e}.","solution":"SolutionEvery number divisible by 5 has the unit digit equal to 5 or equal to 0. Since the digit 0 was not used by Juarez, for overline{b c d} to be divisible by 5, we must necessarily have d=5.Every number divisible by 3 is such that the sum of its digits is also divisible by 3. Thus, since overline{c d e} is divisible by 3, we have that c+d+e is also divisible by 3. On the other hand, since d=5, then c and d are less than 5. Therefore, c+d+e is less than 15. Also, since c and d are greater than or equal to 1, c+d+e is also greater than 6. The only multiples of three that are greater than or equal to 6 and less than 15 are 9 and 12. Therefore, c+d+e can only take the values 9, 12. Using the fact again that d=5, we have that c+e can only take the values 4 or 7.Every number divisible by 4 that contains three or more digits is such that the number formed by its tens and units digits (in that order) is also divisible by 4. Thus, since overline{a b c} is divisible by 4, we have that the number overline{b c} is also divisible by 4. In particular, c must be even, since every number divisible by four is also even.Since c is even, then c=2 or c=4. We will now show that this implies that it cannot be the case that c+e is equal to 4. Indeed, if c=2, then for c+e to be equal to 4, we should have e=2, which would be impossible since e neq c. If c=4, then for c+e to be equal to 4, we should have e=0, which would also be impossible, since the digit 0 was not used by Juarez. Thus, we must have that c+d=7.So far we have discovered that:(1) c is even;(2) c+e=7(3) overline{b c} is divisible by 4.Since d=5, then e neq 5. Therefore, from item (2) above, we have that c neq 2. Therefore, the only even value possible for c is 4. We conclude that c=4 and e=3.The possible values left for b are 1 and 2. But, from item (3), we conclude that b=2 because if b=1, then overline{b c} would be equal to 14, which is not a multiple of 4. Finally, we have that a=1.

Gimn., II. o. t.)Note. In the problem statement, some may find the part \\"is there a smallest among the quotients obtained this way\\" somewhat strange, as we are accustomed to the fact that among given numbers, there is always a smallest. However, this is not always the case. For example, there is no smallest integer, rational number, or even real number. There is also no smallest positive rational number: for any positive rational number g, g / 2 is smaller and also a positive rational number. Similarly, if we consider the reciprocals of all natural numbers, there will be no smallest among the resulting quotients. Therefore, it was not superfluous to include this part in the question.But when can we be sure that there is a smallest among certain numbers, what tells us that in a set of numbers, there is definitely a smallest element? Well, this is indicated by the number of elements in the set, the cardinality of the set. If the set contains a finite number of numbers, that is, if we can count the numbers and say how many numbers are in the set (ten, a hundred, etc.), then there is definitely a smallest (and largest as well) among the numbers in the set. However, if the set contains an infinite number of numbers, then it is possible, but not certain, that there is a smallest among the numbers.We would like to draw attention to the fact that in mathematics, the word \\"infinite\\" is not always used in a finite sense. In the above example, a set is finite if we can count its constituent numbers and say how many elements the set contains. A set is infinite if we cannot count its constituent elements, as in the case of integers or real numbers."},{"problem":"Consider a function f(x) defined over mathbb{R} such that for any real number x, it satisfies f(x) = f(x - 2) + 3, and f(2) = 4.

To find the minimum value of a, we need to find the maximum value of f(x) on the given interval.First, let's analyze the monotonicity of f(x). Differentiate f(x) with respect to x: f'(x) = -frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2x^2} To determine where f'(x) = 0, solve the equation: -frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2x^2} = 0 quad Rightarrow quad frac{1}{2x^2} = frac{1}{2} This implies x^2 = 1 and x = pm 1.

Claim and Verification:   We claim that the least real number ( k ) such that the inequality holds for all real numbers ( a, b, c ) is ( boxed{k = 8} ). To verify, we check if the equality can be achieved when ( (a, b, c) = (4, 1, -2) ).2. Substitution and Simplification:   Let ( u = frac{2a}{a-b} ), ( v = frac{2b}{b-c} ), and ( w = frac{2c}{c-a} ). Note that ( (u-2)a = ub ), so ( prod_{text{cyc}}(u-2) = prod_{text{cyc}} u ) or ( abc = 0 ).3. Case Analysis:   - If ( abc = 0 ), without loss of generality, let ( a = 0 ). The original inequality becomes:     [     left(frac{b}{b-c} - 1right)^2 geq 0     ]     which is evidently true.   - If ( abc neq 0 ), the original inequality is equivalent to finding the smallest ( k ) such that:     [     f(u, v, w) = u^2 + v^2 + w^2 - 4(u + v + w) + k geq 0     ]     subject to:     [     g(u, v, w) := sum uv - 4sum u + 8 = 0     ]4. Function Analysis:   Note that:   [   u^2 + v^2 + w^2 - 4u - 4v - 4w + 8 = sum (u-2)^2 - 4 geq 0   ]   for all ( u, v, w ) such that one of ( |u|, |v|, |w| geq 10^{100} ). Therefore, we only consider ( (u, v, w) in [-10^{100}, 10^{100}]^3 ), which is compact. Thus, local minima of ( f ) must exist.5. Lagrange Multipliers:   To find the local minima, we use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We need to check the points ( x = (u, v, w) ) such that ( f'(x) = lambda g'(x) ) for some real number ( lambda ).6. Partial Derivatives:   Considering partial derivatives of ( f ) and ( g ) with respect to ( u ):   [   u - 2 = lambda (-v - w + 2)   ]   Similarly, differentiating with respect to ( v ) and ( w ) gives:   [   (u - v) = 0 quad text{if} quad lambda neq 1   ]   This implies ( u = v = w ), leading to:   [   u^3 = prod u = prod (u-2) = (u-2)^3 implies u = u-2   ]   which is a contradiction. Therefore, ( lambda = 1 ).7. Summation and Simplification:   Adding the expressions:   [   u - w = lambda (-v - w + 2)   ]   and symmetric expressions, we obtain:   [   sum u = frac{6(1 + lambda)}{1 + 2lambda} = 4   ]   Hence:   [   g(u, v, w) = 0 implies sum uv = 4   ]   Therefore:   [   f(x) = (sum u)^2 - 2sum uv - 4sum u + k = 16 - 2 cdot 4 - 4 cdot 4 + 8 = 0   ]   Thus, ( min f = 0 ), as desired.

Here are the steps we will take to enhance the solution:1. First, we will treat the two girls who must stand next to each other as a single entity. We need to determine how many different ways there are to arrange the two girls. Since the order matters (Girl A, then Girl B is different from Girl B, then Girl A), we have two factorial ways or 2! ways to arrange the girls.      This gives us 2! = 2 ways.2. Once we have treated the two girls as a single entity, we now have a total of three entities to arrange: the bundled girls and the two boys.3. The number of ways to arrange these three entities is given by 3! (three factorial) since each entity can be in any of the three positions and the order matters.   This gives us 3! = 3 times 2 times 1 = 6 ways.4.

We will follow the rounding steps in reverse to find the critical value ( M ).1. Final Rounding to Integer:   - For a grade to be rounded to at least 90, it must be at least 89.5 after the final rounding step. This is because 89.5 is the smallest number that rounds up to 90.2. Second Last Rounding:   - To ensure the grade is at least 89.5 after the final rounding, it must be at least 89.45 before the final rounding step. This is because 89.45 rounds to 89.5.3. Third Last Rounding:   - To ensure the grade is at least 89.45 after the second last rounding, it must be at least 89.445 before the second last rounding step. This is because 89.445 rounds to 89.45.4. Continuing the Process:   - We continue this process, each time adding another digit 4 to the end of the number. This leads to an infinite series of 4s in the decimal part.5. Infinite Series Representation:   - The number we are looking for is ( 89.overline{4} ), which is a repeating decimal. We can convert this repeating decimal to a fraction:     [     89.overline{4} = 89 + 0.overline{4}     ]     Let ( y = 0.overline{4} ). Then:     [     10y = 4.overline{4}     ]     Subtracting the original ( y ) from this equation:     [     10y - y = 4.overline{4} - 0.overline{4}     ]     [     9y = 4     ]     [     y = frac{4}{9}     ]     Therefore:     [     89.overline{4} = 89 + frac{4}{9} = frac{801}{9} + frac{4}{9} = frac{805}{9}     ]6. Simplifying the Fraction:   - The fraction (frac{805}{9}) is already in its simplest form because 805 and 9 are relatively prime (they have no common factors other than 1).7.

","solution":" Part (a)1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the least number ( m ) such that we can distribute ( m ) candies among ( n ) students arranged in a circle, ensuring that the configuration is balanced. A configuration is balanced if for any student ( A_i ), there exists a regular polygon with ( A_i ) as one of its vertices, and all students at the vertices of this polygon have an equal number of candies.2. Initial Distribution:   Consider giving each student exactly 1 candy. This means ( m = n ).3. Verification:   - Each student ( A_i ) has 1 candy.   - For any regular polygon with ( k ) vertices (where ( k ) divides ( n )), each vertex will have 1 candy.   - Since all students have the same number of candies, the configuration is balanced.Thus, the least ( m ) such that we can create a balanced configuration is ( m = n ). Part (b)1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to prove that if ( n ) is the product of at most 2 prime numbers and ( m geq n ), then no matter how we distribute the candies initially, we can always reach a balanced configuration after a finite number of moves. A move consists of a student giving a candy to a neighboring student who has fewer candies.2. Prime Factorization:   Let ( n = p_1 cdot p_2 ) where ( p_1 ) and ( p_2 ) are prime numbers (or ( n = p_1 ) if ( n ) is a single prime).3. Invariant and Convergence:   - Define the \\"imbalance\\" of the configuration as the sum of the absolute differences in the number of candies between neighboring students.   - Each move reduces the imbalance because a candy is transferred from a student with more candies to a student with fewer candies.   - Since the total number of candies ( m ) is fixed and ( m geq n ), the imbalance will eventually reach zero, leading to a balanced configuration.4. Regular Polygons:   - For ( n = p_1 cdot p_2 ), consider the regular polygons with ( p_1 ) and ( p_2 ) vertices.   - The balancing process ensures that the candies are distributed evenly among the vertices of these polygons.5. Finite Moves:   - Since each move reduces the imbalance and the imbalance is a non-negative integer, the process will terminate after a finite number of moves.Thus, we have shown that for ( n ) being the product of at most 2 prime numbers and ( m geq n ), a balanced configuration can always be achieved after a finite number of moves.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ m = n } )"},{"problem":"## Problem StatementCalculate the volumes of the bodies bounded by the surfaces.frac{x^{2}}{16}+frac{y^{2}}{9}+frac{z^{2}}{196}=1, z=7, z=0","solution":"## SolutionIn the section of the given figure by the plane z= const, there is an ellipse:frac{x^{2}}{16}+frac{y^{2}}{9}=frac{196-z^{2}}{196}The area of an ellipse with radii a and b is pi cdot a cdot bBy the definition of the radius of an ellipse:begin{aligned}& frac{x^{2}}{16 cdot frac{196-z^{2}}{196}}+frac{y^{2}}{9 cdot frac{196-z^{2}}{196}}=1 rightarrow a=frac{2}{7} sqrt{196-z^{2}} ; b=frac{3}{14} sqrt{196-z^{2}} & Rightarrow S=pi a b=pi cdot frac{2}{7} sqrt{196-z^{2}} cdot frac{3}{14} sqrt{196-z^{2}}=frac{3 pi}{49} cdotleft(196-z^{2}right) & V=int_{0}^{7} S(z) d z=frac{3 pi}{49} int_{0}^{7}left(196-z^{2}right) d z=left.frac{3 pi}{49}left(196 z-frac{z^{3}}{3}right)right|_{0} ^{7}= & =frac{3 pi}{49}left(196 cdot 7-frac{7^{3}}{3}-196 cdot 0+frac{0^{3}}{3}right)=frac{pi}{49}left(3 cdot 1372-3 cdot frac{343}{3}right)=frac{3773 cdot pi}{49}=77 piend{aligned}Source — «http://pluspi.org/wiki/index.php/������������_ %D0%9A%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%BE%D0%B2_%D0%98%D0%BD%D1%82 % mathrm{D} 0 % mathrm{~B} 5 % mathrm{D} 0 % mathrm{~B} 3 % mathrm{D} 1 % 80 % mathrm{D} 0 % mathrm{~B} 0 % mathrm{D} 0 % mathrm{BB} % mathrm{D} 1 % 8 mathrm{~B}+20-31 » Categories: Kuznetsov's Problem Book Integrals Problem 20 mid Integrals- Last edited on this page: 10:55, 22 June 2010.- Content is available under CC-BY-SA 3.0."},{"problem":"Given points A, B, and C that are not collinear, and O is any point outside the plane.

From the fact that in each of these squares, two kings cannot be placed without threatening each other, it follows that the sought number of kings cannot exceed ( k^2 ).

From this, it follows that for even ( n ), the maximum number of kings sought is (frac{n^2}{4}).Now let the number ( n ) be odd: ( n = 2k + 1 ). Divide the board into[left(frac{n+1}{2}right)^2 = (k+1)^2]smaller parts as indicated in Fig. 45, b (with such a division, we get ( k^2 ) squares consisting of four cells, ( 2k ) rectangles consisting of two cells, and one small square of one cell, i.e., a total of ( k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k+1)^2 ) parts). It is clear that in each of these parts, no more than one king can be placed (if it is required that the kings do not threaten each other). Therefore, the total number of kings cannot exceed ((k+1)^2). But ((k+1)^2) kings can be placed, as seen in Fig. 45, b, where ( k = 4 ). Therefore, the maximum number of kings sought is[(k+1)^2 = frac{(n+1)^2}{4}.]Using the notation for the integer part introduced on page 13, the results for the cases of even and odd ( n ) can be combined: the maximum number of kings that can be placed on a board of ( n^2 ) cells so that no two of them threaten each other is (left[frac{n+1}{2}right]^2).Remark. From the consideration of Fig. 45, b, it is not difficult to conclude that for odd ( n ), there is a unique arrangement of (frac{(n+1)^2}{4}) kings on an ( n^2 )-cell board, in which no two kings threaten each other. For even ( n ) (in particular, for ( n = 8 )), the maximum possible number of kings that do not threaten each other can be placed on the board in many different ways.

Substitute the values into the given expression: We are asked to find the value of frac{m+n}{m^2-2m}.

Point of Intersection## of a Line and a PlanePROBLEM STATEMENT. Find the point of intersection of the linefrac{x-x_{1}}{l}=frac{y-y_{1}}{m}=frac{z-z_{1}}{n}and the planeA x+B y+C z+D=0SOLUTION PLAN.1. Check that the line is not parallel to the plane. This means that the direction vector of the line vec{a}={l, m, n} and the normal vector of the plane vec{n}={A, B, C} are not orthogonal, i.e., their dot product is not zero:A l+B m+C n neq 0In this case, there is a unique point of intersection of the line and the plane.2. To find the point of intersection of the line and the plane, in general, we need to solve a system of three equations with three unknowns (two equations of the line and one equation of the plane). However, it is more convenient to use the parametric equations of the line.Letfrac{x-x_{1}}{l}=frac{y-y_{1}}{m}=frac{z-z_{1}}{n}=tThen the parametric equations of the line areleft{begin{array}{l}x=l t+x_{1} y=m t+y_{1} z=n t+z_{1}end{array}right.3. Substituting these expressions for x, y and z into the equation of the plane and solving it for t, we find the value of the parameter t=t_{0} at which the line and the plane intersect.4. Substituting the found value t_{0} into the parametric equations of the line, we get the desired coordinates of the point of intersection:left{begin{array}{l}x_{0}=l t_{0}+x_{1} y_{0}=m t_{0}+y_{1} z_{0}=n t_{0}+z_{1}end{array}right.We write the answer in the form: the line and the plane intersect at the point left(x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0}right)."},{"problem":"17.

WLOG, say that 0 is red (we'll multiply by 2 in the end). Then 1 must be blue because (0,0,1) can't be monochromatic. 2 must be red because (1,2,2) can't be monochromatic. Then we have two cases for what 3 is:Case 1: 3 is red. Then 4 is blue because (2,3,4) can't be monochromatic. This makes 5 red because (4,5,1) can't be monochromatic. Finally, 6 must be blue because (6,0,5) can't be monochromatic. This gives a single consistent coloring for this case.Case 2: 3 is blue. 4 can't also be blue because this would imply that 5 is red (because of (4,5,1) ) and 6 is red (because of (3,4,6) ), which would make (6,0,5) all red. So 4 must be red. Then we have two possibilities: either 5 is red and 6 is blue, or 5 is blue and 6 is red ( 5 and 6 can't both be red because of (6,0,5), and they can't both be blue because of (5,6,3)). These give two consistent colorings for this case.Overall, we have three consistent colorings: RBRRBRB, RBRBRRB, and RBRBRBR.

Consider the case when p+q=t+1. By the lemma, assume there exists a column that does not contain a cell that is bad in the column but good in the row. Removing this column results in a p row by q-1 column chessboard. Since p+q-1=t, this chessboard has at least (p-m)(q-1-n) bad cells.

It permeates our primary and secondary school mathematics textbooks, among which the parity of integers is also part of the study of number theory. The properties of operations between even and odd numbers are as follows: odd pm odd = even; even pm even = even; odd pm even = odd; odd times odd = odd; even times even = even; odd times even = even. There is a problem about polynomial operations: Given that a, b, c are natural numbers, such that (a^{b}-b^{c})(b^{c}-c^{a})(c^{a}-a^{b})=11713, find the values of a, b, c. Xiao Ming analyzed using the parity of integers and came to the following conclusions: ① To make the equation hold, the factors (a^{b}-b^{c}), (b^{c}-c^{a}), (c^{a}-a^{b}) must all be odd numbers; ② One set of solutions for a, b, c can be found; ③ Six sets of solutions for a, b, c can be found; ④ There are no natural numbers a, b, c that satisfy the conditions. The number of correct conclusions is ( ).A: 1B: 2C: 3D: 4","solution":"Given that (a^{b}-b^{c})(b^{c}-c^{a})(c^{a}-a^{b})=11713, we start by analyzing the properties of the equation and the number 11713.1. Factoring 11713 gives us 11713=13times 17times 53. This is our first step in understanding the prime factorization of the product on the left-hand side of the equation.2. Observing the sum of the terms a^{b}-b^{c}+b^{c}-c^{a}+c^{a}-a^{b}=0, we note that this sum equals zero, which is an important property because it suggests a balance or cancellation among the terms.3. For the product (a^{b}-b^{c})(b^{c}-c^{a})(c^{a}-a^{b}) to equal 11713, an odd number, each factor (a^{b}-b^{c}), (b^{c}-c^{a}), (c^{a}-a^{b}) must be odd. This is because the product of odd numbers is odd, and the product of an even number with any number is even. Since 11713 is odd, all factors must be odd.4. Given the odd nature of each factor and the fact that their sum is zero, we analyze the possibility of their signs. For the equation to hold true with odd factors resulting in an odd product, we consider the combination of signs. The analysis shows that there must be two negative and one positive factor or two positive and one negative factor among them to satisfy the given equation.5. However, when we try to match the specific values -13, -17, and 53 (or any permutation involving these values and their signs) to the factors, we find that no combination results in a sum of zero, which contradicts the initial condition a^{b}-b^{c}+b^{c}-c^{a}+c^{a}-a^{b}=0.6. This contradiction leads to the conclusion that there are no natural numbers a, b, c that satisfy the given conditions, making conclusion ④ correct.7. Conclusion ① is also correct because for the product to be odd, as analyzed, each factor must indeed be odd.Therefore, the correct conclusions are ① and ④, which means the number of correct conclusions is 2.Thus, the answer is: boxed{B}."},{"problem":"Example: How many types of isosceles triangles with integer side lengths and a perimeter of 100 are there?(8th \\"Hua Luogeng Cup\\" Junior Mathematics Invitational Final)","solution":"Let a, b, and c be the lengths of the three sides of a triangle.(1) a=ba .end{array}right.,Solving, we get 25<a<33 frac{1}{3}.Therefore, there are 8 possibilities.(2) a<b=c.In this case, a=100-2 c.Thus, left{begin{array}{l}100-2 c<c  1+2 c leqslant 100end{array}right..Solving, we get 33 frac{1}{3}<c leqslant 49 frac{1}{2}.Therefore, there are 16 possibilities.In total, there are 24 possibilities."},{"problem":"9.

Graph Interpretation and Degree Analysis:   - Consider a directed graph where each vertex represents a kid, and a directed edge from vertex ( A ) to vertex ( B ) indicates that kid ( A ) has sent a message to kid ( B ).   - Given that for each pair of kids, at least one has sent a message to the other, the graph is complete in the sense that there is a directed edge in at least one direction for every pair of vertices.   - For each kid ( A ), among the kids to whom ( A ) has sent a message, exactly ( 25% ) have sent a message back to ( A ).2. Degree Conditions:   - Let ( d_i ) be the out-degree of the ( i )-th vertex (kid). Then, the number of kids to whom ( A ) has sent a message is ( d_i ).   - According to the problem, ( 25% ) of these ( d_i ) kids have sent a message back to ( A ). Therefore, the number of kids who have sent a message back to ( A ) is ( frac{d_i}{4} ).3. Sum of Degrees:   - The sum of the out-degrees of all vertices is equal to the sum of the in-degrees of all vertices. This is a fundamental property of directed graphs.   - Let ( n ) be the total number of kids. The total number of directed edges in the graph is ( n(n-1) ) because each kid sends a message to ( n-1 ) other kids.   - Therefore, the sum of the out-degrees is ( sum_{i=1}^n d_i = n(n-1) ).4. Equating In-Degrees and Out-Degrees:   - The in-degree of the ( i )-th vertex is given by ( (n-1 - d_i) + frac{d_i}{4} ) because ( n-1 - d_i ) kids have not received a message from ( A ), and ( frac{d_i}{4} ) kids have sent a message back to ( A ).   - Summing over all vertices, we get:     [     sum_{i=1}^n d_i = sum_{i=1}^n left( (n-1 - d_i) + frac{d_i}{4} right)     ]   - Simplifying, we get:     [     sum_{i=1}^n d_i = n(n-1) - sum_{i=1}^n d_i + frac{1}{4} sum_{i=1}^n d_i     ]     [     sum_{i=1}^n d_i = n(n-1) - sum_{i=1}^n d_i + frac{1}{4} sum_{i=1}^n d_i     ]     [     sum_{i=1}^n d_i = n(n-1) - frac{3}{4} sum_{i=1}^n d_i     ]     [     frac{7}{4} sum_{i=1}^n d_i = n(n-1)     ]     [     7 sum_{i=1}^n d_i = 4n(n-1)     ]     [     sum_{i=1}^n d_i = frac{4n(n-1)}{7}     ]5. Divisibility Condition:   - For ( sum_{i=1}^n d_i ) to be an integer, ( frac{4n(n-1)}{7} ) must be an integer.   - This implies that ( 7 ) must divide ( n(n-1) ). Therefore, ( n ) must be congruent to ( 0 ) or ( 1 ) modulo ( 7 ).6. Possible Values of ( n ):   - We need to find the two-digit values of ( n ) that satisfy ( n equiv 0 pmod{7} ) or ( n equiv 1 pmod{7} ).   - The two-digit values of ( n ) that satisfy ( n equiv 0 pmod{7} ) are: ( 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98 ).   - The two-digit values of ( n ) that satisfy ( n equiv 1 pmod{7} ) are: ( 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, 64, 71, 78, 85, 92, 99 ).7.

Evaluation. On one vertical, there can be no more than two vertically jumping fleas (otherwise, the fleas located on the same-colored fields in a chessboard coloring would meet). The same is true for the horizontals. Therefore, on 20 horizontals and verticals, there can be no more than 40 fleas.Example. It is clear that fleas from different-colored fields cannot meet. Therefore, it is sufficient to indicate only 20 \\"white\\" fleas (the arrangement of the \\"black\\" fleas is symmetrical). This is shown in the drawing on the left. The arrow indicates the initial position of the flea and the direction of its movement.In the middle drawing, one \\"vertical\\" flea B and all the prohibited positions of the horizontal fleas (i.e., those that can end up in the same field as B) are indicated. As we see, the prohibited arrows lie only in the fields of the diagonals passing through B and in the diagonal rectangle defined by the smaller diagonal. The situation is essentially the same for the other vertical fleas from the first drawing; all the prohibited fields from them are shown in the drawing on the right. We see that the horizontal fleas from the first drawing are in one-sided prohibited fields and are in the opposite direction of the prohibited one.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_03_376d2fa4074cfcd15764g-3.jpg?height=526&width=1564&top_left_y=1483&top_left_x=262)"},{"problem":"8、Given the sequence left{a_{n}right} satisfies a_{n}=n(1 leq n leq 5), a_{n+1}=a_{1} cdot a_{2} cdot ldots cdot a_{n}-1(n geq 5), then S_{m}=a_{1} cdot a_{2} cdot ldots cdot a_{m}-a_{1}^{2}-a_{2}^{2}-ldots-a_{m}^{2} takes the maximum value as qquadGiven the sequence {a_n} satisfies a_n = n (1 leq n leq 5), a_{n+1} = a_1 cdot a_2 cdot ldots cdot a_n - 1 (n geq 5), then S_m = a_1 cdot a_2 cdot ldots cdot a_m - a_1^2 - a_2^2 - ldots - a_m^2 takes the maximum value as qquad","solution":"8.65Analysis: It is easy to know that S_{1}=0, S_{2}=-3, S_{3}=-8, S_{4}=-6, S_{5}=65, when m geq 5,begin{aligned}S_{m+1}-S_{m}=a_{1} a_{2} ldots a_{m+1} & -a_{1} a_{2} ldots a_{m}-a_{m+1}^{2}=a_{1} a_{2} ldots a_{m}left(a_{m+1}-1right)-a_{m+1}^{2} & =left(a_{m+1}+1right)left(a_{m+1}-1right)-a_{m+1}^{2}=-1end{aligned}Therefore, when m geq 5, S_{m}=70-m, thus the maximum term in the sequence left{S_{m}right} is 65."},{"problem":"6.

Similarly, if we replace the numbers a, b, c with their opposites. This fact will facilitate the following case analysis.Assume, then, that the numbers a, b, c are such that all three considered fractions have integer values. If any of them is zero, it suffices to consider the case a=0 without loss of generality. Substituting into the considered fractions, we get that the fractions b / c and c / b have integer values. Hence, b and c are non-zero and |b| geq |c| and simultaneously |c| geq |b|, so c = pm b. Additionally, the number b+c is the denominator of the first fraction, so b+c neq 0, thus b=c. Overall, we get (obviously valid) triplets (0, c, c) and their permutations for any non-zero integer c.It remains to solve the case where a b c neq 0.Given the observation from the first paragraph, we will assume that at least two of the numbers a, b, c are positive. If all three were positive, the fraction with the smallest of the numbers a, b, c in the numerator would lie between 0 and 1, so it could not have an integer value.Let, then, a, b be positive numbers and c=-d for a positive d. Substituting into the problem, we get that the fractionsfrac{a}{d-b}, quad frac{b}{d-a}, quad frac{d}{a+b}have integer values. From the last one, it is clear that d geq a+b. Therefore, the first fraction has a positive denominator, and since its value is an integer, it must be a geq d-b or d leq a+b. Thus, d=a+b or c=-a-b, and we get, in summary, triplets (a, b, c) of non-zero numbers for which a+b+c=0. All such triplets satisfy the condition, as the value of all three considered fractions is -1 for them.Answer. The problem is satisfied by all triplets (0, c, c), (c, 0, c), and (c, c, 0), where c is a non-zero integer, and all triplets (a, b, c) of non-zero integers for which a+b+c=0.For a complete solution, award 6 points. If any of the valid triplets is missing (e.g., another permutation of the triplet (0, c, c) is not mentioned), award no more than 5 points. Incomplete solution: for a complete solution of the case where one of the numbers a, b, c is 0, award 2 points; for solving the case where a, b, c are non-zero, award 4 points, of which 1 point for merely excluding the cases where all numbers a, b, c are positive or negative. For the observation in the first paragraph about permutations of triplets and changes in signs, if it does not lead to solving one of the two mentioned cases, do not award points.

Let f(x, y)=3 x^{2} y-2 x y^{2}, then f(x, y)=x y(3 x-2 y). The obtained expression equals 0 when x=0, or y=0, or y=frac{3}{2} x. Therefore, in the region 0 leq x, y leq 1, the function f(x, y) is positive below (or to the right of) the line y=frac{3}{2} x and reaches its maximum here, and it is negative above (or to the left of) this line and reaches its minimum here. In the first case, due to the inequality x leq 1 and the positivity of the expression in parentheses, we get f(x, y)=x y(3 x-2 y) leq y(3-2 y)=3 y-2 y^{2}. The maximum of this quadratic trinomial is achieved at y=frac{3}{4}, x=1 and is equal to frac{9}{8}, which gives the maximum value of the expression from the condition.In the second case, due to the inequality y leq 1 and the negativity of the expression in parentheses, we get f(x, y)=x y(3 x-2 y) geq x(3 x-2)=3 x^{2}-2 x.

Understanding the Problem:   We have 18 teams, and in each round, they are divided into 9 pairs to play 9 matches. There are 17 rounds in total, and each pair of teams plays exactly once. We need to find the maximum value of ( n ) such that after ( n ) rounds, there always exist 4 teams with exactly one match played between them.2. Graph Representation:   Represent the teams as vertices of a graph ( G ) with 18 vertices. Each match corresponds to an edge between two vertices. After 17 rounds, the graph ( G ) is a complete graph ( K_{18} ).3. Subgraph Analysis:   We need to find the maximum ( n ) such that in the graph formed after ( n ) rounds, there always exists a subset of 4 vertices with exactly one edge among them. This is equivalent to finding a subgraph ( R subset G ) with ( |R| = 4 ) and exactly one edge.4.

For divisibility by 11, it is significant on which positions the replaceable digits stand.First case. We replace two zeros in positions of the same parity (both even or both odd). For divisibility by 11, the sum of the two new digits must be divisible by 11, and since each digit is within [1;9], the sum must be 11. Note that divisibility by 3 is automatically satisfied (the sum of the digits of the number is 10+11=21). The following pairs of digits fit: 2--9,3--8,4--7, 5 - -6. Let's count the number of ways to perform the replacement. First, we choose one of these four pairs of digits (4 ways), then place the smaller digit in the place of any zero (80 ways); finally, place the larger digit in the same parity position (39 ways) - in total, we get 4 cdot 80 cdot 39=12480 ways.Second case. We replace two zeros in positions of different parity. Then, for divisibility by 11, these digits must be the same (denote each by k), and for divisibility by 3, 10+2 k vdots 3 must hold. This condition is satisfied by k=1, k=4, and k=7. Such a replacement can be made in 3 cdot 40 cdot 40=4800 ways (choose one of the three digits, and then one of fifty even positions and one of fifty odd positions).In total, we get 12480+4800=17280 ways."},{"problem":"A certain supermarket plans to order a type of yogurt monthly, with the same daily purchase quantity. The cost of purchasing each bottle is 4, and the selling price is 6. Unsold yogurt is sold at a reduced price of 2 per bottle on the same day.

If the highest temperature is not less than 25 degrees, the demand is 500 bottles; if the highest temperature is in the range [20, 25), the demand is 300 bottles; if the highest temperature is less than 20, the demand is 200 bottles.

The general formula for factoring a difference of squares is A^2 - B^2 = (A + B)(A - B). Applying this to our expression, we have:- A = a and B = 5, since a^2 = A^2 and 25 = B^2.- Therefore, a^{2}-25 = (a + 5)(a - 5).So, the factorization of a^{2}-25 is boxed{(a+5)(a-5)}. Problem 2: Factorization of 2x^{2}y-8xy+8yFirst, we factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) from each term in the expression. The GCF of 2x^{2}y, -8xy, and 8y is 2y.

The general form of a perfect square trinomial is A^2 - 2AB + B^2 = (A - B)^2. In our case, A = x and B = 2, since x^2 = A^2, -4x = -2AB, and 4 = B^2. Therefore, we have:- x^{2}-4x+4 = (x-2)^{2}.Substituting this back into our expression, we get:- 2y(x^{2}-4x+4) = 2y(x-2)^{2}.Thus, the factorization of 2x^{2}y-8xy+8y is boxed{2y(x-2)^{2}}."},{"problem":"If the one-variable quadratic equation x^{2}+2x+k=0 has two distinct real roots with respect to x, then the range of real number k is ______.","solution":"To determine the range of the real number k for which the quadratic equation x^{2}+2x+k=0 has two distinct real roots, we need to analyze the discriminant Delta of the equation.

We need to find all positive integers ( n ) such that there exists a polynomial ( f(x) ) of degree ( n ) satisfying this functional equation.2. Odd Polynomial Case:   Suppose ( f(x) ) is an odd polynomial. Then we can write ( f(x) = xg(x^2) ) for some polynomial ( g(x) ). Substituting this into the functional equation, we get:   [   f(x^2 + 1) = (x^2 + 1)g((x^2 + 1)^2)   ]   and   [   f(x)^2 + 1 = (xg(x^2))^2 + 1 = x^2g(x^2)^2 + 1.   ]   Equating these, we have:   [   (x^2 + 1)g((x^2 + 1)^2) = x^2g(x^2)^2 + 1.   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   (x^2 + 1)g((x^2 + 1)^2) = x^2g(x^2)^2 + 1.   ]   Setting ( x = 0 ), we get:   [   g(1) = 1.   ]   Setting ( x = 1 ), we get:   [   g(4) = 1.   ]   Setting ( x = 2 ), we get:   [   g(25) = 1.   ]   Since ( g(x) = 1 ) for infinitely many values of ( x ), we conclude that ( g(x) = 1 ) for all ( x ).

Prove that we cannot cut more than 2500 trees:   - Consider the square grid of trees with coordinates ranging from ((0,0)) to ((99,99)).   - Divide this grid into (2500) smaller squares, each of size (2 times 2). Each smaller square contains four points: ((2i, 2j)), ((2i+1, 2j)), ((2i, 2j+1)), and ((2i+1, 2j+1)) for (0 leq i, j leq 49).   - Within each (2 times 2) square, any tree stump can see the other three tree stumps. Therefore, at most one tree in each (2 times 2) square can be cut down to ensure that no two stumps can see each other.   - Since there are (2500) such (2 times 2) squares, the maximum number of trees that can be cut down is (2500).2. Prove that we can cut down 2500 trees:   - We will show that it is possible to cut down all trees with even-numbered coordinates without violating the condition.   - Consider the trees at coordinates ((2i, 2j)) for (0 leq i, j leq 49). These are the bottom-left trees in each (2 times 2) square.   - We need to prove that no two stumps at these coordinates can see each other. Consider two such points (P = (2a, 2b)) and (Q = (2c, 2d)) where (a, b, c, d in {0, 1, ldots, 49}) and ((a, b) neq (c, d)).   - The line segment (PQ) must contain at least one lattice point with at least one odd coordinate to ensure that no two stumps can see each other.   - The midpoint of (PQ) is (left(frac{2a + 2c}{2}, frac{2b + 2d}{2}right) = (a + c, b + d)). Since (a neq c) or (b neq d), at least one of (a + c) or (b + d) is odd, ensuring that the midpoint is not a point with even coordinates.   - Therefore, the segment (PQ) contains a point with at least one odd coordinate, ensuring that no two stumps can see each other.Thus, it is possible to cut down exactly (2500) trees such that no two stumps can see each other.The final answer is (boxed{2500})"},{"problem":"If a and b are positive numbers, and they satisfy 12345 = (111 + a)(111 - b), then the relationship between a and b is (　　)A: a > bB: a = bC: a < bD: Cannot be determined","solution":"Given 12345 = (111 + a)(111 - b),  we have 12345 = 12321 + 111(a - b) - ab.

On the other hand, the total number of three-element subsets of S that contain a is C_{11}^{2}=91. By (iii), each of these subsets is contained in some set A_{i} in the family A, so 15 cdot d(a) geqslant 91, d(a) geqslant 7.Now, we calculate the total number of elements in all sets of the family A in two ways, and we getn times 7=sum_{k=1}^{n}left|A_{k}right|=sum_{a in S} d(a) geqslant 15 times 7, n geqslant 15 .Next, we construct a specific family of sets A=left{A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{15}right} that meets the conditions of the problem.First, we mark the 15 elements of S={1,2, cdots, 15} in a clockwise direction on 15 equally spaced points on a circle (as shown in Figure (a)).We define A_{1}={1,2,4,5,6,11,13}, and denote the 7-element subset of S obtained by rotating A_{1} clockwise by j-1 arc segments as A_{j}(j=2,3, cdots, 15).

Each A_{i} has the same property. Rotating A_{i} clockwise by j-i arc segments (1 leqslant j-i leqslant 7), exactly three elements of A_{i} will move to positions marked by elements that are still in A_{i}, so left|A_{i} cap A_{j}right|=3.If 8 leqslant j-i leqslant 14, then rotating A_{j} clockwise by 15-(j-i) arc segments results in A_{i}.

If the number 2 is not a divisor of the number n, then the number 4 is not either, which is impossible. Therefore, the number 2 is also a divisor of the number n.1 pointNow we have two possibilities. The first possibility is that d_{1}=1, d_{2}=2, d_{3}=3, and d_{4}=5. Notice that in this case, the number 6 is also a divisor of n, so we conclude that d_{5}=6 must hold.From the second condition, we have that d_{7}=d_{5}^{2}+1=37, so the number n has at least 4 different prime factors (2,3,5,37), which means it has at least 16 divisors, which is a contradiction.The second possibility is that d_{1}=1, d_{2}=2, d_{3}=4, and d_{4}=5.

Since n is divisible by 4 and 5, the only possibility would be d_{6}=20.The divisors of the number n can be paired so that their product is equal to n, i.e., d_{i} cdot d_{13-i}=n, for each i in{1,2, ldots, 12}. In particular, it must be n=d_{6} cdot d_{7}=2020.It remains to verify that the number n=2020 indeed satisfies all the conditions of the problem, i.e., that there are no other divisors between 20 and 101 and that it has exactly 12 divisors in total. Both conditions can be easily verified by listing all the divisors of 2020.

In the opposite case, all three prime numbers p, q, r are greater than 3, and thus neither the product p q r, nor the right side of (1) are numbers divisible by three (the number 963 is, after all, a multiple of three). From the condition that the product (p+1)(q+1)(r+1) on the left side of (1) is not divisible by three, it follows that none of the prime numbers p, q, r can give a remainder of 2 when divided by three. And since a remainder of 0 is excluded in the considered case, the prime numbers p, q, r can only give a remainder of 1 when divided by three.

The degree of a monomial is the sum of the exponents of all its variables. Here, x has an exponent of 1, and y^2 has an exponent of 2, so the total degree is 1+2=3. Therefore, the correct statement should be that the coefficient is -frac{3}{4}, and the degree is 3. Since the original statement is incorrect, option A does not meet the requirements.Option B: The terms 5x^{2}y and -2yx^{2} are considered like terms because they contain the same variables raised to the same powers, just in a different order. The commutative property of multiplication allows us to rearrange the order of multiplication without changing the product, meaning x^{2}y is the same as yx^{2}. Therefore, the statement that they are not like terms is incorrect, making option B incorrect.Option C: The expression x^{2}+mx consists of two terms, not one, which contradicts the definition of a monomial as an expression with only one term. However, the statement to evaluate is if this expression can be considered a monomial, then m must be 0. This interpretation is incorrect because having m neq 0 does not make the expression a monomial; it remains a binomial regardless of the value of m. Therefore, the statement as given is misleading. However, following the original solution's logic, it suggests that under the assumption it's a monomial (which is a flawed premise), m would have to be 0 for it to revert to a single-term expression, which is not the correct interpretation of monomials. This option is incorrectly validated in the original solution.Option D: The number 0 is indeed considered a monomial. A monomial can be a single number (a constant), a variable, or several variables multiplied together. There is no restriction against the constant being 0. Therefore, the statement in option D is incorrect, making this option not meet the requirements.Given the analysis, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of option C in the original solution.

Since (1) states y=x+z, from this x=0. Therefore, the b_{i} sequence is 0,1,1,0,-1,-1,0,1,1,0, and the a_{i} sequence accordingly a_{i}=2^{b_{i}} is 1,2,2,1, frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{2}, 1,2,2,1.From the above, it follows that if the problem has a solution, then it can only be the found sequence. However, if the condition is satisfied for the (x ; y ; z) triplet, that is, x-y+z=0, then we get the (y ; z ;-x) triplet by shifting this triplet by one in the b_{i} sequence. Calculating the sum y-z+(-x), we get y-z-x=-(x-y+z)=0 as well.If, therefore, the second element is the sum of the first and the third, then according to the rule of forming the b_{i} sequence, every element is the sum of the two surrounding it, so our sequence is the only solution to the problem.Remark. This line of reasoning would be much less comprehensible in the language of products and quotients, but the transition to logarithms not only simplifies the solution typographically.

To find the critical points, we differentiate f(x):begin{align*}f'(x) &= x^2-1.end{align*}Setting f'(x)=0 gives us x^2-1=0, which implies x=pm1. The function is increasing on (-infty, -1), decreasing on (-1, 1), and increasing on (1, +infty). To find the maximum value, we evaluate f(x) at x=-1:begin{align*}f(-1) &= frac{1}{3}(-1)^3-(-1) &= -frac{1}{3}+1 &= frac{2}{3}.end{align*}Therefore, the statement in option A is incorrect because the maximum value is frac{2}{3}, not -frac{2}{3}.

Consider the following subsets of T:{1,5},{2,6},{3,7},{4,8},{5,9},{6,10},{7,11},{1,8},{2,9},{3,10},{4,11}.Clearly, each number in T belongs to exactly two of these 11 subsets. For any 6 numbers in T, they belong to exactly 12 of these subsets. By the pigeonhole principle, there must be two numbers that belong to the same subset, meaning their difference is 4 or 7. Therefore, no 6 numbers in T can all belong to S.On the other hand, in T^{prime}={1,3,4,6,9}, the difference between any two numbers is not 4 or 7, so they can all belong to the subset S. Hence, at most 5 numbers in T can belong to S.Since 1989=181 times 11-2, the number of elements in S does not exceed 905. Additionally, the set{1,3,4,6,9,12,14,15,17,20}has the property that the difference between any two numbers is not 4 or 7.

We start by using the identity sin^2 x = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2}cos 2x:begin{align*}f(x) &= frac{3}{2}sin 2x + sin^2 x      &= frac{3}{2}sin 2x + frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2}cos 2x      &= frac{sqrt{10}}{2}left(sin 2x cdot frac{3sqrt{10}}{10} - cos 2x cdot frac{sqrt{10}}{10}right) + frac{1}{2}.end{align*}Now, we use the sum-to-product identities to express the combination of sin 2x and cos 2x as a single sine function with a phase shift theta:begin{align*}sin(2x - theta) &= sin 2x cos theta - cos 2x sin theta, end{align*}where tan theta = frac{1}{3}, and 0 < theta < frac{pi}{2}.(1) The center of symmetry for the function is given by left(frac{kpi}{2} + frac{theta}{2}, 0right) for some integer k. Since tan frac{pi}{12} = 2 - sqrt{3}, statement (1) is incorrect.(2) The minimal positive period of the function is determined by the 2pi period of the sin and cos functions, but since f(x) has a factor of 2 multiplying x in sin 2x and cos 2x, the period is halved. Hence, the minimal positive period is pi, making statement (2) incorrect.(3) Since tan theta = frac{1}{3} < frac{sqrt{3}}{3} = tan frac{pi}{6}, we conclude that 0 < theta < frac{pi}{6}. Therefore, within the range - frac{pi}{4} + frac{theta}{2} < x < frac{pi}{4} + frac{theta}{2}, which is less than frac{pi}{3}, the function is decreasing. Therefore, on the interval left[frac{pi}{4} + frac{theta}{2}, frac{pi}{3}right], the function is decreasing and statement (3) is also incorrect.(4) For x = frac{pi}{3}, 2x + theta = frac{2pi}{3} + theta is not equal to kpi + frac{pi}{2} for any integer k. Therefore, statement (4) is incorrect.Thus, the correct answer is:[boxed{A}]Enhanced Solution Details:To prove statement (1), we could substitute (frac{pi}{12},0) into the function and check for symmetry, but the argument above using centers of symmetry for sine functions resolves it more effectively.Statement (2) is disproved by understanding the frequency of trigonometric functions, where multiplying the argument by a constant effectively changes the period.For (3), we analyze the monotonic behavior by considering when the derivative of f(x) (being the slope of the tangent line) changes sign. Alternatively, we understand the behavior of the sin function within certain intervals and apply the phase shift to determine the actual interval where the function is increasing or decreasing.As for (4), the symmetry property of the sine function around its axes is used to argue against the presence of an axis of symmetry at x = frac{pi}{3} for f(x).In this problem, we utilized properties of trigonometric functions and relationships between angles to evaluate the correctness of the statements."},{"problem":"A factory produces a certain type of component, and the inspector randomly selects 16 of these components from the production line each day to measure their dimensions (in cm).

Let point O lie inside triangle triangle A B C, and points A, B, C, O satisfy the condition of the problem. Then point O is the center of the circumcircle of triangle triangle A B C. Proof of the lemma. Consider triangle triangle A B C, by the condition of the problem it is isosceles. Suppose A B=B C, then note that B O<A B and B O<B C. By the condition of the problem, triangles triangle A B O and triangle B C O are isosceles, which means O B=O A and O B=O C. We have obtained that O A=O B=O C, so O is the center of the circumcircle of triangle triangle A B C.We will prove that k leq 1 by induction on n. If n=3, then all k points lie inside the triangle and by the lemma all coincide with the center of the circumcircle of this triangle. We get that k leq 1. If n geq 4, then in this n-gon there is a right or obtuse angle angle A_{mathrm{i}-1} A_{mathrm{i}} A_{mathrm{i}+1}. By the proved lemma, inside triangle A_{mathrm{i}-1} A_{mathrm{i}} A_{mathrm{i}+1} there cannot be any of the k points. Therefore, by cutting off triangle A_{mathrm{i}-1} A_{mathrm{i}} A_{mathrm{i}+1} from our polygon, we get an (n-1)-gon, inside which there are k points. By the induction hypothesis, k leq 1.

In Xiao Li's operation process, the first step involves finding a common denominator for the fractions frac{3x}{x-2} and frac{x}{x+2}. This is done by multiplying the numerator and denominator of each fraction by the missing factor from the other fraction's denominator, resulting in a common denominator of (x-2)(x+2).Therefore, the answer to part (1) is:boxed{text{one}} Part (2) - Identifying the ErrorUpon reviewing Xiao Li's steps, we notice that the error begins in Step 3. The mistake made is in the operation performed on the numerators after combining the fractions.

Notice that frac{(x+2)(x-2)}{x} is common in both terms, so we distribute it: =3left(frac{x(x+2)(x-2)}{x(x-2)}right)-left(frac{x(x+2)(x-2)}{x(x+2)}right)3. Simplify each term by canceling out common factors: =3(x+2)-(x-2)4. Expand and combine like terms: =3x+6-x+25.

Therefore, we will look for the natural exponent of 2 where the sum of the digits is 5.By examining the cases n=0,1,2,3,4,5, we can see that for 2^{5}=32, the sum of the digits is exactly 5. We claim that if n>5, then the sum of the digits of 2^{n} cannot be 5, meaning the only solution is n=5.Suppose this is not true, and there is a natural number n>5 for which the sum of the digits of 2^{n} is 5. In this case, each digit is at most 4 (since 2^{n} has at least two digits), the number itself is even, and not divisible by 10, so the last digit is either 2 or 4.If the last digit were 4, then the first digit would be 1, and all intermediate digits would be 0. Since n>5, 2^{n} is divisible by 8 - and even by 64 - so the number formed by the last three digits is also a multiple of 8. According to the above, this number could be 4, 14, or 104, of which only 104 is divisible by 8. Thus, 104 could be the 2-power in question, but 104 is not a power of 2.If the last digit is 2, then - since 2^{n} is divisible by 4 - the number formed by the last two digits is also divisible by 4. Therefore, the second-to-last digit is 3 or 1. In the former case, the already known 32 results. If the second-to-last digit is 1, then it is preceded by an odd digit, because the number formed by the last three digits can only be divisible by 8 in this way. The sum of the digits is 5, so the last three digits are 112.Proceeding similarly, from the fact that the number formed by the last four digits is divisible by 16, and the number formed by the last five digits is divisible by 32, we get that the fourth and fifth digits from the end must necessarily be 0 and 1, respectively. The sum of the digits so far is 5, but the resulting 10112 is not a power of 2.We have thus shown that only for n=5 will the sum of the digits of 1 / 5^{n} in decimal form be 5."},{"problem":"How to connect 50 cities with the smallest number of air routes so that you can travel from any city to any other, making no more than two transfers?#","solution":"Let's highlight one city and connect it by air routes to each of the other 49 cities.

In one step, we can reduce any number of selected piles, provided that we remove the same number of pebbles from each.In the least number of steps, how can we remove all the pebbles from the table?","solution":"First, we prove that this can be done in seven steps; for example, in the following way.1. Step: From the piles containing more than 63 pebbles, we remove 64. Thus, in these, at most 36 remain, and in the others, at most 63, so there is no pile with more than 63 pebbles.2. Step: Where possible, we remove 32 pebbles. By a similar line of thought as before, then in each pile, there can be at most 31 pebbles.3. Step: We take 16 pebbles from the appropriate piles. Then, at most 15 can remain everywhere.From here, the method is already visible: in the 4th step, by taking 8, at most 7 can remain everywhere; in the 5th step, by taking 4, at most 3 can remain; then by taking 2, at most 1 can remain everywhere; and in the 7th step, by taking this one, we are done.Now we see that this could not have been done in six steps. Suppose it could: in the six steps, taking a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{6} pebbles from certain piles, everything was emptied by the end.Assign to each pile a code number of at most six digits in binary as follows. The i-th digit of the number (i=1,2, ldots, 6) should be 1 if we took pebbles from the pile in the i-th step (then only a_{i} could have been taken); and 0 if not. Thus, we have assigned a unique number to each pile. At the same time, such a number can only belong to one pile, since the following decoding procedure is valid. The number overline{x_{6} x_{5} x_{4} x_{3} x_{2} x_{1_{2}}} means that in the first step, we took x_{1} cdot a_{1} pebbles (where x_{1} can be 0 or 1), in the second step x_{2} cdot a_{2}, so in the six steps, we took a total of x_{1} a_{1}+x_{2} a_{2}+ldots+x_{6} a_{6}. The final result, however, is 0, so there were originally x_{1} a_{1}+ldots+x_{6} a_{6} pebbles in the pile; from the code, we can thus tell which pile it belongs to.Since we started with 100 piles of different sizes, we would have needed 100 different codes.

A librarian considers the first and second book from left and exchanges them iff they are not alphabetically sorted. Then he is doing the same operation with the second and third book from left etc. Using this procedure he iterates through the bookcase three times from left to right. Considering all possible initial book configurations how many of them will then be alphabetically sorted?","solution":"To solve this problem, we need to understand the sorting process described and then determine how many initial configurations of books will be sorted after three passes.1. Understanding the Sorting Process:   - The librarian iterates through the bookcase from left to right, comparing each pair of adjacent books and swapping them if they are not in alphabetical order.   - This process is repeated three times.2. Key Insight:   - A list of length ( n ) is sortable in ( k ) passes if:     1. The position of the least element is at most ( k+1 ).     2. The list obtained by removing the least element is sortable in ( k-1 ) passes.3. Formulating the Problem:   - Let ( f(n, k) ) be the number of lists sortable in ( k ) passes.   - For ( n < k ), the list is always sortable in ( k ) passes, so ( f(n, k) = n! ).   - For ( n geq k ), the number of sortable lists is given by:     [     f(n, k) = k! cdot (k+1)^{n-k}     ]   - This formula accounts for the fact that once we reach ( k+1 ), we keep multiplying by ( k+1 ) instead of incrementing the multiplier.4. Applying the Formula:   - In our problem, ( k = 3 ) and ( n geq 3 ).   - Therefore, the number of sortable configurations is:     [     f(n, 3) = 3! cdot 4^{n-3}     ]   - Simplifying, we get:     [     f(n, 3) = 6 cdot 4^{n-3}     ]5. Conclusion:   - The number of initial configurations of books that will be sorted after three passes is ( 6 cdot 4^{n-3} ).The final answer is ( boxed{ 6 cdot 4^{n-3} } )."},{"problem":"## Task B-2.1.Solve the equation sqrt{3-frac{1}{2020 x}}=1-frac{1}{2020 x}.","solution":"## Solution.Let's introduce the substitution t=frac{1}{2020 x}, x neq 0.Then the equation becomes sqrt{3-t}=1-t, with the conditions 3-t geqslant 0, 1-t geqslant 0, i.e., t leqslant 1.After squaring, we get 3-t=1-2 t+t^{2}, or t^{2}-t-2=0.Now, t=-1 or t=2.Due to the above condition, the only possible solution is t=-1.This gives frac{1}{2020 x}=-1, so x=-frac{1}{2020}.Let's verify the solution by substituting it back into the given equation.

In the vertices of a regular 100-gon, 100 chips numbered 1, 2, ldots, 100 were placed, in exactly that order clockwise. In one move, it is allowed to swap two adjacent chips if their numbers differ by no more than k. For what smallest k can a series of such moves result in a configuration where each chip is shifted one position clockwise relative to its initial position?(S. Berlov)","solution":"# Answer: 50.Solution. Example. The chip 50 is sequentially exchanged 99 times with the next one counterclockwise. We get the required arrangement.There are several ways to prove the estimate, below we provide two of them.The first way. Suppose that for some k<50 the required arrangement is obtained.At any moment, we consider the arc from chip 100 to chip 1 clockwise to be painted. Since chips 100 and 1 cannot be swapped in one move, each specific chip m (2 leqslant m leqslant 99) could only enter the painted arc or leave the painted arc by swapping with one of the chips 1 or 100.Since initially and at the end, chip m was not on the painted arc, it made an equal number of entries onto the painted arc and exits from the painted arc. For m leqslant 50, chip m could not swap with chip 100, so it could only enter or exit by swapping with chip 1. Upon entry, chip 1 moves 1 position clockwise, and upon exit, 1 position counterclockwise. We conduct similar reasoning for chips m geqslant 51, which cannot swap with chip 1.Thus, we obtain that chips 1 and 100 will make an equal number of moves clockwise and counterclockwise, so they will remain in their positions. Contradiction.The second way. We will count the shifts of the chips relative to their initial position, with a shift clockwise being counted as positive and a shift counterclockwise as negative. Then, when two chips are swapped, +1 is added to the shift of one of them, and -1 to the other. Therefore, the sum of the shifts after the operations will be 0.We reason by contradiction: suppose that for k<50 each chip i is finally shifted one position clockwise, i.e., its shift is 1+100 t_{i} (here t_{i} is the integer \\"number of rotations\\" clockwise, in particular, if t_{i}<0, chip i made left|t_{i}right| rotations counterclockwise). Then the total shift of all 100 chips is 100left(t_{1}+t_{2}+ldots+t_{100}right)+100. Since it must equal 0, we have t_{1}+t_{2}+ldots+t_{100}=-1.Since k<50, chips with numbers i and j, where j geqslant i+50, could not swap places, so their shifts at any moment are definitely less than 100 apart, meaning the \\"number of rotations\\" t_{i} and t_{j} are equal for j geqslant i+50. Hence, we have t_{1}=t_{51}, t_{2}=t_{52}, ldots, t_{50}=t_{100}. Then the sum t_{1}+t_{2}+ldots+t_{100}=2left(t_{1}+right. left.+t_{2}+ldots+t_{50}right) is even, and thus cannot equal -1. Contradiction.Remark 1. The last reasoning can be modified as follows.From this, t_{1}=t_{51}, t_{1}=t_{52}, ldots, t_{1}=t_{100}, t_{2}=t_{100}, t_{3}=t_{100}, ldots, t_{50}=t_{100}, thus all t_{i} are equal to t_{1}. Then t_{1}+t_{2}+ +ldots+t_{100}=100 t_{1} neq-1.Remark 2. The proof can be completed by contradiction in another way, replacing the last paragraph of the solution with the following reasoning.We will paint chips red for which t_{i} geqslant 0, and blue for which t_{i}<0. Clearly, at some point, a blue and a red chip must swap, since the difference in their shifts is at least 100. Since k<50, the pair of chips 1 and 51 are of the same color, similarly pairs of chips 1 and 52, ldots, 1 and 100, 2 and 100, 3 and 100, ldots, 50 and 100- are of the same color. Thus, all chips are of the same color. We know that t_{1}+t_{2}+ldots+t_{100}=-1, so among the numbers t_{1}, ldots, t_{100} there are both non-negative and negative ones, i.e., there are both red and blue chips - contradiction.Comment.

For example, it is possible to use the sum of the internal angles of a general polygon: an n-sided polygon can be divided (in various ways) into n-2 triangles, so the sum of its internal angles is (n-2) cdot 180^{circ}.Another solution. The sum of the internal angles of the pentagon K L M N O is equal to 3 cdot 180^{circ}=540^{circ}. Similarly to the solution mentioned above, the internal angles at vertices K, L, M, N, O can be expressed, respectively, as180^{circ}-beta-delta, quad 180^{circ}-gamma-varepsilon, quad 180^{circ}-delta-alpha, quad 180^{circ}-varepsilon-beta, quad 180^{circ}-alpha-gamma .In total, we getbegin{aligned}5 cdot 180^{circ}-2(alpha+beta+gamma+delta+varepsilon) & =540^{circ}, 2(alpha+beta+gamma+delta+varepsilon) & =360^{circ}, alpha+beta+gamma+delta+varepsilon & =180^{circ} .end{aligned}[^0]:    * Disjoint sets are sets with an empty intersection, i.e., sets without a common element."},{"problem":"Given a function f(x) = A sin(omega x + varphi), where x in mathbb{R}, A > 0, omega > 0, and 0 < varphi < frac{pi}{2}, the period of the function is pi, and there is a lowest point on its graph at Mleft(frac{2pi}{3}, -2right).  (Ⅰ) Find the analytic expression of f(x).  (Ⅱ) Determine the intervals on which f(x) is monotonic.  (Ⅲ) Find the range of f(x) when x in left[0, frac{pi}{12}right].","solution":"(Ⅰ) Since the minimal positive period of the function is pi and the minimum value is -2,  we have A = 2 and T = frac{2pi}{omega} = pi, which means omega = 2.  Thus, the function f(x) can be written as f(x) = 2sin(2x + varphi).  Given that the lowest point on the graph is Mleft(frac{2pi}{3}, -2right), we have  2sinleft(2 times frac{2pi}{3} + varphiright) = -2,  which implies sinleft(frac{4pi}{3} + varphiright) = -1.  Therefore, frac{4pi}{3} + varphi = frac{3pi}{2} + 2kpi, where k in mathbb{Z}.  This leads to varphi = frac{pi}{6} + 2kpi, with k in mathbb{Z}.  Since 0 < varphi < frac{pi}{2}, when k = 0, we have varphi = frac{pi}{6}.  Therefore, the analytic expression of f(x) is f(x) = 2sinleft(2x + frac{pi}{6}right).  (Ⅱ) To find the monotonic intervals, we consider2kpi + frac{pi}{2} leq 2x + frac{pi}{6} leq 2kpi + frac{3pi}{2}, quad k in mathbb{Z},  which simplifies to  kpi + frac{pi}{6} leq x leq kpi + frac{2pi}{3}, quad k in mathbb{Z}.  So the function is decreasing on the interval left[kpi + frac{pi}{6}, kpi + frac{2pi}{3}right] for k in mathbb{Z}.  Similarly, for the increasing intervals, we have  2kpi - frac{pi}{2} leq 2x + frac{pi}{6} leq 2kpi + frac{pi}{2}, quad k in mathbb{Z},  which simplifies to  kpi - frac{pi}{3} leq x leq kpi + frac{pi}{6}, quad k in mathbb{Z}.  So the function is increasing on the interval left[kpi - frac{pi}{3}, kpi + frac{pi}{6}right] for k in mathbb{Z}.

Thus sinleft(2x + frac{pi}{6}right) = sin frac{pi}{6} = frac{1}{2},  and sinleft(2x + frac{pi}{6}right) = sin frac{pi}{3} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}.

Introduce the cumulative sum sequence:   Define ( t_n = x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_n ). Then, the recurrence relation can be rewritten in terms of ( t_n ):   [   alpha x_n = t_{n+1}   ]   Since ( t_{n+1} = t_n + x_{n+1} ), we can express ( x_{n+1} ) as:   [   x_{n+1} = t_{n+1} - t_n   ]3.

Verify the smallest (alpha):   For (alpha = 4), the characteristic equation becomes:   [   r^2 - 4r + 4 = 0 implies (r - 2)^2 = 0   ]   Thus, ( r = 2 ) is a repeated root.

Also,[g(x^{12}) - 6 = x^{60} + x^{48} + x^{36} + x^{24} + x^{12} - 5  = (x^{60} - 1) + (x^{48} - 1) + (x^{36} - 1) + (x^{24} - 1) + (x^{12} - 1).]Each term is a multiple of x^6 - 1. For example,[x^{60} - 1 = (x^6 - 1)(x^{54} + x^{48} + dots + x^6 + 1).]Hence, g(x^{12}) - 6 is a multiple of x^6 - 1, which means that g(x^{12}) - 6 is a multiple of g(x). Therefore, the remainder is boxed{6}. The answer is (A).Solution 2We express the quotient and remainder as follows.[g(x^{12}) = Q(x) g(x) + R(x)]Note that the solutions to g(x) correspond to the 6th roots of unity, excluding 1. Hence, we have x^6 = 1, allowing us to set:[g(x^{12}) = 6][g(x) = 0]We have 5 values of x that return R(x) = 6. However, g(x) is quintic, implying the remainder is of degree at most 4. Since there are 5 solutions, the only possibility is that the remainder is a constant boxed{6}.Solution 3We can use the Chinese remainder theorem over mathbb{Q}[x]. Since g(x)=(x+1)(x^2-x+1)(x^2+x+1), mathbb{Q}[x]/gcong mathbb{Q}[x]/(x+1)times mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2-x+1)times mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2+x+1). This means that if we can find the remainder of g(x^{12}) modulo x+1,x^2-x+1,x^2+x+1, we can reconstruct the remainder modulo g. We can further use that each factor is irreducible and that if p(x) is an irreducible polynomial over mathbb{Q} with root alpha, mathbb{Q}[x]/pcong mathbb{Q}(alpha) so to evaluate the remainders of g(x^{12}), we just need to evaluate it on one of the roots of the irreducible factors. The first factor has root -1, the second has roots the primitive sixth roots of unity, and the third as roots the primitive cube roots of unity (this is easily seen as g(x)(x-1)=x^6-1). Evaluating g(x^{12}) on each of these values yields g(1)=6 so the remainder is 6 on each factor on the right of the isomorphism. Hence, by the Chinese remainder theorem, the remainder modulo g must be boxed{6} as well.","solution":"empty"},{"problem":"Task 1.

Combining these, we get:   [   (x^2 + 1)(y^2 + 1) + 4(x - 1)(y - 1) = x^2 y^2 + x^2 + y^2 + 1 + 4xy - 4x - 4y + 4   ]5.

Notice that:   [   (x^2 + 1)(y^2 + 1) = (x + yi)(x - yi)(y + i)(y - i)   ]7. This can be simplified using complex numbers:   [   (x + yi)(x - yi)(y + i)(y - i) = {(xy - 1) + (x + y)i}{(xy - 1) - (x + y)i}   ]8. This results in:   [   (xy - 1)^2 + (x + y)^2   ]9. Therefore, we have:   [   (x^2 + 1)(y^2 + 1) = (xy - 1)^2 + (x + y)^2   ]10. Substituting back into the original inequality:    [    (xy - 1)^2 + (x + y)^2 + 4(x - 1)(y - 1) geq 0    ]11.

Simplifying further:    [    (xy - 1)^2 + (x + y)^2 + 4xy - 4x - 4y + 4 = (x + y - 2)^2 + (xy + 1)^2    ]14. Since both ((x + y - 2)^2) and ((xy + 1)^2) are squares, they are always non-negative:    [    (x + y - 2)^2 + (xy + 1)^2 geq 0    ]15.

In the last two cases, however, f=h=6 or e=g=6 would result, which is not admissible.

The key to solving this question is that if a function has an extreme value at a point, then the derivative of the function at that point equals 0. Pay attention to the application of this condition.AnswerSince the function f(x)=x(x-c)^{2},  then f′(x)=3x^{2}-4cx+c^{2},  and f(x)=x(x-c)^{2} has an extreme value at x=2,  thus f′(2)=12-8c+c^{2}=0,  solving this gives c=2 or 6,  and since the function has a minimum value at x=2, thus c=2,  when c=6, the function f(x)=x(x-c)^{2} has a maximum value at x=2,  therefore, the correct choice is boxed{C}."},{"problem":"If x^{2}+6x+k is a perfect square trinomial, then k=____.","solution":"To determine the value of k for which x^{2}+6x+k is a perfect square trinomial, we recall that a perfect square trinomial can be expressed in the form (x+a)^{2} = x^{2} + 2ax + a^{2}.

Moving the decimal point of the smaller number one place to the right makes it equal to the larger number, which means the larger number is 10 times the smaller number. The difference between the two numbers is 7.02, which is also 9 times the smaller number (since 10 - 1 = 9). We can find the smaller number using division, and then find the larger number by multiplying the smaller number by 10.  This problem mainly examines the rule of changes in the magnitude of numbers caused by the movement of decimal points, focusing on the relationship between the number obtained by moving one place to the right (the larger number) and the smaller number.Thus, the larger number is boxed{7.8}, and the smaller number is boxed{0.78}."},{"problem":"1.
