However, this is just temporally and gets regularized after a couple of cycles.Occasional in take of Ipill has no effect on fertility. However, persistent in take for years could suppress ovulation that  would take a long time say up to six months and even above one year before coming back. With absence of ovulation, you will definitely be unable to get a pregnancy.Unprotected intercourse is a risk factor for sexually transmissible infections such as HIV, herpes, , hepatitis B virus and HPV which is associated with cervical cancer.Hope this helps you.Best regardsDr Achuo"},{"Patient":"Hi, I need some advice regarding the morning after pill.

Thanks","Doctor":"Hi there ~I understand your concern.  After having taken the morning after pill, it usually is the case that if you are in the period of ovulation, your chances of becoming pregnant go down to as low as nothing.

I have gained weight on my abdominal area  due depo provera  injections , Its been 6 months since I've discontinued and also tried had through all means such walking dieting yoga etc but it is not reducing also since I was on it I would not get my periods ,Till date I have't got them . I had My  last depo provera shot in september last year 2012","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.The return of menstruation after a progesterone injection like Depo Provera is usually delayed. The cycles take many months to normalize and sometimes there may be complete suppression of periods.The increase of weight in the abdominal area is due to bulky uterus.  Normally during period, the  endometrial cells of uterus proliferate (multiply) resulting in thickening of endometrium (inner lining of uterus) due to the action of estrogen. When menstruation starts this endometrium is shed out as clots and the uterus reverts back to the normal size.Since you have not got the periods, the thickened endometrium has resulted in bulky uterus. Also the hormonal imbalance due to absent period has added to your problem of weight gain. An ultrasound of uterus will reveal the size of uterus and the the endometrial thickening. Since endometrial proliferation can be either simple or can result in problems like cancer, you should visit a gynecologist for a proper evaluation and to rule out problems like cancer.I hope this is useful."},{"Patient":"Hi I have been taking Yaz however I have not changed to lavlin .

Since you are already on Yaz and the sugar pills get over on tuesday, you should start the active pills of Levlin from wednesday.The small beige coloured pills in Levlin pack are the hormonal pills and the large white coloured pills are the non hormonal pills. You should start with the small hormonal pill on wednesday. Once the 21 hormonal pills get over, the non hormonal white pills can be taken and during this time you will get your menstrual cycle. Levlin is a low dose hormonal pill. In case you have doubt about the identification of  the hormonal pills in the pack,  you should seek the help of your treating Dr, otherwise, if you start with the wrong pill, there may be a contraceptive failure.I hope this is useful."},{"Patient":"My husband is 61 and has symptoms of puffy eyes, sleeps for long periods of time and pee is dark.

I have consulted Gynaecologist and taken blood and Hormone test. Reports were fine , but due to discharged doctor advised to remove copper T.And it has been removed but after 14days of my periods i am experiencing black discharge for 5 days again. why this is happening , now i don\`t have Copper T in my body.?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.Irregular periods and brown discharge are some of the drawbacks of copper T and occur during the first 3 to 6 months of copper T insertion.  Although copper T is only a non hormonal IUCD, the periods take some time to get regularized after its removal. Your bleeding could be due to inter menstrual bleeding. But brown discharge can also be due to vaginal infection or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).  If the brown discharge/bleeding continues or if it is accompanied by pain and fever, then it indicates PID and you should consult your treating Dr. for further evaluation.Also, you have not mentioned if you are using any other contraceptive method. If you are using none, and if you are sexually active, then the brown discharge could be due to implantation bleeding. Usually the implantation bleeding occurs to a maximum period of only for 2 to 3 days but rarely can extend more than that. You can rule out pregnancy through home kits.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"I had a Mirena IUD inserted a month ago. I have bled everday since insertion, from light spotting to heavy bleeding. The more physically active I am the more heavily I bleed and the more pain I have pain every I can only associate with the IUD because it was not present until the IUD was inserted. I have pain while active and while at rest. Should I have it removed or is there potentially something wrong with it?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.Mirena contains Levonorgestrel, a progesterone that is released slowly, daily for a period of five years. One of the main problems of IUCD like Mirena is inter menstrual bleeding in the initial 3 to 6 months. Progesterone results in spotting, vaginal discharge, abdominal pain. mood changes and bloating sensation. But these symptoms wane off after few months as the body gets adopted to the effects of progesterone and the hormonal imbalance due to Mirena.IUCDs can result in vaginal infection or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) which will also present with similar symptoms of pain, discharge and spotting. If the spotting and abdominal pain persists or if it worsens, then you should consult your treating Dr. to rule out  PID.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"I received a birth control shot about a month ago because I am sexually active and don't want to become pregnant. The doctor had told me that there would hardly be any blood with periods and the cramps would almost be nonexistent. All of yesterday I had horrible cramps, the blood was a bit darker than usual, and there was what looked like a piece of skin with the blood. This has never happened to me before, and I was wondering what it could be.","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.The main mechanism by which an hormonal injection acts is through suppression of ovulation. An ovulatory cycles are painless and that's why your Dr has said so. Generally it takes some time for the hormones to act as they are administered externally and the body takes some time to get adjusted to this hormonal imbalance. So, they may not be  effective in preventing the ovulation in the very first month. If the ovulation has occurred already, then hormone injection will not prevent the fertilization but will certainly prevent the implantation. The tissue you saw could have been the expelled fertilized ovum. Also heavy bleeding and delayed periods are common in the initial few months. If your period had been a little delayed following the hormone shot, then the tissue could be  endometrium which is thickened when there is delayed period. If  the  bleeding persists and if you pass a lot of clots, then you should seek your treating Dr's opinion. Otherwise, the heavy bleeding may be because of  the hormonal imbalance due to the injection. I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"I started low dose birth control on Friday May 4th.  It was the first day I had blood spotting for my expected menstrual cycle.  I have taken the pill every day since at almost the exact same time. And I have not had sex or any physical contact with any men at all during this time.My period was unusually light for an entire week.  I thought maybe this was a result of the pill.  But now it is 15 days later and my period is still going.  Today was the heaviest day yet.  Can this be because of the pill?  I should probably mention that I am overweight (5ft 3.5 inches 209 lb).  I have an appointment with my doctor on 5/30 but now I'm getting concerned.","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.Light or heavy flow, delayed or frequent period, irregular period, spotting and bleeding between period are all the different types of effects of OCP seen in various people in the initial few months. It will take 3 to 6 months for the period to get regularized after starting the pills as you are taking a low dose birth control pill.Although you are not sexually active, you should continue the pills irrespective of the bleeding after the permitted gap for menstrual period. The bleeding will be controlled when the hormonal level increases if the pills are taken regularly.Obesity with light period may indicate PCOD. The OCPs can result in weight gain in the long run and so you should reduce your weight. Since the bleeding has increased and is persistent, it is wise to consult the Dr. A combination of drugs like Mafenamic acid and Tranexamic acid  will help to control the bleeding. Your treating Dr will know about these drugs.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"i am recently married, i have open sexbefore one day of my wife period, so i ahve given i pill to avoid pregnency, it creates extra bleeding till 5 days, after completion of period we have again open sex, again i have given ipill, after taking i pill now it abt 3 days, agaiin bleeding start, i am worried why this bleeding happens.plz suggest","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.i pill is not a substitute for regular contraceptive and should be used only as an emergency measure for accidental/ unplanned exposure. It contains high dose of progesterone and results in withdrawal bleeding within a week of taking the pill and that is the reason for the bleeding  every time after taking the pill. Your wife should not use it so frequently as it can result in many serious complications like breast cancer if used too frequently. If you don't want her to conceive then you should opt for regular contraceptive method like oral contraceptive pills.A duration of one week from the first day of period is relatively safe period. Similarly one week before the expected date of period is safe. The ovulation occurs only 14 days before the onset of period and a period of one week on either side of it are safe. But this is a very crude method of calculating the safe period and may result in unwanted pregnancy if not calculated properly. Also during the initial months of marriage, the periods may be irregular due to both emotional and physiological factors. Hence it is wise to start a regular contraceptive method to prevent pregnancy after consulting your treating Dr.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"Hi there doctor I am very confused at the moment :( about 15 days ago I had un protected sex.

I did take home pregency test a d it was negative. By lately I have a been very nausea I have had awful bad discomfort in my belly and I am very very nausea and very tired. Also I have been getting dizzy spells. I am very worried. I can't lie on my stomach as it hurts so so much. Please help","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.Your symptoms of nausea, abdominal cramps and tiredness may be due to the high level of progesterone in the pill rather than pregnancy because severe abdominal pain in early stage of pregnancy is uncommon. Emergency pill or morning after pill is effective  if it is taken within 72 hours after an unprotected sex. If the ovulation has already occurred then the morning after pill will not interfere with fertilization but will interfere with implantation of the fertilized ovum. Since you have got withdrawal bleeding, the chances of pregnancy is minimal. Although the failure rate is less than 10% you should still rule out pregnancy through blood test which is more accurate than the urine test. If found positive then you should consult your treating Dr. about  further course of action. In future, if you don't want to conceive but want to be sexually active, then you should opt for a proper method of contraception like OCP.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"Hi i been on nuva ring for 3 weeks noe and i took it off just today because ive had not spotting but blending alot and when i took it off it was dark almos black blood and it had a strong smell .. And then i passes  two big flesh .. To be exact it lookt like chichen breast when u thinly cut it and really rubbery im sure it was skinn and it happend again 5min ago what is it..","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.Nuva ring contains both estrogen and progesterone like the OCP. If you have used it for first time, then it would not have prevented the ovulation and the subsequent fertilization but it would have prevented the implantation of the fertilized ovum. If such is the case, then the rubbery tissue you are passing indicates abortion and the tissues are un implanted fertilized ovum. Black blood is also suggestive of the same. If the bleeding increases with lots of such tissue coming out, then it is in favor of miscarriage.The bleeding should stop in a few days once all the tissue is passed out. Ultra sound of uterus will reveal if the uterine cavity is empty and if it is a complete abortion. You should consult a gynecologist if the bleeding continues which indicates incomplete abortion, in that case you will need a D&C.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"I am currently on TriSprintec, a triphasic oral contraceptive.

Also... after I finish my next pack (on week 1 pills) do I wait a week and start a new pack or start a new pack right away?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.The triphasic pills are supposed to mimic the normal menstruation. Trisprintec contains the same concentration of ethinyl estradiol, the estrogen in all the 21 active pills with steadily increasing dose of progesterone, norgestimate. This resembles what happens in a normal menstrual cycle. The total pills are 28 of which 21 (grey, light blue and blue) are active hormonal and 7 white pills are non hormonal pills.You could skip the white non hormonal pills and can post pone your period by reversing the strip and starting with 3rd week blue pill and giving a gap of one week for the menstrual cycle.

MY AGE 23, I'VE BEEN MISSING MY PERIODS SO DOC SUGGESTED ME KRIMSON 35.","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.Krimson contains Ethinyl Estradiol, an estrogen and Cyproterone acetate, an anti androgen. It is given for persons with PCOS having high androgen level. It not only regularizes the period but also prevents the conception by inhibiting the ovulation and making the cycles anovulatory. Hence there is no need for another contraceptive method while you are on Krimson and the 'morning after pill' you took is totally unnecessary. Also the hormones in the pill (high dose of progesterone) will interfere with the onset of your next cycle that has been regularized by Krimson. Since you have already taken the pill and the withdrawal bleeding is imminent you can stop Krimson and follow other methods of contraception like condom (to be on the safer side) but not hormone pills  till you get the withdrawal bleeding. You can start the fresh pack of Krimson when you get the period (withdrawal bleeding) following the pill.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"I'm having the coil fitted next week and I'm currently on cerazette.

Both Cerazette and Mirena contain progesterone and so there is no necessity to start a new packet of Cerazette. . In case of Mirena, progesterone will be released slowly over a period of 5 years. The chances of pregnancy is minimal in the first week of menstrual cycle and it is a 'safe period'. Hence there is no need for a new pack of Cerezette. Mirena can result in irregular bleeding in the first few weeks of its insertion.

Since i pill contains high dose of progesterone it may interfere with her menstrual cycle and can result in delayed period. So do not panic. You can exclude pregnancy through blood test which is more accurate than urine test and it can detect pregnancy at much earlier stage.Although abortion kits are available over the counter, it is advisable to take them only under your treating Dr's  supervision to avoid complications like incomplete abortion and rupture of uterus.

I have not started taking the amoxicillin yet because I am worried that it will decrease the effectiveness of the plan b pill. Will taking the antibiotic interfere with what the plan b pill is suppose to be doing?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.The antibiotics like Ampilcillin, Amoxicillin, Tetracyclines, Clarithromycin and Co-trimoxazole  interfere with the function of plan B by suppressing the intestinal microflora and decreasing  the duration of action of Levonorgestrel present in plan B.Since you have already taken Plan B and the above said antibiotics will reduce the efficacy of plan B you can take some other antibiotic like Cephalosporins or Azithromycin. Although Azithromycin belongs to the same group of Clarithromycin it does not have any interaction with Levonorgestrel (progesterone) and only interferes with estrogen activity. Since plan B does not contain estrogen, it is safer to take Azithromycin. Also Azithromycin is very effective in throat infection. Your treating Dr will know about these drugs.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"Hi Doc! i got married last year nd had oral contraceptives for 2 months ,then discontinued it coz my husband went to abroad.Now im  united with my husband again after ten months nd taking contraceptives again.The problem is dat im noticing less bleeding nd almost no pain during periods.Before my weddind i used to have lots of pain nd bleeding, nd after my separation(with husband) also  lots of bleeding nd pain was there.I guess its related with sexual activity nd contraception... dont kno what exactly????Now im worried is it normal or having any significance ... coz we both r thinking to plan a baby now...","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.You have a very good observation indeed. Generally,  menstrual cycles are painful as they are  ovulatory cycles. Ovulation is the rupture of ovum and release of egg, necessary for fertilization. The oral contraceptives inhibit ovulation and makes the cycles anovulatory.  This is one of the main action of OCP in preventing conception. The pain and bleeding during menstruation are due to increased uterine contraction needed to expel the unfertilized egg products in the form of clots. You have no pain and less bleeding with OCP not only because the cycles are anovulatory but also because the bleeding is withdrawal bleeding. Also, with OCP, your periods will be on a regular cyclical pattern.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"About 3 weeks ago, I had a drunken sexual encounter. He did not ejaculate inside of me, intercourse barely occurred, but there was contact and I know that there is always a chance of a few sperm lurking around in pre-cum.

So, The next morning, about 8 hours later I took the morning after pill as a precaution. 6 days later, I got the bleeding that I assume is the induced bleeding from the pill because my period was not due for 2 weeks. It was bright red and a moderately heavy flow that lasted for 6 days. Now, on the week that I was supposed to start my normal period, I have bleeding that looks like my normal period and the flow is beginning like a normal period. Is this normal? I know that it says your period can come early or late, but I am still confused as to if I am supposed to get the withdrawal bleeding and then my normal period at the normal time.","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.You have taken the right precaution. Your knowledge about the actions of the pill is also perfect. As you are aware of, the pill contains high amount of progesterone that has resulted in withdrawal bleeding. Also such a high dose of progesterone can interfere with your regular menstrual cycles and the cycles can be either delayed or earlier. This happens if the pills are taken too frequently which is not advisable. The bleeding could be  inter menstrual bleeding, another side effect of the pill. Either it may take a while for your period to get regularized or if your hormonal balance is back to normal, your next period can be regular. So, if you want to have an active sexual life without getting pregnant, then you should opt for a permanent contraceptive method like OCP.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"i started the pill my last period which was at the end of april took it until next period, has bleeding inbetween that lasted for a few days, then got what i think is my next period a few days earlier then it should be..., really confused, i have been having symptoms like nausea, cramping, irritability....what could this mean? is this from the pill or something else","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.All  OCPs contain hormones and  will result in hormonal imbalance by interfering with the existing hormonal status of the body. So depending upon the individuals, it will take some time, usually 3 to 6 months, for establishment of  the regular cyclical pattern of menstruation.One of the main side effects of the pills is irregular bleeding and bleeding between periods. Your nausea, cramping and irritability are due to the action of progesterone in the pill. You should complete all the pills in the pack and should not stop if the bleeding starts. Mistaking the bleeding/spotting before the completion of the pack and stopping the pills will interfere with the next cycle and will also abolish the contraceptive effect of the pills. OCPs are available in different combinations with various strengths. If you still have these side effects after few cycles, then you can consult with your treating Dr. for a different type of pill. Usually progesterone alone pill or mini pill causes these problems but you have not mentioned the type of pill you are taking.

I also get really paranoid and look too much into what people are saying to me. Also have been bleeding the whole time. Is this due to the pill and should I switch /come off it? Thanks!","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.Do not worry. The problems you are having are due to the influence of hormones present in Levest. The progesterone, Levonorgestrel in Levest is responsible for headache, mood swings, nausea, dizziness, depression and fatigue. Levest also results in bleeding/ spotting between periods. It may take a minimum period of three months for your body to get adjusted to the effects of such hormonal pills. If these side effects continue and interfere with your daily activities then you can switch for another OCP combination with lesser amount of progesterone. Triphasic pills contain same amount of estrogen in all 21 tablets but varying strength of progesterone for every 7 pills in the pack.  Progesterone is started at a minimum dose and increased every 7 days. Triphasic pills are claimed to mimic the hormonal pattern that occurs during a normal menstrual cycle. Since progesterone is causing the side effects you can consult your treating Dr and opt for a triphasic pill and that may solve your problems.I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"Hi, I'm 21 and I've never ever taken contreceptives before in my life and I'd like to start with the Pill.

Generally OCPs are started on the first day of menstrual cycle with non hormonal pills (red pills). But, since you have completed your periods, you should start with the brown pills (6 in number) and take it continuously, one on each day for 6 days, followed by 5 white tablets, then 10 yellow tablets and finally 7 red inactive tablets.You should take the tablets exactly on the same time every day. Never miss the tablet. If you happen to miss one tablet, take 2 on the next day at the usual time. If you miss more than 2 tablets, then you should discontinue the strip and use another contraceptive method till you get your period and restart with red inactive pills on the first day of period.You should not stop the pill if you get bleeding/ spotting while taking the pills.

But I looked at the information leaflet for the Rigevidon, and it says when starting a new pill you must carry on the pill and not have a 7 day break, but i am already on the break. Will this effect me? And could i be at risk of being pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.Both Microgynon and Rigevidon contain 21 active tablets of 30 micro gms of Ethinyl Estradiol and 150 micro grams of Levonorgestrel respectively. A 7 day free period is allowed for the menstrual cycle. All the OCPs when you start them for the first time, if you are not under the protection of any other  OCP on the previous cycle,  should be started on the first day of the menstrual cycle but not otherwise. since you are already on Microgynon and this 7 day gap is the routine gap left for menstration, you need not worry. As you do every month you can start Rigevidon on the usual 8th day after the last pill of Microgynon.I hope this is useful."},{"Patient":"I've been taking the birth control Reclipsen for about 8 months. I had unprotected sex during the placebo week of the birth control, and got my period the next day. I have decided to not continue taking the birth control as I want to give my body a rest from the hormones, so I will not be continuing the next pack. What is the likelihood that I could become pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.Inter menstrual bleeding or spotting during OCP is common. This occurs in the initial few months and is quite rare after 8 months. The likelihood of your pregnancy is high if you don't continue the tablets. Although the hormonal effect in suppressing the ovulation is expected to continue for 1 or 2 months after stopping the pills, it need not be so in every person and in some the fertility can return in the next period itself. The safe period to avoid pregnancy is only for a week from the day of onset of period, so if you don't continue the pill the chances of pregnancy is more. Otherwise you should opt for another protection method like condom till the onset of the next period.I hope this is useful."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am taking mercilon.

Query: will I get pregnant? Should I take the emergency contraceptive now? It is now may 21. thanks.","Doctor":"Hi,The emergency contraceptive pill should be taken on the same day for it to have an effect, as such there is no point in taking one now.How long have you been on the pill, if its been for a long time then there is a chance that you wont get pregnant.But in these things there is always a chance, especially if you were ovulating.Pills work by suppressing ovulation, if you miss one - you may ovulate. As such you can either wait till your period should start or take a home pregnancy test.I hope this answered your question."},{"Patient":"I got irritated skin and 3 small bumps on the left side of the foreskin area after masturbation it s been doing this for a month now.

Its been three days since we had the unprotected sex and i am still discharging a lot. Is this something to worry about?","Doctor":"Hi,Well missing two doses and having unprotected sex seriously increases the chances of you getting pregnant.What you need to know is that a brown discharge is normally not something to worry about, but a brown discharge around 4-5 days after having unprotected sex can be because you have conceived and are now pregnant.As such take a home pregnancy test to make sure.I hope this answered your question."},{"Patient":"Hi.

PLEASE HELP.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM.Thank you for your query.I would first like to state that if you and your partner practised anal intercourse, there is no chance of pregnancy. This is not possible.But if you think during your sexual contact, there was a chance that your partners penis ejaculated inside your vagina, then the first thing you would have to do is to rule out/confirm pregnancy. This can be done with the help of a urine pregnancy kit, which can be done at home. This will have to be conducted either 20 days after your sexual contact or on the first or second day of a missed period. The most accurate result can be achieved with an early morning urine sample.Repeat this test 2-3 times to confirm a result.I hope I have succeeded in providing the information you were looking for.

I have a long-term boyfriend and I am sexually active. I am on the pill and about 2 and a half months ago I changed the pill I was on to a different one for my skin. For the past three weeks I have been very bloated. It began when I was due on for my period the same as it usually does, but it never went down and I am still very bloated. I feel very unattractive and uncomfortable. I've had some stomach cramps but not really anything out of the usual. I've had some brown discharge, but I do get that sometimes, so again I'm not thinking anything of it. I did have my period, so I don't think I'm pregnant, although I do know you can still have a period when pregnant. In my house, we are having a kitchen extension so we haven't had a kitchen for a while and therefore I am eating a lot of takeaway food, but it doesn't seem drastically more than usual? Could this very slight change make such a bloating in my stomach? I'm just very scared and confused right now and I really don't know what to do!","Doctor":"Hi there ~I understand your concerns.  It is unusual to have a period when you are pregnant.  I wonder if you are having a miscarriage and should consult a gynecologist.  If the bleeding is from elsewhere and you have retained your pregnancy you will know after the pelvic examination by the gynecologist.  Bloating of your stomach could be due to many reasons.  One that I can gather from your history is you having changed the pills and I am not sure what you are referring to.  The other is that you could be having gastritis which is easily treatable.  I hope you see a doctor for this and it usually helps.  Over the counter medications like digene before food may also be helpful.

Gave me papers about Lymph Nodes. I m scared it s cancer. I have an appointment to see a urologist on Monday. I have a 10 month old daughter and found out we re going to have another baby. The growth is not on my testicles, it s just under my penis. It s not perfectly round. I work at a chicken factory and I left and bend all day.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. If the growth is not attached to testis then most probably it would be spermatocele which is the cyst in the testicular tubes and it is a fairly harmless condition but i would still recommend you to get scrotal ultrasound done which would be more helpful to differentiate the swelling. Mostly the only treatment offered for spermatocele is pain management if it occurs.

Birth control: The initiation of birth control can easily cause side effects like lower abdominal cramps, mood swings, slight discharge (blood), etc. Thus, what you could be experiencing could be side effects of the birth control. You could consult your prescribing doctor and report the same2. Pregnancy: This is always done. Is routine in patients experiencing such symptoms, this I request you to conduct a home pregnancy test, which is to be done at least 20 days after your last sexual contact or on the first or second day of a missed period. An early morning urine sample should be used for most accurate results. This test might have to be repeated 2-3 times for an informed result3. Infections: As you are sexually active, the possibility of an infection, will have to be ruled out as wellMy opinion would be to consult your doctor, and find the cause for your presentation, which should most probably be one of the above conditions.I hope I have succeeded in providing the information you were looking for.

I have an active lifestyle which means that I cannot take the pill the same time each each day. Some days it's at 7am, others 8 or 8.30am.

Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello,Yes it is definitely said that birth control pills are most effective when taken at the same time every day.But it differs from pills to pills.If he birth control pill is only progestin type,then a delay of even three hours can cause risk of pregnancy but if the pull is a combinespd type pill ,like GINETTE,which has both estrogen and rogesterone,a delay of few hours won't make the difference.If your delay is less than 12 hours,you take it immediately and if the delay is more than 12 hours you take it and take the other day pill at its daily usual time.If you totally miss it then take two tablets at a time next day,but you have to use a back up with condom protection for atleast one week( applicable in first week of your cycle) and if you miss totally in 2nd,3 rd or 4 th week ,then take two tablets at a time,but then there won't be any need for any back up of condom protection.However if you find it confusing or if you are a forgetful person,then you may opt other methods of contraception likeDEPO- VERA INJ.NUVARING ETC.Discuss with your doctor about these.Thanks"},{"Patient":"Hi I want some advice in relation to contraceptives.

OCP given in  a depot formulation have various hormones like progesterone and that can lead to a depression. It necessary for her to see a doc who can treat her depression with the routine therapies.

But delay in periods always may not indicate pregnancy and that can occur due to many causes. Birth control pills can act as emergency pill when taken in sufficient dosage but they should be taken within 72 hours of the intercourse.

You should not take tablets for termination with out consulting the doctor and confirming the intrauterine pregnancy.

Emergency contraceptive pills act by various mechanisms such as preventing ovulation and  fertilization and by increasing the cervical plug to prevent the entrance of sperms. Haven taken the emergency contraceptive pill one hour prior to intercourse, it is less likely to have had a pregnancy given the above mechanisms and that emergency pills protects against pregnant if taken for up to 72 hours after intercourse. The absence of menses is likely a side effect of the pill which causes hormonal imbalance. However, though its less likely you could be pregnant, you should re do the pregnancy test in a week's time.

It's been in since October that the Mirena was placed, I went in for a check up, and he couldn't feel the strings. I am showing several signs of pregnancy, but I haven't had a period since implantation and my HPTs have been coming up negative for a couple months... could all this just be a side effect of the Mirena? Thank you!","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic. Miena contains Levo norgestrel. It is a progesterone. Probably you are feeling the side effects of progesterone after Mirena implant. It takes few months for the body to get adjusted for the hormonal effects of Mirena. 20 to 25% of women suffer from amenorrhea (absence of period) although this side effect may not be desirable and creates confusion for young women like you. If the strings are not felt by your treating Dr, then it is better to confirm the position of Mirena through X-Ray or ultrasound of pelvis. It will relieve you of your anxiety and will further help you decide about the next method of contraception that you want to follow. The reasons for absence of thread could be 1. bigger size of uterus due to pregnancy. 2. expulsion of Mirena. 3. either it is buried inside the myometrium (muscle layer of uterus) or the stings are withdrawn into uterus. The signs of pregnancy like nausea, bloating sensation and breast heaviness can also occur due to the hormone present in Mirena. Since your pregnancy test is negative, it is better to confirm the presence of Mirena through ultrasound or X-Ray. I hope this is helpful to you."},{"Patient":"Hi, as I heard and read through net copper t seems to be the best option for birth control. My wife is a mother of 4 months baby.

Other IUD is Mirena which unlikely to Copper T contain harmone and is effective for 5 years. Only 1% of failure has been reported with these IUDs.

No, if you take the pills as per the schedule they can prevent the pregnancy irrespective of the period of menstrual cycle. So no need to worry.

I m taking femilone pills from last 3 yrs after 1 baby. i dnt want any other child but i m experienced 4 kg wait loss since last 3 yrs. it was 48 kg now it is 44 kg.Is it due to these tabs. or whenever i will discontinue these tabs will i suffer from any side effects like wt.gain,0r any other?till how many yrs we can continue these tabs safely?","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic. Femilone contains Desogestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol. Generally COMBINED oral contraceptives can result in weight gain. Both estrogen (water retention) and progesterone (androgenic action) are responsible for the weight gain. Desogestrel in Femilone is a progesterone preparation. It is devoid of the androgenic property of most other progesterones. So it does not result in weight gain. But as a progesterone, it results in severe nausea, loss of appetite and bloating sensation in stomach all of which can contribute to your loss of weight. You should stop Femilone at least 6 months before you plan for your pregnancy. Although it may take only 1 to 2 months for the return of ovulation and fertility to  in some persons ovulation may be delayed. Weight gain after stopping the pill is not noted in many people but in your case the improved appetite that may occur on stopping the pill may contribute to weight gain. Loss of 4 kg in a span of 3 years is not a drastic weight loss and may not necessarily be due to pill and could be due to other factors like stress. Being hormonal preparations, both estrogen and progesterone can result in increase in blood sugar level (pre diabetic) that can also contribute to weight loss. However since you are taking the pill for 3 years, it is better you  consult your treating Dr to rule out other causes of weight loss. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Can I get pregnant on my ovulation day? I had intercourse in the afternoon and I ovulated that same morning or the night before.

Your chances of getting pregnant are actually very low. I would suggest you visit your gynecologist or antenatal care attendant for counseling. This might be of help in helping you plan on when to get pregnant when you are actually really very ready. A good mastery of your menstrual cycle might be of great help.

Though he was sure that cum didnt go inside the vagina.still i took unwanted 72. Just within half an hour. Next day i had anal with him and he cum in it. But surely it didnt went inside vagina. Its my period date and still not down. Is there anything to worry. What should i do?Warm Regards","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic. Abstinence or withdrawal pull out is associated with a highest failure rate. Although unwanted 72 contains Levonorgestrel, a progesterone which prevents conception and can cause withdrawal bleeding,  it will not protect you from the subsequent exposure you had. Since the second exposure was too close to your periods date, and happened after you took the pill, unwanted 72 may not have been effective. The withdrawal bleeding should have come within 5 to 7 days. Since the pill contains high level of hormone it may have disrupted the menstrual cycle and may have caused the delay. But still in your case, the chances of pill failure is more and so you have to rule out pregnancy through urine and blood tests. If your pregnancy tests are negative, then visit your treating Dr and follow a regular method of contraception suggested by your Dr and avoid using ECP frequently as it may completely disrupt your menstrual cycle. I hope this is helpful to you."},{"Patient":"3 yrs ago I got the mierna iud put in and my periods have been so unperdictable.

I started spotting yesterday a brown discharge and then this morning a little of red but mostly just comes when using the bathroom. Took a pregnancy test a few days ago and came out negative. My question is whether this all sounds like side effects from mirena and post removal? Could it be a stimach ulcer? A combo of several thing?","Doctor":"Hello, thanks  for the query. IUD removed and that chapter closed now. Now we are talking about your problems that nausea, burning sensation in stomach,anxiety. Blood spotting is normal so don't think about that. This is the nature of an individual that how he or she reacts to things around him. over reaction to surrounding is  a form  of anxiety and that is in your case. When iud was inserted from day first you were not feeling comfortable with it and that was an anxiety. IUD removed and still you didn't come out from that dilemma and that is anxiety. Due to anxiety you are feeling hyper acidity ( gastritis ) like symptoms . So control yourself , if not, than consult a psychiatrist and take tt . You will be right within a short period.

I am 37, height 5ft 5in, weight 10st 3pounds (not normal weight had first baby almost 5mths ago I am in the process of losing weight). I am in no pain just bleeding lots and not passing any clots. Any advice? Is it not suitable for me? Should I have it removed? Also due to have period next week.","Doctor":"Dear helbridle, The intrauterine device is by far the most suitable method for your age. Excessive bleeding is a side effect, but there is medical treatment. First of all you should exclude organic causes, the most important of which is displacement. This could be ruled out by a pelvic ultrasound, preferably transvaginal. If the IUD is in place, you may start medical treatment and there are many options, some of which are the following: - mefenamic acid 500 mg tid for 5 days and resume with the beginning of menses. - ibuprofen 600 mg once daily throughout menses. - tranexamic acid 1 gm qid for 5 days and resume with menses. Another option is to change this type by the progesterone medicated type. I hope these words were usefull and wish you the best of luck.

I only waited 6 days not 7 of continuously taking the pill before having sex with my boyfriend and my period is now 6 days late and I'm quite worried even though I know the chance of me being pregnant is quite unlikely. Should I take a pregnancy test or has my period just been skipped?  I'm almost on medication for miagranes but I've continuously taken that and haven't had any problems. Thank you!","Doctor":"Hi and thanks for the query, as you rightly put it, it is very unlikely that it should be a pregnancy. The chances are low but nor impossible however. Missed periods in young females of reproductive age is not a rare phenomenon. But I suggest you get a pregnancy test done. I do not think that the migraine medication has actually interfered in anything, considering the fact its never really done so i the past. Exclude a pregnancy and regularize more your birth control medication. Thanks and best regards, Luchuo, MD."},{"Patient":"I am switching from Caziant birth control and have been on it for five years.

The doctor that gave it to me from the health department said I should be okay. But, I'm still a lil scared. The first time I took the pill, I had no side effects. that was in january. the next time i took it was march 20th or March 19 or 16. I became extremely sick and almost went to the er four days after taking the pill. The things I had were nausea,diarrhea and constipation at the same time. some very scary swelling of the stomach, bloating, abdominal pain, and then, my ovary began to hurt.

There should be at-least two months gap between the emergency pills. So as you maintained the sufficient gap the symptoms you had may not be due repeat use of the pill.

My GP has prescribed me Loette whilst I decide whether or not i want the coil fitted. Can I start taking loette even though i havent started my period yet or do I have to wait? If I started to take it now how long would it take to be effective? Thanks","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for the query. Loette is a combined oral contraceptive pill containing both estrogen and progesterone. The estrogen content of the tablets can interfere with breast feeding, so if you are breast feeding the baby better to prefer progesterone only pills instead of Loette. If you are not breast feeding, you can first take tablets for withdrawal bleeding. After onset of withdrawal bleeding you can take Loette from the first day of the bleed.

My vagina has been slightly itching for about 2 to 3 days, so I used the candizole vaginal tablet 500mg, am just a bit scared what are its effects on such a small foetus, should I be pregnant.","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for using health care magic. The fertile period of most women with a more or less 28days cycle ranges from day 12 to day 16 (The first day of menses is considered day 1) depending on the regularity of the cycle. It is during this period that any unprotected intercourse is likely to lead to fertilization of the egg and consequently pregnancy. Emergency contraception is particularly effective in preventing fertilization or development of the pregnancy thus its wide use. If taken within the first 12 hours following intercourse, the success rate is very high. However, it has an acceptable success rate for up to 72 hours after the intercourse. As to whether it did work or not, only a laboratory test will tell or if you have your menses, persistence absence of which will warrant investigation for pregnancy. Emergency contraception is made up of progesterone which is a hormone produced as well in pregnancy to maintain pregnancy when the pregnancy has already been implanted and there is no effect of the hormone on a developing pregnancy. The itching you talk of are likely to be yeast infection because they are predisposed by hormonal intake and you took emergency hormonal pill. Candizole is a good anti-yeast drug. Hope this helps you. best regards Dr Achuo"},{"Patient":"I started Loestrin Fe birth control 2 and a half weeks ago.

The bleeding you had could be due to injury during coitus, as it will take around one week to heal.

I masturbate mostly once a week but after that i feel a kind of bladder spasm and fill uncomfortable for some days but it disappears itself I am 36 years old and just want to ask some questions? 1 is masturbation really bad or good or nothing? 2 does it make prostate problem ? 3 can it be related to testicle shrinkage? 4 is it related to prostate cancer or it helps not to get it? Thanks Waiting for your answers.....","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. 1- masturbation has both positives and negative effects positive effect is that it will remove the sperms from the body and make room for newer sperms as the process of sperm formation is ever going in men, it is bad in a sense that excessive masturbation does leads to loss of libido and lesser stimulation by natural intercourse 2-in routine masturbation does not causes prostate problem but keep in mind that during ejaculation the prostate also squeezes to release its fluid which contributes in semen so transient urinary obstruction due to prostatic contraction or pain in elvis may occur 3-no masturbation does not cause shrinkage of testes 4-yes there are studies that proves the relation of excessive masturbation with prostatic cancer as excessive masturbation will cause more testosterone to release and this will have effect on prostate which could cause prostatic cancer the proof of this is that the castrated males who were castrated in there early teens never develop prostatic cancer.

What should i do?","Doctor":"Hello, Although implanon is not approved to be used for more than 3 years but the fact is that it doesn't stop working in three years. So if you are worried about it's contraceptive efficacy,you may use an extra backup contraceptive till you get it replaced. Sometimes imlanon  removal becomes difficult because it goes in deep or gets encased in fibrous tissue or may even migrate. Sometimes,too deep insertion may cause some nerve damage and may result in paraesthesia,but there is nothing to worry. This is just normal and would become allright,once it is removed in another few days. Sometimes a lady may feel the paraesthesias more because of subconscious presence of implanon beyond it's usual duration. There is no harm,if it stays there for few weeks more.

If she was close to the time when she would have ovulated or had already ovulated then it does not work as well. Ovulation generally occurs 10 to 17 days since the onset of the last  period. It varies from woman to woman. In general , the effectiveness is high if taken within 12 hrs which was done. The effective is approximately 75% which means that it reduces the number of women who would have conceived by 75 %. If the periods are delayed you would have to do a pregnancy test to determine if comception took place.

(No diagnosis) It stopped (for the most part) until a few months ago, I havent been falling, but getting extremely dizzy, having hotflashes, all of a sudden becoming very nauseated. If I eat, I feel like im going to be sick and it all seems to be happening as one (within minutes of each other) Im sorry this is so long, but im confused and sick of being told that its in my head.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic. The symptoms you are experiencing are definitely not  imaginative  but due to Mirena. Mirena is an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) containing long acting progesterone. It is  highly effective but results in some unwanted side effects like nausea, vomiting. bloating, dizziness, headache and hot flushes (all of which you are experiencing). Mood swings is another common side effect reported with Mirena. The advantages of Mirena are; 1.  It acts directly (local action) on uterine endometrium (lining of uterus) 2.  It does not suppress ovaries and so does not affect progesterone levels. 3.  The blood loss during menstruation is not heavy. The fainting attacks you had when you were young could be postural hypotension (sudden fall in BP) due to vasovagal attack. Your present symptoms are not  related to that but are due to the progesterone present in Mirena. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello, I have a question.

Menstrual irregularity is a common problem with contraceptive devices.

Since you have taken PLAN B ,within 72 hours,the chances of pregnancy become very less. The efficacy of PLAN B is 89% and so you do have some chance of getting the pregnancy. Wait for your periods and if you miss them,then get the urine tested for pregnancy. You may then act accordingly according to the result. If pregnancy is absent,then repeat the test. If repeat test after a week is again negative,then ou may consult your doctor for the necessary action. If pregnancy is positive,then you may consult your doctor for the choice between medical or surgical abortion.

Since your daughter forgot to take the pill on 16th March and had an unprotected sex on the next day, the chances of pregnancy are there.

It is normal to have altered bleeding and spotting with Postinor, as it is a hormone containing pill Also, having sex just the day after your period has an almost zero possibility of resulting in pregnancy. With protected sex, again chance of pregnancy is low. However, every contraceptive has an intrinsic failure rate. Please wait until 15th of April, and if you do not have a normal period by then, take a home urine pregnancy test. Also ensure that all sexual activity till then is protected sex. take care."},{"Patient":"I started taking Metformin 1000 mg last Sunday evening. I had no noticeable side effects.

It prevents conception by inhibiting ovulation, by making cervical mucus thick & impossible for sperm  penetration.  Improper menstural bleeding pattern is quite common. Spotting or scanty bleeding instead of regular bleeding occurs in the initial few months due to hormonal imbalance. Complete absence of period is also very common & so don't be worried.

Could second browninsh spotting be implantation bleed? Thanks","Doctor":"Hi, Return of ovulation usually occurs within six weeks in the majority after removal of the implant. The spotting you have been observing is most likely due to breakthrough. If conception occurs, implantation bleeding is observed around one week -10 days after conception as the embryo implants itself into the uterine wall. It is a fresh bleeding, not brownish but red or pink in color. It is difficult to say without a proper temperature record to say if ovulation has occurred. Recording of basal body temperature should be done systematically. You can test for pregnancy if you miss your period.

Can I take the levonelle 1500 emergency contraceptive pill with the recent treatment for ectopic?","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for using health care magic. Your situation is a little delicate to give a yes or no answer following available literature on the risks of ectopic pregnancy. A past history of ectopic pregnancy greatly increases your chances of having another ectopic pregnancy. Present literature on risk factors suggest that progesterone only pills could be less effective in preventing pregnancy and the risk of ectopic pregnancy is increase following failure of a progesterone only pill or after morning pill. However, the emergency contraception is very effective in preventing pregnancy if taken within the normal time period of less than 72 hours after intercourse especially if taken within the first 12 hours. So, given your medical and social situation at the moment, i think the scare is more in favour of a prevention by taking the emergency pill and carefully watching out with close follow up by a gyns/obst. Missing your period should immediately prompt consultation for a Pregnancy test and an ultrasound. You might consider discussing this with your gyns/obts. Best regards and hope this helps you.

I am currently taking Trinessa and have been on it for three months thus far (after a break of not taking it for over a year and a half). I’ve grown to prefer taking Trinessa, as I have never had any adverse or annoying side effects. My period always comes on a set day and lasts for a 5 days. This month, however, I think my period started early (within 24 hours of taking the last ACTIVE pill of week 3). Usually, my period begins 3-4 days after I stop taking the active pills (and when I’m on my 3rd or 4th placebo pill). I am extremely conscious about diligently taking my pill at the same time every day, but if I occasionally forget to take it at my set time, I take it within a two hour window. (In previous years when I have taken Trinessa, I have missed pills for more than 12 hours before I remembered to take them, yet have not seen any effects of this nature.) Therefore, I’m really confused as to what is going on, since I’m very good about my habits. So my questions become the following: 1. WHY has this happened? Is this indeed the start of my period? 2. Will my period be longer than usual this month (it is usually 5 days long) because I still have to take seven placebo pills? 3. Should I continue the pack I am on (meaning the 7 placebo pills that are left)? 4. Do I have to be concerned about birth control failure if I decide to be intimate right after my period ends? 5. Is it feasible for me to start the first active pill of a new pack today (on the day I was supposed to take my first placebo)?

The abnormal vaginal discharge usually resuts from the infection in vagina or infection in cervix,uterus and fallopian tubes which is called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). lower abdominal pain is usually associated with PID than with the infection in vagina alone so in your case chances of PID seems more than the infection in the vagina alone as your vaginal discharge is yellow in colour, itchy and associated with lower abdominal pain even if it is not foul smelling .PID has no relationship with the implant removal but may be related to IUCD, number of sexual partners, general hygiene mantainance, douching techanique and other factors.

(taking alesse )","Doctor":"Hello, I would be happy to help you with your question. This is not typical for a birth control pill start.  It might be related to irregularity in your cycle that existed before your started the pill.  I really cannot tell based on the limited information provided.  In your case, I would recommend: 1.  Check a pregnancy test 2.  Continue taking the pill daily 3.  Expect that things will regulate over the next 1-2 months 4.  If this does not help, then talk to your doctor about a different pill I hope that this helps and good luck!!"},{"Patient":"I had an IUD for 5 yrs. I required surgical removal. My operative note was mailed to me and at the bottom it says OPERATIVE FINDINGS: exam under anesthesia revealed an 8-10 week size uterus, mobile and ante verged. The cervix was visualized to be without lesions. Hysteroscopic evaluation of the endometrial cavity showed the Mirena IUD to be at the fundus. No endometrial lesions noted. What does this mean? I m confused!","Doctor":"Hello Thank you for your query. It means your cervix was fine, The uterus was slightly enlarged but no abnormality seen. Your IUD was at the funds which is the topmost part of the uterus. It was removed. In essence the findings are normal. Please do not worry. Take care."},{"Patient":"I had a mirena IUD placed on January 4th. This morning while I was still asleep I had a watery discharge . When I woked I thought I had urinated at first. I had a baby in November and have had some bladder control issues since. However, I found that my pajama pants were wet, and there was a slight fishy smell. It was almost the smell I get with a yeast infection , but I am showing no other symptoms. Then after going to the bathroom I stood up and had another, smaller gush. It is definitely the consistency of water. Should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Hello thank you for your query. You could be having urinary incontinence, however the smell you described doesnt fit in. Yeast infection would be a thick curdy discharge, not the watery gushy kinds you describe. The appropriate cause here could be BV or Bacterial Vaginosis, which is also a kind of vaginal infection, characterized by profuse, watery discharge, which typically has a fishy odour. You need to consult a Gynecologist, and have appropriate testing alongwith swabs to pinpoint the precise infection. Do not leave pelvic infections untreated. take care."},{"Patient":"Hello. I have been taking birth control pills for almost a year now. After only taking three of the first week of pills (week after placebo), is there a chance I could be pregnant if I had intercouse on the fourth day of cycle? Also, I continued to take pills, but on one day I took two on accident. One week later, I am experiencing cramps and bloating . Am I pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for using healthcare magic If you have been using the pills consistently then it is unlikely that you are pregnant. Using two pills accidentally would not increase your risk of conceiving but you will need a pill to replace the extra one that was taken. Once the pill is taken daily, including the time set aside to take the placedo, there is a very low chance of pregnancy. If you still are unsure if you are pregnant you can consider taking a home pregnancy test which are usually accurate. I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"hi.just call me shane from philippines.i just wanna ask about this thing i suffering at the moment.my bf took me to a doctor just this last year.and go for that what they called enjection for birth control .that was my first time .the doctor told me it takes only 3months and the enjection will be expired.and ,there s a possible i have no meanstruation or have a meanstruation but only a bit not strong.but since i go to that birth control enjection until now i still have bleeding .about two months already nonstop bleeding but the blood is not strong.what should i do to stop this bleeding?","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for using HCM. It is likely that you were injected a hormonal contraceptive which is  a progesterone. Depo provera is a progesterone hormonal contraceptive that is injected by intramuscular route every 3 months. It however has side effects which include; reduced menses and after a number of doses no menses, spotting or repeated mild blood discharges through the vagina, in some cases occassional heavy bleeding, weight gain, mood swing, headaches, abdominal discomfort , reduced libido etc. The degree of these side effects varies from individual to individual and could be severe necessitating a stop of the injections. However, once the injection has been given, only supportive treatment can be given as it will need just time for the the drug to fade out of the system. For your case, if you experience very heavy bleeding you need to see a doctor, however, the repeated bleeding can improve upon subsequent injections with you not having your menses in later months. Best regards and hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"My girlfriend has been experiencing strange symptoms continuously for months. May these be related, possibly serious, to her taking the birth control , aviane? Her side effects include: Loss of vision (Blurry, usually lasts for 3 minutes to 5), Headache (painful sometimes), and stomach aches (usually because of the headache). Shes been experiencing these symptoms on and off for almost a year now. Shes been taking the pill for about the same time.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to HCM Side effect of birth control pills can be pain abdomen, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, weakness, headache, loss of libido, menstrual irregularities, etc. 1. Get your gf clinically assessed by a doc. She is getting blurry vision, it can be dizziness that she is unable to define, it can be due to weakness, headache can be due to eye-sight problem, she may need an eye check-up. 2. It is important to get her hemoblobin (Hb%) level checked, get her blood tests done to confirm fitness. Low blood pressure often results in headache. 3. She should take vitamin or mineral supplements. 4. She can take some other substitute for the birth control pill that suits her better after consultation with a gynae. 5. Abdominal pain can be due to gastritis. Antacids will give relief. Abdominal pain can also be due to some infection, pelvic inflammatory disease, cysts, fibroid,etc. An USG will help to confirm diagnosis. 6. She should avoid smoking, alcohol or addiction of any kind, avoid oily spicy food. Healthy nutritious, rich in minerals and proteins is what she needs, she should keep bowels clean and properly hydrate herself.

It is advised to wait & try for 1 year before you go for fertility tests. Common Reasons that it might not happen include: - fertilized egg might not travel correctly to uterus - fertilized egg might not get implanted properly in uterus - fertilized egg get dislodged from uterus wall after implanting (as happens in miscarriage) - mismatched timing as mature egg has short life span - low sperm count, particularly if male is smoker. All the above are noted by the female as \\"pregnancy not happening\\", though these are all quite common. If pregnancy doesn't happen in 1 year, you can visit a General/Family physician (GP) who is involved with prenatal/fertility clinic too. GP can advise pelvic ultrasound etc & you don't have to pay for specialist charges. Also, if you are in USA, check in local websites where they advertise about free Obs/Gynec clinics & you can get yourself checked just by registering/enrolling. Meanwhile, try to take healthy balanced diet rich in folate & multivitamins & keep yourself stress-free as far as possible. This helps a lot. Hope this information helps. Please feel free to ask if ou have any specific questions. Wish you good luck!"},{"Patient":"i recived the depo shot 3 days ago this is my second shot the nurse that did it this time told me this was her first time giving this shot when she gave it to me it hurt more then the last one she said not to rub it or itd bruise and i did not rub it and i now have a large bruise, pain and and when you touch around where the bruise is it feels like theres a large hard bump in there and this did not happen the first time should i be worried","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to the forum There is nothing to worry, it will get fine in 1-2 days. You can apply a thin film of neomycin oitment on the bruise. If it is painful you can take an analgesic. Do not scratch or rub. To reduce the inflammation and hardness you can apply thrombophob oitment, it will aid easy blood circulation and reduce the swelling. Do not let the bruise get infected. However, if you see any pus forming, you should take antibiotics to help wound dry up and get well early. If wound remains the same get clinically assessed and treated. When you take the next shot, do not take it in the same spot, take care."},{"Patient":"I m 19 years old and 2 months ago I ve had put a contracepcion implant in my arm , but I m afraid that someting is wrong.

I want to know what to do with it, because it really disrupts my life. Thanks for any answer :)","Doctor":"Hi thereThanks for your queryCerazzette in some women can cause vaginitis, which is inflammation of vagina. Vaginitis from any cause can produce a dark discharge. Other causes of vaginitis should also be considered like infection, non-infectious causes like spray, douches, perfumed soaps, etc.I will also recommend that you go for a pap-smear to rule out lesions of cervix and any infections of cervix and/or uterus.Other causes need to be ruled out by your physician. If the discharge is bad enough then I will recommend that you discuss with your physician about switching to another form of contraception.Hope I addressed your concernThanks"},{"Patient":"I am 23 years old and I have a steady girlfriend since the last 2 years and we have been having regularly having sex. But since the last three months i have noticed that my foreskin has thickened causing the opening end of the foreskin to shrink in size. Because of this, I am not able to pull my foreskin back. So when I have intercourse i usually get a minute cut in the inside of my foreskin which causes pain. I met a couple of doctors, one of them ( a surgeon) said that Il need circumcision. but a dermatologist said that I can use HHZole cream on the thickened part of the foreskin. My question is that the thickened part is situated in the inside of the foreskin so to apply the ointment i have to roll the skin back as much as i can. And after I am done applying, I roll it down to its normal position (over the glans) which causes the cream to come in contact with my glans.Is the cream unsafe for glans? because the cream is said to be used for external use only.","Doctor":"HiYes you can use it on the glans penis it will not have any dangerous effect on glansBut due to inflammation of foreskin you might suffer from phimosis that is the inability of foreskin to retract over the glans leading to pain in glans penis.I actualy agree with your surgeon you should get circumscion done otherwise you will get this issue again and again."},{"Patient":"Hi, I started taking the Depo Provera birth control injection in November of 2011.

Though, increased breast size is not a permanent side effect of it and in most of the cases, breast size returns to normal after stop taking the pill or switch to a low dosage birth control pill (contains only progesterone).

I has nothing for 4 days, then on the 30th Jan, i spotted twice (This was only when i wiped and was very very pale pink, no menstruational signs/pains etc, just very pale pink discharge when i wiped). I had nothing at all on the 31st Jan. Then on the 1st i had brown discharge, wasnt a fully flow period, but this lasted 41-5days. I was using a tampon though just incase. I started taking the pill again on the 9th Feb. I had unprotected sex (pull out method) 3+4 of Jan 2013 and was feeling nausea/tired/moody/emotional and just put it down to the side effects of thie pill. I have recently had a blood test done by my GP and had low iron and Vitamin B12 so i am on tablets for that, but i still feel extremley tired in the afternoon and nauseas too. im just a little confused, are these normal side effects of the Microgynon pill?","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to the forum. You are spotting with brown discharge due to low haemoglobin % in your blood. When there is a deficiency of red blood cells, the uterine endometrium may not be able to form or shed normally. Scanty menstruation is the commonest cause of low Hb% in blood. Fatige, tiredness are symptoms of weakness. Take nutritious diet rich in iron, calcium, protein, nuts, fruits, berries along with appropriate quantity of carbohydrate. Keep well hydrated and take energy drinks. Avoid smoking, alcohol, caffeine or any other addiction. Nausea, vomiting, mood swings, headache, abdominal pains are some common side effects of birth control pills. Continue to take iron and vitamin B12 tabs that your treating doctor has prescribed. Take adequate sleep. You will start getting normal menstruation when your Hb% improves and your general health gets better. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi! I m on birth control , Alesse .

If you skip your OC pills for 2 days the contraceptive efficacious is not guaranteed, hence if you miss 2 days pills the recommendation is to use any additional contraception for 1 week (like barrier contraception like Condom).

Should I be worried about the decreased effectiveness of my pill? Should I run to get an emergency contraceptive if I have had a sexual encounter within the last couple of days?","Doctor":"Hi, There is no need to worry about the decreased efficiency of the pills so long as you take them regularly. The change in the timing does not affect the mechanism of action of the pill. Also, you need not go for the emergency pill as you started your new pack right on time. In fact, use of emergency pill should be restricted to 1 or 2 times a year as it is definitely going to impair the regular hormonal balance of the body and therefore, fertility issues are bound to occur later on.

You may have to change the pills again if you are confirmed of the occurrence of the symptoms due to the pills. You may take anti-emetics and analgesics to relieve the symptoms if uncontrolled.

It is a regular oral contraceptive. If she has regular 28-32 day cycles, you had intercourse during the fertile period, and so, the chances of conception are higher.

It can also potentially cause headaches , depressed mood and weakness. These side effects can occur while on the medication. Since you were due a shot in mid December, it would be almost 2 months since that shot was due and almost 5 months since the last one. It is unlikely that the depo would still be contributing significantly to your symptoms. It may be best, if possible , to visit your doctor for review. i hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi can you tell me please if I have a mirena fitted for Birth control will it mean that I cant have children later on. Is it a sterilizer form of conraception. Also if I suffer from major depression is it advisable to have this type of conraception. is it better to have the injection deprovera every three months rather than the marina.","Doctor":"Hi! Welcome to Healthcare Magic! Thanks for your query. Mirena is an Intrauterine System that releases a hormone to prevent conception. It is NOT a 'sterilizer' form of contraception. It is reversible. When you want to have a baby, you get the mirena removed and you are ready for motherhood. Mirena releases the hormone levonorgesterol to prevent getting pregnant. This hormone can cause depressed mood. This occurs uncommonly though. More importantly, it can worsen mood and may contribute to feeling more emotional ups and downs. If you already have depression, and if the depression is not very well controlled, you may wish to look at other contraceptive solutions. You may need to make regular visits to your Psychiatrist for monitoring your mood while on Mirena. Injection Deprovera is also a hormonal contraceptive. It could have the same effects on your mood as Mirena. I suggest you discuss your options of contraception with your Obstetrician or General Physician. Keep your Psychiatrist informed. All the best.

How long does it take for the implanon wear off?? thanks","Doctor":"Hi welcome to Health care magic forum, Implanon is a good contraceptive devise in IUD type, some times due to improper handling or sterilization it may cause infection . Some times it may be allergic to the body and hence cause such side effects. I advise you to consult a gynaecolagist for diagnosis and treatment, you needto be treated for the infection and pain. Besides i advise you to follow some diet recommendations as take more of green leafy vegetables, pulses , egg and meat to improve blood picture and period irregularity. avoid taking more of spices,  chillies, junk foods, and oily foods to avoid pain abdomen in a natural way. wishing for a quick recovery and thanks for calling."},{"Patient":"I had unprotected sex with my Girlfriend after 2nd day of her period is over 13dec.n she had taken I- Pill 4 day later 17dec.after 5 day of i-pill taken she got bleeding for 5 days 22dec to 27 dec.after tht.now its 31 Jan.her regular period is on 8 Jan.but its 31jan she is not having her period.Mean is she Pregnant?plz help me..","Doctor":"Hi thanks for your question. You had protected sex with your girl friend two days after her periods.She cannot get pregnant from this sexual act, as on one hand it was protected sex and on other hand it took place during her safe period.Reason for not having next cycle in time is simple.She had taken I Pill which disturbed her hormonal profile and she bled for 5 days from December 22 to December 27.So now you calculate her next due period from December 27 onwards.This is normal, menstrual cycle does get disturbed after emergency contraception,there is nothing to worry.

However, the symptoms you mention are commonly found in early pregnancy. If two HPT s are negative, consult a gynecologist, who would examine you and confirm the cause of your problems Take care."},{"Patient":"I m 19. I ve been sexually active for a little while now. I was on the birth control pill Apri, started having bad side effects, so my doctor switched me to the Ortho Evra patch.

Any body know why that might have been? *I also have noticed red-brown discharge just from me.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing to us. The mild reddish brown discharge is a normal finding once you switch the contraceptives. This is likely to subside spontaneously in next few days without any treatment.

I m on microgynon30. Should the pill still cover me as contraception if I m taking it, almost haphazardly, like this?","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing to us. If you are taking the pill on the same day even if it is at haphazard timings, then you are protected against pregnancy.

Irregular menstrual bleeding after discontinuing the depo shot is very common. Also, nausea is also common. However, all your symptoms could point to a possible pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy. Kindly consult your healthcare provider immediately for a check up and ultrasound evaluation. Take care."},{"Patient":"My periods returned 3rd December 12 after having my baby in April 12. It was considerably lighter and less painful than post pregnancy periods. I had unprotected sex on 6th January 13 and then my second post pregnancy period came on 7th January 13. I am still breastfeeding but my baby is now weaning and eats solids and feeds less from the breast with supplemented formulae once or twice a day. My question is is it possible at all for me to be pregnant? The period following the intercourse was again light- medium flow and not too painful. I had cramping on 20th - 21st Jan and it was quite uncomfortable and had a break out of pimples and moodiness around this time. I assumed it was ovulation pain but am now wondering if it could have been implantation cramps which I had with my first conception . Perhaps it is just all my body returning to fertile and my periods are going to resume as usual but I have some symptoms that have got me suspicious. These include nausea, one bout of sickness after a car journey, extreme fatigue and moodiness/irritation. I also have been more tearful than normal and seem to have extra saliva again. Now today I have had to un zip my jeans even though I have not put on weight?! Could all this just be my hormones changing back or am I at all likely to be pregnant? If there is a possibility of being pregnant, when would a test show as positive given my dates of intercourse etc? Thank you in anticipation for any answers you can help me with.","Doctor":"Hello Thanks for the query, Hcg can be detected by a blood test as early as 11 days after conception . And about 12 - 14 days after conception by a urine test. In general the hCG levels will double every 72 hours. The level will reach its peak in the first 8 - 11 weeks of pregnancy and then will decline and level off for the remainder of the pregnancy. Since you have started to ovulate there are chances that you could be pregnant. Get your urine pregnancy test done. If it is positive, consult your doctor for further course.

Is it possible that it has already expired? Thank you for your help!","Doctor":"Hello Thanks for your query on the portal. If the proper storage temperature specified on the pack is not maintained, it is possible that the pills would not produce desired effect. Also, sometimes, if your body weight is high, the pills might be of a lesser dose than you require, causing breakthrough bleeding. Plus, abnormal bleeding , even if on pills, requires investigation, as it might point to an unintentional pregnancy or other pathologies. Please consult your healthcare provider.

Normally return to fertility after stopping pill use occurs within 1 - 2 months, however there is a condition called post pill amenorrhoea, where you might not get regular periods for upto 6 months.

The pain goes from mild to slightly unbearable from time to time and during this time I sometimes feel nautious. I have complained to my GP on numerous occasion and without any checks they ll say it s either a bladder infection or ovulation pain. I have even informed them that on one occasion I was informed that I should have a TV Ultra sound , however it has fallen on deaf ears. Both my partner and I are getting stressed about this and not having an answer to any checks done to determine what my problem is. Could please you advise??","Doctor":"First of all don't worry and relax,get a TVS ultrasound as was advices to you or get a whole abdomen sonography done. The causes of pain with nausea can be due to appendicitis or small stone in the urinary tract or ovulation or a cyst in the ovary. With the sonography and a simple urine test to rule out urinary infection might give an answer to your queries ,so get them done and consult your doctor for further advice."},{"Patient":"I got the depo shot December 1st and since then have not had a regular period.

Could I be pregnant, or is this just side effects from the Depo?","Doctor":"hi there am dr.surendiran nice to meet you here in HCMagic If you have been off your Depo shot and if you were having regular periods, it would suggest regular ovulation. If you had been sexually active without protect, chances of pregnancy could be possible and the early and altered bleeding that you describe could be the probable implantation bleeding. Observe your current bleeding/periods. If bleeding is heavy, getting worse, or if associated with abdominal cramps and presence of clots, it could also suggest possible early miscarriage. Look out for development of any other new symptoms. Visit your doctor/gynecologist for further evaluation, clarification and assistance.

Could I be pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello, When taken correctly, birth control pills can be up to 99% effective in preventing pregnancy. However, women who are taking birth control pills do on rare occasions get pregnant. When this happens, it is most often because of something the women did (or, more likely, did not do), not because the pill itself somehow failed to work. One may miss some dose and forget it or you might vomit it out or if you are taking some other medicine like anti seizure medicine or some herbal medicine or some antibiotic,rendering it less effective. You can definitely be pregnant however you may confirm it again by doing pregnancy test by both the ways,urine as well as blood estimation of beta HCG. The accidental increased dose of ELTROXIN has no relation with your pregnancy. Thanks"},{"Patient":"My wife is using Asmita Contraceptive Pill on regular basis. She takes it for 21days.

Due to our holiday tour she wants to delay her period by using new pack without stopping in between two packs. Does she is right ? Will this make any problem to conceive later ?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for the query. The gap between the packs is meant for occurrence of withdrawal bleeding in general. And yes, she can postpone her periods by skipping the gap and starting the fresh pack. Usually this will not cause any problem in fertility later. After stoppage of contraceptive pills, it may take sometime for returning of the ovulation. Once she gets regular ovulation she can conceive naturally.

Now i seem to be suffering from recurring thrush. I have increased my water intake, stopped using soaps and also had a script from my gp, for the tablet to help clear up my thrush. Which has only served to clear it up for about a week. It is very strong smelling down there and i m beginning to get worried even though my doc said there is nothing to worry about. Can you help with any other ideas ?","Doctor":"Hello, There can be various reasons for recurrent thrush in you. 1...The symptoms may not be due to thrush,as generally thrush infection is not smelly.There are other causes of a vaginal discharge like a bacterial vaginosis or a mixed infection.You may need tests such as vaginal swabs to clarify the cause of the symptoms. 2....Most bouts of thrush are caused by Candida albicans. However, about 1 in 10 bouts of thrush is caused by other strains of Candida spp., such as Candida glabrata. These may not be so easily treated with the usual anti-thrush medicines. 3.....You may not have used the treatment correctly. 4....recurrence is  more likely if you are taking antibiotics, or if you have undiagnosed or poorly controlled diabetes. 5... Change in vaginal pH. Consult your doctor and get the vaginal swab done to know the exact cause for the infection.

All the best."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, I m having a few issues with my health at the moment and I can t tell if it s extreme coincidence they re all happening at the same time or whether something more serious is happening. My first issue (and what I think is the most important) is that I ve been taking the pill for almost a year and a half now and I m getting some abnormal bleeding . I missed a couple (not in a row) over Christmas and I got my period early and it s still here nearly two weeks later. I skipped the sugar pills and just continued active pills as the pack and doctors suggest. It s mostly concerning as I m getting an IUD inserted in a weeks time, so I want to know if I have to cancel my appointment. My second issue is that I ve had a cold for near two months. This is not that abnormal for myself, I work in an environment where I often have colds all year round, but this one is getting on my nerves. I ve been healthy recently and have started exercising and eating better and thought I was getting better (I went without a cold for a while, which was strange to me) but now it s back and I just can t kick it. My final issue is my mood. I m aware PMS etc can change your mood, but this is serious mood swings unlike I ve ever had. I have lost all my motivation for my studies and don t want to be anywhere near people at all. I am overtired (which could be the cold) and thoughts are keeping me up most of the night, making me extremely fatigued. I m hoping you can give me some insight as to what is going on, and hopefully some tips to make myself better. I m normally a very cheery, energetic person.","Doctor":"Hello thanks for writing in. Missing a pill, and even otherwise, on birth control pills, it is not rare to have irregular/abnormal bleeding or spotting. Do not cancel your appointment, as even with mild spotting, IUD can be inserted, but do not do it pre menstrually, as IUD is best inserted after a period is over. Regarding your mood swings, frequent colds, tiredness etc., please take vitamin C and vitamin D supplements. Also get your thyroid profile checked. Do away with any stress/ anxiety /emotional upheaval. You can try yoga / relaxation breathing/ meditation. Also, eat healthy, eat right and exercise in moderation Take care."},{"Patient":"My husband and I went off birth control 2 months ago after being on for 7 years.

Then a few days later we had sex again and I had a little bleeding after we were done is this something to worry about or is it just my body getting used to being off the pill? (I m 25)","Doctor":"Hello It is very common after using the birth control for years, to have altered menstrual bleeding on stopping its use, This is because the hormonal effects take time to wear off. However, bleeding after intercourse is definitely not normal. It could point to some local lesion on the cervix I would advise you to go for a check up for post coital bleeding.

(Headache, nausea , weight gain/loss, tenderness etc). I had an operation a year ago where i had to have a cyst and one of my ovaries out but i was told it was ok to stay on the injection. I just come off the injection because i would like to see that my remaining ovary is working ok and read somewhere that i shouldn t be on it for more than 2 years at a time, but would like to be prepared for the side effects/know what to expect.

Usually many women can experience these type of side effects, but these will subside soon with out need of medication generally.

Birth control pills can cause menstrual irregularities like inter-menstrual spotting, delayed or absent periods etc. So your symptoms can be because of this. Usually pills should be started from the first day of the periods for complete protection.

If you miss the pill and take two pills in the next day complete protection can be expected as per the manufacturers. Taking the pills at the same time everyday will increase the percentage of protection. If you take the pill three hours after the expected time the efficacy can decrease to some extent.

Having unprotected intercourse while your period is going on, results in very low chances of pregnancy. Also, how long ago did you remove the Nuvaring ?

Stress can have an effect on cycles and cause irregular bleeding, but this is unlikely to be a factor in this case in the setting of the birth control that you are on.  Clindamycin has no effect on its effectiveness either and is likely not the cause of the abnormal bleeding.

They are so obviously linked to the insertion of the coil, and yet not mentioned on the pack at all. Any advice??? Thanks","Doctor":"It'a also a possible side effect since Mirena has an hormonal component which is causing the increased sweating, it's important if this symptoms get worse everyday and become intolerable you visit your OBGYN to suggest an alternative method an get it removed. I also advice you comment with your doctor about the side effect not being in the label so they can submit an inquiry with the company."},{"Patient":"Hi! I took Lady pills prior to sex but it was still my 2nd day. I was very much worried because the condom was torn. I bought Nordette 21-pill pack with the dosage of 150mcg/30mcg. That s the only available dosage in my country. I ve read some blogs that Nordette should be 28 pills and it has a light orange color with a different dosage of what I bought. The Nordette pill I bought has white color. I m so worried. I took 4 pills 30 hours after the unprotected sex then took another 4 pills after 12 hours. Is the Nordette pill the same as the one advertised as emergency contraception? Please help","Doctor":"Hi vilcebrenede welcome to HCM, Nordette is a combined oral contraceptive pill composed of 150microgram of levonorgesterol and 30 microgram of ethinylestradiol (or) 0.15milligram and 0.03milligram respectively and the pills can be of either white colour or orange colour.... Actually those 21 pills are the contraceptive pills and the remaining 7 are iron tablets so it can contain either 21 or 28 pills.... Nordette can be taken as emergency pill upto 72 hours after unprotected intercourse and the dose you took is same, so it is safe only... Now coming to lady pills, if you have taken(taking) the lady pills regularly they offer an effective protection against pregnancy. So in all aspects you are safe now and nothing to worry..........

As I see, you had been advised to take Nordette as an emergency contraceptive. We would like you to know that if would be better if you take these medicines after consulting a Doctor. Stronger doses are contraindicated without consulting a Doctor and you should not go for it at any cost. In future, you can go for other methods of birth control like regular contraceptive pills, condoms, diaphragms etc. Although the efficacy of emergency contraceptive pills is quite high, it can fail in few cases.

I dropped the Friday pill of the first week and wasn t able to take it. So I picked up a new pack the following day and took the missed friday pill I dropped as soon as I received it and took the Saturday pill at the correct time that day. My husband and I had sex on Saturday night. Sunday morning I woke up a tad nautious and had strange cramps in my lower stomach . Should I be worried? Or does it have something to do with missing the pill?","Doctor":"Hello I appreciate your query. Ideally speaking, when you miss  a pill, you should take it the next day, alongwith the pill due on the next day as well ie. two pills the next day, plus the remainder of the pack as prescribed. This you have already done, so no issues. However, the important thing is, to use a backup method, such as condoms, for the rest of the month, before beginning a new pack the following month. You mentioned that this was not done. However, the mild symptoms you mention, are mostly non specific, and have nothing to do with missing a pill. Maybe due to taking a double dose of pills the day before. Please use barrier method for the rest of the cycle to ensure complete protection. Also, just in case you miss your period, perform an early HCG urine pregnancy test. Chances of conception are more if the unprotected intercourse occurred around the time of your ovulation. All the best."},{"Patient":"I have just started with crisanta as contraceptive from the first day of periods after a check up by my doctor last month. now the thing is i had undergone an unprotected sex on 10 th and 12thday of my periods .Is there any possibilty to concieve where in iam already taking crisanta every day. how safe is crisanta for the first time user to avoid pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for the query. As you started the contraceptive pills from the first day of your periods and used as per schedule, it will give protection from pregnancy. With proper use of pills you can get protection from first day onwards. The failure rate of contraceptive pills is very low. So no need to bother.

Firstly, after one missed pill, you should take two on the next day. And use barrier method as a back up method, while finishing your pack for the rest of the month. However, in your panic, you have already taken too many pills, excessive dose in fact. I am surprised you didnt have any nausea / side effects. You have already taken sufficient dose to act as emergency contraception also. Please do not take any more pills all together Finish the rest of this month's pills normally ( one daily ), and use barrier ( condoms ) method for the rest of your cycle. Wait for your next period, as consuming more pills mindlessly will not help you now. Also, with such a high dose of pills, you could have your period earlier than usual. If you miss your period, perform a pregnancy test at the earliest, and opt for medical abortion, if you do not want a pregnancy. Take care."},{"Patient":"I ended my period two weeks ago, and started spotting about a week ago.

Also, I ve been having pretty bad tension-like (I think) headaches that begin in the afternoon around 4-6 and get worse as the night progresses. I m wondering if these are related, as I am going through a very stressful time right now, or if it could be something else.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for the query. Stress and strain can alter the hormones by affecting hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian axis. Which can cause menstrual irregularity like inter-menstrual spotting, bleeding etc. Contraceptive pills can also lead to menstrual irregularities. So now you continue your pills as usual and try to be tension-free. If the same problem repeats in future better to consult doctor once. Take care."},{"Patient":"I ve been on birth control for little over a month, I don t take it at the exact time everyday but I do take it every morning. Yesterday my boyfriend came inside me and I was wondering if I should stop take birth control. I think the chance of me getting pregnant is slim, but I kind of want to be pregnant. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello, I appreciate your query. Since you have been taking birth control pills regularly, chances of your conceiving immediately if you stop pills is slim Also, chances of pregnancy are more if you miss the pill and have unprotected sex around your days of ovulation ( normally day 14 if you have a 28 day cycle - the unsafe days are 3 days before and 3 days after ovulation ). If you want to conceive, stop birth control pills after finishing the current pack. Wait for your next period, take adequate pre conceptional counselling and then plan your pregnancy systematically. Return to fertility sometimes takes a few months in case of pills, however that is not always the case , and you might get pregnant earlier.

But this November i should be getting my period on November 26 ( i got my last period last October 26) but until now i didn t get it yet. I did check it using home pregnancy test 3 X now in different days but it still show negative. Am i pregnant but too early to check or did my irregular period came back? Thank You","Doctor":"Hello, it\`s more likely your irregular periods have come back. This often happens. Women are prescribed the pill to correct irregular periods. Just after stopping the pill your periods can be quite normal (this is the best time to try and fall pregnant) - but after a few periods the irregulairites kick back in. So, be prepared for the menstrual cycle irregularities to continue - if you\`re looking to get pregnant you migh want to see a specialist as you might need an ultrascan and some hormone tests.Not all insurance companies will pay for that straight away.

My e-mail add is:- YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hi, inserting an intrauterine device after child birth is usually done around 6-8 weeks after birth. Because the uterus is back down to it\`s normal size then. The doctors won\`t insert it directly after birth - as the uterus still has to shrink back down to the normal size and any intrauterine device wouldn\`t be \\" held\\" by the uterus. Most women won\`t have sex during those 6-8 weeks - as you are still postpartum - having postpartum discharge which is first red and slowly turns a different color until it stops after about 6-8 weeks. You can usually talk to the doctor at your postnatal check up - or just after the birth so that the insertion can be organised for you ahead of time.

In case of difficult insertion and/or exceptional pain or bleeding during or after insertion, physical examination and ultrasound should be performed immediately to exclude perforation of the uterine corpus or cervix.

There are various causes of amenorrhoea ( absence of periods ) apart from pregnancy. Firstly, you need to consult a gynecologist to confirm that you are really not pregnant, as home tests are not 100 % reliable. Secondly, you have mentioned that you are overweight. Obesity also leads to menstrual irregularities. You have not mentioned your age. If you are peri menopausal, such menstrual delays are also to be expected. Certain hormonal imbalances such as thyroid disorders, anemia, adrenal disorders or sugar imbalances might contribute to your problems. If you have a history of multiple abortions and surgical terminations, the uterine lining might be thinned out and you might have this problem. There is an entity called premature ovarian failure wherein the periods stop earlier than usual for a woman's age. You must consult a practitioner at the earliest, and get your various tests and investigations as suggested above by me, in addition to a pelvic examination to know the cause of your amenorrhoea. Meanwhile, weight reduction, moderate and regular exercise and a healthy diet will certainly contribute to your well being. Hope this helped you."},{"Patient":"My gal friend took i- pill after (5-10)minutes of unprotected sex, pregnant or safe?

The chances of pregnancy here depend on a lot of things. If intercourse occurred between the 10th and 20th days of the menstrual cycle, then chances of pregnancy are high. For eg., if the female had her period on 1st November, and you had intercourse between 10th and 20th of November, the chances of getting pregnant are very high compared to other days. Also, Ipill was taken immediately after unprotected intercourse, hence you have already done your best to prevent pregnancy. Nothing further can be done right now to prevent pregnancy. You will have to wait till the date of her next menstrual period, in order to confirm whether she has conceived inspite of the Ipill. If she does cross the date of her expected periods, kindly perform a Urine Pregnancy Test to rule out a pregnancy. However, with one random encounter of unprotected intercourse, plus the timely intake of Ipill, in my personal opinion, the chances of pregnancy are very low. And you definitely can do nothing about it now, apart from the Ipill, which you have already taken. Hence, you should relax and wait for her period. Meanwhile, ensure that further such episodes of unprotected intercourse are avoided. Hope this helped you."},{"Patient":"I am 32 years old , five feet ten inches in height, 64 kg in weight.

There is less possibility for pregnancy. As: -You are on birth control pills with regular usage. -Had intercourse before the onset of periods.

Implanon is a hormonal device. Side effects of implanon use include lighter, irregular and infrequent bleeding. Sometimes there are no periods at all which is not accountable to pregnancy if the device was used in the right way. So your pink discharge can be due to the side effect of implanon. Nausea, headache, sore breasts and weight gain are also seen with implanon use. Smoking does not affects the contraceptive efficacy of implanon but it does predispose you to serious side effects associated with implanon like stroke and blood clots. So it is better if you stop smoking with implanon in situ. You can test for pregnancy just to be sure. Secondly I want you to visit your gynecologist for an internal examination so as to rule out other causes of unexpected vaginal bleeding (pink discharge). A Pap smear is also mandatory if you have not done in the past one year.

There are a number of causes for galactorrhea, including oral contraceptives such as Femilon and Cerazette. Interestingly, some women develop galactorrhea when they stop taking estrogen-containing medications, such as Femilon, and switch to progestogen-only preparations, such as Cerazette. Once galactorrhea develops, it's important to avoid stimulating your nipples, as this perpetuates the problem. Thus, you shouldn't squeeze your nipples, and make sure your bras fit well and don't cause nipple chafing. If your nipple discharge recurs, see your physician for an evaluation. I hope that answers your question!"},{"Patient":"I ve been taking tri-Sprintec for a 13months now. I missed one of my pill the other day. So the next day I took two pills instead of 1. But the problem is now I had unprotected sex and he cum inside me. Now im worried that I could be pregnant? Please help me. This just happen yesterday? Should I take the morning after pill or should I just wait?","Doctor":"Hello. Whether you need backup birth control after missing a birth control pill depends on where you were in your pack when you missed the pill. For combination BCPs like Tri-Sprintec, if you miss one of the first two pills in the pack, you should take the forgotten pill as soon as you remember and the next at its usual time (just like you did). You should then use a backup method of birth control (e.g., condoms) for one week. If you missed a pill from day 3 through 21 of your pack, you should take the forgotten pill as soon as you remember it and the next at its usual time (as above). Backup birth control is not required in this case. If you missed one of the inactive pills (the white ones), you don't need to take the forgotten pill, and no backup birth control is needed. Given those scenarios, you can decide whether you need emergency contraception. Specifically, if you missed one of the first two pills of your pack and had unprotected sex within a week, you should take emergency contraception. Otherwise, emergency contraception isn't indicated. I hope that answers your question!"},{"Patient":"i hve been taking postinor-2 after sexual intercourse since we dont use any other types of contraceptive (eg:condom,diaphragm)..so far i ve been using it twice in 2 months..so i would like to know..will the postinor-2 cause any serious long term effects like alteration of my endometrium that will be hard for me to conceive in the future?","Doctor":"Hi Bella Welcome to HCM Postinor 2 is a contraceptive pill for emergency use and not as a reular contrception pills.

If the periods are irregular , it is more difficult to pinpoint the exact time.In most women ovulation would not have occured by day 8 but having said that, it is possible to get pregnant at any time in the cycle, the chances are just greater at different times. White curdy discharge is usually a sign of a yeast infection which can easily be treated, yeast infections can occur in the absence of pregnancy. Signs and symptoms in early pregnancy include: fatigue, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, breast tenderness.

Thank you","Doctor":"Hello. Congratulations on your recent delivery. Couples who rely on breastfeeding to prevent another pregnancy are taking a bit of a chance. Many nursing mothers begin ovulating within two to three months of delivery, while others may not ovulate for a year or more. The problem is, there's no way to predict when you, personally, will become fertile again, so you could actually ovulate, conceive and get pregnant without ever having a period. Thus, if you want to prevent pregnancy you should at least use condoms, and you may want to talk to your doctor about other forms of birth control. Now, your breast pain might be a symptom of mastitis, which is a common problem in breastfeeding mothers. Mastitis is caused by a bacterial infection in the milk ducts of your breast, and it can often be managed by simply applying warm packs to the breast. It's okay to continue feeding your baby from both breasts, even if you have mastitis. If your breast tenderness doesn't improve within a couple of days, see your doctor; you might need an antibiotic to get things cleared up. I hope that helps. Enjoy your baby boy!"},{"Patient":"Hi Ive been using microgynon for 16 years and have had breaks only when trying to get pregnant, and of course during my 2 pregnancies.

I dont really like the thought of taking pills and having chemicals in my body all the time","Doctor":"Hello. The concerns you have about your birth control pills are shared by a lot of women -- and by lots of health experts, too. Some studies have shown that long-term use of oral contraceptives slightly increases the risk for certain kinds of cancer, such as liver and cervical cancer. On the other hand, using birth control pills for a long time appears to decrease the risk for uterine and ovarian cancer. The data showing a link between oral contraceptives and breast cancer is inconsistent: some studies suggest a slight increase in the risk for breast cancer, while others don't. At this point in time, most experts agree that women can take oral contraceptives for as long as they need birth control or until they reach menopause, as long as they're otherwise healthy and don't smoke. (Women over the age of 35 who smoke shouldn't take birth control pills.) Your doctor, who is familiar with your medical history, is best qualified to review other birth control options with you, including IUDs (both hormonal and non-hormonal), implantable forms (e.g. Implanon), injectable hormones (Depo-Provera), patches, vaginal rings, barrier methods, and both progestin-only and combination oral agents.

There are mainly 4 Hormones which comes into act- 1. Oestrogen 2. progesterone 3. LH 4. FSH During a normal cycle this 4 maintain a perfect balance. First few days the Oestrogen maintain the endometrium but during the mid cycle there is sudden rise in FSH and LH which causes Ovulation. Then again oestrogen takes the control and progesteron also play a role. Then the level decrases and endometrium can not maintain  itself thus menstruation occurs. Now when you using this throughout the cycle you are suplementing oestrogen and progesterone from outside thus no LH & FSH surge- no ovulation. After 21st day the rest 7 tablets are nothing but iron tablets , so during this time no hormonal support from outside so similar situation arises like menstruation endometrium can not maintain itself. These occurs due to withdrawl of hormonal support thus this is called WITHDRAWL BLEEDING.

I was diagnosed with epididymitis about a year and a half ago and went through multiple trials of antibiotics and anti inflammatory medicine. Some trials came with a little relief but pain and swelling would return after about a month. I also had an ultrasound which showed nothing abnormal. After about 6 months of dealing with epididymitis doctors diagnosed me with chronic prostatitis.

It's been about 3 or 4 months since I've been back and my pelvic pain is still minimal, however I still have great pain and swelling in both of my epididymis. I can feel that the coils are very swollen and the actual epididymis is swollen and hard.

I am a 23 year old male having this issue or concern for about almost 2 years. It first started during the summer before the past one with pain on my right testicle and constipation. I looked around online and I see that constipation may cause testicular pain. At the beginning the pain was on the right top of testicle and side. It was not a 24/7 pain. it comes goes. but most of the day around 90% of the time I had pain. Since I did not have insurance I did not consult with the doctor. I did take home remedies such as prune juice, dates, and sometime tried dulcolax for the constipation, eventhough it did not work as I needed. Once I got the insurance about a year later I went to the doctor, but testicle pain was not bad as it was before but constipation got worse. Once I did couple of appointments with the doctor he prescribed me to do a colonoscopy and result came back negative. They said it is IBS. Since I had/have gas trouble also they did endoscopy only thing it showed on the endoscopy was some marks were on my beginning of the throat. He took a biopsy of it and result came back negative. Also we did ultrasound of the abdomen and it came back negative as well.  Once the testicle pain came back again my doctor prescribed me to a urologist and he did a physical examination and told there is an infection on my epididymis. prescribed me sulfamethadoxale tmp ds for three weeks and it didnt satisfy what my problem. He then did a ultrasound and only thing he found out was there is extra fluid but that is something not worry about and that is not the reason of your pain I am worrying about. About the sexual activity. Due to my backpain, One time I went to spa where they offered masterbation I received it. with my gf I just had oral sex. So since this is something I was worrying about urologist did test for chlamydia and gonorrhea and both result came back negative. I have lost around 15 pounds from the day I saw my physician and I was in so much worried and tensed during these days. As of now my condition is this, sometimes i get narrow bowel movement(amount of total stool- only a little), sometimes thick one in the beginning and small pieces after that, sometimes I have abdominal pain, left side of my stomach feels something blocking there, gas, bloating(not always but quite often). Mucus on my stool(some time)Urination- sometimes too often, when I push hard to go to bathroom I have clear discharge from my penis, 3-5 times I have seen white mucus in my urine.  some times I have seen my urine is cloudy. When I go to bathroom in the morning, I have seen that my testicle gets larger and feels that all the fluids filled in there that is really uncomfortable. I feel pain or discomfort on right side of the groin it only happens some times and feel pain and discomfort behind the testicle. I do have gas/bloating. I do have a doubt if I lost appetite or not. Any kind of inputs are appreciated in advance. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.

The location is about two finger widths to the right of my belly button. I have had this sensation for a few months now but it was very subtle, it is now growing stronger and is accompanied by nausea. I find that if I push on the location the nausea mildly subsides but returns after release. There is a flutter sensation as well as tugging and it is very isolated. I have been diagnosed with a hiatial hernia a year ago, lymphatic hyperplasia and a spermatocele but besides that no other illnesses. Blood work shows no signs of infection or peaked numbers that would cause concern as well as ultrasound could not find any noteworthy masses or obstructions. I have had an endoscopy and a colonoscopy and gallbladder test. The gallbladder test shows its within optimal paramaters as well as no stones or obstructions. Diet is low carb low sugar with no stimulant intake other than a cup of coffee every once in awhile. No alcohol or smoking as well as any other recreational stimulants. I have noticed no weight loss or substantial changes in physique however when I am feeling nauseous I also feel very faint and weak. My Primary care Dr as well as my Gastroenterologist believe I am fine and experiencing an upset stomach from diet induced reflux or agitation however given the prominence of the symptoms and the demand of attention from the very specific location and the growing level of fatigue and nausea I am beginning to become quite concerned. I am not one to jump to conclusions or make hasty decisions and will continue doing research on this as much as I can but I would like to know if you or anyone has any thoughts on what may be causing this as well as some tests or requests I could ask my Drs to see if we can diagnose what is causing these symptoms?I am most grateful for your time and thank you for any insight or thoughts you may have.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.

I am someone very much aware of the symptoms of HIV, so for three months, I monitored my body. No early signs. But six months later, I saw two patches on my lower legs and robbed them. They became wounds. I was scared and rushed to the urgent clinic for attention. They checked and said nothing. Two nights later, I had chill and sweating on the face. My throat is really dry, though no sore throat, only a little dry cough. I went to my doctor and complained. He gave me augmentine antibiotics. After another week, I noticed rashes on my laps and tiny reddish-like colouration on my chest whenever I finished taking my bath, then scratchings on both my palms and under my feet. I also noticed that I have achings from my waist down my legs. I went to my doctor and complained.  I also told him about my flatulent stomach which has lasted almost two years now, and a back pain also lasting up to two yars. He said they weren't anything to panic about. But I told him about the sex six months ago, requesting an HIV test. But instead, I saw something like 'cadiovascular risk, urine, glucose' written on the paper. No HIV. Today is the second day since I visited my doctor. And rightnow, I see that the right part of my knees is slightly swollen from the back, a little painful. I also seem to notice that my tongue doesn't taste same. And the date for the said test is January 13th. What could I do in a situation like this?

Throughout tiday, the pain has stayed. it s a dull pain, and stings slightly when I urinate. could this just be because my penis was obstructed during an erection? is a jockstrap a good way to contain erections? and if not, are there other solutions?

Masturbation in one session for a long period of time may also result in pelvic congestion which may lead to pain.2. Pain may also be related to how you are positioning yourself during masturbation. If your testicles are moving around too much, this motion could be the reason behind your discomfort. Consider a change in position or try cupping your testicles with your free hand as you are masturbating. This touch could also benefit by providing extra sensation and may make the experience more enjoyable.3. Epididymitis can also be a source of testicular pain following ejaculation. This is caused by inflammation in the epididymis (the tube behind each testicle that stores and delivers sperm). The most common cause of epididymitis is a bacterial infection that can be the result of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or coliforms (bacteria that live in the intestines).

Ejaculation: many experience split urination hours after they have had an ejaculation. This is said to be one of the most common causes of this condition. How does this happen? During ejaculation, semen is ejected through the male urethra to the outside of the body. As the semen passes through the urethra, some get stuck in the tube and get dry. And since urine also passes through the same urethra that semen passes through, the dry semen acts as an obstruction and causes the urine to split into two while you are peeing.2. Low pee pressure: When the pressure of the urine is not high then the stream of urine can easily split.3. Congenital urethral fistula: the name sounds quite serious and so is its effect. This is a medical condition that comes as a result of a birth defect.4.

Tamsulosin is an alpha-1 adrenoreceptor blocker specifically for the muscles in the bladder neck, prostate and urinary pathways.

Other causes of obstructive azoospermia include ejaculatory duct obstruction (EDO) that can result from chronic prostatitis, prostatic calcification, and compression of the ducts by cysts in the prostate or seminal vesicle.Non-obstructive azoospermia can result from hormonal abnormalities or other disorders that affect spermatogenesis (the process of developing mature sperm cells). This type of azoospermia can be caused by genetic abnormalities (such as Klinefelter Syndrome or Y chromosome abnormalities), or it may be acquired due to infection, trauma, cancer, or radiation.

It itches only a bit now, used to itch a lot a couple of weeks ago but is better now. Plus there is dirt like i havent washed it in days just over-night. What is it?","Doctor":"hellothank you for trusting HCMDear many causes for dry flaky itchy skin on penis.most common causes are1. friction:Dry masturbation, prolonged sexual activity, and even constant rubbing against clothing all create heat and friction. These can strip away the body’s natural lubricating oils, leaving the skin feeling dry and parched. Dry skin is also more susceptible to surface-level damage, meaning that even normal activities can cause microscopic tears in the outer layers of the skin; this can result in a penis that is sore and tender to the touch.2.Allergic Reactions — Skin allergies and contact dermatitis (eczema) can cause skin irritation, rash, flaking and dryness that can be difficult to combat. Some common culprits that cause adverse skin reactions may include the chemicals found in laundry detergents, soaps, latex, spermicides, deodorants and fragrances. Plants such as poison ivy, poison oak, and even ordinary grass can also cause allergic reactions in some men.3.Soap or body wash – Even in men who do not have allergies to the chemicals found in some personal care products, regular body bars and shower gels can cause dryness and extreme irritation of the penile skin. These products often contain detergents that are designed to clean away sweat, grease, and dirt, but may also strip the skin of its natural protective oils.4.Yeast Infections — While yeast infections (caused by the Candida albicans fungus) are more common in women, men can also be affected. Individuals who have a depressed immune system due to diabetes or other systemic disorders, who are undergoing chemotherapy, or who are taking certain medications may be more prone, but yeast infections (also known as thrush) can happen to anyone. Aside from dryness and peeling, symptoms can include painful cuts or fissures in the skin’s surface, as well as a thick, pasty or chunky discharge.so please avoid allergen,use moisturizer cream,use candid b gel for local application,if symptoms not improved please consult your dermatologist he/she will examine and treat you accordingly.

PHIMOSIS is a congenital narrowing of the opening of the foreskin so that it cannot be retracted. Phimosis is a very common problem. In most of the cases you can clear the problem yourself.  Phimosis could cause moderate to severe pain while having vaginal intercourse. Apply oil on your foreskin and on the glans. Move the foreskin forward and back slowly without hurting you much. Because the oil is lubricant, it will be easier than without oil. Do this forward and back movement 20 times several times in a day. Repeat the same every day for around one month. You will get the elasticity and you will be able to retract the foreskin completely.

Blood in semen commonly might occur due to any internal injury which might get relieved on its own in due course of time. Other ominous causes which are more common in old age are tumors or infections including tuberculosis. However in developed countries tuberculosis is not that common. Wait for some days and then get your semen analysis done in any reputed lab. The finding might suggest infection if associated with increased pus cells. Or it might clear up by then.

Some more serious issues such as tumors and carcinomas are less common but should be considered if there is pain and rapid growth of it.

Thank you for the query.Urgent urination describes an overwhelming need to get to a restroom immediately. It may be accompanied by pain or discomfort in the bladder or urinary tract. Urinary tract infections are the most common cause of frequent or urgent urination. Other causes include: drinking too much liquid, drinking caffeinated or alcoholic beverages, diabetes, pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, when there is pressure on the bladder medications, vaginal infections or prostate enlargement. It’s possible that frequent or urgent urination could be normal for you if you don’t have other symptoms. The treatment plan for frequent or urgent urination is largely dependent on the cause. Antibiotics can help treat infections. Lifestyle changes such as monitoring liquid consumption and urine output or adjusting medications can help some people.Kindly regards.

Thank you for your query. I am Dr. Rommstein, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I canWell, jaundice is just a sign and not diseases, and treatment depends on exact cause.Jaundice is usually sign of certain liver disease and high bilirubin value.  Causes of jaundice vary from non-serious to potentially fatal. Levels of bilirubin in blood are normally below 1.0 mg/dL (17 µmol/L) and levels over 2-3 mg/dL (34-51 µmol/L) typically results in jaundice. High bilirubin may be due to liver diseases such as cirrhosis or hepatitis, infections, medications, orblockage of the bile duct In the developed world the cause is more often blockage of the bile duct or medications. Blockage of the bile duct may occur due to gallstones, cancer, or pancreatitis. Medical imaging such as ultrasound is useful for detecting bile duct blockage.Treatment of jaundice is typically determined by the underlying cause. If a bile duct blockage is present surgery is typically required, otherwise management is medical.Medical management may involve treating infectious causes and stopping medication that could be contributing.

They usually go all the way around the penis head in one or two rows. These lumps are normal. They are not sexually transmitted or caused by bad hygiene. They don’t cause symptoms and don’t require treatment.Fordyce spotsFordyce spots are small yellowish or white spots on the head or shaft of the penis. Fordyce spots are sebaceous glands (tiny glands found near the surface of your skin) without hair follicles. They can also appear on the inside of the cheeks or on the lips, and are present in 80-95% of adults. Fordyce spots are generally harmless and don’t need treatment.LymphoceleThis is a hard swelling that suddenly appears on the shaft of the penis after sex or masturbation. It happens when the lymph channels in your penis are temporarily blocked. Lymph is a clear fluid that forms part of the body’s immune system. The swelling should soon subside and will not cause any permanent problems.Lichen planusLichen planus is a non-infectious, itchy rash of purple-red bumps that can affect many areas of the body, including the penis.Genital wartsGenital warts are small fleshy growths or bumps that can appear on the shaft, and sometimes head, of the penis or under the foreskin. They are caused by the human papilloma virus sexually transmitted infection (STI).Sores or ulcersA painful blister or sore on your penis could be caused by herpes, which is an STI caused by the herpes simplex virus. A painless sore or ulcer on your penis could be caused by syphilis (another STI).Peyronie’s diseasePeyronie’s disease is an uncommon condition that causes a thickened area or hard lump (plaque) in the shaft of the penis.

The reasons behind excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis) lie within the physiological make-up of a person. The main trigger is considered to be the over-action of the sympathetic nervous system (the section of our nervous system that governs the fight-or-flight response). Hot weather and an active lifestyle also lead to increased instances of groin sweating, but this is just our bodies natural reaction.

For example, a varicocele can often be surgically corrected or an obstructed vas deferens repaired. Prior vasectomies can be reversed. In cases where no sperm are present in the ejaculate, sperm can often be retrieved directly from the testicles or epididymis using sperm retrieval techniques.Treating infections. Antibiotics can cure an infection of the reproductive tract, but this doesn't always restore fertility.Treatments for sexual intercourse problems. Medication or counseling can help improve fertility in conditions such as erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation.Hormone treatments and medications. Your doctor might recommend hormone replacement or medications in cases where infertility is caused by high or low levels of certain hormones or problems with the way the body uses hormones.Assisted reproductive technology (ART). ART treatments involve obtaining sperm through normal ejaculation, surgical extraction or from donor individuals, depending on your specific case and wishes.

In fact, it’s very normal. As men get older the hue of the semen also changes. If you haven’t had an ejaculation in a long time you could also experience a yellow tint to your semen. It’s a good idea to take a leak before you engage in intercourse. When a man has an erection your urine stream is blocked, so that semen can pass through as the only discharge. However, traces of urine may leak through and cause you to have a more yellow ejaculate. Other reasons for yellow sperm are jaundice and leukocytospermia (high levels of white blood cells).

If this is the reason in your case then no treatment is needed. It will become normal once you start having sex less frequently. Another reason can be the infection of prostate gland.

There are plenty of causes and treatment options for men with low sperm count vary depending on the cause of the condition.

I began to apply a mild antibiotic cream to the torn area and the area around the opening that is red.  It already seems to be getting better.

It started months ago and I saw my pcp and a urologist who told me it should be nothing to worry about. It continues to come and go and I notice it mostly comes back after masturbation. It is rare after sex with my wife. I have also noticed small brown chunks every now and then. What do I do? No doctor seems to think anything is wrong. I had prostate exam and it was fine.","Doctor":"Hi, These symptoms indicate in most cases prostate issues such as prostatitis or hypertrophy and rarely it may be sign of STD infection. You should  avoid intercourse for till symptoms persist and drink plenty of fluids. If symptoms persist it would be good to do prostate ultrasound and check your PSA levels to rule out prostate tumor or hypertrophy and further treatment depends on these findings. In most cases it can be controlled with medications but sometimes, in case of tumor, open surgery is required. And severe benign hypertrophy may be managed endoscopically so you should consult urologist about appropriate options. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

The first of the two started getting sexual around mid-July and the second one started getting sexual around mid-October.

I waited at least 6 weeks after my last physical experience with the last woman to get tested before my new partner and I began our relationship.

I was afraid it was something more, especially after self diagnosing and driving myself crazy, or I figured it was probably a yeast infection (since I m uncircumcised and I wasn t washing myself very well) or blood vessels bursting due to sexual intercourse numerous times out of the day but the FNP said that it looked like a possible yeast infection or maybe even an allergic reaction to my partners Copper IUD?

It happens with minimal sexual stimulation and before the person wishes. Most cases of premature ejaculation do not have a clear cause. With sexual experience and age, men often learn to delay orgasm. Premature ejaculation may occur with a new partner. It may happen only in certain sexual situations or if it has been a long time since the last ejaculation. Psychological factors such as anxiety, guilt, or depression can also cause it. In some cases, it may be related to a medical cause such as hormonal problems, injury, or a side effect of certain medicines. In many cases premature ejaculation gets better on its own over time. Treatment may not be needed. Practicing relaxation techniques or using distraction methods may help you delay ejaculation. For some men, stopping or cutting down on the use of alcohol, tobacco, or illegal drugs may improve how well they can control ejaculation. Hope I have answered your query.

This is usually treated with 10 days of antibiotics, usually ciprofloxacin and there are no permanent consequances. MAsturbation and intercourse should be avoided till pain persist, if possible since I may prolong inflammation course. Some more serious conditions such as tumors or torsion are rare but in doubtful cases you should do Doppler ultrasound or scintigraphy. In this particular case, I don’t think this is required and this should improve on antibiotic therapy. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

The vast majority of testicular lumps and swellings are caused by benign (non-cancerous) conditions that may not need treatment. Some of the main causes are: varicoceles, hydroceles – swellings caused by a build-up of fluid around the testicle, epididymal cysts and inguinal hernias. Some more serious issues such as tumors and carcinomas are less common but should be considered if there is pain and rapid growth of it. In every case, it would be good to do ultrasound of testicles by urologist and this will show us what type of issue this is. If this is benign then there is no need for urgent treatment unless there is pain and inflammation. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

This is usually treated with 10 days of antibiotics, usually ciprofloxacin and there are no permanent consequances. MAsturbation and intercourse should be avoided till pain persist, if possible since I may prolong inflammation course.

I am Dr. Rommstein, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can.Premature ejaculation is uncontrolled ejaculation either before or shortly after sexual penetration. It happens with minimal sexual stimulation and before the person wishes. Most cases of premature ejaculation do not have a clear cause. With sexual experience and age, men often learn to delay orgasm. Premature ejaculation may occur with a new partner. It may happen only in certain sexual situations or if it has been a long time since the last ejaculation. Psychological factors such as anxiety, guilt, or depression can also cause it. In some cases, it may be related to a medical cause such as hormonal problems, injury, or a side effect of certain medicines. In many cases premature ejaculation gets better on its own over time. Treatment may not be needed. Practicing relaxation techniques or using distraction methods may help you delay ejaculation. For some men, stopping or cutting down on the use of alcohol, tobacco, or illegal drugs may improve how well they can control ejaculation.I hope I have answered you query.

In most cases it can be controlled with medications but sometimes, in case of tumor, open surgery is required. And severe benign hypertrophy may be managed endoscopically so you should consult urologist about appropriate options.I hope I have answered you query.

STD is another possible cause and if there was recent intercourse then testing should be done.

At the time, I was 21 and in a serious relationship with my 2nd sexual partner. Things with my first sexual partner had not gone too well. Although everything had worked during foreplay as expected, with no difficultly obtaining or maintaining an erection, when it came time to put on a condom for sex, I quickly lost my erection. It was literally as though I could feel the blood flowing out of my penis and I literally got cold feet, so I'm not sure where all the blood went. The more I worried, the more my erection left me. A similar thing happened with my 2nd partner, especially when trying to have sex more than once. If I was able to maintain the erection, the \\"act\\" was very short lived. My urologist at the time prescribed me Cialis and it worked great. I have used it when having sex with all of my partners since and it relieved my symptoms.However, when I recently started having sex with my new partner, similar symptoms cropped up as before, even though I was still taking Cialis. Similar to before, everything goes well during foreplay, but I either could not retain an erection, or the act was very short lived. I became very worried about what could be going wrong, when I realized that the Cialis I was using had in fact expired last year.Could this be the source of the problem? What is the best way to combat this persistent anxiety? I feel as though I can't even enjoy the sex because I am either worried about losing my erection or premature ejaculation. Appreciate any insights you could share!","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to Healthcaremagic. Thank you for your query. I am Dr. Rommstein, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can.Premature ejaculation is uncontrolled ejaculation either before or shortly after sexual penetration. It happens with minimal sexual stimulation and before the person wishes. Most cases of premature ejaculation do not have a clear cause. With sexual experience and age, men often learn to delay orgasm. Premature ejaculation may occur with a new partner. It may happen only in certain sexual situations or if it has been a long time since the last ejaculation. Psychological factors such as anxiety, guilt, or depression can also cause it. In some cases, it may be related to a medical cause such as hormonal problems, injury, or a side effect of certain medicines. In many cases premature ejaculation gets better on its own over time. Treatment may not be needed. Practicing relaxation techniques or using distraction methods may help you delay ejaculation. For some men, stopping or cutting down on the use of alcohol, tobacco, or illegal drugs may improve how well they can control ejaculation.I hope I have answered you query.

I am concerned that he may faint while driving to/from class.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HealthcareMagic.Feeling dizzy and ill is not a very specific finding, meaning it could be a manifestation of many different conditions, so more info or tests might be necessary. Also it is not clear since when have the issues appeared and whether you have had any tests.One possibility for light-headedness would be anemia, which commonly manifests with dizziness andtiredness.Heart rhythm and function abnormalities would also lead to insufficient blood supply to the brain and other organs so would also justify those symptoms.Another possibility would be metabolic alterations, like diabetes, altered kidney or liver function, electrolyte abnormalities. Hormonal causes like thyroid dysfunction or nutritional ones like vitamin B12 deficiencies must be considered as well.If the symptoms have appeared only very recently it might be a simple transitory viral infection which are generally transitory and need only rest and hydration.So I would start evaluation with some routine cheap tests to screen for anemia, infections and metabolic issues like complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, glucose, liver and kidney function, electrolyte panel, thyroid function, vitamin B12 levels, EKG.I remain at your disposal for other questions."},{"Patient":"Hi - about three weeks ago, I noticed brown staining in my underpants where my penis lies.

I am Dr. Rommstein, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can.Premature ejaculation is uncontrolled ejaculation either before or shortly after sexual penetration. It happens with minimal sexual stimulation and before the person wishes. Most cases of premature ejaculation do not have a clear cause. With sexual experience and age, men often learn to delay orgasm. Premature ejaculation may occur with a new partner. It may happen only in certain sexual situations or if it has been a long time since the last ejaculation. Psychological factors such as anxiety, guilt, or depression can also cause it. In some cases, it may be related to a medical cause such as hormonal problems, injury, or a side effect of certain medicines. In many cases premature ejaculation gets better on its own over time. Treatment may not be needed. Practicing relaxation techniques or using distraction methods may help you delay ejaculation. For some men, stopping or cutting down on the use of alcohol, tobacco, or illegal drugs may improve how well they can control ejaculation.I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time."},{"Patient":"i am 27 years old bachelor. i never had any sexual intercourse till now.i masturbate frequently and i had hurted my epididymis an year ago. it started paining with infection and i have been taking treatment since then. the Surgeon had adviced me nothing was wrong and everything was fine. recently the doctor told me that no more treatment is needed and i do not have to visit him again. he prescribed me to take cataflam tablet whenever i fee pain. the pain is coming on the right side of testicles and the doctor told me one vein is still need to be recovered. having said that,he mentioned that he doesn't know what to do with that and i do not have to visit him again. also he does not advice any operation as everything is fine. i took a second opinion from another doctor and he did some ultra scanning 6 months ago and all the results were normal.I  am worried now as my doctor said as he do not know how to treat this pain. please help me with your suggession as how should i proceed? the pain is not stopping at all and making me stressed despite it is not swelling very high.many thanks..","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to Healthcaremagic.
