These 63 lines cut part of the plane into equilateral triangles of side 2/sqrt{3}.  How many such triangles are formed?","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We are given three sets of lines:   [   y = k, quad y = sqrt{3}x + 2k, quad y = -sqrt{3}x + 2k   ]   where ( k ) ranges from (-10) to (10). These lines form equilateral triangles with side length (frac{2}{sqrt{3}}).2. Finding Intersections:   To form equilateral triangles, we need to find the intersections of these lines. The horizontal lines ( y = k ) intersect with the slanted lines ( y = sqrt{3}x + 2a ) and ( y = -sqrt{3}x + 2b ).3. Intersection Points:   Consider the intersection of ( y = sqrt{3}x + 2a ) and ( y = -sqrt{3}x + 2b ):   [   sqrt{3}x + 2a = -sqrt{3}x + 2b   ]   Solving for ( x ):   [   2sqrt{3}x = 2b - 2a implies x = frac{b - a}{sqrt{3}}   ]   Substituting ( x ) back into one of the equations to find ( y ):   [   y = sqrt{3} left( frac{b - a}{sqrt{3}} right) + 2a = b + a   ]   Thus, the intersection point is ( left( frac{b - a}{sqrt{3}}, a + b right) ).4. Range of ( y ):   The value of ( y ) must be within the range of the horizontal lines ( y = k ), which are from ( k = -10 ) to ( k = 10 ). Since the height of an equilateral triangle with side length (frac{2}{sqrt{3}}) is (1), the possible values of ( y ) for the vertices of the triangles must be between ( -9 ) and ( 11 ).5. Counting the Intersections:   We need to count the number of pairs ((a, b)) such that ( a + b ) falls within the range ([-9, 11]).   - For ( y = 11 ), ( a ) can range from ( 10 ) to ( 1 ), giving ( 10 ) possible pairs.   - For ( y = 10 ), ( a ) can range from ( 10 ) to ( 0 ), giving ( 11 ) possible pairs.   - This pattern continues until ( y = 0 ), where there are ( 21 ) possible pairs.   - Then, the number of pairs decreases symmetrically until ( y = -9 ), where there are ( 12 ) possible pairs.   Summing these, we get:   [   10 + 11 + 12 + ldots + 21 + ldots + 12 = 330   ]6. Triangles Facing Downward:   The same logic applies for triangles facing downward, giving another ( 330 ) triangles.7.

Determining the minimum value of f(x) on the interval [-3,1]:   Since f(x) is increasing before x = -2 and decreasing after, and by evaluating f(x) at the interval's endpoints and the critical point, we find that the minimum value of f(x) within the interval is at x = 1, which is f(1) = -11.Therefore, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 12x on the interval [-3,1] is boxed{-11}, which corresponds to choice boxed{B}."},{"problem":"The condition \\"-1 leq m leq 1\\" is (    ) for \\"the circle (x+m)^2 + y^2 = 1 and the circle (x-2)^2 + y^2 = 4 to have common points.\\"A: Sufficient but not necessaryB: Necessary but not sufficientC: Necessary and sufficientD: Neither sufficient nor necessary","solution":"If the circle (x+m)^2 + y^2 = 1 and the circle (x-2)^2 + y^2 = 4 have common points, then we can consider the distance between the centers of the two circles and the sum of their radii.

If such a point exists, find it; if not, explain why.","solution":"(1) Since |PA_1|, |A_1A_2|, |PA_2| form an arithmetic sequence, we have |PA_1| = a + 4, |A_1A_2| = 2a, and |PA_2| = |a - 4|. By definition of an arithmetic sequence, 4a = a + 4 + |a - 4|. Solving this equation yields a = 2 or a = 0 (the latter is discarded as non-physical). Combining this with the given point (1, frac {sqrt {3}}{2}) on the ellipse, we have frac {1}{a^{2}} + frac {3}{4b^{2}} = 1. Using a^2 = b^2 + c^2 to relate the semi-major axis a, the semi-minor axis b, and the distance c between the foci, and solving the resulting system of equations yields b = 1 and c = sqrt {3}. Thus, the standard equation of the ellipse is boxed{frac {x^{2}}{4} + y^{2} = 1}.(2) Suppose such a point exists inside the ellipse. Let M have coordinates (x_1, y_1) and N have coordinates (x_2, y_2).When the slope of the line exists and is not zero, let the line have the equation y = kx + m. By solving left{begin{array}{lr} x^{2} + 4y^{2} = 4  y = kx + m end{array}right., we obtain the quadratic equation (4k^2 + 1)x^2 + 8kmx + 4m^2 - 4 = 0. Since this equation must have two roots (as it passes through two points M and N on the ellipse), we have x_1 + x_2 = -frac{8km}{4k^2 + 1} and x_1 cdot x_2 = frac{4m^2 - 4}{4k^2 + 1}. Therefore, overrightarrow {PM} cdot overrightarrow {PN} = 12 = (x_1 - 4)(x_2 - 4) + y_1y_2 = (1 + k^2)x_1x_2 + (km - 4)(x_1 + x_2) + 16 + m^2. After substituting the values for x_1 + x_2 and x_1x_2 from earlier and simplifying, we obtain 5m^2 + 32km + 12k^2 = 0. Since k neq 0, we find solutions for m to be m = -frac{2}{5}k or m = -6k. Hence, the equation of the line is y = kx - frac{2}{5}k or y = kx - 6k, which means the lines always pass through the points (frac{2}{5}, 0) or (6, 0). Since only the point (frac{2}{5}, 0) is inside the ellipse, it is the required fixed point. When the slope of the line is zero, a line passing through the point (frac{2}{5}, 0) intersects the ellipse at points M and N such that overrightarrow {PM} cdot overrightarrow {PN} = (-6) times (-2) = 12, which satisfies the condition. When the line is vertical (slope is undefined), the points of intersection are (frac{2}{5}, frac{2sqrt{6}}{5}) and (frac{2}{5}, -frac{2sqrt{6}}{5}), which also satisfy overrightarrow {PM} cdot overrightarrow {PN} = (frac{2}{5} - 4)^2 - (frac{2sqrt{6}}{5})^2 = 12. Summing up, there exists a point boxed{(frac{2}{5}, 0)} inside the ellipse that satisfies the problem condition."},{"problem":"1.

If C is colored 2, then D can be colored 3, 4, or 5, which gives 3 ways; if C is colored 4, then D can be colored 3 or 5, which gives 2 ways; if C is colored 5, then D can be colored 3 or 4, which also gives 2 ways. Therefore, when S, A, B are already colored, C and D have 7 ways to be colored. Thus, the total number of coloring methods is 60 times 7 = 420.Solution 2: The coloring that satisfies the problem's conditions must use at least three colors.(1) If exactly three colors are used, we can first choose one color from the five to color vertex S, then choose two colors from the remaining four to color points A, B, C, D. At this point, A and C, B and D must be the same color, so there are C_{5}^{1} cdot C_{4}^{2} cdot C_{2}^{1} = 60 ways.(2) If exactly four colors are used, we can first choose one color from the five to color vertex S, then choose two colors from the remaining four to color A and B. Since the colors of A and B can be swapped, there are P_{4}^{2} ways to color them; then choose one color from the remaining two to color D or C, and the other one of D and C will be colored the same as its opposite vertex, so there are C_{5}^{1} cdot P_{4}^{2} cdot C_{2}^{1} cdot C_{2}^{1} = 240 ways.(3) If exactly five colors are used, it is easy to know that there are P_{5}^{5} = 120 ways.In summary, the total number of coloring methods that satisfy the problem's conditions is 60 + 240 + 120 = 420.The number of boys in each group is x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{8}, clearly x_{1} + x_{2} + cdots + x_{8} = 25.

This indeterminate equation has C_{9+8-1}^{9} = C_{16}^{9} non-negative integer solutions, meaning there are C_{16}^{9} ways to distribute 25 boys into 8 groups. The number of circular arrangements of 8 groups is P_{7}^{7}, and the number of arrangements of 25 boys is P_{25}^{25}. Therefore, the total number of arrangement methods is C_{16}^{9} cdot P_{7}^{7} cdot P_{25}^{25} = frac{25!16!}{9!}."},{"problem":"Exercise 6. Find all triplets ( a, b, c ) of strictly positive integers such that3^{a}-5^{b}=c^{2}","solution":"Solution to Exercise 6: Since 3^{a} and 5^{b} are both odd, c must be even, so c^{2} equiv 0[4].

We write a=2a', and the equation becomes5^{b}=3^{2a'}-c^{2}=left(3^{a'}-cright)left(3^{a'}+cright)Note that the sum of the two factors is 2 times 3^{a'}, so it is not divisible by 5, meaning one of the two factors is not divisible by 5 and must be 1.

A natural way to separate the case a'=1 from the rest is to look modulo 9. Indeed, in this case, as soon as a' geq 2, both sides must be divisible by 9, i.e., 5^{b} equiv -1[9]. This implies that b must be divisible by 3. Moreover, looking modulo 3, we get that b must be odd. The equation then becomes2 times 3^{a'}=5^{3b'}+1=125^{b'}+1with b' odd. However, the right-hand side then factors by 125+1=126=2 times 7 times 9. In particular, it is divisible by 7, which is not the case for the left-hand side.

The third row after the first transformation stage was obtained by multiplying the first row by -4 and adding it to the third row.On the second stage, we added to the elements of the third row the elements of the second row, multiplied by -1. In the resulting table, the third row represents a shortened record of the third equation of the considered system, which, after the transformations we performed, has the form: -2 v=4, from which we get v=-2.

If fleft(3right)=3, then fleft(7right)+fleft(4right)=____.","solution":"To solve this problem, we will follow the given solution closely, breaking it down into step-by-step reasoning:1. Understanding the Even Property of f(x+2):Given that f(x+2) is an even function, this implies that for any x, f(x+2) = f(-(x+2)). Simplifying this gives us f(x+2) = f(-x-2). 2. Applying the Odd Function Property to f(x):For an odd function, we know that f(x) = -f(-x). Combining these two properties, we can set f(x+2) = f(4-x) (derived from the even function property) equal to -f(-x) (derived from the odd function property), leading to f(x+2) = -f(-x). This can be rearranged as f(x+4) = -f(x), after adjusting the indices to reflect the shift.3. Calculating f(7):Using the relationship f(x+4) = -f(x), we can substitute x = 3 to find f(7). This gives us f(7) = -f(3). Since it's given that f(3) = 3, we find that f(7) = -3.4. Determining f(4):Since f(x) is an odd function, f(0) = 0 by the definition of odd functions (because -f(0) = f(-0) = f(0), implying f(0) = 0). Using the relationship f(x+4) = -f(x) with x = 0, we find that f(4) = -f(0) = 0.5. Finding f(7) + f(4):Combining our results, we have f(7) = -3 and f(4) = 0. Therefore, f(7) + f(4) = -3 + 0.Thus, the final answer to the question is boxed{-3}.Conclusion: This step-by-step analysis helps in understanding how properties of odd and even functions can be applied to solve problems involving functional equations. The key lies in correctly applying the definitions and properties of odd and even functions to derive the required function values."},{"problem":"Question: A student participates in military training and engages in target shooting, which must be done 10 times.

It is therefore sufficient for us to count all the numbers of the required form which are multiples of both 3 and 8 .The digit sum of 'pqrpqrpqr' is 3(p+q+r), which is always a multiple of 3 , so all numbers of the form 'pqrpqrpqr' are divisible by 3 (by the divisibility test for 3 ).So now all we need to do is to count all the numbers of the required form which are multiples of 8 , since they will also be a multiple of 3 and hence a multiple of 24 .By the divisibility test for 8 , we need the three-digit number 'pqr' to be divisible by 8 , and each three-digit multiple of 8 will give us a nine-digit number divisible by 8 . So all that remains is to count the three-digit multiples of 8 .The smallest of these is 104(=13 times 8) and the largest is 992(=124 times 8), so there are 112 three-digit multiples of 8 and therefore 112 numbers of the form 'pqrpqrpqr' which are multiples of 24 .Solution 2As in Solution 1, we can establish that we need 'pqrpqrpqr' to be a multiple of both 3 and 8 .Notice that 'pqrpqrpqr' =1001001 times pqr. 1001001 is divisible by 3 so every number of the form is 'pqrpqrpqr' divisible by 3 . Since 1001001 is odd, we need the three-digit number 'pqr' to be divisible by 8 .There are 124 multiples of 8 less than 1000 ; of these 12 are less than 100 , so there are 112 three-digit multiples of 8 and hence 112 numbers with the properties given in the question."},{"problem":"[ Law of Cosines ]One side of a triangle is equal to 6, the second side is equal to 2 sqrt{7}, and the angle opposite to it is 60^{circ}.

How many spheres with a diameter of 38 units can be placed inside, and then the container can be closed?","solution":"We set the cylinder's axis vertically so that the opening is at the top. The diameter of 2R = 82 units is clearly the internal diameter of the container. When 3 spheres fit exactly into the container's neck, such that their centers O_{1}, O_{2}, O_{3} lie in a horizontal plane S_{1}, and they are arranged so that each pair touches each other, the sides of the triangle O_{1} O_{2} O_{3} are equal to the diameter 2r of the spheres. The radius r_{1} of the circumcircle k_{1} of this triangle is frac{2}{3} of the triangle's height r sqrt{3}. The radius R^{*} of the smallest circle concentric with this, which encloses the three mutually touching great circles of the spheres in the plane S_{1}, is r_{1} + r, i.e.,[R^{*} = r left( frac{2}{3} sqrt{3} + 1 right) = frac{r}{sqrt{3}} (2 + sqrt{3}) = r cdot 2.1547]and for r = 19, R^{*} = 40.94 units, which is smaller than the container's radius R = 41. Considering the slight (less than 0.2%) deviation, we will henceforth consider the cylinder's diameter to be 2R^{*}.Clearly, another layer of 3 spheres can be placed above the existing layer, such that the lines connecting the centers of the upper and lower spheres, O_{4} O_{1}, O_{5} O_{2}, O_{6} O_{3}, are vertical, and the plane O_{4} O_{5} O_{6} is 2r units above S_{1}, since each new sphere touches one of the lower ones. However, if we rotate the new layer until the center O_{4} of the middle sphere touches the center O_{2} of the lower middle sphere, the plane S_{2} of the new centers will be deeper, and more spheres can likely fit into the cylinder. In this case, the projection O_{4}^{*} of O_{4} onto S_{1} will lie on the perpendicular bisector of the segment O_{1} O_{2}, since the projections of the segments O_{4} O_{1} = O_{4} O_{2} = 2r are equal, and O_{4}^{*} is r units from the wall of the container, i.e., on the circle k_{1}. Thus, O_{4}^{*} O_{2} = r_{1}, and the height difference between the planes S_{1} and S_{2} is given by the right triangle O_{4} O_{2} O_{4}^{*}:[d = sqrt{(2r)^{2} - r_{1}^{2}} = r sqrt{frac{8}{3}} ( = 1.6330 r = 31.027 text{ units } ).]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_287cb38b4ad375890270g-1.jpg?height=631&width=639&top_left_y=1056&top_left_x=732)By placing the subsequent layers in the same manner, the plane S_{n} of the centers of the 3 spheres in the topmost (the n-th) layer can be at most m - r units high, where m is the (internal) height of the cylinder, otherwise the container cannot be closed. Thus, the number of layers following the first layer is the integer part of the ratio (m - 2r) : d:[n - 1 = left[ frac{m - 2r}{d} right] = left[ frac{187}{31.027} right] = 6]so at least 21 spheres can be placed in the container.Remarks. 1. We do not get a better arrangement if we loosen the first three spheres so that they touch the wall of the cylinder. In this case, the layers will indeed be lower, but (as can be verified by some calculations) only seven layers will fit into the cylinder. Of course, if the cylinder were very tall, this small modification would also be worth considering.2. We could also place the spheres such that between two layers of 3 spheres each, we place one sphere that touches all 6 spheres. However, this would require increasing the distance between the layers so much that ultimately fewer spheres would fit into the cylinder.3. Our problem \\"How many spheres can be placed?\\" was interpreted in our solution as: \\"Place as many of the given spheres as possible in the cylinder.\\" According to this, it would be an acceptable solution if we did not rotate the second layer to fit into the gaps of the first layer and placed only 15 spheres. Of course, according to the requirement to place \\"as many as possible,\\" this solution would be considered of lesser value than the above solution. The fact that we suspect that more than 21 spheres cannot be placed in the cylinder does not significantly increase the value of our solution. A significant addition would be a proof of this, but this would exceed the scope of our paper, and we did not expect it from our contestants.

Formulate the Inequality: We need to show that:   [   8xy le 5(x + y) - 5(x^2 + y^2)   ]5. Rearrange the Inequality: Rearrange the inequality to isolate terms involving (xy):   [   8xy + 5(x^2 + y^2) le 5(x + y)   ]6. Use the Given Condition: Since (x + y le 1), we can substitute (s = x + y) and (p = xy). Note that (s le 1). The inequality becomes:   [   8p + 5(x^2 + y^2) le 5s   ]7.

The value (sin(beta - alpha) = frac{1}{2}) corresponds to (beta - alpha = 30^circ) or (beta - alpha = 150^circ).10. Solving the system of equations (alpha + beta = 60^circ) and (beta - alpha = 30^circ):    [    alpha + beta = 60^circ,    ]    [    beta - alpha = 30^circ.    ]11. Adding these two equations:    [    2beta = 90^circ implies beta = 45^circ.    ]12. Substituting (beta = 45^circ) into (alpha + beta = 60^circ):    [    alpha + 45^circ = 60^circ implies alpha = 15^circ.    ]13.

Substitute ( D = 9 ) into the tens place equation (2):   [   G + 9 + text{carry from units place} = O   ]   Since ( G + 9 ) must be at least 10 to have a carry, ( G ) must be 1:   [   1 + 9 = 10 quad Rightarrow quad text{carry} = 1 quad Rightarrow quad O = 0   ]10.

Claim: The maximum integer ( n ) such that no matter how the guinea pigs align, we can always find a column or a row of ( 110 ) guinea pigs containing at least ( n ) different species is ( 11 ).2. Upper Bound Construction: To show that ( n leq 11 ), we construct an arrangement where every row or column has at most ( 11 ) distinct species. This is possible by tiling the grid using ( 11 times 10 ) rectangles. For each of the ( 110 ) tiles, we place all ( 110 ) guinea pigs of a certain species. Thus, each row and column will contain at most ( 11 ) distinct species.3. Lower Bound Proof: We need to show that it is always possible to find a column or row with at least ( 11 ) distinct species. Assume for contradiction that there exists a grid where every row and column has at most ( 10 ) distinct species.4. Definitions:   - Let ( DR_i ) be the number of distinct species in row ( i ).   - Let ( DC_j ) be the number of distinct species in column ( j ).5. Sum Calculation:   - Consider the sum ( S_1 = sum DR_i + sum DC_j ).   - Since ( DR_i, DC_j leq 10 ), we have ( S_1 leq 2 cdot 110 cdot 10 = 2200 ).6. Double Counting:   - For a species ( s ), let ( DS_s ) be the number of rows or columns containing a guinea pig of species ( s ).   - Let ( S_2 = sum DS_s ).   - Each appearance in a row or column contributes 1 to ( DS_s ) and also to some ( DR_i ) or ( DC_j ) term.   - Therefore, ( sum DR_i + sum DC_j = S_1 = S_2 = sum DS_s ).7. Lower Bound on ( DS_s ):   - Let ( r ) be the number of rows with some guinea pig of species ( s ), and ( c ) be the number of columns.   - Since a guinea pig can only be in one of these rows and columns, there are at most ( rc ) guinea pigs of species ( s ).   - This implies ( rc geq 110 ).   - By the AM-GM inequality, ( frac{DS_s}{2} = frac{r + c}{2} geq sqrt{rc} geq sqrt{110} ).   - Therefore, ( DS_s geq 2sqrt{110} approx 20.97 ).   - Since ( DS_s ) must be an integer, ( DS_s geq 21 ).8. Contradiction:   - Since there are ( 110 ) species, ( S_2 leq 21 cdot 110 = 2310 ).   - Therefore, ( 2310 leq S_2 = S_1 leq 2200 ), which is a contradiction.Thus, the proof is complete.The final answer is ( boxed{ 11 } )."},{"problem":"7.

If these three primes are distinct, their product would divide ((a^2 + 1)(b^2 + 1)(c^2 + 1)). Therefore, we have:   [   (a + bc)(b + ac)(c + ab) leq (a^2 + 1)(b^2 + 1)(c^2 + 1)   ]3.

Simplifying, we get:   [   (abc - 1)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 1) leq 0   ]7. Since (a), (b), and (c) are positive integers, (abc - 1 geq 0) and (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 1 > 0). Therefore, the inequality ((abc - 1)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 1) leq 0) is clearly wrong unless (abc = 1).8. Hence, two of the primes must be the same. Without loss of generality, assume (a + bc = b + ac).

Since (c + 1) divides (4(c^2 + 1)), it must divide 8. Hence, (c = 1) and we get the solution ((1, 1, 1)).11. If (c = 1), then (a + b) and (a + b) are primes. This implies (a = 1) and (b = 1), leading to the same solution ((1, 1, 1)).12. If all three of (a, b, c) are distinct, we get that (ab + 1) and (a + b) are primes (geq 3) dividing ((a^2 + 1)(b^2 + 1)). But if (a < b), then (ab + 1 > a^2 + 1) and hence (ab + 1 mid b^2 + 1). This implies (ab + 1 mid b^2 - ab = b(b - a)), but both factors are positive and smaller than (ab + 1), leading to a contradiction.13.

We will use the Pigeonhole Principle and combinatorial arguments to find the minimal (n).1. Pigeonhole Principle Application:   - There are 25 rows and 8 colors.   - By the Pigeonhole Principle, in any column, there must be at least one color that appears at least (leftlceil frac{25}{8} rightrceil = 4) times. This is because if each color appeared fewer than 4 times, we would have fewer than (25) squares in total, which is a contradiction.2. Choosing Rows:   - For each column, there is at least one color that appears in at least 4 rows. We can choose these 4 rows in (binom{25}{4}) ways.3. Ensuring the Condition:   - We need to ensure that for any selection of 4 columns, there are 4 rows such that the 16 intersections are all the same color.   - If we consider each configuration of rows thrice per color, we can still find a grid that does not satisfy the given condition. However, if we add just one more column, by the Pigeonhole Principle, we can select 4 columns and 4 rows satisfying the problem statement.4. Calculating (n):   - The number of ways to choose 4 rows out of 25 is (binom{25}{4}).   - Each configuration of rows can be used thrice per color, and there are 8 colors.   - Therefore, the minimal (n) is given by:     [     n = binom{25}{4} cdot 3 cdot 8 + 1     ]   - Calculating (binom{25}{4}):     [     binom{25}{4} = frac{25 times 24 times 23 times 22}{4 times 3 times 2 times 1} = 12650     ]   - Thus:     [     n = 12650 cdot 3 cdot 8 + 1 = 303601     ]5.

We aim to show that such a square contains at least (N(2N-1)) whole dominoes.2. Boundary Piercing Argument:   To show that a (2N times 2N) square contains at least (N(2N-1)) whole dominoes, we need to demonstrate that at most (2N) dominoes are pierced by its boundary. 3. Lattice Definition:   For (i = 1, 2, ldots, 2N), let (L_i) denote the lattice of (2N times 2N) squares, with one of the vertices at ((i, i)).4. Domino-Density Definition:   For a set of dominoes (D) and a set of grid-lines (mathcal{L}), define the domino-density (rho_D(mathcal{L})) as the ratio between the number of dominoes in (D) which are pierced by a line in (mathcal{L}) and the total number of dominoes in (D).5. Contradiction Assumption:   Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that the boundary of any (2N times 2N) square of any lattice (L_i) pierces at least (2N+1) dominoes.6. Large Square Consideration:   Consider a large (2Nt times 2Nt) square and let (D) be the set of dominoes that do not lie entirely outside this square. Since (|D| = 2(Nt)^2 + O(t)) and using our assumption, we get:   [   1 = sum_{i=1}^{2N} rho_D(L_i) geq sum_{i=1}^{2N} frac{1/2(t-1)^2(2N+1)}{2(Nt)^2 + O(t)} = frac{N(2N+1)(t-1)^2}{2(Nt)^2 + O(t)}   ]   This inequality leads to a contradiction for large enough (t).7. Conclusion from Contradiction:   Therefore, there exists a (2N times 2N) square whose boundary pierces at most (2N) dominoes.8. Optimality Argument:   To show that one cannot do better than this, consider the brick-tiling of the plane.

Let's choose a=0 and b=-1. In this case, we have:- For the inequality a > b, substituting the values gives 0 > -1, which is true.- For the inequality a^2 > b^2, substituting the values gives 0^2 > (-1)^2, or 0 > 1, which is false.This example shows that \\"a > b\\" is not always sufficient for \\"a^2 > b^2\\", hence statement A is incorrect.Moving to statement B, understanding the proposition p: forall xin R, 2^x > 0 leads us to realize that for any real number x, 2^x is always positive. The negation neg p should state that there exists an x_0 in R such that 2^{x_0} leq 0. However, since 2^x > 0 for all real numbers x, the correct negation should assert that no such x_0 exists, making statement B incorrect.For statement C, the correlation coefficient r measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. The statement should acknowledge that a strong correlation means |r| is close to 1, not just r itself, because strong correlations can be negative, which would bring r close to -1. Therefore, statement C is incorrect because it does not consider negative correlations.Finally, for statement D, we start with the given regression line equation hat{y} = 2x - 0.4 and overline{x} = 2. Removing the points (-3,1) and (3,-1) and adjusting the slope to 3, we need to recalculate the mean values:- The new sample mean of x, overline{x}' = frac{2 times 10}{8} = 2.5.- The new sample mean of y, overline{y}' = frac{3.6 times 10}{8} = 4.5.Using these new mean values, we can deduce the intercept of the new regression line with the slope of 3:hat{y} = 3x + b.To find b, we use the point (overline{x}', overline{y}') = (2.5, 4.5):4.5 = 3(2.5) + b, leading to b = 4.5 - 7.5 = -3.Therefore, the new regression equation is hat{y} = 3x - 3, which confirms that statement D is correct.Hence, the correct answer is boxed{D}."},{"problem":"Three.

Find the greatest positive integer N with the following property: there exist integers x_{1}, ldots, x_{N} such that x_{i}^{2}-x_{i} x_{j} is not divisible by 1111 for any i neq j.","solution":"We prove that the greatest N with the required property is N=1000. First note that x_{i}^{2}-x_{i} x_{j}=x_{i}left(x_{i}-x_{j}right), and that the prime factorisation of 1111 is 11 cdot 101.We first show that we can find 1000 integers x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{1000} such that x_{i}^{2}-x_{i} x_{j} is not divisible by 1111 for any i neq j. Consider the set {1,2, ldots, 1110}. This set contains 10 integers divisible by 101, and it contains 100 integers divisible by 11 . None of the integers in the set are divisible by both 11 and 101. If we delete all of these 10+100 integers from the set, we are left with 1000 integers. Call these x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{1000}. Now we have 11 nmid x_{i} and 101 nmid x_{i} for all i. Suppose there are i neq j with 1111 mid x_{i}left(x_{i}-x_{j}right), then we must have 1111 mid x_{i}-x_{j}, which is a contradiction, since x_{i}, x_{j} in{1,2, ldots, 1110}. So this set satisfies the requirement.We now prove that given 1001 (or more) integers x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{1001} there are i neq j with 1111 mid x_{i}left(x_{i}-x_{j}right). Suppose for a contradiction that for all indices i neq j, we have that x_{i}left(x_{i}-x_{j}right) is not divisible by 1111, and write X=left{x_{1}, ldots, x_{1001}right}. We may (after reducing modulo 1111 if necessary) assume that x_{i} in{0,1, ldots, 1110} for all i. Then we know that x_{i} neq 0 for all i, and x_{i} neq x_{j} for all i neq j. Suppose for some i we have 11 mid x_{i}. (Since x_{i} neq 0, we know that 101 nmid x_{i}.) Then any integer a neq x_{i} with a equiv x_{i} bmod 101 cannot be an element of X, since 1111 mid x_{i}left(x_{i}-aright). In {1,2, ldots, 1110} there are 10 such integers, all of them coprime with 11 cdot 101. If there are exactly k different values of i such that 11 mid x_{i}, there are 10 k different integers from {1,2, ldots, 1110} that cannot be elements of X, all of them coprime with 11 cdot 101. Similarly, if there are exactly m different values of i such that 101 mid x_{i}, then there are 100 mathrm{~m} different integers from {1,2, ldots, 1110} that cannot be elements of X, all of them coprime with 11 cdot 101.

In X we have 1001-k-m integers that are coprime with 11 cdot 101, so exactly k+m-1 of the coprime integers in {1,2, ldots, 1110} are not in X.

Permutations of the Set:   The set ( {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ) has ( 6! ) permutations. This is because there are 6 elements, and the number of ways to arrange 6 elements is ( 6! ).   [   6! = 720   ]3.

Daniel has k sheets of paper lying next to each other on the table, where k is a positive integer. He writes a number from 1 to n on each sheet (no number is allowed, all numbers are allowed too). On the back of each sheet, he writes exactly the remaining numbers from 1 to n. Once Daniel is done, Merlijn may flip some of the sheets to show the back (he can also choose not to flip any or to flip all of them). If he can make all the numbers from 1 to n visible at the same time (where duplicates are allowed), he wins.Determine the smallest k for which Merlijn can always win, regardless of what Daniel does.","solution":"We will show that Merlijn can win if and only if 2^{k}>n. The smallest k for which Merlijn wins is thus the smallest k with 2^{k}>n.Suppose that 2^{k}>n. Merlijn chooses one by one for each sheet whether to flip it or not. For the first sheet, he places the side with the most numbers on top (so at least half of the numbers from 1 to n). For each subsequent sheet, he places the side with as many numbers as possible that he has not yet made visible on earlier sheets. Let b_{j} be the number of numbers that are still not visible on sheets 1 to j after Merlijn has made his choices for these sheets. Then b_{1} leq frac{1}{2} n and b_{j} leq frac{1}{2} b_{j-1} for j geq 2. Thus, b_{j} leq left(frac{1}{2}right)^{j} n and in particular b_{k} leq left(frac{1}{2}right)^{k} n. Since 2^{k}>n, it follows that left(frac{1}{2}right)^{k} n<1, so b_{k}<1. Since b_{k} must be an integer, b_{k}=0. Therefore, after Merlijn's choice for all k sheets, there are no numbers left that are not visible.Now we prove that for 2^{k} leq n Daniël can ensure that Merlijn cannot win. We do this by induction on k. For k=1, we have n geq 2. Daniël writes the number 1 on one side of the sheet and all other numbers (there is at least one) on the other side. Merlijn cannot now turn this sheet in such a way that he can win. This is the base case of the induction. Now let k geq 1 and assume that Daniël can describe k sheets with n geq 2^{k} numbers such that Merlijn cannot win. We now consider k+1 sheets. Describe the first k sheets in such a way with the numbers 1 to 2^{k} that Merlijn cannot win with only these numbers; this is possible according to the induction hypothesis. Then write the same numbers on each sheet again, but increased by 2^{k}, so that these numbers run from 2^{k}+1 to 2^{k+1}. Finally, write all numbers m with 2^{k+1}<m leq n on the back of each sheet. Now each of these k sheets contains the numbers 1 to n. On sheet number k+1, write the numbers 1 to 2^{k} on the front and the numbers 2^{k}+1 to n on the back. Suppose Merlijn leaves the last sheet with the front side up. Then he must at least make the numbers 2^{k}+1 to 2^{k+1} visible on the first k sheets, but this is not possible according to the induction hypothesis. Suppose Merlijn lays the last sheet with the back side up. Then he must make the numbers 1 to 2^{k} visible on the first k sheets, but this is also not possible according to the induction hypothesis.

Let's denote the left focus of the hyperbola as F'. For a point P on the left branch of the hyperbola such that |PA|+|PF|=7, we analyze the situation step by step.1. Distance between P and foci: The property of a hyperbola tells us that the difference in distances from any point on the hyperbola to the foci is constant and equal to 2a. Thus, we have |FP|-|PF'|=2a.2. Applying Triangle Inequality: Considering the triangle inequality for the triangle formed by points P, A, and F', we have |PA|+|PF'| geqslant |{F'}A|. Adding 2a to both sides gives us 2a+|PA|+|PF'| geqslant 2a+|{F'}A|.3. Minimum Value of |PA|+|PF|: Since |PA|+|PF|=2a+|PF'|+|PA|, its minimum value is when |PF'|+|PA|=|{F'}A|, yielding 2a+|{F'}A|=2a+sqrt{a^{2}+c^{2}}.4. Given Condition: The existence of point P such that |PA|+|PF|=7 implies 2a+sqrt{a^{2}+c^{2}}leqslant 7. This leads to sqrt{a^{2}+c^{2}}leqslant 7-2a.5. Squaring and Simplifying: Squaring both sides and simplifying gives c^{2}+a^{2}leqslant 4a^{2}-28a+49.

By definition, the Simpson line of a point on the circumcircle of a triangle is perpendicular to the sides of the triangle at the feet of the perpendiculars from the point to the sides.   - Therefore, PZ perp BC and Z in BC.4.

Calculate the difference ( A(n+1) - A(n) ):   [   A(n+1) - A(n) = (n + 2) - (n + 1) + sum_{1 le j < n+1} s(n+1 - j)   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   A(n+1) - A(n) = 1 + sum_{i=1}^n s(i)   ]4. Calculate the second difference ( A(n+2) - 2A(n+1) + A(n) ):   [   A(n+2) - A(n+1) = 1 + sum_{i=1}^{n+1} s(i)   ]   [   A(n+2) - 2A(n+1) + A(n) = left(1 + sum_{i=1}^{n+1} s(i)right) - 2left(1 + sum_{i=1}^n s(i)right) + left(1 + sum_{i=1}^n s(i)right)   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   A(n+2) - 2A(n+1) + A(n) = s(n+1)   ]5. Determine when ( s(n+1) = 1 ):   - Every number has 1 as an odd divisor. If it has any other odd divisor, ( s ) is greater than 1.   - Therefore, ( s(n+1) = 1 ) if and only if ( n+1 ) is a power of 2.6.

How many pairs can be chosen from them at least, in which the sum of the numbers is non-negative?","solution":"I. solution. None of the 100 real numbers can be negative, because then their sum would also be negative, not 0. If 99 of the 100 real numbers are negative, then the 100th number must definitely be positive, since only then can the sum of the numbers be 0. In this case, among the two-term sums, there are exactly 99 positive ones, specifically those where one of the terms is the positive number.In the following, we will show that by varying the number of negative numbers among the 100 numbers, we cannot get fewer than 99 non-negative two-term sums.If among the 100 numbers there are k non-negative numbers, then from their pairwise sums, frac{k(k-1)}{2} (necessarily non-negative) sums result. If k geq 15left(k in mathbb{N}^{+}right), then this number is at least frac{15 cdot 14}{2}=105>99. Thus, it is sufficient to consider the case k leq 14.Let the non-negative numbers be denoted by n_{1}, n_{2}, ldots, n_{k}, and the negative numbers by m_{1}, m_{2}, ldots, m_{100-k}; since k leq 14, there are fewer non-negative numbers than negative ones. We arrange those two-term sums that consist of one non-negative and one negative number in a k times (100-k) table as follows:begin{array}{cccc}n_{1}+m_{1} & n_{1}+m_{2} & ldots & n_{1}+m_{100-k} n_{2}+m_{2} & n_{2}+m_{3} & ldots & n_{2}+m_{1} vdots & vdots & & n_{k}+m_{k} & n_{k}+m_{k+1} & ldots & n_{k}+m_{k-1}end{array}If we add the two-term sums in the same column, we get the sum of a non-negative and a part of the negative numbers. The sum in each column is positive, since the sum of the 100 numbers is 0, and by omitting 100-2k negative terms, the remaining sum is positive. Thus, there is at least one positive two-term sum in each column, and therefore we have at leastfrac{k(k-1)}{2}+100-k=frac{(k-1.5)^{2}+197.75}{2}non-negative sums. For 0 leq k leq 100, k in mathbb{N}, the expression takes its minimum value when k=1 or k=2, and in both cases, the minimum value is 99.Thus, at least 99 pairs can be chosen from the 100 numbers such that the sum of the numbers in the pair is non-negative.In the following, we provide several proofs that the number of pairs with a non-negative sum is at least 99.II. solution. Let the 100 numbers be denoted by A_{0}, A_{1}, ldots, A_{99}. We can pair them in 99 different ways, each pair being different in each pairing. If we add the sums of the numbers in each pair in a given pairing, we get 0, so there is definitely a pair in this pairing where the sum of the numbers is non-negative. Thus, in each of the 99 pairings, there is such a pair, and since every pair is different, there are at least 99 such pairs.In the following, we provide a construction for 99 different pairings where each pair appears only once.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_547d8747df5c6b43b777g-1.jpg?height=176&width=816&top_left_y=1755&top_left_x=644)The first pairing is shown in the figure, where the numbers in the same column belong to a pair. The next pairing is obtained by shifting each number along the arrows by one position. Each subsequent pairing is obtained in the same way from the previous one. It is clear that A_{0} will have a different pair in each of the 99 pairings left(A_{1}, A_{99}, A_{98}, A_{97}, ldots, A_{4}, A_{3}, text{finally } A_{2}right). This is also true for A_{1}, whose pairs are: left(A_{0}, A_{98}, A_{96}, ldots, A_{4}, A_{2}, A_{99}, A_{97}, A_{95}, ldots, A_{5}, A_{3}right); and it would also be true if a different element started from the A_{1} position. Since the pairings repeat every 99 cycles, it does not matter which pairing we consider first. Thus, any element can start from the A_{1} position. Therefore, every element will have a different pair in each of the 99 pairings.Thus, at least 99 pairs can be chosen such that the sum of the numbers in the pair is non-negative.Remark. Some referred to an article in the 2006/9 issue of KöMaL when constructing the 99 different pairings. (The problem was also published in the same issue.)III. solution. Let a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{100} be the 100 given numbers in a certain order such that a_{1} geq a_{2} geq a_{3} geq ldots geq a_{100}.Consider the following sums: a_{1}+a_{100}, a_{2}+a_{99}, ldots, a_{i}+a_{101-i}, ldots, a_{50}+a_{51}. The sum of these 50 two-term sums is the sum of all the numbers, which is 0. Therefore, among these two-term sums, there is a non-negative one. Let a_{x}+a_{101-x} (x in{1,2, ldots, 50}) be such a sum.[^0]The two-term sums where one term has an index of at most x and the other term has an index of at most 101-x are greater than or equal to a_{x}+a_{101-x}. Thus, these sums are also non-negative. Let's count these pairs. The first term can be chosen in x ways, and the second term in (101-x) ways. We do not need to count the pairs where the same number is chosen twice, and since otherwise we would count them twice, we need to subtract the number of pairs where both terms have an index of at most x. The number of such pairs is thereforex(101-x)-x-frac{x^{2}-x}{2}=xleft(100+frac{1}{2}-frac{3}{2} xright) .The value of this expression is 99 when x=1, and for x geq 2, it is at least 100 because 100+frac{1}{2}-frac{3}{2} x geq 50. Therefore, the number of pairs with a non-negative sum is at least 99.[^0]:    { }^{1} Kiss György: How to organize a round-robin football tournament? KöMaL, 2006/9., 514-525."},{"problem":"2.

For n=1, only coins of 2 and 3 piastres are available. If s geqslant 3, there exists an r in{0,1} such that (s-3 r) is even. Then s can be expressed as 3 r+2 k, meaning it is 1-decomposable.

Compute the greatest integer less than or equal to the area of mathcal{S}.[I]Proposed by [b]FedeX333X[/b][/I]","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   - We have a circle Omega with radius 18.   - We need to find the region mathcal{S} that the centroid of triangle XYZ sweeps through.   - X varies along all possible points lying outside of Omega.   - Y varies along all possible points lying on Omega.   - XZ is tangent to the circle.2. Setting Up the Circle:   - Let the circle Omega be centered at the origin (0,0) with radius 18.   - The equation of the circle is x^2 + y^2 = 18^2 = 324.3. Positioning Points:   - Let Y be a point on the circle Omega. Thus, Y has coordinates (18costheta, 18sintheta) for some angle theta.   - Let Z be a point on the circle Omega. Thus, Z has coordinates (18cosphi, 18sinphi) for some angle phi.   - XZ is tangent to the circle, so X lies on the line tangent to the circle at Z.4. Finding the Tangent Line:   - The tangent line at Z with coordinates (18cosphi, 18sinphi) has the equation:     [     18cosphi cdot x + 18sinphi cdot y = 324     ]     Simplifying, we get:     [     cosphi cdot x + sinphi cdot y = 18     ]5. Centroid Calculation:   - The centroid G of triangle XYZ has coordinates:     [     G = left( frac{x_X + x_Y + x_Z}{3}, frac{y_X + y_Y + y_Z}{3} right)     ]   - Since X lies on the tangent line, we can parameterize X as (x_X, y_X) such that:     [     cosphi cdot x_X + sinphi cdot y_X = 18     ]   - Y and Z are on the circle, so their coordinates are (18costheta, 18sintheta) and (18cosphi, 18sinphi) respectively.6. Region Swept by the Centroid:   - The centroid G will sweep out a region as X varies along the tangent line and Y varies along the circle.   - The centroid's coordinates are:     [     G = left( frac{x_X + 18costheta + 18cosphi}{3}, frac{y_X + 18sintheta + 18sinphi}{3} right)     ]   - Since X can be any point on the tangent line, the centroid will trace out a region that is symmetric about the origin.7. Area Calculation:   - The region mathcal{S} is the area inside the circle minus a smaller circle of radius 6 (since the centroid's maximum deviation from the origin is 6).   - The area of the larger circle is pi cdot 18^2 = 324pi.   - The area of the smaller circle is pi cdot 6^2 = 36pi.   - The area of mathcal{S} is:     [     324pi - 36pi = 288pi     ]8.

Given the differential equation:   [   frac{d}{dx}F(x) = sin (sin (sin (sin(x)))) cdot cos(sin (sin (x))) cdot cos (sin(x)) cdot cos(x)   ]   We need to find the function ( F(x) ).2. We start by recognizing that the right-hand side of the differential equation can be written as a product of derivatives. Notice that:   [   frac{d}{dx} (sin (sin (sin (x)))) = cos (sin (sin (x))) cdot cos (sin (x)) cdot cos (x)   ]   Therefore, we can rewrite the differential equation as:   [   frac{d}{dx}F(x) = sin (sin (sin (sin(x)))) cdot frac{d}{dx} (sin (sin (sin (x))))   ]3. This suggests that we can use the chain rule to integrate both sides. Let ( u = sin (sin (sin (x))) ). Then:   [   frac{d}{dx} u = cos (sin (sin (x))) cdot cos (sin (x)) cdot cos (x)   ]   Hence, the differential equation becomes:   [   frac{d}{dx}F(x) = sin (u) cdot frac{d}{dx} u   ]4. Integrating both sides with respect to ( x ):   [   int frac{d}{dx}F(x) , dx = int sin (u) cdot frac{d}{dx} u , dx   ]   The right-hand side simplifies to:   [   F(x) = int sin (u) , du   ]5. The integral of ( sin (u) ) is ( -cos (u) ), so:   [   F(x) = -cos (u) + C   ]   Substituting back ( u = sin (sin (sin (x))) ):   [   F(x) = -cos (sin (sin (sin (x)))) + C   ]6. We are given the initial condition ( F(0) = -1 ). Substituting ( x = 0 ):   [   F(0) = -cos (sin (sin (sin (0)))) + C = -cos (sin (sin (0))) + C = -cos (sin (0)) + C = -cos (0) + C = -1 + C   ]   Since ( F(0) = -1 ), we have:   [   -1 + C = -1 implies C = 0   ]7.

Therefore, we have:   [   2017 - b^2 = m^2   ]   This can be rewritten as:   [   2017 = b^2 + m^2   ]   This implies that (b^2 + m^2 = 2017).2.

Use 12 points v_{1}, v_{2}, cdots, v_{12} to represent 12 friends. When two friends sit at the same table for the first time in week i, a line labeled i is drawn between the points representing these two friends, where i=1,2, ldots. Thus, the problem is transformed into determining the minimum number of weeks required to form a complete graph K_{12} in this manner.It is known that the number of edges in K_{12} is C_{12}^{2}=66.In the first week, the number of edges labeled 1 is 3 times C_{4}^{2}=18.In the second week, the 4 people who sat at the same table in the first week are seated at 3 different tables, so at least two of them will sit together, thus at least one edge labeled 2 is missing. With 3 tables, at least 3 edges are missing, so the number of edges labeled 2 is at most 18-3=15.Similarly, when i geqslant 3, the number of edges labeled i is at most 15.Since 18+15+15+15=63<66, the number of weeks required is geqslant 5.Next, we construct a seating arrangement that can achieve the required conditions in 5 weeks.Since 66=18+12+12+12+12, starting from the second week, it is sufficient to generate 4 new edges per table each week.Divide the 12 people into 6 pairs, with the same pair always sitting at the same table, and different pairs sitting together exactly once in 5 weeks. The seating arrangement is as follows:In summary, the minimum number of weeks required is 5.3.

Given that the initial yield was 20000 kilograms from 10 acres, and the final yield is 60000 kilograms, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:[20000(1+2x)(1+x) = 60000]Simplifying this equation, we divide both sides by 20000 to get:[(1+2x)(1+x) = 3]Expanding the left side of the equation gives:[1 + 3x + 2x^2 = 3]Subtracting 3 from both sides to set the equation to 0:[2x^2 + 3x - 2 = 0]Solving this quadratic equation, we find the values of x:[x_{1} = 0.5, quad x_{2} = -2]Since a growth rate cannot be negative, we discard x_{2} = -2.

Apply Theorem 1:   - Theorem 1 states: Let (C, M, N) be three points on a circle (k), and (O) the center of this circle (k). The tangents to the circle (k) at the points (M) and (N) meet at a point (A), and we denote by (B, D) and (H) the orthogonal projections of the point (C) on the lines (AM, AN) and (MN). Then, (CB cdot CD = CH^2).3. Proof of Theorem 1:   - Since (angle CHM = 90^circ) and (angle CBM = 90^circ), the points (H) and (B) lie on the circle with diameter (CM). Thus, (angle CBH = angle CMH).   - Since the line (AN) is the tangent to the circle (k) at the point (N), by the tangent-chordal angle theorem, (angle (CN; AD) = angle CMN). Thus, (angle CBH = angle CMH = angle CMN = angle (CN; AD) = angle CND).   - Since (angle CHN = 90^circ) and (angle CDN = 90^circ), the points (H) and (D) lie on the circle with diameter (CN), so that (angle CND = angle CHD). Thus, (angle CBH = angle CHD). Similarly, (angle CDH = angle CHB).   - From (angle CBH = angle CHD) and (angle CHB = angle CDH), it follows that the triangles (CBH) and (CHD) are directly similar; thus, (CB : CH = CH : CD), so that (CB cdot CD = CH^2).4. Apply Theorem 1 to the problem:   - In the given problem, points (B) and (D) are the orthogonal projections of point (C) on the lines (AM) and (AN) respectively.   - Given (CH = 5) (the distance from (C) to the line segment (MN)), Theorem 1 yields:     [     CB cdot CD = CH^2 = 5^2 = 25     ]   - The area of the rectangle (ABCD) is given by (CB cdot CD), which equals 25.The final answer is (boxed{25})"},{"problem":"9.

Initial Observations:   - If ( a_i = 0 ), then ( i ) divides 0, which is true for all ( i ). However, this would mean ( i ) divides all ( n ) numbers, contradicting the condition that ( i ) divides exactly ( a_i ) numbers.   - Therefore, each ( a_i ) must be positive.3. Range of ( a_i ):   - Since ( a_i ) must be a nonnegative integer and ( i ) divides exactly ( a_i ) numbers, ( a_i ) must be at most ( n ). Hence, ( 1 leq a_i leq n ).4. Sequence Analysis:   - Consider the sequence ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ). For each ( i ), ( i ) must divide exactly ( a_i ) numbers in the sequence.   - This implies that for each ( i ), there must be exactly ( a_i ) multiples of ( i ) in the sequence.5. Special Cases:   - For ( n = 1 ):     - ( a_1 ) must be 1 because 1 divides exactly 1 number (itself). Thus, ( a_1 = 1 ).   - For ( n = 2 ):     - ( a_1 ) must be 2 because 1 divides both numbers in the sequence.     - ( a_2 ) must be 1 because 2 divides exactly one number in the sequence.     - Thus, ( a_1 = 2 ) and ( a_2 = 1 ).6. General Case:   - For ( n geq 3 ):     - Consider the sequence ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ). If ( n geq 7 ), the sequence must include ( n, n-1, n-2, ldots, leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor + 1 ) because each integer in this range only divides itself in the range ([1, n]).     - This leads to a contradiction because consecutive integers are relatively prime, and at least two of them will not be divisible by ( k ) for some ( k ).7.

The players alternate until Blake decides to end the game. At this point, Blake gets a score, given by the number of unit squares in the largest (in terms of area) simple polygon containing only blue unit squares.What is the largest score Blake can guarantee?","solution":"The answer is 4 squares.Algorithm for Blake to obtain at least 4 squares. We simply let Blake start with any cell blue, then always draw adjacent to a previously drawn blue cell until this is no longer possible.Note that for n leq 3, any connected region of n blue cells has more than 2 n liberties (non-blue cells adjacent to a blue cell); up to translation, rotation, and reflection, all the cases are shown in the figure below with liberties being denoted by circles.So as long as n leq 3, it's impossible that Ruby has blocked every liberty, since Ruby has colored exactly 2 n cells red. Therefore, this algorithm could only terminate once n geq 4.Algorithm for Ruby to prevent more than 4 squares. Divide the entire grid into 2 times 2 squares, which we call windows. Any time Blake makes a move in a cell c, let Ruby mark any orthogonal neighbors of c in its window; then place any leftover red cells arbitrarily.Claim - It's impossible for any window to contain two orthogonally adjacent blue cells.Proof. By construction: if there were somehow two adjacent blue cells in the same window, whichever one was played first should have caused red cells to be added.We show this gives the upper bound of 4 squares. Consider a blue cell w, and assume WLOG it is in the southeast corner of a window. Label squares x, y, z as shown below.Note that by construction, the blue polygon cannot leave the square {w, x, y, z}, since whenever one of these four cells is blue, its neighbours outside that square are guaranteed to be red. This implies the bound.Remark (For Tetris fans). Here is a comedic alternative finish after proving the claim. Consider the possible tetrominoes (using the notation of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Tetromino#One-sided_tetrominoes). We claim that only the square (0) is obtainable; as- T, J/L, and I all have three cells in a row, so they can't occur;- S and mathrm{Z} can't occur either; if the bottom row of an mathrm{S} crossed a window boundary, then the top row doesn't for example.Moreover, the only way a blue 0 could be obtained is if each of it cells is in a different window. In that case, no additional blue cells can be added: it's fully surrounded by red.Finally, for any k-omino with k>4, one can find a tetromino as a subset. (Proof: take the orthogonal adjacency graph of the k-omino, choose a spanning tree, and delete leaves from the tree until there are only four vertices left.)Remark (Common wrong approach). Suppose Ruby employs the following algorithm whenever Blake places a square x. If either the north and west neighbors of x are unoccupied, place red squares on both of them. With any leftover red squares, place them at other neighbors of x if possible. Finally, place any other red squares arbitrarily. (Another variant, the one Evan originally came up with, is to place east if possible when west is occupied, place south if possible when north is occupied, and then place any remaining red squares arbitrarily.)As written, this strategy does not work. The reason is that one can end up in the following situation (imagine the blue square in the center is played first; moves for Ruby are drawn as red X's):In order to prevent Blake from winning, Ruby would need to begin playing moves not adjacent to Blake's most recent move.Thus in order for this solution to be made correct, one needs a careful algorithm for how Ruby should play when the north and west neighbors are not available. As far as I am aware, there are some specifications that work (and some that don't), but every working algorithm I have seen seems to involve some amount of casework.It is even more difficult to come up with a solution involving playing on just \\"some\\" two neighbors of recently added blue squares without the \\"prefer north and west\\" idea."},{"problem":"4.

Given twelve red points on a circle. Find the minimum value of n, such that there exist n triangles with red points as vertices, so that every chord with red points as endpoints is a side of one of these triangles.（Supplied by Tao Pingsheng）","solution":"4. Let the set of red points be A=left{A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{12}right}.There are 11 chords passing through point A_{1}, and any triangle containing vertex A_{1} contains exactly two chords passing through point A_{1}. Therefore, these 11 chords passing through point A_{1} must be distributed among at least six triangles containing vertex A_{1}.Similarly, the chords passing through point A_{i} (i=2,3, cdots, 12) must also be distributed among six triangles containing vertex A_{i}. This requires 12 times 6=72 triangles, and since each triangle has three vertices, they are counted three times. Therefore, at least frac{72}{3}=24 triangles are needed.Next, we prove that the lower bound of 24 can be achieved.Without loss of generality, consider a circle with a circumference of 12, and its 12 equally divided points are red points. The number of chords with red endpoints is mathrm{C}_{12}^{2}=66. If a chord subtends an arc of length k, we call the chord's scale k. Thus, there are only six scales for chords with red endpoints, where chords with scales of 1,2, cdots, 5 each have 12 chords, and chords with a scale of 6 have 6 chords.This results in 24 triangles, and they satisfy the conditions of the problem.Therefore, the minimum value of n is 24.If the scales of the chords forming the three sides of a triangle are a, b, c (a leqslant b leqslant c), then either a+b=c or a+b+c=12 must be satisfied.Thus, there are only 12 possible combinations of scales for the sides of red point triangles:begin{array}{l}(a, b, c) =(1,1,2),(2,2,4),(3,3,6),(2,5,5), quad(1,2,3),(1,3,4),(1,4,5),(1,5,6), quad(2,3,5),(2,4,6),(3,4,5),(4,4,4) .end{array}Here is one possible combination:Take six each of the (1,2,3), (1,5,6), and (2,3,5) types, and four of the (4,4,4) type. In this case, exactly 66 chords are obtained, and among them, there are 12 chords each with scales of 1,2, cdots, 5, and 6 chords with a scale of 6.Now, construct as follows: First, make six triangles each of the (1,2,3), (1,5,6), and (2,3,5) types, and three triangles of the (4,4,4) type, then supplement with three triangles of the (2,4,6) type.(1,2,3) type six: Their vertex labels are{2,3,5},{4,5,7},{6,7,9},{8,9,11},{10,11,1},{12,1,3};(1,5,6) type six: Their vertex labels are{1,2,7},{3,4,9},{5,6,11},{7,8,1},{9,10,3},{11,12,5};(2,3,5) type six: Their vertex labels are{2,4,11},{4,6,1},{6,8,3},{8,10,5},{10,12,7},{12,2,9};(4,4,4) type three: Their vertex labels are{1,5,9},{2,6,10},{3,7,11};(2,4,6) type three: Their vertex labels are{4,6,12},{8,10,4},{12,2,8}.(The remaining triangles in each case can be obtained by rotating one of the triangles around the center of the circle as appropriate.)"},{"problem":"A5.

Identifying n from the sum of binomial coefficients:   The sum of binomial coefficients for any expansion (a+b)^{n} is given by 2^{n}. Given that the sum is 64, we set 2^{n}=64. Solving for n, we find n=6. Hence, the binomial expansion is {(x-frac{2}{{x}^{2}})}^{6}.2. Calculating the sum of binomial coefficients for even terms:   The sum of binomial coefficients of all even terms in a binomial expansion is half of the total sum. Since the total sum is 64, the sum of even terms is frac{64}{2} = 32. Therefore, statement A is correct.3. Finding the constant term:   The general term of the expansion is given by {T}_{r+1}={C}_{6}^{r}{x}^{6-r}(-frac{2}{{x}^{2}})^{r}=(-2)^{r}{C}_{6}^{r}{x}^{6-3r}. For a term to be constant, the exponent of x must be 0. Setting 6-3r=0 yields r=2. Thus, the constant term is {T}_{3}=(-2)^{2}{C}_{6}^{2}=4 times 15 = 60. Therefore, statement B is correct.4. Determining the largest binomial coefficient term:   We examine the term when r=3, as the binomial coefficient {C}_{6}^{3} is indeed large, but we find {T}_{4}=(-2)^{3}{C}_{6}^{3}{x}^{6-9}=-8 times 20{x}^{-3}=-160{x}^{-3}. However, this needs correction as the calculation actually results in -180{x}^{-3}, indicating an error in the original solution. Nevertheless, the given statement C is incorrect as per the solution provided.5. Identifying the largest coefficient term:   For each value of r from 0 to 6, we calculate the coefficients.

Let frac{b+c-a}{2}=x, frac{c+a-b}{2}=y, frac{a+b-c}{2}=z.Then x, y, z are integers, and a+b+c=2(x+y+z).

In this case, the favorable outcome is passing through channel A, and the possible outcomes are passing through channels A, B, or C.Thus, the probability is calculated as:[ P(text{Xiao Ming passes through } A) = frac{text{Number of ways to pass through } A}{text{Total number of channels}} = frac{1}{3} ]Therefore, the answer for part (1) is: boxed{frac{1}{3}}.# Part 2:To find the probability that Xiao Ming and Xiao Li pass through the same temperature measurement channel, we can list all possible combinations of the two students passing through the channels.

Among these, there are 3 outcomes where Xiao Ming and Xiao Li pass through the same channel: (A, A), (B, B), and (C, C).Therefore, the probability that Xiao Ming and Xiao Li pass through the same temperature measurement channel is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:[ P(text{Xiao Ming and Xiao Li pass through the same channel}) = frac{text{Number of same channel combinations}}{text{Total number of combinations}} = frac{3}{9} = frac{1}{3} ]Thus, the answer for part (2) is: boxed{frac{1}{3}}."},{"problem":"(5 points) (2015•Zhejiang Mock) If a is a real number, then \\"a^2 neq 4\\" is a(n) ______ condition for \\"a neq 2\\".  　 A.

It is required that when scanning from left to right, the cumulative number of 1s is not less than the cumulative number of 0s. Try to find how many numbers satisfy this condition.","solution":"Below are two solutions.Solution 1: Let p_{2n} be the number of such numbers. The number of ways to fill 2n positions with n 1s is binom{2n}{n}. The remaining n positions are automatically filled with 0s. Subtracting the number of invalid schemes from binom{2n}{n} gives the desired result. An invalid number is one where, when scanned from left to right, the cumulative count of 0s exceeds the cumulative count of 1s.The characteristic of an invalid number is that when scanned from left to right, there must be a certain odd position 2m+1 where the cumulative count of 0s first exceeds the cumulative count of 1s, with m+1 0s and m 1s. In the subsequent 2(n-m)-1 positions, there are n-m 1s and n-m-1 0s. If the 0s and 1s in this part of 2(n-m)-1 positions are swapped, making it consist of n-m 0s and n-m-1 1s, the result is a 2n-bit number composed of n+1 0s and n-1 1s. That is, an invalid number corresponds to a permutation of n+1 0s and n-1 1s.Conversely, any 2n-bit number composed of n+1 0s and n-1 1s, since the number of 0s is two more, and 2n is even, must have a certain odd position where the cumulative count of 0s exceeds the cumulative count of 1s. Similarly, in the subsequent part, swapping 0s and 1s makes it a 2n-bit number composed of n 0s and n 1s. That is, a 2n-bit number composed of n+1 0s and n-1 1s must correspond to an invalid number.The above method establishes a one-to-one correspondence between 2n-bit numbers composed of n+1 0s and n-1 1s, and 2n-bit numbers composed of n 0s and n 1s where the cumulative count of 0s exceeds the cumulative count of 1s when scanned from left to right.For example, 1010dot{0}101 is an 8-bit binary number composed of 4 0s and 4 1s, but when scanned from left to right, at the 5th position (marked with *), the cumulative count of 0s 3 exceeds the cumulative count of 1s 2, corresponding to a 10100010 composed of 3 1s and 5 0s.Conversely, 10100dot{0}010 corresponds to 10100101.Thus, invalid 2n-bit numbers correspond one-to-one with permutations of n+1 0s and n-1 1s, hencebegin{aligned}p_{2n} & =binom{2n}{n}-binom{2n}{n+1}=(2n)!left[frac{1}{n!n!}-frac{1}{(n-1)!(n+1)!}right] & =(2n)!left[frac{n+1}{(n+1)!n!}-frac{n}{(n+1)!n!}right]=frac{(2n)!}{(n+1)!n!} & =frac{1}{n+1}binom{2n}{n}end{aligned}Solution 2: This problem can be one-to-one corresponded to the path from the origin (0,0) to the point (n, n), requiring that the points (a, b) passed through satisfy the relation a leqslant b.The corresponding method is to start from (0,0) and scan the 2n-bit number from left to right. If a 1 is encountered, move one step in the positive y-direction; if a 0 is encountered, move one step in the positive x-direction. Since there are n 0s and n 1s, it corresponds to a path from (0,0) to (n, n). Since the cumulative count of 1s must not be less than the cumulative count of 0s, it can pass through points on the diagonal OA but must not cross the diagonal. Conversely, a path satisfying this condition corresponds to a 2n-bit binary number that meets the requirements.The problem is transformed into finding the number of paths from (0,0) to (n, n) that pass through points on or above the diagonal OA.The discussion of the number of paths from one point to another is covered in Chapter 1. As shown in Figure 2-23, the path from O to A passing through points on or above the diagonal OA corresponds to a path from O' to A' passing through points on or above the diagonal O'A'. This is obvious.The path from O' to A' passing through points on the diagonal OA is the path from O' to A' crossing the diagonal O'A'. Hence, it corresponds to a path from O to A crossing the diagonal OA.Therefore, the number of paths from O to A passing through points on or above the diagonal OA is equal to the number of all paths from O' to A' minus the number of paths from O' to A' passing through points on the diagonal OA.

Calculate the angle theta: Let angle OAF_{2}=theta, where O is the origin. We can use trigonometry to find that sintheta=frac{1}{a}.5. Use trigonometry in triangle ABF_{1}: In this triangle, we can express cos2theta in terms of a, as cos2theta=frac{frac{a}{2}}{frac{3a}{2}}=frac{1}{3}. This leads to the equation frac{1}{3}=1-2sin^2theta=1-2left(frac{1}{a}right)^2.6. Solve for a^2 and b^2: From the equation frac{1}{3}=1-2left(frac{1}{a}right)^2, we find that a^{2}=3. Knowing the distance between the foci is 2c=2, we have c^{2}=1. Since b^{2}=a^{2}-c^{2}, we get b^{2}=2.7. Write the equation of the ellipse: The equation of ellipse C is frac{x^2}{a^2}+frac{y^2}{b^2}=1.

In the first 5 minutes, they travel the same distance. At this point, due to a mechanical issue, B has to reduce its speed to 2/5 of its original speed, and as a result, it arrives 15 minutes after the steadily traveling A. If the malfunction had occurred 4 km further, B would have arrived only 10 minutes after A. How far apart are the two cities?","solution":"2. Task. Two cars, \\"A\\" and B, start from one city to another. In the first 5 minutes, they cover the same distance. Then, due to a motor failure, B has to reduce its speed to 2/5 of its original speed, and thus arrives 15 minutes after the still steadily moving \\"A\\". If the failure had occurred 4 km further, B would have arrived only 10 minutes after \\"A\\". How far apart are the two cities?I. Solution. Let the starting point of the cars be I, the destination C, the point of failure H, and the hypothetical point of failure H^{*}. Let the speed of A be v mathrm{~km} per minute, and the total time required for A to travel from I to C be x minutes. Then, B, after the first 5 minutes, needs (5x-25)/2 minutes to cover the remaining distance, which is 15 minutes more than the time A takes to reach C, so[frac{5 x-25}{2}=x-5+15]From this, the travel time of A is[x=15 text{ minutes}]and the total distance is 15v mathrm{~km}.If B's motor failure occurs 4 km further, then the distance covered until the failure is I H^{*}=5v+4 mathrm{~km}. The remaining distance H^{*} C=15v-(5v+4)=10v-4 mathrm{~km}. A covers this distance in (10v-4)/v minutes, while B covers it in[frac{10 v-4}{2 v / 5}=frac{25 v-10}{v}]minutes. The latter is 10 minutes longer than the former, so[frac{25 v-10}{v}=frac{10 v-4}{v}+10]from which v=1.2 mathrm{~km} / minute.Now, the distance between the two cities is v cdot x=1.2 cdot 15=18 mathrm{~km}.According to this, B's motor failure occurred after I H=1.2 cdot 5=6 mathrm{~km}, and there was still H C=12 mathrm{~km} left to cover. B's new speed became 0.48 mathrm{~km} / minute, and with this speed, the H C segment was covered in 12:0.48=25 minutes. The total travel time was 5+25=30 minutes, which is indeed 15 minutes later than A. - If the failure had occurred only 6+4=10 mathrm{~km} later, then B's total travel time would similarly be[frac{10}{1.2}+frac{8}{0.48}=frac{25}{3}+frac{50}{3}=25 text{ minutes }]and this is indeed only 10 minutes longer than A's time.II. Solution. It is sufficient to talk only about car B. This car would have completed the entire journey 15 minutes earlier if it had maintained its initial speed throughout, instead of reducing its speed to 2/5 of its original speed after 5 minutes, - and 10 minutes earlier if this speed reduction had occurred 4 km further. According to this, it takes 5 minutes longer to cover 4 km at the reduced speed than at the original speed. Thus, the 15-minute delay occurs over a 12 km distance, so after the first 5 minutes of driving, 12 km still needed to be covered.It is easy to calculate the time required for the distance covered after the first 5 minutes. This distance was covered in 5/2 times the time it would have taken at the original speed, so the delay is 3/2 times (one and a half times) the originally required time. At the original speed, this distance would have been covered in 10 minutes.Since we have determined that this distance is 12 km, in the first 5 minutes B covered 6 km; thus, the total distance was 18 km.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_3ad3f3495d7d6f33ee4eg-1.jpg?height=574&width=748&top_left_y=2139&top_left_x=686)Remark. Knowing the above results, we can draw the graph of the movements. The movement of A is represented by the straight line segment O D, the movement of B by the broken line segment O T E, and the hypothetical variant by the broken line segment O T^{*} E^{*}. However, we can also arrive at this diagram independently of the previous results, only the determination of the unit on the distance axis must be postponed, or rather, this will be the task of the problem.The movement of A is represented by a slanted line a starting from O (at any inclination). The point above the 5-minute mark T^{prime} on the time axis is T. By constructing the point U on the segment T^{prime} T such that T^{prime} U: T^{prime} T = 2:5, we get the direction of B's reduced speed in the direction of O U; if B had started with the reduced speed immediately, its movement would have been represented by the line O U. Thus, b is given by the line parallel to O U passing through T.Now imagine a third car A^{prime} moving identically to A but starting later from I and catching up with B exactly at C. Since B is 15 minutes late at C compared to A, this is also true for A^{prime}, so the graph a^{prime} of A^{prime}'s movement starts from the 15-minute mark V on the time axis and is parallel to a. Thus, the point E is determined by the intersection of b and a^{prime}, and the point C on the distance axis is determined by the line parallel to the time axis passing through E. (Of course, D is also on this line.) - Similarly, we get the graph a^{prime prime} of the hypothetical fourth car A^{prime prime} moving identically to A and arriving at C with B if the motor failure had occurred later: this is parallel to a and starts from W, where O W represents the 10-minute delay due to the later failure. Thus, E^{*} is given by the intersection of a^{prime prime} and the line E C, and from E^{*}, we can draw the graph b^{*}=E^{*} T^{*} of the movement B would have completed from the later failure to the destination ( T^{*} is where b^{*} intersects a).Since the distance between the projections H and H^{*} of T and T^{*} on the distance axis is 4 km, constructing one quarter of H H^{*} gives us the unit of the distance axis (1 km). Measuring the segment O C=I C with this unit, we get the desired distance.The diagram also shows the visual equivalents of the calculations in the second solution. triangle D T E sim triangle D T^{*} E^{*}, so D T^{*} : D T = D E^{*} : D E = 10 : 15, thus D T^{*} = 2 D T / 3, T^{*} T = D T / 3; furthermore, triangle I H T sim triangle I H^{*} T^{*} sim triangle I C D, so C H : H^{*} H = D T : T^{*} T, C H = 3 cdot 4 = 12 mathrm{~km}. Additionally, if the projection of T on E C is T^{prime prime}, then T^{prime prime} E = 5 T^{prime prime} D / 2, D E = 3 T^{prime prime} D / 2 = 15 minutes, so T^{prime prime} D = 10 minutes."},{"problem":"3.

The distance from point P to the x-axis is the absolute value of the y-coordinate, which is given as 4. This means |m+2| = 4. Since m+2 is positive in the second quadrant, we can drop the absolute value to get m+2 = 4.Let's solve for m:begin{align*}m + 2 &= 4 m &= 4 - 2 m &= 2.end{align*}Now, substituting m = 2 back into the coordinates of point P:begin{align*}x &= m - 3 = 2 - 3 = -1, y &= m + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4.end{align*}Therefore, the coordinates of point P are (-1, 4).

Since angle A L O=angle M_{1} N O=angle O M M_{1}=90^{circ}, quadrilateral M M_{1} N O is a cyclic quadrilateral; therefore, angle M N M_{1}=angle M O M_{1}. Since angle O K K_{1}-angle O N K_{1}-90^{circ}, quadrilateral O N K K_{1} is also a cyclic quadrilateral. Therefore, angle K O K_{1}=angle K N K_{1}. Since angle M N M_{1}=angle K N K_{1}, it follows that angle M O M_{1}=angle K O K_{1}. Thus, triangle O M M_{1} cong triangle O K K_{1}, so O M_{1}=O K_{1}. Hence, triangle O M_{1} K_{1} is an isosceles triangle. Since angle M_{1} N O=90^{circ}, N is the midpoint of M_{1} K_{1}, and M_{1} K_{1} parallel A C, it follows that Q is the midpoint of A C.(2) As shown in Figure a, consider the case where point P is inside triangle A B C.Let R be the foot of the perpendicular from C to B Q, then triangle A P Q and triangle C R Q are both right triangles and congruent. Therefore, P Q=Q R, A P=C R. Assume B P=P R+C R. Take a point S on line B Q such that C R=R S, then B P-P S, since A P perp B Q, so A B=A S-A C, hence A is the circumcenter of triangle B S C. By the relationship between the central angle and the inscribed angle, we know angle B A C=2 angle B S C=90^{circ}, so triangle A B C is an isosceles right triangle. Thus, frac{A B}{B C}=frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.Figure aFigure b(3) As shown in Figure b, consider the case where point P is outside triangle A B C. Take a point T on line B Q such that Q P=P T.

Understanding Set N:   - The set N is defined by a quadratic inequality x^{2}-2x-8leqslant 0. To find the range of x that satisfies this inequality, we first factor the quadratic expression.   - The quadratic can be factored as (x-4)(x+2)leqslant 0.   - By analyzing the inequality, we find that the solution to x^{2}-2x-8leqslant 0 is -2leqslant xleqslant 4.

This gives us f(x-1) = f(-x+1), which we can rewrite as f(x-1) = -f(x+1).Let's denote t = x - 1, then the previous relationship becomes f(t) = -f(t+2). Applying the periodic property repeatedly, we get:- f(t+4) = f(t), suggesting that the function has a period of 4.Using the periodicity and the properties of an odd function, we compute specific values:- f(3) = f(-1) = -f(1) = -1.- f(2) = -f(0) = 0.- f(4) = f(0) = 0.Therefore, the sum f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + ldots + f(2009) can be computed as follows:Given the periodicity, blocks of four terms will repeat and thus their sum will be zero: (f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + f(4)) = (1 + 0 - 1 + 0) = 0.Since 2009 = 502 times 4 + 1, we have 502 blocks of four terms plus the last term f(2009).The sum will thus be:f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + ldots + f(2009) = 502 cdot (f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + f(4)) + f(2009) = 502 cdot 0 + f(2009)Since the function is odd, and 2009 = 4 times 502 + 1, we have f(2009) = f(1).Finally:f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + ldots + f(2009) = 502 cdot 0 + f(1) = f(1) = 1So the sum is (boxed{1}), which corresponds to option B."},{"problem":"Given the following relations: ①frac{1}{3}∈R; ②sqrt{5}∈Q; ③-3notin Z; ④-sqrt{7}∉N, the correct number of them is ( ).A: 1B: 2C: 3D: 4","solution":"To assess the correctness of the given statements, let's evaluate them one by one based on the definitions of real numbers R, rational numbers Q, integers Z, and natural numbers N.1.

On the other hand, the number of three-element subsets of S containing i is C_{14}^{2}=91. By the given condition (3), each of these subsets is contained in some set A_{j} in A, so15 d_{i} geqslant 91, hence d_{i} geqslant 7.Substituting into (1) gives 7 n geqslant 15 times 7, so n geqslant 15.Next, we construct a family of sets A=left{A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{15}right} that satisfies the conditions of the problem. First, mark the 15 elements of S={1,2, cdots, 15} in a clockwise order on 15 equally spaced points on a circle (as shown in Figure 4-14(a)).

From the diagram of A_{1} (Figure 4-14(b)), we see that there are exactly 3 pairs of elements separated by unit arcs of lengths 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, and each A_{i} has the same property. Therefore, rotating A_{i} clockwise by j-i unit arcs results in exactly 3 elements of A_{i} landing in positions where the elements are in A_{j}, so left|A_{i} cap A_{j}right|=3.If 8 leqslant j-i leqslant 14, then rotating A_{j} clockwise by 15-(j-i) unit arcs results in A_{i}, and similarly, we can conclude that left|A_{i} cap A_{j}right|=3.(3) Let M={u, v, w} be any three-element subset of S. Without loss of generality, assume u, v, w are arranged clockwise on the circle. Consider the number of unit arcs between u and v, v and w, and w and u, and denote the smaller two numbers of these arcs as (a, b) (in clockwise order). Clearly, 1 leqslant a, b leqslant 7, and except for the pair (5,5), all other pairs (a, b) satisfy a+b leqslant 9.Observing the diagram of A_{1} (Figure 4-14(b)), we see that each type of (a, b) three-element set appears exactly once in A_{1}:(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(1,3),(3,1),(1,4),(4,1),(1,5),(5,1),(1,6),(6,1),(1,7),(7,1);(2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(2,4),(4,2),(2,5),(5,2),(2,6),(6,2);(3,3),(3,4),(4,3),(3,5),(5,3),(3,6),(6,3);(4,4),(4,5),(5,4),(5,5).Accordingly, any three-element subset M of S is contained in at least one set in A (for example, the three-element subset {3,8,11} of S corresponds to the ordered pair (5,3), and the three-element subset in A_{1} corresponding to the ordered pair (5,3) is {11, 1, 4}.

This shows that although the problem seems simple, a slight oversight can lead to errors in solving it.This article introduces an effective method for solving such counting problems—the labeling method. It can effectively avoid the aforementioned mistakes.The basic approach is to label each grid point with a number, and the number labeled at grid point A represents the number of counting objects (such as isosceles right triangles) with A as the special element.For Example 1, since each isosceles right triangle has a unique right-angle vertex, we can consider the number of isosceles right triangles with each grid point as the right-angle vertex.Of course, once the right-angle vertex is determined, the isosceles right triangles can be divided into two major categories:(1) The legs are parallel to the grid lines (called upright);(2) The legs are not parallel to the grid lines (called slanted).For each major category, they can be further classified by different directions. Once the direction is determined, they can be classified by the length of the legs.","solution":"Solution: Through the above classification, mark the number of isosceles right triangles with each grid point as the right-angle vertex (Figure 2).

Subcase 2.1: n+1 = q^3:   - The equation is p^2 + 1 = q^3.   - Checking for parity, p must be even and q must be odd.   - If p = 2, then 2^2 + 1 = 5, which is not a cube.   - Therefore, there are no solutions in this subcase.      Subcase 2.2: n+1 = qr:   - The equation is p^2 + 1 = qr.   - If both q and r are odd, then p = 2, but 2^2 + 1 = 5 is prime.   - If 2 mid qr, assume r = 2. Then p^2 + 1 = 2q Rightarrow p^2 = 2q - 1.   - Solving for small primes, we find:     - p = 3 Rightarrow 3^2 = 9 Rightarrow 2q - 1 = 9 Rightarrow q = 5 Rightarrow n = 9.     - p = 5 Rightarrow 5^2 = 25 Rightarrow 2q - 1 = 25 Rightarrow q = 13 Rightarrow n = 25.     - p = 11 Rightarrow 11^2 = 121 Rightarrow 2q - 1 = 121 Rightarrow q = 61 Rightarrow n = 121.     - p = 19 Rightarrow 19^2 = 361 Rightarrow 2q - 1 = 361 Rightarrow q = 181 Rightarrow n = 361.4. Case 3: tau(n) = 4 and tau(n+1) = 3:   - tau(n) = 4 implies n = q^3 or n = qr for primes q and r.   - tau(n+1) = 3 implies n+1 = p^2 for some prime p.      Subcase 3.1: n = q^3:   - The equation is q^3 + 1 = p^2.   - Checking for parity, q must be even and p must be odd.   - If q = 2, then 2^3 + 1 = 9 = 3^2 Rightarrow n = 8.      Subcase 3.2: n = qr:   - The equation is qr + 1 = p^2.   - If 2 mid qr, assume r = 2. Then 2q + 1 = p^2.   - Solving for small primes, we find no valid solutions.5. Case 4: tau(n) = 5 and tau(n+1) = 2:   - tau(n) = 5 implies n = q^4 for some prime q.   - tau(n+1) = 2 implies n+1 = p for some prime p.   - The equation is q^4 + 1 = p.   - If q = 2, then 2^4 + 1 = 17 Rightarrow n = 16.6. Summarize the solutions:   - From the cases, the solutions are n = 8, 16, 9, 25, 121, 361.   - Sum of these values:     [     8 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 121 + 361 = 540     ]The final answer is boxed{540}"},{"problem":"2.

The cost price of each box is 100 yuan, and the selling price is 150 yuan.2. The profit margin must be at least 5% of the cost price.3. The discount rate is denoted by x.The profit margin is calculated based on the cost price. To ensure a profit margin of at least 5%, the selling price after discount should be at least 5% more than the cost price. The cost price is 100 yuan, so 5% of 100 yuan is 5 yuan. Therefore, the minimum selling price to maintain the profit margin is 100 + 5 = 105 yuan.The discount is applied to the original selling price of 150 yuan. Let's denote the discount rate as x, where x is a fraction of the selling price. The price after discount can be represented as 150 - 150 times x. This price should be at least 105 yuan to ensure the profit margin. Therefore, we have:[150 - 150 times x geq 105]To find the maximum discount rate that can be offered, we need to rearrange the inequality to solve for x. However, the standard solution provided directly gives the inequality representing the situation as:[150 times frac{1}{10}x - 100 geq 5% times 100]This seems to be a simplification error in the standard solution. The correct approach to represent the situation based on the initial explanation would be to express the relationship between the selling price after discount, the cost price, and the required profit margin. The correct inequality should ensure that the selling price after applying the discount minus the cost price is greater than or equal to 5% of the cost price.However, following the instructions to stay as close as possible to the given answer without inventing new ideas, and correcting for the apparent mistake in the standard solution, the inequality that correctly represents the situation should be:[150 - 150x geq 105]But since we must adhere to the provided solution, we acknowledge a discrepancy but proceed to select the answer closest to the provided solution's intent:The correct answer, according to the provided solution, is:[boxed{C}]"},{"problem":"5-1.

Identifying the Axis of Symmetry and Vertex:   Since the graph intersects the x-axis at points A(a,c) and B(b,c) and opens downwards (as indicated by the negative coefficient of x^2), the axis of symmetry is x=frac{a+b}{2}. Given the quadratic form, this also implies that x=c is the axis of symmetry. Therefore, we have:   [   c = frac{a+b}{2}   ]2. Condition on c:   Given 0 < a+b < 2, substituting a+b=2c into this inequality yields:   [   0 < 2c < 2   ]   Simplifying, we find:   [   0 < c < 1   ]3. Finding the Maximum and Minimum Values:   - The maximum value m occurs at x=c, because the vertex of the parabola (since it opens downwards) represents the maximum point within the given interval. Thus, substituting x=c into the original equation gives:     [     m = -c^{2}+2c^{2}+c = c^{2}+c     ]      - The minimum value n within the interval -1leqslant xleqslant 1 occurs at the endpoints due to the parabola's shape and given interval. Since the parabola opens downwards and the vertex is within (-1, 1), the minimum value is at one of the endpoints. Evaluating the function at x=-1 gives:     [     n = -(-1)^{2}+2c(-1)+c = -1-2c+c = -c-1     ]4. Establishing the Relationship:   Substituting n = -c-1 into m = c^{2}+c, we aim to express m in terms of n. However, given the expressions for m and n, we directly observe that:   [   m = n^{2} + n   ]   This is because substituting n = -c-1 into m = c^{2}+c directly yields the relationship without further manipulation.Therefore, the correct relationship between the maximum value m and the minimum value n of this function, when -1leqslant xleqslant 1, is m = n^{2} + n.Hence, the answer is boxed{D}."},{"problem":"5.

Initial Consideration:   We need to determine if it is possible to obtain the number (2010) by applying a composition of the functions (sin, cos, tan, cot, arcsin, arccos, arctan, arccos) to the number (1).2. Understanding the Functions:   - (sin(x)) and (cos(x)) are trigonometric functions that map angles to their sine and cosine values, respectively.   - (tan(x)) and (cot(x)) are trigonometric functions that map angles to their tangent and cotangent values, respectively.   - (arcsin(x)), (arccos(x)), and (arctan(x)) are the inverse trigonometric functions that map values back to angles.3. Starting with (arctan(1)):   [   arctan(1) = frac{pi}{4}   ]   This is because the tangent of (frac{pi}{4}) is (1).4.

Generalizing the Pattern:   We observe that:   [   sin(arctan(x)) = frac{x}{sqrt{1+x^2}}   ]   This is derived from the trigonometric identity for (sin(arctan(x))).6.

Applying (cot) to (arctan(frac{1}{2010})):   [   cot(arctan(frac{1}{2010})) = 2010   ]   This is because (cot(arctan(x)) = frac{1}{x}).Thus, by applying the functions in the sequence (cot(arctan(sin(arctan(cdots))))), we can indeed obtain the number (2010).The final answer is ( boxed{ 2010 } )"},{"problem":"8.

If such operations did not occur, we will say that this phase consists of zero operations. Everything starts with the zero phase.During one phase, no number can increase by more than 4. Indeed, if we increased the number itself, then neither to it nor to its neighbors can our operation be applied during this phase, neither before nor after, since a number increased by one in some phase cannot be the minimum during the same phase. Among the neighbors of a number, no more than 4 non-adjacent ones can be chosen, so indeed, we can increase a number by no more than 4 in one phase.Consider the first, fourth, and seventh cells in the first, fourth, and seventh rows of the table, a total of 9 cells. Note that no operation affects two of them. Therefore, to change n phases, at least 9n operations are needed. (Important! We cannot claim that one phase lasts at least 9 operations, as some of our numbers could have been increased in previous phases.)Thus, no more than 10 phases have passed, and in each, no number could have increased by more than 4. Therefore, in 90 operations, no number could have become greater than 40.The example is constructed as follows: consider the second, fourth, and sixth cells in the second, fourth, and sixth rows of the table, a total of 9 cells. We will apply operations only to them. Operations applied to one of these cells do not affect the other 8, and after applying operations to all 9 cells, all numbers in the table increase by at least 1.

However, the results of the test can be obtained only the next day. What minimum number of tests is required to determine the material of each ball if all the tests should be performed today?[i]Proposed by N. Vlasova, S. Berlov[/i]","solution":"1. Initial Setup and Problem Understanding:   - We have 99 identical balls: 50 made of copper and 49 made of zinc.   - We can test pairs of balls to determine if they are made of the same metal.   - The goal is to determine the material of each ball with the minimum number of tests.2. Upper Bound on Number of Tests:   - Consider picking one ball and testing it with each of the other 98 balls.   - This will result in 98 tests.   - After these tests, we will have two sets: one set of balls that are the same as the chosen ball and another set that is different.   - Since we know there are 50 copper balls, the larger set will be the copper balls, and the smaller set will be the zinc balls.   - Therefore, 98 tests are sufficient to determine the material of each ball.3. Lower Bound on Number of Tests:   - We need to show that 97 tests are not sufficient.   - Consider the balls as vertices of a graph, and each test as an edge between two vertices.   - If we perform 97 tests, we will have 97 edges in the graph.   - A graph with 99 vertices and 97 edges is not connected (since a connected graph with 99 vertices must have at least 98 edges).   - Let (C_1, C_2, ldots, C_k) be the connected components of the graph. Since the graph is not connected, (k geq 2).   - Each connected component is a tree (since it is acyclic and connected).   - The number of edges in a tree with (n) vertices is (n-1).   - Therefore, the total number of edges in the graph is (sum_{i=1}^k (|C_i| - 1) = 99 - k).   - Given that we have 97 edges, we have (99 - k = 97), so (k = 2).   - Thus, we have two trees (T_1) and (T_2) with (|T_1| + |T_2| = 99).4. Coloring and Consistency:   - Without loss of generality, assume (|T_2|) is even.   - Label half of the vertices of (T_2) as blue (copper) and the other half as green (zinc).   - Label half (approximately) of the vertices of (T_1) in one color and the other half in a different color.   - Assign Boolean values to the edges based on whether the endpoints are the same color or not.   - We can have either (frac{1}{2}(|T_1| + 1) + frac{1}{2}|T_2| = 50) blue vertices or (frac{1}{2}(|T_1| - 1) + frac{1}{2}|T_2| = 49) blue vertices.   - Given only the Boolean values of the edges, we cannot determine which set of balls is copper and which is zinc.5. Conclusion:   - Since 97 tests are not sufficient to determine the material of each ball, the minimum number of tests required is 98.The final answer is (boxed{98})."},{"problem":"15.

(1) Find the equation of the line passing through P and tangent to circle C.  (2) Let circle C intersect the circle with diameter PC at points A and B. Find |AB|.","solution":" Solution:# Part (1): Finding the Equation of the Tangent LineGiven circle C: x^{2}+y^{2}+2x+4y+1=0, we first find the center and radius of the circle. Completing the square for both x and y terms:- For x^{2}+2x, we add and subtract (2/2)^{2}=1, resulting in (x+1)^{2}-1.- For y^{2}+4y, we add and subtract (4/2)^{2}=4, resulting in (y+2)^{2}-4.So, the equation becomes (x+1)^{2}+(y+2)^{2}-1-4+1=0, which simplifies to (x+1)^{2}+(y+2)^{2}=4. Thus, the center of the circle C is C(-1,-2) and the radius r=sqrt{4}=2.For the tangent line through point P(-3,2), consider two cases:- Case 1: When the slope k does not exist, implying a vertical line. The line x=-3 passes through P and is tangent to the circle since it satisfies the condition of tangency by being perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency.  - Case 2: When the slope k exists, let the equation of the line be y-2=k(x+3). Rearranging, we get y-kx-2-3k=0. The distance d from the center C(-1,-2) to this line is given by the formula d=frac{|-2+k(-1)-2-3k|}{sqrt{1+k^{2}}}. Setting d=2 (the radius), we solve for k:  [  2 = frac{|-2- k -2-3k|}{sqrt{1+k^{2}}} Rightarrow 2sqrt{1+k^{2}} = |-4-4k| Rightarrow 4(1+k^{2}) = 16+32k+16k^{2}  ]  Solving this equation gives k=-frac{3}{4}. Thus, the equation of the tangent line is y-2=-frac{3}{4}(x+3), simplifying to 3x+4y+1=0.Therefore, the equations of the tangent lines are boxed{x=-3 text{ or } 3x+4y+1=0}.# Part (2): Finding the Length of |AB|The equation of the circle with diameter PC is derived from the midpoint formula and distance formula.

The tangent condition to the line x = -1 implies that the radius of the circle is a + 1 because the horizontal distance from the center to the line x = -1 is the radius of the circle.The equation of the moving circle can thus be written as:(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = (a + 1)^2.Expanding this equation yields:x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 = a^2 + 2a + 1.Since the circle passes through a fixed point, this point must satisfy the circle's equation for all values of a and b. We can arrive at the fixed point by examining the fact that b^2 = 4a, and substituting b^2 in the equation of the circle:x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 8ay + 4a = a^2 + 2a + 1.After simplification, we have:x^2 - 2ax + y^2 - 8ay - 2a + 1 = 0.To ensure the equation holds for all a, we must eliminate the variable a from the equation. Notice that if x = 1, then the equation simplifies significantly and becomes independent of a:1^2 - 2a(1) + y^2 - 8ay - 2a + 1 = 0 Longrightarrow y^2 - 2a - 8ay + 1 = 0.Further notice that for y=0, the 8ay term vanishes, and we have:1 - 2a + 1 = 0 Longrightarrow 2a = 2 Longrightarrow a = 1.This provides us with a consistent solution, which suggests that regardless of the value of b (so long as it follows b^2 = 4a), the moving circle will always pass through the point (1, 0).Therefore, the fixed point through which the moving circle must pass is boxed{(1, 0)}."},{"problem":"3.

Then, in the convex pentagon A_{1} P_{1} A_{5} A_{6} A_{7}, there is at least one point in M, denoted as P_{2}, and P_{2} is different from P_{1}. Connect P_{1} P_{2}, then at least 5 of the vertices A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{7} are not on the line P_{1} P_{2}. By the pigeonhole principle, on one side of the line P_{1} P_{2}, there must be 3 vertices, and these 3 vertices, together with points P_{1} and P_{2}, form a convex pentagon that contains at least one point P_{3} in M.Next, draw the lines P_{1} P_{3} and P_{2} P_{3}. Let the region Pi_{3} be the half-plane defined by the line P_{1} P_{2} and on the side opposite to triangle P_{1} P_{2} P_{3} (excluding the line P_{1} P_{2}). Similarly, define regions Pi_{1} and Pi_{2}. Thus, the regions Pi_{1}, Pi_{2}, and Pi_{3} cover all points on the plane except for triangle P_{1} P_{2} P_{3}.

Clearly, this satisfies condition (1). This point set M also satisfies condition (2). The proof is as follows.Assume there exists an integer-point convex pentagon whose interior does not contain any integer points. Since the area of any integer-point polygon can be expressed as frac{n}{2}left(n in mathbf{N}_{+}right), by the principle of the smallest number, there must be a smallest area integer-point convex pentagon A B C D E whose interior does not contain any integer points. Considering the parity of the coordinates of the vertices, there are only 4 cases: (odd, even), (even, odd), (odd, odd), (even, even). Therefore, among the vertices of the pentagon A B C D E, there must be two vertices with the same parity for both coordinates. Thus, the midpoint P of the line segment connecting these two vertices is also an integer point. Since P is not inside the convex pentagon A B C D E, P must lie on one of the sides of the pentagon. Without loss of generality, assume P lies on side A B, then P is the midpoint of A B. Connect P E, then P B C D E is a smaller area integer-point convex pentagon whose interior does not contain any integer points.

The derivative of the curve y=ln(2x+b) gives us the slope of the tangent at any point on the curve. Calculating the derivative, we have:[y' = frac{d}{dx}ln(2x+b) = frac{2}{2x+b}.]Given that the line y=2x-a is tangent to the curve, its slope is 2. Therefore, at the point of tangency, the slopes must be equal:[frac{2}{2x_{0}+b} = 2 Rightarrow 2x_{0}+b = 1.]The equation of the tangent line can also be expressed using the point-slope form, which for a line tangent to a curve at (x_{0}, y_{0}) is:[y - y_{0} = m(x - x_{0}),]where m is the slope of the tangent line. Substituting m = 2 and rearranging, we get:[y = 2x - 2x_{0} + ln(2x_{0}+b).]Comparing this with the given equation of the tangent line, y=2x-a, we find:[a = 2x_{0} - ln(2x_{0}+b).]Substituting 2x_{0}+b=1 into the expression for a, we get:[a = 2x_{0} - ln(1) = 2x_{0},]which implies:[a + b = 1.]Given that a and b are positive real numbers, we aim to find the minimum value of frac{4}{a}+frac{1}{b}.

In every chosen cell we draw one arrow from the angle to opposite angle.  It is known, that for any two arrows, or the end of one of them coincides with the beginning of the other, orthe distance between their ends is at least 2. What is the maximum possible value of n?","solution":"To solve this problem, we need to understand the constraints and how they affect the placement of arrows in the 10 times 10 grid. Let's break down the problem step by step.1. Understanding the Arrow Placement:   Each arrow is drawn from one corner of a cell to the opposite corner. For example, an arrow in cell (i, j) can go from (i, j) to (i+1, j+1) or from (i, j+1) to (i+1, j). 2. Constraints:   - For any two arrows, either the end of one coincides with the beginning of the other, or the distance between their ends is at least 2.   - This means that no two arrows can end within a distance of less than 2 units from each other unless they are directly connected.3. Grid Analysis:   Consider the 10 times 10 grid. Each cell can be represented as (i, j) where 0 leq i, j leq 9. 4. Distance Calculation:   The distance between the ends of two arrows is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula. For two points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2), the distance is:   [   d = sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}   ]   For the distance to be at least 2, we need:   [   sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} geq 2   ]5. Maximizing n:   To maximize the number of arrows n, we need to place arrows such that the distance constraint is satisfied. One effective way to do this is to place arrows in a checkerboard pattern. In a checkerboard pattern, no two arrows will be within a distance of 2 units unless they are directly connected.6. Checkerboard Pattern:   In a 10 times 10 grid, a checkerboard pattern will have 50 cells of one color and 50 cells of the other color. We can place arrows in all cells of one color (say black) without violating the distance constraint.7. Conclusion:   By placing arrows in a checkerboard pattern, we can place arrows in 50 cells without any two arrows violating the distance constraint.The final answer is boxed{50}."},{"problem":"Given the universal set U=mathbb{R}, if set A={xmid frac{x}{x-1} > 0}, then lnot_U A= ______.","solution":"From frac{x}{x-1} > 0, we get x(x-1) > 0.

How many positive integers x, less than 10000, are there for which the difference 2^{x}-x^{2} is not divisible by 7?","solution":"13. 2^{0}=1 gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 7, 2^{1}=2 gives a remainder of 2, 2^{2}=4 gives a remainder of 4, 2^{3} gives a remainder of 1 again, 2^{4} gives a remainder of 2 again, 2^{5} gives a remainder of 4 again, 2^{6} gives a remainder of 1 for the third time, and so on. Thus, when dividing 2^{x} by 7, the remainders can only be the numbers 1, 2, and 4, and these remainders periodically repeat in the following order: 1, 2, 4; 1, 2, 4; 1, 2, 4; ...Now, let's represent x as x=7t+s, where s<7. Then the remainders from dividing x^{2} by 7 are the same as the remainders from dividing s^{2} by 7. If s takes the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, then the remainders from dividing s^{2} by 7 will be the numbers 0, 1, 4, 2, 2, 4, and 1, respectively. Therefore, the remainders from dividing x^{2} by 7 can only be the numbers 0, 1, 4, and 2, and these remainders periodically repeat in the following order: 0, 1, 4, 2, 2, 4, 1. Since the remainders from dividing 2^{x} by 7 periodically repeat every 3 values of x, and the remainders from dividing x^{2} by 7 periodically repeat every 7 values of x, the remainders from dividing 2^{x}-x^{2} by 7 will periodically repeat every 21 values of x.

Therefore, among the numbers 2^{x}-x^{2}, where x=0, 1, 2, ldots, 20, exactly 6 numbers are divisible by 7 without a remainder.Since 10000=21 cdot 476+4, there are 476 complete intervals of 21 numbers among the numbers less than 10000. Therefore, for x not exceeding 9996=21 cdot 476, the number 2^{x}-x^{2} is divisible by 7 exactly 476 cdot 6=2856 times. The remaining three numbers less than 10000 give remainders of 1, 2, and 3 when divided by 21; therefore, one of these numbers (specifically 9998) gives the 2857th value of x for which 2^{x}-x^{2} is divisible by 7 without a remainder. Thus, there are a total of 2856+1=2857 numbers x less than 10000 for which 2^{x}-x^{2} is divisible by 7.

Let in a pyramid one of the following two conditions is satisfied: a) all lateral edges form equal angles with the plane of the base; b) the lengths of all lateral edges are equal. Then the vertex of the pyramid is projected onto the center of the circle circumscribed around the base of the pyramid (this point also serves as the point of intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the base of the pyramid).2. Let in a pyramid one of the following conditions is satisfied: a) all lateral faces form equal angles with the base; b) the lengths of all apothems of the lateral faces are equal. Then the vertex of the pyramid is projected onto the center of the circle inscribed in the base of the pyramid (this point also serves as the point of intersection of the angle bisectors of the base of the pyramid).3.

It is known that through any point inside the circle, no more than two chords with endpoints at the marked points pass. We will call a matching a set of N chords with endpoints at the marked points such that each marked point is the endpoint of exactly one of these chords. We will call a matching even if the number of points where its chords intersect is even, and odd otherwise. Find the difference between the number of even and odd matchings.","solution":"Let the marked points be A_{1}, A_{2}, ldots, A_{2 N} in the order of a clockwise traversal of the circle. We will prove by induction on N that the number of even matchings is one more than the number of odd matchings. For N=1, the statement is obvious: there is only one matching, and it is even.Inductive step. First method. Suppose in the matching, the chord A_{1} A_{i} is involved and it is intersected by exactly k chords. Consider the points A_{2}, ldots, A_{i-1}; exactly k of them are endpoints of chords intersecting A_{1} A_{i}. The remaining i-2-k points are paired by chords that do not intersect A_{1} A_{i}. Thus, the number i-2-k is even, meaning that i and k have the same parity.We divide all matchings into 2 N-1 groups Pi_{2}, ldots, Pi_{2 N}: in group Pi_{i}, the point A_{1} is connected to A_{i}. Remove the chord A_{1} A_{i} from each matching in Pi_{i}; we obtain all possible matchings on the remaining 2 N-2 points. By the inductive hypothesis, among them, there is one more even matching than odd. If i is even, the parity of the matching does not change upon removal, and if i is odd, the parity changes. Therefore, in each of the N sets Pi_{2}, ldots, Pi_{2 N}, there is one more even matching than odd, and in each of the N-1 sets Pi_{3}, ldots, Pi_{2 N-1}, there is one more odd matching than even. In total, the number of even matchings is greater than the number of odd matchings by N-(N-1)=1.Second method. Consider all matchings in which A_{2 N-1} and A_{2 N} are connected by a chord. This chord does not intersect any other. Thus, by removing it from each of the considered matchings, we obtain all matchings on the points A_{1}, ldots, A_{2 N-2}, and the parity of each of them is preserved. By the inductive hypothesis, among our matchings, there is one more even matching than odd.It remains to prove that among the remaining matchings, there are equally many even and odd. Consider any of them; suppose it contains chords A_{2 N-1} A_{i} and A_{2 N} A_{k}. Replace these chords with A_{2 N} A_{i} and A_{2 N-1} A_{k}. If the original chord intersected with some other chord, the new chord will also intersect with it. On the other hand, if the chords A_{2 N-1} A_{i} and A_{2 N} A_{k} did not intersect, the new chords will intersect, and vice versa. Thus, we have divided the remaining matchings into pairs of different parity.## Answer1."},{"problem":"## Task 1Arrange the numbers in ascending order!

Use the property of isosceles trapezoids:   - In an isosceles trapezoid, the diagonals are equal in length and they intersect at a point (P) such that the triangles formed by the diagonals are similar.3. Set up the area relationships:   - Let the area of (triangle APD) be (x) and the area of (triangle BPC) be (y).   - Since (AD = BC), (triangle APD cong triangle BPC), hence (x = y).4. Use the given areas to find the ratio of the segments:   - We know that ([triangle ABP] = 50) and ([triangle CDP] = 72).   - The areas of (triangle APD) and (triangle BPC) are equal, so let (x = y).   - The area of (triangle APD) and (triangle BPC) can be found using the ratio of the segments (AP) and (PC).5.

Let's divide 7101449275362318840579 by 7 using the \\"corner\\" method, as we were taught in school. When dividing 7 by 7, we get 1, the next digit 1 gives 0 in the quotient, then again 1, and so on, until we reach the end. Checking the quotient against the dividend, we see that it indeed results from moving the first 7 of the dividend to the end. The quotient obtained by moving the first digit of the dividend to the end can be found for any divisor and any digit.It is very interesting to investigate the problem in general.Choosing the divisor as 2, we get the number (2-10-52-6-31578-94-) (736-8-4-)The cycle then closes. The dashes indicate where there is no remainder when dividing by 2. Notice that immediately after the dashes come the digits (1,5,6,3,9,7,8,4,2). Therefore, if we need the number to start with 8, we take 842105 and so on, starting from the 8 after the dash. If there is a complete cycle, as in this case, and also for divisors equal to 3, 6, and 11, the number of digits in the desired number is equal to the divisor multiplied by 10 minus 2. If you take 4 as the divisor, you get five separate cycles.

We start with the given equation:   [   frac{a}{b} + frac{b}{a} = n left( frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} right).   ]   Multiplying both sides by (ab) to clear the denominators, we get:   [   a^2 + b^2 = n(a + b).   ]2. This implies that (a + b) divides (a^2 + b^2). We can rewrite (a^2 + b^2) as:   [   a^2 + b^2 = n(a + b).   ]   Therefore, (a + b) must also divide (2ab) because:   [   a^2 + b^2 - n(a + b) = 0 implies a^2 + b^2 - n(a + b) = 2ab.   ]3. Let (a + b = k). Then, we have:   [   a^2 + b^2 = n(a + b) implies a^2 + b^2 = nk.   ]   Also, since (a + b) divides (2ab), we have:   [   k mid 2ab.   ]4. Let (a = xk) and (b = yk) where (x) and (y) are positive integers. Then:   [   xk + yk = k implies x + y = 1.   ]   This is not possible since (x) and (y) are positive integers. Therefore, we need another approach.5. Consider the equation (a^2 + b^2 = n(a + b)). We can rewrite it as:   [   a^2 + b^2 = n(a + b) implies a^2 + b^2 = n(a + b).   ]   This implies:   [   a^2 + b^2 = n(a + b).   ]6. We need to find all pairs of positive integers ((a, b)) such that (a + b mid 2ab). Let:   [   frac{2ab}{a + b} = c.   ]   Then:   [   4ab - 2ac - 2bc = 0 implies (2a - c)(2b - c) = c^2.   ]7. Let (2a - c = kp^2) and (2b - c = kq^2). Then:   [   c = kpq.   ]   So:   [   a = frac{kp^2 + kpq}{2} = kp cdot frac{p + q}{2},   ]   and:   [   b = kq cdot frac{p + q}{2}.   ]8. Since (a neq b), we have (p neq q). Now:   [   n = frac{a^2 + b^2}{a + b} = frac{k^2 left( frac{p + q}{2} right)^2 (p^2 + q^2)}{k frac{(p + q)^2}{2}} = frac{k(p^2 + q^2)}{2}.   ]9. We need (k(p^2 + q^2)) to be even for (n) to be an integer. Since (a + b) is an integer, (k(p + q)^2) is even, which implies that (k(p^2 + q^2)) is also even. Thus, it is enough for (2a = kp(p + q)) and (2b = kq(p + q)) to be even.10. The only other restriction we have is that (p neq q). To satisfy (kp(p + q)) and (kq(p + q)) being even, we take (k) to be an even integer (2l). This makes (a) and (b) both integers, and makes (n = l(p^2 + q^2)).11. If (n) has a prime divisor congruent to (1 pmod{4}), then we can set (p^2 + q^2) to this divisor, and we are good.12. Conversely, if (n)'s only prime divisors are congruent to (2) or (3 pmod{4}), we show that (n) cannot be (frac{k(p^2 + q^2)}{2}). If (k) is even, then letting (k = 2l), we have (n = l(p^2 + q^2)), which we have problems with, since (p neq q) implies that (p^2 + q^2) has a prime divisor congruent to (1 pmod{4}). If (k) is odd, then (p^2 + q^2) is even, so (p equiv q pmod{2}). Then, (n = k left( left( frac{p + q}{2} right)^2 + left( frac{p - q}{2} right)^2 right)), so we run into the same problem as when (k) is even.13.

If the solution set of the inequality f(x) < c is (m, m+6), then the value of the real number c is ________.","solution":"Given that the range of f(x) = x^2 + ax + b is [0, +infty), it means that the vertex of the parabola defined by f(x) lies on the x-axis. Therefore, the minimum value of f(x) is 0.The solution set of the inequality f(x) < c is an open interval (m, m+6). This indicates that f(x) reaches its minimum value within this interval, and the minimum value is 0. Since the interval length is 6, and the parabola is symmetric with respect to its vertex, the vertex is the midpoint of the interval. Thus, the x-coordinate of the vertex is m + 3.The vertex form of a quadratic function is f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex of the parabola. Since the minimum value of f(x) is 0, we have k = 0. Therefore, f(x) = a(x - (m+3))^2.Given that the interval is (m, m+6), and considering the symmetry of the parabola, the points m and m+6 are equidistant from the vertex and have the same function value, which is c. Thus, we can substitute x = m or x = m+6 into the equation to find c.Let's substitute x = m into the equation: c = a(m - (m+3))^2 = a(-3)^2 = 9a.Since f(x) < c for x in the interval (m, m+6) and f(x) = 0 at the vertex, the value of c must be the value of f(x) at either endpoint of the interval. Given that a is a constant and the minimum value of f(x) is 0, the only way for the function to meet these conditions is if c = 9 (considering the function's shape and the given conditions).Therefore, the value of the real number c is boxed{9}."},{"problem":"Which of the following expressions is correct?A: sqrt{64}=±8B: {(-sqrt{2})^2}=4C: sqrt{{{(-5)}^2}}=-5D: sqrt[3]{{-27}}=-3","solution":"To solve this problem, we evaluate each option step by step:Option A: sqrt{64}=8- The square root of 64 is indeed 8, not ±8.

Sum of Areas in Quadrilateral:   [   S_{PAD} + S_{PBC} + S_{PCD} + S_{PAB} = S_{ABCD}   ]   This is because the sum of the areas of the four triangles formed by point ( P ) and the vertices of the quadrilateral is equal to the area of the quadrilateral itself.2.

Let ( L ) be a point on line ( KA ) such that ( LK = AB ), and let ( F ) be a point on line ( KB ) such that ( FK = CD ).4.

Arrange both x and y in increasing order, and finally write down the elements of x followed by those of y.The numbers can be divided into two sets in left(2^{n}right) ways. Among these, the arrangements that do not satisfy the condition are those that are monotonically increasing throughout. This happens either when one of the sets is empty, or when the largest element of x is smaller than the smallest element of y, i.e., when all elements of x are smaller than all elements of y. (There will definitely not be a left-pointing relation within the sets, as we have sorted them.) In this case, the numbers from 1 to k go into x, and the numbers from (k+1) to n go into y, where the smallest value of k is 1 and the largest value is n-1. This represents n-1 possibilities. (This can also be calculated more simply, since writing the numbers from 1 to n in sequence, there are n+1 places in front of and behind them from which to choose 1. If, for example, the one in front is chosen, then x will be an empty set.)Each such arrangement corresponds to a good permutation and vice versa.Thus, the number of good permutations is 2^{n}-2-(n-1)=2^{n}-n-1.b) In this case, divide the numbers into three sets, x, y, and z, and after arranging the elements within the sets, write down the elements of x, y, and finally z in sequence. The three sets can be created in 3^{n} ways.From this, we need to subtract the bad arrangements, i.e., those in which there are 0 or 1 left-pointing relations in the permutation. (If x, y, or z is an empty set, then there are 0 or 1 left-pointing relations.)This can happen if every element in x is smaller than every element in y, or if every element in y is smaller than every element in z. Both cases can be considered as if the numbers were divided into two sets, the A=x cup y and B=z, or the A=x and B=y cup z sets. The elements can be placed into the A and B sets in 2^{n} ways, and the \\"inner\\" set boundary can be drawn in n+1 places. Therefore, we need to subtract 2^{n}(n+1) from 3^{n}. However, we subtracted twice the cases where it is simultaneously true that every element in x is smaller than every element in y, and every element in y is smaller than every element in z. So, the number of these cases must be added back once. In this case, two must be chosen from n+1 places, which is binom{n+1}{2}=frac{(n+1) n}{2} cases.

Vector and Circle Equation:   - We start with the given vectors overrightarrow{b}=(2,0) and overrightarrow{a}=(x,y).   - The condition |overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}|=1 leads to the equation sqrt{(x+2)^2+y^2}=1. Squaring both sides gives (x+2)^2+y^2=1.2. Locus of Point A:   - The equation (x+2)^2+y^2=1 represents a circle centered at (-2,0) with radius 1. This implies that the x-coordinate x of point A lies in the interval [-3,-1].3. Expression for overrightarrow{c}:   - Given lambda +2mu =1, we express overrightarrow{c}=lambda overrightarrow{a}+mu overrightarrow{b}=(lambda x,lambda y)+(2mu,0)=(lambda x+2mu,lambda y)=(lambda x+1-lambda,lambda y).4. Calculating |overrightarrow{c}|^2:   - We find that |overrightarrow{c}|^2=(lambda x+1-lambda)^2+(lambda y)^2.

Minimum Value of |overrightarrow{c}|^2:   - Since -6x-2 > 0 for xin [-3,-1], the quadratic function in lambda opens upwards.   - The minimum value occurs at lambda =frac{x-1}{6x+2}, leading to m^2=frac{1}{2}cdot frac{x^2+4x+3}{3x+1}.6.

Let the initial triplet be ( a ; b ; c). Since all numbers in the triplet are distinct, we will assume that a<b<c. In the next second, the triplet of numbers will look like this: (b+c; a+c ; a+b). The largest number in this triplet is b+c, and the smallest is a+b. Their difference is b+c-(a+b)=c-a, i.e., it coincides with the initial difference between the largest and smallest numbers.

How many cuts are needed in total? (Each cut to form one side of a triangle counts as one cut.)","solution":"When solving this problem, it is evident that considering each triangle individually is not feasible. Therefore, we must think about the triangles as a whole. Since this problem does not require discussing \\"how to cut,\\" but only needs to determine \\"how many triangles are cut out in total,\\" we can focus on the relationship between the number of points ( n ) and the number of triangles. Given that the vertices of the square and each point inside the square can all be vertices of the triangles, we must study the overall characteristics of these points and triangles. For any point inside the square, regardless of how many triangles it forms with other points, the sum of the interior angles formed by the edges extending from this point is always ( 360^circ ). The sum of the interior angles formed by the edges extending from the vertices of the square is always ( 90^circ ). This insight leads us to consider the sum of the interior angles of the triangles and the overall sum of the interior angles of all triangles.Since the sum of the interior angles of each triangle is ( 180^circ ), the sum of the interior angles formed by the edges extending from each point is ( 360^circ ), and the sum of the interior angles formed by the edges extending from the vertices of the square is ( 90^circ ), we can derive the following equation:[n times 360^circ + 4 times 90^circ = 2 n times 180^circ + 2 times 180^circ = (2 n + 2) times 180^circ.]Therefore, ( 2 n + 2 ) triangles can be cut out.With this experience, for the problem of \\"how many cuts,\\" we can think about the number of sides of the triangles as a whole.Since each triangle has 3 sides, the total number of sides of these triangles is ((2 n + 2) times 3 = 6 n + 6). The 4 sides of the square, although they are sides of these triangles, do not need to be cut, so they should be excluded when calculating the number of cuts. Additionally, each side of the triangles inside the square is a common side of two triangles, so one cut produces two sides of two triangles. Therefore, the total number of cuts is[frac{6 n + 6 - 4}{2} = 3 n + 1 text{ (cuts). }]Thus, for ( n ) points inside the square, ( 2 n + 2 ) triangles can be cut out, and a total of ( 3 n + 1 ) cuts are made.From the process of solving this problem, we can see that focusing on the local aspects, such as studying each triangle individually, is difficult and unnecessary. Instead, we can start from the whole, considering the seemingly independent but actually closely related quantities: the total sum of the interior angles of all triangles and the total sum of the sides of all triangles. By gaining an overall understanding of these quantities, we can solve the problem.When solving math problems, we often encounter situations where it is impossible or unnecessary to focus on the individual components of the problem. Instead, we place the problem in a broader context, grasp it as a whole, observe it as a whole, and handle it as a whole. The overall strategy for solving problems generally includes the following aspects:1. By summing or multiplying the whole, we obtain local conclusions.2. By grasping the overall conclusion, we seek a solution path.3. By supplementing the local parts to form a whole, we derive local results from overall thinking.4. By considering the overall nature of the conditions, we control the solution process as a whole.5. By seizing the invariance of the whole, we solve problems from the overall characteristics.The overall strategy for solving problems generally follows the following思路:(Note: The last sentence \\"The overall strategy for solving problems generally follows the following思路:\\" is incomplete in the original text and has been translated as is.
