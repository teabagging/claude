Low hemoglobin is definitely a problem for a small baby like yours but its not a thing to worry so much about. The problem depends on how low the hemoglobin level is. There are so many reasons for the low hemoglobin in a child and the duration required to correct it also depends on the type.

But let me assure you that this is not something which is not treatable. Its in fact completely curable. Pus cells in stools mean there is some infection in the intestines of your baby and that is seen in the stool culture also which grew bacterial organism. The recurrence of the problem probably is due to the infection being incompletely treated prior. So I would also suggest to get your child admitted and testing for typhoid needs to be done . Even if it comes positive, child can be cured with antibiotics. So dont worry and follow your pediatrician s advice. Wishing your child a great health. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello.

Why does the gum hurt her belly so bad?","Doctor":"Welcome to Hcm,Gum is something which is not a food for anyone including your child. This item is not to be swallowed. The reason it causes pain is because it contains substance which is not digested and it doesn't move easily through the gut due to its consistency. I would suggest you to teach your child that gum is suppose to be spit out and not swallowed. Your child is big enough and I am sure smarter enough to understand too.

However, because fever is persistent for so long your child needs to investigated properly before coming down for any conclusion.

I see similar cases in my clinic everyday. During prenatal period sometimes maternal hormones like estrogen pass in baby which causes swelling of breasts on 3 or 4 th day, a white creamy liquid may also ooze from the nipples.

Kindly suggest what would be the reason for her intermittent fever and cough.","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,The fact that child's fever is still not subsiding inspite of augmentin for so long means that the infection is not responding to this medicine. Good thing is that the urine examination and basic blood tests are normal. Such prolonged fever is seen in typhoid , malaria etc. So I would suggest you get evaluation done to rule out typhoid and malaria and if any positive specific treatment for the same would control all problems. However , It would be better you get your child admitted in the hospital for iv antibiotics after sending blood for investigations including blood culture. Hope your child gets well soon.

I am thinking that if the pain is coming from your abdomen and you are having regular bowel movements and urination as well as all sexual functions are normal, you might need to get an ultrasound of your abdomen and pelvis done.

Since, your child has low weight and grind teeth at night there are chances of worms infestation. Also, her appetite is poor. You should give deworming syrup like bandy plus 10 ml at night before sleep. Secondly, start Syrup Bevon 5 ml two times a day for 1 month.

Skin lesions such as these are hard to be commented upon based on description alone and best done by seeing it.

If you have had at risk sexual intercourse within the period, it shall be worth doing a pregnancy. This shall be important in eliminating other differential diagnosis like an ectopic pregnancy. Brown vaginal discharge on its own could be some rare menses, which i common in females of your age, or as you describe, due may be fowl smelling nature might need further investigations. A vaginal swab with direct microscopy, culture and sensitivity tests shall be important in diagnosis given causative agents and possible antibiotics that might eliminate them. Right lower abdominal pain could arise from gynecologic as well as non gynecologic causes. An ectopic pregnancy, ruptured ovarian cyst or appendicitis are commonly found diseases that need to be eliminated in the firs place. Doing an abdominal ultrasound shall be a key tools to put things together. I suggest you book an appointment with the gynecologist for a proper evaluation, clarification and drawing up of an appropriate and adequate management plan. Avoiding unprotected sex during this period, if you are sexually active, could be crucial in preventing sexually transmitted infections, in case found to be transmitted to or from a partner. Couple consultations in such cases might be the ideal situation.

Normally, children who have symptoms of asthma tend to improve as they grow, usually 90 percent children recover by 10 year of age.

Do not put her in lying position after feeding till she burps out the swallowed air.2.

Unusually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds.  3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4.

It is quite common for babies of this age group t pass small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhea and especially antibiotics are not indicated.When the baby takes milk , the stomach expands - then when it is contracting it sets off a wave form which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum, a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out. This is the basis for gastro-colic reflex. Do not worry. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

The cough and runny nose symptoms are subsiding now but I am wondering if there could be any signs of asthma here. I am concerned regarding asthma because he has eczema already.","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in children. For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.For cold you can use Cetrizine at 0.25mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days.For nasal block, plain saline nasal drops will do, every 4-6th hourly to relive nasal congestion.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

I have been recently wondering if this is normal since I ve asked my friends if they have felt the same way but- to my surprise, they didn t. Is it the casual act of a 13- year old to feel disoriented while stretching?","Doctor":"DearWelcome to HCMWe understand your concernsI went through your details. Feeling of disorientation while stretching is not common if the stretching is frequently done as part of an exercise regime. If it is not, if the stretching is done just as stretching of body, the possibilities of disorientation are there, mainly because of the involvement of vestibular balance keepers. You felt disoriented and kind of dizzy while stretching. You should be able to tell how many times? You should also be able to tell, were you stressed, slept, anxious? Anxiety and obsession is another reason for experiencing the same feeling again and again. I suggest you to ignore the disorientation if it is not frequent and there is no other physical symptoms. Ignorance will help you if the problem is due to anxiety and obsession. If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL.  Make sure that you include every minute details possible.

It went away but that night during dinner, he complained of fast heart beat again and had to lie down in the restaurant. I could feel his heartbeat when i put my hand on his chest. We were thinking, maybe he just lacked sleep cause he had been sleeping very late at nite and waking up real early the past few days. Just tonight, after dinner, he complained again of fast heart rate. Since we have a BP and pulse monitor at home, i checked him and got a heart rate of 124 on his left wrist and 195 pulse rate on his right. BP is 96/58 on his left and 105/62 on his right. He used to tell me too that sometimes he would feel that his heart rate would suddenly gets fast. Should we get some more test? Is this normal for a kid his age? Should he stop all forms of exercise and start eating a strict diet? He s 135cm tall and is around 35 kg in weight.","Doctor":"Hi.... I have just read through your query I feel that your kid is having intermittent faster heart rate which is a electrical rhythm abnormality in the heart. This definitely requires further evaluation. A single time ECG and echocardiogram being normal doesn't mean that it is ruled out. If I were your pediatrician I suggest getting a holter ECG monitoring done. The speciality of this test is that it will be put on the patient's body and continuous ECG monitoring can be done for 24 hours. If this happens then whenever kid develops faster heart rate we will be able to diagnose the rhythm abnormality perfectly. I suggest you consult a paediatric cardiologist for this.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my 4 year old son has really weird smelling poos i cant describe them but the first word that comes to mind is metallic smell. he doesnt go regularly and refuses to go sometimes and will go in his pants. when he does go as i say they smell are quite soft sink straight away but seem quite sticky he seems to have a lot left on his bum! on closer inspection they are dark brown in colour with tin black grains in an ideas??","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.

In this case the ECG is normal but the Echo cardiogram has shown some abnormality in the form of increased muscle in the heart. Once such findings are there the case calls for further evaluation.

Sometimes I find them on his neck and today there are two or three on his cheek.","Doctor":"Hi.... by what you quote I think that your kid is having scalp seborrhea. This could be because of a mild fungal infection. But usually skin conditions are best diagnosed after directly seeing them.

The other suggestion is to consult a paediatric Dermatologist regarding this.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Have a 7 month old infant born 4 weeks premature, recently began symptoms of a cold, is on amoxicilin. She is under weight at 13.5 lbs, a few days ago her fontanale became somewhat bulged and firm, and her pulse couldnt be felt there. CT scan at hospital showed nothing specific. She also has reflux and has changed formula. Today her soft spot once aqgain became enlarged and somewhat hard, for well over an hour it stayed that way and you couldnt feel her pulse. Her temp was 100.2 nd she was not lethargic. She has been sleeping much more than usual and doesn t have much appetite. By the time we got to Dr, it was once again nearly normal. Dr is reluctant to do further testing at this time, ie MRI or Spinal Tap. Her stools became very frequent an watery this afternoon also, but probably a result of the antibiotic. Of course now we have to watch for dehydration. We are concerned if we continue to just watch and wait there may be an underlying neurological disorder not yet detected, which could become worse with time. We would like to have a second opinion, however, any attempts to get her in another Pediatric office in the next day or so have been futile. What would you advise? Thank you from a concerned Mom and Grandma","Doctor":"Hi.... if I were your pediatrician I would not waste another minute in doing a spinal tap. I feel that your a kid is having probable meningitis. This can be accurately diagnosed only by spinal tap and analysis of the spinal fluid.

Sometimes a high fever and rash around neck","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with ParacetamoI.Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time.

Do we need to use glasses as per the doctor advice? 2. Is it possible that these powers will decrease and completely go away as the kids grow? 3. What are the precautions we should take? Any particular nutrition? 4. Is their any other form of treatment? Thanks","Doctor":"Hi, I am answering your questions :1. Yes, you need to wear them glasses as per doctor advice, because if they don't wear glasses then there number will increase and secondly, problem of headache can occur. 2. Since, the number is more, chances of them getting completely ok is remote but yes the number can decrease over a period of time if they continously wear glasses. 3. Precautions like watching less tv, and from a distance of atleast 8 feet. You need to give vitamin A rich foods like mango, carrot, cabbage, spinach, sweet potato, tomato, watermelon etc. I hope this has helped you. If you have any more questions, i will be happy to help.

I am being investigated for lots of different things. I have polymyalgia rheumatica and take steroids together with Adcal Alendronic acid and Lansoprazole . I have blood tests regularly as I have an enormous amount of iron in my body. All this started last year - was perfectly OK before this. I have not got haemochromotosis but the haemotologist said that I am collecting iron because I am unwell! I have multiple urinary infections and have had a daily dose of macrobantin for 6 months but the urologist said come off but the infections have restarted! I thought maybe the noises was that there was a living something in me. I heard of somethinglike that years ago and I remember the girl who had the problem said she thought the worm (whatever is was) was talking to her! Maybe it is that that is causing all my other problems?","Doctor":"growling noises in stomach are normal . they are caused by the movement of food and gases along  the intestinal tract called peristaltic movements. these sounds are increased with increased acidity and   increased consumption of fatty food or on taking the medicines causing increased  gastric acid production and gastritis. as you are using steroids and aledronic acid for polymyalgia rheumatica ,both of them are known to cause gastritis and  esophageal reflux. you can safely use cefexime 200mg for urine infection for 10 days, along with probiotic. forget about worms causinf growling.mean while start gradually deceasing the dose of steroids.use pantoprazole 40 mg daily"},{"Patient":"Hi im pps mother with a normal kids,, but when i read alot of pples history of pps mother with nomal kids i found some of da kids get polio from their mother after along time,,, so my question is if my kids r normal now do u think in future they may be get a polio","Doctor":"Hi, welcome to HCM.

I appreciate your efforts for medical consultation in so much distress. Well, its already 4 days since surgery and presence of pain with not passing stools clearly directs the cause towards constipation, and as you were taking codeine as pain killer it also contributes to constipation.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My 5 year old daughter is 5 days post tonsillectomy.

Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in children. For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do.

Typhoid could present with pains and constipation, while muscle tension will present mostly with just pains. Since it is your left side that is dominant, probably you have  muscle tension. Further test could be stool culture and redo MRI and colonoscopy."},{"Patient":"doctor, my son eleven years old has been irritation and itching in ear.he has been using ear buds regulerly to avoid this disturbance.yesterday we noticed that blood coming from his ear.one month back en ent doctor prescribed medicine to put droped into ear and the wax inside the ear will melt and clean it by using a soft bods,so my son put buds in his ear.yesterday we checked his ear but couldn t find any external wounds.pls advice me the cause of irritation and what will be the next step of medication","Doctor":"Hi, this is acute infection in ear, you should immediately take the child to ENT doctor, get the ear examined. In my opinion antibiotics needs to be started in this child for at least 5 days. I hope this has helped you. Wishing your child good health. Take care."},{"Patient":"My ten year old son for the last two weeks has had what appeared to be a red, irritated area behind his ear. It would scab over and was tender to touch. Also it appeared to weeping . We took him to a family clinic yesterday where they gave him antibiotics and said it was a result of an infection in a sinus duct? I can t seem to find any information on this, as I would like to know more. He also suffers from halitosis and I m beginning to wonder if all this is linked somehow.","Doctor":"Hi, there is no such thing as sinus duct infection, probably your doctor wanted to say sinus tract infection. This appears to be a infection of skin around ear region. In my opinion, if you have been given antibiotics, it will get cured in 3 days. I hope this has helped you. Wishing your child good health.

Is this a blocked tear duct or something worse? Also, we just switched from a crib to a pack and play for sleeping arrangements for baby boy, since then , we ve noticed red bumps/ pimples on his head only! He will have them for up to five days, then they go away on there own, almost like bug bites, but don t think they are. Is it possible bumps are allergic reaction to new mattress/pack and play? Thanks - jake","Doctor":"Hi, you don't have to worry. The eye discharge is due to narrowing or blockage of nasolacrimal duct, you need to massage the nasal bone near inner part of eyelids for 1 to 2 minutes 5 times a day and it will gradually improve in 2 months. Secondly, the red rashes appear to be allergic, you have to change cushion cover and it will be fine. I hope this has helped you. Wishing your child good health.

But softer then other stool","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCM It seems that your child has some bleeding vessel most likely a haemorrhoid which lead to the clinical symptoms. Don't worry. It usually occurs due to constipation, malnutrition or inherited tendency. So, try to avoid constipation or hard stools by plenty of oral fluids daily along with fibre rich diet. Also, enrich his daily fit with proteins. You may use stool softener  such as lactulose or liquid paraffin if required.In case, the problem persists then visit a pediatric surgeon for clinical examination and definitive treatment.Hopefully this will help you.

Do you have any idea what this may be and do i need to take him to the doctors?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,When foamy urine is seen in a child, possibility of urinary tract infection should be thought of or rather ruled out. So, if I were your pediatrician, I would get a urine routine done in your son and then decide regarding further management. However, not having fever is an unlikely feature of urinary infection. Hope the suggestion helped.

They are not red, swollen or look infected. It looks as if someone to a nail and hammer to put to holes in her skin. Is this medical or should i be concerned about this little girls safety?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,The problem you mentioned is a very uncommon thing. I appreciate you tried your best to explain the lesion but things like this and especially in area near buttocks, needs to be seen and examined properly before arriving at a diagnosis. So please take your child to a pediatrician at the earliest.

Thank you from a mother just trying to get answers to see where we go from here.","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,I totally understand your concern madam. Chest pain can be due to him being over weight. However every cheat pain has no relation to heart abnormality. And the findings you mentioned especially from an ecg is a very non specific one. However, if I were your pediatrician and I have a doubt like this, I would get an echocardiogram done on your son , to be sure if heart is alright. Hope the advice guides you well.

What could be wrong?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,Its very hard to pin point and say what the problem is with these symptoms your daughter has. But, the fever seems to be significant and it surely warrants thorough investigations in your child. Especially with abdominal pain, an ultrasound abdomen also would be a necessity. However that decision can be taken only after a complete physical examination of the child. So I would suggest you consult a pediatrician at the earliest for a detail evaluation. I wish your child a speedy recovery.

The symptoms you mentioned in your child can be a medical abnormality but considering the age of your child and the description you gave, it could be something other than a seizure. Before even diagnosing what the problem is, she should be taken to a pediatrician and also a neurologist to rule out medical problems which might need a eeg and a Ct scan of brain. At your end, I would suggest you try to talk to her and fins out that something which is scaring her and what exactly your child feels is trying to kill her. A lot of talking in private with your daughter might make things clearer. Happy to clear any further doubts.

Your symptoms can definitely be caused by galbladder disorder. If antiacid drugs didnt help, then the first thing you should think about is gallbladder stones especially if pain becomes more intensive after eating. Coca -cola can trigger pain too. You should do abdominal ultrasound or CT scan to see is there any other intraabdomina ldisoreder. Till that,change you dietary habbits. The best and almost the only treatment for gallbladder disorders is surgical procedure, which is routine procedure today and usually done laparoscopically. You need to stay in hospital for 1-2days after it. If your symptoms persist you should do it definitely.

Good thing is that your child is active and the trauma is not a major one. It could have been lot worse. Although from your description it doesn't seem like the trauma can cause any problems to vision. But, any trauma in and around eye, especially in a small child should be very careful about. If you have any doubt, its better to consult an eye specialist because we need to look inside if any internal trauma has been caused. Wish your child a good health.

From your experience, will the count rise again after full recovery from illness? How long does it take?Thanks in advance for your answer.....from a worried mother","Doctor":"Hi, it's very unfortunate that you are dealing with this problem.

The most probable cause of pain in a child -Tummy tonsils- meaning enlargement of the lymph nodes of the abdomen.-Appendicitis- by default this has to be ruled out in every case of pain in -abdomen of a child.-Worms.The best diagnosis is a high resolution ultrasonography. some blood, urine and stool tests.A therapeutic trial with a course of an antibiotic, metronidazole and probiotics under the guidance of a pediatrician / Surgeon always helps to solve the problem and to get a diagnosis.Also given is a dose of medicines active against worms in intestine.I hope a consultation with a Pediatric Surgeon, investigations and a course of an antibiotic and metronidazole should solve the problem.If this is indicative of appendicitis , please go for the surgery of appendectomy."},{"Patient":"my stomach hurts a lot more frequently, i have had acid reflex since I was a baby.

I frequently use the bathroom and often have wet farts and discharge when I use the restroom. It also seems like I have to pass gas a lot more.","Doctor":"Hello dear... The symptoms as mentioned by you suggest that you might be having Gastro esophageal reflux disease, which is caused by the reflux of acid from stomach to esophagus due to relaxation of the sphincter at the lower part of esophagus. Medical management consist of taking Proton pump inhibitors like Omeprazole, Pantoprazole,etc. (which prevent acid formation in stomach) Metoclopramide can also be used but it has some side effects on long term usage. Surgical treatment includes Fundoplication, in which the upper part of the stomach is wrapped around the lower esophageal sphincter to strengthen the sphincter and prevent acid reflux Also avoid consuming irritating substances such as acidic & rich foods, caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol. Try to sleep on the left side, or with your upper body raised. If symptoms still persist, it will be better to consult a Gastroenterologist. There is no need to worry...you will be fine. Wish you a good health & speedy recovery.

I slept for about 90 minute, and when I awoke, the chills were gone. I don t have any flu or pneumonia symptoms - no breathing issues, no runny nose, no cough or sore throat . Could this be food poisoning , or the 24-hour bug I thought it was?","Doctor":"Hello, lindab-jewels, If you ate out at a public place or a picnic where ther were pre-prepared foods , especially poultry ,egg preparations etc, then you have to think about food poisoning. Contaminated food or drink usually gives you symptoms within hours. Also, more than one person may be affected. You mention that you don't have aches and pains, sore throat,cough etc. This kind of rules out stomach virus . Roto virus, Noro Virus, can cause severe gastroenteritis with vomiting and diarrhea. Your symptoms are not suggestive of that. It could be a mild case of food poisoning and you are already getting better. I suggest that you stay on soft blad foods for 2-3 days. Avoid fatty, fried ,spicy foods. O.K. to take Tums or peptobismol if you have diarrhea. I wish you well."},{"Patient":"My daughter is 5 years old and weights 15.9kg.

According to you your son is excellent in academics and can focus in all activities, can communicate very well and is highly analytical. That is certainly good for a 4 year old child. I don't see anything wrong in the behavior of the child. At the age of 4, any child is supposed to be a bit hyper mainly because of the playful attitude. You may search internet for the signs and symptoms of hyper activity and compare with your child. It's natural to wonder if ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) could be the cause of your child's high energy. But just being hyper doesn't necessarily mean your child has the condition. Watch out for these other signs of ADHD:Does he interrupt frequently?Does he have trouble following instructions and organizing tasks?Is he forgetful?Is he impatient?Does he frequently speak out of turn?If your child has ADHD, these problems will happen over a long period of time, and usually at home as well as school. If you say Yes for three out of these questions, you may need to consult a psychologist for ADHD assessment and further guidelines.If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL.

Is there something serious the blood could be a symptom of that I should worry about or is this the same type of thing where the chicken he was trying to eat dilated a stricture?","Doctor":"Hi... I understand you a concern. At  your son's age group any blood stained vomiting cannot be ignored lightly. All the more so with the background of multiple stricture formation and serial dialatation I suggest that you take your son to the nearest Emergency Room. I am suggesting this because it might or might not be an emergency, but once a doctor examines your kid and feels that he can go home safely it will be reassuring.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my 9 year old daughter had her tonsils out 15 days ago & has had bleeding 3 times over the last 2 days, up to 3/4 of a cup of blood in total.

Usually the natural course of the illness will take 5 to 7 days to completely settle down. Unless the kid is having respiratory distress or breathlessness or inability to feed or very high grade fever or listlessness are very poor oral intake you need not worry. For cough you can give any of the over the counter cough suppressants which are licenced in your country like Promethazine or Dextrometharphone.  Otherwise I suggest you seek medical attention.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my daughter is 18months now.she had a throat infection and fever  last week and the doctor prescribed amoxcillin antibiotic,then nasal spray for blocked nose.she got the throat infection from me.after taking antibiotic for 5days she was normal.then started severe cough at night.then went to doctor and said that she had a mild wheeze and was put nebulizer once and prescribed dilanyl 2.5ml three times  and toplexil  2.5ml 3times for 5days.we have finished 5days medicine ,but still she is coughing at the night.iam so worried.iam in uae.i have ventorlin syrup which my peadiatrician gave me when i went india last month.i have given her this medicine when she had cough and fever last time.but now can i give her this medicine.pls help","Doctor":"Hi...Ventorlin  is a medicine which is given for wheezing. If you feel that your child is having wheeze associated with severe cough and breathlessness you can give ventorlin as medicine till you see your pediatrician. Sometimes ventorlin can cause increased heart rate if given in excess dose. But as your pediatrician has already suggested nebulization, I see that your kid is having wheeze so you can go ahead and give ventolin.But  get back to your doctor as soon as possible.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my daughter is 10 years old and her right kidney removed when she was nine month.

I will suggest you the symptoms of urinary tract infection so that you can be on the Alert and as of now be reassured. The symptoms of urinary tract infection include -  high grade fever with chills and rigors/ pain or burning sensation while passing urine/ increased frequency of urination with passage of small quantities of urine every time/ vomiting/ pain abdomen.

You need not worry about it as it is not a serious condition. It will get better by itself. Meanwhile you need to treat it symptomatically by pain medication. But in children you cannot give the same pain medications which are used for adults. I suggest you use Paracetamol in the appropriate dose every 6 hour early if the pain is there. But if the pain is very severe you can use tramadol at the dose of 1 milligram per kg body weight per dose every 8 hourly.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Ive been experiencing bad stomach pains I have endometriosis I ve been to er many many times but nothing now I have bad pains like I have to go to the bathroom but nothing and always feel like throwing up I ve had 5 stomach surgeries included a hysterectomy gallbladder removed and I also wake up to very bad leg pain I don t know what to do in a lot of pain AAAA","Doctor":"Hi Melive, Thanks for writing your query.

For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.For cold you can use Cetrizine at 0.25mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days.For nasal block, plain saline nasal drops will do, every 4-6th hourly to relive nasal congestion.For severe dry cough you can use syrup Ascoril - D. This is a prescription drug and I suggest you approach your pediatrician for this.Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do. Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridges & soups.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

You have not mentioned if you suffer from the same type of problem after your periods end. Having abdominal cramps, lower back pain, sore breasts, nausea, etc are known as dysmenorrhea and is a normal condition experienced by most women. It may start a day or two before the periods begins and ends up as the period finishes. This time your period did not last for 5-7 days as it normally happens, if you had an unprotected intercourse, get a urine test for pregnancy done. This is for you to stay on the safer side. If you are not pregnant the other reasons can be PID, ovarian cysts, fibroid, endometriosis, etc. You should get clinically examined and get investigations like USG, pap smears, vaginal/cervical cultures, blood tests done. Consult your gynae and get proper hormonal therapies, antibiotics. Depending upon the diagnosis you may have to under surgery for fibroids, etc. NSAIDS can give you temporary relief, take care."},{"Patient":"My two yr old daughter Has had a 101 fever for 9 days and isnt eating or drinking much at all she has 3 sores one on her finger one on her tounge and one on the outside of her mouth.

When i had intercourse 3 days ago we were in the missionary position when that same spot had a sharp shooting pain through it. It now just feels irritated more than anything except for the occasional sharp pain, and I cannot pass anything at the moment. do you have any ideas?","Doctor":"Hello, slloyd, The location of the pain and some changes in your bowel habits point to som problem with your large intestine or the colon. If you are over 40+ years of age I suspect you may have Diverticulosis or pockets on the colon wall. This is more common on the left side of the colon although can involve any part of the bowel. If one of these pockets get infected , then you can have significant pain, fever, chills and even bloody dirrhea. In many cases , this is associated with spasms and the symptoms are similar to IBS or irritable bowel syndrome with abdominal pain and constipation. If you have not had a screening colonoscopy, you should get one. At the minimum, you can get a Barium Enema to see if there are any problems. If you have any family members with history of colon cancer , then you should have the colonoscopy. Same thing is true if there are any signs of blood in the stool, weight loss or anemia. Have your stool tested for blood and also get a complete blood work. For constipation, you can take stool softeners that are readilily available in drug stores. A high fiber diet and adequate fluid intake is very important. There is also a polyethylene glycol solution which is safe to take. Follow the instructions on the label. (MiraLax) There are generic alternatives to this brand. I wish you the very best."},{"Patient":"sorry for bothering you.

It is quite common for babies of this age group t pass small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhea and especially antibiotics are not indicated.When the baby takes milk , the stomach expands - then when it is contracting it sets off a wave form which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum, a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out. This is the basis for gastro-colic reflex. Do not worry.

I understand your concern.Hyperactivity is a disorder of the mental makeup of the kid and not a physical deformity of the brain. Some kids may respond to iron simply and some kids my need other medications like Atomoxetine. But whatever it is the kids needs a thorough psychological evaluation and may be after behavioural therapy it might get better. But usually hyperactivity kids have very good IQ and if their energy can be diverted to a vocational training or any art or sport they like they will do wonders.

The most likely reason for such complaints are recurrent viral infections which are usually self limiting and improve gradually over time. The frequency increases after tuberculosis due to low immunity.Allergic coughs are not usually associated with fever spikes. Use of inhaler therapy is purely guided by lung functions and clinical examination.So, I would recommend you the following measures to help him out:1. Maintain a proper record of signs and symptoms and response to treatment.2. You may check him for immunity by CBC3. Also go for pulmonary function test if he suffers from recurrent wheeze and coughs.4. For symptomatic treatment give Syp. Chlorpheniramine or Benadryl.5.

She spent the following 24 hours vomiting and refusing to swallow her own saliva. Today she is drinking and even had a little chicken broth. My question is: why does she vomit and not swallow saliva? This is the third time it has happened in the last 12 months. The two previous occasions were connected to a loose milk-tooth where she could taste blood in her mouth - then the vomiting starts and she is truly poorly for 3 or 4 days. The first time, 12 months ago, she had a very traumatic experience with a loose-ish tooth that got knocked almost out. It caused a lot of blood, and of course this all seems to be related to that episode. The second episode was seemingly minor - the tiniest drop of blood. I am interested so that I can help her in the future. Thanks!","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,I truly sympathize with her. She surely has gone through tough times. Let me assure you , there seems to be no problem with her. The vomiting can be secondary to the bad experience she had in the past. The taste of blood itself might be giving her the nauseated feeling every time. She just needs moral support. Also, only other possibility is that she might be having gastritis which might cause that feel. So the remedy for that during next time is, give her an antacid when she has such feeling, she will feel better also Psychologically. I hope this might help and I wish her good health.

The doctor ordered a CBC and Ferritin test. Could this be a sign he has something more serious? She said the test we did in office also indicated he had small red blood cells. To my knowledge, I was tested for sickle cell in college and it was negative. My husband is not sure if his sickle cell status and his mother s sisters have lupus (perhaps his mom too). Could this be cancer, leukemia, blood or autoimmune disorder?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,I totally understand your concern. If you start thinking of possibility, you might end up worrying for ever. Why can't you think of a possibility of simple iron deficiency anemia which is very much possible in this age group. I appreciate your efforts to work him up for possible other causes but I would suggest not to get too stressed about the possibilities. Your child is under the monitor of a good pediatrician and he will do what is needed to figure out what your child has got. Let him take the stress and you enjoy and care about child's nutrition and daily needs. I am sure its not going to be any major illness. If that was the case , the doctor would have not ordered for just simple CBC and ferritin. So relax and take care."},{"Patient":"Physical Colour: Brown Consistency: Soft Mucous: Absent Blood: Nil Parasite: Nil Chemical Reaction: Acidic Microscopical Pus cells: + Macrophages: + Fat cells: + Veg. cells: +++ All other microscopical parameter reported NIL.

The problem for your child seems to be due to incomplete evacuation of bowel every time he passes. From your part, you need to encourage him to take as much of green leafy vegetable and fiber rich diet. He needs to take as Much fluids in a day as he can. Fruit juices also be of good help. You can wait for a week after these dietary modifications. If his bowel still doesn't get better , I would suggest you consult a pediatric Gastroenterologist for further evaluation.

This redness can happen if you child is on diaper which causes rash or due to acidic irritation of stools also. Giving lactulose will surely help him. Along with that I would advice you to apply siloderm cream 3-4 times daily over the red area which will help in giving a soothing effect for him and also help in healing in the anal area.

I believe I have had this since I was a 15 yr old gymnast. I am now 31 and have had 2 children. Since the birth of my 2nd child the pain in the left side has at times been awful. I am a runner and have run 2 marathons (post children). I rarely see a bulge there anymore but it can be uncomfortable to cough at times. There are some occasions where I feel no pain at all. About a year ago I had an ultrasound and they couldn t find anything. I refuse to be cut open unless the dr is sure that there is in fact a hernia. I have also had 2 miscarriages this past year, and feel like the pain is getting worse. My ob has checked me for cysts and any other gynelogical problem and I am all clear, but I am desperate for answers.

We have battled lice two times in her 9 years.","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,Its hard to identify the type of insect on the scalp. But if its itching that badly then there must be some lice or some fungal infection on the scalp. Best is to use a good shampoo which is mostly antifungal shampoos . these will help in relieving infection and most of times itching resolves.

Especially if he is again and again getting exposed to dust, smoke or some allergens which might be triggering his problems. You need to identify those and try to avoid those exposures in him. Few measures like dusting mattresses and drying in sunlight twice in a week. Wet mopping of floors. Avoid smoke inside home. If such measures doesn't help, then it might be necessary to start him on preventer medications.

But you need to understand that the best thing is happening to your child. If a doc has noticed some infection in throat, then that's the cause of fever. There can be many other possibilities. It normally takes 48-72 hrs after starting an antibiotic to see the response in fever. So you have no choice but to be patient. As far as your concern regarding dengue is, yes it could be dengue also only because there is epidemic going on but the fact is there is no specific treatment you need to change other than that you make sure child takes plenty and plenty of liquids which will also help if its not dengue. So don't worry about any other possibilities. If fever doesn't subside even after taking antibiotics for 2-3 days then you need to get blood tests and also urine test. Hope your child recovers soon.

Best thing you doing is that you already started treatment for throat infection. However recurrence of fever with other symptoms are suggestive of a viral illness similar to dengue.

If symptoms doesn't subside in next 24 hrs, you need to get his blood tested and test for dengue also.

Post nasal drip xsn be due to allergic irritation in your child. You need to take certain measures at home to avoid allergen exposure like wet mopping, prevent smoke at home, avoid ice cold foods, washing and sun drying mattress twice a week atleast. Place the child at night sleep with head slightly elevated around 30 degress which will reduce the drip.For long term, I feel you need to start on preventer medications like monteleucast but better to consult a pediatrician and get evaluated properly again before starting that.

The possibilities are a severe diaper rash if she is using one which is not commonly done in this age and other more likely possubikty Is a fungal infection.

I have carefully worked through your case, and can well realize your health worries. Being your physician, I want to assure, I will take care all of your medical concerns.Heimlich's maneuver or the 'abdominal thrusts' is a life saving procedure in patients who chokes.Sometimes due to the rapid and string thrusts there may be a muscular spasm, tissue injury to the digestive system that is all naturally related to the procedure. There may also be a strong push on the rib cage and that may cause pain due to spasm or physical injury to the intercostal muscles or the Costochondral joints may hurt due to the over flexion and over extension at those functionally immobile joints. The torque produced due to the thrushes may lead to pain in those joints.You need not worry as there are very less chances of rib fracture or some serious injury (although it may happen in inexperienced hands).Apply Bengay ultrastretch ointment over the painful areas and massage gently. Take a heating blanket (or heat pad) and wrap around her rib cage. It will give soothing effects to her.Give her Tylenol too for pain relief and to reduce inflammation. The burping issues can be handled with diet rich in vegetables, fruits, salads, salmon and eggs; and, by adding Citrucel dietary fiber in her diet with a plenty of water.If she gets no benefits, go for a digital X Ray of the chest to see any fracture or joint issues.Hope I answered all of your questions.

Being your physician, I want to assure, I will take care all of your medical concerns.Yes, definitely that is due to the reaction of the body to the egg proteins. No problem if he is allergic to eggs. Egg contains mainly the proteins ans you may fulfill this deficiency from other proteins. Salmon is a good protein. Dairy foods are rich in proteins. Give him full cream milk and yogurt. But avoid giving him the eggs. He is genetically made to be allergic to eggs and nothing is going to work.

So its totally safe and even recommended to give these medicines together and I would suggest you to follow what the pediatrician has adviced. Take care."},{"Patient":"My 5 year old son complains of stomach pain and vomits what he eats. This happens for evry 2-3 months, and evrytime when we go to doctor, he prescribes Junior Lanzol 15mg tablets. Since this is happening very often, I am more worried. Is there something more I should be looking into?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,This symptom you mentioned are very commonly seen in this age group children, especially they eat what ever they can. One such episode which is not too severe and is relived by junior lanzol every 2-3 mths is not a matter of concern. If I were your pediatrician, I would have given albendazole just to take care of any stomach bug. Gt his diet regularized and make sure he never misses breakfast. A discipline in his dietary habits will sort out his issue to a great extent. Take care."},{"Patient":"hi my name is stephanie broughton. my 5 year old daughter is 5 years old and she has a sinus infection and a ear infection. shes been sick for about 5 days. im getting scared because she doesnt really want to eat anything. she only pick at food here and there. shes already small and shes losing weight. this is really making me nervous. when should i get worried?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,Any infection in a 5 Yr old can be very disturbing and troublesome for the child especially an ear infection can be real bad. The appetite gets bad only cos of the infection. Good thing is child is on treatment for the same and soon the recovery will happen. Dont worry much about the weight loss. keep trying to give him as much feed as she can take. Fluids, juices all will help. Dont force her with any specific food. Once she recovers, she will gain all her lost weight in no time. So be patient and let the infection get treated completely first. Wish your child good health.

I think she is having a reaction to the medication . What should i do and what should i give her to stop the itching.","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,There is a good possibility its a reaction to the drug. First thing to be done is to immediately stop all medicines. Give plenty of liquids for child to take orally. As far as itching is concerned, you can apply lactocalamine lotion over the red itchy areas that would comfort. Before starting any medicines to reduce itching, I would advice you to consult a doctor so that those lesions can be seen. Hope your child recovers soon. Take care."},{"Patient":"Our 5 year old daughter has had a low grade (100.2) fever just about every morning for the past 5 weeks. Initially, she broke out in hives for 5 days and when going to the doctor he said she had only 1 tonsil inflammed but xrays of the soft tissue showed there were no cycsts on the tonsil. She is congested and takes flovent twice a day. Full blood work was drawn and everything came back normal, including negative results for mono. She s cranky in the morning but when she comes home she is fine the rest of the day. She s getting about 11 hours of sleep every nite. Our ENT visit is not for another 2 weeks. How concerned should we be about this every day low grade fever? Could it be phnemonia?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,100.2 is a very low grade fever which can be normal in pediatric age group especially if the fever is not causing any discomfort but if she is cranky then its significant fever. It can't be pneumonia, as she has no symptoms suggestive of that. Throat infection is a possibility which is not completely recovered. You have to eventually get ent consult done to be sure everything is fine. You need'nt be worried as all the investigations are normal. Take care. Hope my info helped you."},{"Patient":"I have a 9 year old son with a heart condition.he has had a fever on and off for the past week.sometimes he s burning up and other times he s cold to the touch.

Very unlikely its related to heart condition. Although I am not aware of what condition he has but symptoms you mentioned doesn't make me think in lines of any fresh heart problem.

His temp got back to over 35 within minutes Is he ok? Should I go to hospital to check him for hypothermia?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,I dont think you need to go to get him checked for this purpose as of now. Warming up is the priority and if he gets warmed up its well and good. Temperature can go down depending on the clothing you are offering your child and temperature that is maintained around him. If after rewarming him also his temperature doesn't increase then surely you need to take him to hospital.

The most likely cause could be Musculoskeletal pain.Please take Muscle relaxants with the advice of your doctor. Another cause can be Duodenal ulcer which requires PPI inhibitor like Rabeprazole.You can add Antispasmodic like Dicyclomine.

Her heart beat is very strong and you can feel the beat through her clothes when I lay my hand on her chest. It feels like she had such a rapid heart rate, but yet when I have done a home blood pressure rest her heart bear per minute is normal, varies from 85 to 100 per minute on different days. I have taken her to the GP and has checked her and said it was all normal.Please could you tell me what your thoughts are.Many thanks. As I'm extremely worried.","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,Heart beats can normally increase during certain times during excitement, increased physical activity, fever , increased heat etc but the sleeping or resting heart rate is usually normal. You need to figure out wen does the heart beat increase or become evident in your girl. If no reason for the rate to be high and still she has that high heart beat then its abnormal. Heart beats can be felt normally in some children especially if they are thin built. I understand your concern , so its better you consult a cardiologist to get an ECG and echo evaluation done which are simple non invasive tests and that will rest all your worries. Hope I made myself clear to you. Take care."},{"Patient":"My daughter suffered from seizures during fever at the age of 1.5 Yrs for the first time. The second episode was on 29th of July and now she is 4 yrs old. she weighs 15Kgs and iam not sure bout her height. She was taken to Paedeatric Neurologist and he suggested that as parents for your satisfaction we can have EEG test done which will assess the risk in future. I stay in bangalore and would like to know what extent it is required to conduct the test.","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,Seizures within 24hrs of onset of fever and lasting less than 5 mins is commonly seen in this age group children till 6 yrs. Especially if there is a strong family history of febrile seizures then there is much more possibility if this. It usually doesn't happen of the fever is controlled well from the very onset. Its called simple febrile seizures and if that is the case, no investigation is required. But if any atypical features like, seizure onset after 24 hrs of fever onset, more than 1 episode in 24hrs, occuring beyond 6 yrs, child has development delay etc needs evaluation with eeg.Having said that, getting an eeg done just for completion is not a harm. Its a non invasive test and won't affect in management. Hope this clears your query. Happy yo help. Take care."},{"Patient":"My 28 month old son has a terrible cold, hes about 31lbs. Symptoms include: 103 fever, mucus coming from his eyes and nose, vomiting, sore throat, cough and he has slight ahsma . He is not eating but is drinking. I am taking him to his pediatrician tomorrow because fever has lasted over 72hrs and every day a new symptom pops up. he is now complaining about his 4bottom teeth? What could this be, why are his teeth now hurting and why are the symptoms multiplying?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,I understand your concern and 103 temp is quite high for the age. But I would like to the you at this point not to worry much because its all possible in a simple viral upper respiratory infection which needs not much of treatment other than being patient and time. All you need to do is give paracetamol round the clock, plenty of oral fluids and rest. You can use saline nasal drops if nose is blocked and congested. Teeth pain and severe body pain can be part of symptoms of viral fever. If fever lasts for another 48 hrs more, he needs a blood test and urine test jUST to rule out any other infection.

It can normally be there in this age group children and can be related to some infection in ear, nose, throat area. But, the bleeding through the nose is quite significant I must say and good you are getting it evaluated. Only once blood tests come, we can derive at a diagnosis of what possible problem could be and if its secondary to some infection, then the lump can be correlated. Hope your child gets well soon. Take care."},{"Patient":"My 9 yr old son has been complaining of severe headache for 3 days now, he says it feels like there is water in his head. He cant stand the light either. I am wondering could this be allergy s or something like tonsilitis, which my nephew had about a week ago.","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,Severe headache is surely mattern of concern especially because its been there for 3 days now. I would like to know more details on it as in where exactly it's hurting in the head and what's the type of pain also is there any factor that would relieve the pain to atleast some extent. Feeling of water in the head can suggest at possible sinusitis which can be secondary to upper respiratory infection and due to blockage of sinuses. As of now, I would suggest that he does steam inhalation regularly atleast 3 times daily. An anti histamine can also help a lot. If nose is blocked , nasal decongestant drops would help further. Hope my advice is of some help. Happy to clear any further queries. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have a 6 year old daughter who nearly always has very cold hands and feet.

There is some swelling now, bruising, he s congested, but he has a 100.4 temp. Should he be seen by a dr? No bleeding. What would they do if it was broken?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,If I were your pediatrician, I would suggest you consult an orthopediacian or an ent surgeon, only to be very sure there is no problem to be sorted out. If at all there is a fracture, the management will vary depending on the type and extent of fracture. Mild one needs a small plaster bandage but a major one might need surgery. However, it doesn't sound like a major fracture or something. He might have had some soft tissue injury which is causing swelling and nose congestion. Hot compresses, nasal de congestant drops and steam inhalation will help till you see some specialist. Hope child gets well soon. Take care."},{"Patient":"My 3 year old has been complaining of neck pain. Last night she tried to look up at an airplane and winched in pain and held her neck. It s appears to only be the right side. We felt a small lump or knot at the base of her neck on the right side. Could it just be a muscle knot like adults get?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,It seems like your child has torticollis that means muscle spasm of the neck which causes such severe pain. The knot feel can be muscle or even a lymph node which is very common in this age group. I would advice you to ask her to rest her neck and not to twist and turn a lot. Hot compresses Can be applied over the painful site. If too much severe pain , a pain killer cream would help immensely. Hope she gets well soon.

If I get upset the pain is worse. when i wake i am sweating and want to do a wee. the pain seems to be relieved but is still there.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM. Thank you for your query. From your description, I hope the presence of an ulcer has been ruled out? Owing to your presentation, an ulcer should be ruled out, with the help of an endoscopic examination. As you mentioned, you were diagnosed with an inflamed bowel. You are on a proton pump inhibitor which will help in reducing gastric acid irritation and gas production. It would also be advisable to add anti-spasmodic medication to your routine as this will greatly help in treating your condition. Please visit the doctor for a more elaborate diagnosis as just inflammation of the bowel is not sufficient. I hope I have succeeded in answering your questions, you could write back to me anytime for further clarifications. Best wishes."},{"Patient":"Concerns for my daughter My daughter is two months old she was born after two days of being in labour and them breaking my waters n bringing my labour on by a drip then using the suction cup to pull her out after being dilated for two days when she was born I noticed she would shake her leg like a quiver but never thought much of it as I thought it might be her going to the toilet until a week later it mooved from that leg to her arm and mouth on the same side eventually it came to a point where her hole body would shake at time where I felt her spine shake and she would spew or have white frothy bubbles at her mouth I took her to see a peadiatrician who simply said it was a banine thing and she would grow out of it and it slowly stopped for a while but as of a week ago her legs and mouth have started to shake again but its not just that I have noticed she cant moove both legs at the same time she can only get one to moove with the other stopping half way the same thing with her arms she is also very stiff constantly and if her hands are open or closed when she goes stiff it takes her a while to close or open them again I have also noticed that her toes curl up and she cant uncurl them and has alot of trouble sleeping as in having to be held and as soon as you put her down she wakes up I took her to the doctor again and two doctors suggested I take her back to the peadiatrician as he was spose to do an ecg and blood test and she needs one done I want another opionion as to what another doctor may think this all could be thank you","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,I am really sorry to hear about your child going through all this trouble. Your description I must say is exhaustive and very informative. It seems like your daughter is having episodes of seizure like activity and its gradually worsening. Tightening and curving of limbs are suggestive of abnormality related to brain. I totally agree with the fact that the child needs a pediatric consult at the earliest. If I were your pediatrician, I would get an eeg and an MRI brain apart from routine blood testing. Eventually she will need a long term follow up with neurologist. These data might be disturbing for you but it's all very important for a complete workup and I would suggest to not worry about the future and first work in lines of confirming what the problem with the child is.

As long as there are no loose stools or blood in stools, you needn't worry much about. I honestly feel he might not even need those many medicines which he is getting. However if a doctor had prescribed, there should be some genuine reason and so follow that as per instructions. Make sure he gets a good fibre rich diet, fruits, liquids and the will recover soon.

As long as she is not having any such persistent activities and she is otherwise behaving well, feeding well and developing well, you needn't worry. If it gets worse, the only thing that needs to be done is an eeg test to check if any seizure like activity on. Hope I cleared your query.

The white of her eye is the only thing that is effected, around the eye looks fine.","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,Red eye in 6 mth old can be due to some allergic reaction secondary to some foreign body like dust of something irritating the eye. Also it can mean a possible conjunctivitis which is infection of the eye. As a home remedy , I would rrequest you to wash the eye with clean water multiple times a day. You might need to start on antibiotic eye drops . however it's better child is examined by a pediatrician before you start any medical therapy.

It is very dark red and i am guessing that it is no wonder he will not eat or drink. Should I take him to emerg?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,The lesion you notice is not a normally seen lesion and as you rightly figured he not eating can be because of this problem. I suggest you to consult a pediatrician but surely its not an emergency. The consultation is to confirm what the problem is and to decide on if any treatment required.

Do they relate to sex or not?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,There are no skin lesions similar to what you have described which are gender specific. However in order to tell what those spots are, I would need a better description as in the location of the spots, duration of onset and how its progressed, any associated factors etc and eventually those spots have to be seen to get a confirm diagnosis.

Any ideas?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,I understand your concern. Let me assure you there seems to be no problem with your son especially because he is not symptomatic. The possibilities I can think of with your description are a tight skin fold, penile muscle tissue or just the scrotal covering rim. All these are normal and they can seem abnormal at times. So you should not worry and let your child enjoy his life. However, confirm diagnosis can only be made of the so called abnormality is seen by some specialist.

Few more details like his age, how was he developmentally before the incident, how significant fall was it meaning from how high and what was the immediate situation after fall- did he loose his consciousness and have vomiting etc would actually help in arriving at a better conclusion. Having said that, we cannot neglect the possibility of internal brain injury with these symptoms which can present like abnormal symptoms in children.

Best treatment in such situarion like this is to support with as much liquids as possible. Fruit juices, rice porridge, tender coconut water, bread etc are usually liked.

Bluishness of the feet alone is mainly suggestive of temperature change at the site leading to constriction of vessels and bluishness. I would at this juncture advice you to do the beat you can to warm the peripheries and dont worry much about the color. Keeping the body close to your body is the best way to keep warm. However if the bluish disxolouration is significant and is noticed in other areas like lips tongue etc or if persistent inspire of all your efforts to keep limb warm, you need to consult a cardiologist just to be sure that child's heart is functioning perfectly well.

Before I go on answering your query, would like to know little more about the problem if these lesions appear anywhere else in the body like palms, soles, mouth? in that case, it can be something called as hand foot mouth disease and its a self limiting problem, needs only oral hydration and soothing agents like oil over the lesions. If its only on the site you mentioned, its hard to comment on without having a look at it. Kindly check if there is any pus collecting in those lesions. If not, just apply some moisturizing cream like cetaphil moisturising cream which will decrease the itch. Give him plenty of fluids. No other therapy is usually needed.

I would suggest the baby to be breastfed more aggressively every 2 hourly. That's the best you can do at home.

She has gone through so much already, but good thing is she seems to have recovered well from most of it. CRP being high with many neutrophils suggests some infection still going on in your child or may be recovering. If I were your pediatrician, I would get blood cultures done in your child, at least 3 cultures half hour apart from different sites, firstly to look for any infection within the blood that can be cultured and also see if any possibility of infective endocarditis. For a completion of workup, better to consult a cardiologist and get an heart evaluation done as well. Hope that answers your query.

My baby was pale & not breathing & it took them about 4 minutes to resuscitate him. Baby s eyes were opened & he was crying. He was then put in the incubator & taken to the nursery where he has been kept for 2 days. I have been told that he might have some brain damage due to him not breathing & not having oxygen to the brain. Also he did not get the transfusion of blood from the placenta due to the cord being cut. Could this pose a problem in his brain development? & if so is there anything we can do now that he is only 2 days old to avoid future problems (such as giving him iron supplement to create red blood cells for oxygen in his blood)? I have seen him & he seems fine & is very responsive & has good reflexes. He does however have blood clots in the white of his eye, around the pupil & at the corner of his eye. Is this due to the umbilical cord strangling him or something else & will the blood clots clear up?","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to HCM,First of all congratulations on having a baby and your are lucky that in spite of some problems post delivery your son is doing good. The blood clots you notice in the eyes will surely clear off completely, do not worry about it. Your baby now being well active, feeding well and good reflexes suggest that the brain is well functioning and preserved well. I would at this point suggest, not to worry about past and enjoy your baby, leave the rest to your pediatrician who will assess him on every visit. Hope this clarifies your doubts. Happy to answer any further queries. Take Care."},{"Patient":"My 18 month old has an ALP of 7,095. Doctors referred us to a specialist and they did an ultrasound of the liver and it looks okay. They drew more blood and all of the tests except for the ALP isoenzymes test are back. They are normal. Is it possible the first test was inaccurate? I know that bone growth can cause high ALP but the 7095 seems very high. Could it just be from a growth spurt. Still awaiting the results of the isoenzymes test. He seems perfectly healthy otherwise except for some chronic diarrhea which appears to be clearing up after 6 weeks.","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HCM,Such a high ALP is not normally seen in this age group children. I must appreciate your team of doctors who got the workup done well for your baby. Looking at all the data, it seems that the value was a lab error and you need not worry about it. However, lets wait for the isoenzyme test too which is most probably come out normal as well.

I would be interested to know if he can do little bit of activity which normally any child of his age group can do without any tiredness? I mean to say, does he gets really tired to have to rest on doing normal activities like breast feeding or drinking from bottle etc. If that's the case, I would suggest you to get him evaluated by a pediatric cardiologist and make sure his heart is normal. And if that's normal, starting iron syrup for him would help. Happy to clear any further doubts.

She also says it feels like something keeps popping in her elbow/arm. Should I take her to get x-rays?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,More than an xray, she needs to be examined by an orthopedician. It most probably is a strain and needs partial immobilization for recovery and xray is gonna be normal in that case. So I would suggest you to consult an orthopedic specialist before getting xray.

Thanks for writing to us. The symptoms that you are feeling are not likely to be related to pregnancy. These are more likely to be due to a mild gastric upset and is likely to subside in next few days after taking a supportive treatment.

He fell down from the baby cot (3 feet high) 1 month ago, i did not found any bump or swollen part on his head after he fall down and he looks ok and everything act like normal. 1 week later, he fall sick, with fever and vomitting, I brought him to Doctor and told doctor he fell down from bed 1 week ago. Doctor said the sickness due to my baby got frightened and not because of the falling down form bed. 1 month later, we only found out his left side, above the ear part has a big soft bump, I am so worry and bring him to pediatrician. doctor said the bump was due to the fell down from bed and ask us why we only noticed now. she said the soft bump is actually the bleeding in the tissue part, it can only go off several months or remains a smaller size thereafter. she said we can choose to go for CT scan if we worry the bleeding go into the brain. She said since our baby acting normal, we can ignore the scan. Doctor, i am really worry and need more opinion and advice. I really worry the bleeding will affect his growth in future","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,I understand your concern. I would like to reassure at the outset not to worry about your child. The sift bump could be due to fall and it must have been there before also which was not noticeable. The reason you able to feel it means its only under skin and not deep inside which is good. Vomiting very unlikely is because of that as its more than a month since bleed. However, the best thing is to get a Ct brain, so that we can be fully sure her brain is not involved. I would suggest you consult a neurologist or a neurosurgeon for the same. Hope I answered your query and happy to provide any further help."},{"Patient":"Hi I d be very grateful if you d answer my question, please. My daughter was prescribed Flucloxacillin (& Amoxicillin) yesterday evening (for an infected post-surgery scar; the surgery was just over a year ago & this keeps happening so she s booked to her surgeon re: ? stitch left later this month) but I m finding it difficult to give all doses of the Flucox as directed. My question is: may I give Fluclox to my 16month old followed by (150ml ish) cows milk? She always has milk at 7am then goes back to sleep until nearer 9am (lucky me, I know!) when she then has breakfast. I can do the other 3 doses on empty stomach more easily.

He is lethargic, and at times pale with dark circles under eyes. I am anemic so I assumed this was a possible problem for him too. I was told to feed him more veggies, but this seems more complex than that. I also noticed recently that his eyes are dilated all the time. I ve done my research and know this is normal in young children, however even in bright light, his barely constrict, and then flicker in and out. Does the eyes have anything to do with tiredness, or are they both separate problems? He is too young to be so tired. Every doctor I see tells me all tests say he is normal, but his daily actions say different. I just want to figure out why my son is so tired and help him out. Thank you!","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,I understand your concern and appreciate that you did what is just needed to evaluate his concern. Good thing is hemoglobin is normal. I feel you need to focus more on his diet. Give him regular fruits and plenty of liquids. You can try giving multivitamin syrup once a day. If hemoglobin is borderline normal, it's worth starting iron syp also. If he gets excessively tired after regular activity then h needs a complete evaluation including echo of heart to check if heart is normal.

As you rightly thought even the gaseous distension or a colic abdomen can cause this scream. You needn't do anything for that. Make sure you burp child well before sleep.

She then vomited on Sunday morning after she had been up for about 30 minutes and then again this morning right when she woke up at Daycare. She has not fever and seems to play fine afterwards. She did have a cold and cough over Thanksgiving for about 8 or 9 days but is really over it. She does have an ocassional cough from time to time.

She saw a liquid filled sac really small that shes watching to see if its a cyst or not, or to see what happens. She did a ultrasound to take a better look and whatever was on the right side is gone but something on the left which shes watching. I still have really bad pain on the right only when i come on my menstraul and it lingers for a couple days after. Do you think this could be endometriosis. I also have noticed throught this that my cheeks on the inside of my mouth look swollen and i have looks like white patches on the gums and cheeks. The grey came first which looks like a line in the cheek. Also in the left corner of my mouth seems like there is irritation there sometimes. I do have some work that needs to be done on my teeth which the dentist said one tooth cannot be saved and the other tooth could but its also decaying also. So do you think that could be because of the bad teeth in my mouth?","Doctor":"Hi Brownappril, The problems you are describing as pain on the left side of your stomach can be because of many reason. Endometriosis can the one of the important cause. Depending upon the pain description that you  have more pain during the period, it shows that the chances of endometriosis is there and it need to be taken care. Now depending upon the severity of pain and duration of this problem and other investigation you can be prescribed some hormonal medications which can help to control this endometriosis and can regress this condition. Most of the time medication is sufficient to treat the condition, but some time other intervention may be required. In the mean time you also have to work up with the USG finding of cyst which may be the cause of the pain and after proper examination and investigation only something can be decided. The other problem of your oral cavity can be because of the problem which is because of the decaying tooth. I would suggest you to have consultation with your dentist at the earliest so that other complication associated with decaying tooth can be prevented and in the meantime try to maintain proper oral hygiene.

Currently her only safe food is Elecate jr unless we can get a pass with apples.","Doctor":"Your child is 14 months old and can only express pain and discomfort by crying.Moreover she does have allergic status severe enough to cause nose bleeds.My suggestion is to continue elecate,stop apples ,even if not directly related ,supplement with good multivitamins and a hypoallergenisc plain rice cereals ,instead  fruits for the time being.Go slow and steady one ,at a time and stop with the slightes expression of pain or discomfort"},{"Patient":"my baby was born with a lesion that looked like a scrape on her forehead above her left eyebrow.

Tonight he has started vomiting and also has the symptoms of the cough/cold I am currently recovering from, which are a fever, cough and headaches.

His doctor has told us they are nothing to be concerned about, without even looking at his nose. My son becomes quiet distressed each time his nose starts to bleed and I would really appreciate some advice on how we can minimize them. He is very big for his age - 125cm tall and 35kg.","Doctor":"First of all 35 kg for a 4 year old child is 10 kg overweight .and this excess fat in and arount the airways can cause obstruction to his breathing .This obstruction will reduce free flow of air through nose and make him prone to nasal congestion and bleeds --that will scare any child and more so the mother .Your son has to have an ENT exam ,to see if the inside of nose is crusted or the lining is damaged --if it is simple like this usually creams will be given to prevent dryness .the second is check out for allergies ,and also cause for his increased weight ,diet,.Also get a blood test to check his platlet count and hemoglobin to be on the safer side"},{"Patient":"HI i had my appendix removed about 9 months ago and i ve went back 3 other times because of the same symptoms and pain they relieved it.

Immediately after delivery docter had sent his blood for clinical diagnosis, his hemoglobin was only 3%. his heart was pumping very fast. Imidiately blood was transfused in his body while old blood in his body taken out. In whole blood of the body was changed after it his hemoglobin was 15%.

But still not exceptable, anyhow baby started coughing few days ago right after feeding and it continued every feed. I want to get her some help do you think that s the cause ? Please help thanks","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,Cough in a breast fed infant especially after every feed means there is something to do with her feeding technique or swallowing issue. First of all mother should feed with proper position of the baby, head slightly above the plane of body and not hanging down which can cause slight aspiration and cough. If position is perfect and cough continues the possibility of gastro esophageal reflux should be considered and for that you need to consult a pediatric gastro enterologist if you feel its a significant problem.However smoking is not at all acceptable in a breast feeding mother, it can surely cause Ill effects in babies lungs. But hard to say if that's the direct reason for this cough in baby.Take care."},{"Patient":"my daughter is 6 months and has a boil/staph infection on her bottom.. i took her to the pediatrician when i first noticed it.he told me what to do, and gave me some ointment and oral antibiotic. once i put a hot compress on it, it formed a white head. so i popped it. stuff came out, but only when i squeeze it the more i squeeze she crys harded... it never leaked.. and doesnt have a head. but really hard, and bruised and red. how do i know if all the stuff is out..?? please help!!","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,If it's hard and painful that means the stuff is still inside. Once the contents have been removed then the swelling usually softens and pain reduces drastically.I would not suggest you to give pain to your girl. What you doing with hot compress is really good and continue doing it. That will soothen her and soften the contents inside and will in due course be expelled. Hope your child gets well soon.

They gave him IV calcium last night and it only brought his level up from 8.3 to8.4 so there giving him more this morning. The docotors won t tell us anything what we do know we ve had to make them tell us. Can you pls help me understand what s going?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,Its a shame that your doctors dont seem to be explaining you what's happening. But don't worry, I am sure they must be waiting to get some more reports to finally give a complete talk to you. With the info you provided, child seems to be having low calcium which is not so uncommon thing seen in neonates. The most common cause is secondary to vitamin D deficiency which is very commonly seen in neonates these times. The best thing to do is to correct calcium whixh your doctors are doing. Having said that 8.3 calcium is not too low to be so worried about. The more of concern is the jaundice in the baby. However, I need more details regarding mother and child blood groups , gestational age of the baby and feeding status before I could comment more regarding that. Hope I was of some help to you.

Pneumonia being treated with augmentin is perfect and your child seems to have recovered completely from that. Regarding HSP, hard to ccomment on without having a look at it. Most HSP doesn't warrant starting of steroids in this case prednisolone and its a self limiting illness especially with wbc being so high. But I am sure your doctor has a reason to do so. Its better be discussed with him. I am sure you child will recover very soon. Take care."},{"Patient":"My two year old son has a discharge from his right ear.

Should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,Discharge in a ear is always a matter of concern especially if its in a child who had tubes in ear, then its very much a concern. Your description tells me that your child has ear infection and that needs to be taken care of urgently.

But its not unsafe to use it for so long. Having said that, for your child to be so sensitive for so long there should be some trigger factor in your home or in the area that child is coming in contact with. You need to identify that and get it off from his life, then things should fall in place. Keep away from pollen, dust, smoke, cold etc triggers . wet mopping of home floor. Dusting and drying in sun of blankets etc are a few helpful tips. Take care. Wish your child a good health."},{"Patient":"My nephew who is 5 months old now had rotovirus when he was 2 months old. He suffers from abdominal pains at night time when in his cot. His mum has been told that this virus has stripped the lining of his stomach and that any food that she gives him will irratate his bowel and cause him pain. He is a very big baby and is being breast fed but has been getting some solids during the day for the last month. She has been told not to stop giving him his solids as although this would help with the tummy pains when she started up again with solids she would be back as square one. She has been told to stay away from the starchy foods such as mashed potatoe and pumpkin etc. IS this true and if so what sorts of food should she be staying away from and or giving him to help with this situation?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,First of all rotaviral infection can be debilitating in few cases but if your nephew has recovered months back then you need not worry at all about the past. As you have mentioned he Is a big baby, so his nutrition seems to be good . so that doesn't go well with the intestinal problem you have been told. I would suggest to keep giving solids once a day as you have already started 1 mth ago. Try not to give more times solids for a month now. You need yp continue his breast milk feeding as of now and that is good enough. you can start ragi or cerelac feeds after 6 months of age. Hope I was clear with my answer. Let me know if you have any query on this. Wish your nephew a great health.

Pelvic tilt if noticed in xray is something which cannot be brushed off. Your child especially has problem in walking. So if I were your doctor, I would do a complete neurological examination of your child to see if any deficits persists and get a pediatric neurologist opinion for the same. Tilt can be due to some neurological problem on that side. Hope your child a good health. Take care."},{"Patient":"My granddaughter has an almond shaped lump behind her left ear.

I do manage to get rid of the pain within a couple of hours after quite a few pain killers, codeine forte, plus nurofen and hour later, plus another couple of paracetmol half an hour later... it does eventually ease and go away. And the next day, you would not think any thing is wrong with me, apart from a little tenderness, sensitivity in the middle abdomen where the pain was. I do get sweaty throughout and feel like, or do vomit ... Now here is the interesting bit, the attacks have been every 12 weeks since August 2011, not a week more or less... in fact I can anticipate them coming on, not feel them, but know they are coming... my last ultrasound just after the first one only showed 1 gallstone and no inflammation, so I am therefore not convinced that it is the gallbladder that is the issue.. I am going for another ultrasound next week, but am concerned that by then there will be no inflammation from this attack. Am interested in your thoughts.. I am also very reluctant to get my gall bladder out, due to other repercussions and sometimes not even curing the pain that I have been experiencing.","Doctor":"Hi The symptoms that you have mentioned may be due to Gall stone.You can experience pain,Vomiting even without inflammation.The pain may be in Upper middle abdomen also. As you are having symptomatic gall stones,better you get operated. As there is Laparoscopic technique available now,you can get discharged from the hospital with in few days after surgery.

Although you made a great attempt at describing the rash. Rash such as this in this age group can range anything from a non specific rash to heat rash to allergic or infective. As your child is otherwise well there is a high possibility of this being rash secondary to heat. Best would be to keep the area moist by applying cetaphil moisturizing cream and nothing else on it.

First of all it is not a reaction to anesthesia but a slight complication which can happen to any person undergoing anesthesia. your child seems to be having an issue with upper airway obstruction that can be congenital meaning present since birth or can develop secondary to any infection and that seems to be causing snoring and sounds while breathing. The airway can be narrowing which is why anesthetist wanted to evaluate him and that's I feel is the right way to go about. Requiring surgery or not is a very far off thing to decide as of now.

Other things you need to look for is any puffiness around eyes and any heaviness of breath which can in rare situations happen when allergy is very severe. In such a case, you need to rush to emergency room soon. Else, keep giving your child plenty of fluids. I hope I clarified your query. Hope your child gets well soon.

Thank You!","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,I can understand the uneasy feeling you must be going through. The good thing is that the Ultrasound abdomen is normal which means if anything major mass would have been picked up. Even better is that your son is otherwise totally fine and even his feeding and bowel habits good. Only concern is that the doc is feeling the so called mass every time. Although I would like to say that it must be an insignificant feeling in the abdomen but before That I would suggest go ahead and get a Ct scan of the abdomen. I know its expensive and problem of radiation exists but its better you confirm there is no problem rather than living in a doubt for ever.Only one possibility I can think of is a hypertrophic pyloric stenosis which can present as a mass in the area you mentioned but that shud have presented much earlier than this.Bottom line is get a Ct scan and that's the best way to confirm.

The causes can vary from a simple infection related change to a major abnormal dilatation of the heart or can be normal in some children. It surely warrants an echo evaluation and hope there won't be anything abnormal finding.Dark spots on the chest is not very clear to me.

If consciousness is normal then seizures can be ruled out completely.3.

For the night what you can do is have a tub of Luke warm water and put some salt into it and make him sit inside that by immersing his genitals inside water for a duration of 20-25 mins . its called sitz bath and that will reduce his discomfort. You can show him to doctor in the morning and apply the medicine he prescribes. Hope your child gets well soon.Take care."},{"Patient":"I have a 13 month old. We noticed a few months ago that she had bilateral, fluctuant, hard masses subcutaneously above her mastoid processes. The one on the right side is now larger (almost like a knot that you would get if you have been hit with another object; or a bad bump to the head). My husband and I are trying very hard not to freak out. She seems to be in good spirits and her normal self. Her pediatricians have not made mention of this, but after noticing that there seems to be one thats enlarging, a pediatric visit is in order today. Is this normal? Should a catscan or MRI be done? Thanks","Doctor":"Hi welcome to Hcm forum,Its sounds like a lymph node which is normally seen secondary to infection around the area. So your child might have had some infection in the ear, throat or head and it doesn't sound like an alarming thing just now. However, its best judged after seeing and assessing it with naked eye and after examining. So your doc needs to be seen whenever next possible. Hope your query is answered completely. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, My 1 yr old son keeps being sick for no apparent reason, this has been going on for months. There doesn t seem to be a pattern to his sickness, it is mostly at meal times but not every meal and not every day, sometimes when he is sick at mealtimes we clean him up and he tucks into his food again unfazed. What could be the cause of this? He is generally very healthy, only the usual coughs and colds that all kids seem to get.","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,Your child seems to be having not very specific complaint. I understand the matter of concern but if he doesn't vomit every time he feeds a d it's occasionally then it doesn't seem like any problem in him. Also because he is otherwise well and loves to continue with his food, all signs that he is well . however such complaints can happen when there is a gastro esophageal reflux. I would suggest you consult a pediatric gastroenterologist or even a pediatrician for the same before ruling out that he is normal.I wish good health for your child.

At first I thought maybe his bone was just sore after lying on the floor playing. What could this be?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm.Its not very clear from your question which part of the body s left side is hurting in your son.There can be various possibilities with every part of the body. I assume that your talking about the trunk part and the possibilities I can think of is some trauma that would have lead to it most commonly in this age group is an accidental collision with a friend while playing. If there is no skin discoloration in that area and no obvious swelling, then hot fomentation and resting that area is a good enough remedy. If pain worsens or persists then you need to consult a pediatrician for this. Hope your query is cleared. Take care."},{"Patient":"My 13 yo son has CF. He has been having problems with pancreatitis. He had an ERCP in October, which seemed to help for awhile. He began having pancreatitis again. Another ERCP was performed with sphincterotomy and stent placement. That was almost 2 weeks ago and he continues to have a 4-5 pain level. His enzymes are normal. He is being treated with oxycontin and oxycodone. What could possibly be the reason for his ongoing pain?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HCM forum,Its a real sad thing to hear what your son had to go through in this young age. However I would like to assure you that he is getting the appropriate treatment for his condition. Usually such surgical procedures take a long time about 2-4 weeks depending on the child's immunity. As he had it for the second time, so healing can be a bit more slower. I would advice you to continue with the pain medications your doctor prescribed. However, if the pain is very severe than before, then its better to consult you doctor for an evaluation to make sure everything is fine. Hope he gets well soon."},{"Patient":"I was in hospital 2 times before and after Christmas with suspected appendicitis after keeping me in a week they sent me home with nothing except medicine which doesn t help.. in the last hour the pain has got very severe and is travelling down my right leg which I now cannot feel, I had severe dihorrea today and feel nausea! What is it?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for posting this question in HCM Let me explain you that a given medical problem can be due to various causes and the main objective is to establish the cause. Some patients can have multiple causes for the same problem. I mean a given problem can be multifactorial. Back to you the pain that you have may suggest a possibility of local nerve/nerve root compression.  Some patients with local gastrointestinal infection can also result in nerve compression which can cause pain too, the way you have posted here. I strongly advise you to undergo evaluation in hospital having multidisciplinary facility like general surgery, neurology and so on.. I suspect that you have local gastrointestinal infection which might have compressed local nerve. This can cause the pain you have. This can be solved by doing a MRI scan. However your doctor will guide you through examinations and various tests So you need immediate medical attention. Please don’t wait further Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"my 4 yr old daughter is suffering from frequent cough along with ear and throat pain for past 3-4 days.it started with a fever due to rain., now no fever but the above.consulted a doctor in tvm n he prescribed piriton cs,azithral 200,omnacortil but no improvements.kindly suggest the needy","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HCM forum,I understand your concern but would like to assure you that it doesn't seem like a major problem. You child seems to be having an acute upper respiratory infection which is mostly caused by a virus and the duration of a viral illness is usually 5 to 7 days. The fever not being there now is a good sign which means the infection is not too severe. Your doctor however did the right thing by giving you an antibiotic because the possibility of a bacterial infection cannot be rule out and i am sure he would have seen some evidence of infection in child's throat or ear. I would suggest you to continue the medications as prescribed (however I don't agree with the nee of omnacortil) and if fever recurs or child has worsening symptoms in the next 48 hrs, kindly go for a re visit with your doctor.

Is there any pus or leukocytes in the stools? However, if I were your pediatrician and the symptoms are very significant I would have liked to get a stool culture done and as I wait for the report would have started on oral antibiotic for the same.

This can happen in case of some congenital heart defect in the child. Its only a possibility, so dont be alarmed. It would have been better or more informative if I could see a picture of it. Anyway, if I were you, I would consult my pediatrician as these things are best seen and judged. Hope I answered your query. Hope your child gets well soon.

Dark lips can be there in neonates which usually resolves as the child grows.

The right way to do it is to compare in the child's growth card how he is doing. If his head size is growing in the normal means as plotted in his growth card and he is otherwise developmentally normal, I don't think you need to be worried. Head size is a depiction of brain growth inside and if rest are normal, then brain growth also would be normal. Hope that answers your query.

It seems like a chronic problem and sounds to me like gastro esophageal reflux. Its a very disturbing problem for the child and parents also. However the problem needs to be diagnosed for sure by doing barium swallow study. Once confirmed it is totally controllable. For this you need to see a gastro enterlogist and be on strict follow up.Remedies like keeping child's head in an elevated position while sleeping and continue lanzol junior to a long duration on 4 weeks is what I would advice apart from this.

The drug your doctor has started is a very good drug.

The cough can be due to hyperreactivity of your child's airways.

Can you please assist us with this. Her age is 28, married, one baby girl (20 months), height - 5.1","Doctor":"hello, Phleboliths are masses, deposits or growths which develop in the wall of a vein and are composed of calcium or lime. They are common in the pelvic area and are stationary and harmless; however, they can indicate the presence of more dangerous conditions or diseases. Most adults have phleboliths and are unaffected by them because they are symptomless. Their presence is usually only known after an individual has undergone X-ray imaging related to other health issues. Cause -  pelvic phleboliths develop in clots within pelvic veins that have been damaged from increased pressure caused by coughing or during the defecation process. The presence of phleboliths can be a warning sign that more severe conditions, such as colorectal hemangiomas (benign tumors), are present in the body of young patients. The masses can also indicate that a patient has an enlarged bladder, rectal distention, stomach cancer or other tumors. hope have been able to answer your query get well soon"},{"Patient":"my 10 yr.old has build up in her stomach,they said her colon is stretched.shes been taking murilax 2 times a day since october or november.shes had bowel movements every day,several times a day,accept this week.she hasn t gone since monday,could this be serious?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HcmFirst of all let me assure you that there is nothing to be alarmed about.

He also has been going through a biting stage where he tries to bit me and his Mom. Last night his Mom told me that he banged his head on his crib, as well. I have tried to comfort him when he does this as well as trying to protect him from hurting himself. When he started to do this; I would tell him No and after 3 warnings, I would put him down in his playpen and leave the room. This worked for about 3 weeks; but once he started hitting his head on the top of his playpen, as well as other hard surfaces; I ve begun to become more concerned. Is there any other alternatives to correcting this behavior? I would greatly appreciate any advice you could give me, as I am his caregiver because his Mom works really long hours. Thank you, Sincerely, Sara J. Carneal","Doctor":"Hi Mrs. Sara,Welcome to HCM forum, I understand your concern very well. Such behavior is commonly seen in children in this age group. I get plenty of patients with similar complaints and I would say my own son does this. Its a kind of attention seeking behavior that children employ. what ever you have been doing is very good and i would suggest you continue doing the same. Try not to give too much attention when he does that. If you do that, then he keeps doing it very frequently to get your attention. However, you should be keeping a track of what he is doing and if you feel its going way too much that would hurt him, then you have to prevent him.There is no medicine for this problem.

Spleen is like an organ that protects body from encapsulated organisms whose infection can cause deadly diseases and so its absence can lead to infection from such organisms. So, its usually advised to get vaccinated from those organisms.

Initially the pain was after back pain which felt very much like a kidney infection , though when tested i had no urine infection. Then the pain started in my front lower right side and was really painful- however i still today experience this level of pain but have just learnt to tolerate it. it is an almost constant dull ache which then has occasional sharp shooting stabbing pains. I had blood tests I went to an oseto to check i hadnt pulled a muscle, tried accupuncture and was told just to accept the pain. I pushed the doctors and now I have had my ovaries checked, one is slightly polycystic but nothing that should cause pain and had a laporoscopy to look for endometriosis (there is none). have had a colonoscopy and a barium follow through all are clear. obviously it is a relief that these are clear but frustrating as i do not know what is causing the pain. The doctor has now suggested another laporoscopy to look for adhesions on my intestine , but i fear this will again be inconclusive. Have you seen anything like this before and could it be cronic appendicitis?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for using this forum. As per your symptoms this can be due to various causes. However since you have got most of the diagnostic investigations done, this narrows down the etiology. Firstly this can be due to chronic appendicitis, which does tend to cause dull pain over time without giving clear diagnostic or investigative results. However since you already had diagnostic laparoscopy done, the condition of the appendix should have been noted in the first place. Another thing to look for is any lumps/swellings in the inguinal region, which means to say that there can be non revealing femoral hernia which can also be missed. You should get ultrasound checkup done regularly along with urine tests as these tests may vary. Kindly feel free to ask further.

Any suggestions for this? many thanks","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMI have gone through your question and understand your concerns but don't worry. The dry chapped lips, yellowish crust and painful gums in your child seems to be due to vitamin deficiency. Most likely it's due to riboflavin or vitamin C deficiency.So, I would recommend you to start him on vitamin B complex and vitamin c supplements. Foods rich in vitamin B 2 or riboflavin are: Beef liver., Lamb , Milk ,Natural yogurt, Mushrooms, Spinach, Almonds, Sun-dried tomatoes, etc. Vitamin c is present in citrus fruits.Hopefully this will help.Take care"},{"Patient":"My 10 year old daughter is complaining of pain in her left side just below her ribs.

The possible causes of the pain below the ribs could be acidity, stretch or strain or simple apprehension and anxiety. You do mention that the same symptom was present before so days and it went away after three hours. First of all motivate her that this is nothing. Then apply some mild pain killer gels and convince her that with this treatment the pain should vanish. Encourage her to divert her attention towards more entertaining and creative tasks.

But for a 2 years old kid, it's not at all sufficient to sustain only on cerelac baby food. Food fads develop in this age and unless and until you start offering her all your staple diet, she won't nourish well on just baby foods.Offer your child the same healthy foods that you and the rest of your family enjoy. Give your child foods with different flavours and textures from all 4 food groups. The 4 food groups are:-Vegetables and fruit-Grain products-Milk and alternatives-Meat and alternativesMake sure that the foods you offer are prepared with little or no added salt or sugar. Include healthy foods that are higher in fat like salmon, avocado, cheese, and nut butters.Hopefully this will help you.

Many a times, by omitting a variety of food items in child's diet due to fear of aches and bowel disturbances, we make them prone to malnutrition. Every child needs a proper balanced diet at this age in spite of allergies and diseases. It's not advisable to go for any special diet such as gluten free without prior diagnostic tests which includes TTG antibodies and duodenal biopsy if required.Gassy tummy and stomachache in your child may be due to peptic ulcer disease, enzyme deficiencies, food allergies, infections or worm infestation such as giardiasis. So, to treat it I would recommend you to visit a gastroenterologist for complete examination and evaluation. Also, give your child normal healthy meals which include carbohydrates, proteins, fats, minerals and vitamins. You may consult a dietitian for help.

It's perfectly normal for 3 weeks old newborn to startle and stutter at times in sleep. Babies start recognising mother at 1 month of age and smile clearly by 2-3 months of age also known as social smile. Since your baby is too young for that, it's perfectly fine.During breast feeding, the initial thin milk is good at quenching thirst of baby and hind I'll which comes later is important for satisfying appetite.

Her situation is a little different as they can not find any obstruction or tightening of tubes or kidney issues etc... But kidneys and tubes remain swollen. Could the face swelling be connected. Los she had a slightly lazy eye when little and remained ever so slightly now. When she was smaller she went through a whole heap of changes that scared me many times she had wired head twitches that continued for months. Tilted head to one side and still des that occasionally. Her ears Keats bothered her and till this day seem too. She will get my finger and push it in her ears as if to say its hurting or bothering me. Another thing that is unusual with her eyes is that you have the coloured part of eye and then the white, with hers you have the coloured part, then a really intensified solid white, then a section of grayish white.

This affected the face just a little and wonder could that have done something on the inside to disturb the ear canals etc or eyes tat she has puffiness with what looks like bruising in the end corners and in.","Doctor":"hi,iam trying to put things together for you.Lets start with the plagiocephaly ,thats a big word ,but it means face is asymetrical and all symptoms that you decribe of head tilt and lazy eye and ear infections all point to a condition described as ocular plagiocephaly with torticollis .They have the head tilted to one side and the nose canals are not equal.Her kidneys with hydronephrosis ,can very well cause face swelling .if the water from the body is not passed out .She needs evaluation by three specialists nephrologist,ENT and plastic surgeon and ophthalmologist .Finally it may be part of a syndrome .Best of luck"},{"Patient":"My 3 year old has recently had some bowel movements that smell like bleach. She doesn t have any discomfort or symptoms of and illness and he bowel movement appears normal. She has been in antibiotics every month for the past 4 months, but finished the last one 3 weeks ago. She also takes miralax daily for constipation. What could cause this smell?","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMI understand your concerns. It seems that the use of antibiotics and miralax for long duration has lead to the change in gut flora of your daughter. Don't worry. I would recommend you to start her on probiotics such as enterogermina to replenish her flora.Constipation in kids of this age is most likely due to lack of fibres and dehydration. So, enrich your child's diet with fibres and give her plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. This will help in relieving her constipation and regular use of Miralax.Also, avoid use of antibiotics as far as possible as most common infections are viral in this age group and requires only symptomatic treatment.Hopefully this will help you. I would be happy to help you in any further child health related questions.Take care"},{"Patient":"i have stomach cramps for like 6 days now, they go and come, somtimes dull and sometimes I have to curl to bear the pain.

They are red, with little whiteheads on them. He doesn t have any anywhere else, is eating normally and running around as normal. Any ideas? Thank you.","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMI have gone through your question. As per your description, it seems that your child has miliaria crystalline which occurs due to blocked sweat glands. It occurs more often by oils when applied during hot weather. No compelling reason to treat miliaria crystallina exists because this condition is asymptomatic and self-limited.The prevention and treatment of miliaria primarily consists of controlling heat and humidity so that sweating is not stimulated. Measures may involve treating a febrile illness; removing occlusive clothing; limiting activity; providing air conditioning; or, as a last resort, having the patient move to a cooler climate.Topical treatments that have been advocated involve lotions containing calamine, boric acid, or menthol; cool wet-to-dry compresses; frequent showering with soap.Hopefully this will help you. I will be happy to help you in any further child health related questions.Take care"},{"Patient":"my 10 year old son was diagnosed to be suffering from primary complex, he just started his medication yesterday per instruction of his doctor..my fear is whenever afternoon comes he has always fever..how long will such fever subside since he already started his medications?","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCM I completely understand your concerns but don't worry. Once you start the proper course for primary complex tuberculosis, symptoms including fever and anorexia improve within 10 days in most cases.In rare instances when the fever persists, then visit your doctor for re examination to rule out any pus collection and review of treatment.Hopefully this will help you. I would be glad to help you in any further questions.Take care"},{"Patient":"Our 7yearold daughter has feverish symptoms but with a large red bruise ( raised) in her neck which is itchy. The first day it was all red, today the center is skincolored and the ring around it is red. Another similar smaller bruise is forming on her back. She itches we thought it was dry skin but when she scratches somewhere, it bleeds easily. She has a headache and sore muscles and eyes and a temperature.","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCM I have gone through your question. It seems that your daughter had some insect bite or infection leading to the symptoms you mentioned. Insect bites such as spiders, ticks, ants etc can cause release of inflammatory mediators especially histamines which may lead to such skin lesion and systemic symptoms. It requires treatment with antihistamines such as Chlorpheniramine or Benadryl. Also, application of calamine lotion helps in prevention of local itching and early healing. For fever and body aches, acetaminophen or ibuprofen helps. In case the child doesn't respond to treatment, I would recommend a complete systemic examination to rule out any infection. Hopefully this will be helpful. I would be glad to help you in any further questions.Take care"},{"Patient":"my 5 yr old daughter has sores in one nostril crusty and yellowish, a cough not productive and an itchy anus keeoing us up at nite shes been treated with threadworm treatment 5 ml twice daily for 3 days to no avail what could it be or are these alll sympyoms of one thing","Doctor":"Hi.... Itchyanus could be due to thread worm infestation. But I do not relate the crusty nasal discharge and other symptoms your daughter is having for the same.

This is quite common in male children. This occurs due to accumulation of smegma beneath the skin and penile shaft. I suggest you see a paediatric surgeon for this. Usually the treatment will be corticosteroid cream and regular washing by retracting penile skin. This is not a major problem.

Swollen blood vessel in the ear could be a small capillary hemangioma, if it had been there since birth. But sudden appearance of swollen blood vessel anywhere in the body is not normal.

One is 2.5 and the other is 5 plus. Both have bad throats and a complete loss of appetite. Can you pls. help me with what I can give them to eat to overcome their weakness? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hi... by what you got I feel that both  your kids are having viral illness you can give them anything to eat. There are no food restrictions for viral illness like this. If there is temperature above 100 degrees Fahrenheit then you can give Paracetamol in the appropriate dose every 4th or 6th hourly.Bad throat could also be due to the same Viral pharyngitis.  But if fever and throat pain are predominant symptoms rather than cough then it could be bacterial infection also. To find this out the best office based test is to go ahead with Rapid antigen testing streptococcal infection. Then if it is positive they might require antibiotic treatment.I suggest you consult your pediatrician for this.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My 2 year old son has a bruised soft bump seems to be covering a hard bump on his lower mid spine and has had it for at least 2 months now.

The most likely reasons for the complaints of your daughter are musculoskeletal pain, lung or pleural infection or neurological pains. Don't worry as they can be easily managed once the diagnosis is established.I would recommend you to visit a paediatrician for complete examination. A chest x Ray will be useful to check the lung condition. Many a times pneumonias and lung abscess can lead to such presentation and can be picked up on chest x Rays.Antibiotics will be useful if a chest infection is found on evaluation.

How dangerous is that","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMI understand your concern but don't worry. Tylenol is safe even in twice the recommended dose if given once.

What could this be?","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMI have gone through your question and understand your concern. If the poops are negative for blood or RBC, the red colour on diaper can be due to urate crystals. Urate crystals in urine also give an appearance of bright orange or red similar to blood in diapers. This is a normal finding and is many a times indicator of dehydration.So, I would recommend you to give your baby regular feeds to keep him well hydrated. If the problem persists, get his urine and stools retested and send it for my reference.

The sounds are most probably the intestinal sounds,which are heard during movement,i.e.Peristalisis. It is a normal phenomenon. But,if you are having pain in that area,you have to go for an Ultrasound abdomen with the advice of your doctor.It will give a clue whether the pain is due to Appendicitis or Right side Ureteric stone.

Passing motion five to six times a day doesn't need any medication when not associated with any other symptoms like vomiting, refusal to feed, fever, lethargy, excessive crying etc Watch for signs of dehydration like dry skin, tongue, decreased amount of urine etc.Keep perianal area dry and clean to avoid rashes or exfoliation.

Kindly advice","Doctor":"Hi...As per your description this looks like a case of acute tonsillitis or upper airway infection associated with cervical lymphadenopathy which is recurrent innature. Increased wbc count is suggestive of underlying infection. As the child is playful otherwise and x ray chest is normal so lower respiratory tract seems normal. This kind of repeated tonsillar infection or upper airway infection  are common in pediatrics age group and it also leads to halitosis or foul breaths.

She said he had chest congestion, but also an ear infection. While she was checking out the ear, she was having trouble because my son would get cry and turn away, she also had to clean out the ear because I forgot to clean it out before the appointment, but his other ear was fine and clean. My son kept turning away while she was trying to clean out the inner ear canal, and also while she re-examined his ear. Long story short, that night I noticed dried up blood in his ear. My dad said it was normal after the doctor tried to clean it out, but as of today (Weds.) he still has dried up blood, and I ve been carefully cleaning out the dried up blood and little bit of wax that has been coming out.

Or should I take him back to the pediatrician ?","Doctor":"Hi... can you further describe the.findings? Does the child have ear discharge? Is there any history of.previous such complaints? Does the child accidentally insert any objects into the ear canal causing trauma? Most of the times pediatric age group patients do have earache and discharge along with cough cold suggestive of otitis media or inner ear infection.

The most common reason for fever in this age group is a self limiting viral illness. But since your child has high grade fever since last 3 days, it's important to rule out any bacterial infection as well. Antibiotics such as clamp kid forte should not be started before any proper evaluation.I see such cases regularly in my clinical practice and advice complete blood counts and urine examination (routine and culture). Chest X Ray and throat swab may be taken in case the child seems to have respiratory tract infection on clinical evaluation.

Is it possible to develop strep throat while taking augmentin?","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMI appreciate your observation and understand your concerns. But don't worry. It's very unlikely due to streptococcal infection because there are no symptoms and augmentin works well against strep infections. The fine red rash on abdomen can be due to an allergic reaction. It may occur due to drug allergy, food allergy or some allergens in his vicinity. In case it's troublesome, you may give him antihistamine such as Benadryl or Chlorpheniramine for relief.

Also, Gastro colic reflux can lead to frequent poops.I see such cases routinely in my clinical practice. I recommend probiotic such as enterogermina twice daily for the treatment of this condition. Probiotic will help in early recovery.Also, ensure regular healthy diet and plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. You may use lemonade, buttermilk, soups etc.Hopefully this will help you. I would be happy to help you in any further questions.Take care"},{"Patient":"I had to rush my 4 year old daughter yesterday to a doctor for stomachache, fever, vomiting and for some reason, she had swollen gums.. in the last 6 months, this has happened 3 times already, same symptoms except for the swollen gums. she was given different antibiotics, co-amoxiclav and ampicillin. blood test reveals an abnormal wbc count but normal urine test. they think it might be uti.","Doctor":"Hi...by what you quote I feel that it could be recurrent viral illness. Swelling of gums could be due to vitamin C deficiency or multivitamin deficiency. I will suggest you how a viral illness behaves so that you will be more confident next time - Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my baby is 8 months ols and he is teething, for the last 3 days he has a temperature between 38.5 and 39.8 degrees, I took him to the doc and he prescribed ponstan and an antibiotic with amoxillyn, baby cant seem to keep the antibiotic down , after just a few drops he has projectile vomiting emptying the contents of his tummy , does this mean that he is allergic to the amoxillyn ? i cant finish the course because of this","Doctor":"Thanks for asking Healthcaremagic.

These are most likely pin worms. The adult worms reside in the child's gut and after the female is fertilized, she emerges out of the anus at night to lay her eggs. This routine produces anal itching, which the child does to relieve his itch. The newly laid eggs then get stuck inside the child's nails. If he does not practice proper hand-washing, the eggs will be ingested with his next meal, and these eggs will give birth to new babies inside the child's gut.To treat pin worms, give a 3-day course of MEBENDAZOLE 100 mg twice a day after meals.

His hair seems to be falling out and has lost its curl in the past 2 weeks. He has autism, and is on a gluten, casein, soy, dye and artificial preservative-free diet... but has had several diet infractions this month. Could the infractions have anything to do with his hair health?","Doctor":"I am not sure why he is on so many dietary restrictions. If it is because of his autism, there is no proof that all these restrictions work. I feel that the restricted diet is more likely to have affected his hair health rather than the infractions!Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"Hi, My son is 11 and is experiencing what I call head spasms he has had them for many years, but they have been seldom. They are occurring more frequently. Our Dr. just sent my son for an MRI. I was just wondering if you have seen this before and what it might be? thanks Stacy","Doctor":"Please stay with the doctor and await the MRI results. At the same time, there are rarer causes of such head spasms which need to be considered. Some of them are due to metabolic errors. An example is Wilson's disease, which is an error of copper metabolism. Please suggest this to his doctor if the MRI is normal or not going anywhere.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"my 11 year old son had a nuclear renal scan with lasix done and results came back saying he has left pelviectasis. they have ordered a VCUG but not for another 3 weeks and then a follow up with urologist 3 weeks after that. What is this diagnosis and what is the treatment? Is it ok to wait so long for foloow up?","Doctor":"I need to know the reason why he had the initial tests - unless you tell me that, I cannot suggest if waiting for 3-6 weeks will be all right or not. Pelviectasis is nothing but a slight enlargement of the collecting system of the kidney (the portion inside the kidney that collects the urine from where it is formed in the other part of the kidney known as the renal parenchyma). It implies the presence of some obstruction to the channel beyond the pelvis of the kidney. This can be a structural block like a narrowed ureter, or a spasm of the ureter muscle either along its length or where it meets the bladder at the lower end.

Stay with him, give him plenty of water with electrolytes, rest, and light, easy to digest food. For the pain, you will need to give him paracetamol syrup, 5-6 ml per dose, up to 3-4 times per day as needed by him.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"Mt daughter is 1 year and 5 months old suffering from runny nose and fever(started today) doctor gave some medicine that is included Lorinase syrup but when I went through the leave left it is mentioned that below two years of age should not be given. please advise me in this regard.","Doctor":"Hi...Lorinase (depending on the country of availability) will contain Loratidine and/or Pseudoephedrine. Both these drugs are not recommended at this age group. But you need not worry as of now. Sometimes Pseudoephedrine can cause increased heart rat3ed and SVT (Supraventricular Tachycardia).

This is one viral illness among all other exanthemas which can cause fever followed by rash over palms and soles. It is a self-limiting disorder and itching can be really worrisome. I suggest you use any over the counter antihistamine if you have one with you now. You can use Hydroxyzine at 1-2mg/kg/dose (Maximum 10mg) every 6th to 8th hourly for 7 days. This can even cause some peeling of skin in the next 4-6 weeks and do not worry about it.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My 2-1/2 year old son has barely eaten the last few days and has loose clay colored or pale yellowish stools that are very foul fishy smelling. He threw up one morning, was fine the next, and then threw up again the third day. Any idea on what could be the cause?","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.It seems your kid is having viral diarrhoea. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

What should i do","Doctor":"HiCan you please elaborate the symptoms.Is the cough associated with cold or breathlessness? Is there any family history of similar complaints? Is there any exposure to allergens or pollen? The accentuated bronchovascular markings on the x ray chest can be because of repeated lower respiratory tract infections. You should visit a pediatrician for detailed evaluation as we need to rule out whether if it is cough variant asthma or if there is any evidence of lower respiratory tract infection like tuberculosis or any cardiac involvement."},{"Patient":"my 6 year old daughter has tested positive for strep twice now and is on her 2nd round of antibiotics, she has complained of severe abdominal pain and is now having nosebleeds. She had been complaining of the abdominal pain before this 2nd round of antibiotics, but now has the nosebleeds. At the start of this she had sudden onset of abd. pain, with fever , vomiting, grey skin color, heart rate was in the 160 s. We went to the ER for this and she was started on the 2nd antibiotic there through IV, and responded well to this. I am still confused over the abdominal pain and nosebleeds.","Doctor":"Hi.... Can you describe the complaints in details? Does the child have history of nose picking? Is there underlying coryza like symptoms? Nose bleed can most commonly be due to nose picking or can be a manifestation of underlying bleeding disorders. As it is associated with the abdominal pain and fever we should also think about infective etiologies like dengue where the patient has high grade fever, rash , epistaxis, abdo pain can be associated. Other possibility is that this nose bleeding may be different from abdominal pain. I think the child will need few investigation such as hemogram to look for platelet count and bleeding and clotting time. Also please let me know how is the abdominal pain and fever at present?"},{"Patient":"My son is 2 1/2 years old. He had a high fever for 3 days, highest being 103.3. No other symptoms.

He has on long sleeve pajamas a sheet and comforter and the house is 72 degrees. This seems strange to me. Is this okay or do I need to have him looked at again?","Doctor":"Hi, I would like to know few details. Is the fever associated with cough, cold? Is there loose motion or vomiting? Is there cry during passing urine? If there are no symptoms then it is fever without focus. We may need to investigate the child to find the focus of the fever if the child is sick looking and toxic. If the child is playful we can wait for 48-72 hours for the fever to subside and can use antipyretic and tepid sponging as needed."},{"Patient":"19 month old started with fever around 101 yesterday also noted red rash on bottom, thought was diaper rash, and in crevices of knees and elbows.

Did it occur before or after fever ? Is there history of repeated episodes?Has the.child completed immunization as per date? This presentation can be due to viral exanthem.

An active is a well kid even if she/ he is not eating well. 2. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone.3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day.4. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.5.

My Daughter is currently four months old. Ever since she was born we ve had problems being able to feed her. She has been diagnosed with nipple aversion, and GERD. ThiI ve also s past week, though, the child protective services have decided to put her into custody, because they cannot understand as to why she cannot/will not be able to gain weight. I have had to take her to the hospital four previous times (including one visit where she had a Mic-Key button to be surgically inserted into her belly). I ve also taken her to Kansas City for a second opinion before the surgery. I am just wondering why, even with the doctors instructions and help, why she can only take about half of what she would typically be able to take for her age. I would like some extra advice/opinions about this. I hope that I can get some extra help for her condition, and so I can put some extra insight to the CPS workers.","Doctor":"From your history, it seems that the decision of the authorities to place her in the custody of CPS is incorrect and that there is no neglect from your side. While I appreciate your point of view, the reason for their decision might not be that they think you are neglecting your daughter, but that they feel that you are not competent to help her. There is a difference in this. In the second case, they are not blaming you but want the best possible outcome for your daughter, health-wise. It is possible that she has some underlying disorder that they have still not discovered. You need to be patient with them, and with her doctors. Continue to take interest in what is happening to her, and request them to dig deeper to find out what is wrong rather than harping on your incompetence or neglect - even if those are valid accusations. Your continued involvement without seeming to be obsessed with her custody will eventually pave the way for your daughter to return to you after her diagnosis and treatment have been accomplished.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"My granddaughter who came to live with me 2 months ago, is having a hard time listening and following directions.

The first two weeks she did great and then switched teachers. Who knows.","Doctor":"I agree with the final two words of the question. In some cases, the problem is too complex to be discovered so soon. You should be patient with your granddaughter (G.D.). Rather than being a disciplinarian, which is not always a bad thing, you should try and be close to her and show her your concern and understanding. That approach will more easily make her accept you and perhaps confide in you. Grounding her every time will make her more and more rebellious, and maybe provoke her to do something that you will regret for ever.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"my daughter is almost 7 and she has had a stuffy nose and headaches for the last couple of days.

Please consult a psychologist first, and on their recommendation, a psychiatrist, before going in for contrast study as recommended by your pediatrician.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"my 14 year old son had started having stomach pains on the right side so we went to the er and they did blood, urine and ct scan test with contrast. they ruled out appendicitis and kidney stones and said it was a viral infection and sent him home. the next day the radioligy department called me and asked how he was doing and said he needs to follow up with his family doctor immediately because the radioligist looked at his results and he found that he has fluid in the upper right quadrant. i was wondering what this could be caused from?","Doctor":"Dear friend, welcome and thanks for entrusting your query here at HCM! I am Dr. Prasad Akole (Critical Care Expert-  and am glad to address to your query here. Free fluid in the abdomen if more than minimal can be significant. Was it free fluid or fluid within the bowel or gall bladder? Your description does not clarify it. Fluid may collect from various causes- infective, perforation/ rupture of an organ like gall bladder/ bowel, or generalized disorder like low proteins or liver disease etc. You need an actual in person examination by a physician to differentiate it. So, yes the radiologist rightly asked you to see your doctor again. Pl. keep me posted on what happens. I hope you are fully satisfied with the guidance I gave. I would be glad to answer any further queries. May I request you to rate your experience here before you close. Thank you and Good luck!"},{"Patient":"hello there. I m here to ask for help. my daughter has been acting weird. she doesn t want to eat or drink anything but water. she will always cry in the night, and she will want me to hold her to sleep, but today she was sleeping, and all of a sudden. she was crying nonstop and I looked at her mouth it was bleeding. so I call my sister to get me orajel and squeeze alittle to my index finger n massage the medicine on her top gums and I took out my index it was bleeding a lot. I got scare and I want to know what s going on.but she went to sleep already. but what is causing it","Doctor":"You should open her mouth and examine it under a strong flashlight to figure out what caused the bleeding. It could be dental, gums, tongue, floor of the mouth, tonsils, roof of the mouth. There could be a cut, ulcers, or other problems. Look for redness, swelling and oozing from the site. If nothing is found, it might be best to go to an oral surgeon to discover the cause of the bleeding. You could do it after she is awake and about. Please mention the age of your daughter in your next follow-up question so that we can help you better.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"sir,my son age is 8 month.he has convultion with jerk & sometime fit with eye fixed. mri report say-right hippocampal sclerosis.eeg report-bi temporo-occipital epileptiform with frequent spreat to become generalised epileptiform activity.medicine use-epival&lobazam5.but convultion continue.....is it can curable,is my son led normal life,is it harm devolpment of my child","Doctor":"When repeated fits damage the hippocampus, the outcome is unlikely to be normal, ever. He may continue to get fits all his life, or for many, many years. This condition, however, can be treated with stereotactic surgery, where a neurosurgeon will go into your son's brain under controlled conditions and remove the sclerotic hippocampus. This surgery can even stop his fits. However, this is a major kind of surgery, with attendant risks. You should research this both online and offline. See a good neurosurgeon in a large city and consult them for the pros and cons. Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"Hi, I m a mother of an 11 months old girl.

You should give paracetamol for fever and continue to give her the vomiting medicine before her food three times a day. If this is a virus, it will settle in a few days.

Her diet has been very limited to fruit & yoghurt but has improved over the past few days. Blood & urine tests done a couple of weeks ago revealed urinary infection & thyroid levels at the lower end of normal. I have only just found out about the urine infection, so she started AB s yesterday. She has always had a mushy looking stool but as of yesterday it became runnier & today it s watery & sort of bright yellow. Is the change in her bowel movements due to the infection or her diet? What are some of the symptoms of a urine infection? She hasn t appeared unwell besides the poor appetite. Should she normally have a firm stool?","Doctor":"Too many queries ... but I will try to answer them all in brief. Urinary tract infection causes high fever with chills, pain in the stomach, vomiting, pain while passing urine, loss of appetite and sickness out of proportion to the visible signs of infection. The loose stools may be due to the antibiotic that you are using - which one is it?Normally, yes, all children should have a formed stool, which may not necessarily be firm, but it should not be runny either.Please continue to give her an appropriate antibiotic so that she improves generally. That is the only way to restore her appetite.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"My 11 year old son observed blood in dribbles after urinating. The blood was observed on tissue paper while wiping. One time was bright red drop, then next time bright red stringy, fiber like, then another time dark, rust colored blood droplet, liquid, on the tissue. The urine test in the Dr office detected high white blood cell count but the culture found no blood in urine nor bacteria. What could be the cause of this and should there be further testing?","Doctor":"The culture might have been an erroneous one, but the more likely thing is that the blood is due to sterile inflammation of the urinary bladder or the presence of gravel or small stones in the bladder. You should repeat the urine test, as well as take him for a radiograph and a kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) ultrasound to rule out non-infective causes of bleeding such as a stone or presence of gravel.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"Hello, I am Ganesh from Hyderabad, India.

I didn t give him any dosage thats due now. I will have to wait till evening to consult the pead again.","Doctor":"Dear Ganesh,The rash is most likely due to the antibiotic and points to the entire illness being due to a virus that is called as \\"infectious mononucleosis\\" virus or the EBV.

I am really sorry, but the shunt surgery is extremely needed at this point to prevent further damage to the brain. As to her future outcome, no one can say, because over time, TB of the brain can be followed by a lot of improvement; or, the child may remain bed-ridden for a long time. Please be courageous and do not delay the shunt surgery any longer.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"My son was recenlty admitted to hospital (aged 18 months) following weeks of what was suspected back to back viruses after starting childcare.  Blood cultures, urine and stool results were all negative - the only abnormalities were a raised ALP (around 1800) and raised CRP (around 50).  The paediatrician said that the raised ALP wasn't significant in isolation as it wasn't associated with other abnormal results - what would cause this marked rise? Thanks","Doctor":"What your pediatrician told you is correct. A raised alkaline phosphatase in the absence of other parameters like altered calcium and phosphorus levels in the blood do not imply anything. ALP is raised with rickets and other bone disorders, but if your son never had anything of that sort, stop worrying. The raised CRP only indicates an infection or inflammation in the body and has no long-term significance. Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"Hello, I ve been experiencing a pain in my lower abdominal area.

I have not experienced nausea , but I do feel like I have a little bit of a flue.","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. The most common reason of such pain is urinary tract infection. Frequent urinating and burning while urinating can appear. Some other possible reasons are diverticulitis (left lower abdominal area), ovarian cyst, uterine infection.

In this period, should Asthalin or Actifed be given .Please advise","Doctor":"It depends on what kind of cough your son has. If there is wheezing and it is an allergic cough, Asthalin might be better. If it is an irritatory cough with dry mouth and no phlegm, asthalin will not function. In such a case, Actifed D will be a better choice."},{"Patient":"My daughter is 6 years old and has been running a high temp for 3 day. So far the highest was 104.1.

I live in New Jersey and heard on the news that some kids came down with whooping cough so I am covering my basis.","Doctor":"These are all symptoms of a flu-like illness, rather than whooping cough. The reason I am saying this is that you have probably given her the vaccine against whooping cough; secondly, you do not describe any whoop following her cough; thirdly, her cough is not occurring in long bouts; fourthly, stomach ache and headache are normally not a part of whooping cough unless the cough is very severe in nature.Continue giving her treatment for fever. Advil should work against the pains as well.

The simple answer is no. As to whether she might be allergic to some food or formula ingredient - I cannot say yes or no with confidence. You can try eliminating one food after another and see if the rash goes away. The only other way is a hi-tech method to check the blood for antibodies of the IgE class to different foods. I would not recommend this at present, but if the problem does not go away for, say, 2-3 months, you can approach her pediatrician for advice on allergy testing. First, though, you need to confirm that this is an allergic rash, because it might well be just a viral rash!Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"my child has had diarohea and vomiting. he has recovered from it but it has left him with a stomach ache, high temperature and smelly wind. he has seen the GP and Gp checked child stomach and said everything is fine. but my child is still complaining with the same symptoms and it has now been 11 days for him to have the symptoms. Hes not eating well at all the drinking is fine. He is a slim child but now i can see his ribs which concerns me the most now. please advice me in what i should now.","Doctor":"Dear friend,You should get his stool sample examined by a recognised, registered laboratory to rule out amoebic infection or giardiasis. Both these are parasites of the human gut and can cause a chronic problem without there being many loose bowels. Other than that, I would not suggest anything. If you think he is slimmer now than before, you need to give him energy-rich foods as much as he can tolerate them. This would mean sugary stuff and fats/oils. However, a balanced normal diet is a better alternative than concentrating on specific foods. As he recovers, he will gain weight. Do keep his weight AND height record, taking these measurements at least once a fortnight.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"my 8 year old has had a cold now since before Christmas. No fever, just congestion, cough. Last night she told me her left ear was hurting and suddenly she was able to hear herself very loudly out of that one. This morning there is no pain just same difference in level of hearing.","Doctor":"Dear friend,The ear on that side is probably blocked from within by what is called a serous otitis media. The spelling is \\"serous\\", not \\"serious\\". It means that the ear gets inflammed with watery liquid filling up the middle ear, the reason being the earlier cold that she had. This normally resolves on its own as the cold resolves, so no treatment may be needed. However, if the problem does not subside within a week, take her to the ENT doctor."},{"Patient":"my son is tube fed, this past week he had an ear infection so doctor put him on antibotics, his but got very sore (diaper rash) soon as the 10 days was done of antibotics his rash went away, but now im noticing a red dry feeling circle around his tube, should i take him to be seen or just continue to put some oniment on it?","Doctor":"I didn't clearly understand what you meant. Do you mean there is a red circle around where his feeding tube is, or do you mean there is a red circle around his anus? If it is the feeding tube, then it needs to be checked, and perhaps changed, by a registered trained nurse or doctor. If, however, the redness is around his anus, you can apply an anti-fungal cream on it for a week before worrying about it."},{"Patient":"My 12 year old daughter is complaining of a cold sensation on one side of her face. This happened before about a month ago, but went away quickly. Now the cold sensation has returned and is bothering her to the point of distraction. I have called for an appointment, but wonder what this could be.","Doctor":"Dear friend,It might be something related to the nerve that supplies sensation on the face - viz. the trigeminal nerve or what we commonly know as the fifth cranial nerve. She will need to be seen by a pediatrician urgently. The other possibility is that she may be having gum or dental trouble ... so please take a look inside her mouth.

I gave her tylenol for the fever and bathe her to bring the fever down. This morning she has chills. She was recently taken to the doctor last week for cough no fever. She was prescribed cough medicine and amoxicillin.","Doctor":"Giving an infant a bath to reduce the temperature rarely has a lasting effect. It might be a better idea to sponge the child continuously with luke-warm water, till the core temperature comes back to normal, or at least subsides to a safe level. To check if the core temp. has decreased, just check the warmth inside the child's mouth. The chills are probably related to the underlying cause of the fever. You need to show her to the pediatrician as soon as possible.Dr Taher"},{"Patient":"My son is 22 months and has had diarrhea for two weeks now. Currently, I change 15-20 diapers a day. His stool ranges from liquid to super soft. He also has been having a lot of mucos in the stool. I ve also noticed tiny, soft gel looking like pellets in his stool. In addition, when his stool is on the soft side versus running, it is brownish, reddish.","Doctor":"You need to describe what treatment he is getting for his diarrhoea. Unless you tell us that, it would be impossible to guide you. I would say that he has probably acquired a secondary bacterial infection after his original virus went away. He will need antibiotics specially meant for gut infections. A visit to his pediatrician and a stool examination in a lab are the right way to go. Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"My daughter is 31 mos and has always been the gassy child persay. At times we are very concerned about the bloating and bulge. She would rather drink than eat. Her stomach gets very large and firm to the touch. She is the child that gets sick very easily and goes rounds with bronchialitis. We have discussed this with her pediatrician a few times and did xrays but nothing further. Should we push for a specialist. She is just a little peanut and I don t want to miss something if there is an issue. Thank You Rebecca Z.","Doctor":"All the symptoms you describe are not an unusual combination for the child. While the gassiness and bloating may all be due to what is commonly called \\"lactose intolerance\\", repeated attacks of bronchiolitis are not related to the abdominal problems in any way. Please get a stool tested for lactose intolerance. If this is discovered, she will need lactose-free formula and lactose-free dairy products. This will help her reduce the stomach bloating and gassiness and enable her to put on weight. This, in turn, may improve her immunity sufficiently to protect herself against repeated attacks of respiratory illnesses.

She is absolutely fine, as far as I can judge. While it is mentioned in books that children triple their birth weight by 1 year, this is not a hard and fast rule. It also depends on the genes she has inherited. For example, either you or your spouse may have been like this at 1 year of age! And the child is following in your/their footsteps!Doing 4 stools every day is normal for her, so don't worry about this. A change in stool pattern is abnormal. Otherwise, every child has a different routine for stooling.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"Hi I would like to enquire regarding babys milk. My son is now 15 months old.

He used to take 8 ounces of formula milk. How many ounces of nestle tetra pakc should i give him.","Doctor":"Yes, it is absolutely fine to continue with Nestle milk. No dilution is needed. Let the child decide the quantity. Feeding him with a feeder or a cup or glass is the right way, as it will give him the independence to decide how much he wants. Stop his bottle, as bottle-feeding is generally fraught with higher risk of infective diarrhoea in India and other developing countries. Further, continuing with bottle feeds will discourage him from changing to a full family diet, which is where he should be from the age of one year.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"I am an O.T. working with a 2year old girl dx with VACTERL...can you tell me what the eye problems are with this...I am wondering if she has some visual/ perceptual challenges as she is unable to place single puzzle pieces correctly...are there peripheral field deficits or convergence problems?","Doctor":"There are no specific described eye problems. Her vision will depend on the integrity of her eye structure. Hence, that should be checked out first. Does she have, for example, a cataract, or a retinal problem?Structure problems lead to function problems. Remember that! Of course, sometimes, especially when it comes to the brain and eye, the structure may be totally normal.

Normally, this condition is completely harmless. However, when a child with this problem ingests certain medicines or foods, the lack of the enzyme on his red blood cells causes the cells to burst open and cause anemia and jaundice. With such an episode, he may need to be hospitalised, and even given blood if too much of the red cells have got destroyed. The complete list of drugs can be searched for on the net. Just type \\"Drugs to avoid in patient with G6PD deficiency\\". Download that list, print it out and display it prominently above his crib. Whenever you take him to a doctor, carry a copy of the list so that he does not unwittingly prescribe one of those drugs. Other than these few issues, your son will have a normal life.

And when she sleeps it seems as if she can never breath right. Im not sure if this is ok or if I should worry and take her in.","Doctor":"There could be several reasons for seeing dry blood in her nose. It could be a small nosebleed, for which the commonest cause is nose-picking in older children, and bleeding from the small veins in the front part of the nose in smaller kids, for no apparent reason. The sleep difficulty may also be related to the above problem. Both together may be due to a sinus problem affecting the maxillary sinuses.

If they do not go within a few days, please get his CBC (a full hemogram) done to see what his platelet counts are.

The best way to get to know about the pregnancy is to perform pregnancy test. Some of tests are able to diagnose pregnancy in 7 days after fertilization.

Now she has lumps under both lower jaws, a red swollen upper gum, bad breath, drooling and poor appetite. She received her MMR shots a week and a half ago. No more fever. What is she going through?","Doctor":"The entire symptom complex suggests presence of infection in her mouth, more specifically, her gums (gingivitis). The lumps under her jaws are lymph glands, and they will subside once she is given antibiotics. Even her bad breath, gum swelling and poor appetite will go down. Please make sure she gets either penicillin tablets/syrup or metronidazole syrup to cover for certain common germs that cause oral and gum infections.I think she should improve in less than a week. The fever is unlikely to be related to the MMR vaccine, although the time-frame is certainly right.

We took temp it was 101.3 gave advil didn t go down for a while. Woke up Monday morning seems okay.","Doctor":"Dear friend,This is a highly unusual symptom in a five-year old child. I mean the blood on her panties, unless she hurt herself there while playing. Do take a look at her private parts, both the front and the back under a good flashlight illumination. If in any doubt, take her to her pediatrician. There does not seem to be any relation between the blood on her panties and the occurrence of fever. The latter seems to have subsided anyway, but still, you should get her looked at by a pediatrician.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"My son was diagnosed with Chiari 1 malformation and fatty filum. His neurosurgeon says he needs surgery and soon..his pediatrician and neurologist say he doesn t have tethered cord and doesn t need surgery. Now he has choking/clearning his throat. Should he have surgery and is the choking/clearing of the throat related to the Chiari?","Doctor":"I am not totally qualified to answer this, but I  think the problem in the back of his spine and lower brain is likely to cause dysfunction of the lower cranial nerves and thereby, affect swallowing, the gag reflex, vocalisation, tongue movements, etc. So, the probable answer is: yes, but I strongly recommend taking him back to his neurosurgeon first and seek a professional opinion, rather than sitting at home or consulting other professionals who are not trained at recognising such issues.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"1 yo daughter had older sister die from leukemia (high risk due to LiFraumeni). Child has fallen in growth chart to less than 15% in height and weight since 3 months. Constant watery/sandy stools-never solid stool. Now is seeing PT for low muscle tone and weak core/hips. She scoots on her bottom, doesn t crawl. Just learned to roll over back to front. Concerns of mine are in labs-Normal WBC 12.6 with 19%Segs, 71%Lymph, 5%Mono, 4%Eos, 1%Bands. 33.8 HCT, 11.4 HGB, 33.7 MCHC. Also 92 glucose, 4 BUN, 0.23 Creatinine, 146 Triglycerides, 4.2 albumin, 2.2 globulin, 1.9A:G, 1.11 Free T4. Obviously concerns abound. Doc now referring us to Neurology (not sure why-waiting on call from him). I assume we are focusing on muscle issues, but don t want to overlook GI issues and lose sight of the fact that we have a genuine concern about what we ve endured before. BTW-DD1 wasn t diagnosed with usual ALL symptoms. She went into ER for Hip pain that caused her to not be able to walk. It resolved in 2 days but returned in other hip a week later. 1 lab with a couple blasts (normal WBC, RBC, DIFF, etc), prompted doc to order a consult with hematology, dx 3 weeks later with high risk pre b-cell ALL. she died 1 year later after GvHD battle.","Doctor":"Dear friend,First of all, accept my condolences on the loss of your first daughter.Coming to your current question, nothing in her symptoms or investigations seems to point to ALL as of now. If your concern is with 71% lymphocytes, this can be normal in a year old infant. Her other cell counts and biochemistry tests are normal. As to whether she could be having a musculo-skeletal disorder, I am not currently knowledgeable enough to comment on what it might be, but I would suggest that if they want to get this diagnosis out of contention, they should consider a MITOCHONDRIAL disorder. I say this because both your children with illnesses were/are daughters, and mitochondrial myopathies are all inherited down the maternal line only to daughters.Do revert if the tests turn up anything.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"My 11 yr old daughter has Chiari 1 malformation and I have seen that canniboid oil has been helping kids with other conditions, my question is has there been any legitimate studies that show if it can help with the pain , insomnia and nausea that are the result of having Chiari and nerve damage ?","Doctor":"Dear friend,I did some basic research and discovered that there are only anecdotal studies on the various benefits of oil extracted from the marijuana plant but hardly any hard-core scientific data. The material on the net shows only relief with inflammatory conditions and some types of cancer. In your child's case, neither of these situations apply. Rather, the symptoms of pain and insomnia are probably due to compression of nerve roots as they exit the brain. Hence, in my humble opinion, I doubt if the cannaBINOID oils can do much for the Chiari 1 malformation.It might still be possible for you to try it if any recognised institute is planning to conduct trials on this kind of treatment. Your child can then join such a trial after completing the requirements for joining it.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"yes I have a 14 year old grandson he has some type of personality disorder he withdraws from school he lost interest in a lot of things he use to love he acts as if everybody is out to get him he is easily irritated and aggaviated he is very talkative until it makes him overtired he is always complaining about yall when I ask him who is yall he has no reply..

You should get her investigated for an immunological problem. One of the most common among these problems is common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), which can be easily managed with gamma-globulin infections and a few other interventions.If her immune functions are normal, you can still try some things like greater attention to hand-washing, giving her multivitamins and a protein-rich diet, avoiding going to crowded places, avoiding a creche or a day-nursery where she is in constant touch with other, better-abled children, and so on.

He has several accidents now. His physical activity is great and he is highly functioning but this started to be a problem. How can I help him?","Doctor":"Temporarily, it will help to make him go to the potty every 6 hours in the day-time and wait for at least 5-10 minutes, making every effort to evacuate. If he does not agree or comply with this, you should start putting disposable underwear or nappies so as to prevent soiling and similar accidents. The correct treatment will be to first relieve his constipation with laxatives and/or purgatives. Even enema is a better idea than doing nothing. Once the problem of stooling and soiling is solved, you should go ahead and take him for counselling and behavioural therapy.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"This past week i ve had bad diarrhea and went to the hospital saturday and got tests done and an xray because of bad stomach pains but they said it was just a virus but tonight when i went to the bathroom i had a pinkish color on the toilet paper when i wiped. So i took a pregnancy test but it came out negative, should i have waited to take it or is it right? i m just so confused because when i looked it all up it says pregnancy but the test came out negative.","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. Pinkish color on the toilet paper can be caused by intestine invagination (intussusception). It causes strong abdominal which can suddenly disappear if the intestine comes back to regular state. Sometimes it is very hard to diagnose it. Abdominal ultrasound during the pain should visualize it. Viral intestinal infection is also possible especially if your pain wont happen again. However if your symptoms will come back again, diagnostics should be done including abdominal ultrasound, colonoscopy, full blood work. Hope this will help.

However doctor asked the symtoms and confirmed that she is suffering with allergic bronchitis. Could you please let me know whether this is curable completely or she needs to suffer with this for ever ?","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for asking Healthcare Magic. Allergic bronchitis is caused by a specific allergen. This particular condition is triggered by an overly active immune system that attacks harmless foreign substances that enters the body. The immune system identifies the foreign substance as dangerous and releases antibodies to fight the substance. Allergic bronchitis can effectively be treated by having the right information about the disease and also being informed on what kind of allergen is causing the irritation. You can go for a series of test of the particular allergens that causes the irritation. Normally, prevention of allergic bronchitis will include staying away from the allergens that causes the condition. You have to consider that allergic bronchitis may worsen during the summer months as there will be a lot of allergens available.By carefully managing allergic bronchitis, your daughter will be able to live a normal and productive life.

They said however that when he went through puberty (which he is going through now) that the chiari may not become a problem. He is currently not on any medications. Any ideas?","Doctor":"You need to check his pulse - is it strong and regular, or are there missed beats. Also, his BP should be measured when he is upright and when he is on the bed. Numerous conditions can cause dizziness, but the most relevant ones are rhythm disturbances of the heart, a high blood pressure, migraine, heat-related dizziness, dehydration and, in his case, because he has a brain-vertebral column malformation, circulatory problems in the blood vessels around his lower brain. He needs a proper evaluation by a good physician, and perhaps, tests to determine if any of the above problems are present.Rarely, problems with the balancing organ of the inner ear may also cause these symptoms. If he has any ear problem history, please take him to ENT as well.Hope this helps without scaring you ... I am sure he will turn out to have a minor issue, most likely migraine.

We could also rule out nephritic colic. The colicky abdominal pain could be due to transient disorder or serious diseases. This could be caused by distension, obstruction or inflammation. Most frequently the cause is benign and/or self-limiting, but more serious causes may require urgent intervention. You might require to see a doctor so he can determine the cause and make sure it is not a serious diseases. You could take antispasmodic medication and sodium bicarbonate salt to start with and see if the pain subsides permanently.

The doctor is responsible because he cannot withstand your pressurising him to prescribe strong drugs. Be aware of this trap. As you said, you are also using Ascoril in addition to the antibiotic. Why ascoril? Does she have more than a simple cough and cold? Is there fast breathing? Phlegm (productive cough)? If those problems are present, then she can keep getting this problem every month or even more frequently.You should go back to the doctor and request him to do tests on your daughter to understand the problem better. They should consider referring you to a senior pediatrician, a pediatric chest physician or an allergologist.I hope this helps.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"Hi, i have a daughter she is 2&6 years old. when ever she eats lentin or beans she feels pain in her leg and she keeps crying at night. I asked some relatives and they told me my daughter probably has G6PD. If that is true what is the cure for that?","Doctor":"G6PD problem leads to other issues like anemia and jaundice after eating fava beans - that too only in some cases. Eating other lentils does not cause any problems in G6PD child. The leg pains are definitely not due to G6PD. As to what they are due to ... you will need to see a doctor and run some tests on her, including blood calcium and phosphate, blood counts and X rays if indicated by the doctor. Treatment will depend on what the cause is. Some children get leg pains due to no other reason than the fact that they get tired after running around the whole day. These are often referred to as growing pains. They need no specific treatment other than iron supplements in the form of iron syrups.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"HELLO DOC WILL MY BABY IS 1 MONTH OLD AND HE IS NOT TAKING PROPER BREASTFEEDING SO WE HAVE TO OPT FOR LACTOGEN 1 , SO CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME THAT IT IS SAFE TO GOING FOR LACTOGEN AS HE IS ONLY 1 MONTH OLD AND I AM WORRIED THAT HE NOT TAKING MY FEED.PLEASE REPLY THANKS","Doctor":"His not taking breastfeeds could be because he is unwell, or he is unable to latch on to your breast properly. If he is well, check if your nipples are of the right size for him to latch on to correctly. Offer him the full breast and not just the nipple and let him grasp your areola along with the nipple inside his mouth. This will help him to suckle better and avoid the need for Lactogen 1. If at all you have to give Lactogen 1, give it with a spoon and cup and not with a bottle as this will confuse him and he will soon stop breastfeeding altogether.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"Hello Dr, My baby got infected with bronchitis at age of 9. he was dehydrated and was hospitalized, Dr started antiboitic along with nebulization with medicine ventolin, clenil and aterment/atem . may be got better in a week and after 2 to 3 week nebulization process he was 100% well but as he is turn 11 he got infected again with, dr said its same sort of illness with some effect of pneumonia ( may be bronchiolitis ) this time, may be stopped taking milk , it was very difficult for us to handle, as we were worried of dehydration. then we use Salinase drop and he started taking diet. What i wanted to know, is it normal to get infected with such issues like we do with flu , cough etc? or getting infected again and again is an issue ? its not easy to find baby breathing very difficulty so i am very worried, please advice, what we can do avoid such thing later, do formula milk cause this. also dr this time started piriton syrup. THanks","Doctor":"It appears that your baby is 11 months old and not 11 years old. If this is correct, attacks of bronchiolitis are due to virus known as RSV and this can happen recurrently and even lead to childhood asthma. You should follow your doctor's advice and use nebulisation as often as needed to stop his breathing problems. No one really knows whether food or milk can contribute to the problem as the major cause is the RSV virus and not milk. Do not change his milk unless you have had your son tested for milk protein allergy.

With all possibilities, you had a regurgitation of your stomach contents into your mouth both due to exhaustion and anxiety. If I were your doctor, I would advise you to avoid food from outside, and go for a proton pump inhibitor along with a prokinetic agent and a probiotic for a short duration on consultation with your family physician.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I am quite sure this was not something done by an accredited doctor. You should consider going to any of the big cities in India, but I think Chennai or Hyderabad may be relatively easier on your budget than Mumbai or Delhi. Bangalore is another good option. You should visit a paediatric Orthopedic surgeon, and you will find one in any large corporate hospital. Wockhardt/Fortis has a large orthopaedic center in Mumbai, for example. They would be able to guide you further, if you can afford private hospitals.If you wish to go to a public hospital, then that is fine too.

Is there any element of coercion in making him eat his food? Are either of you among the parents forcing him to eat food against his wish? If you are, then that is the cause of his symptoms and not some gastric illness.I don't think this problem is at all related to the school event that you described, or to the use of antibiotics.

You may want to hold on for a few days at the most. If there is fever, a yellow phlegm or rapid breathing, holding on even for a few days is dangerous. A night-time or early morning cough, any pus emanating from one or both ears, pain behind the ear in the bone above the jaw, swelling of the neck glands and difficulty in swallowing should all prompt you to seek help sooner. Antibiotics themselves are not the culprit. Self-administering them, giving them in the wrong way or in the wrong dose, or using the wrong antibiotic, or using them for the wrong duration - those are the culprits.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"Hai Doctor,I am Dhivya .I have two daughters,elder one is of dusky colour and the younger one is quite fair.So i need ur guidance to improve the colour of the elder one and she is 9 1/2 years old now, she herself  has inferiority complex ,should i use some  fairness creams from now onwards  or should i take her for some skin theraphies in future,if so at wat age? please guide me.","Doctor":"Please stop thinking in this way.

You should, afterward, lay him on his right side with you sitting by his side to prevent him from rolling over on his stomach and crushing his own face and nose. Or, you may lay him on his tummy on your leg and gently stroke his back every time after he has burped adequately.Give him no medicines as this is physiological regurgitation.

The MRI has diagnosed infection of the middle ear and the mastoid bone (oto-mastoiditis). This is a long-seated infection and will need long-term antibiotics, after which they will repeat the MRI to see how much of the infection has already got cured. In some cases, they need to operate and remove the infected material from inside the bone by opening up the mastoid from outside. I am confident that your daughter will recover soon. You will need to directly ask the doctor to explain the whole thing again with pictures and so on and so forth. Before surgery, I am sure it will be really important for you to understand every little thing about the problem as they will need you to give consent for the operation, if it is needed.

He was unusually fussy going to bed last night, but once he was asleep he stayed that way until morning.  He does not seem feverish except the rash feels warm to the touch.  Can you shed any light on this for us?  Thanks.","Doctor":"From what you are describing, these rashes are probably wheals - urticaria in medical language. They come in response to some form of allergy - against food, against contactants like soaps, body creams, etc., against cold water, against insect bites, etc. They will be warm, and they will typically come and go for several days. Give him an anti-allergic medicine like loratadine. You may also apply Caladryl lotion twice a day on the affected portions. In rare cases, he may need an oral steroid medication.Flags would be raised if the rash isn't better in a week, if there is bleeding from the skin due to itching, if he has any general symptoms like fever, difficulty in breathing, cloudy urine or fast heart-beat, or if he gets extremely itchy and cannot sleep or eat or do any normal activities. In that case, you may go to the ER.

After reading your post, it seems that your daughter is having some infection in intestine leading to pain in abdomen, fever and diarrhoea. You can send her stool for examination. She should be treated with antispasmodic like dicycloverine , antacid like omeprazole, probiotic  and antibiotic according to the report of the stool investigation. Paracetamol can be given for fever. She should be given any medicines after getting her medically examined by her Paeditrician.

Yes, the use of Budecort, an inhaled steroid, is all right if given even up to a few years, so don't worry. Remember to make her gargle her mouth and brush her teeth and gums after every use of Budecort. Stop using Relent. Continue Levolin also as an inhaler - you can use up to 7 to 8 times in 24 hours to stop the cough. Duolin nebulisation can be used initially, but will have no benefit once her symptoms are better.

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day.

For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do.NO NEED TO USE ANTIBIOTICS FOR TRIVIAL VIRAL ILLNESS LIKE THIS.If there is fever - Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.For cold you can use Cetrizine at 0.25mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days.For nasal block, plain saline nasal drops will do, every 4-6th hourly to relive nasal congestion.Regards - Dr. Sumanth MBBS., DCH., DNB (Paed).,"},{"Patient":"My 9 year old daughter has been complaining on and off of stomach ache for some time - we went to see a peadiatrician who has told her to eep a food diary for 2 months -  we are due to go back in March - she was also constipated but this has eased and she is now suffering from really bad dizzy spells and headaches - she says her head is spinning faster and faster and it makes her feel sick as well as stomach aches . . .  any ideas?","Doctor":"Hi...by what you quote I feel that your kid might be having a vertigo which is related to a middle ear problem.

Whether there will any problem in growth of the child ? We have to undergo any thyroid test.Please advise!","Doctor":"Did you mean polyposis? Or polyosis? In fact, polyosis is the same as polyposis and refers to the development of hanging benign tumors in the lining of the large intestine of a person. This can be an inherited condition. Occasionally, such tumors (called polyps) can turn into cancerous tumors. On the other hand, white-forelock can be independently inherited from the father's side and has no direct relationship with polyosis. Sometimes, a white forelock is part of a genetic syndrome such as the Wardenburg's syndrome.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"My 5-year old daughter has mild cerebral palsy.  She has many of the related conditions including seizures, GERD, hypotonicity, chronic constipation, neurogenic bladder, sensory processing disorder, oral-motor difficulties and global developmental delay.  She has been in PT, OT and speech since she was 9-months old.  We have only recently, however, discovered that her tongue does not move to the right which makes her speech and feeding issues much more difficult.  Her MRI showed enlarged ventricles, atrophy in the frontal lobe and hypoplastic corpus callosum.  What would cause her tongue to be unable to move to the right and are there any specific therapy techniques that would help?  Thank you!","Doctor":"It seems that spasticity of the muscles that move the tongue to the left (which means muscles on the right lower jaw) has prevented movement of the other sided muscles. If the problem is pervasive, and not resolved with muscle-relaxants, you may consider surgery to cut the muscles that are spastic or consider botox injections into the affected muscles.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"My 4 ur old some is spitting up blood with clots. It's not just spit tinged pink it is all blood with small dime sized clots. His stomach was hurting last night and he had a fever and headache as well. Now he says his stomach is fine. What us goin on with him??","Doctor":"He may have had an ulcer in the lining of his lower oesophagus (the food-pipe) due to retching and vomiting. Clots indicates that the blood may have emanated from the stomach as well. You should urgently visit a pediatric gastroenterologist to evaluate the problem further, even if he is okay at present.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"I started having stomach pains yesterday after eating lunch. It hurt very bad and with all the way to my back. A hot bath took all the pain away, but maybe 30 mnutes later it began again. It would be very severe for about 3 minutes and then I woud be fine for 15 - 20 minutes. After I went to bed, it was good for the night. I woke up feeling great. No pain. I ate a piece of toast and eveything was still good. After I eat anything larger I get the pain. I plan to keep a diary of foods to see it I have developed an allergy . I am 57 and never thought about developing one this late in life.","Doctor":"thank you. have you vomiting or diarrhea ? it may be a one type of acute inflammation of the stomach. now you will take small meal with frequent interval. avoid large fatty meal. within 2-3 days it will be fine."},{"Patient":"Hello, I am a grandma of an 8 month old girl. She weighed 6lbs 6 ozs when born last May. She is now 8 months and weighs 14lbs 8 ozs. She is happy and healthy, but never seems to be interested in food or milk. My daughter breast feed until 6 months, but because she wasn't gaining well she decided to switch to formula. She has been getting cereal, vegetables and fruit for about 3 months now, but every meal is a struggle for my daughter and at the most she will only eat a couple of tablespoons of cereal or an ice cube size portion of vegetable or fruit. The most she will take at a bottle feeding is 5 to 6 ounzes, but most times this is much less, around 3 or 4 ounzes. My daughter sees other friends that have younger babies and how much they eat and is worried. Do you have ant advice?","Doctor":"The most important advice I can give you is that every baby is different and have different rates of metabolism. Some kids need more food to generate the same weight gain, some, less. In my humble opinion as a pediatrician, I think your granddaughter is doing quite well, weight-wise, so I would not worry. I would suggest you stop bottle-feeding her completely and let her decide how much she wants to eat with a feeding cup. This is completely possible - and you will find that she will accept milk more readily."},{"Patient":"I have contact with a 20 month, male toddler. He has a flushed facial and upper (outside) arm symptoms. These areas are hot to touch. No known allergens. He has had clear runny nose for three days and went on a hiking trip last weekend.

The Other possibility is a viral infection associated with rash on the face and hands. This could be contagious or not. I suggest that if you develop fever or any Rash you consult your physician immediately.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi doc, I have a 2 1/2 year daughter with down syndrome.

Today she got back her fever ( 38.7C) and I noticed that she had a yellow green foul smelling stool. What can be the cause of it? Thanks in Avance. Yours sincerely, Worried mum","Doctor":"Hi...by what you quote I feel that your daughter is going through a viral illness.  Fever with Rash followed by diarrhoea is usually suggestive of a viral infection.  Regarding Rash you need not worry unless the kid is very sick.  If the kid is playing around you need not worry.  Regarding diarrhea unless the kid is having blood in the motion or low urine output are abdominal distension or green bilious vomiting you need not worry.I suggest you use zinc supplements and ORS to prevent dehydration.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Concerns for my daughter My daughter is two months old she was born after two days of being in labour and them breaking my waters n bringing my labour on by a drip then using the suction cup to pull her out after being dilated for two days when she was born I noticed she would shake her leg like a quiver but never thought much of it as I thought it might be her going to the toilet until a week later it mooved from that leg to her arm and mouth on the same side eventually it came to a point where her hole body would shake at time where I felt her spine shake and she would spew or have white frothy bubbles at her mouth I took her to see a peadiatrician who simply said it was a banine thing and she would grow out of it and it slowly stopped for a while but as of a week ago her legs and mouth have started to shake again but its not just that I have noticed she cant moove both legs at the same time she can only get one to moove with the other stopping half way the same thing with her arms she is also very stiff constantly and if her hands are open or closed when she goes stiff it takes her a while to close or open them again I have also noticed that her toes curl up and she cant uncurl them and has alot of trouble sleeping as in having to be held and as soon as you put her down she wakes up I took her to the doctor again and two doctors suggested I take her back to the peadiatrician as he was spose to do an ecg and blood test and she needs one done I want another opionion as to what another doctor may think this all could be thank you","Doctor":"Hi.... by what you Quote I feel your baby is having seizures. The history which you have provided regarding your pregnancy and associated complications during childbirth are also suggestive of the same. Your baby will require evaluation for seizures in the form of EEG and she might also required neuroimaging like ultrasound cranium or an MRI brain. Apart  from this she will require metabolic work up like Serum calcium magnesium and other electrolytes level in the blood.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"I was just wondering what on my 2 yr olds xray. there is poor inspiratory volume resulting in crowding of the central bronchovascular markings. What does this mean?? Shes has history or Retrophargeal cellulitus which she was hospitalized for a yr ago and has reoccurant croup about every 2-3 months since then.","Doctor":"Hi.... by what you got I feel that your kid might be having and upper airway resistance syndrome otherwise and upper Airway blockade for free movement of air through it. Low inspiratory volume on chest X-ray of the lungs means that the kid is not able to generate sufficient pressure to suck in sufficient volume of air into the lungs. If the kid is snoring or has got an inspiratory stridor - this is again suggestive of the above mentioned condition.The kid  will required evaluation by experience and paediatric ENT surgeon or a pulmonologist.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi I have a 2 and a half year old daughter who was born at 7 months, she was a premiee and stayed in the nicu for close to 2months, her gross & fine motor skilss are great, her speech is delayed... but she keeps having these nose bleeds... should i be concerned? Literally blood is pouring out..","Doctor":"Hi... if it had been occasional nose bleeds you need not worry. But as you quote that literally the blood is pouring out I suggest that she requires evaluation for bleeding disorder.If the bleeding is always from a particular single nose you need not worry but if the bleeding is from both nostrils and very very frequent definitely this requires evaluation by a experience with paediatric ENT surgeon after bleeding disorder has been ruled out by pediatrician.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My toddler has peeling skin on the tip of his penis, any idea what could have caused this? He s recently potty trained and of course is always grabbing at himself down there. We ve just kinda figured it was from him having outdoor plumbing . He told me it hurts so I put vasaline on it, any other suggestions?","Doctor":"Hi... by what you Quote I feel that he has a habit of handling his genitalia, but this habit will go off if you ignore it and as the child grows. But the skin peeling which you have referred to I feel is because of frequent handling of the genitalia by toddler. What you are currently doing is perfectly fine - applying Vaseline, but if there is redness or swelling in the area then it is suggestive of bacterial infection & in such a case I suggest you seek the consultation of your pediatrician.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my 3 year old gets a rash on her left cheek.  it happens overnight and is really red in the morning then disappears by the end of the day.

It could also be a form of contact dermatitis. But as you quote that it has started to scar the area I feel that it could be an eczema which is there for a long time. I suggest a paediatric Dermatologist for this meanwhile you can use oilatum lotion rather than using steroid cream like hydrocortisone.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my daughter is 5 years old.

Any ideas?","Doctor":"In pseudohypoaldosteronism, there is a lowering of the plasma sodium and relative state of dehydration ... which can produce fever.

Today, he has a lacey rash on both arms. Rash is not itchy or raised but under skin. He has an appointment this afternoon, but just thought I d ask your opinion now. Thank You!!","Doctor":"The lacey rash may either be a reaction to some contactant like powder, soap, cream or lotion. It will need only removal of the offending agent. For some time, avoid all these products. Use a hypoallergenic soap.The pain in the legs is a form of growing pain. Just use ibuprofen syrup as and when it is needed. No other treatment is needed."},{"Patient":"My 4 month old baby just had an extreme crying fit due to being overtired but now (even though he's asleep) is doing a double breath. I've seen it last for a few minutes where someone who is crying hard is trying to catch their breath but this has been a good 20 minutes now. Is there anything I can do or will he re-compose himself eventually?","Doctor":"He will recompose himself, as this is a breath-holding spell. It has no negative consequences except for the discomfort and the fear it causes in the parent or care-giver. You may make him cry again through the holding episode by administering a little pain to him or splashing him with cold water."},{"Patient":"my daughter 2yrs 9 months since she was not able to talk and not listening often no eye to eye contact not saying no or yes behaving rudely how come to solve doctor says bilateral epi lepto form dys function and prescribes medicine is it advicable she was a girl any side effects med;iq plus,risdone mt 0.5 ,encorate","Doctor":"Behavioural disturbances are most likely due to her medications.

I was told to give her 4-5 days; if pain subsided, do nothing, if still in pain, take her to an orthopedist.  She is not complaining of any pain and certainly desires to resume normal activity.  My questions are: Do we just let it go if she has no pain?  Should we be restricting her activities at all? Is an orthopedic consult warranted just based on the diagnosis, even if pain is gone?  She is only 4 and I fear long-term consequences in her still-growing body, but also do not want to overreact...any input would be greatly appreciated!","Doctor":"I would first begin by asking you who diagnosed the mildly displaced sacrum malady? Was it not an orthopedic surgeon? If not, why was she not referred to one at that time itself? If the doctor was an ortho surgeon, why not ask that doctor again? I am aware that this is an online query, and I appreciate your anxiety, but I do think that you should be first and foremost thinking about the here and now, rather than what will happen in the future. If the diagnosis is certain, then the ortho surgeon, and that too someone trained in paediatric orthopedics, would be the right professional to go to.I think you should continue to be cautious till you have a clear picture of what happened and of what is happening to her without being emotional about it.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"My son has a 3 mm muscular vsd type maladie de roger discovered at one day.

It is quite common for babies of this age group t pass small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhea and especially antibiotics are not indicated.When the baby takes milk , the stomach expands - then when it is contracting it sets off a wave form which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum, a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out.

Its gotten bigger in the past couple of weeks. I have taken him to the doctor and they feel that it is a swollen lymph node due to his being ill. He has had cough and cold for about a month and for the past two weeks a double ear infection that I have been treating with antibiotics. I am starting to worry that he has something seriously wrong like (cancer) or something. Should I be really concerned here?","Doctor":"Hi dear,I understand your concernIt seems he has reactive lymphadenopathy due viral infection.You should be worried,but not too much.Observe for lymph.node, if it will decrease till 1sm,it is normal. If it will more,then 1 am,then perform blood test to exclude mononucleosis, other viral infection as herpes, for this you can give Ig M,G to HHV 6 type,Cytomegalovirus, EBV. It is also important to perform throat culture and consult child at ENT doctor to exclude chronic infection:adenoids,tonsillitis,ethmoiditis.If everything is Ok.You should wait at least 1month,it will decrease.For speedy recovery you should put on compress with Camphor every night(crash 2tablets,mix with water and apply to node,it will resolve, Camphor is strong antibiotics inflammed medicine).Please contact me before visiting your primary doctor.Wishing your baby good health"},{"Patient":"To Whom It May Concern, I have a 3weeks-old boy and his upper lip has got a thick layer,then that layer turn dried,white and I put vasinline on it and the dried skin go off.

If he prefers to be prone, and you make sure that his nose isn't getting pinched by the bedsheets and pillows, then there is no problem ... except that you should be near him when he is lying on his stomach.

I can only describe it as looking like he is wearing foundation. Its not itchy and he has no other symptoms.He hasn t changed any of his soaps or the way he washes and he is not on medication or drugs.","Doctor":"A viral rash may lead to reddish coloration of the face. Orange coloration is unheard of except with what is named \\"carotenemia\\" - which is when the high carotene levels in the blood produce an orangy tinge to the whole body and not just to the face. That happens very rarely, and can follow overeating of carrots - but, as I said, it is extremely rare."},{"Patient":"My 13 year old daughter just showed me that the bottom of her rib cage is not symmetrical. It seems that in the lower portion of both sides, the ribs are curving inward a bit more than what is normal and on one side the exaggerated inward curve starts about one rib higher than the other side. I don t know if this is a change in her rib cage or something we have never noticed before. Her dad has a rib cage deformity on one side, closer to his mid-chest that is nothing like this (his is more of a protrusion) and was told it was from years of breathing difficulties from childhood asthma. I can t imagine they are related, but I thought I d provide the info anyway.","Doctor":"You are correct in assuming that the condition in the father and in the daughter are probably unrelated. What your daughter has, to use jargon, is pectus excavatum - or, in English, an excavated chest. This is probably present since birth, and has got exaggerated now that she is growing fast. You shouldn't worry about it, as it is just a minor disfigurement, and will not affect her in any functional way.

Want to know how we can ensure that a kid of his age keeps the glasses on all the time, will the power decrease if glasses are worn & increase if glasses are not worn now. Are there any remedies or medicines that will help in reducing the power. What precautions have to be taken to ensure that power does not increase or reduces. Thank you","Doctor":"I am really sorry that your son is having to face these problems. You should have glasses with a tie at the back so that he cannot remove them. (Of course, once he is sleepy or has gone to sleep, you can remove them for the entire night). There is no truth in the belief that if you keep the glasses on, the number will reduce. In fact, if his eye is developing a problem that will cause his number to increase, even his wearing the glasses continuously cannot prevent this from happening. There is nothing that you can do to ensure that these changes do not happen. Your ophthalmologist is the best person to take counsel from. He should check the child's lens and the entire eye to determine how the future will go. I would advise you to continue following his advice and to never neglect your son's eyes, as neglected error of refraction will affect his learning at school, his brain development and all aspects of his life.Best wishes.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"My six year old daughter has experienced intermittent abd pain above her umbilicus with occasional vomiting for 5 weeks.

The KUB results came in today and we were told she has an enlarged liver and it was strongly suggested that we see her routine Pediatrician to set up US and further testing.  What could cause the abd pain, vomiting for this long and an enlarged liver?","Doctor":"It is very difficult to give you an exact diagnosis. Past viral infection of the liver, some other form of inflammation, bile duct sluggishness, fatty liver change, etc. are some of the causes of an enlarged liver. The commonest cause is a viral infection. You should be going to the Pedia dr. as early as possible. He will advise blood tests to see liver enzymes and functions in addition to the white cell count, which he is sure to repeat. Once these are done, do revert with your follow-up.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"my baby is 12 months old and i just got her out of the bath and she has a small area that looks like a honey comb on her forehead. it isnt a rash but more like bumps the whole area is about the size of a dime. what could it be and should I be worried?","Doctor":"Is it paining or oozing?

I also had a lap done about 6 weeks ago for severe right sided pelvic pain and had several cysts vaporized on my only ovary. The CT from today said I didn t have any cysts, but there is a bunch of free fluid around the ovary. What causes the fluid and can the fluid be causing the pain?","Doctor":"Hi. As per your letter,you may be probably having Polycystic ovarian disease on right side.But,pain due to it is rare.An Ovarian cyst can rotate along its own axis(Torsion) and may cause pain,but this complication is rare in Polycystic disease. As your cysts were dealt through laparoscopy,nothing to worry. But the fluid that is present may be Reactionary fluid due to the procedure or it may collected fluid after the cysts rupture.Pain may not be due to fluid. It will be absorbed in course of time. If you had previous history of kidney stones,get IVP(Intra venous pyelogram) done by the advice of Urologist even though CT is normal for stones.

What can u suggest, i really want to stop it, as it's a steriod and it might have a long run effect on her liver.","Doctor":"By \\"shot\\" did you mean an injection or an inhaler? If it is inhaler that you are talking about, then, first of all, beclomethasone is not appropriate for a child. It may be better to give fluticasone or budesonide inhalers.Secondly, if she has been without a single episode of breathing difficulty since a year, sure, why not first cut out the night dose and continue with once a day 100 micrograms for a month or so, and then kill the morning dose as well. If, however, cutting down the morning dose causes any recurrence of her wheezing or asthma, you should be visiting a specialist urgently to take guidance.Hope she is well soon.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"My daughter is 4 weeks.

Am I overfeeding her?  what can I do to make her life easier?Thanks","Doctor":"Why isn't she fed directly on the breast? If you have nipple issues, I am sure the lactation specialist nurse can assist you. Why soy milk and not normal milk? And why bottle feeds at night? What prevents you from exclusively breastfeeding her? This question has many such issues where interaction with you is needed. I cannot be sure that there is underfeeding or overfeeding since you did not provide me with her birth weight. Do consider asking the detailed question directly.In the meantime, may I suggest that you stop giving her soy milk unless there are reasons that you haven't disclosed. Switch over to a normal milk formula that has anti-colic ingredients (Novalac AC is an example). Take her to a pediatrician to confirm that there is no narrowing of her anus or anal canal that is causing this problem, or a redness around the anus that is causing pain and preventing her from evacuating properly. Other than that, I cannot advise you of any more measures that you can take without examining her.Wishing her a speedy resolution of the problems.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"My six year old has been complaining that her feet fall asleep on a very frequent basis.

It has to do with the nerves that supply her legs with sensation, and these nerves are connected to the spine and get blood supply from the heart. Does she have any spinal symptoms/deformties? Any problems with running, walking or any other movements when she is playing or performing normal activities? Does she have any overt vitamin deficiencies?

It is a self limiting prolonged viral illness. rarely it can cause complications. I will suggest you how a viral illness behaves so that you will be more confident. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days.

But usually kids grow out of it...that is as the age progresses.But to be sure that it is eczema and nothing else, I need to see the images as skin conditions are best diagnosed by seeing them. I suggest you upload the images in this website so that I can guide you scientifically.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hello, My son is 3 1/2 years old and just got over his first vomiting and diarrhea episode that lasted about 3/4 days. He s been better for a couple of days, and is complaining about his butt being itchy. I figured it was from the diarrhea, but when I looked he had white bumps around his anus. He s had small red bumps on the cheeks of his butt for awhile now also. I m not sure if any or all of this is related. Thank you, Amy","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic. Looks like everything is related to viral illness.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time.

It does not matter how many times she puts deodorant under her armpits it doesn t last long and the odor comes back. What can I do about this?

Not only that as she's 10 years old, she might be entering into adolescent phase of glandular development where in the odoriferous sebaceous glands start developing.

The only way to treat eczema is to keep the areas moist and not letting dry.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi I have a three old kid he is having sticky stoles with smell and undergoing homeopathy treatment for last two months , he is having two to three motions of (semisolid to solid) consistency vary from time to time . one doctor has suggested me Zenflox oZ 7ml for 5 days is it fine?","Doctor":"Hi...this us not diarrhea and this doesn't require antibiotic like Zenflox OZ. Unless there is blood in the stools antibiotics are not required.The frequency and consistency of motion which you have mentioned are not suggestive....Bacterial dysentery.It seems your kid is having viral diarrhoea.

There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My daughter (3 year 9 months old) is getting some rash around her mouth.

This is one viral illness among all other exanthemas which can cause fever followed by rash over palms and soles. It is a self-limiting disorder and itching can be really worrisome.

It is a good thing appendicitis and hernia were ruled out, but hopefully through both a physical examination as well as an ultrasound investigation. As you have not mentioned an ultrasound investigation, I would advise you to go through with one, it is not painful at all, and can greatly help in visualizing any source, that could be causing your tenderness. The bloating could also be due to an irregular diet and unhealthy eating habits.

I feel that your baby is having cow's milk protein allergy. Unusually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds.  3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4. If you feel your feeds alone are inadequate for the baby, then Zerolac is the only option till 6 months age.

If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics LIKE COLISTIN - unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).1. Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do. Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridges & soups.2. Do not start Colistin.3. Racecadotril is not indicated and licnesed in this age group.4. WHO recommended ORS will not cause overload on kidneys.Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

After several tests and x-rays, a barium enema that finally relieved her of gas and feces, they were going to send her home with no real answer as to why it was distended.(The xray should her intestines full of gas, but no obstruction) Hirschbrungs has not been ruled out (no biopsy yet), but she shows no other signs or symptoms so they don't really want to do the biopsy until everything else has been tested. This morning her mom was able to nurse her and her belly swelled up again so they kept her in NICU.  By the way, she has an identical twin sister not really showing signs of distention but she is restless after nursing also.  They have a 2 year old brother with severe dairy allergies (lethal reaction).  Just wondering if they (the twins) could be allergic to dairy in their mommy's breastmilk and this could be the cause of the distention?","Doctor":"HI...I congratulate you on providing me a detailed hjistory. it was very useful. By what you quote I put forth 2 possibilities - 1. Hirschsprungs Disease. - as you said it needs  biopsy.2. Cow's milk protein allergy.I was expecting that there should have been a history of cow's milk and formula feed (this too contains cow's milk protein) given to the baby. I feel that your baby is having cow's milk protein allergy. Unusually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds.  3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4. If you feel your feeds alone are inadequate for the baby, then Zerolac is the only option till 6 months age. I request you to keep me posted about the recovery of the baby and follow of the case.Regards – Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My 7 yr old has childhood absence seizures.

I appreciate your efforts for medical consultation in so much distress.

Ibuprofen given on empty stomach can cause drug induced gastritis. If this happens this is what you should do - 1. Stop giving not only Ibuprofen - but also avoid any NSAID group of drugs.2. Next time when you go to the physician you need to inform about this happening to the doctor so that he or she will be cautious in prescribing NSAIDs.3. You need to use proton pump inhibitors (drugs like Lansoprazole or Pantoprazole). I suggest you see a pediatrician for this.4. You can give lots of curds and buttermilk to reduce the gastritis as home remedy.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My son is on busiprone and abilify. He has autism.

If you also see a lump in that spot when you strain, or cough , that confirms it. It could be a very small defect and abdominal contents like small portion of the intestine can protrude through the defect. If the prtrusion stays and if you can't push it back, then it becomes an emergency situation. That is called as \\"Strangulated Hernia\\" and requires emergency surgery for correction.

This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in air too. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief.The two best ways to relieve this distress is - 1. Do not put the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2. If still crying - put the baby in prone position and keep patting the back gently so that the baby passes off the flatus and gets relieved.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

It is less likely caused by a bacteria, in those cases there is usually fever and blood in the stool. You should drink small amounts, if stomach lining is irritated then it would be difficult to keep in alot at one time. Drink a small amount, wait at least 5 minutes before taking another small amount. You should use the oral rehydration fluids which would replace the different electrolytes you are losing. Medication normally used for reflux such as pepcid, omeprazole and others in those drug families may help with the irritation and pain that your are experiencing. In addition medication like gravol may help with the vomiting. If it progresses and is associated with significant discomfort then you should consider visiting your doctor for an assessment.

This can even cause some peeling of skin in the next while its recovering and do not worry about it.There's one another possibility with rash and skin peeling if the kid had high grade fever of more than 5 days duration and the kid has been sick....its Kawasaki Disease. If this is so he will require certain investigations and an ECHO of the heart. I suggest you consult your pediatrician for this.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my grandchild which is 4 months has been throwing up for two days,her dr said to give her diluted formula 4 oz of milk to 6 oz of pedilite still sick i was always told to stop milk for 24 hours and just give pedilyte but if he wants her to have milk can i give her flat ginger ale to help settle her stomache? my son has called him and he says its a virus and will last 5 to 7 days without even seeing her and this is projectile vonit help concerned grand mother","Doctor":"Dear Grandmom,Please do not experiment with such a small baby. You would be better off taking her to the A & E rather than giving ginger ale. Just my humble opinion."},{"Patient":"my grand daughter is suffering from cold and cough since 15 days .Dr prescribed ambrodil.s syrup and clavam .she is monthsold..she has strong resistence against medicine.with great effort we could give  her medicine for  5 days(doctor said period)she was o.k. for one week.now she is again having same problem.and in the night while feeding she is omiting.what is to be done","Doctor":"Please start Ambrodil S again tonight, but vomiting cannot be stopped with that. You should take her to the doctor tomorrow morning. For vomiting, give her Domperidone syrup 1 ml thrice in a day before giving other medicines. Do not use Clavam again."},{"Patient":"this for my 7 year old daughter. she has a viral fever with rash all over her body. she is absolutely fine though and is up and playing ok. the rash on her face has now started to exfoliate and it looks very distressing. can i use any creams to help her?","Doctor":"There is no need for any creams for this problem, but if you want to really use something, you may apply a cold cream like Nivea. No medicinal or steroid creams are indicated."},{"Patient":"My 6 week old baby was given gentamicin and developed a very itchy rash on her face, and she began furtively scratching at her face/head. The rash is now gone but she continues rubbing at her head above her ears. Is it possible she has tinnitus (a possible side effect of the drug)? How could I find out? Thanks","Doctor":"I think you should rule out an ear infection. Tinnitus is seen with higher than usual doses and not with the correct usage of gentamicin. There is, unfortunately, no way to find out if she has tinnitus. She needs a visit to the ENT doctor who is trained to look at small kids."},{"Patient":"sir/madam,my 3 years old baby girl is suffering mild or moderate belly pain, pale stool with some solide and some lequied stool. her previous case history one month ago she got belley pain and vomiting 4 to 5 times, then my dr. prescribe lansoprazol 15mg, and emiset to stop vomiting. then she got loose motion so dr. first prescribed livofloxacin and then ofloxacin. problem was cure for that period, now during 3 to 4 days she again got belley pain, then i given her the medicin neopeptine as i think it was for indigestion, but i found mild or moderate belly pain, pale stool with some solide and some lequied part. what should i do now.","Doctor":"The first thing to do when the same symptoms are repeated is to get her investigated. Do check her out with a stool test, an ultrasound of her abdomen and a complete blood count initially. Take her to the pediatrician with the results of these tests. Or go to the doctor beforehand and ensure that they order those tests."},{"Patient":"Dear Sir/Madam, My son is Autistic  diagnosed by NIHMANS , Bangalore in the year 2001 and presently we are residing at Noida (NCR). Recently we came to know that in India many of the private hospitals at Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Pune started stem cell therapy for autism and claiming clinical improvement ,consequently it ignited a hope for his better future. In view of above we want to know that: 1-  Is stem cell therapy really beneficial in autism? Regards M.K.GOYAL +0000","Doctor":"Dear Mr. Goyal,At best, stem cell therapy is experimental in nature. I would be unable to either recommend it to you or deter you from going ahead. You should visit a stem cell therapy center and meet the doctor first and resolve all the doubts before you go ahead with it. You should note that the same thing applies to chelation therapy for autism. Beware of money-making rackets! Do your own research before submitting your son to an experiment which is likely very expensive.Remember also that autism tends to reduce as the child grows older. I hope you are going to the counsellor and their multi-pronged behavioural remedial therapy!"},{"Patient":"My two year old grandson had a rash suddenly appear (about a week ago) around his neck, ears, scalp, and a little bit on his back, arms and legs.  It sometimes looks like it is getting better, then all of a sudden flares up again.  It is making him itchy.  It looks like contact dermatitis to me, but we haven't done anything new or different in regards to his food or detgergents.  He has never had a problem with rashes before.","Doctor":"Indeed it may either be a contact dermatitis or some other form of allergy. Please start him on an allergy syrup after consulting your GP. You can also apply Calamine lotion to his body twice a day. If no response or relief in 3-5 days, take him to a specialist."},{"Patient":"I have a 8 year old daughter in good health that for the last several weeks has been complaning of random sharp pains on the right side of her head that last several seconds then goes away.  She had one this am and she wen to her knees crying and stating that it hurt really bad.  Then a few seconds later it was gone.  She has complained of headaches more often than ususal also.  What could this be we do have appt with our eye Dr. today","Doctor":"Please see her pediatrician first, as sudden sharp headaches can be due to more serious illnesses like migraine, tension and even brain infections and tumors. Not trying to scare you, but eye problems are unlikely to cause such sharp and severe sudden headaches."},{"Patient":"my 2yr old daughter has little red bumps on her vagina and has had them for about a month now she is somewhat potty trained but still wears a diaper at nap and bedtime. I have tried typical rash cremes, zinc, natural ointments but they don't seem to be clearing up at all what could it be.","Doctor":"This could either be viral or fungal infection, an allergy to the various creams that you are applying, a diaper rash or something else. Please visit a specialist for this."},{"Patient":"Hello, my name is Krystal. Im 18, 5 4 , and I weigh about 230.

I went to bed several hours later feeling fine, but whenever I got up I had/have a sharp pain in my lower abdomen ...going across my stomach. I feel fine if I lay down but standing up straight is difficult. It also hurts when I sneeze . I am on my period, but I rarely get pain like this. I dont have a fever , but I do feel neasous.","Doctor":"hello and welcome to healthcare magic forum! it might be gas in the abdomen. is the pain in the whole of the lower abdomen or more in the right side.

He currently has several red small dry patches on his face. They are perfectly round and size are a little bigger than an pencil eraser. He has gained a new spot over night. We are leaving out of town for two days. Is there something over the counter, or do I need to get him in to see a doc when we return?","Doctor":"This is most likely an allergic rash (Pityriasis rosea - check it out on the net), and you would have to apply a mild steroid cream for this. However, this would be best seen by a doctor when you return from your small trip."},{"Patient":"My six week old son has one ear that appears larger and thicker/puffier in the lobe and outside edge than the other. It is not hot to the touch or redder than the other ear. It is his right ear, which he tends to lay on more often. I just noticed this a few days ago. He is just getting over a fairly mild upper respiratory infection.","Doctor":"Yes, this can be a normal variation, and it could be related to his sleeping posture. Don't worry, unless it remains the same beyond his first six months. Once he starts to sit up, the asymmetry is most likely to disappear."},{"Patient":"My son is a year and a 2 months. He cries when he tries to go to the restroom and I dont know if he is constipated because he does have a BM he just screams and strains to go. But when he does go it is a squirt or it, runny or pasty but never a lot or hard. He now developed a rash and I dont know if that is what causing him discomfort or not. Do you know if he is constipated or is he screaming because of his rash?","Doctor":"He is most likely screaming because of the rash around his anal orifice. Please start applying a zinc cream and a dusting powder to allow the rash to heal."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries?  Please type your query here...my daughter 3 months old diagnosed by ostium secundum 7mm she will go by its own or she will need surgerymy doctor describe lasix with potassium syrup thats enough or notplz help","Doctor":"The lasix and potassium are to prevent her heart from malfunctioning due to the abnormal circulation causing stress on the heart. The defect may either stay the same and keep causing problems or may become free from symptoms over years. It is impossible to say at this stage whether she has to have surgery. I would probably say she might need it later, once she is a bit heavier and bigger."},{"Patient":"Hi this Pushparghya writing in from India. According to IST, it is night, but still Good evening!!!Hope u r also doing great. Since last 3 days, my brother son was suffering from acute pain in abdomen. He is 8 yrs old.After USG, report says that the liver has enlarge tendency. But he is too young and he does not take any outside food. What should be the cause and how that can be taken care of???","Doctor":"Liver enlargement can be due to many reasons, but the most likely reason is infective jaundice due to water or food contamination with hepatitis virus A. Please take him to his physician and request him to order blood tests to check bilirubin, liver enzymes etc. The ultrasound has already shown an enlarged liver, but now we need to confirm the cause of this enlargement. Treatment will depend on the cause."},{"Patient":"My 11 year old son was recently diagnosed with Chiari malformation. Can this be related to his dyslexia and learning difficulties? He has had migraines since he was in pre-school and medication seems to decrease the frequency but can these migraines be cause from the CM?","Doctor":"The Chiari malformation is a problem of the brain-stem and not directly related to higher brain functions. I would suggest that he be evaluated separately to first rule out raised intracranial pressure due to any fluid collection in his brain. If that is present, it can produce an effect on the whole brain's function, including disordered functioning of the intellectual areas of the brain, viz, the forebrain."},{"Patient":"My son is almost 3 years old-he has been vomiting on and off for a little over 2 weeks.  Occasional diarrhea-every other day-he was usually very active-the last day or 2 seems more tired than usual. We took him his pediatrician today and he said it was a virus-he coughs right before he vomits-I was thinking post nasal drip. Isn't too long to be a virus?  What are your thoughts? No fever.","Doctor":"Sometimes, viruses take a longer time to clear. However, to be sure, you should do his stool exam and his blood counts so that, if needed, he can be started on antibiotics. Post-nasal drip is unlikely in a three-year old child. The more likely cause of his cough are adenoids."},{"Patient":"I have a 2 year old son , who 2 days ago went and grabbed a cup of hot water off the counter and it spilled on top of his head, there was nothing there untill today when I noticed his hair looked wet in one spot, where he spilled the hot water... it was yellow puss coming from his head,, should I be worried and take my son to the emergancy?","Doctor":"Yes, you should at least take him to the GP. The GP would then decide if he needs expert care. The burned skin has probably sloughed off and left behind a raw area that has got infected."},{"Patient":"I have noticed a hard peas size knot at the back of right ear of my 13 month old son, immovable & appears to be non tender since my son was not bothered when I touched it. He does not have fever, runny nose, cough, not pulling his ears. What could be the cause of this?","Doctor":"This is most likely a lymph gland. It can occur with, as you rightly think, ear, throat and nose problems, but also due to infections and injuries of the skin of the scalp and the surrounding areas. If painless, you need not do anything. It will either remain the same, or gradually reduce over years."},{"Patient":"hi my son 28 months now and before some months have some thing problem with him suddenly he is pastout and some times suddenly look like he is not well and he is very sleeply and some time he lipes suddenly blue and then feent we have already done a lot of test all brain test but doctor say every thing is fine but doctor again doing again test can u tell me what happend my baby","Doctor":"This might be one of several things: a syncope is when children faint due to loss of blood supply to the brain for a very, very short duration. It can be harmless, or be due to some internal illnesses of the heart and blood vessels,or of other organs. The second possibility is an attack of breath-holding due to stubbornness - again there are no long term effects of this. The last is - fits - which needs proper therapy from a specialist."},{"Patient":"i am female 50 yrs old i have urine infection and stabbing bladder pain for more then week now, and was prescribed antibiotic ( trimethroprim) 3 days course, din t help, went back to doctors and was given amoxicillin 7 days, but it s been 4 days now that i am taking and still i have sharp abdominal pain and i am so bloated. what do i do ?","Doctor":"hi there, you may be suffering from UTI caused by an organism resistant to amox or trimethoprim so the next course of action would be to get your urine examined for microscopy and culture and senstivity and according to the senstivity of the organism new course of antibiotics should be prescribed. The bloating sensation could be a side effect of amoxycillin and I suggest that you take a probiotic tablet along with the antibiotics.Drink plenty of fluids and you could take syrup citralka along with the water to decrease the burning  and pain symptoms. Get a correct diagnosis and treatment for permanent relief. Take care."},{"Patient":"My nine year old daughter has had a cough since October.

If you listen with a stethoscope she has wheezing in her lower right lung on inspiration but a chest xray shows normal. We are very concerned. What should we do?","Doctor":"Since you have already gone through a lot of oral medications, please consider switching over to inhaled medicines. These will be very likely to work. Inhaled steroids will also be needed as we need to prevent her from getting these attacks. Please visit asthma.uk site for more details on how to control pediatric asthma. If you are averse to researching on your own, you can always request for such information from her pediatrician."},{"Patient":"My 9 year old son had been diagnosed with neutrophilic dermatosis ( pyoderma gangrenosum) also with splenic and pulmonary abscess previous arthritis ( sweet syndrome) his medication he is on is Adalimumab, cyclosporin, prednisolone, pain killers, my son has now got a lot of pain in his penis and testicles he has had a pyoderma close by about 3 months ago but it was switched off! Could the pain just be part of his illness or growing pains or could it be something else?","Doctor":"Penile pain is unlikely to be related to growing pains. You should really not be in an online forum, as his disease and medications are really complex. You should consult his doctor immediately."},{"Patient":"My five year old has been sick with an ear infection and is being treated on antibiotics for the last 48hrs. He is running a low grade fever of 100.5 consistently and this morning he woke up with c/o pounding in his chest. His heart rate at rest is 135 today. Is this abnormal?","Doctor":"Yes, a heart rate of 130+ in a five year old is abnormal, but it is in line with the fever that he has. Just continue the antibiotic for 5-6 more days if he is improving. But if he is not improving, go back to the doctor for a reassessment. He may need an ENT consult."},{"Patient":"my 8month baby is having loose motions since 7 days he had been given enterogermina,clamp and actified dm,yesterday we had given him eldopar half tablet today morning we had given him grammogel 4ml,and nutroline b 5ml still he passed stools 5 time today.","Doctor":"This is a clear example of polypharmacy.

Give him ORS to prevent dehydration."},{"Patient":"Hello, my 6 year old son is scheduled to get adenoids and maybe tonsils out.  I'm hoping this will be effective for him.  We have seen a lot of fatigue, ruled out seizures due to spacey behavior, seen a child pyschologist because he has days where he is out of it and days of clarity where he is really bright, talkative and energetic, has had a sleep apnea ruled out, but still sleeps a lot, has a regular bedtime and gets a good 10-11 hours of sleep with 5 plus hour naps, snores badly though much improved now that he's on flonase, has gotten sick a lot, strep, then vomting virus, now a sinus infection.  I'm just hoping this will help him have more energy and feel better on a daily basis.  He's also pale, cries easily, and doing well in school.","Doctor":"This question is too involved to seek help online. However, you should realise that no treatment is 100% guaranteed to be effective. If the doctor has determined that his adenoids are blocking his breathing, then removing them is the right way to go. However, in your case, he is also on steroid inhalations, and I don't know why. I also feel that he is oversleeping, if he really sleeps for 10-11 hours daily. You need to take him to a good ENT doctor for a re-evaluation, and if that does not help, you should contact a sleep specialist."},{"Patient":"My brother just had a premature baby boy. He was about 6 months and 25 months. I was told that the mother had suffer form the stomache flu and then later on transfer the illness to her unborn baby.  I don't know too much. I was later told today that the baby look develop like  a human. However, his belly was so fill of fluids. Everytime, the doctors removed the fluids out,; it seems that the belly got bigger again. Now, I hear that the poor child is going to have surgery. The doctors says that because he is so young and his body is still not able to fight the virus back; they would need to perform surgery. I need to know if the surgery would be a success.","Doctor":"I would pray that it is a success, but there is no way for me to actually give you statistics or a guarantee of any kind, since you have provided sketchy details and the diagnosis is not clear. I think it might be better to speak to the child's surgeon before the surgery, and after it as well, since he/she would be the most qualified professional to answer your specific query."},{"Patient":"Hello.  I have a three year daughter who has started having nosebleeds quite often.  She is almost 4 years old and began having the nosebleeds when she turned 3.  I would estimate she's had about 30 nosebleeds since she turned three.  The nosebleeds are always only in her right nostril, never the left nostril.  They usually occur while she is sleeping, but also occur while we are at the grocery store, driving in the car, or while she is at preschool.  They are most times heavy, but stops within  5-10 minutes.  We run her humidifer every day and night and we have begun putting vaseline in her nostril.  We have spoken to her pediatrician several times regarding her nosebleeds, but he indicates no real issues and has suggested saline drops to put inside her nose. Today, the school nurse called me and said she has had three nosebleeds today!  That has never happened before and I am becoming alarmed.  I am not certain what else we can do to prevent the nosebleeds.  Should we be concerned?","Doctor":"You should be taking her to the ENT specialist who will look into the nose to find out the cause of the bleeds. Having said that, sometimes, nosebleeds occur for no discernible reason. I would suggest using decongestant nose drops when she bleeds, and saline drops routinely three to four times a day."},{"Patient":"my 5 year old grandson says he feels weird (that's all he says) when he says this his eyes turn glossy and red just around the outer part of his eyes (looks like he's about to cry), he turns pale looking.  It only last for maybe 30 seconds then he's fine (color and eyes normal)  Can not link it to lack of sleep, exhaustion - it hits him at different times of the day.  Sometimes he will go 3 - 4 days with nothing","Doctor":"This might be what is called absence attacks. It is a form of fits, and the child would just look strange for a few seconds, and then be all right. He needs to be seen by a neurologist urgently."},{"Patient":"My son just turned 2yr of age and he excessively drinks at night and urinates at night to the point of constantly soaking his pants and the bed at least 3x a night. There is no HX of Diabetes in the family and he only does this at night time. He also sweats really bad and I keep it pretty cold in the house. He recently started getting marks that look like big circles all up and down his legs but he doesn't itch them and they go away but come back. Can you please ease my mind a little. I am a nurse and have seen a lot so I am very nervous and worried.","Doctor":"Compulsive polydipsia comes to mind. There is no diabetes or kidney problem in this condition, and the child just seems to WANT to drink more fluids. The other problems that you have mentioned seem to be unrelated to this drinking and urinating problem. Excessive sweating can be a sign of vitamin D deficiency, but can also occur with significant heart conditions. The marks that he is getting on the legs - are they painful? It would be a good idea to send the photos of these marks to someone here through a paid query, so that diagnosis is easier.I am afraid that is the best I can do with this question. Do take him to a pediatrician for a complete evaluation. He is too young to go for counselling, but you can begin to gradually restrict his fluid intake after sundown. Also, wake him up after 1 1/2 to 2 hours after he goes to bed and make him go to the loo. This will reduce the problem of bed-wetting over time."},{"Patient":"My 2 year old toddler just this past week started getting red spots that look like mosquito bites(they aren't).  She gets one spot flaring up at a time.  It will start to fade a bit, look less angry, and then we will check her and find another one, either on her face or back.  Has only been about 6 in all over a 5 day period, and they don't seem to bother her at all.  Haven't changed soaps/food, or anything like that.  Have no idea what to make of it, or if it is worth a trip to see a doctor?  She did run a fever for one day last week, and she has a new tooth that JUST broke through, probably ion the last 24 hours.","Doctor":"Red spots can be due to umpteen reasons, including allergies, which you seem to have already taken into account. Other causes include contact allergy, viruses, bacterial skin infections, blood spots due to platelet deficiency, etc. A visit to her doctor is definitely worth it - but you should do it when the spots are actually visible. Just do one thing at home: see if the spot turns white under a transparent glass - if it does, it may be a mosquito bite, a virus, or even an allergy. If it doesn't, it means other things like a bacterial infection, etc."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, my wife is in 5th month of pregnancy.

However, it seems that you are using it even when there is no fever. Stop using it by the clock, and use it only if there is fever above 99.5 degrees F.Why did the fever occur? Most likely a virus, but it is safer to go to his pediatrician in routine hours within a day if possible.Use sponging as a tool to reduce fever - as your child had a fit in the past, don't allow the fever to rise beyond 100 F.I hope that helps.Best wishes.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"my seven year old daughter has been complaining off and on of a stomache ache for the last few weeks.

She is a human, not a leaky fawcet. Having said that, it appears that she has a virus that has affected her chest/respiratory system as well as her skin, and the gut. You should keep treating her symptomatically. Give her paracetamol for fever, benadryl for cold, plenty of fluids including hot chicken soup, and a light diet - as much as she wants. Allow her to decide her activity level. Neither force her to move nor to sleep. Encourage her to play and do interesting things to avoid getting her from being bored and tired.

This is a by-product of bile that is secreted by the liver into the gut. Presence of stercobilin in stool means that she is fine and there is no blockage in her bile system.I said this because pale stools and presence of jaundice in a small baby (which is not the case with her) can mean a serious blockage or underdevelopment of her bile system.

Is it healthy enough for her to eat cerelac only twice a day? She drinks around 18 ounces of milk and 2 servings of cerelac everyday. Is it good enough?Plz do reply im really worried","Doctor":"This reflects the baby's learned choice. To remedy this, you have to make her unlearn her choice by adding small amounts of salt to her Cerelac feeds till she gets used to a salty taste. The other option would be to stop Cerelac completely and get her off it. In those two days or so, you should sustain her on milk alone.

Does she feel breathless when she runs around or plays with other kids?4. Are the symptoms when there are seasonal changes?5. Is there any family history of asthma or any other sort of allergies like skin allergy etc.?6. Is the cough always associated with fever?If your answer is yes for any of the above questions, your kid might be having viral associated wheezing or multi triggered wheezing and I suggest you meet a paediatric pulmonologist who is near your place. Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Health care magic are welcome.

I was thinking probably he got it in the guinea pig or dust in the floor/carpet since he like to play alot laying down...","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.By what you quote it should be an urticarial or a simple skin allergy. You can use Hydroxyzine at 1-2mg/kg/dose every 6th to 8th hourly for 7-10 days. Most important thing to be remembered is that it has a propensity to recur (called as second crop) within 10-14 days. If this happens, you can start using the same medicine but I suggest you get the kid evaluated with your paediatrician.Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

She falls into scratching fits and cannot sleep. Her lymph nodes on the back of her neck and under her ears are very swollen. This has been going on for about 5 months now. Originally she had bad eczema and although switching formula put an end to it. The nodes are still very swollen and the itching is intense at night. What is particularly interesting is that benadryl doesnt reduce the itching at all.","Doctor":"Hi... I sympathize with the kid and understand your concern.  The trick of the management is keeping the skin moist and never allowing it to be dry. For this oil massage and lotions like Oilatum will help. Regarding cure options - eczema is a sort of allergy...allergies can only be controlled and can never be cured. But usually kids grow out of it...that is as the age progresses, they become better starting from 6 months.Oral anti allergic medications are shown to be very effective in this. The swollen lymphnodes could be due to eczema and scratching.Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

When it does start feeling better, I always have slight cramps that I can feel and a tenderness. I go to the bathroom, not alot, but I go. My bowels are very hard. I take quite a bit of medicine for my bi-polar which some of the side effects are constipation . I will take Lactulose every day but nothing gets rid of this cramping. When it gets severe, I end up in bed with a heating pad . I am almost unable to stand and walk around the pain is so bad. In the last year I have had a colonoscopy - everything was fine except my bowels were really kinky. I just know something is wrong, I feel it. It is always there. I am so tired of this. I also have Hep C . Have had that for 26 years. My ankles, knees and hands have become so swollen and I now have that liver rash all over my ankles and legs. I don t know what to do.","Doctor":"Hello, clmiltimore, You tell us that you have been diagnosed with Hep-C for 26 years. Only after 1992 we have had good screening tests for Hep-C. Now in the past ten years and more recently, in the past couple of years, we have very effective treatment to cure Hep-C. I am not sure if you are currently being treated for that. On eof the known side effects of Interferon that is used to treat is depression. If that becomes a major problem then they have to be under care of a psychitrist to monitor while on treatment for Hep-C. Some of the antidepressants have side effects and the major is constipation. You tell us that you have been using lactulose and still having problems. Lactulose can give more bloating and gas and more so if someone has lactose intolerance. What you could do, is to try MiraLax (Peg solution) or similar and follow the instructions on the label. This works well. When you start having dirrhea, you can cut back the dosage. Also, make sure you are on a high fiber diet and drink plenty of fluids. If you have swollen ankles and feet, you may be retaining water. If your abdomen is swollen , you may have fluid in the belly from cirrhosis of the liver from chronic hepatitis. You need to have complete blood tests, including blood count, coagulation studies, liver tests, electrolytes,kidney tests. Also, I recommend that you get a sonogram of the liver and abdomen to look for changes of cirrhosis. You might need aggressive treatment with good close medical supervision. I wish you well."},{"Patient":"My son is almost 3 and in the last 6 months he has had random fevers (just 3) no other symptoms. but his sister has panhypopituitarism .And she has random fevers all the timeit just scares me. He shows no signs of having this weight is high 99 %tile height is 99%tile am I worried over nothing? Please help Nikki","Doctor":"Hi...by what you quote I feel that it could be recurrent viral illness which he is experiencing. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My son is 15 months. He was suggested augmentin dds and nutrolin B for 5 days, when he had ear infection [fluid in the ear] after cold n cough. But my bad, i missed to give him nutrolin B alongwith augmentin for 3 days. So he developed rashes in his bums and areas around. Now I started giving nutrolin B with augmentin dds. Is it ok, or would he have anyother side effects? Pl advice.","Doctor":"Hi...the rash around the anus could be due to the loose stools he might be having due to the antibiotic which is quite expected. This is not because you have not used Nutrolin-B concurrently. You need not feel bad about it.For the peri-anal excoriation and rash you can use - emollient ointment which should settle the issue. I prefer and prescribe Siloderm ointment as external application around the anal region.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My 2yr old grandaughter has always had trouble wth constipation and has been under her famly doctor, she has been taking medicine for quiet a while.

The best treatment options for Giardiasis is - tinidazole, metronidazole, or nitazoxanide. Patients with giardiasis should be counseled to avoid lactose-containing foods for at least one month after therapy. Treatment is not usually recommended for asymptomatic individuals. However, treatment may be warranted to prevent the spread of infection if a patient is a household contact of a pregnant woman, an immunocompromised individual (especially in the setting of hypogammaglobulinemia), or a child in a day-care or other setting who might transmit infection to others.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My four month old fell off bed yesterday afternoon. He was acting normal till this morning he has been very fussy. He seemed to have slight fever. Had a bottle at 9 this morning. He has been a bit stuffy in his sinus and constipated. I wonder if his fussyness is from this rather than the fall.","Doctor":"Hi... the fussiness might not be related to the fall. First be reassured that your kid is normal. I will suggest you danger signs of head injury -1. Vomiting continuously2. Seizures3. Watery of bloody discharge from ears and nose4. Unconsciousness5. Altered sensorium or behaviour. If none of them are present, I don't think you should worry about his trivial head injury.

Also in the last month I have noticed his knuckles have become swollen and the skin has gone all funny.","Doctor":"Hi...I do not think that his tonsillitis is related to his knuckles swelling. The knuckles swelling might be related to a vasculitis or connective tissue disorder. I suggest you consult a pediatrician or a pediatric rheumatologist for this. Antibiotics are not an answer for this. The kid definitely requires evaluation for Juvenile rheumatoid Arthritis.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"I noticed yesterday when I picked my one year old up after taking a nap his bottom lip was quivering.

He has hypercalcimia however his levels were just checked and they are fine. What could this be? Megan","Doctor":"Hi...by what you quote I feel that this quivering of lips and clenching of fists are related to calcium metabolism itself. But the test should have been taken when he has the symptoms and rather than total calcium - ionized calcium is more important. I suggest if this is recurring you get back to the nearest emergency room.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have a bloating pressure feeling inside of my vagina .

Because your sister was diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer,you too have to be investigated. Increased frequency of urination may be due to Urinary tract infection.Pressure in the vagina may be due to infection in it or from surrounding structures. Appendicitis,Right Ureteric colic and Right Ovarian pathology has to be ruled out by routine investigations like Ultrasound abdomen. Consult your local doctor.

How my baby get normal kidney function on left kidney?","Doctor":"Hi...an ultrasound scan doesn't tell you about the function of the kidney. You need a DMSA scan for this. a 2 days baby having a dilated pelvicalyceal system means that it is an antenatal hydronehphrosis. Many of these get better by themselves.

An active is a well kid even if she/ he is not eating well. 2. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone.3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day.4. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.5.

Nothing to worry about it. I guess you would have done this after she developed some loose stools. It seems your kid is having viral diarrhoea. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do.

Learning to deal with frustration is a skill that children gain over time. Tantrums are common during the second year of life, a time when language skills are starting to develop. Because toddlers can't yet say what they want, feel, or need, a frustrating experience may cause a tantrum. As language skills improve, tantrums tend to decrease. This is what you can do to avoid or prevent tantrums - 1. Give plenty of positive attention2. Try to give kud some control over little things3. Keep off-limits objects out of sight and out of reach4. Distract your child5. Help kids learn new skills and succeed6. Consider the request carefully when your child wants something7.

Upper abdominal pain has rather nothing to do with large intestine disease (if no bowels obstruction). Such pain can be caused by gallstones or pancreas disease. That is why, what you should have performed at first before any endoscopy is abdominal ultrasound, full blood work, liver tests (AST,ALT,GGP), amylase, bilirubin, urine analysis, abdominal X-ray. If gallstones are causing your pain, hot bath should ease it as well as soft muscle relaxing medicines. Hope this will help Regards."},{"Patient":"My son is 6 years, 8 months old.

Thank you for the query. Neither CT scan or chest X-ray wont visualize gallstones. And your symptoms should be checked with it, as this is the most often reason of such symptoms.
