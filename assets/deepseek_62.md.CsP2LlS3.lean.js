Read and understood that you have pain in the right side of abdomen and the lower chest, you Doctor has opined that it is due to anxiety. Yes, this looks to be a costo-chondritis wherein there is inflammation of the cartilage part of the ribs. The cause are post-viral flupost -infective pathology like Enteric fever.Most of the patients already suffer from IBS and some psychosomatic problems. I would suggest you the following:-Rest to the area by means of strapping with the Adhesive tapes during the deep Expiration phase. This will limit the movement, reduce the pain and give rest for healing to occur.-Anti-inflammatory medicines in full dose as per the weight.-Steroids if required for its strong anti-inflammatory role.-Diuretics to reduced the edema.-Control of stress and anxiety helps a lot.-Local rubrafacient liniments if the area is not covered by strapping. -Confirmation of the diagnosis by local Doctor on palpation and clinical evaluation and to get prescription based medicines after discussing the above points."},{"Patient":"I have been having lower right abdominal pain the past two days.

The pain in these fingers only shows that your median nerve is compressing somewhere.  If it is only involving the area below the wrist, then it is most likely carpal tunnel syndrome. Does your pain get severe or appear when you flex your wrist for some time like half a minute or so? If so, then you need a nerve conduction study which will confirm it. And for that you need to exercise your wrist in a way that flex it for few second, then extend it for few seconds. Keep doing it at least 10 times for 3 times a day or more if possible. Avoid activities which involves rotation of wrist joint like cooking etc. You may need some drugs like pain killer or gabapentin etc. If it is severe, then surgery may be advised.Hope i answered your question.

A urinary tract infection  is a common cause of frequent urination and this is the first thing to think of. An overactive bladder is another common cause but usually seen on elderly,although it may be seen in youngs as well. Overactive bladder is usually a collection of symptoms that can lead to frequent urination. These include: urinary urgency, or the sudden urge to urinate, caused by muscle contraction, urge incontinence, or loss of bladder control. Excessive caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol may also irritate the bladder walls and can worsen frequent urination symptoms. Treatment for frequent urination depends on the cause. Your doctor will first treat the primary disease responsible for frequent urination, such as diabetes. If an infection is at fault, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics for getting rid of the infection. Medications that control the muscle spasms in the bladder can help reduce urinary incontinence, or loss of bladder control. Your doctor also may suggest doing pelvic exercises, such as Kegels or bladder retraining exercises, to help delay urination. Hope I have answered your query.

What I make out from your complaint is that you have a amputation and now you are having shooting pain.Generally shooting pain is classically associated with neuromas after amputation.

The pain grew in intensity, and soon it was a shooting pain that started in the lower right quadrant and went to just below my belly button. The pain is intermittent, and sometimes goes away for up to an hour. The pain initially felt digestive but then began to get worse with certain movement- including moving my right leg or turning on my left side. It is more painful when pressure is applied but not necessarily on rebound. The pain started on Tuesday and grew in intensity to the point that I scheduled an urgent DR appointment on Thursday. The doctor felt that it was appendicitis- although that it was not acute appendicitis. She ordered an urgent CT scan but said they might not get me in for a few days. She told me if the pain got worse or I broke out in a fever. The pain worsened and I ended up in the ER the next day. They ran a CT scan (I believe with contrast) and it came back unremarkable. Same for an ultrasound. Blood tests came back normal except for slightly elevated lymphocytes. Urine tests were also normal. Slight fever at 99.5 (which is high for me since I usually run cold at 97.3). I went back for a follow up the next day to a different DR and he shrugged it off and maintained the tests didn t show anything and that it was probably a virus. The pain is worse today, one week later. It hurts to touch anywhere near the area. The pain is continuing to shoot through my abdomen- NSAIDS do a little but not much. They gave me tylenol 3 and that just makes me sleepy but still in pain. I ve read other similar stories and many people ended up having appendicitis but it was chronic instead of acute and didn t show up on CT scans either- it was only found and their pain resolved after surgery. Other past symptoms: - IBS like symptoms (including a couple bouts of bloody diarrhea- these were explained away by my DR at the time as being due to constipation before the diarrhea causing tears inside the intestine or colon) - GERD and possibly Bile reflux as well - rapid heart rate - a previous long period with a low grade fever (around 99.5-100.0 for approximately 1-1/2 months). - A familial history of Mitochondrial Disease on the MtDNA- I m at 75% affected cells but only show minor symptoms.

The causes can be mild or seriously life-threatening because they include the heart, lungs and surrounding muscles.

Hypertension is known as the “silent killer.” The symptoms are usually not obvious; however, it can lead to damage to the heart, brain, kidneys and eyes, and can even lead to stroke and kidney failure. Bradycardia - The heart rate is slowed from 72 beats per minute, which is normal, to below 60 beats per minute in an adult. Tachycardia - The heart rate is sped up to above 100 beats per minute in an adult. Normal adult heart rate is 72 beats per minute. ECG Abnormal - A test called an electrocardiogram (ECG) records the activity of the heart. It measures heartbeats as well as the position and size of the heart’s four chambers. It also measures if there is damage to the heart and the effects of drugs or mechanical devices like a pacemaker on the heart.

Sometimes there is pain, twitching, jerking, cramping, burning, or a creepy-crawly sensation associated with the movements. It worsens when a person is inactive, and can interrupt sleep so one feels the need to move to gain some relief. Shaking - Uncontrolled quivering and trembling as if one is cold and chilled.

This is a sensitive area so that should explain the pain. Along with icing and paracetamol, apply creams for decreasing swelling available as Reparil gel or anything similar.

I have slight weakness in my left arm and slight tingling in my legs but no shaking. I did have gastro a week a go so I was thinking it could be Gullian Bare syndrome? But that has even weakness doesn’t it and also tingling which I don’t have? Also I’m having muscle wasting all over my body like in my legs too and idk if that is caused by it? Doctors did urine sample and blood tests and all came back fine also had a basic neurological exam (they tapped me with this metal thing and did a strength test) and I got 5 for strength and didn’t have any hyperflexia but my left arms still feels a little weak like holding my phone. Also have lost 5kgs in like a week even though my diet is healthy and appetite is fine. The doc I spoke to said I can’t lose muscle that quickly so she thinks I’m not losing muscle, is that true? Sometimes I get really overcome with general fatigue especially when my body gets hot and later in the afternoon. That makes me think it could be MS but MS doesn’t cause muscle wasting and atrophy does it?? Correct me if I’m wrong! I’ve got an MRI scheduled for next week. Would that rule out ALS? I calculated the odds and it’s like 1 in 1 million of me having ALS due to my age but you never know?? Also does the onset of muscle atrophy in als happen really quickly like visible muscle wasting in the hands occurring daily? Lastly it’s expensive to go to the doctor in my country and just those simple tests cost 700 and the MRI would be another 600 so like that plays a role too and I’m a student so my parents are paying.

I knew this couldn t be appendicitis because mine had been removed years ago plus the location]was wrong. In the hospital ER a CAT scan was performed which confirmed the attending physician s initial suspicion plus a surgeon had already been called in. It ended up that the right side of my bowels had totally flipped over to the left side, there were pockets of septis (?) & a large mass of impacted dry fecal matter needed removal. Eight inches of my bowels were removed & reconnected but at least I don t have a colostomy. I came home from hospital today with 23 staples which needed to stay a few extra days because I needed a dose of steroids due to major breathing issues after the anesthetic. My questions are: How common is something like this? Over the years I would have MAJOR pain which could bring me to the ER yet nothing would be discovered - even once after exploratory surgery. Could this have been my bowels having flipped out of place before but then flipping back in place again? All those years of agonizing pain leading up to the straw that broke the camel s back ! & can something like this happen again? The surgeon said I came this close to things rupturing whatever that may mean.

I am a 20 year old male with a strange condition and its a bit descriptive. Your help will be very valuable to me. So let me start. I was a smoker once. I used to smoke Marijuana from about July 2013 and left smoking after February 2014. I also smoked cigaretes from about December 2013 to February 2014. The reason I quit smoking was because I had a very bad hangover after smoking marijuana. When I was high I was thinking if it could kill me and all of a sudden I thought I am going to die and my heartbeat raced and I was full of fear, It might have been a panic attack but I thought it was a heart attack and I became restless and started running and splashing my face with water, I was terrified. after few hours I was normal but my fear remained for about 2 days and after that i became completely normal. Few weeks later(in march 15 approximately) at night I had a slightly sharp pain in my upper left abdomen and I thought it was a heart attack and I had another episode of that panic but this time it lasted only for a minute(may be even less and might have been due to gas) but after this episode I got very depressed thinking that I might have developed a heart condition or lung problem or even stomach cancer. I used to remain depressed all day and was also frightened at the same time for about a week. I used to search the internet about everything that could have caused it. After a week my paranoia reduced but was not completely gone. I had my exams that week and after the exams were over my paranoia reduced but was still there to cause me stress. after few months during my next exams my stress returned with a vengeance and I used to feel headache and inactive all day and I thought that I still might have some disease related to smoking and after the exams were over the symptoms were all gone. It has been almost 5 months now since that panic episode. but whenever I get mild chest pain mainly due to gas or mild heartburn I get anxious. Is there a way out? I know that I have no serious condition cause I didn t get any check-up after that episode and in these few months more symptoms should have appeared. Your help will be highly appreciated.

In this case one option is remaining i.e. allogeneic stem cell transplantation — stem cell transplantation from a suitable donor — is the only treatment that has the potential to cure myelofibrosis. But it also has a high risk of life-threatening side effects.Many people with myelofibrosis, because of age, stability of the disease or other health problems, don't qualify for this treatment.Prior to a stem cell transplant, also called a bone marrow transplant, you receive very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your diseased bone marrow. Then you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor.After the procedure, there's a risk that the new stem cells will react against your body's healthy tissues, causing potentially fatal damage (graft-versus-host disease). Other risks include organ or blood vessel damage, cataracts, and the development of a different cancer later on.so palliative care is done for on going symptoms.

It feels somewhat like fiberglass irritation although I have had no exposure to fiberglass.  This started some months ago, and was only felt when my bare skin was resting on my desk or table. Now the sensation is more frequent and more intensified.  Pressure of any kind or from clothing touching my forearm will aggravate the sensation.  Any ideas?","Doctor":"Hello! Welcome to HealthcareMagic! Irritation in forearm may occur either due to-  1. Brachioradial Pruritus: Brachioradial pruritus can make you feel itchy, tingling or stinging or a changed sensation on the skin of either or both armsor forearm. Brachioradial pruritus develops due to damage to nerves in the cervical spine (neck). This may be caused by: a) Cervical spine tumors b) Cervical rib c) Compression of the nerves d) Cervical vertebral osteoarthritis e) Other spinal cord conditions. Continuous pressure on the spinal neurons conveying itch impulses can activate sensitization processes. When nerves transmitting light touch and pinprick sensations are over-stimulated, the patient may develop sensitive or sore skin, with intense responses to touch and pain (conditions known respectively as hyperesthesia and hyperalgesia). Brachioradial pruritus will typically affect one particular area of the skin (a dermatome), but may spread to other regions. The condition is more common in sunnier climates, as prolonged exposure to sunlight may harm nerve fibers in the skin. Brachioradial pruritus is usually diagnosed by taking a biopsy of a small piece of skin. This is then examined under a microscope, and doctors may see reduced skin tissue (skin atrophy) and damaged nerves. 2. Other Causes: a) Eczema- is a long-term non-infectious condition resulting in itchy inflamed skin, which gets worse at night. Eczema can develop anywhere, but is most frequent behind the knees and on the arms. It appears as red, dry and cracked patches, and you may see fluid-filled bumps on the skin. b) Lichen planus -is a chronic non-infectious inflammatory skin ailment. Patients usually get itchy forearms and inner wrists. There may be groups of lesions that are purple-colored, flat, have defined borders, and are covered with white lines, known as Wickham striae. The skin may look shiny and become scaly. c) Contact dermatitis- is a common skin condition caused by contact with irritants or allergens. It appears as an itchy rash, and you may also experience blisters, red bumps, thick scaly skin, and soreness in the affected region. d) Ringworm infection- appears as a circular itchy rash that is inflamed and reddened at the borders and normal skin-colored in the center. The rash is usually raised, and you may experience sores and blisters. Ringworm infection is very contagious. Hives is a common non-infectious condition with a welt-like rash, which may be extensive. The rash is red or pink, with raised itchy spots, and can last anything from a day up to 6 weeks. The itching can be intense, and occasionally patients experience burning or stinging. e) Certain drugs -may cause some people to develop itchy skin rashes, either as an allergic reaction to or as a side effect of the medicine. f) You may also notice red spots propagating all over the body, scaly or thick skin, and shortness of breath. Shingles affects previous sufferers of chickenpox, caused by the herpes zoster virus. When the virus becomes reactivated, patients feel tingling, pain and numbness. Above all may be the possible causes of irritation in forearm but exact causes can be diagnosed with proper investigation.

According to your symptoms and findings there is osteoarthritis of your knee.You can start cartilage protecting medication like chondritin sulphate, that you need to take for couple of months.I will advise to do X ray knee and if required MRI knee can be done and if there is severe destruction of menisci then arthroscopic shaving can be done.Physiotherapy like ultrasound and tens will help, along with knee exercises.Life style changes will help in reducing pain which include,LOAD REDUCTION : Protecting the joint from excessive load may slow down the rate of cartilage loss. It is also effective in relieving pain. The heavier you are, the more stress you put on your joints. Weight reduction for obese patients, wearing shock-absorbing shoes, avoiding activities like climbing stairs and using a walking stick are worthwhile.ACTIVITY MODIFICATION -It is important to maintain as much activity and joint motion as possible, but impact activities will aggravate arthritis. Running and jumping will often accelerate cartilage loss from the joint. The key is to focus on low impact activities, such as swimming or cycling.  ANALGESIC MEDICATION : Simple over the counter medications like acetaminophen is sufficient in most cases. If this fails to control pain, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug may be better.   VISCOSUPPLEMENTATION: Hyaluronic acid injections given into the joint (especially large joints like knee joint) in prescribed dosages will give good short term pain relief in arthritic joints ranging from 1-2 years.Hope this answers your query.

Never been injured playing in all that time.","Doctor":"Hi. Thank you for reaching out to Health Care Magic. Common causes of knee pain include the following - Muscle injurySoft tissue strainCone really issueA popliteal muscle strainThe fact that you mention that the knee is locking up may indicate a popliteal muscle issue. This is because the muscle causes the knee to lock after extension of the muscle. One of the best regimen to promote healing of this is usually by using the POLICE regimen. POLICE stands for -Protection - Protect the joint. Prevent injury and avoid excessive exercise. Optimal loading - This is when the muscle is loaded to the right strain and right tension. In this tension, the muscle would heal quicker because the muscle can contract and relax allowing blood to flow smoothlyIcing the area for 15 mins at a time can be very useful for allowing healing and to reduce swellingCompression - Using a knee sleeve for some part of the day may helpElevation of the leg while lying down or sleeping can help with recovery by pushing blood back to the heart. Along with this, many people find using OTC NSAIDs useful to reduce the swelling. Also, using a hot compress may help as well. I hope this helps.

The fascia lies directly beneath the skin on the bottom of your foot and connects your heel bone to your toes. The diagnosis is made after clinical examination of your foot and  X-ray may be ordered to rule out other causes of foot pain. Usually proper life style modifications and simple conservative treatment helps to cure the majority of patients with plantar fasciitis. The treatment includes the followings:-avoid activities that makes pain worse such running or other activities that put high pressure on foot. -you can continue putting ice or bio-freeze for 15-20 mins 3 times a day.-use splints at night to make the fascia relaxed. Night splints makes toes pointed up and applies a constant, gentle stretch to the plantar fascia. It also stretches the Achilles tendon at the back of the heel, preventing it from contracting. Night splints can be used every night until the pain is gone. -you can browse the internet or ask your doctor about special exercises for plantar fasciitis.-your doctor may also prescribe non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs or inject corticosteroids in the fascia if the pain is severe.Usually majority of patients improve within 6 months with the conservative treatment. Surgical treatment can be considered only after 12 months of unsuccessful non-surgical treatment. I hope the above information will be helpful for you.

(usually walk )The calf seems to get better but there is still swelling and black and blue on the foot. It has less discomfort and I have a push off getting better","Doctor":"hi sir/madam,Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.The possible cause for your discoloration is VENOUS STASIS DERMATITIS.Brown discoloration that forms on the lower part of the leg, usually around the ankle, can be attributed to a skin condition known as venous stasis dermatitis. This inflammatory skin disorder is actually caused by problems with the veins underneath the skin’s surface. When the veins don’t work properly, blood and fluids can leak out of the veins and cause skin discoloration.Venous stasis dermatitis often begins with minor irritation and itchiness of the skin in the affected area. Over time, the skin will start to thin and look more translucent. If the problem is not addressed at this point, the skin can become discolored and take on a thick, leathery texture. Unfortunately, these final symptoms are often permanent, even if the underlying vein disorder is properly treated.When venous stasis dermatitis is diagnosed, the treatment is focused on addressing the diseased vessels and restoring healthy blood flow. This can be done through a variety of minimally-invasive procedures that collapse the affected vein so that it can be reabsorbed by the body. With the vein eliminated, blood naturally reroutes to healthier vessels nearby.If you have discoloration around the lower part of the leg, make an appointment with a vein specialist to get an accurate diagnosis and treatment option. This is particularly true if your discoloration is accompanied by symptoms like leg pain and heaviness or swelling of the lower extremity. The sooner you treat the vein condition, the fewer complications you will experience. Hope i was helpful.Have a healthy day."},{"Patient":"Awoke to pain in my left hand only.

Possible causes are-1. Poor Hip Mobility:-With every step we take our hip and pelvis move in three planes of motion.  If we have any lack of motion in our hip it will cause the spine to move more than it is designed to move.  Overtime this increased motion can begin to create inflammation and compression of the nerves that exit the spine.  This leads to sciatica and lower back pain.2. Limited Foot and Ankle Mobility:-Every time our foot hits the ground when we are walking studies demonstrate that the body needs to absorb 2-3 times our body weight in forces.  Those forces end up traveling up into the spine. If the foot is stiff and does not flatten when we walk like it is designed to do it will cause an increase in forces transmitted into the spine.  The increased forces cause increased compression and can irritate the joints and nerves in the spine.3. Decreased Hip Strength:-It is very common to see people walking with a slight lead to one side when the foot lands on the ground.  This is an indicator that the lateral part of the hip is weak (glute medius).  When this happens, the body compensates by leaning to that side.  When the body leans to that side is causes compression of the nerves on the same side of the spine.4. Stiff Upper Back:-With every step we take we also have an arm swing in the opposite direction. This arm swing causes our upper back to rotate.  If we have limited upper back rotation it will cause increase rotation in the lower back.  This increased rotation can lead to increased compression and irritation to the joints and nerves in the spine.5. Stenosis or Arthritis in the spine:-Research indicates that if you are over 55 years old, have pain in your lower back with walking or standing and it goes away when you sit, there is a 97% chance you have arthritis in your spine. This arthritis predisposes you to have pain with walking in your spine.  If you fix all of the things we have mentioned earlier then you can walk without pain even when you have stenosis or arthritis in the spine.  Don’t let it be an excuse.  Just know it is one of the 5 reasons why your back may hurt when you walk.Hope it was helpful.Stay healthy,Stay safe."},{"Patient":"This is going to sound crazy.

I do not have diabeties but I am 100 lbs overweight. Should I look at Congestive heart syndrome or Kidney failure ? And what testing should I recieve ?","Doctor":"Hi there, your doubts are valid to a certain extent. In case of both lower limb involvement of swelling one of the few disorders one needs to look into are those of the heart, kidney and the liver.With regards to the heart there is poor inflow of the blood from the veins and that causes pooling and extravasation of fluid which leads to edema and swelling. In case of liver and kidney problems it mainly is related to the low blood albumin levels which lead on to disturbed osmotic balance in the body. There are specific tests available for each for which you need to visit your doctor before you get them done because these diagnoses require a good physical examination before any tests can be further ordered. Also an important cause could be abdominal tumors. But i would suggest you get the required investigations done before jumping to conclusions."},{"Patient":"Numbness in left foot with tingling.
