First, we recognize that the modulus of a product is the product of the moduli, which gives us:   |zcdot (1+i)| = |z|cdot |1+i|.2. We know that |1+i| can be calculated using the formula for the modulus of a complex number, |a+bi| = sqrt{a^2+b^2}. Thus, for 1+i, we have:   |1+i| = sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{2}.3. Substituting the value of |1+i| back into our equation, we get:   sqrt{2}|z| = 2.4. Solving for |z|, we divide both sides by sqrt{2} to find:   |z| = frac{2}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2}.5. The modulus of a complex number z, denoted |z|, is equal to sqrt{z cdot overline{z}}. Since we have found |z| = sqrt{2}, we square both sides to eliminate the square root, obtaining:   |z|^2 = (sqrt{2})^2 = 2.6.

Each of the numbers m_{1}, cdots, m_{n} and a-1 is a power of 2.Proof of Lemma 1. Let i in{1, cdots, n} and gamma be an odd divisor of m_{i} (possibly gamma=1), say m_{i}=gamma times b. Let p be a prime divisor of a^{gamma}-1.Since a^{gamma} equiv 1(bmod p), we have a^{m_{i}} equivleft(a^{gamma}right)^{b} equiv 1(bmod p).Thus A is divisible by p, which ensures that there exists j such that a^{k_{j}}+1 is divisible by p. As above, we then have left(a^{gamma}right)^{k_{j}}-1 equiv 0(bmod p) and, since gamma is odd, we also have left(a^{k_{j}}right)^{gamma} equiv-1 (bmod p).Hence p divides left(left(a^{k_{j}}right)^{gamma}+1right)-left(left(a^{gamma}right)^{k_{j}}-1right)=2, so p=2.Thus, the only prime divisor of a^{gamma}-1 is p=2, which proves that a^{gamma}-1 is a power of 2. There exists an integer c such that2^{c}=a^{gamma}-1=(a-1)left(a^{gamma-1}+cdots+a+1right) .In particular, a-1 is therefore a power of 2 and a is odd. But, since gamma is odd, a^{gamma-1}+cdots+a+1 is odd and must also be a power of 2. This implies that gamma=1 and thus that the only odd divisor of m_{i} is 1, which concludes the proof of Lemma 1.From the lemma, we have a-1=2^{c} and a-1>2, so a-1 is divisible by 4. For any integer k geq 0, we then have a^{k}+1 equiv 2(bmod 4).For all i, we set a_{i}=frac{1}{2}left(a^{2^{i}}+1right). We know that a_{i} is an odd integer.We easily verify by induction that, for any integer d geq 0 :a^{2^{d}}-1=(a-1)(a+1)left(a^{2}+1right) cdotsleft(a^{2^{d-1}}+1right)=2^{c} cdot 2^{d} cdot a_{0} a_{1} cdots a_{d-1}Lemma 2. The numbers a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots are pairwise coprime.Proof of Lemma 2. Let 0 leq iN_{0}+cdots N_{q}. Since each a^{k_{j}}+1 is congruent to 2 modulo 4, we must therefore have s=N. For all j, if we set k_{j}=2^{r} t with t odd, then a^{k_{j}}+1=left(a^{2^{r}}right)^{t}+1 equiv(-1)^{t}+1 equiv 0 (bmod 2)^{r}+1. Thus a^{k_{j}}+1 is divisible by a_{r}.Thus, each of the numbers a^{k_{j}}+1 is divisible by one of the a_{i}. Since s>N_{0}+cdots N_{q}, there exists i for which a_{i} divides more than N_{i} of the a^{k_{j}}+1. Hence, A is divisible by left(a_{i}right)^{N_{i}+1}, which is impossible according to (2), since a_{i} is odd and coprime with each of the other a_{j} according to Lemma 2."},{"problem":"5.

We therefore have one such piece for every corner, and it is simple to see there are only two configurations possible:![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_28_5d50c375e30aaac9179ag-21.jpg?height=412&width=1008&top_left_y=1161&top_left_x=570)After removing these 4 pieces, we are now left with a (2 n-1) times(2 n-1) square in the middle, which has to be subdivided exactly like in the initial problem statement (for n-1 instead of n ). Iterating the same argument should give us the answer 2^{n}. We prove this more formally with induction.Induction hypothesis: There are exactly 2^{k} possibilities to cover the (2 k+1) times(2 k+1)-square. Base case: For n=1 we have the 2=2^{1} possibilities described above for the border. The remaining area is exactly the 1 times 1 square, which means we don't get more possibilities.Induction step: By the reasoning above, We first choose one of two possibilities for the border of the (2 n+1) times(2 n+1)-square and end up with a (2 n-1) times(2 n-1)-square in the middle, which can be covered in 2^{n-1} different ways by the induction hypothesis for k=n-1. Since we can combine both possibilities for the border with all possibilities of the interior, we obtain 2 cdot 2^{n-1}=2^{n} possibilities in total.This proves that 2^{n} is indeed the answer."},{"problem":"What integer is equal to 1^{1}+2^{2}+3^{3} ?","solution":"Since 1^{1}=1,2^{2}=4, and 3^{3}=27, then 1^{1}+2^{2}+3^{3}=1+4+27=32.ANSWER: 32"},{"problem":"section*{Problem 4 - 091024}Which of the following conditions (1), ..., (5) is equivalent to the condition (3 x^{2}+6 x>9)?(1) (-3-3)(3) (x-3)(5) (x>1) or (x<-3) )","solution":"}The following inequalities are equivalent to the given one[begin{aligned}x^{2}+2 x-3 & >0 (x+1)^{2} & >4 (x+1)^{2}-2^{2} & >0 (x-1)(x+3) & >0end{aligned}]By case analysis, we obtain that the last condition is equivalent to: (x>1) or (x<-3).

Under this condition, the system of equations transforms as follows:y^{2}=x z ; quad z^{2}=x y ; quad x^{2}=y z ; quad text { and } quad x+y+z=0From the condition, we have y=-x-z, so y^{2}=x^{2}+2 x z+z^{2}=x z, which simplifies to x^{2}+x z+z^{2}=0. This can only be true for real numbers if x=z=0, from which it follows that y=0 as well. Thus, the only possible solution when x+y+z=0 is x=y=z=0, and this is indeed a solution to the system (1).For the rest of the analysis, we assume that x+y+z neq 0. Subtract the second equation from the first, the third from the second, and the first from the third. We then get the following equations:begin{aligned}y^{2}-z^{2}+x y-x z & =(a-b)(x+y+z)^{2} z^{2}-x^{2}+y z-x y & =(b-c)(x+y+z)^{2} x^{2}-y^{2}+x z-y z & =(c-a)(x+y+z)^{2}end{aligned}After factoring and dividing by x+y+z neq 0:begin{aligned}& y-z=(a-b)(x+y+z) & z-x=(b-c)(x+y+z) & x-y=(c-a)(x+y+z)end{aligned}Let's choose the value of x+y+z as a parameter and denote it by 3s. Using this, we can express the values of x, y, and z as follows:begin{aligned}& x+y+z=3s & y-z=3(a-b)s & z-x=3(b-c)s & x-y=3(c-a)send{aligned}By adding the first equation to the fourth and subtracting the third, we get the value of x. Similarly, we can find the values of y and z by adding or subtracting the appropriate equations:begin{aligned}& x=(2c-a-b+1)s & y=(2a-b-c+1)s & z=(2b-c-a+1)send{aligned}Thus, if the system (1) has solutions other than x=y=z=0, they are given by (3). Let's check when (3) is a solution to the original system of equations (assuming s neq 0).

The two sides will only be equal ifa^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}-(ab+bc+ca)-(a+b+c)=0It is easy to see that if condition (4) is satisfied, the other equations are also satisfied by (3). If condition (4) is satisfied, then (3) provides all solutions, including the solution x=y=z=0, which is obtained when s=0.In summary, if (4) is not satisfied, the only solution to the system of equations is x=y=z=0.

Estimate the number of blue glass balls in the bag.","solution":"Given that the total number of glass balls in the bag is 80, and the frequency of picking a yellow glass ball stabilized at around 0.25, we can estimate the number of blue glass balls as follows:1. The frequency of picking a yellow glass ball is approximately 0.25. This means that out of every 4 balls picked, on average, 1 is yellow. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:   text{Probability of picking a yellow ball} = 0.252. Since there are only yellow and blue balls in the bag, the probability of picking a blue ball is the complement of picking a yellow ball. Therefore, the probability of picking a blue ball is:   text{Probability of picking a blue ball} = 1 - text{Probability of picking a yellow ball} = 1 - 0.25 = 0.753. To estimate the number of blue glass balls in the bag, we multiply the total number of balls by the probability of picking a blue ball:   text{Estimated number of blue balls} = text{Total number of balls} times text{Probability of picking a blue ball} = 80 times 0.754.

Find the smallest constant c > 0 such that the following holds, no matter the situation in that country:[i]Any citizen of the exotic country that has a finite number of coins, with a total value of no more than 1000, can split those coins into 100 boxes, such that the total value inside each box is at most c.[/i]","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the smallest constant ( c > 0 ) such that any citizen with a finite number of coins, whose total value does not exceed 1000, can split these coins into 100 boxes such that the total value in each box is at most ( c ).2. Initial Consideration:   Consider the case where there are ( n geq 1000 ) coins, each with value ( frac{1000}{n} ). By the Pigeonhole Principle, if we distribute these coins into 100 boxes, at least one box will contain at least ( leftlceil frac{n}{100} rightrceil ) coins.3. Maximizing the Value in a Box:   The total value in a box with ( leftlceil frac{n}{100} rightrceil ) coins is at least:   [   leftlceil frac{n}{100} rightrceil cdot frac{1000}{n}   ]   To maximize this value, let ( n = 100q - r ) where ( q geq 1 ) and ( 0 leq r leq 99 ). We aim to maximize:   [   frac{1000q}{100q - r} = frac{1000}{100 - frac{r}{q}}   ]   This expression is minimized when ( frac{r}{q} ) is minimized. The worst-case scenario occurs when ( r = 99 ) and ( q = 11 ), yielding:   [   frac{1000}{100 - frac{99}{11}} = frac{1000}{100 - 9} = frac{1000}{91}   ]4. Verification for ( c = frac{1000}{91} ):   We need to show that ( c = frac{1000}{91} ) is sufficient. Consider the coins with values exceeding ( frac{1000}{1001} ). There can be at most 1000 such coins, otherwise, their total value would exceed 1000. We can distribute these coins into 100 boxes such that each box contains at most 10 of these coins. Thus, the total value in each box from these coins is at most:   [   10 cdot frac{1000}{1001} = frac{10000}{1001}   ]5. Greedy Algorithm for Remaining Coins:   For the remaining coins, we use a greedy algorithm to place each coin into a box such that the total value in each box does not exceed ( frac{1000}{91} ). If at any point, adding a coin ( x leq frac{1000}{1001} ) to any box would exceed ( frac{1000}{91} ), then:   [   x_i + x > frac{1000}{91} quad text{for all } i = 1, ldots, 100   ]   This implies:   [   x_1 + x_2 + ldots + x_{100} + 100x > frac{10000}{91}   ]   Given that:   [   x_1 + x_2 + ldots + x_{100} + x leq 1000 quad text{and} quad x leq frac{1000}{1001}   ]   We get:   [   frac{10000}{91} < 1000 + 99 cdot frac{1000}{1001} = frac{10000}{91}   ]   This is a contradiction, hence the algorithm can be performed successfully.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ frac{1000}{91} } )"},{"problem":"Jefferson Middle School has the same number of boys and girls. frac{3}{4} of the girls and frac{2}{3}of the boys went on a field trip.

How many positive integers n less than or equal to 100 are divisible by varphi(n) ?","solution":"Answer: 16Solution: We claim that any such integer n must be either equal to 1 or of the form 2^{a} 3^{b}, where a geq 1 and b geq 0.First, we note that if n>1, it must be even. This is because if n admits a prime factorization n=prod_{i=1}^{k} p_{i}^{r_{i}} over distinct primes p_{i}, then varphi(n)=prod_{i=1}^{k}left(p_{i}-1right) p_{i}^{r_{i}-1} 1 in particular, if an odd prime p_{i} divides n then p_{i}-1 divides varphi(n), and consequently varphi(n) is even.Then, we note that at most one odd prime divides n. Suppose otherwise, i.e., 2^{a} p_{1}^{r_{1}} p_{2}^{r_{2}} is a part of the prime factorization of n for odd primes p_{1}, p_{2}. Then by the multiplicativity of varphi, we know that varphileft(2^{a} p_{1}^{r_{1}} p_{2}^{r_{2}}right)=2^{a-1}left(p_{1}-1right) p_{1}^{r_{1}-1}left(p_{2}-1right) p_{2}^{r_{2}-1} must divide varphi(n).

This is a contradiction.Finally, we show that the said odd prime p dividing n must in fact be equal to 3 . Indeed, if n=2^{a} p^{r} where a and r are positive integers, we have frac{n}{varphi(n)}=frac{2 p}{p-1}=2+frac{2}{p-1}. For this to be an integer, p=3. Hence, we count all such integers of the form n=2^{a} 3^{r} by summing over all possible values of r (because there are fewer):If r=0, then 0 leq a leq 6.

So b must be a multiple of 4, so b = 0, 4 or 8. If b = 0, then (*) gives a = 5 and we get the solution 550. If b = 4, then (*) gives a 2 - a + 14 = 0, which has no integral solutions. If b = 8, then (since a + b ≤ 9 and a > 0) a must be 1, but that does not satisfy (*). If a + b > 9, we have (a+1) 2 + (a+b-10) 2 + b 2 = 10a + b, or 2a 2 + 2ab + 2b 2 - 28a - 21b + 101 = 0 (), so b is odd. Put b = 2B+1. Then a 2 + 2aB + 4B 2 - 13a - 17B + 41 = 0. But a(a-13) is even, so B is odd. Hence b = 3 or 7. If b = 3, then () gives a 2 - 11a + 28 = 0, so a = 4 or 7. But a + b > 9, so a = 7. That gives the solution 803.

Let 12k people be A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{12k}, and for any two people, the number of people who know both of them is m. If A_{t} knows both A_{i} and A_{j} (i neq j), then the triplet (A_{t}; A_{i}, A_{j}) is formed. Using two methods to count the number of such triplets, we get 12k C_{3k+6}^{2} = m C_{12k}^{2}. Thus, m = frac{12k C_{3k+6}^{2}}{C_{12k}^{2}} = frac{(3k+6)(3k+5)}{12k-1} = frac{9k^2 + 33k + 30}{12k-1}. Therefore, 4m = frac{36k^2 + 132k + 120}{12k-1} = 3k + 11 + frac{3k + 131}{12k-1}. If 12k-1 > 3k + 131, i.e., k geq 15, then frac{3k + 131}{12k-1} is not an integer, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, 1 leq k leq 14. Upon inspection, among 1 leq k leq 14, only k=3 makes frac{3k + 131}{12k-1} = 4 an integer. In this case, 12k = 36, 3k + 6 = 15, and m = 6. The following example shows that 12k = 36 is feasible.

Since 2 q+3 and p^{2}-p-1 are positive, it follows that p leq 2 q+3 and q leq p^{2}-p-1. To find a sharper lower bound for p, we multiply the two relationsbegin{aligned}p q & mid(2 q+3)left(p^{2}-p-1right) & mid 2 q p^{2}-2 q p-2 q+3left(p^{2}-p-1right) & mid 3left(p^{2}-p-1right)-2 q,end{aligned}where we have discarded terms with a factor of p q. Note now that 3left(p^{2}-p-1right)-2 q geq 3 q-2 q=q>0.

This can be factored as (2 p-1)(p-1)=0, which has no solutions with p prime. If k=2 or k=4, then k p is even. But 2 q+3 is odd, so these cases are ruled out. If k=3, then from 2 q+3=3 p it follows that q must be a multiple of 3. Since q is prime, we then have q=3, and thus also p=(2 q+3) / 3=3. Checking shows that this is not a solution to the original equation.The last case is k=5. Then we have 5 p=2 q+3 and from the original equation, we have 5 q=p^{2}-p-1.

To maximize the sum of absolute differences, we should pair each (a_i) with (i) such that the difference (|a_i - i|) is as large as possible. This can be achieved by reversing the order of the permutation, i.e., setting (a_i = 100 - i).3. Let's verify this by calculating the sum:   [   |a_1 - 1| + |a_2 - 2| + |a_3 - 3| + dots + |a_{99} - 99|   ]   where (a_i = 100 - i).4.

The sum of an arithmetic series is given by:   [   S_n = frac{n}{2} (a + l)   ]   where (l) is the last term. Here, (a = 98), (l = 2), and (n = 49).7.

To find the sum of these roots, we add them together:   [   x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = alpha + (alpha + pi) + beta + (beta + pi)   ]   Simplifying this, we get:   [   x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 2alpha + 2beta + 2pi   ]5. Using the identity for the sum of arctangents, we know:   [   alpha + beta = arctan left( frac{frac{9 + sqrt{77}}{2} + frac{9 - sqrt{77}}{2}}{1 - left( frac{9 + sqrt{77}}{2} right) left( frac{9 - sqrt{77}}{2} right)} right)   ]   Simplifying the numerator and denominator:   [   alpha + beta = arctan left( frac{9}{1 - left( frac{81 - 77}{4} right)} right) = arctan left( frac{9}{1 - 1} right) = arctan (infty) = frac{pi}{2}   ]6. Therefore:   [   2alpha + 2beta = 2 left( frac{pi}{2} right) = pi   ]7. Finally, the sum of the roots is:   [   x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = pi + 2pi = 3pi   ]The final answer is (boxed{3pi})"},{"problem":"The sum of four consecutive odd integers is 200 .

Representation of Numbers:   Each positive integer ( n ) can be uniquely written as ( n = 2^k cdot q ) where ( k ) is a non-negative integer and ( q ) is an odd positive integer. This is essentially the prime factorization of ( n ) where ( q ) is the product of all odd prime factors of ( n ).2. Divisibility Condition:   If two numbers ( n_1 ) and ( n_2 ) have the same odd part ( q ), then one of them must be divisible by the other. This is because if ( n_1 = 2^{k_1} cdot q ) and ( n_2 = 2^{k_2} cdot q ) with ( k_1 neq k_2 ), then without loss of generality, assume ( k_1 < k_2 ). Thus, ( n_1 ) divides ( n_2 ).3. Counting Odd Numbers:   We need to count the number of odd numbers between 1 and 100. The odd numbers in this range are ( 1, 3, 5, ldots, 99 ). This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term ( a = 1 ) and common difference ( d = 2 ).   The number of terms in this sequence can be found using the formula for the ( n )-th term of an arithmetic sequence:   [   a_n = a + (n-1)d   ]   Setting ( a_n = 99 ):   [   99 = 1 + (n-1) cdot 2 implies 99 = 1 + 2n - 2 implies 99 = 2n - 1 implies 100 = 2n implies n = 50   ]   Therefore, there are 50 odd numbers between 1 and 100.4. Constructing the Set:   Since there are 50 odd numbers, we can construct a set where each number has a unique odd part ( q ). For example, the set ( {51, 52, 53, ldots, 100} ) contains 50 elements, and none of these numbers is divisible by another because they all have different odd parts.5.

Ya. Okunev \\"Combinatorial Problems on a Chessboard\\", M.-L., ONTI, 1935.## 4. Geometric Problems in Combinatorics","solution":"40. a) Since a knight, standing on a white square, threatens only black squares, it is clear that 32 knights can be placed so that no two of them threaten each other: for this purpose, it is sufficient to place them all on the white squares of the board (there are frac{64}{2}=32 such squares). We will now show that more than 32 knights cannot be placed in the required manner. For this purpose, we divide all the squares of the chessboard into eight equal parts, each having the shape of a rectangle with a base of two squares and a height of four squares (Fig. 55). It is easy to see that a knight placed in one of these rectangles threatens exactly one square of the same rectangle, and for any two such knights, the squares they threaten are different. From this, it follows that within each of these rectangles (consisting of eight squares), no more than four knights can be placed so that they do not threaten each other. Thus, the total number of knights that can be placed on the entire chessboard does not exceed 4 cdot 8=32.b) We need to determine how many different arrangements of 32 knights on a chessboard exist such that no two of these knights threaten each other. Two such different arrangements are obvious: we can place 32 knights on all the white squares of the board (the first arrangement) or on all the black squares of the board (the second arrangement). We will prove that no other arrangements exist.Again, we divide our board into eight equal parts as shown in Fig. 55. In each of these parts, we must place exactly four knights (see the solution to part a)). Now, let's consider how four knights can be placed in the lower left rectangle (we will call this rectangle the first).First, let's try to occupy both lower squares of this rectangle (these squares are marked with circles in Fig. 56, a). In this case, the squares of the first rectangle marked with crosses on the drawing must be left free: the squares of the third row are under threat from the placed knights, and the square of the second row, marked with a cross, cannot be occupied, as then five squares in the second lower left rectangle will be under threat from three placed knights, and consequently, it will be impossible to place four knights in this rectangle. If we place two more knights on the squares marked with stars in Fig. 56, a, then it will again be impossible to place four knights in the second lower left rectangle (because only three squares of this rectangle, marked with crosses in Fig. 56, a, will not be under threat); therefore, this arrangement is also invalid. If we place knights on the squares of the first rectangle marked with circles in Fig. 56, b, then in the second lower left rectangle, we will be forced to occupy the squares marked with circles on the same drawing (the other squares of the specified rectangle are under threat from the knights of the first rectangle); in this case, only two knights can be placed in the third lower left rectangle (on the squares marked with circles). Therefore, this possibility is also invalid. Finally, if we occupy the squares of the first and fourth rows in the first rectangle (Fig. 56, c), then in the second lower left rectangle, we will also have to occupy the squares of the same rows; in this case, in the upper left rectangle, knights can only be placed on the squares of the seventh and eighth rows, and in the second upper left rectangle, it will be impossible to place any knights. Thus, we see that both lower squares of the first rectangle cannot be occupied simultaneously.If no knight stands in the lower row of the first rectangle, then knights must stand on both squares of the third row. But these two knights threaten five squares of the adjacent left rectangle; therefore, this position is also impossible.Thus, it remains to consider that in the lower row of the first rectangle, there must be exactly one knight. On the upper (fourth) row of the first rectangle, there is also exactly one knight. Indeed, if no knight stood on this row, then two knights would have to stand on the second row, and these knights threaten five squares of the second lower left rectangle. If two knights stood on the fourth row, then either it would be impossible to place four knights in the second lower left rectangle (Fig. 56, z), or four knights could be placed in the second rectangle, but not in the third (Fig. 56, y).It is easy to see that the knight on the lower row and the knight on the upper row of the first rectangle must stand in different columns—otherwise, it would again be impossible to place four knights in the second and third left rectangles (see Fig. 56, e and g). But if these two knights stand on different columns (i.e., on squares of the same color, see Fig. 56, z), then the two knights on the second and third rows must be placed on two squares of the same color—only such squares are not under threat. Further, in the second rectangle, only squares of the same color are not under threat, then in the third, and so on, i.e., on the entire lower half of the board. These same considerations apply to the upper half of the board, where all knights must also be placed on squares of the same color. It is clear that if we choose one color in the lower half and another in the upper half, then a row of knights will threaten each other. Thus, only two possibilities remain: to place all knights on all white or all black squares.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_68334347b64402497ba5g-173.jpg?height=406&width=405&top_left_y=645&top_left_x=135)Fig. 55. for any two such knights, the squares they threaten are different. From this, it follows that within each of these rectangles (consisting of eight squares), no more than four knights can be placed so that they do not threaten each other.

Substituting ( P(3,±2 sqrt {6}) ) into the equation of the hyperbola ( frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}- frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1 ) yields ( frac {9}{a^{2}}- frac {24}{b^{2}}=1 ).  Solving this equation with respect to ( a ) and ( b ), we arrive at the quartic equation in terms of ( a^2 ), (a^{4}-37a^{2}+36=0),  which has solutions (a^{2}=1) or (a^{2}=36). We discard (a^{2}=36) since it does not satisfy the initial condition ( a^{2}+b^{2}=4 ).  Thus, ( a^{2}=1 ) and consequently ( b^{2}=3 ).  The equation of the sought hyperbola is ( x^{2}- frac {y^{2}}{3}=1 ).  Therefore, the correct choice is ( boxed{D} ).  This problem tests the understanding of the equation of a hyperbola and the application of the basic properties of a parabola. It is an intermediate-level question that requires a solid grasp of the basic properties of both parabolas and hyperbolas."},{"problem":"Numbers 1,frac12,frac13,ldots,frac1{2001} are written on a blackboard.

Understanding the operation:   The operation described in the problem is to erase two numbers ( x ) and ( y ) and write down the number ( x + y + xy ). This can be rewritten using the identity:   [   x + y + xy = (x+1)(y+1) - 1   ]   This identity will be useful in simplifying the problem.2. Transforming the problem:   Let's consider the transformation ( z = x + 1 ) and ( w = y + 1 ). Then the operation becomes:   [   (x+1)(y+1) - 1 = zw - 1   ]   This means that instead of working with ( x ) and ( y ), we can work with ( z ) and ( w ) where ( z = x+1 ) and ( w = y+1 ).3. Initial transformation:   The initial numbers on the blackboard are ( 1, frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{3}, ldots, frac{1}{2001} ). Transforming these numbers using ( z = x + 1 ), we get:   [   2, frac{3}{2}, frac{4}{3}, ldots, frac{2002}{2001}   ]4.

Let x be a common complex root of the two equations given in the problem.

Thus, k must be chosen such that the linear term with n in (k-1) cancels out with a term from -n^2 + (10+k)n.This requires k = 1 to eliminate the n term in (k-1), so we get:k = 1Now, we substitute k = 1 into S_n to find the simplified expression for the series sum:S_n = -n^2 + 11nFor an arithmetic sequence, the nth term a_n can be found by subtracting the (n-1)th partial sum S_{n-1} from the nth partial sum S_n, that is:a_n = S_n - S_{n-1}When n = 1, we can directly calculate the first term:a_1 = S_1 = -1^2 + 11 cdot 1 = 10For n geq 2, we apply the difference to find a_n:begin{align*}a_n &= S_n - S_{n-1} &= (-n^2 + 11n) - [-(n-1)^2 + 11(n-1)] &= -n^2 + 11n - ((1 - 2n + n^2) - 11 + 11n) &= -n^2 + 11n + 2n - 1 - n^2 - 11n &= -2n + 12 end{align*}Note that when n = 1, the expression for a_n also holds true.

Recall that in arithmetic sequences, the sum of the terms equidistant from the start and end of a finite sequence is the same. So a_4 + a_{14} = a_1 + a_{17} = 2.

Also, 10b -10 = 10(b-1) = 11c, so b-1 is divisible by 11. We find that the least possible value of b = 45, so the answer is 10(45) + 45 = 495.Solution 2Let the desired integer be n.

If the distance to the destination is d=frac{23}{15} a kilometers, how should it proceed?","solution":"[Solution] We apply the following general principle: If P is any point on the route, the total amount of gasoline transported to point P by the car, once or multiple times, must never be less than the total fuel consumption for the car's travel after point P.As shown in the figure, let O be the starting point, X the destination, and the length of O X be frac{4}{3} a = a + frac{1}{3} a kilometers.Consider the point M on the route, which is a kilometers away from X. The car must travel at least once between M and X, thus consuming at least L liters of fuel. According to the above principle, at least L liters of fuel must be transported to point M.To transport L liters of fuel to point M, taking fuel from point O once is insufficient, as some fuel will be consumed along the way. Therefore, fuel must be taken at least twice, meaning the car must travel back and forth between O and M at least three times.Since O M = frac{1}{3} a, traveling back and forth three times between O and M is exactly a kilometers, consuming L liters of fuel. Thus, the car can depart from O with L liters of fuel, store frac{1}{3} L liters of fuel at point M, and return to point O. Then, it can take another L liters of fuel from O, consume frac{1}{3} L liters on the way to M, leaving frac{2}{3} L liters, and add the frac{1}{3} L liters stored at M, totaling L liters, which is enough to reach point X.Therefore, a total of 2 L liters of fuel is required, which is clearly the minimum fuel consumption.If O X = frac{23}{15} a kilometers, sincefrac{23}{15} a = a + frac{1}{3} a + frac{1}{5} a.A point M_{1} can be chosen on O X such that M_{1} X = frac{4}{3} a kilometers. According to the above discussion, traveling from M_{1} to X requires at least 2 L liters of fuel. Therefore, at least 2 L liters of fuel must be transported to M_{1}. Clearly, taking fuel from O twice is insufficient, and the car must travel back and forth between O and M_{1} five times, as O M_{1} = frac{1}{5} a kilometers, and traveling back and forth five times consumes L liters of fuel. Therefore, traveling from O to X requires at least 3 L liters of fuel.For this purpose, a first fuel storage station can be set up at M_{1}, and a second fuel storage station at M, which is a kilometers away from X. Three trips from O can be made, taking a total of 3 L liters of fuel, and traveling back and forth five times between O and M_{1} consumes L liters of fuel, leaving 2 L liters of fuel to be stored at M_{1}, which is exactly enough for the trip from M_{1} to X."},{"problem":"A basketball player made 5 baskets during a game.

If k itself is a multiple of three, say k=3 ell, then exactly ell numbers in the sequence are multiples of three: one in each consecutive group of three numbers. If k is not a multiple of three, say k=3 ell+1 or k=3 ell+2, then at least ell of the numbers in the sequence are multiples of three, because k geqslant 3 ell.

By the Law of Sines, we know that frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C}. This implies that the sides of the triangle are in the same ratio as the sines of their opposite angles, so a:b:c = 2:1:sqrt{2}. Given that b = sqrt{2}, we can find the values of a and c as follows:- For a, since b = sqrt{2} and the ratio a:b = 2:1, we have a = 2 cdot b = 2sqrt{2}.- For c, since b = sqrt{2} and the ratio c:b = sqrt{2}:1, we have c = sqrt{2} cdot b = 2.Thus, the value of a is boxed{2sqrt{2}}. For part (2), finding the value of cos C:Using the Law of Cosines in triangle ABC, we have cos C = frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}. Substituting the values of a, b, and c we found earlier:[cos C = frac{(2sqrt{2})^2 + (sqrt{2})^2 - 2^2}{2 cdot 2sqrt{2} cdot sqrt{2}} = frac{8 + 2 - 4}{2 cdot 2 cdot 2} = frac{6}{8} = frac{3}{4}.]Therefore, the value of cos C is boxed{frac{3}{4}}. For part (3), finding the value of sin (2C-frac{pi}{6}):First, we find sin C and cos C to calculate sin 2C and cos 2C:- We already found cos C = frac{3}{4}, so sin C = sqrt{1 - cos^2 C} = sqrt{1 - left(frac{3}{4}right)^2} = frac{sqrt{7}}{4}.- Then, sin 2C = 2sin Ccos C = 2 cdot frac{sqrt{7}}{4} cdot frac{3}{4} = frac{3sqrt{7}}{8}.- And, cos 2C = 2cos^2 C - 1 = 2left(frac{3}{4}right)^2 - 1 = frac{1}{8}.Finally, using the formula for sin (A - B), we find sin (2C-frac{pi}{6}):[sin (2C-frac{pi}{6}) = sin 2Ccos frac{pi}{6} - cos 2Csin frac{pi}{6} = frac{3sqrt{7}}{8} cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{1}{8} cdot frac{1}{2} = frac{3sqrt{21}}{16} - frac{1}{16} = frac{3sqrt{21} - 1}{16}.]Therefore, the value of sin (2C-frac{pi}{6}) is boxed{frac{3sqrt{21} - 1}{16}}."},{"problem":"Task 4.5.

Since the mean score is 85, the probabilities on either side of the mean are equal. The probability that a score falls between 80 and 90 is given as 0.3. This probability covers the area from 80 to 90, which is symmetrically positioned around the mean.To find the probability that a score is not less than 90, we look at the upper tail of the distribution starting from 90. Given the symmetry of the normal distribution and the provided probability for the interval 80 < X < 90, we can deduce that the area under the curve from 90 to infinity is half of the area outside the interval 80 < X < 90.The total area under the normal distribution curve represents the total probability, which is 1. The area outside the interval 80 < X < 90 can be calculated as 1 - P(80 < X < 90) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. Since we are interested in the area from 90 to infinity, which is half of this, we calculate it as follows:[P(X geqslant 90) = frac{1}{2} left[1 - P(80 < X < 90)right] = frac{1}{2}(1 - 0.3) = frac{1}{2} times 0.7 = 0.35]Therefore, the probability that a high school senior selected from this city has a score not less than 90 points is boxed{0.35}.Hence, the correct answer is boxed{A}."},{"problem":"A set of five different positive integers has an average (arithmetic mean) of 11.

Monotonicity and Range of f(x):- Monotonicity: Since f'(x)=frac{1}{x}+1 > 0 for all x > 0, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, +infty).- Limits: As x rightarrow 0, ln x rightarrow -infty, implying f(x) rightarrow -infty.

This can be factored as (f(x) + 1)(f(x) - 3) = 0.- For f(x) = -1: There is one solution because f(x) is continuous and monotonically increasing. We denote this solution as x_1.- For f(x) = 3: Similarly, there is one solution, denoted as x_2.Thus, g(x) has two zeros, making choice A incorrect and B correct.3. Analysis for Choice C and D:- For Choice C: Considering f_2(x) = f(x) - 3, we note f_2(1) = f(1) - 3 = ln(1) + 2 - 3 = -1  0. Since f_2(x) is monotonically increasing, it crosses zero exactly once in the interval (1, 2).

Define Euler's Totient Function: For any natural number ( m ), Euler's totient function ( phi(m) ) counts the number of integers ( k ) that are relatively prime to ( m ) and satisfy ( 1 le k le m ).2. Identify the Problem: We need to determine all positive integers ( n ) such that for every integer ( k > n^2 ), ( n ) divides ( phi(nk + 1) ).3. Choose a Prime ( p ): Let ( p ) be the smallest prime that does not divide ( n ). This choice is crucial because it allows us to construct large values of ( k ) such that ( nk + 1 ) has a specific form.4. Construct ( k ): Consider ( k = frac{p^x - 1}{n} ) for some large ( x ). This ensures ( k ) is an integer because ( p^x - 1 ) is divisible by ( n ).5. Evaluate ( phi(nk + 1) ): We have ( nk + 1 = p^x ). Therefore, ( phi(nk + 1) = phi(p^x) = p^x - p^{x-1} = p^{x-1}(p - 1) ).6. Divisibility Condition: Since ( n mid phi(nk + 1) ), we must have ( n mid p^{x-1}(p - 1) ). Given that ( p ) does not divide ( n ), it follows that ( n mid (p - 1) ).7. Bound on ( n ): This implies ( n le p - 1 ). Let ( q ) be the largest prime factor of ( n ).

Substituting (k = pn) into the equation, we get:   [   (pn)^2 - p(pn) = m^2   ]   Simplifying, we have:   [   p^2n^2 - p^2n = m^2   ]   Dividing both sides by (p^2), we get:   [   n^2 - n = left(frac{m}{p}right)^2   ]   Since (n^2 - n) is an integer, (left(frac{m}{p}right)^2) must also be an integer, implying (p mid m). Let (m = pq). Then:   [   n^2 - n = q^2   ]   However, (n^2 - n = q^2) implies (q^2 < n^2), which is impossible for all (n > 1). Therefore, (p nmid k). (blacksquare)5. Since (gcd(p, k) = 1), we also have (gcd(k - p, k) = 1). Therefore, (k) and (k - p) must both be squares or both be the negations of squares.6. If both (k) and (k - p) are positive squares, let (k = m^2). Then:   [   m^2 - p = x^2   ]   for some integer (x). This can be rewritten as:   [   m^2 - x^2 = p   ]   Factoring, we get:   [   (m - x)(m + x) = p   ]   Since (p) is a prime, the factors must be ((m - x, m + x) = (1, p)) or ((p, 1)). Solving these, we get:   [   m - x = 1 quad text{and} quad m + x = p   ]   Adding these equations, we get:   [   2m = p + 1 implies m = frac{p + 1}{2}   ]   Subtracting these equations, we get:   [   2x = p - 1 implies x = frac{p - 1}{2}   ]   Therefore, (k = m^2 = left(frac{p + 1}{2}right)^2).7. If both (k) and (k - p) are the negations of squares, let (k = -m^2). Then:   [   -m^2 - p = -x^2 implies m^2 = x^2 + p   ]   This implies:   [   m^2 - x^2 = p   ]   which is the same equation as before, leading to the same solutions.8. For (p = 2), the equation becomes:   [   k^2 - 2k = n^2   ]   which does not yield any integer solutions for (k).Conclusion:The desired solutions are:[k = left(frac{p + 1}{2}right)^2 quad text{and} quad k = -left(frac{p - 1}{2}right)^2]for odd primes (p), and no solutions exist for (p = 2).The final answer is ( boxed{ k = left(frac{p + 1}{2}right)^2 quad text{and} quad k = -left(frac{p - 1}{2}right)^2 } ) for odd primes (p), and no solutions exist for (p = 2)."},{"problem":"4.

First, we need to simplify the expression for ( x ):   [   x = frac{sqrt{6 + 2sqrt{5}} + sqrt{6 - 2sqrt{5}}}{sqrt{20}}   ]2. We start by simplifying the terms inside the square roots. Notice that:   [   sqrt{6 + 2sqrt{5}} = sqrt{(sqrt{5} + 1)^2} = sqrt{5} + 1   ]   and   [   sqrt{6 - 2sqrt{5}} = sqrt{(sqrt{5} - 1)^2} = sqrt{5} - 1   ]3. Substituting these back into the expression for ( x ):   [   x = frac{(sqrt{5} + 1) + (sqrt{5} - 1)}{sqrt{20}}   ]4. Simplify the numerator:   [   x = frac{2sqrt{5}}{sqrt{20}}   ]5. Simplify the denominator:   [   sqrt{20} = sqrt{4 cdot 5} = 2sqrt{5}   ]6. Substitute back into the expression for ( x ):   [   x = frac{2sqrt{5}}{2sqrt{5}} = 1   ]7.

How many different white figures are possible to do with k rectangles that can't be done with less than k rectangles?Proposed by David Torres Flores","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to determine the number of different white figures that can be created on an ( n times n ) board by drawing ( k ) rectangles, each covering the top-right corner of the board. The white figure should be such that it cannot be created with fewer than ( k ) rectangles.2. Analyzing the Rectangles:   Each rectangle has its top-right corner at the top-right corner of the board. The bottom-left corner of each rectangle can be any point on the board. Therefore, each rectangle can be uniquely identified by its bottom-left corner coordinates ((i, j)) where (1 leq i, j leq n).3. Determining the White Region:   The white region left after drawing ( k ) rectangles is bounded by the bottom-left corners of these rectangles. Specifically, the white region is determined by the minimum ( k ) vertical and horizontal lines that are not covered by any of the ( k ) rectangles.4. Counting the Lines:   The white region is uniquely determined by the ( k ) vertical and ( k ) horizontal lines that are not covered by the rectangles. We need to choose ( k ) lines from the ( n ) available lines (excluding the rightmost and bottommost lines).5. Combinatorial Calculation:   The number of ways to choose ( k ) lines from ( n ) available lines is given by the binomial coefficient (binom{n}{k}). Since we need to choose ( k ) vertical lines and ( k ) horizontal lines independently, the total number of ways to choose these lines is (binom{n}{k} times binom{n}{k}).6. Final Expression:   The total number of different white figures that can be created with ( k ) rectangles is given by:   [   left( binom{n}{k} right)^2   ]The final answer is (boxed{left( binom{n}{k} right)^2})."},{"problem":"7.

Therefore, a_{n+2} - 2a_{n+1} = 2(a_{n+1} - 2a_n), which implies b_{n+1} = 2b_n. Thus, {b_n} is a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2. Since a_1 = 1, we have a_2 = 4a_1 + 2 - a_1 = 3a_1 + 2 = 5, and so b_1 = a_2 - 2a_1 = 5 - 2 = 3. Hence, b_n = 3 cdot 2^{n-1}.2.

(1) Express the number of people who have contracted the flu after the first round using an expression containing x: After the first round, a total of ①______ people have contracted the flu. In the second round of transmission, each of these people infects x people, resulting in a total of ②______ people contracting the flu after the second round. (2) Based on the given information, write the corresponding equation as ③______. (3) Solve this equation to obtain ④______. (4) Based on the practical meaning of the problem, on average, one person infects ⑤______ people.","solution":"To solve the problem step-by-step while adhering to the specified format:(1) Expression for the number of people infected after each round:- After the first round, one person has infected x others, so the total number of people who have contracted the flu is the initial person plus those they infected, which gives us 1 + x.- In the second round, each of these 1 + x people infects x more people. Therefore, the total number of people infected after the second round is 1 + x + x(1 + x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x = 1 + 2x + x^2.Thus, the expressions are 1 + x for the first round and 1 + 2x + x^2 for the total after the second round.(2) Corresponding equation based on the given information:Given that a total of 121 people have contracted the flu after two rounds, we set up the equation as 1 + x + x(1 + x) = 121, simplifying to 1 + 2x + x^2 = 121.(3) Solving the equation:Starting with 1 + 2x + x^2 = 121, we rearrange it to get x^2 + 2x + 1 = 121. Subtracting 121 from both sides gives us x^2 + 2x - 120 = 0. Factoring or using the quadratic formula, we find that (x+1)^2 = 121. Taking the square root of both sides, we get x + 1 = pm11. Solving for x, we find two possible values: x_1 = 10 and x_2 = -12.(4) Determining the practical solution:Considering the context of the problem, where a negative number of infections is not possible, we discard x_2 = -12.

Plugging this new piece of information into the initial equation yields 4 a^{2}=2^{a+1} so a^{2}=2^{a-1}. If a>1, then a has to be even since 2^{a-1} is even. However, on the other hand, since a^{2} is a perfect square, 2^{a-1} has to be a perfect square as well, so a must also be odd, which is a contradiction. Thus, the only option is a=1 which indeed satisfies the initial equation. Thus, out of this case, we obtain one solution: (a, b, p)=(1,1,2).- Case 2: a neq bSince the equation is symmetric in a and b, assume wlog b>a.

We use proof by contradiction. Suppose there exist 15 subsets of X such that the union of any 7 of them contains at least 41 elements, and the intersection of any 3 of them is empty. Since each element belongs to at most 2 subsets, we can assume each element belongs to exactly 2 subsets (otherwise, we can add some elements to some subsets, and the conditions still hold).

Consider any 7 subsets that do not include A, each corresponding to 41 elements in X. All 7-subset groups that do not include A together correspond to at least 41 C_{14}^{7} elements. On the other hand, for an element a, if a notin A, then 2 of A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{14} contain a, so a is counted C_{14}^{7}-C_{12}^{7} times; if a in A, then 1 of A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{14} contains a, so a is counted C_{14}^{7}-C_{13}^{7} times.

Since the asymptote is perpendicular to the line with slope -frac{1}{2}, we have the relationship between the slopes of the line and the asymptote as -frac{1}{2}⋅frac{b}{a}=-1. Solving this equation gives us frac{b}{a}=2. Therefore, the equations of the asymptotes of hyperbola C are y=±2x, which can also be written as 2xpm y=0.Given that the distance from the right vertex (a,0) to this asymptote is frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}, we use the formula for the distance from a point to a line to find a. The distance formula gives us frac{|2a+0|}{sqrt{2^2+1^2}}=frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}. Simplifying this equation, we find that a=1. Since we already know that frac{b}{a}=2, substituting a=1 gives us b=2.Therefore, the equation of the hyperbola C is frac{{x}^{2}}{1^2}-frac{{y}^{2}}{2^2}=1, which simplifies to boxed{{x}^{2}-frac{{y}^{2}}{4}=1}.Part (2): Finding the Slope of the Line lGiven that the line l intersects the hyperbola at points A and B with the midpoint M(3,2), we know that x_1+x_2=6 and y_1+y_2=4. The slope of the line l, denoted as k, can be related to the coordinates of A and B.Since the line l is not perpendicular to the x-axis (as that would contradict the given conditions), we can use the properties of the hyperbola and the midpoint to find k. We have the equations of the hyperbola at points A and B as {x}_{1}^{2}-frac{{y}_{1}^{2}}{4}=1 and {x}_{2}^{2}-frac{{y}_{2}^{2}}{4}=1. Subtracting these equations gives us ({x}_{1}^{2}-{x}_{2}^{2})-frac{{y}_{1}^{2}-{y}_{2}^{2}}{4}=0. This simplifies to ({x}_{1}+{x}_{2})({x}_{1}-{x}_{2})-frac{({y}_{1}+{y}_{2})({y}_{1}-{y}_{2})}{4}=0, which rearranges to frac{{y}_{1}+{y}_{2}}{{x}_{1}+{x}_{2}}⋅frac{{y}_{1}-{y}_{2}}{{x}_{1}-{x}_{2}}=4.Given x_1+x_2=6 and y_1+y_2=4, we substitute these values into the equation to find the slope k. This gives us frac{4}{6}⋅k=4, which simplifies to k=6.Therefore, the slope of the line l is boxed{6}."},{"problem":"If  a,b,cin {rm Z} and[ begin{array}{l} {xequiv a, , , pmod{14}} {xequiv b, , , pmod {15}} {xequiv c, , , pmod {16}} end{array}], the number of integral solutions of the congruence system on the interval  0le x < 2000 cannot betextbf{(A)} 0  qquadtextbf{(B)} 1  qquadtextbf{(C)} 2  qquadtextbf{(D)} 3  qquadtextbf{(E)} text{None}","solution":"1. We start with the system of congruences:   [   begin{array}{l}   x equiv a pmod{14}    x equiv b pmod{15}    x equiv c pmod{16}   end{array}   ]   where (a, b, c in mathbb{Z}).2. According to the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), a solution exists if and only if the moduli are pairwise coprime. Here, 14, 15, and 16 are pairwise coprime:   [   gcd(14, 15) = 1, quad gcd(14, 16) = 2, quad gcd(15, 16) = 1   ]   Since 14 and 16 are not coprime, we need to consider the specific values of (a, b, c).3. If (a) is odd and (c) is even, there is no solution. This is because the congruences would be incompatible. For example, if (a = 1) and (c = 2), then:   [   x equiv 1 pmod{14} quad text{and} quad x equiv 2 pmod{16}   ]   These two congruences cannot be satisfied simultaneously.4. Let (a = 2a') and (c = 2c'), then the system becomes:   [   begin{array}{l}   x equiv 2a' pmod{14}    x equiv b pmod{15}    x equiv 2c' pmod{16}   end{array}   ]   This system can be solved using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.5. The general solution to the system is of the form:   [   x = 1680k + m   ]   where (1680 = text{lcm}(14, 15, 16)).6. To find the number of solutions in the interval (0 leq x < 2000), we solve:   [   0 leq 1680k + m < 2000   ]   This simplifies to:   [   0 leq k < frac{2000 - m}{1680}   ]   Since (m) is a constant determined by the specific values of (a, b, c), the number of solutions (k) can take is either 1 or 2.7. We will show that the solution of the second congruence is also the solution of the first congruence. From the second congruence:   [   x = 1680k + 7p + 2a' = 1680k + 16q + 2c' = 1680k + 15r + b   ]   Since the right-hand side is even, (p) must be even. Thus:   [   x = 1680k + 14p' + 2a' = 1680k + 16q + 2c' = 1680k + 15r + b   ]   Rewriting the equation as congruences, we get:   [   begin{array}{l}   x equiv 2a' pmod{14}    x equiv b pmod{15}    x equiv 2c' pmod{16}   end{array}   ]8.

The first condition is satisfied if q is an odd number, because then the expression in the parentheses is also odd. The second condition is satisfied if q is divisible by 3, or if q^{2}+q+1=(q-1)^{2}+3 q, meaning if (q-1)^{2} is divisible by 3. The first condition holds for numbers of the form q=3M, and the second for numbers of the form q=3M+1, where M is an integer, since a square number is divisible by 3 if and only if the base number is divisible by 3, due to the primality of 3.Combining the two conditions, the remainder of the numerator when divided by 6 must be odd, and it must be one of the numbers 0 and 3, or 1 and 4.
