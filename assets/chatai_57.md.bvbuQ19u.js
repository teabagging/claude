But the cause of the nerve compression needs to be evaluated by doing a MRI scan of your lower back. If it is extremely painful to even move you need to discuss it with your spine specialist as it could be a vertebral compression fracture. This can be easily treated when under the care of good surgeon. So I urge you to see a spine surgeon and get it looked after."},{"Patient":"I have had back pain on both sides at my waistline, that raps around each side for the past couple of days. Breathing deep causes the pain to increase. Aspirin and the heating pad help a little, and the pain is different than an aching back caused by overuse. The pain feels internal, if that makes sense. Just wondering how long I should wait before seeing doctor.","Doctor":"Hi,Your pain might probably be from a pinched nerve. When you take a deep breath the abdominal pressure increases causing increased compression of the nerves, which in turn causes the pain. If the pain is not relieved by taking over-the-counter meds or if it is increasing in severity or if you experience new symptoms like pain going to your thighs and down the leg along with numbness, you should see a spine specialist. There is no exact time frame that can be foretold as the symptoms are subjective to change. It always helps to get a baseline MRI and follow it up if the symptoms change for the worse. Hope this answers your question."},{"Patient":"The right lower back side of my body has been swollen and in pain for several days now. I ice it down 2 or 3 times a day and before I go to bed I put icy hot cream on it. It still bothers me later on. I thought maybe it s a sprain or pulled muscle but idk . I know it s hurts when I bend over and it has been this way for 3 days already.","Doctor":"Hi,At the moment, the swelling along with lower back pain make me think of pilonidal abscess. However a detailed examination by a physician will help to distinguish that pain from the one that happens after a pinched nerve or a sprained muscle. To help with the pain you can also use over-the-counter Tylenol provided there are no contraindications or allergy to it. You also will need to avoid bending forward excessively or carrying heavy weights."},{"Patient":"HI i am 52 hight 4ft 11in 11stone 11 lb i have had my throyed removed in november 2010 i cant seem to loos waight tired all the time i am on 100 mg per day i dont think it is enought but the doc said my bloods are fine. since i put on waight i have lower back pain and it is going into the top of my legs is there anney thing i can do thank you","Doctor":"Hi,The pain can be managed with pain medications like Tylenol, Advil initially. But a comprehensive plan would be to lose weight through exercise and strengthening of back muscles. You will need to see a physical therapist initially and avoid lifting heavy weights.

The spinal canal is a central cylindrical space in the vertebral column which houses the spinal cord. Due to some conditions, the canal can get narrowed and this causes the nerves exiting out and the cord to be compressed; which is causing your symptoms. If the symptoms are getting severe as you had said, you must consult a spine surgeon immediately and get a MRI scan done of your lower back along with a complete spinal screening. It also requires surgical correction if a trial of pain medications and physical therapy fail to rectify your pain and other symptoms."},{"Patient":"hi my dad has severe pain on left hand side hip/lower back area.initial x-ray showed possible hip bone crumbling but physio has since said she thinks it may be a slipped disc pushing on a nerve. his left leg is so weak he cant walk on it,he is also constipated and keeps losing his balance. he has been waiting nearly 2 months for a scan. What do you think it could be?","Doctor":"Hi,The symptoms your dad is experiencing is due to lumbar radiculopathy. However a complete neurological examination is required so that he can be assessed more clearly. There must be huge protrusion of a disc which is compressing the nerves that supply his leg causing severe symptoms. (Although there can be various other causes but this is the most likely). You should definitely get a MRI scan done of his lower back immediately and follow up with the Neurosurgeon/ Spine surgeon and he will require decompression surgery as soon as possible."},{"Patient":"I have had a MRI on my lower back and while it showed DDD and arthritis it does not show any disc compression or bulging.

Any suggestions","Doctor":"Hi,The DDD must be causing the pain in your lower back. Sometimes it may cause instability in your spine and this doesn't show up in a MRI as you are basically lying down. To diagnose that, you generally need 3 X-rays in standing position. The first is called an AP X-ray where basically the rays pass from your front to back and give a picture of your lumbosacral spine. The other two are called dynamic X-rays which are taken from the side (lateral) while you bend forward (flexion) and backward (extension). This might show the reason why you are having pain on standing. You should discuss it with your physician and schedule them. Meanwhile if the pain is severe, you can start taking over-the-counter Tylenol; provided you are not allergic to it and not consuming alcohol too during that period."},{"Patient":"I was dusting yesterday and all of a sudden i got an enormous pain in my back and fell to my knees.

Pain relievers don't seem to help much either. But, I am able to lie comfortably on my back or side as long as  i don't move.","Doctor":"Your symptoms are most probably due to a spasm in paraspinal muscles. These are muscles that lie on the either side of your spine. They must have become spasmodic when you were dusting the rugs. I would suggest you to take complete bed rest for a period of 1-2 days until the pain subsides. However you can attend to your daily needs and keep it to minimum essential activity. You can also afford some relief using hot water compresses over that area for a period of 20 minutes every 3 hours. Since the pain relievers aren't helping, you should get prescription medications for a period of two weeks, for which you will need to see your physician."},{"Patient":"I have had severe pain in my upper back for about the past 5 days now.

Also you have mentioned that scans were done. Was it a MRI scan of the lower back? If yes, and it shows a normal study then you would need to do dynamic X-rays to search for any disk slippage. On the other hand if it shows a disc protrusion or compression of spinal cord or nerve roots, you would require microdiscectomy surgery after a careful and thorough neurologic examination. Initially you can also go for physical therapy where your pain can be managed with ultrasound therapy and interferential therapy.

Where do you think this pain is coming from and will the ibuprofen I'm going to take make a difference?","Doctor":"Hi,The pain is most probably a muscular pain but however it could be from a pinched nerve too. It should settle using Ibuprofen, but I would suggest over-the-counter Tylenol for the pain as it does not cause the side effects coming from using Ibuprofen. I would however suggest that you not take either of them on an empty stomach. Also it would be prudent that you abstain from alcohol, if at all during the period of your medication. You could also use an antacid before you have some food."},{"Patient":"i have mild canal stenosis and mild right neural foramina narrowing at L4-5 secondary to right disc bulge and posterior element hypertrophy. l3/l4 diffuse disc bulge without spinal canal etc...same at l5/s1 and l4/l5 assymmetric right disc bulge with mild spinal canals stenosis and mild right neural foraminal narrowing.

Get in urine culture .However, there are so many other possibilities of such pain ( off & on , dull pain ) as muscle strain due to gym ( fitness ) , chronic appendicitis , worm infestation , indigestion.Fluid intake is not related to this pain .I recommend you visit a physician and get his opinion as physical examination is important.Good luck."},{"Patient":"Hi dr.  My 18 year old daughter jumped on my back, I wasn't standing straight and went down on one knee.  I seemed to have over extended it as I fell.  The pain was excrusiating but soon got better.  By the next day I could hardly stand on it, it was swollen.  I have been limping for a week and it hurts to bend it.  Also it seems to lock in the mornings or if I sit for a while I can't put too much weight on it.  I have tried ice, hot baths, and even a heating pad but I still have pain.  What should I do?","Doctor":"it seems that you have a injury to meniscus or cruciate ligaments. best thing to do is application of ice , anti infallmatory medications rest and examination by an orthopedic surgeon.you can directly go for mri after a week or so to get confirmed diagnosis."},{"Patient":"i have had back pain for 17 months. they just did a mri and found that i have boulging discs in L4 and L5. is there anything that i can do to help with the pain. i have done ice and heat. ibp tyl, and alieve.  the numbing and bruning all down the back is just horrible. is there some else that i can try?","Doctor":"HelloThank you for writing to us on Health care Magic.Based on your history the response to your question is as follows.1. Bulging disc is due to compression between L4 and L5, which is also affecting the nerve resulting in back pain. Areas supplying the nerve may also be painful.2. Muscle strengthening exercises to prevent further compression will be very helpful.3. Also, lumbar support devices, proper posture training and water bed to maintain the lumbar curvature will be helpful. Avoid lifting anything heavy and while travelling, avoid jerks, which can affect the vertebrae. Use walking stick to avoid excessive weight on the vertebrae.4. Local application will relieve mild pain. You might require opioid analgesics if NSAIDs are not working. Meet your doctor for prescription.Hope this is helpful to you.Do write back to me for further questions.Thank you"},{"Patient":"hi! just want to ask what illness i have... my upper back is aching right below the shoulders where i cannot touch.. often i felt air bubbling from my back going to my neck... my nerves in the back going to my neck is also painful... i have a cry cough after a measles... please help... i am taking Lagundi cough syrup trying to ease the cough? What shall i do?","Doctor":"Hello, I have studied your case. According to your symptoms this looks as acute cervical muscle sprain in your upper back.Most probably due to bad posture or sudden jerk.Another differential diagnosis can be lumbar disc bulge leading to sudden onset of pain.Intervertebral disc compresses spinal cord and leads to upper back pain.When such patient comes to our hospital we usually do x ray to rule out any nerve compression.MRI spine will show any disc bulge is there or not.And when muscle sprain is confirmed muscle relaxant, analgesic and neurotropic medication can be started.Till time, avoid lifting weights, Sit with support to back. You can consult physiotherapist for help.Physiotherapy like ultrasound and interferential therapy will give quick relief.Hope this answers your query.

I m all bent over.","Doctor":"Hello there ! Curved spine or Scoliosis is a condition where your spine shows a C shaped or an S shaped curve when observed from the back . In a C shaped curve , the concave side muscles are shortened and weak , while the opposite side muscles are  lengthened and weak. Some curves are reversible , others are structural and cannot be reversed. In either of the cases , the aim is to strengthen the paraspinal muscles , to help reverse the curve in the former case, or prevent worsening of  the curve in the latter . If left untreated , it  could cause symptoms similar to yours , due to undue pressure on the joints above and below the curve , including the pelvis , knees , and higher up in the shoulders , neck etc ! There are very specific exercises for scoliosis , which you physio will be able to guide you with .  you will need a full fledged back rehabilitation program . In addition ,  your physio will also be able to tell you if you may need any kind of footwear modification . Also , check your posture often . People generally tend to sit in a position which aggravates the curve , as that itself is the most comfortable position for them! check with your physio about workstation ergonomics . Taping , pain relief modalities , and intense exercises will help you in this condition. Do seek  a physio opinion .

With that in mind, it has me concluding this ailment as a trapped nerve, possible herniated disc or an impingement of my sciatic nerve(s).I had a very gruelling two day labour, due to my baby opting for a occiput posterior position, so most of my contractions were spread across my back.

First of all get examined by a Doctor who on clinical / physical examination can advise you the proper antibiotics, metronidazole, probiotic and if required laxatives.

I have had a year of leg and back pain.  But, on top of this I have diastasis recti....

The treatment options for Lumbar bulging disc depends upon degree of bulge and associated complications.  In mild to moderate cases muscle relaxants , NSAIDs and physiotherapy will benefit.

If not start on calcium along with vit D3 and also multivitamin supplements. Also add an antioxidant to it. Also get your general pathology work up done to rule out anaemia and diabetes. If the pain persists even one month after this, then get your back examined by an orthopaedician after doing a xray."},{"Patient":"Hi. I have been feeling a little weird lately.

Pain and cramps in your abdomen might be due to some chronic infection like amoebiasis or even because of  sny stone in kidneys or ureters or even gall bladder as you are having it on the right side.

I weigh 175 lbs and I am 5'8''.  I have a history of hypertension and heart disease.  I had two stents placed in my heart in 2006.

The results are:ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND, 06/28/11        HISTORY       Abdominal pain, gas and bloating.        COMPARISON       None available.         FINDINGS       The abdominal aorta is unremarkable measuring 2.9 cm. Liver measures 16.1        cm and demonstrates diffusely increased echogenicity with posterior        shadowing which would likely obscure an underlying subtle lesion. Common        bile duct measures 3.4 mm. Gallbladder wall thickness is 6 mm. Sonographic        Murphy's sign is negative. Pancreas is poorly visualized. The right kidney        measures 11.3 cm and is unremarkable. The left kidney measures 11.8 cm and        contains a 3 cm cyst. The spleen is suboptimally visualized but appears        grossly unremarkable measuring up to 9.9 cm. No free intraperitoneal fluid        is identified. My doctor has ordered a CT scan of my bladder. Do you think this is necessary?  Because of my heart problems and medications I take, I am opposed to having any type of surgery unless it is a life and death situation.

If it started after valve replacement and abscess there is possibility of vertebral infection and MRI would be ideal investment to rule out it.if he recovers then u can definitely go to any part of the world by July month.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. * The issue with abdominal pain and vomiting indicates possible intestine infection with secondary manifestations of dehydration. * I recommend immediate hospitalisation of the patient with intravenous access to control the pain, vomiting with injection therapy and simultaneous lab work up and CT scan of abdomen & pelvis to find out the underlying issue.

Ive been diagnosed with crohns and IBS. I just started a new workout regiment for the first time and I had alot of blood in the stool again for the first time for over a year now. Ive takin pregnosone and been on humira for several months. Wondering if this is cause for concern.","Doctor":"HI.Thanks for your query.As per the history you have provided you are already suffering from IBS and Crohns- It may be either of it.You are bleeding in intestines in spite of the medicines means you need to get a review.I would advise you the following:Get an appointment with the Gastroenterologist Get a colonoscopy and biopsy to prove what exactly is the problem. Histopathological diagnosis is very important as the treatment of both the diseases is different. I would advise the following investigations and treatment in a such a case:Investigations:*Routine blood investigations like Complete blood picture, blood sugar, urea, creatinine, liver function tests, thyroid function tests.*Urine -routine and microscopy*Stool: routine, microscopy, occult blood, culture and sensitivity.*Ultrasonography of abdomen,*Colonoscopy All these investigations should be within normal limits for one to say you have IBS.Treatment:''STRESS'' = stress is the most important cause of IBS. Please remember and you must have observed that when you do not have stress your problem with IBS is reducedChange of lifestyle.I think 'may be' you are not coping with something. Vacation outside of your area, mobiles phones to be off.You must have noticed already that these changes help a lot. Try to avoid anything which you are / have to do against your will and wish. Getr into the hobbies which make you forget the world around you. Life comes only once, boss."},{"Patient":"I have had lower right back pain for about a month. I went to urgent care almost 3 weeks ago and was told it was probably multiple pinched nerves which are causing muscle spasms. Was told the pain should only last 7-10 days.

I work on my feet all day long and it helps if I sit when it starts hurting and put heat on it. The skin discoloration doesn t itch or anything like that, it just seems weird that it s all blotchy where the pain is. Any idea what I could ask about when I go to the dr tomorrow?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for your query.It seems you are suffering from degenerative disc disease & it occurs due to repetitive overload or stress to the disc & it increases the risk of disc herniation & spinal canal stenosis.The main treatment of such pain is bed rest along with pain killers and muscle relaxants. Muscle relaxants can help with your symptoms if used in appropriate dosage in combination with a potent analgesic.You can get the appropriate drugs prescribed from your Orthopedician after examination.Meanwhile you can follow these measures:- If the pain is severe, you need bed rest till the pain resolves. - Get some analgesics prescribed and apply analgesic spray or ointments.- While resting, keep a pillow under your knees if it doesn't bother you.- Avoid lifting heavy objects.- Back strengthening exercises and stretching exercises daily as advised by a Physiotherapist.- Avoid exercises in times of pain. - Improvise your posture while sitting.- Using an LS contour belt of appropriate size might be helpful in providing support to back muscles.Also, maintain a proper posture while working, sitting and standing. Keep your back straight. Physiotherapy plays a major role in treating such conditions.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"Most of the symptoms I listed are being taken care of with medication.

I would also advise her to add more of roughage and enough liquids in her diet along with a moderate exercise programme depending on her medical fitness.In case no result comes out of the investigations and conservative treatment, I would advise you to consult and show her to a gastro enterologist for a possible endoscopic evaluation of her intestinal tract.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery.

What would you say about cancer in the stomach?","Doctor":"Hi! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.When all the tests mentioned by you came out to be normal, this compels me to think of possibility of coeliac disease/gluten sensitivity which goes very often unsuspected and missed. This is caused due to some kind of sensitivity/allergy of the intestinal mucosa to some component of the food you eat. This could be diagnosed with some biochemical tests and by exclusion and trial of food components in your diet. If I were your doctor, I would refer you to a dietician for this purpose to guide you on your diet. Apart from this, I would also advise you to add more of roughage and liquids to your diet, and avoid eating from outside specially the spicy, fried and fast food. Also I would advise you to get your stool tested for ova and cyst and get it treated if positive. Cancer is a remote possibility, but has to be excluded by your doctors. You could also get your self assessed by a gastro-enterologist for an endoscopic evaluation of your intestinal tract.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Prescription of a proton pump inhibitor and a liquid antacid might help.

Good afternoon. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.All the precautions including birth control pills are not 100% fool proof in protection against a pregnancy. If I were your doctor, I would go for a serum HCG determination to rule this out, and then consider this not to be related to a missed pregnancy. Also I would go for an ultrasound of abdomen to rule out any pelvic pathology for the problem. Over and above, a gram staining and a culture and sensitivity test of the brownish discharge per vagina would also either confirm or rule out a pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) which is not uncommon. Further management would depend on the investigation report and a clinical examination by a gynaecologist in your area. So, I would advise you to take an appointment with a gynaecologist to avoid more trouble of not being treated appropriately.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.When all the tests mentioned by you came out to be normal, this compels me to think of possibility of coeliac disease/gluten sensitivity which goes very often unsuspected and missed, specially if you used to eat fried, oily, and fast food from outside. This is not easy to diagnose, and the best way is to exclude all kinds of fast food you consume in outside eating joints.Gluten sensitivity could give rise to all the symptoms you have described including your weight loss, abdominal pain and nausea.It is usually not thought of and is under diagnosed. If I were your doctor,I would also get some blood tests done, like a serum amylase and serum lipase to rule out pancreatitis which is not uncommon in gall stone disease. If need be an MRI of the abdomen would be needed to rule out such associations, and the management would change accordingly.Till all of the above were done, I would advise you with some proton pump inhibitor, a probiotic, and an anti spasmodic drug for a symptomatic relief.Some modification in your diet like more of roughage, enough liquids, avoidance of oily, fried, and fast food, and avoidance of alcoholic beverages and smoking if you do would go a long way in relieving you of your symptoms.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Just a gas ! this can not be a lone problem, we have to find and treat the reasons:::The commonest causes of bloating at the age of 51 are as follows:Aerophagia- commonest reason is anxiety and stress > you have a classical history of bloating developing in the evening with hardness.

Doctors conformed I had scoliosis and hypermobility among other things but never looked into it that much and whenever I move in a certain way I can t get up again for a good hour or so","Doctor":"Hi welcome to  HCMIhave gone thru your query with great concern . Though back pain is not a un common issue  and  is a consequence of an injury or incorrect posture. The cause is thought to be genetic, the body doesn’t make enough collagen or doesn’t make a good quality collagen, which is the principal structural protein of the body Collagen fibers give strength to ligaments, tendons, bone, skin and cartilage. Hence, the whole body can be structurally weakened!  The ligaments that provide joint stability are loose and weak, which increases the risk of ligament injury or strain and can cause pain. Dysfunctional muscle patterns are common when the joints are significantly stressed, forcing them into unsuitable positions where they suffer strains. It is important to engage in activities that strengthen your muscles. Stronger muscles are better equipped to protect the joints they surround. They provide more stability, thus decreasing not only joint wear and tear, but also your risk for joint displacement.In case of injury there are precautions to be taken with professional guidance. Incorrect posture can be rectified substantially in just a few days with few precautions and Yoga  pracyice . I would like to suggest to approach a good  Physiotherapists  who can help with retraining of muscle patterns and treatment of painful joints but the largest component is self management and therefore your own efforts will help a lot by doing yoga postures  and modifying your food habits & life style  , to srengthen your Immune system  .Your immune system is your defense against diseases the invaders invaders .But when the immune system becomes weak, the disease cells can grow out of control , the disease overpowers .Here you have to work to strengthen your immune system by following a certainregimen --WHICHEVER POSTURES YOU DO  , do them gently  . Over exersion will lead you further sufferings .Out of all medical conditions, pain is the number one cause of insomnia.  Sleep disorders is major cause of chronic back pain .

On Friday night, I went out for a friend's birthday, but on the way to a diner, I started to feel a pain in my lower right abdomen, right above my pelvic bone. As I sat in the diner, the pain went from a dull ache to a stronger, sharper pain. 30 minutes later, as I was walking home from the diner, the pain got worse with every step to the point where I almost couldn't make it walking up the stairs to my apartment. When I finally got home, the pain turned into a very sharp pain that make me cry and wouldn't ebb no matter what position I sat or laid. I was tempted to go to the hospital, but didn't only because I have no insurance, and decided to wait an hour to see if it would go away. After an hour, the pain only subsided slightly, but I decided to wait it out. I fell asleep at some point, and woke up around 8:30 the next morning with only a dull ache where the pain had been. Since that morning, I haven't felt much pain in the area at all - only a very slight ache when I press down very hard on the spot it had hurt so badly before. Any thoughts? Obviously, I should go to the doctor and get it checked, but like I said, I have no insurance, and would rather not go unless it could be a symptom of something very serious and wasn't a freak accident. I should also add that I have one symptom of polycystic ovarian syndrome - facial hair growth, and my periods used to come around every 35 - 40 days before going on birth control 4 years ago. I've since quit using hormonal birth control, but my periods have been coming regularly every 28 days ever since.","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query and an elucidate history. The pain must have been due to torsion of the ovary or a large cyst.

I have frequent indigestion and pain when taking deep breaths. Frequent nausea and diarrhea. Normal ultrasound of gallbladder and dx with fatty liver. HIDA scan came back at 89%. Is this enough to get my gallbladder taken out?","Doctor":"Hi welcome to HCMI have gone thru your query regarding upper back pain . It is a matter of concern .  Dear  .Causes of  your back pain ,you are experiencing may be many , but  in your case as it seems clearly , it is due to deranged function of liver . As your  ultrasound test report  shows  gallbladder  normal  but  fatty liver .The gallbladder stores, concentrates and secretes bile which is produced in the liver. The bile is ncessary in the intestine for the digestion and absorption of fat.  It is also important for lubricating the intestinal wall.  Once the gallbladder is removed, the bile looses its storage space and tends to accumulate in the liver.  The liver organ is considered a fire or pitta organ in Naturopathy /  Ayurveda.  Good health of the liver requires the balance of the pitta dosha . If the liver is overloaded with toxins it will burn too hot and become inflamed causing problems throughout the body.      The imbalance is treated with a combination of dietary and lifestyle changes as well as herbal remedies to increase immunity . I would like to suggest  you to  follow regimen as below to  take balanced diet containing all essential nutrients , fiber ,vitamins , minerals in natural form -fruit veges  ginger ,garlic  fish oil  , & flax seeds for Omega 3 ,  Prepare soup from vegetables like carrot, cucumber, spinach etc. and consume daily.Drink a cup of bitter gourd juice daily. Consume aloe Vera juice 30 ml  mixed with Amla juice 1 spoon  every morning for atleast 15 days for better result .Lemon  juice with water with black pepper  before meals twice , for atleast 15 days  Take Turmeric powder  a level  teaspoon+ Almond oil is very important for our sound mental and physical health and strengthen immune response naturally of it with BF and  & at bed time Have this at least for 20 days .  Take orange juice every morning for better results.Take  papaya daily to keep bowels  clearing Henna powder decoction is also beneficial in curing liver enlargement. In fact,Your body is always fighting something -- an infection, a toxin, an allergen, a food or the stress response -- and somehow it redirects its hostile attack on your joints, your brain, your thyroid, your gut, your skin, or sometimes your whole body .Your immune system is your defense against invaders .But when the immune system becomes weak, the disease cells can grow out of control , the disease overpowers  To strengthen your immune system  do Walk ,Yoga , Pranayam   deep Breathing ,Exercise daily For proper blood circulation , to lose weight if obesity is also the reason for your trouble . Avoid fried fast foods ,tea ,coffee ,white sugar, , chocolate and tomato, banana and even salad should also be avoided or minimized because they weaken the spleen and kidneys.  Spicy foods should also be avoided, especially ginger and cinnamon which tend to congest the liver , alcohol , smoking ,stress ,worry, anger ,Constipation .Make sure that you get enough sleep every nightMeditation also helps sooth the mind helps in detoxifying and strengthening the immune system to enhance resistance from diseases and pave way for healthy disease free life .Take Homeopathic Chelidonium 6 / Thrice a day / Take 4 hourly / for 15 days .Hope this helps solves your query .Take care .All the bestDon't hesitate to come with further query if you have any .It’s important to check with your physician before adding herbs to your existing medications,regarding the herbs that are antioxidant ,have no side effects and go with any therapy of treatment . ,"},{"Patient":"I slipped on my stairs and hit my lower right back, has burning pain and I went to see a doctor who said I don't need X-rays and gave me orphenadrine and naproxen.

So later I got naked, put my boxers around my ankles, and then used them wrapped behind my neck, to hold my legs behind my head . I even tried to autofellate, but failed(and didn't continue trying.). So I masturbated briefly in that position(in a computer chair). when I came, I got an odd sensation in my lower body. I felt fine for about 10-15minutes, and then I started feeling shaky. My abdomen/under my ribcage felt a little sore. But no back/neck pain. Now after 3 days of rest, my neck is bothering me, but it's not painful. And I am paranoid that I have done spinal/brain stem/internal injuries. I'm still a little shakey, which is frightening. I haven't eaten much(in 36 hours I've had some nuts, and a banana), or feel like eating. But I am in no real pain. just a little worn out, and I have a short temper. I just started using a heating pad on my neck, and haven't noticed any change.I have what feels like a full range of motion in my back, neck, and shoulders. My abdomen is still not feeling right.

I started having back issues and pain. This ended up in the middle of a law suite between the car insurance companies. I had to see the lawyers doctors. Lawyers doctors was a Nuero surgeon and another was a chiropractor. They done X-rays and MRI s. They confirmed I had disk disease, arthritis, scoleous, and some buldging disk and bone spurs. They MRI and X-rayed my whole spine. I also seen my primary doctor too. She also did the same test the lawyers doctors did. She also confirmed all the same results the lawyers doctors had. My primary care doctor had another doctor look at it as a second opinion. She at first thought from the first set of X-rays that I had spinal cancer and wanted a second opinion on it. That other doctor she got the second opinion from confirmed that it was just really bad disk disease and arthritis and scoleous and suggested that she have a MRI done on me. I have had a MRI and x-rays done in September 2010 and then again in 2012 of both thoracic spine and lumbar basically my whole spine order by my primary care doctor. My X-rays and MRI s at that time shown a few bulging disk, scoleous, degenerative disk disease and arthritis and bone spurs of the spine. X-rays my primary doctor done in 2010 shown the disk disease and arthritis to be pretty bad along with the MRI in 2010 and 2012. The MRI report in 2012 stated I had disk disease, arthritis, bulging disk, bone spurs, and scoleous. In 2012 after my MRI my primary referred me to a pain management specialist. The pain management doctor has been seeing and treating my issues with pain controll. The pain management doctor also reffered me to a pain clinic for injections and epiderals. The doctor at that pain clinic reviewed my MRI and X-rays and he attempted a epideral that he did himself using X-Ray and he also had my MRI pulled up. He at that time stated he didn t think the epideral would work that I had a lot of disk disease, arthritis, scoleous, and bone spurs that he was also having issues getting the epideral needle up through my spine. They put me on nueroton and refused to do any more epiderals and I have continued to see pain management. My primary care doctor I had been seeing left that practice and went back home to India. So I started seeing another primary care doctor in that same group and still seeing my pain management doctor that my first primary care doctor sent me to. Here recently my legs have started throbbing and going numb and my lower spine throbs. My legs feel week and heavy. They shake when going up and down stairs. I m a nursing assistant and have been for years on my feet and legs for 12hrs a day for the last 14 years. Didn t start having issues with the legs and feet till this last few months. Blood labs have been done and have shown to be normal. This new primary care doctor that s in the same group as my first one who started diagnosing these issues l went and seen him a month ago about the leg issues. He ordered just a lumbar MRI with out contrast. When the results came in he stated I had L5 and L4 that were slightly bulging and alot of nerve inflammation in that area. This primary care doctor asked me if I wanted to go to another pain clinic or see neuro surgery. I chose to go see Nuero surgery. I have been to the pain clinics and had no relief I have continued to feel worse. I seen the nurse practitioner at the Nuero surgeons office who just reviewed the recent lumbar MRI and not the full MRI that was done in 2012 of my whole spine. She stated my lumbar MRI looked healthy and she didn t see any disk disease, arthritis, or nerves being pressed on. Which is totally different from what my primary stated and what the other doctors and specialist have said. This nurse practitioner stated I was not a canadit for surgery. She stated she wanted to have some nerve test done on me. My question is there has been numerous doctors and specialist that have looked at all this and all pretty much have the same opinions on what s going on with my back and creating pain. This nurse practitioner at a Nuero surgeons office is stating something different than the other doctors, specialist, and my primary care doctor. This nurse practitioner says my lumbar spine MRI is normal and healthy. If that s the case why is she ordering a nerve test? Should I go and get another opinion by another Nuero surgeon? I have quite a bit of pain in my back and legs and if it s healthy I shouldn t be having pain in my back and legs like i do. She also stated she wanted to send me to a neurologist. Why would she do that if she claims my lumbar MRI looks healthy to her. Should I get another opinion by another Nuero surgeon? Where should I go from here? Could there be other issues in the upper part of the spine like the thoracic part that was shown in the lumbar spine MRI creating issues in my lower legs from below my knees and down and my feet to go numb?","Doctor":"Hi Welcome to HCMI have gone to through your query regarding back pain, numb feet after car accident .

They don't seem to know what is causing it and seem to be reluctant to think it is anything but psycological.

I'm very active - I have 2 horses, I ride every day, plus general stable duties. I go to the gym and jog regularly. Sometimes these activities hurt slightly, but rarely to the extent I can't do them.

Usually 1-2 days of bed rest will calm severe back pain. Do not stay off your feet for longer, though.2. Avoid lifting weights as it imparts more strain on your back3. Change your daily activities so that you avoid movements that can cause further pain, especially bending forward and lifting as it will worsen the intervertebral disc problems. If you want to bend forwards, do it with your hips and knees flexed.4. Use a lumbosacral back support to stabilize your spinal muscles and to provide support for your spinal column.5. After the initial pain has subsided, remedial exercises to strengthen the spine are very important to restore normal spinal movements and muscle strength. The main aim of exercise is to encourage mobility, reduce muscle spasm, prevent further deterioration in the muscles and speed recovery.6. You should maintain an optimum body weight to decrease the strain on your vertebral column causing more degeneration and arthritic changes.7. At times steroid injections at Facet joint of spine will help in alleviating the lower back pain.8.

Dear, there are many factors causing  back pain as your age ,life style ,food habits , exertion at work place or home ,faulty posture , lack of exercise , mensuration or menopause in case of women . These diseases ,are often addressed by powerful immune suppressing medication and not by addressing the cause . Your immune system is your defense against invaders. It is your internal army and has to clearly distinguish friend from foe -Autoimmunity occurs when your immune system gets confused and your own tissues get caught in friendly cross-fire. Your body is always  fighting something -- an infection, a toxin, an allergen, a food or the stress response -- and somehow it redirects its hostile attack on your joints, your brain, your thyroid, your gut, your skin, or sometimes your whole body.>White people, particularly those of Northern European descent, are at highest risk of developing MS. People of Asian, African or Native American descent have less chance .There are many symptoms of multiple sclerosis; symptoms tend to become more severe as the disease progresses. Common symptoms of MS include vision problems, weakness, memory problems, balance and coordination problems, and a variety of sensations in the limbs such as prickling, tingling, or numbnessUor health depends on 'what we eat ,when we eat , & how we eat 'and what is our life styleGulping on only medicine & antibiotic  will  not help cure unless  you  modify your life style and your food habits .Use  of supplements can be very effective in alleviating and even avoiding the unpleasant symptoms of MS.

Visited Orthopedic he asked me to do MRI scan. Than he suggested me for HLAB 27  report which is also negetive than he asked me to chk with rhemetogist for (ankylosing spondylitis).

I am really looking for excersise to fight with  Ankylosing Spondylitis even thought it is there or not. This for precaution for future.","Doctor":"I have gone through the details provided. Ankylosing spondylosis is a condition where the lower vertebrae get fused, thus creating compression effect on the spinal nerves that come out of openings on either side of the vertebrae. This nerve compression is responsible for the pain over the areas that those nerves supply. Spinal traction should be able to give you some relief. This has to be backed up with proper exercise which need to be done only under proper guidance. Please get in touch with a physiotherapist who can take care of these. It is not possible to demonstrate the right techniques to you (which is not possible in the brief scope of this answer). Moreover, you need to remain in proper follow up. He would also be able to tell you about the postures to avoid as precautionary measure. Hot compress alternating with cold compress should help in reducing the pain."},{"Patient":"Hi I am traveling and need a muscle relaxant to help with my pinched nerve in the back.

There are few reasons for your classical history of pain in the upper abdomen which radiated to the back :-Gastric ulcer on the posterior wall of the stomach;-Pancreatitis.I would advise you the following:First of all get two investigations done- MRI of the abdomen and Upper GI endoscopy. If you have stomach ulcer:Zantac 12 hourly.Pepcid every 3 to 4 hours when on empty stomach. Add Domperidone or such motility regulators.Soft bland diet. No aerated colas / soda/ drinks.Early dinner. No late nights.Treatment for anxiety (as prescribed / needs a prescription by your Doctor)Lying in a reclining positionWalk around after dinner.Think of the factors which increased the present problem, GERD, anxiety and try to avoid. If no relief, get Upper GI endoscopy done and get prescription for added Medicines. EKG for the heart n a safer side to rule out cardiac problems.

Your bowel movements have been disturbed, as a result of which the food is unable to move down steadily, thus causing acid reflux and bloating probably with constipation as well. It is related to the IBS that you have mentioned. Constipation can cause low back pain. You will have to regularise your bowel movements if you need to solve your problems. For that you need to take a high fibre diet. Take fibre supplements like isabgol husk daily with dinner. Alternatively, you may take lactulose syrup 2 teaspoonfuls at dinner. Take small but frequent meals.

UTI may commonly give rise to pain in lower abdomen or lower back. In other words, the blood in urine and the back pain could be related. Please get a urine routine microscopy and culture to be sure.Although kidney stones and diverticulosis are also possibilities, they seem less likely. There is no need to jump to conclusions.

She is still in server pain, still extremely unwell.. Can you shed any light","Doctor":"Urinary tract infection could be a possible cause of low back pain. Please complete the full course of antibiotics and see if she gets relief. Another possible cause of such pain could be improper posture during sitting or lying down which may trigger spasm of the lower back muscles. She needs to learn certain back exercises from a physical therapist and that should help. Hot compress is likely to give her some relief."},{"Patient":"Hi I recently had lower back pain which lasted for more than a month! On taking the Xray, it showed Sacralization of L5 and mild lumbar scoliosis convex to the left with a+1 vertebral rotation at apex of the curve.Is it a very serious problem and what is the remedy for this problem.","Doctor":"Sacralisation of lower lumbar vertebrae like L5 means gradual fusion of the lower lumbar vertebrae as in case of the sacrum where the vertebrae are already fused. Otherwise there is some degree of movement between the lumbar vertebrae. As a result of such fusion scoliosis or a lateral curvature of the spine may occur and the nerves exiting from the two sides of the lumbar vertebrae get compressed resulting in pain. Since it is age dependant degenerative lesion, not much can be done and there is definitely some cause of concern. Please be in the follow up of an orthopedician. Traction and physical therapy with ultrasonotherapy and hot compress should give you relief. Surgery is required in extreme cases but you need not panic as of now."},{"Patient":"I'm 68 in good health but in the last 8 months I have gained 30 pounds even tho I excires and try to eat right I have been have lower back pain on my right side and my right hand ( my little finger) is sore maybe like arthrits even tho I have never had any problems . I just had blood work but it isn't back yet the weight gain is my biggest problem I think","Doctor":"Your problems could well be caused due to rapid gain in weight. The cause of such rapid weight gain needs to be evaluated. For weight gain to occur, the amount of energy taken in as food needs to be greater than the total amount of energy spent. So, needless to say that you need to cut down on the food intake. Take high fibre diet. Exercise regularly with regular morning walk. You may also opt for electrical muscle stimulation therapy that is available at many slimming centres. Get your thyroid profile checked (if not done already) as hypothyroidsm could also be a cause of rapid weight gain."},{"Patient":"I have abdominal pain I have had it for a long time...my pcp does not know what to do...I am not constipated.

Could I be lactose intolerate?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Yes, lactose intolerant patients can have severe cramps and diarrhea. You need to observe your diet schedule to know if you get cramps only when ingestion of foods containing lactose more like milk products. If so, avoidance of such foods will definitely relieve symptoms. Feel free to ask any doubts.

Both of you should have taken a course of an antibiotic and metronidazole and probiotic. If there is a complete relief no need to worry.

Do i need some exercise or i have to meet with doctor? I also take some supplement. Glucosamine sulphate and chondroitin sulphate. thank you","Doctor":"I do not think that the back pain has any relation to your masturbation. At this age, the back pain is rather likely to be caused due to improper posture during sitting or lying down. Certain back exercises would give you relief. Please visit a physical therapist for the same. You may try taking some muscle relaxant tablet twice daily for a couple of days and see if you get relief as it is usually caused due to muscle spasm in lower back. Hot compress will also give you relief. No supplements required. Glucosamine or chondroitin sulphate are for degenrative disease and I do not think that you have those at this age. Please do not self medicate and visit a doctor."},{"Patient":"Husband woke up in middle of night- lower back pain and upper thigh , behind knee pain-  it is a dull pain but severe enough to ask for drugs- he NEVER ask for painkillers.

The age of your husband the duration of onset of the pain is important and you have not mentioned that either. If it is acute, it could have been caused due to some electrolyte imbalance (due to low potassium) where taking juicy fruits like citrus fruits is likely to help.

It is safe except for the fact that it could cause gastritis and hence needs to be taken after full feeds or with some anti-hyperacidity medication. Soma contains a medicine called Carisoprodol which can be given safely for low back pain. If the low back pain is due to muscle spasm, the trigger of the spasms needs to be identified. Generally with some muscle relaxant, such spasms get typically relieved in a couple of days."},{"Patient":"when i masturbate i get a lot of discomfort in my whole back especially up around the base up my skull and also in what i think are my illiacus and psoas muscles.

About two weeks ago my right lung feels a bit heavy and hurts slightly.  I have a slight cough and know that both the cough and the mucuous I am coughing up is coming from this lung.  I am experiencing some unusual back pain which I never had before.  It is not there all the  time.  The first time it hit was a couple of weeks ago.  I just woke up with it (mid to upper back). Felt like I had fallen on my back.  Felt fatigued, heavy limbed (especially my upper arms), had aches and pains all over as if I had flu.  Stayed in bed for the day.  Next day my shoulders and neck ached as if I had pulled muscles.  Cleared after a couple of days but last Saturday a burning form of pain began to radiate from my lower back, down into my buttocks and thighs.  Felt extreme exhaustion and aches and pains all over.

If there are any doubts for bone damages or if your back pain travels down the leg (s), then you need more accurate evaluation and imaging with MRI. If there are no damages in imaging studies, or your back pain is located only in your back, there is possible damage of soft tissues (whiplash).

Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions."},{"Patient":"hello, for about 1 week now ive been having sharp pain in my lower back but on the sides, feel a little bloated but crampy as well. 2 weeks ago i had unprotected sex but the next morning i took the morning after pill, shortly after that is when the pain started. what might be the cause?","Doctor":"Dear lady,whatever you have told as a case history I have gathered that a following taking  contraceptive pill you are havibg lower abdominal pain,bloated feeling and crampy.and yes it can happen as a result of oral pill.In my daily practice I come across  some people who complains of such generalised illness.this is due to tepresence of hormonal elements in those pills.these hormones through their metabolism causes muscle cramps ,water retention and local area irritation.so next time when you have to pop a pill,please be cautious about the side effects it causes.thanks for your patience hearing."},{"Patient":"Hello, my name is Agatha.Sometimes I get the feeling of heaviness in my lower back without any pain.

It felt as if my muscles in my back were being ripped out. I went to the emergency room, With out x-rays they diagnosed me with sacrolitis. However I went to my family doctor and got x-rays then I was refereed to a neurologist. He said the lower part of my spine (Coccyx) was pivoting and moving back and forth. The only way to fix it was with surgery by fusing the spine together. But He told me I'm to young for that. Im only (18).Well recently about 3 weeks ago my lower back started hurting really bad, To the point where id move and want to cry from the pain being so bad. It hurt like that for about a week then just stoped.Last night I was moving some stuff in the basement and when I stood up the pain came back, It hurts horribly when I go to stand up, If I cough or even sneeze, Any movement of my lower spine is killing me. I ended up falling out of bed this morning when I got up. I feel like my lower back is extremly tense and locked up. As if I have to be hunched over when I walk, Because If I straigten my back out I get a sharp sharp pain.On a side note theres something wrong with my ligaments (Joints) they all pop and crack (Knees, Knucles, Back, Fingers, Neck, Ect) I was seen by a bone specialist when I was 13, He told me I have to much nitrogen in my bones.I'm just looking to see what others opinions are on this, I know the best advice is to go to the hospital.

Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. I am not aware if an intestinal mucosa biopsy was done during the endoscopy and colonoscopy or not, which was a must. If done, you did not mention the report of the biopsy.When all the tests mentioned by you came out to be normal, this compels me to think of possibility of coeliac disease/gluten sensitivity which goes very often unsuspected and missed, specially if your daughter was used to eat  fried, oily, and fast food from outside. This is not easy to diagnose, and the best way is to exclude all kinds of fast food you consume in outside eating joints.Gluten sensitivity could give rise to all the symptoms you have described including your weight loss, abdominal pain, nausea, and over and above, low platelet count which might have resulted in the bruises. A platelet count and clotting profile is indicated in this case.It is usually not thought of and is under diagnosed. Also if you are from a developing country, tuberculosis not infrequently could give rise to such symptoms of your daughter.I suggest you to consult a gastro-enterologist along with a dietician on this aspect of the diagnosis, which possibly might not have been considered until now. The gastro-enterologist will be able to diagnose with few biochemical tests along with a possible repeat endoscopy with biopsy of the intestinal mucosal wall, while the dietician can guide you on your daughter's food that she can consume pleasantly.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Your relative has a developmental disorder of her vertebral column which could be in the kypho-scoliotic pattern. The main nerves for the hands and legs go through a large nerve called the spinal cord which passes through a bony canal inside the vertebral column. So if the bony vertebral column bends too much it can put too much pressure on the spinal cord and can cause paralysis as she is probably having now.This is usually the need for urgent surgery from a reputed Spine-deformity Specialist Surgeon who will do an operation to remove the bone which is pressing on the spinal cord and try to bring back the shape of the vertebral column to normal. With this she may have good chance of recovery if she gets the surgery done as soon as possible.Till then please feed her nutritious diet and well hydrated, keep turning her to her sides every 2 hours for regular posture change. Take care of her urination and bowel control. Consult a Specialist Orthopaedic surgeon in Spine as soon as possible for best results.Thanking you.Regards,Dr. AASHISH RAGHU"},{"Patient":"I have had severe lower back pain around L-5 on my left side.

According to your symptoms this looks as acute lumbar muscle sprain in your lower back.Most probably due to sudden jerk.Another differential diagnosis can be lumbar disc bulge leading to sudden onset of pain.Intervertebral disc compresses spinal cord and leads to lower back pain.When such patient comes to our hospital we usually do x ray to rule out any nerve compression.MRI spine will show any disc bulge is there or not.And when muscle sprain is confirmed muscle relaxant, analgesic and neurotropic medication can be started.Till time, avoid lifting weights, Sit with support to back.

So continue the medicines as advised by your Doctor and Vitamin A and D has to be taken in therapeutic dosage. Too much swelling of the upper lip looks to be due to either angio-neurotic edema or infection of the ulcer. The lips have a different tissue structure so the edema can be far more severe than  other places in the body.

I recently visited my doctor, a resident, at the local university hospital. My first visit was due to a small, pea-sized growth on my right clavicle/sternum joint. I had a follow-up visit a month later to check the size. Although the size had not changed, below the clavicle was noticeably swollen. The entire clavicle, and the rib below the clavicle, protrudes more than the left side. An x-ray was ordered and the radiographer mentioned the right side seemed to protrude on the image. I went back today for the follow-up, saw different doctors, explained my symptoms, answered the same questions again, and then again after a team of three other doctors entered the exam room. They will be referring me to an orthopedic specialist in order to determine if this growth is a ganglion cyst. I have no pain or discomfort at all in the joint or bone, I have had a sporadic low fever several on and off the past month, 3 upper body skin rashes, several incidents of burning/itching palms over the past 9 months, no swollen lymph nodes. Sometimes, mild, dull pain in my upper right side back. I don t drink or smoke. I run about 4/3 times per week. I try to eat healthy and rarely eat red meat.

I feel at the end of 2011 and have had progressing problems ever since.. I had a MRI done 2 yrs ago...it says at L2-3 there is a 1.8mm left lateral disc protrusion that causes mild to moderate left sided foraminal stenosis...At L3-4 there is a 1.4mm Left lateral disc protrusion. this causes mild to moderate foraminal stenosis. At L4-5 there is a 1.5mm bulging disc and facet hypertrophy. this causes mild to moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis...At L5-S1 there is a 1.5mm bulging disc and facet hypertrophy this causes canal and mild to moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis.

I had sent my images to the lazer surgery center and they told me that I would need a fusion in this world but that drs would help me...I have been to 3 different nuerosuregons..the last one sent me for a myleogram because I have a spinal stimulator that does not work and he told me that I only have one slight bulging disc and hes not sure where my pain is coming from and to modify my stimulator. My pain management dr told me from my MRI looked like I had a few herinated discs...he then touched my SI joint and I jumped so I know that there is an issue there and he wants to do injections.

Recently, however, pain in the upper left side of my abdomen has begun to annoy me; hence,I submitted myself for an ultrasound examination of my lower and upper abdomen. Since the results show no abnormalities in the organs covered by the ultrasound particularly the liver, I did not go to my doctor anymore.  I just interpreted the occasional mild pain as a result of the fatty food I sometimes eat. Until one day, I was in  a drugstore for my husband's maintenace medicine when I heard a woman buying MX3. Curious about it because of some ads on TV, I inquired how MX3 is.  She willingly shared brief testimonies that made me decide to buy four capsules. Following her advice, I started taking 1 capsule a day before bedtime. After 2 days, I bought another 15; however, these last few days, the pain in my upper left abdomen becomes frequent.  Though still mild and tolerable, I am bothered, So I said I really have to see my doctor. My question then is, why do I feel such after having started taking MX3? I would appreciate so much any explanation and additional information. This is the very first time I research about MX3. Thank you and more power.","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query and an elucidate history. Well, to start with the cholecystectomy 13 years ago may not have anything to do with your present problem as the gall badder is on the right side.

MX3 is Mangosteen capsules are known to contain many important chemicals and nutrients. Some of these include the class of nutrients known as xanthones. It is very good anti-oxidant.But it will have no direct use on pain in abdomen.I would suggest you the following:To get colonoscopy and biopsy done as your problem looks to be due to colitis.

He had heart attacks twice (one minor and one major) 12 years back. He developed diabetes in the last 8 years and takes insulin injection before meals. Offlate he has been having trouble sleeping and has burning sensation in lower abdomen region. He visited multiple doctors, got various test done without much relief. One of the doctors advised him to remove kidney stones which also didn't provide much comfort. During this period he also had issue with his right eye vision which on MRI was found to be \\"Found defect in 6th nerve palsy-Known DM and HTN\\". He is on medication for the same. He has been having lot of trouble lately with the burning sensation and back pain. We've visited multiple doctors but they always say it happens with diabetes without giving any further explanation. Could you please advise how can we go about finding the root cause?","Doctor":"Burning sensation is an indication of damaged small nerves, common in long standing diabetes. Back pain is most likely due to age related changes in the spine and that is not related to diabetes. Spine evaluation is required to look for exact cause of back pain. Any problem in the pelvis also can cause the symptoms he has.. and needs proper clinical evaluation."},{"Patient":"Hi I am 25 years old and suffering from a back pain from last 3years. It was not a constant pain but i used to get it once in 4-5 months . But from last 8-9 months my condition got very worse. Now my pain is constant 24X7. I cant walk or stand for more than 5-8 minutes. So finally i went for a MRI scan. My report says : A disc bulge at L3-L4 and disc herniation (protrusion) at L4-L5 and disc herniation (extrusion) at L5-S1 level causing significant compressive effect over the traversing and exiting nerve roots bilaterally. I consulted with few Orthopedic Doctors , they all r saying to go for a surgery. But one said to go for a physiotherapy. i consulted with one M.P.T (Neuro) he is saying , i can get rid of all this pain in just 3-4 months of regular therapy. I am completely blank what to do or not. Can any one please suggest me how i should proceed. Thanks","Doctor":"Most back pains get better with physiotherapy. Spine surgery is usually required only if you have significant pain going down the legs or symptoms like numbness or weakness in legs. If physiotherapy doesnt help, there are other options like injections.

You were on Depo Provera for 14 years and suppressed the hormonal axis. It will take a lot time for your body-clock of hormones to set us and hence it is better to check hormone levels.

I'd appreciate your advise.I am a 31 year old made who suffered a back injury playing badminton in October 2010. I've been in mild/moderate chronic low-back pain since then. The MRI report shows a minor disc bulge in L3-4 and L4-5 sections. However, since a few months ago, I've have started experiencing symptoms of tingling, pin-needles and mild nerve pain, pretty much all over the body. The tingling/pin-needles is experienced in the head, face, arms, shoulders, legs, and sometimes even inside the eye! The mild, fleeting nerve pains also occur pretty much everywhere, predominantly in the legs. There is no numbness. These symptoms begin as soon as I sit down on the floor, in my office chair or any chair/sofa at home. Sometimes I also feel an mild outward pressure being exerted from the inside of the top of my head and feel a mild pain in the center of the chest. These symptoms alleviate once I stand up and start walking, although I've felt tingling in the head/face when I am standing upright.Are these symptoms attributable to my back injury from way back? Is it compressed/pinched nerve? It's very distracting and worrisome to experience these symptoms.Any advise is appreciated.RanjitP.S:I've consulted a Neurologist and done  numerous tests. My D3 and B12 are within the normal range. My brain MRI and evoke potential tests came out with normal results as well.","Doctor":"well... obviously, a nerve problem. The symptoms involve quite a lot of nerves that do not directly connect to each other. It is common, however, for irritated nerves/spine to cause other nerves to be influenced by the activation of the irritated nerve (called WIND-UP). Often, this occurs In the brain. An overall nerve damper (amitryptilline or gabapentin or pregabalin are used commonly for this; anti-epileptic drugs are used UNCOMMONLY for this)."},{"Patient":"hi..my mom is operated for stone 2month before ...she used have body back pain and leg pain...she used have pain killer for that....she used to take daily one tab. for her brain(its a Psychology problem from last 10yrs )...just 2days back i had shown her to yoshamati hospital of bangalore they suggested to admit and they are expecting some problem in brain. i am too scary ,,pls suggest..as todays hospitals are running behind money...","Doctor":"Difficult to say, not being there.

What step I should do?","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for posting the concern in HCM. My understanding is if you have dry or non-productive cough at night along with chest pain, that is due to severe bronchospasm. Xray chest will also be normal in this case. Some other causes should be excluded, e.g. Gastresophageal reflux disease, esophagitis, peptic ulcer disease, esophageal diverticula etc.You may need clinical examination by a local pulmonologist and further investigations to find out the underlying cause.The following tests may be needed-Complete blood count, CRP, urea, creatinine, electrolytes Pulmonary function test Serum Ig E.You may need inhaled bronchodilator and steroids.For the time being my recommendations are -Good oral hydration Tab Montair LC one tab once daily at bedtime for 7 days.Steam inhalation and gurgle with lukewarm water.For any further information, please write back to me directly.

Disc bulge or prolapsed intervertebral disc can cause disability. By definition, disability is the consequence of any loss or abnormality of physiological, psychological, or anatomical structure or function, whether permanent or temporary. But, different formal sectors of employment in different countries have different policies for people with disability. That policy not only varies across the countries, but also among different organisation of same country. The concerned employer has a list of disabilities for which the employees would get benefit. If an employee is disable by definition, but that disability is not included in the list of the concerned employer, he or she won't get the benefit. The benefits also vary from financial support to work environment modification or some other compensation.However, when a disability is temporary or correctable either by rest or treatment, the employee may be benefited with leave from work for the period of treatment. In your case, even severe PIVD is often correctable surgically. So, whether you would get a benefit of flexi-time or not, depends completely upon the employer's pre-set policies. You need to consult the Human Resource Department and the Chief Medical Officer of your company to know whether you would get a benefit.For any further queries, please write back to me directly.Regards."},{"Patient":"i have central back pain either side of my spine, and my urine is yellow first thing in the morning, but both get better as the day goes on. i am 59, 5 foot 8 inches, and 11 stone 2 pounds, i have had back pain before, but this is not the same, that was lower back pain, usually caused by twisting wrong or lifting wrong at work, this is central, and feels different, otherwise i am, and always have been in good health.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for posting the concern in the HCM.A central back pain with yellowish discoloration of urine should be evaluated for any liver or gallbladder pathology. However, other causes of central back pain and/ or high coloured urine should also be excluded. They are- Pancreatitis or any other pancreatic pathology, Peptic ulcer disease, non ulcer dyspepsia, renal pathology, small intestinal pathology etc.But, the primary thing we need to know to come to a diagnosis is whether you are at all icteric or the urine is only high coloured. A conjuctival examination by a local physician and more accurately a serum bilirubin test would help us understand whether you have jaundice. In that case, the causes of hyperbilirubinemia along with back pain will be evaluated. Otherwise, if it is only high coloured urine, your hydration status, renal function and current medication history should be evaluated.Therefore, my understanding is, you should consult your local physician immediately for further clinical examination and evaluation.

It is confirmed by MRI scan.There are two treatment options.First option is rest in position of relief(generally lateral position with both knee bend),neurotopics such as mecobalamin and analgesics (Diclofenac three times a day after meals is effective). Sometimes strong analgesic(such as tramadol three times a day after meals) is required. Omeperazole before meals  prevent acidity caused by analgesics . This method needs patience as it take longer treatment times sometimes up to  6 months.Second option is go for surgical operation(Discectomy).

Thank you","Doctor":"HiStrenuous exercise can put a lot of burden on back muscles and spine. This could be only fatigue or muscle spasm but still other conditions must be ruled out. An xray low back is a good starter of investigations. X ray will show if there is any dislocation or fracture.Take some restand some pain killer like mafenamic acid 500 mg tablets or capsules three times daily.Take a skeletal muscle relaxant like orphenadrine 50mg with paracetamol 650mg two times daily or tizanidine 4mg three times a day.
