My name is Dr Suresh Raghavaiah. I am a liver and pancrease specialist and I hope to answer your question today. I am sorry to hear about your mother's condition.Gall bladders tend to become thick walled and shrunken in patients who have repeated bouts of inflammation (cholecystitis). This will make it very difficult for the surgeon to remove, especially by laparoscopic (key hole) technique. The normal procedure in such cases would be to do a open cholecystectomy, which involves making a 7-10 cm incision on the abdomen and then removing the gall bladder under vision. The dangers of leaving behind the gall bladder  depends on what the original reason for the surgery was. Leaving behind the gall bladder due to stone disease will put the patient at risk for further attacks of cholecystitis, but a still worrisome reason would be if any cancer occurs in teh GB which would mandate that a open cholecystectomy be done.In summary, I would advice you to consider a open cholecystectomy to avoid future complications.Hope this helps and hope your mother starts to feel better.Please do not hesitate to contact me for further details rxsuresh@gmail.com.Have a great dayDr Suresh Raghavaiah"},{"Patient":"i am a 19 year old female who is having signs of gallstones i have had a gall stone before when i was pregnant and i thought it went away. but now on top of the gall stone symptoms i am also very hot i cant cool down it feels like i am boiling on the inside and thats what is concerning me the most.","Doctor":"Gall stone present as indigestion burping abdominal pain colicky in nature .

My name is Dr Suresh Raghavaiah. I am a surgical gastroenterologist and I hope to answer your question today. I am sorry to hear about your pain.I am sure that you have undergone a Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy. This usually involves making a incision below the belly button to insert the camera. This usually ends up being the biggest incision of the 3/4 incisions made to remove the gall bladder. Normally, this incision is closed using suture material after the surgery is over to prevent a hernia through the incision. Sometimes, some surgeons leave it open, especially if the incision was a small one.The pain and bruising you talk about could be one of two things. You might be feeling the \\"knot\\" of the suture material which was used to close the incision (Rare if absorbable suture was used, a definite possibility if non-absorbable sutures was used) or it could be a small bit of \\"omentum\\" which has herniated through the incision.

Your patient might also need be worked up for a transplant if his condition does not improve.Hope this helps and hope your patient gets to feel better.Have a great day and please do not hesitate to write back for further clarifications.Dr Suresh Raghavaiah"},{"Patient":"I am a 58 year old male and I experienced a UTI a few weeks back, successfully treated with cipro.

Your bp is in normal range & has not dropped significantly to cause dizziness. But still you need to monitor it as one of causes of dizziness is Orthostatic hypotension i.e. fall in bp with change in position (this fall should be >30mm Hg systolic & >15mm Hg diastolic). So you should check your bp lying down & standing.Other causes include neurological causes for which you need to do a CT scan.Keep yourself well hydrated & see a doctor after these investigation.Thanks"},{"Patient":"I am having stomach related problem.On consulting my local doctor I got informed that I have the problem of excess bile formation which becomes so frustrating for me.Whenever bile reflux increases more than the acceptable level ,it raises my anxiety level up to such great extent that I am not being able to sleep whole night.During this time belching becomes very frequent as well as fear.","Doctor":"Hi,How are you? My name is Dr Suresh Raghavaiah. I am a surgical gastroenterologist and I hope to answer your question today.I am sorry to hear all the issues you are having. Bile reflux is very rare condition and it usually happens after a part of the stomach has been removed due to various reasons. I am pretty sure (reading your symptoms) that you are suffering from acid peptic disease with gastro-esophageal reflux. This usually happens due to excessive acid secretion in the stomach. Also during the night, while sleeping acid seeps into the throat and can go into the lungs which causes coughing and sleeplessness.A combination of lifestyle modifications and medications usually can control the symptoms in upto 95% of patients. Avoiding smoking, alcohol, spicy food and heavy meals is the key. Small frequent meals should be the norm. Also avoid citrus fruits. Please do not lay down for a minimum of 2 hours post eating. and while sleeping in the night, make sure the head end of your cot is raised 15 - 30 degrees. An over the counter antacid (pantoprazole, omeprazole etc) has high efficacy in decreasing acid production and this coupled with a prokinetic (domperidone, metaclopramide) prevents the reflux.Your condition is very easy to treat. Please do consult a physician who will be able to prescribe these medications.Hope this helps and hope you start to feel better. Please do not hesitate to write back for further clarifications.Dr Suresh Raghavaiah"},{"Patient":"Recently had an ultrasound done due to continuous digestive problems and disconfort in the upper part of my body.  The ultrasound showed a retracted gallbladder and a swelling on one side of my only kidney.  What causes the gallblader to retract?

My age is 58 years (Male)","Doctor":"Hi, How are you? My name is Dr Suresh Raghavaiah. I am a Liver and pancreas specialist and I hope to answer your question today.It seems by your ultrasound report that you might be suffering from fatty Liver.Fatty liver can be caused by excessive alcohol intake (Alcoholic steato hepatitis, ASH) or due to excessive fatty food intake and sedentary life style (Non-alcoholic steato hepatitis, NASH). ASH is usually the beginning stages of alcohol induced liver damage and is completely reversible if the patient refrains from alcohol. NASH is being much more commonly diagnosed currently owing to poor dietary habits and sedentary life styles of people. High caloric intake, high fatty food intake and poor exercise regimens lead to deposition of fat goblets in the liver tissue leading to fatty liver (which shows up as increased echo texture on USG). This is also completely reversible in the initial stages if caloric intake is limited and exercise regimens are adhered to. If left un-checked, patients usually become obese, diabetic and in final stages may lead to cirrhosis of the liver which will necessitate a liver transplant.I would suggest a healthy diet and exercise regimen. Although there is no time limit on when to get a repeat scan, I would suggest one, once you have succeeded in losing some weight.Hope this helped and hope you start to feel better.

I am sorry to hear about your mother's diagnosis. It is unusual for GAVE to occur by itself and is usually a symptom of Liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension or chronic Liver failure. But given your mother's history she does not seem to be suffering from either of these conditions. The treatment of GAVE is usually done by endoscopic coagulation with which excellent results have been obtained. it is very rare for it to need surgery to treat it.Given the lesion in the liver, she will need to undergo a colonoscopy as well to look for the primary lesion. If all the reports appear normal, and only the isolated segment 4 lesion of the liver is present, then it is very much necessary to get it surgically removed.

But in patients who do not have any symptoms related to it, and in whom the clotting profile (PT/INR) is normal, a gall bladder surgery can be safely completed and a biopsy can also be taken. But there is always a risk of decompensation and hence these procedures need to be done in specialised centers. Coming to the causes of cirrhosis, it is too numerous to list, but most commonly are due to alcohol, fatty liver disease, viral infections (Hepatits B,C), drugs etc. In about 10-20% of cases, no cause can be found and these are termed as cryptogenic cirrhosis.

This is similar to the other test I am scheduled for.  I am not rich either.","Doctor":"Hi ,How are you? My name is Dr Suresh Raghavaiah. I am a surgical gastroenterologist and I will attempt to answer your question.Cholelithiasis or gall bladder stones is a very common finding in scans of the abdomen. 10% to 20% of population will develop stones at some time in their lifetime. Up to 80% of these patients will never experience biliary pain or complications such as acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, or pancreatitis. Hence, most gallstones are clinically \\"silent,\\" and is an incidental finding often uncovered during abdominal ultrasound being performed for another reason. People with such asymptomatic cholelithiasis, however, eventually may develop symptoms (biliary pain) that require treatment, but this risk is quite low. An even lower proportion (1-2%) may develop major gallstone complications. Therefore, expectant management is an appropriate choice for silent gallstones in the general population. The exception is patients at high risk for experiencing biliary complications - Large gallstones (>3 cm) or gallbladders crammed with stones that carry a higher risk of developing gallbladder cancer.In your case because of the pain, I would get operated on. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a fairly simple, safe and routine surgery done in most surgical centers.Unfortunately once the stones have been formed, there is no medications which will help in treating them and there is no treatment to dissolve them.Hope this helps and hope you start to feel better soon.Please do not hesitate to contact me for any further clarifications.Have a great dayDr Suresh Raghavaiah"},{"Patient":"i had an pacemaker implant in 2001, aortic and mitral valve relacement in 1983 and gall bladder operation in 1993.now i have developed lower abdomen pain with enlargement of liver(haemoglobin 10gm/dl,rbc count 3.66mil/cmm,inr 2.14,sgot 64iu/l,alkaline phospatase 354iu/l,bilurubbin total 1.63mg/dlsgpt 50 iu/l bilurubin direct .69mg/dl indirect bilurubin .94 mg/dl,serum amalase 147u/l,creatinine 1.3 mg/dl medicines i am taking now 1)udiliv 300mg twice daily,rablet d once at morn.creone 10000 2 tbs.daily.Unfortnately,after 10 days,i could not get any relief . persistent pain in the centre and right side of abdomen is causing enormous discomfort to me .seeking your advice m.k.nath.(68 years) email  YYYY@YYYY best regards.","Doctor":"No relationship to both these conditions ..liver enlargement in some individuals is normal, about ur pain its look like appendicitis mostly rarely other causes like kidney stones etc..previous surgery can also cause adhesions causing intestinal partial obstruction cause pain..simple ultrasound of ur abdomen can rule out..hope i am helpful..liver enlargement is not the cause of your pain"},{"Patient":"The liver is at the upper limits of normal 16.3cm.

I am sure your doctor meant your \\"Hb\\" is low meaning your \\"hemoglobin\\" is low. thisessentially means you have anaemia which is very easily treated with nutritional supplements.

My name is Dr Suresh Raghavaiah. I am a surgical gastroenterologist and I will attempt to answer your question.Cholelithiasis or gall bladder stones is a very common finding in scans of the abdomen. 10% to 20% of population will develop stones at some time in their lifetime. Up to 80% of these patients will never experience biliary pain or complications such as acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, or pancreatitis. Hence, most gallstones are clinically \\"silent,\\" and is an incidental finding often uncovered during abdominal ultrasound being performed for another reason. People with such asymptomatic cholelithiasis, however, eventually may develop symptoms (biliary pain) that require treatment, but this risk is quite low. An even lower proportion (1-2%) may develop major gallstone complications. Therefore, expectant management is an appropriate choice for silent gallstones in the general population. The exception is patients at high risk for experiencing biliary complications - Large gallstones (>3 cm) or gallbladders crammed with stones that carry a higher risk of developing gallbladder cancer.In your case because of the pain, I would get operated on. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a fairly simple, safe and routine surgery done in most surgical centers.Unfortunately once the stones have been formed, there is no medications which will help in treating them.Hope this helps and hope you start to feel better soon.Please do not hesitate to contact me for any further clarifications.Have a great dayDr Suresh Raghavaiah"},{"Patient":"Hello..................I have just been referred to an Oncologist for a tumor on the outside of my liver.  Hepatocellular Carcinoma after 45 years of Hepatitis C.  I cannot eat food................body keeps rejecting all food no matter how pure and natural it is?  Help......","Doctor":"Hi,How are you? My name is Dr Suresh Raghavaiah. I am a liver and pancreas cancer specialist and I hope to answer your question today. I am sorry to hear about your diagnosis. Hepatitis C causes cirrhosis of the liver and is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). One thing you have not mentioned in your details is your age as this will have a bearing on the type of treatment you will be offered. The treatment of HCC depends on the size of the tumor and the state of the residual liver. if you do not have any other symptoms of liver cirrhosis, then liver surgery can be safely offered to you and teh cancer surgically resected. But if you do have symptoms of Liver cirrhosis, then unfortunately it means that the residual liver will not be sufficient. UIN this scenario, Liver transplant offers the only chance of getting rid of the disease. this will also have the added advantage of getting rid of the old cirrhotic liver and leave you with a healthy liver. Please do get back to me with details like your age, Liver function test reports and your geographical location so I can guide you better.Hope this helps and hope you start to feel better.  Please do not hesitate to get back to me for any clarifications.have a good dayDr Suresh Raghavaiah"},{"Patient":"hello, Hello, I had a full medical yesterday and the only big concerns I had was down to my liver.

Do I need to wait?","Doctor":"Hi, How are you? My name is Dr Suresh Raghavaiah. I am a Liver and pancreas specialist and I hope to answer your question today.Fatty liver can be caused by excessive alcohol intake (Alcoholic steato hepatitis, ASH) or due to excessive fatty food intake and sedentary life style (Non-alcoholic steato hepatitis, NASH). ASH is usually the beginning stages of alcohol induced liver damage and is completely reversible if the patient refrains from alcohol. NASH is being much more commonly diagnosed currently owing to poor dietary habits and sedentary life styles of people. High caloric intake, high fatty food intake and poor exercise regimens lead to deposition of fat goblets in the liver tissue leading to fatty liver (which shows up as increased echo texture on USG). This is also completely reversible in the initial stages if caloric intake is limited and exercise regimens are adhered to. If left un-checked, patients usually become obese, diabetic and in final stages may lead to cirrhosis of the liver which will necessitate a liver transplant.I would suggest a healthy diet and exercise regimen. Although there is no time limit on when to get a repeat scan, I would suggest one, once you have succeeded in losing some weight.Hope this helped and hope you start to feel better. Please do not hesitate to contact me for further details.Have a great day.Dr Suresh Raghavaiah"},{"Patient":"HI I JUST GOT A RESULT ON HIGH LIVER ENZYMES.

In the majority of the cases these do not cause any symptoms to the patient and are detected by scans done for other reasons. But when they start growing or when they become blocked they can cause pain. They can also rarely start bleeding when emergency treatment need to be initiated. when they do become symptomatic, the best treatment would be to surgically resect (\\"cut out\\") the hemangioma. This severity of the surgery will depend on the size and location of the hemangioma, the physical condition of the patient and also his liver function. If for some reason surgery is not feasible, then there are treatment options available which can be explored like percutanous sclerosant injection or blocking of the feeding blood vessels to decrease the size of the hemangioma.Please do let me know the previous treatment reports and scan reports so I can help you better. Hope this helped and hope you start to feel better. Please do not hesitate to contact me for further details - XXXX"},{"Patient":"HI MY BROTHER HAS HEP C AND VARCIEL BLEED.

IS THIS CONSIDERED END OR FINAL STAGE OF LIVER FAILURE? I KNOW YOU CAN NOT TELL ME HIS LIFE EXPECTANCY BUT CAN YOU GIVE ME A GUESS AT WHAT WE ARE FACED WITH","Doctor":"Hello,How are you? My name is Dr Suresh Raghavaiah. I am a Liver transplant surgeon and I hope to answer your question today.The symptoms you are describing suggest a acute decompensation of the liver function. Hepatitis C damages the liver, albeit slowly over a period of 15 to 20 years. It leads to cirrhosis of the liver where the healthy liver tissue gets replaced by scar tissue. This essential leads to a decrease in the number of liver cells (hepatocytes) to maintain normal liver function. Under normal circumstances, even 30% of total liver cells are sufficient to take care of daily activities, but in times of stress more volume is required. Unfortunately in cirrhotics, this reserve volume is not available. So even in times of mild stress (infection, electrolyte imbalance, dehydration, etc) the liver \\"decompensated\\" and leads to all the symptoms your brother is suffering from. Also cirrhosis leads to hardening of the liver and hence blood faces a lot of resistance to flow through the normally pliable liver. this is known as portal hypertension and leads to dilatation of blood vessels in the food pipe (which rupture when pressure increases, as in your brother) and also leads to seepage of fluid into the belly.The treatment rests with finding out what exactly caused the decompensation in the first place and treating it. But the curative treatment for someone in his stage would be a liver transplantation and I hope the doctor s treating your brother guide you in that direction.Hope your brother starts to fell better.Please do not hesitate to contact me for further detailsDr Suresh Raghavaiah"},{"Patient":"hello..i was just found to have one or 2 anechoic cysts in/on my liver. there is a septal wall. my bile duct is enlarged, also.as an aside, my mother passed away 1 year ago from mets liver cancer that started in her bile duct. what type of cyst is this and should i be concerned?","Doctor":"Hello,How are you? my name is Dr Suresh Raghavaiah. I am a Liver cancer specialist and I hope to help you today.I am sorry to hear about your mother and I can understand your apprehension.Anechoic cysts in the liver could well be a simple cyst of the liver which requires no further treatment. But the presence of a septal wall makes me think that the cyst could be infectious in nature. I hope you are not suffering from any symptoms like fever or pain. The dilated bile duct is abnormal, but I will need more history to advise you better.

Is it possible at this age and what are the best hospitals in India particlarly pune to address same. Hoping to hear you soon. regards, Meenakshi","Doctor":"Hello Ms Meenakshi,How are you? My name is Dr Suresh Raghavaiah. I am a Liver cancer specialist and I hope to answer your question today.I am so sorry to hear about your father's diagnosis and I can understand your apprehensions.From your history, I understand that your father has a growth on the liver and by your apprehension, I would think it is a malignant tumor. The treatment of liver tumors depend on a lot of factors, most important being the physical fitness of the patient (not only age, but general fitness) and also the condition of the liver. If the liver is otherwise totally normal we can usually resect (remove) upto 70% of the liver without any problem to the patient. But if the underlying liver is not healthy, then surgical options may be limited. In this case, there are various ablative therapies available which can be done on a day care basis.Mumbai and Pune do have a lot of hospitals which specialise in the care of liver cancer patients, but I am not sure if I am allowed to post them in this forum.Please do write to me at XXXX to discuss the options.Hope this helped and hope your dad starts to feel better.Have a great dayDr Suresh Raghavaiah"},{"Patient":"I have gallstones found through routine ultrasound. I had 3 major attacks so far but avoided hospital. thouhgt I had a heart attack as it was so painful. Can I avoid surgery and get rid of those stones. I am not overweight now but was about 15 pounds. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi ,How are you? My name is Dr Suresh Raghavaiah. I am a surgical gastroenterologist and I will attempt to answer your question.Cholelithiasis or gall bladder stones is a very common finding in scans of the abdomen. 10% to 20% of population will develop stones at some time in their lifetime. Up to 80% of these patients will never experience biliary pain or complications such as acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, or pancreatitis. Hence, most gallstones are clinically \\"silent,\\" and is an incidental finding often uncovered during abdominal ultrasound being performed for another reason. People with such asymptomatic cholelithiasis, however, eventually may develop symptoms (biliary pain) that require treatment, but this risk is quite low. An even lower proportion (1-2%) may develop major gallstone complications. Therefore, expectant management is an appropriate choice for silent gallstones in the general population. The exception is patients at high risk for experiencing biliary complications - Large gallstones (>3 cm) or gallbladders crammed with stones that carry a higher risk of developing gallbladder cancer.In your case because of the pain, I would get operated on. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a fairly simple, safe and routine surgery done in most surgical centers.Unfortunately once the stones have been formed, there is no medications which will help in treating them.Hope this helps and hope you start to feel better soon.Please do not hesitate to contact me for any further clarifications.Have a great dayDr Suresh Raghavaiah"},{"Patient":"your query here...hi doctor basically i am from punjab my sis is suffering from jaundice from last 8 years her normal bilurubin is 2.now a days the level reaches at 6 we are giving her treatment from last 10 days along with 25 bottles of glucose drips but still its increased by 1.kindly tell me the sollution we have done everything","Doctor":"Hi,How are you?

My name is Dr Suresh Raghavaiah. I am a Liver and pancreas specialist and I hope to answer your question today.Fatty liver can be caused by excessive alcohol intake (Alcoholic steato hepatitis, ASH) or due to excessive fatty food intake and sedentary life style (Non-alcoholic steato hepatitis, NASH). ASH is usually the beginning stages of alcohol induced liver damage and is completely reversible if the patient refrains from alcohol. NASH is being much more commonly diagnosed currently owing to poor dietary habits and sedentary life styles of people. High caloric intake, high fatty food intake and poor exercise regimens lead to deposition of fat goblets in the liver tissue leading to fatty liver (which shows up as increased echo texture on USG). This is also completely reversible in the initial stages if caloric intake is limited and exercise regimens are adhered to. If left un-checked, patients usually become obese, diabetic and in final stages may lead to cirrhosis of the liver which will necessitate a liver transplant.I would suggest a healthy diet and exercise regimen. Although there is no time limit on when to get a repeat scan, I would suggest one, once you have succeeded in losing some weight.Hope this helped and hope you start to feel better.

So your husband is a young hypertensive who is on two medications for blood pressure and daily exercise. If he continues to be regular with both exercise and medications he will do fine and will not have any associated issues. Being tired, lethargic and gas problems are not of much worry in BP patients.

He said this could be normal, but because of my ekg, I should have a stress test and ultrasound.  I also am going through menopause and wonder if that has anything to do with it.","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to HCM. Your doctor has said you to undergo a stress test because o suppose he has noticed some ECG changes which may point towards heart disease. Since your ECG is not available it is hard to comment upon. Your fast heart rate and skipped beats can be trigerred with caffeine but can also be caused by underlying heart disease. After menopause, usually the protective effect of estrogen in a woman stops. Hence women are more prone to heart disease after menopause. So please go ahead with the stress test. At this point of time I think that you can wait till three weeks for the stress test and there is no need to do it sooner. Wishing you good health.

A needle (somewhat larger than the ones we use to draw blood) is inserted under the skin into the liver and a little piece of the liver is removed for testing. The liver is a very sensitive organ. If it starts bleeding it can be difficult to stop. Thankfully serious bleeding happens only rarely. Very rare complications include also: pneumothorax (injury to the lung), peritonitis (invasion of bacteria into the peritoneal cavity) and injury to surrounding tissues (including - but not limited to - the gallbladder).Liver biopsy in the awake patient needs very good cooperation between the doctor and the patient. If by \\"bad tempered to put it mildly\\" you implied that she does not have a rational behavior - which may happen in patients with advanced uncompensated cirrhosis - then this might pose a problem for the procedure to be performed safely.If you meant peritoneal paracentesis that is removal of fluid from the abdomen then this is a even safer procedure. A needle is inserted into the abdomen (into a 'safe' location) and fluid is drawn with a large syringe. The fluid ends up in a plastic bag. Inserting the needle into the intestine or internal organs is a possible danger but it is not that easy to happen. I would rather say it's almost impossible if the doctor is careful. I wish you the best for your friend!Kind Regards!"},{"Patient":"Hello, I would like a 2nd opinion. I have had 2 liver function blood tests. The first resulted in an alt reading of 51 - mildly elvated and the 2nd 2 months later  75. During the period between first and second tests, i carefully moderated alcohol intake and try to keep a goo diet. My doctor says come back for another test in 2 months, and not to worry, but should i be concerned at these results which are not normal and may indicate liver damage? Also I asked about wheat intolerance but was told that unless i had diarhhea regularly it was unlikely i had this. any advice please?","Doctor":"Hello,you haven't mentioned other tests like alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyl transferase, aspartate transferase, liver ultrasound, hepatitis C and B testing, bilirubin. Other important points in your medical history include the following:- history of blood transfusion- history of illicit drug abuse- unprotected sexual activity with individuals suspicious for sexually transmitted diseases- taking any kind of medication- other symptoms (fever, weakness, etc)- body weight and height.Overweight individuals may have slight elevations of liver enzymes (like the ones you mentioned) because of fatty liver. Fatty liver is a condition that affects also patients with diabetes and heavy drinkers. Fatty liver can be easily detected with an ultrasound scan of the liver.The ultrasound will also bring out other possible disorders like tumors, gallstones etc.Almost any drug may inflict liver damage and cause elevations of liver enzymes. If you used any drug at all then this is a possible cause of your condition.If you haven't been tested for viral hepatitis (particularly hepatitis C) then I suggest you do. Testing for autoimmune hepatitis as well would rule out that rare but important  and possibly treatable cause.I believe that these are the first things you need to do.Repeat testing is warranted of course. As for celiac disease: it is indeed expected to cause diarrhea but this is not always the case. It can present with subtle findings like liver enzyme abnormalities or iron deficiency. Since this is not so common, I think it would be better for you to carry on with my previous suggestions first.I hope I've addressed your concerns. If you need further explanations on the subject, please ask again.Kind Regards!"},{"Patient":"I  recently had a liver enzyme test and the numbers were elevated.

Shoudn t the results of the HIDA Scan been evaluated further?","Doctor":"Hi, How are you?My name is Dr Suresh Raghavaiah. i am a liver and pancreas surgeon and I hope to answer your question today. i am sorry that you are having these symptoms. An ultrasound can be used to see the contractability of the gall bladder if the first scan is done on a fasting state and a second scan is repeated after a meal. The GB usually contracts to empty its contents into the intestine after eating, esp a fatty meal. Unfortunately this is not a very sensitive indicator. A HIDA scan on the other hand provides real time imaging of the GB and hence can visualise the GB contracting and emptying the radio active substance given into the intestine and based on how much content it empties, the percentage contractility is measured. Your ejection of 6% is definitely on the lower side esp if the function was measured in response to a meal or a special hormone administered during the scan.I take it that they have not found any GB stones on any of your USG scans as it could explain your symptoms.I would advise you to get a amylase level done the next time you suffer a bout of back pain to rule out pancreatitis. Hope this helps and hope you start to feel better.

This is Mr. Roy, I am in Germany for official work. My mother is suffereing with some problem , though my brother is taking care of her but would like to get some help for my mental satisfaction. May I Ask few questions it s related to Galbladder stone... Best Regards, Mr. Roy","Doctor":"Hi Mr Roy,How are you? My name is Dr Suresh Raghavaiah. I am a surgical gastroenterologist and I will attempt to answer your question.Cholelithiasis or gall bladder stones is a very common finding in scans of the abdomen. 10% to 20% of population will develop stones at some time in their lifetime. Up to 80% of these patients will never experience biliary pain or complications such as acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, or pancreatitis. Hence, most gallstones are clinically \\"silent,\\" and is an incidental finding often uncovered during abdominal ultrasound being performed for another reason. People with such asymptomatic cholelithiasis, however, eventually may develop symptoms (biliary pain) that require treatment, but this risk is quite low. An even lower proportion (1-2%) may develop major gallstone complications. Therefore, expectant management is an appropriate choice for silent gallstones in the general population. The exception is patients at high risk for experiencing biliary complications - Large gallstones (>3 cm) or gallbladders crammed with stones that carry a higher risk of developing gallbladder cancer.So in your mother's case if she is currently not suffering from any symptoms and all she has is a small stone in the GB, I would advice a \\"wait and watch\\" policy. If in future she does develop any symptoms like pain, fever, vomitting, dyspepsia, etc then I would get her operated on. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a fairly simple, safe and routine surgery done in most surgical centers.Unfortunately once the stones have been formed, there is no medications which will help in treating them.Hope this helps and hope you start to feel better soon.Please do not hesitate to contact me for any further clarifications.Have a great dayDr Suresh Raghavaiah"},{"Patient":"my ultrasonography report shows that, in liver (i) mild diffuse increase in echopattern , (ii)evidence of abdominal wall hernia in the left lumbar region as described, (iii) normal sonological study of the rest of the abdomen and pelvis . one imp. thing about myself i am a regular alchohal drinker.","Doctor":"Hi, How are you?

I am a Liver and pancreas specialist and I hope to answer your question today.Fatty liver can be caused by excessive alcohol intake (Alcoholic steato hepatitis, ASH) or due to excessive fatty food intake and sedentary life style (Non-alcoholic steato hepatitis, NASH). NASH is being much more commonly diagnosed currently owing to poor dietary habits and sedentary life styles of people. Continued intake of alcohol, high caloric intake, high fatty food intake and poor exercise regimens lead to deposition of fat goblets in the liver tissue leading to fatty liver (which shows up as increased echo texture on USG). Fatty liver is completely reversible if the patient adopts a healthy lifestyle, gives up alcohol, limits his caloric intake and exercises regularly. But If left un-checked, patients usually become obese, diabetic and in final stages may lead to cirrhosis of the liver which will necessitate a liver transplant.You also seem to suffering from a hernia which basically says that your abdominal wall has become weak and that the organs are pushing out. i would advise you to consult a surgeon immediately to get it evaluated, esp with regards to need for surgical correction.

My name is Dr Suresh Raghavaiah. i am a liver and pancreas cancer specialist and I hope to answer your question today. The differential diagnosis of a 3 cm lesion in the liver is varied. It could be a simple infection (abscess, bacterial infection, amoebic liver abscess) or something simpler like a cyst or a hematoma or even something sinister like a cancer. A complete medical history, esp regarding any previous history of jaundice, hepatitis or cirrhosis will help narrow it down. Along with this, blood tests (liver function  test, Serum AFP level etc) will help exclude some diagnosis.Also your report seems to be of a ultrasound scan. You will need a CT scan of the abdomen with contrast for a better definition of the lesion.The treatment will depend what the final diagnosis reached is. It could be just observation, a course of antibiotics or might even need surgery to remove the lesion. I would advise you to please get yourself evaluated by a surgeon, so he can make a diagnosis.Hope this helps and hope you start to feel better.

I am a surgical gastroenterologist and I hope to answer your question today. I am sorry you are having these symptoms. But by the sound of it, You seem to have gotten all the stones cleared from the bile duct. The question is, did the stones affect the bile duct in any way? Long standing stones usually cause infection and later lead to narrowing or \\"stricture\\" formation in the bile duct. This will cause problems, esp if you end up forming more stones in the bile duct and these will not be able to pass down into the intestine. But if your bile duct is healthy, I do not see a reason for prophylactic Surgical intervention of any kind. If the ERCP was straight forward, then I would advise you for a repeat ERCP later (In case you should develop more stones). In my personal opinion a prophylactic Choledocho duodenostomy would be a bit of an \\"overkill\\" esp if the bile duct is normal.Hope this helps you and hope you start to feel better.Please do not hesitate to write back for any further clarifications.Dr Suresh Raghavaiah"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, i was suffering from liver pain(pain at right bttom of chest and sometimes at center of chest. currently i m in chennai. i feel breathing trouble and when i drink water or take food, after taking it gives severe pain. i obsever no other symptoms other than this. and when i keep my hand on my chest i feel some hot temperature. can i know the best doctor in chennai. i feel very very uneasy. i went to a doctor and taken scan, only fatty liver was observed ans no other symptoms like kidney stone, stomach pain was observed","Doctor":"Hi, How are you?

Thank you for posting your question on HCM.From what you have explained here, and the calculations, your friend has a BMI (Body mass index)= 27 which means he is slightly overweight (BMI= 20-25 normal weight; BMI= 26-30 overweight; BMI>30 obesity).The liver function report is slightly higher, which are values who justify the cause might be the fatty liver.Its great that he has stopped drinking, because drinking in itself may cause fatty liver.One of the causes of fatty liver is obesity, so the liver and the enzymes will most probably return to normal if his weight would return also to normal.Other causes may be diabetes, medication, viral hepatitis, autoimmune or inherited liver disease.So if I was your caring doctor, I would recommend a diet with low in fat and carbohydrates, plenty of fruits an vegetables, and physical activity at least 5 times a week starting with 20 minutes and increasing gradually.

I had also an ultrasound of my liver which shows no tumors. The doctor says I need a liver biopsy. I take several Aleve each plus lisinopril and omeprazole 20 mg twice daily. Should I have the biopsy?","Doctor":"HIThanks for posting your query to Healthcaremagic .     There are many causes for raised alkaline phosphatase. Infact raised alkaline phosphatse can also be due to Bone or Intestinal problems apart from liver .    So going for a liver biopsy only for raised alkaline phosphatase is not advisable . If your raised alkaline phosphatase is associated with raised  serum levels of gamma glutamyltransferase then the source of raised alkaline phosphatase is consider as liver .    Even in that case raised alkaline phosphatase could be due to frequent consumption of Aleve. I advise to stop taking Aleve and ask your docotr for a substitute . Also stop drinking alcohol .   Repeat the test after 1 month and revert back .   Any clarifications feel free to ask ."},{"Patient":"I have hashi and just had a baby 7 months ago.

He has been mostly bedridden due to a fall where he substained a compressed fracture. He has had to go to the doctors in an ambulance, is this really necessary to have removed.","Doctor":"Hi, How are you? i am so sorry to hear about your father's condition. One thing not clear form your question is whether the stone in the bile duct was removed. Stenting is normally done after ERCP and stone removal to give the bile duct a chance to heal. Once adequate time has elapsed, the stent no longer serves any purpose and hence is removed. The reason it has to be removed or exchanged with a new one at regular intervals is due to the fact that long standing stents are prone to blockage and infection both of which can have potentially serious consequences. But given your dad's condition, and if he does not have any symptoms like pain, fever, jaundice, etc it is my opinion that you could wait on the stent removal with a very very low threshold to get it removed if any symptoms arise.

Not all hepatitis B patients need treatment (as most patients clear the virus spontanously) and only a minority of them end up being carriers or chronic sufferers.

Course' home remedies,   plz help me","Doctor":"Hi,How are you? My name is Dr Suresh Raghavaiah. I am a surgical gastroenterologist and I will attempt to answer your question.Cholelithiasis or gall bladder stones is a very common finding in scans of the abdomen. 10% to 20% of population will develop stones at some time in their lifetime. Up to 80% of these patients will never experience biliary pain or complications such as acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, or pancreatitis.  Hence, most gallstones are clinically \\"silent,\\" and is an incidental finding often uncovered during abdominal ultrasound being performed for another reason. People with such asymptomatic cholelithiasis, however, eventually may develop symptoms (biliary pain) that require treatment, but this risk is quite low. An even lower proportion (1-2%) may develop major gallstone complications. Therefore, expectant management is an appropriate choice for silent gallstones in the general population. The exception is patients at high risk for experiencing biliary complications -  Large gallstones (>3 cm) or gallbladders crammed with stones that carry a higher risk of developing gallbladder cancer. So in your case if you are currently not suffering from any symptoms and all you have is a small stone in the GB, I would advice a \\"wait and watch\\" policy. If in future you do develop symptoms like pain, fever, vomitting, dyspepsia, etc then I would get operated on. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a fairly simple and routine surgery done in most surgical centers.Unfortunately once the stones have been formed, there is no medications which will help in treating them.Hope this helps and hope you start to feel better soon.Please do not hesitate to contact me for any further clarifications.Have a great dayDr Suresh Raghavaiah"},{"Patient":"HI MY SELF S k BAJPAI fROM INDIA aGE 40 YEARS SINCE LAST 3 YEARS I AM CONTINUALLY FACING JOIN DICE PROBLEM .ALL OF MY TEST IS NEVER FOUND ABNORMAL LIKE LFT ,HY B,SOGT,SPT BUT ALWAYS BILRUBINE FOUND MORE FROM SPEC.SO PL LET ME KNOW THE REASON OF ITS.IT STARTED WHILE SUMMER IS STARTED.","Doctor":"Hello Mr Bajpai,How are you? My name is Dr Suresh Raghavaiah. I am a liver transplant surgeon and I hope to answer your question today.I am sorry to hear about your abnormal tests.But it is very difficult to come to a conclusion based on the facts you have provided. generally an isolated increase in bilirubin with all other liver enzymes being normal occurs in patients with hemolytic disease, where red blood cells are being destroyed at an increased rate. But this usually would have presented with a lot of other symptoms like gall stones, anemia, weakness etc from childhood itself. You will need a peripheral smear of the blood to look for evidence of hemolysis. Some times a small stone in the bile duct may also cause the same.  Please reply back with all the reports so I can make a better diagnosis and guide you in the right direction.

By your symptoms you look to be suffering from complications of cirrhosis (hardening) of the liver. Cirrhosis is usually the end stage of continued liver damage due to various causes like alcohol, hepatitis, etc. Cirrhosis leads to increase in the blood pressure in the veins carrying blood from your intestines to the heart and this in turn leads to dilatation of blood veins in the oesophagus (varices). The varices may rupture and that is why your gastro-enterologist has banded them. Your scan showing coarse echo texture also confirms cirrhosis. But now with your new symptom of \\"losing digestion power\\", I assume that you are feeling weak and energy less. This is usually a sign of early liver failure where the nutrients in your food cannot be processed. I would consider a consultation with a hepatologist to look into your cause of liver failure. You need to be evaluated for infections and also to start looking in the direction of a liver transplant. Once cirrhosis has already set in, unfortunately, it cannot be reversed and liver transplant is the only hope for cure.Hope this helps and I hope you start feeling better.Please do not hesitate to contact me for further details, esp regarding centers which offer liver transplant in IndiaDr Suresh Raghavaiah"},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, In a recent diagnostics it has been observed that I am a fatty liver patient.

My name is Dr Suresh and I am a liver transplant surgeon. I hope to answer your question today. Hepatitis B is a viral infection of the liver. In most patients the body's immune system will successfully clear the hepatitis B virus and the patient will not suffer any ill effects of the infection. In a subset of patients, the virus will remain in the blood for a long time without causing disease in the patient (carrier). In a minority of patients, the virus attacks the liver and leads to cirrhosis and potentially cause cancer of the liver. I am sorry that your dad is suffering from cirrhosis, but am glad that he is being treated for this.The hepatitis B virus spreads from person to person through exchange of body fluids (blood, semen etc) much like the AIDS virus. I understand your apprehension about caring for your dad and I appreciate your initiative to get vaccinated. Before getting vaccinated though, I would advise you to get checked for hepatitis B infection. If you have already been infected, then there is no reason to get vaccinated. if the test is negative, then I would advise you to get vaccinated at the earliest and more importantly get the booster doses till you attain a protective level of antibodies in your blood stream (>10IU).I hope your dad gets better soon and I hope this discussion helped you.

ASH is usually the beginning stages of alcohol induced liver damage and is completely reversible if the patient refrains from alcohol. NASH is being much more commonly diagnosed currently owing to poor dietary habits and sedentary life styles of people. High caloric intake, high fatty food intake and poor exercise regimens lead to deposition of fat goblets in the liver tissue leading to fatty liver (which shows up as increased echo texture on USG). This is also completely reversible in the initial stages if caloric intake is limited and exercise regimens are adhered to. If left un-checked, patients usually become obese, diabetic and in final stages may lead to cirrhosis of the liver which will necessitate a liver transplant.I would suggest a healthy diet and exercise regimen. Although there is no time limit on when to get a repeat scan, I would suggest one, once your dad has succeeded in losing some weight.Hepamerz is supposed to be protective for the liver. It does no help in resolving the fatty liver but MAY protect the liver from undergoing further damage.Hope this helped and please do not hesitate to contact me for further details - rxsuresh@gmail.com"},{"Patient":"Age = 45 resident of Afghanistan job = agronomy and rancher chief comp = heart burn duration = 4-6 months appearance look fat physical examination : 1- anemia ......+ (no anemia) 2 - underweight .......+ ( no underweight) 3 - anorexia........- (yes he has) 4 - with right upper quadrant tender ultra sound examination : liver large and multiple mass in liver chest x-ray ==== patchy and also he is asthmatic his doctors say he has a liver cancer!!! may you guide him what to do.........is it true or no? pleas guide what examination should be done to diagnosis his illness? pleas help me I want to make this as a C.B.L.

I understand that the ultrasound has suggested the possibility of liver cancer. But there are multiple conditions which can mimic liver cancer on a ultrasound including infections, cysts and even spread of cancer from elsewhere in the body. For the definitive diagnosis of Liver cancer you will need a blood test (Alpha feto protein) and a special CT scan of the liver called a Tri-phasic CT scan. If these tests are also inconclusive then a needle test will be required to biopsy the lesion and look under the microscope. In the mean time, please do get a complete blood count, liver function test, blood urea, serum creatinine, PT/INR and APTT test.

I also have the upper part of my body done every year. This is where the doctor checks my stomach? Why I do not know. So, my question is what does it mean when he states that my liver is stable?","Doctor":"Hi, How are you? My name is Dr Suresh Raghavaiah and I am a liver transplant surgeon. Thanks for writing to HCM and I hope to answer your question today.Hepatitis C virus, as I am sure you are aware, damages the liver cells. The liver has an enormous capacity to regenerate, meaning if part of the liver is damaged, then new liver cells are formed to replace the damaged liver (unlike skin where damaged skin is replaced by scar). The problem with hepatitis C is, it is present constantly in the blood and liver and continues to damage the liver continuously. Just like a rubber band can be stretched only so far before it snaps, so is the regenerative capacity of the liver. Depending on how virulent the hepatitis C strain is, over the course of 10-30 yrs, the liver exhausts its capacity to regenerate and just like skin, the damaged liver cells starts getting replaced by scar tissue - this leads to hardening of the normal supple liver - A condition known as Liver fibrosis which later on leads to liver cirrhosis. the problem with this is, under normal circumstances anywhere between 1200 to 1500 ml of blood flows through the liver per min. When the liver is normal and supple, this blood can flow easily through the liver. But when the liver begins to stiffen or harden as in the case of cirrhosis, this blood is met with great resistance during its flow through the liver. This is called as \\"Portal Hypertension\\". So the blood starts to look for alternate routes to return to the heart and the most accessible route for it is through the veins of the food pipe (esophagus and stomach). The problem with this is, the veins in the esophagus and stomach are very thin walled and are not used to carrying this much volume of blood. So they distend to a great degree (a condition called as varices) and sometime even rupture with catastrophic consequences. This is easily diagnosed by upper GI endoscopy where the largely dilated veins can be seen.But in your case, since multiple upper GI endoscopies have not demonstrated any varices, it means your liver has not reached a state of \\"portal hypertension\\" yet and the disease seems not be be progressing or is \\"stable\\".If I was your doctor, I would also get a \\"fibroscan\\" which is a special scan of the liver to look at the amount of stiffness or hardening of the liver. This can be repeated regularly to see the progression of the fibrosis. I would also explore the different treatments for hepatitis C infection. The gold standard is ofcourse a liver biopsy which will demonstrate the exact status of your liver.I hope this helped and I do hope you will get better soon. Plese write back to me if you need any further clarifications especially the treatment options available to treat hepatitis C.Have a great dayDr Suresh Raghavaiah"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 40 years old 175lb, 5-7 and have hepatitis B, my new girlfriend is planing to go and get shots for her protection, she was told it will be 3 shots one month apart for each. Do we have to wait for all 3 shots / 3 months or is it safe after first or second.. I do not want her to get infected and am willing to wait but just want to make sure. Thanks in advance","Doctor":"Hello,How are you? Thanks for writing into HCM. My name is Dr Suresh Raghavaiah. I am a liver and pancreas surgeon and I hope to answer your question today. I am sorry to hear about your diagnosis and I am happy to hear that your girlfriend is planning on getting vaccinated. The reason why booster shots are given during vaccination is to create a subset of immune cells called \\"memory B cells\\". These cells store the memory of the antigen (in this case hepatitis B virus) and will produce protective antibodies as soon as they encounter it the next time (for ex if your girlfriend by any chance gets infected). The creation of memory b cells may require multiple exposures to the antigen - hence the booster doses. Having said that, this holds true to the majority of cases. Some people can develop high levels of protective antibodies even with minute exposure to antigens. The only way to know for sure whether a protective level of antibodies have been attained is to measure the Anti-HbsAG antibody levels (which is done routinely in most laboratories). Some people who are poor responders may need upto 5-6 booster shots before a protective level is reached.So in short, if you want to be sure of the immunity of your girlfriend, I would measure her blood levels of protective antibodies (>10 IU is considered protective). This does not mean I am discouraging you from getting the booster doses - The only way to be fully immune is to complete the vaccination schedule.Hope this helped and hope you get better. Please do not hesitate to contact me for any further details.Have a great dayDr Suresh Raghavaiah."},{"Patient":"I have several gallstones in my gallbladder with sizes ranging from 5mm the smallest and 13mm the biggest. My question is, can a 13mm gallstone can pass a common bile duct of 3.4mm? I don't know if the epsom salt will help relaxed the bile duct and become flexible to let pass the 13mm galstone","Doctor":"Hi, How are you?Thanks for writing in to HCM. my name is Dr Suresh Raghavaiah. I am a Liver and pancreas surgeon and I hope to answer your question today.I am sorry to hear that you are suffering from gallstones and since you have not mentioned any symptoms, I take it that you have none.Gall stones can and sometimes do pass from the gall bladder (GB) into the bile duct and then into the intestine and are then passed out naturally. But this happens when the stone is very small and does not get stuck anywhere during its passage. During its journey from the gallbladder to the outside, the stone, depending on its size, can get stuck in multiple places and can cause serious, sometimes life threatening complications. The first site it can get lodged is the cystic duct (tube draining the gall bladder). This leads to engorgement of the GB and may lead to infection and pus formation in the GB. This will need emergency surgery and antibiotics to take care of.The second site it can get stuck is the common bile duct. Blockage of the bile duct less to jaundice and again infection can set in which can be very serious. This will need an endoscopy (ERCP) to retrieve the stone. The third and most dangerous site for it to get blocked is the lower end of the bile duct after it has joined the pancreatic duct (ampulla of Vater). this is the narrowest part the stone will encounter and hence one of the most common sites for the stone to lodge in. This is very dangerous because blockage of the pancreatic duct could potentially lead to life threatening pancreatitis and its complications. This will also need an ERCP to remove the stone.The final site where it can get blocked is the junction of the small intestine and large intestine. This happens ver rarely and can lead to intestinal obstruction.So in answer to your question, You would rather not have the 13mm son pass through the 3.4 mm bile duct. Please consult a surgeon immediately and consider having a laparoscopic cholecystectomy done.Hope this answer helped you and hope you start feeling better. Please do not hesitate to contact me for further details."},{"Patient":"i m 25 years married man. i have gall stone 1.4 cm and suffering from pain. there is extensive pain in my back lower the shoulder. some doctors suggest me to remove the gallblader. is there any other way so that my stone can be removed instead of gallblader.","Doctor":"Hi,How are you? Stones in the gall bladder are a fairly common finding during USG of the abdomen. But not all gall stones need treatment. In most cases the stones do not cause any symptoms to the patient. This is especially true if there is a single stone. In some cases, when there is a small stone, it can spontaneously get expelled from the gall bladder. This is usually accompanied by pain and occasionally jaundice. The main danger of gall stones is when the stone blocks any of the ducts (tubes) draining bile (impacted stone).In 99% of the cases, the treatment is accomplished by \\"Laparoscopic Cholecysytectomy\\" (removal of gall bladder by making 3 small cuts on the abdomen, guiding the surgery through a small camera inserted). This is a fairly routine surgery and could be done at most hospitals safely. Unfortunately there are no medical therapies available once the stones have already formed.In your case, since it is a single stone which is fairly big, and since it is causing pain, I would suggest you to get the gall bladder removed at the earliest.Hope this helped and please do not hesitate to contact me for further details - rxsuresh@gmail.com"},{"Patient":"my sgot is 41 IU/L AND SGPT 29 IU/L IS I T NORMAL?

I had one CT of the Abdomen/Pelvis 2 years prior and another 5 years prior. Neither of these CTs showed this cyst. Why did it suddenly show up now and can I be sure its not metastatic cancer?","Doctor":"Hi, How are you?I am sorry to hear about your diagnosis, but I would not worry about it.Cysts in the liver are a fairly frequent finding on scans of the abdomen. Most often these cysts tend to be \\"simple cysts\\" and do not cause any trouble what so ever to the patient. That is one of the reason why they can grow upto 25 cms without the patient being aware of it. Some of the other causes for cysts in the liver include certain heriditary diseases (where there will also be cysts in the kidneys) and infections (Amoebiasis). Rarely malignancies can also appear as a cyst. But in all of these conditions, the patients will usually have symptoms from the disease. The current imaging techniques (CT and MRI scans) are very good at diagnosing the nature of the cyst without the need for biopsying the cyst. In your case, it appears to be a simple cyst (based on what you have written). Although mostly asymptomatic, simple cysts can also produce symptoms when 1) they enlarge to a big size 2) when there is bleeding into the cyst or 3) when they develop an infection in the cyst. In your case, none of these symptoms exist. Since the cyst is small, I would recommend a followup scan at a later date to see if the cyst is enlarging.Hope this helps and hope you start to fell better soon. please do not hesitate to contact me for further details - rxsuresh@gmail.com"},{"Patient":"Hi DoctorMy Husband is suffered with cute pancreatic attack he is very unconsciousness due to gas can please suggest us what to do so gas is not make in his stomach and if make it can pass out please suggest me what to do? he is taking Tab Razo at empty stomach and antoxid and Bivon syrup but these medicine cant help him.","Doctor":"hi sorry for the situation  your husband is on.

I am so sorry to hear about your Dad's diagnosis. What is the cause of his pancreatitis?Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas. Pancreas is an important organ which not only produces insulin, but also produces a lot of digestive enzymes which helps break up our food into its elements for absorption. Normally the Pancreatic enzymes get activated only after they are pored into the intestine. In Pancreatitis, due to swelling of the pancreas, the ducts draining the enzymes become blocked. As a result, the enzymes get \\"backed up\\" and as a result get activated in the pancreas itself. This is very dangerous because the enzymes then start \\"digesting\\" the pancreas itself, a term known as \\"auto / self digestion). This will lead to \\"dissolving\\" or \\"liquifaction\\" of the pancreas and hence will appear as a \\"fluid collection\\" on imaging scans. Added to this, because of inflamation, the body will secrete a lot of fluid in and around the pancreas which further add to the size of the fluid collection. Once the pancreatitis resolves, the fluid collection spontanously gets absorbed by the body. But if it does not gets absorbed within six weeks, then it is called a \\"pseudo cyst\\" of the pancreas which will need some kind of intervention to treat it. Based on its size (>6cm) and location, most often, this can be treated by endoscopic techniques. But if there is any evidence of infection or endoscopic drainage is not feasible, then surgery will have to be performed to treat this.Hope this helps and hope your Dad feels better soon.

He just had a seizure and his liver is damaged not sure of the degree.  But our doctor said he can't have one more drink or else he will die. He has tried to quit and went to rehab, nothing is working. They said he has cirrhosis, what does that mean?","Doctor":"Hi, How are you?I am so sorry to hear about your brother. Alcohol de-addiction can be very challenging , both for the patient and for the family. Relapses are common and it takes team-work between the patient, family and the doctors team to treat this.The liver is a remarkable organ in its capacity to regenerate. We can resect (cut out) more than 70% of a person's liver and the rest of the 30% will grow back to normal size within 3 weeks!! The flip side to this is that until the liver is damaged beyond 75%, the patient will not have any symptoms related to liver disease. Just as a rubber band can be stretched only so much before breaking, so is the liver's capacity to regenerate. When it is continously damaged as in case of daily intake of alcohol or viral infection like hepatitis b or hepatitis c, at one point it will stop regenerating itself and leads to scar tissue formation. Scar in the liver will lead to hardening of the liver and the in-between liver tissue appears as nodules - this is known as cirrhosis of the liver. This will subsequently lead to \\"portal hypertension\\"which will result in vomiting of blood and fluid accumulation in the belly. In the initial stages, these things can be managed with medications, but later on the patient will end up needing a liver transplantation.Hope this helped and hope your brother feels well soon.

Is there any difference between normal jaundice and Jaundice with Hepatitis A? What is SGPT and SGOT test in Jaundice? Is it OK for me to intake salt in my food? Also can I consume both Ayurvedic and English medicines together to cure Jaundice? Please answer my queries...","Doctor":"Hi, How are you? I am so sorry to hear about your symptoms.Jaundice can be caused by a variety of reasons including infections, alcohol, some blood diseases and also metabolic diseases. The cause of the jaundice also varies with different age groups. Hepatitis due to viral infections are very common. Among the viral infections, Hepatitis A and E are transmitted by contaminated food and water. Hepatitis B, C and D are transmitted by contaminated blood and body fluids.The good thing about hepatitis A and E are they cause a self limiting form of hepatitis in the majority of people. It causes a brief period of fever, nausea, vomiting and maybe GI upset with the jaundice, but it goes away spontanously without any treatment. In a small minority of people (like in pregnant women) these can cause a severe fulminant liver failure. Once the liver gets damaged, the enzymes stored in the liver cell gets released into the blood and this will lead to an increase in the levels. The SGOT and SGPT levels go up for the same reason. A decrease in the level of enzymes reflect improvement in the liver status. Regarding treatment of hepatitis A, I am not knowledgeable in ayurvedic system of medicine. So I cannot guide you regarding ayurvedic medicines, but there are a lot of liver protective supplements available in the allopathic (\\"english\\") system of medicine and I would advise you to take those. As long as you avoid fatty foods during your acute phase of jaundice, salt intake should be of no concern. Hope this helped and hope you start feeling better soon.

As I understand the patient has developed cirrhosis as a result of hepatitis B infection. Cirrhosis by itself does not cause any symptoms in the early stages, but when it gets complicated by portal hypertension, it leads to bleeding and fluid accumulation in the belly. Also when cirrhosis gets complicated by any infection, it can lead to acute liver failure which is life threatening and will need emergency treatment. The severity of liver failure and the risk of death can be assessed using the MELD score. There are various websites which will allow you to calculate the score                                            (  )The only treatment for someone in final stages of cirrhosis is liver transplant, provided the physical condition of the patient is fit enough to withstand the surgery. Most transplant centers (including ours) have developed protocols to treat and prevent hepatitis B in the transplanted liver. It involves infusion of protective antibodies before and after the transplant and also anti-hepatitis b treatment for the rest of the patients life. The results have been good using these protocols.

I am so sorry to hear about your diagnosis.Benign tumors of the liver are uncommon in general population but are fairly common in patients who take any form of pills with a high estorgen content (oral contraceptive pills, hormonal therapy, anabolic steroids, etc). Hepatic Adenoma is one such tumor which occurs very often in these set of patients. Going by your history, I would strongly suspect that you have developed a Adenoma in your liver. Although these things remain asymptomatic for a long time, they can cause pain due to increase in size. A more drastic complication is sudden bleeding or rupture of the tumor, especially if the lady becomes pregnant (so pregnancy is contraindicated in patients with untreated adenomas). In addition to this, there is also a risk of the tumor becoming cancerous. Follicular nodular hyperplasia of the liver is another possibility, but the current imaging techniques should be able to differentiate the two.The first thing to do after a Hepatic adenoma is diagnosed, is to stop all forms of hormonal therapy. This usually causes a dramatic decrease in the size of the tumor though complete disappearance is very rare. Since a definite risk of cancer exists, most surgeons (including me) would suggest a resection of the tumor. Nowadays, these tumors can be safely resected (\\"cut out\\") using laparoscopic technique. Your description saying it is half hanging out of the liver makes this much more feasible and safer. I would advise you to contact a specialist surgeon trained in this technique and get his opinion.You do not have to alter your diet in any way as this will not affect the tumor.Hope this helped and hope you get well soon.

Can i use any wine , whisky ,cider or beer. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hi, How are you?Fatty liver or \\"steato-hepatitis\\" is caused by deposition of fat droplets in the liver tissue (which appears as \\"echogenic liver\\" on ultrasound). The two main causes of fatty liver are Alcohol consumption (alcoholic Steatohepatits, ASH) and high caloric food intake coupled with sedentary life style (non-alcoholic Steato-hepatitis, NASH). ASH is the early stage of damage to the liver by alcohol and is completely reversible if the patient gives up drinking. NASH is much more commonly diagnosed nowadays owing to high caloric food intake and sedentary lifestyle of most people. Both ASH and NASH, if not controlled will ultimately progress to cirrhosis of the liver which could necessitate a liver transplant in the future.In your case, you seem to be in the very early stages of fatty liver disease (echogenic, but normal size liver with sharp edges). Given that alcohol and high calorie food intake are the main causes, I would advise you to follow a healthy life style. Although alcohol consumption in moderation should not be a problem (not everyday), I would suggest following a regular exercise regimen and limiting you caloric intake. I would also recommend getting your Liver function blood test done as a baseline. This should reverse the fatty changes in your liver.Hope this helped and hope you feel better.

In the majority of the cases these do not cause any symptoms to the patient and are detected by scans done for other reasons. But when they start growing or when they become blocked they can cause pain. They can also rarely start bleeding when emergency treatment need to be initiated. when they do become symptomatic, the best treatment would be to surgically resect (\\"cut out\\") the hemangioma.

My question to you is...I know something has to be done, I have heard of Laser surgery to bust up the stones, Is this an option for me, especially, having large stones and having a gallbladder that if pretty well full....Thankyou for you response,","Doctor":"Hi,How are you? I am so sorry to hear about your symptoms.Stones in the gall bladder are a fairly common finding during USG of the abdomen. You do not need any additional tests to confirm the presence of gall stones. But not all gall stones need treatment. In most cases the stones do not cause any symptoms to the patient. This is especially true if there is a single stone. In some cases, when there is a small stone, it can spontaneously get expelled from the gall bladder. This is usually accompanied by pain and occasionally jaundice. The main danger of gall stones is when the stone blocks any of the ducts (tubes) draining bile. This scenario is more common when the stone is small enough to pass through the gall bladder opening but for some reason gets stuck in the bile duct. This will need a ERCP to extract the stone. This is much more common when the gall bladder has multiple small stones.In 99% of the cases, the treatment is accomplished by \\"Laparoscopic Cholecysytectomy\\" (removal of gall bladder by making 3 small cuts on the abdomen, guiding the surgery through a small camera inserted). This is a fairly routine surgery and could be done at most hospitals safely. Unfortunately there are no medical therapies available once the stones have already formed.Also laser therapy for stones have been utilised in kidney stones and not in Gall bladder stones and hence has no role. In your case, (as I understand) there are multiple small stones. Since you are getting symptoms of pain, I would suggest to get the gall bladder removed at the earliest.Hope this helps and please do not hesitate to contact me for more details - rxsuresh@gmail.com"},{"Patient":"painful urination GOOD MORNING DR.

ASH is usually the beginning stages of alcohol induced liver damage and is completely reversible if the patient refrains from alcohol. NASH is being much more commonly diagnosed currently owing to poor dietary habits and sedentary life styles of people. High caloric intake, high fatty food intake and poor exercise regimens lead to deposition of fat goblets in the liver tissue leading to fatty liver (which shows up as increased echo texture on USG). This is also completely reversible in the initial stages if caloric intake is limited and exercise regimens are adhered to. If left un-checked, patients usually become obese, diabetic and in final stages may lead to cirrhosis of the liver which will necessitate a liver transplant.I would suggest a healthy diet and exercise regimen. Although there is no time limit on when to get a repeat scan, I would suggest one, once you have succeeded in losing some weight.Stones in the gall bladder are fairly common finding during ultrasound scans of the abdomen.

Not all hemangiomas need treatment. Only large hemangiomas and symptomatic hemangiomas need any treatment. Some hemangiomas can cause a dull achy pain in the upper belly, especially the bigger ones. Sometimes the hemangioma may clot and cause severe pain, or some may cause bleeding. Very rarely, they can also decrease in platelet counts. In your friend's case, the size of the hemangioma (16cms) is definitely a cause for concern. But if the hemangioma is located deep in the liver, the chances of rupture are very rare and it is OK to wait and watch and plan for a repeat scan in the near future. If it is actively enlarging in size, then I would consider getting the hemangioma surgically removed. Either way, I think it is worthwhile to consult a liver surgeon to get the hemangioma evaluated.

Sir, what we do. please help.The patient is poor. Thanking You","Doctor":"Hello,A small stone has either been left behind or a new stone has formed in the tube draining bile (pith). In my opinion, she does not need open surgery to treat her condition. She needs an endoscopic retrograde of cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and stone extraction.In this, a camera passed through the food-pipe of the patient and stone extracted from the inside. If everything goes well, the patient usually goes home the same day or the next day. I would advise you to go to a center where the ERCP facility is available.Hope I have answered your query.

I found out it was cancerous 2 weeks ago.  Diagnostics show has not spread anywhere.  However, I feel like it is taking up more and more space in my abdomen.  It is very uncomfortable and my right side and right intestinal is kind of hard and bloated.  I am scheduled for a consult at Georgetown U Hosp on the 30th, but all I can think  is \\"Get this the hell out of me!\\"  The oncologist sugggested surgery to remove asap but the hospitals wouldn't schedule before 30th.  I have a consult at Hopkins on April 4th.  I am having this sense of urgency.  How quickly can something like this progress or move?","Doctor":"Hi David, How are you? I am so sorry to hear about your diagnosis and I understand your apprehension about the tumour. But Liver cancers in general tend to grow very slowly and are generally less aggressive than the other cancers. They usually appear in patients suffering from cirrhosis, esp due to hepatitis c. In your case I take it that your rest of the liver is normal. You also mentioned that the tumour is hanging off the tip of the lobe - this is very good for you for two reasons : 1. There is a very very low chance that the tumor can involve or invade a blood vessel, which would alter your prognosis to the negative to a great extent (very common in tumours growing inside the liver). 2. Surgical removal becomes very easy as the surgeon does not need to go through the main liver tissue to resect the tumor. Although the operating surgeon is the best judge (and also since I do not have access to your scans), in these kind of tumors, he could potentially get away with resecting just 2 cm of the tip of the liver. I often resect these kinds of tumors laparoscopically and you should explore the possibility with your surgeon. I hope this helped and I hope you get better soon.Please do not hesitate to contact me with any further questions - rxsuresh@gmail.com"},{"Patient":"My father is a Liver cirrhosis patient.It is started 4 years back & it was minor.He used to go to doctor & do all the test.this time doctor said AFP is more(208)& increasing AFP is not good.Please suggest is it a dangerous situation.what&where the best treatment available.","Doctor":"Hi,How are you? I am sorry to hear about your father's diagnosis of cirrhosis.AFP (alpha feto protein) is a substance normally produced by the fetal liver when it is in the uterus. Once the baby is born, the liver stops producing this substance so that in an adult the levels of AFP in the blood will be very low. Unfortunately, if there is a liver tumour growing, then this tumor starts to produce AFP and hence its level in the blood increases. So if there is a sudden increase in the blood levels of AFP, especially in a cirrhotic patient, it could potentially point to the development of a tumor in the liver. This needs to be evaluated with imaging studies, an ultrasound to start with, and then with a Tri-phasic contrast enhanced CT scan of the liver. The treatment options will depend on size and number of tumors and also the general condition of the patient. The best treatment for patients with cirrhosis and liver tumor is Liver transplant provided they meet some criteria. If the tumor is small, then percutanous ablative techniques or even resection of a small segment of liver in which the tumor is located can also be done.Please do let me know where you are located so I can guide you to the best center for treatment.Hope this helps and hope your dad feels better.

Please advise me weather my wife should go for operation or wait for some time, as I came to know that some stones are sleeping stones in Gall, They never create problems.","Doctor":"Hello,How are you? Stones in the gall bladder are a fairly common finding during ultrasound of the abdomen. You do not need any additional tests to confirm the presence of gall stones. But not all gall stones need treatment. In most cases, the stones do not cause any symptoms to the patient. It is especially true if there is a single stone. In some cases, when there is a small stone, it can spontaneously get expelled from the gall bladder. It is usually accompanied by pain and occasionally jaundice. The main danger of gall stones is when the stone blocks any of the ducts (tubes) draining bile. The stone can get stuck at the opening of the gall bladder (cystic duct) or in the main bile duct (especially at the lower end where it is joined by the pancreatic duct and together they open into the intestine). It causes bile to back up and will cause pain in the abdomen and vomiting, fever and jaundice. This scenario is more common when the stone is small enough to pass through the gall bladder opening, but for some reason gets stuck in the bile duct. It will need an ERCP to extract the stone. It is much more common when the gall bladder has multiple small stones.In 99% of the cases, the treatment is accomplished by laparoscopic cholecystectomy (removal of gall bladder by making three small cuts on the abdomen, guiding the surgery through a small camera inserted). It is a fairly routine surgery and could be done at most hospitals safely. Unfortunately, there are no medical therapies available once the stones have already formed.In your wife's case, there are multiple small stones. Since you are apprehensive about surgery, I could suggest a wait and watch policy with a very low threshold for operation, meaning I would get the gall bladder removed at the earliest and the mildest of symptoms.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards, Dr. Suresh Raghavaiah"},{"Patient":"Good afternoon. One of my relative is coming from Bangladesh, who is suffering from cirrhosis of lever.

The treatment of cirrhosis depends on multiple factors including the cause of cirrhosis (alcohol, hepatitis, etc) the age of the patient, his physical fitness and if he is suffering from any symptoms due to the cirrhosis. If the patient does not have any symptoms or is only mildly symptomatic, then he will treated with medications only to control the symptoms and prevent any complications. But if his symptoms are severe or not being controlled with medications, then the best option will be to proceed with a liver transplantation.Please do let me know where your place of residence is so i can guide you to the nearest speciality center to get evaluated.Hope this helped and please do not hesitate to contact me for any further details - rxsuresh@gmail.com"},{"Patient":"Dear doctor my recent test result was Hepatitis-B surface antigen (HBsAG) - Non reactive- 250iu/ml, Hepatitis surface antibody (HBeAG)- Non Recative please clarify about my result weather my result positive or negative.","Doctor":"Hi,How are you?

ASH is usually the beginning stages of alcohol induced liver damage and is completely reversible if the patient refrains from alcohol. NASH is being much more commonly diagnosed currently owing to poor dietary habits and sedentary life styles of people. High caloric intake, high fatty food intake and poor exercise regimens lead to deposition of fat goblets in the liver tissue leading to fatty liver (which shows up as increased echo texture on USG). This is also completely reversible in the initial stages if caloric intake is limited and exercise regimens are adhered to. If left un-checked, patients usually become obese, diabetic and in final stages may lead to cirrhosis of the liver which will necessitate a liver transplant.I would suggest a healthy diet and exercise regimen. Although there is no time limit on when to get a repeat scan, I would suggest one, once you have succeeded in losing some weight.Regarding your hernia, I presume it is hiatal hernia (as it was diagnosed during endoscopy). This usually does not need any treatment other than over teh counter ant-acids (omeprazole, pantoprazole etc), but if you are having a lot of heart burn or reflux, then a simple surgery (fundoplication) will be curative.Hope this helped and please do not hesitate to contact me for further details - rxsuresh@gmail.com"},{"Patient":"hi my name is sahil and i am 27 year young guy last day i gone through with a test of liver function and as per my report SGOT is 84 and my SGPT is 113 .

If at all, your pain cannot be managed with simple analgesia, you should be hospitalized and given symptomatic treatment until the underlying cause is known.

I am eating well healthy and taking meds. like I should, and would like to know what my prognosis is can I live for a good while or am I close to death.  I also forgot to mention that I had endoscopy with banding as a precaution.  This was done in Oct. 7, 2011.","Doctor":"Hello Mr Santos,I am so sorry to hear about your diagnosis. By your description, I understand you have developed \\"Portal Hypertension\\" which is a complication of cirrhosis of the liver. This manifests as either esophageal varices which can bleed or as ascites (fluid build up in the belly). Liver cirrhosis also prevents some chemicals in the body from being purified and this can enter the brain leading to sleepiness and confusion (Encephalopathy). Propranalol helps in decreasing the portal hypertension and prevents the varices from bleeding. Lactulose prevents the chemicals from being absorbed from the intestine and so will prevent the confusion (encephalopathy). The prognosis of your cirrhosis will depend on the cause of cirrhosis. Unfortunately ir-reversible liver damage has already occurred to your liver and now the aim will be to prevent further deterioration and prevent complications. If the cirrhosis was due to alcohol, complete abstinence will delay the progression of cirrhosis. If it is due to some form of hepatitis, unfortunately there is not a lot left to do since anti-hepatitis treatment cannot be given in cirrhosis.The best treatment for cirrhosis, especially for someone in your stage is liver transplant. It will not only get rid of the cirrhotic liver, but also treat the portal hypertension completely. I would advise you to actively seek a Liver transplant center and get evaluated for candidacy for a transplant.Hope this helped and I hope you feel better.

I am so sorry to hear about your father's diagnosis. Hepatitis C and Cirrhosis are both risk factors for development of cancer of the liver (HCC). The treatment options for someone with HCC depends on multiple factors 1) Patient condition (age, physical fitness) 2) whether the liver is healthy or not (normal liver vs cirrhotic liver) and 3) when patient has cirrhosis, the clinical stage of cirrhosis (early, asymptomatic vs late stage cirrhosis with fluid in belly). Normally upto 70% of liver can be surgically removed safely without any problems for the patient. But in a patient with cirrhosis, only 30-40% can be removed, that too, only if the patient is asymptomatic and his blood tests are normal. In a patient with abnormal blood tests or fluid in belly or portal hypertension (vomitting of blood), then surgical resection is totally contrindicated. In case of your father, I would like to know more about his blood tests, whether he has any symptoms and also the size of the HCC. Based on these the treatment options may include surgical resection, Radio frequency ablation (Burning of the tumor using probes), TACE (blocking the artery supplying the tumor) or even liver transplantation (age and previous heart attack make him a poor candidate.Please do contact me with his blood and imaging reports so I can guide you to the best possible treatment - rxsuresh@gmail.com.Hope this helps and hope your dad gets to feel better."},{"Patient":"My age is 53 years.

The cause can be very easily found by doing a scan of the belly (ultrasound, CT, MRI etc) and some simple blood tests to look for cancer. You could be treated based on that.

Thanks","Doctor":"Hi,I am so sorry to hear that your wife is in pain. I will confess that a stone in the spleen is not a diagnosis you hear every day. Unless it is a calcified spot in the spleen, which would be much more commoner, esp in the developing world. Normally if it just a calcified spot, it means the spleen had an infection and the body took care of it. So nothing more needs to be done. But if the \\"stone\\" is producing symptoms, then the treatment of choice would be to remove the spleen surgically. But I would make sure that there is no other reason in the abdomen to explain your wife's symptoms. We routinely remove the spleen nowadays laparoscopically so that the patient has minimal pain and has a faster recovery. But this will only be done by surgeons with advanced laparoscopic skills.

The gall bladder (GB) stores bile and empties it into the bile duct through the cystic duct. Stones form in the GB most of the times and is seen as an incidental finding in most USG scans of the abdomen. in most people these stones do not cause any problems and so do not need any treatment. But unfortunately for some it causes infection and inflammation in the GB, necessitating surgery to remove the GB. In your mother's case, the stone is blocking the cystic duct of the GB, causing distension of the GB and I am sure pain and fever as well. Since the wall thickness is normal, inflammation has not set in yet, but given that your mother is a diabetic, she is at a very high risk to develop it. So I would suggest you seek surgical help at the earliest and proceed with a laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (removal of GB). It can be safely done at most surgical centers and is a routing procedure now-a-days.Hope this helped and hope your mother starts to feel better.

A HCV RNA PCR and genotyping of the virus is a must as different genotypes require different treatment and they respond differently to treatment as well.

Which place are you writing from?  I am so sorry to hear about your father's diagnosis. I am sure when you say the liver is \\"burned\\", you mean it has become cirrhotic? The liver is said to be cirrhotic when it has become hard and stiff instead of being soft. The problem with cirrhosis is that it is a risk factor for cancer, and it is very common for cirrhotics to develop multiple cancers. It is for this reason that the doctors advise you for liver transplantation. A transplant will not only get rid of the cancer in the liver, but also get rid of the cirrhotic liver which could become cancerous later. But not all patients are candidates for liver transplant. Whether or not a patient becomes a candidate for transplant depends on his age, physical fitness, cause of cirrhosis (alcohol, infection etc) and any co-exisiting diseases.I hope this helped and I hope your dad starts to feel better. lease do not hesitate to contact me for further details especially for places which offer liver transplant in India - rxsuresh@gmail.com"},{"Patient":"Hi, I got a blood test back with elevated ALT at 80 - all other tests normal, except I have Vitamin D deficiency as well. I'm overweight at 190 and 5'4\\", 44 yo female, but blood sugar was normal and no pre-diabetes indicated. I've lost 25 pounds over the past two years, so on the right trend with that. I have to go back for a liver panel, but in the meantime, I'm wondering if it could have been caused by any of the following: 1. gargling with Listerine; 2. eating too many nuts; 3. taking Melatonin for sleep; 4. taking one advil per day for pain of trigger thumb; 5. stress- a couple of all-nighters within the two weeks prior to test, and a lot of day-to-day stress between job and caregiving responsibilities. I'm trying not to freak out over this test result until after I have the liver panel. If I have fatty liver, I'll make further diet changes I should be/am making anyway. Just wondering about factors that could have made the test a fluke...","Doctor":"Hi, How are you? Where are you writing from?A raised ALT and AST level indicates that liver cells are undergoing some sort of injury. Fatty liver can be caused by excessive alcohol intake (Alcoholic steato hepatitis, ASH) or due to excessive fatty food intake and sedentary life style (Non-alcoholic steato hepatitis, NASH). ASH is usually the beginning stages of alcohol induced liver damage and is completely reversible if the patient refrains from alcohol. NASH is being much more commonly diagnosed currently owing to poor dietary habits and sedentary life styles of people. High caloric intake, high fatty food intake and poor exercise regimens lead to deposition of fat goblets in the liver tissue leading to fatty liver (which shows up as increased echo texture on USG). This is also completely reversible in the initial stages if caloric intake is limited and exercise regimens are adhered to. If left un-checked, patients usually become obese, diabetic and in final stages may lead to cirrhosis of the liver which will necessitate a liver transplant. Paradoxically one of the other main causes of fatty liver is \\"rapid weight loss\\". Also pregnancy could exacerbate it. None of the 5 things you ve stated normally cause raised ALT levels but an over dose of pain killers esp tylenol and some other NSAID s can potentially cause a reversible raise in ALT levels. So you should probably be off the painkiller for a couple of days before the liver panel.I would suggest a healthy diet and exercise regimen also. Although there is no time limit on when to get a repeat scan, I would suggest one, once you have succeeded in losing some weight.Hope this helped and please do not hesitate to contact me for further details - rxsuresh@gmail.com"},{"Patient":"hi doctor , I am Anil age 27, recently I was selected for MNC company as a Accountant in SAUDI.

But your doctor is absolutely right. Unlike hepatitis C, in hepatitis B, there is no need to take treatment if your liver function is normal and if your viral load is low. You will need additional tests to look for other markers of infection and to see if you are infective to others (Hepatitis B PCR, Anti-Hbs ab, Anti Hbc ab, Anti Hbe Ab, and also for hepatitis C). Based on this we can categorise you as a carrier or as someone who has cleared the virus. Most people will clear the virus by themselves without any treatment. Only a minority become chronic carriers and only a minority in them will develop cirrhosis at a later stage.Hepatitis B only needs treatment if the viral load is very high or if the liver is being damaged as evident from blood tests. In the mean time, I would advise you to take precautions against spreading the virus (avoid contact with body fluids).I hope this helped and I hope you feel better soon.

Only a minority become chronic carriers and only a minority in them will develop cirrhosis at a later stage.Hepatitis B only needs treatment if the viral load is very high or if the liver is being damaged as evident from blood tests.Hepatitis C on the other hand is more aggressive disease and most people do develop some form of liver damage over the years. This is the reason why most doctors will treat this disease aggressively in order to obtain a cure. But treatment will depend on the viral load (hep C viral PCR) and the genotype of the virus (1,2,3,4) as different genotypes need different treatment and they respond differently to treatment as well. But the hepatitis C treatment is toxic to the body (damages liver and bone marrow) and so can be given only to those who can tolerate it. If the liver has already been damaged i,e has become cirrhotic, then I think you should start thinking in terms of getting a liver transplant done for your dad.

Before answering your question, I would like a couple of clarifications. You said \\"possible\\" autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). How was it diagnosed? Were there any blood tests done to confirm it? and was a liver biopsy ever done?. I ask this because if the cirrhosis is not due to auto-immune hepatitis, then steroids will not be of any benefit. Provided the diagnosis is confirmed to be AIH, then she has already reached the cirrhotic stage with portal hypertension (fluid in belly). At this juncture you should start thinking about a liver transplant for your mother-in-law, provided her physical status is good. The transplant will not only get rid of the old diseased liver and replace it with a new one, but also the immune-suppressive medications prescribed after transplant will keep the AIH at bay.I am sure there is a good reason why your hepatologist has not already suggested this to you. In case she is not a transplant candidate, then in addition to steroids there are other medications which can control AIH. Drugs like azathioprine, cyclophosphamide and tacrolimus have been used for treating steroid resistant AIH. But these drugs have the potential to cause severe side effects and hence have to be used only under close supervision.Hope this helps and please do not hesitate to contact me for further clarifications especially regarding centers which offer liver transplant - rxsuresh@gmail.com"},{"Patient":"hi, i am a 23 year old male and have a non stop pulsing tingling in my abdomen 4-5 inches to the right of my belly button.

In 99% of the cases, the treatment is accomplished by \\"Laparoscopic Cholecysytectomy\\" (removal of gall bladder by making 3 small cuts on the abdomen guiding the surgery through a small camera inserted). This is a fairly routine surgery and could be done within a cost of 30 thousand rupees at most hospitals.Hope this helps and please do not hesitate to contact me for more details."},{"Patient":"CT SCAN STUDY REVEALS.

ALPHA FETO PROTEAIN = 338.84 , 564.51 , 636.32 HOW CAN WE BRING DOWN ALPHA FETO PROTEIN LEVELS?","Doctor":"Hi,Alpha feto protein (AFP) is a substance produced by the liver, normally in very small amounts. But the levels go up in cases of hepato cellular cancer (HCC). The CT report is suggestive of HCC and is probably the reason why the AFP levels are high. The term multi focal HCC suggests there are more than one lesion in the liver. The most curative form of therapy for HCC is surgery. But given that there is background cirrhosis of the liver, this might not be feasible in your patient. The best treatment in this scenario would be a Liver transplant (provided the HCC meet certain criteria). This would not only get rid of all the cancer, but also replace the cirrhotic liver with a new healthy liver. if a liver transplant is not feasible, either because of patient factors (age, other health conditions, cost) or because of extensive disease, then other choices for treatment include radio frequency ablation of the cancer, Trans cutanous chemo- embolisation (TACE - where the blood supply to the tumor is selectively cut off) or per cutanous injection of alcohol into the lesions.once the cancer gets treated, the AFP levels will spontanously decrease and then the levels can be used to monitor for recurrence of cancer.Hope this helps and please do not hesitate to contact me for further details - rxsuresh@gmail.com"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, As Per doctors report I do not have any cardiac problem, I have gotn through aNGIGRAPHY ALSO , But i AM VERY SENSITIVE & HAVE MY BLOODPRESSURE SHOOT UP SOME TIME, HOW ACN i CONTROL IT. i AM TAKING tELMA 80H in morning & starpress XL 50 in evening ,","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome.I can understand the problems that a uncontrolled bp causes, which you must be going through.You are taking good medications for bp but if bp is not yet controlled another drug can be added to it.Telma can be changed to Telma -H.

Your mom is presenting with features of Liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension with hepatic encephalopathy (ire-relevant talk). Liver cirrhosis is divided into two stages clinically 1. Compensated - where the patient has cirrhosis but absolutely no symptoms and 2. De-compensated - (your Mother) where symptoms of liver disease begin to appear - like jaundice, ascites (fluid in the belly), vairceal bleed (vomitting blood) or hepatic encephalopathy (irrelevant talk, sleepiness). Most patients with early decompensated cirrhosis can be managed with medications which includes blood pressure pills to prevent bleeding, water pills to prevent fluid accumulation and lactulose to prevent encephalopathy. But as liver disease progresses, it becomes more and more difficult to manage the symptoms and at this stage the best option would be to proceed with a liver transplant. This will not only remove all problems associated with the cirrhotic liver, but also replace it with a new healthy one. Ofcourse Liver transplant is not offered to everyone and will depend on multiple factors like age of the patient, cause of liver cirrhosis, social support of the family and so on.

Legs with edema. Lack of appetite, sleeping from approx. 4pm for the night, weight loss approx. 50 lbs. What is the prognosis????","Doctor":"Hi,I am so sorry to hear about your condition. It looks like you are currently in decompensated stage of liver cirrhosis (\\"hard Liver\\"). You are suffering from classical features of portal hypertension (fluid build up in the belly) and other symptoms of liver failure (poor appetite, weight loss, excessive sleepiness, etc). The best available treatment for someone at your stage is a liver transplant. It will completely get rid of the fluid build up although regaining your strength and appetite may take a while. But transplant cannot be offered to everyone and depends most on your current performance status (physical fitness, age, other co-morbid conditions like diabetes, heart problems etc). If it turns out that you are not a transplant candidate, and I presume medications have failed to control the fluid build up, then one of the options to be considered is TIPS. Although it will not reverse the liver failure, it will prevent fluid build up in your belly.

I presume the bilirubin level you are stating is the \\"Direct\\" or the \\"Conjugated\\" type of bilirubin? There are various causes for such a high level of bilirubin and it might be good to know that cancer is not the commonest cause.  A stone in the bile duct or a stricture in the duct is usually the main culprit. But unfortunately cancer of the bile ducts or the pancreas or \\"Ampulla\\" (where the bile ducts open into the intestine) also presents with jaundice.

The AST is mildly deranged at 41. You have a family history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiac disease and obesity (these may be part of the metabolic syndrome).First and foremost, you do need to start on Statins (to reduce cholesterol). The reasons are, your cholesterol is way above the desired range (should be less than 200mg%) and only dietary modifications may not be enough to control it. Secondly, you have a family history of heart disease, hence, you need to take precautions. Your AST level is 41 (which is mildly deranged), but presently that should not be a deterrent not to take statins. Once you start on statins, you need to monitor your Liver function tests. The slight derangement in AST can also be due to fatty liver disease (both alcohol and dyslipidemia are risk factors).Dietary modifications include, restriction of refined carbohydrate, saturated fat and carbonated beverage.

Paracetamol poisoning is the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States, but in developing countries, it is rarely seen. Paracetamol poisoning can cause liver damage ranging from very mild elevation in the liver enzymes to total liver shut down (fulminant Liver failure). The extent of damage depends on the amount of paracetamol ingested and if the patient had any other liver disease before the poisoning. In mild cases, the treatment is continuous infusion of N-acetyl cystiene (? glucose drip) which helps in repairing the damage to the liver.

Normally the GB will appear to be one smooth fluid filled sac (esp if the scan was done after an over night fast). This is because, bile being liquid allows the ultrasound waves to pass through easily. If there is a stone, it will reflect some of the waves back and this will make it \\"visible\\" on the ultrasound. GB \\"sludge\\" is a term used when the bile, instead of appearing as a single smooth layer in the GB appears as two different layers. This happens when the bile in the GB has two different densities, so one \\"sinks\\" in the other. This heavier sludge usually consists of crystals made up of cholesterol and pigments. This usually occurs after a pregnancy, rapid weight loss and prolonged fasting. The sludge usually does not cause any symptoms, but has been blamed rarely for biliary colic, pancreatitis and rarely cholecystitis. But more commonly the sludge usually disappears on its own and rarely requires any treatment.

In the present day there are various treatment options available for a patient with active hepatitis C. But since these treatments have potential side effects, it should be taken only by those who would potentially respond to it. This would require getting a Hepatits C viral load and Genotyping done to decide on the course of treatment.Even in India lots of patients do take herbal medications, but barring some self limiting conditions (hepatitis A, E and such), it is rarely of any benefit in hepatitis B and C and only leads to a delay in the patient seeking active medical intervention.

We routinely resect the tail of the pancreas in patients who develop some tumors of the distal pancreas and they do very well post-operatively.

DR states she does not believe it is related. Can you give some advice, please? This condition prevents me from working full time. Ever since surgery; I can not do the things I use to do, such as cook, clean, lack energy to complete house hold work.","Doctor":"Hi,I am sorry to hear you are having these issues after liver transplantation. The goal of liver transplant is to restore a normal life style to patients who would be otherwise very debilitated due to liver failure. One of the major factors which affects recovery after liver transplant is \\"how sick you were before the transplant\\". If you were bed ridden before transplant, then it takes that much longer after transplant to regain normal body strength as all the muscles would have become weak. Intensive physiotherapy regimens are normally instituted for these patients so that they become completely functional again. Added to this, there are a lot of medications, which the patient has to take, which decreases appetite and also which have potential to cause decreased blood cell counts. This could in turn cause weakness. Also since the immune system is suppressed after a transplant, infections are very common which can again lead to weakness.In your case, it has been more than 5 years since your transplant. It is unlikely that any infection or drug effects are the cause of weakness. Provided your liver function tests are normal,  I would also suggest getting your heart and lungs checked as the most common symptom of any dysfunction is weakness.

Also my blood work was fine liver enzymes etc.","Doctor":"Hi,Fatty liver can be caused by excessive alcohol intake (Alcoholic steato hepatitis, ASH) or due to excessive fatty food intake and sedentary life style (Non-alcoholic steato hepatitis, NASH). ASH is usually the beginning stages of alcohol induced liver damage and is completely reversible if the patient refrains from alcohol. NASH is being much more commonly diagnosed currently owing to poor dietary habits and sedentary life styles of people. High caloric intake, high fatty food intake and poor exercise regimens lead to deposition of fat goblets in the liver tissue leading to fatty liver. This is also completely reversible in the initial stages if caloric intake is limited and exercise regimens are adhered to. If left un-checked, patients usually become obese, diabetic and in final stages may lead to cirrhosis of the liver which will necessitate a liver transplant."},{"Patient":"Hi Docotor i was dignosed with Splenomegaly , aparently my spleen measures 18.7cm (from 12.5cm in 2007) & the surgeon suggested that the only treatment is Splenectomy cause she did a series of Blood test(ct scans, bone marrow biopsy, ultra sounds) & she does't know what caused it to enlarge , if i don't remove it what damage it can causeThanks Karey","Doctor":"If the spleen is enlarged it will lead to dragging sensation  and sometime it can cause pain.

I would also like to know whether you consume alcohol frequently.Fatty liver is evident on an Ultrasonography, as an echogenic liver (i.e. white in appearance) which may be enlarged. Blood investigations reveal altered/deranged liver function tests (raised liver enzymes). There are a number of causes of Fatty infiltration of the liver which may be broadly classified into Alcoholic (due to alcohol consumption) and Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver disease (NAFLD) which may be due to Diabetes, Obesity, Hypertriglyceridemia, consumption of excess fat in diet. Fatty liver is a reversible condition, wherein withdrawal or control of the offending agent leads to resolution of the condition. For eg. avoidance of alcohol or control of diabetes mellitus. If not controlled in the initial stages it may progress to chronic liver disease.I would advise you to cut down the fat content of your diet. If you are obese/ overweight gradual weight reduction is advised. A diet high in fibre content is preferable. You will need to avoid carbonated beverages. refined carbohydrates (i.e. fast food) and alcohol. I would advise you to screen for blood sugar (if you have not done that already) and as mentioned above a liver function test may be needed.The other parameters of your USG are acceptable.

In 2009 my gall bladder was removed because of gallstones. Back then my liver enzymes were elevated. I recently had my enzymes checked and the results were AST 86 and ALT 47. I do not drink alcohol or take any drug or medication. I have been tested for hepatitis and the results are negative. How should I proceed? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello, elevated transaminases have several possible causes. In your case it seems you could benefit from an appropriate diet. Fatty liver is a common cause of asymptomatic enzyme elevation, resulting mainly from increased body weight. Your next step should be a liver ultrasound which is an easy way to diagnose the most common conditions related to elevated enzymes. Other tests might be needed depending on the results of the ultrasound. I hope I've helped you. Good luck!"},{"Patient":"sir/mam,I have just checked my sgpt level. and it is 107. is there anything serious. plus i also consume protein post workout which i have stopped for now, please help me for this. what should be the precautions.?

One year ago I had cardiac bypass surgery and have exercised every day since the surgery.  I have progressively felt better until I went to the physiotherapist who manipulated my back as it had been out of alignment because of the rib spreading during surgery.  Since then I have had ongoing back pain but I have also noticed that I have an ache in my carotid arteries and a bit of a flopping occassionally in my chest. My BP is 89/56 to 100/70's and heart rate 65. I had a bit of a bladder infection a couple weeks ago but it went away on it's own. Should I be concerned about a bacterial infection.  Carotid ache worrisome. Is this type of ache always cardiac related?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to Health CARE Magic Forum. No,  with your history it seems to be noncardiac pain. if you are able to exercise  with no incremental pain or the pain is with movement then it is non cardiac. Caroyids don't cause pain per se . it must be muscular. and yes you should be worried about the bacterial infection and consult a physician ."},{"Patient":"3 years of stomach bloating with pressure, worse in ytop region of stomach.

Just wondering???","Doctor":"Thanks for contacting HCM. Cirrhosis of liver leads to formation of esophageal varices which bleed profusely Alcohol is a known cause of liver cirrhosis. Also in liver cirrhosis clotting is impaired so bleeding is difficult to stop. Smoking also leads to bleeding peptic ulcers. so your sister had all the ingredients for bleeding. Peptic ulcer can be corrected by treatment and esophageal varices can be managed by schlerotherapy or banding. But relapse can occur. Cirrhosis is an irreversible process so she needs to avoid smoking and alcohol at all cost.

Most probably you’re suffering from APD that is acid peptic disease, in which there is increased acid production in stomach from variety of causes,commonest being the stress, cigarette smoking and alcohol. Re consult your treating physician to know about the ultra sound and x ray report and he may prescribe you treatment for burning pain.ALT level of 78 is high but single abnormal reading and single test is insignificant.Hope this answers your question."},{"Patient":"I ve had pain across the belt line and middle portion of my stomach for several months now.

I cannot afford surgery, as I am uninsured, work only part time & have 2 babies to care for. Is there a home remedie solution to this issue?","Doctor":"Dark urine and pale stools accompanied by gallstone pain (in the upper right abdomen) where gallstones have been seen on ultrasound is likely to be a blockage of the bile duct by one of the stones. This is usually treated by an invasive procedure called ERCP. If you develop fever then this procedure becomes urgent since infection of a blocked bile duct is an immediately life threatening condition - you must go to hospital immediately if this happens. If ERCP or surgery are truly not an option, you could try ursodeoxycholic acid, a medicine which helps dissolve small stones. Good hydration and avoiding fatty foods is also a good idea."},{"Patient":"hii doctor my mother diabetic since 20 years 56 years old has been identified with hepatitis c 3years back.was under ayurveda treatment since then . few weeks back my mother had severe stomach ache and was taken to hospital.

Low albumin could be the result of the liver cirrhosis or of the sepsis (generalized infection). The oozing blood may also indicate that the blood is not clotting well, another sign of severe liver disease. Often patients who have an operation can have an exacerbation of their liver failure because of the additional stress the body is under. The doctors can help her with antibiotics, blood products, tight control of her diabetes and vigilant fluid balance monitoring. I sincerely hope that your mother has a complete and speedy recovery although this can take some time, even with the best modern treatment."},{"Patient":"Hi I am a 39 yr old female. Only problems I have had recently was gallbladder removed. About 2 months ago. An now for the last month I m having bad swelling in hands an feet . Worse on right side an worse when I lay down. Mornings are horrible been the doc he looks at them an an rights me a script called Melodican. Been takin them for 3 weeks. Pls help me. It hurts so bad.. Thank u","Doctor":"I think you might mean that your doctor is giving you Meloxicam, an anti-inflammation medicine that treats pain as well as other signs of inflammation like swelling and redness. In any case, swelling in the hands and feet joints that is worse in the morning in a woman of your age is likely to be an inflammatory arthritis like Rheumatoid arthritis or lupus but could also be any number of other diseases - the list is quite long and it can take some skill to sort this out. If the symptoms are no better after three weeks you definitely need to see a doctor. They will ask about additional complaints - heart lungs, abdomen, lymph nodes, rashes, eye problems, etc... and will probably order blood and urine tests. The doctor may also order x-rays of the inflamed joints.This could be a serious illness and this warrants immediate attention by the family doctor or by a specialist rheumatologist."},{"Patient":"hepatitis c i have had chronic hep c since i was 11 at 12 i had interferon n riboviron combined treatment. after 6months they took me off the treatment due to my white blood cell count dropping too low. i have been out of contact with a specialist since then. im now 21 n curious about possible treatments. any suggestions?","Doctor":"HIThank for asking to HCMI really appreciate your concern looking to the history given here I could say that there is no specific treatment available for the Hepatitis C and what ever  treatment available does not have that much promising results but need not worry if the person is having Hepatitis C then patient can complete the average life span, hope this information helps you, take care and have a nice day."},{"Patient":"Hi.

My son has had a full blood panel, blood gasses, chest x-ray and evaluated by an ENT for tonsils or adenoid abnormality. All the tests showed everything was good and within normal limits. However, his temperature seems to drop significantly at night time. It drops to 95 degrees. Tonight, I noticed 1 ear was 95 and was ear was 96 degrees. It was probably because the way he was sleeping. Although, it is still really low at night. A few times, his coloration looked off, almost a bluish color. His coronary doctor said the discoloration wouldn t be because of his heart since the blood pumping in that area was good and not blue. I was wondering why his temperature drops so significantly at night and also if surgery is needed for a fistula so small in size?","Doctor":"Hi, I am sorry to tell you the surgery is important for him.

From your inputs it seems you are already in decompensated stage of liver cirrhosis with ascitis and portal hypertension with bleeding episodes.Get the liver function test  and Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy  done to know the source for your bleeding.If the bleeding source is defined then treatment will be based on it as banding for varices and platelets and fresh frozen plasma transfusion for depletion of clotting factors, depending on the severity and continuing the beta blockers( propronalol or nadolol )Dietary adjustment in  the form of avoiding hard solid foods which likely causative of mucosal injury and adhere to the diet you been following.Have an appointment with your  transplant team to review the functional status."},{"Patient":"fatty infiltration of the liver i have been diagnosed via letter after ultrasound with the above disease. i rarely drink but have been three stone overweight. have recently lost a stone and two pounds. i am on the following medication- ventolin seretide and pariet for a hiatus hernia. the letter also said that i had one galstone. i have had 2 minor pain management procedures on nerves in upper back  5months ago twice. and was on painkillers volterol and mobic due to upper back pain caused by kyphosis . hence the pain management procedures. while my diet is not perfect it is definitely not way off in the fat consumption area. i did take lamisil tablets for fungus toe for 8 months last year. and finished them three months before the ultrasound. thanks","Doctor":"Hi,You need to get treated for the fatty liver at the earliest.

It is a reversible condition. Fatty liver can arise out of excessive alcohol consumption or it may be nonalcoholic (as in obese and diabetics). Certain drugs may also cause it. Grade 2 fatty liver is mainly a finding on USG, where the liver as a whole looks whiter. It is reversible. The fat deposits in the liver cause inflammatory changes and if allowed to progress, may cause hepatocellular injury, and lead to chronic liver disease.The best way to deal with this problem, is to cut down on alcohol intake (if you take it), gradual weight reduction (if you are obese), reduce intake of fat and refined carbohydrates and avoid carbonated beverage. It is advisable to include roughage in your diet. You may also go for a liver function test and viral serology.

Your liver enzymes are within acceptable limits though and you have no other gross abnormalities (no gallstone, normal CBD). Stage 1 fatty liver is reversible. You need a weight reduction (by a healthy regimen, crash dieting not advised as it may aggravate the condition) and reduce the fat content of your diet (mainly the saturated fat).

My physician told me that there is some functional problem with my liver , for which i m under medication now. The history is as below: I m under medications for High Blood Pressure for past 3 years. Medication Prescribed (Olmat-AM) after the diagnosis and other possible test. Symptoms: 1. Light Reddish brown color urination only at the morning first time for 3 days. No other symptoms identified. I drink alcohol around than 400ml - 600ml / day with in 3-4 hours a day. I was drinking for a period of 4 years 20 days / month. Before that i drink occasionally like 3 to 4 days / month. Diagnosis : After that symptom i have tested for my liver function, The readings as follows: 1.Very high level of elevation in SGOT (above 2000) and SGPT (around 2700). 2. Alkaline Phosphate more than 160. 3. GGT is more than 200. 4. Other than the above everything is normal. Apart from than sugar levels, Lipid Profiles & Urine test and Culture were very normal. I have a question in this regard. Once i got the above reading i was advised to test the Liver function after 3 days with out any medications. I have the readings like below: 1. Alkaline phosphate is above 130. 2. SGOT is below 1000 and SGPT below 1400. 3. GGT still the same around 160. Then as per the physician advise i have taken the medication for 5 days and tested again. (Medicine - Liver Aid and Zincovit.) The results shows that 1. Alkaline phosphate is below 60. 2. SGOT is below 70 and SGPT below 300 . 3. GGT still the same around 160. Whole abdomen Ultrasound scan show no abnormal results. I could see with out medication the levels of SGOT / SGPT came down in 3 days and now it looks normal in 10 days. Now question is whether am i still in serious condition and needs mediation always or how long it takes to heal ? Please advise. Thanks in advance.

I have been taking cardace 1.25 mg and ecosprin 75mg since then as advised by my physician. This year, that is on 2nd March I again opted for a general check up and found to my dismay that my total cholesterol (278 mg/dl) and triglycerides (189 mg/dl) levels had gone up. I have been now prescribed Lipikind. Also I have been given iron supplement as my Haemoglobin is 10.3 gms%.

During the period when I had the syndrome I was constantly talking loudly about safety of my family etc. I visited the toilet immediately therafter and was completely relieved for the night.

I recommend you to take Butylscopolamine bromide 10mg, 2 pills twice a day, only when you have pain.If the above precautions, will fail in treating gallbladder calculus, then you will need surgery.To diagnose prostatomegaly right, except Ultrasound you need some other tests, such as:1- Rectal examination (palpation of the prostate through the rectum).2- Prostate-specific antigen test (PSA).3- Urine test.4- Urine culture.The above tests will show if you have prostate adenoma because there is a possibility that you are in first stage of prostate adenoma.You should consult your gastroenterologist and your urologist.

I have elevated liver enzymes for already some time (seen in the blood tests for more than 2 years ago and still present). The doctor at the hospital wants to do a liver biopsy if these elevations remain (By now ALT was around 200). He wanted me to lose weight, and then take a blood test again. I lost some weight and started to do more exercise, and the liver enzymes dropped. (ALT : around 100 u/L) Also I felt better and some symptoms disappeared. However I should take a new blood test after some time again which I did not do because I am rather afraid of this biopsy and wanted to see if I could improve my situation by living healthy and do some exercise. I also had an ultrasound, were all seemed normal. No signs of cholostasis (I think this is blockage of gallbladder ducts) However, lately I again get symptoms that indicate that something is wrong. Those symptoms are sometimes mild pressure at the right side of the abdomen, just under the lower ribs, as if something is blocked or inflamed. Sometimes I feel also a bit dizzy, and not clear in the head. Another thing is a bit darkened skin under the eyes. And a general feeling of not feeling very well. Another symptom is that I have often (dark) green stools, which are fluffy, or thin. I can give you also the results of the latest blood test. I was also tested for hepatitis at my normal physician, where it showed negative, but I don t know if this could be still the case. I would like to get some opinion or advice concerning what disease I might have, what to do about it and what the risks are of liver biopsy. I don t have an alcohol problem, I drink very little since already 2 years. I weigh around 86 kg and measure 1m81.

I have never used alcohol or illicit drugs. My cholesterol remains above normal, but is lower than 16 years ago when I had an MI. What are my chances of dying from liver failure before a heartattack?","Doctor":"Hi, Abnormal liver function tests need not necessarily lead to liver failure. It all depends on the cause and severity of liver disease. Moreover, patients on long term cholesterol drugs (statins) can show some abnormalities in liver enzymes, which can get normalized once statins are stopped.   So, stop worrying about your liver and consult a gastroenterologist, who will try to stage your disease and tell the prognosis.All the best."},{"Patient":"1.

Because taking alcohol may further damage the liver and may worsen your hepatitis.As your bilirubin level is under control, you can return to farm work.Drink plenty of water and avoid dehydration.Have bland diet and Vegetarian diet for three to four weeks.Maintain you weight and cholesterol level with in normal limits.Hope this helps.Please write back for further queries.Wishing you good health."},{"Patient":"I get short of breath sometimes at night when just sitting down, my pulse is usually under 60per min more under 57per min should I be concerned?..

People who are physically active can have Heart Rate around 55-60. If you are not feeling any dizziness or syncope like thing then you should not worry about heart rate part too. You can get your ECG done to check for rhythm abnormality, most likely it should not be there.Sometime candesarten ( Atacand) can cause dizziness, bronchitis or cough.

Are they stones (cholelithiasis) or infection (cholecystitis)?Given that I haven't reviewed your cardiac & pulmonary history, I don't know if you're truly \\"inoperable\\". Assuming you are, you can have a cholecystotomy tube placed (it's a tube that is inserted through the skin into the gall bladder to help drain out infected contents). It's the way to go for those with cholecystitis who are not good surgical candidates. An interventional radiologist will typically be inserting such a tube.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Just have gallbladder surgery 2/12/2014.I am having the same pains as I had before surgery.My doctor says it s normal to feel this way and I will be fine.Said the operation went well,no problems.Yes i did have gallstones,many according to Dr.What can this be?","Doctor":"Hi ! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Even though it is too early to comment on this post operative pain in your abdomen, if I were your doctor, I would advise you for a review ultrasound abdomen to rule out any left over stone in the common bile duct as there were multiple gall stones as per your history. Also the condition of the pancreas could be known from the ultrasound report. I would also advise for some routine blood tests for you like CBC, LFT, and also a serum amylase and lipase estimation. Further management depends on the reports of the investigations.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

So vaginal bleeding seems to be a separate entity,following your delivery in March. If you are breast feeding/ weaning, you are likely to get menstrual irregularity due to hormonal imbalance.  you need to get treatment for excessive bleeding,as it leads to anemia & weakness,which in turns increases bleeding.   Please visit your Gynecologist & give your detailed history. You will be subjected to detailed physical examination, blood testing& genital ultrasonography if needed. this will point out the causative factor-followed by treatment plan.   usually a course of hormones is given for three months,along with healthy diet/iron,vitamin,calcium supplement.in such cases to  help in normalizing menses.

I read very carefully your concerns.The sensation of heart squeezing followed by numbness of the left arm, in mos cases is caused by a problem of the heart vassels called coronary arteries.

In this cases the muscle of the heart it is not supplied with blood and oxygen,wich casuses the death the cells of that part of the muscle. If that blockage of the artery persist for a long time, there are great chances of ireversible cell damages.In this situation it is better to ask some more specific questios like: for how long do you feel this symptomes? How did they start? What you were doing when the sypmtomes started? Do you have difficulty in breathing?

Depending on the condition of the liver and the overall health of the patient, there may be other liver surgeries and options that the doctors at Global Hospitals could explore. A partial hepatectomy or liver resection is one such option. In such a procedure only a part of the liver that has been damaged or had the cancer is removed. Other options include liver trauma surgery, pancreatic surgery in case the cancer requires complex restructions, gall bladder surgery, portal hypertension surgery, liver cyst or abscess drainage, and resection and biliary reconstruction surgery.In the hands of the best liver transplant doctors in India, patients have the best possible chance at getting a positive outcome in cases of liver disease procedures and surgeries.

But they can be more prominent during chronic anemia or thyroid dysfunction. From the other hand an aneurysm of the abdominal aorta can not be excluded either. For this reason, I would recommend consulting with your attending physician for a careful physical exam and some tests: - a chest X ray study- a resting ECG- an abdominal ultrasound- complete blood count for anemia- thyroid hormone levels for thyroid dysfunction- blood electrolytes for electrolyte imbalance.

You need through physical examination and investigations to say as medically fit or unfit.Hope this helps.Please write back for further queries.Wishing you good health."},{"Patient":"my mom has been sick, stomach pain when she eats, lost a lot of weight & blood sugars are high, fasting or even if she hasn t eaten anything. went in to doctor to find out more, they did sono & ct scan. No gall stones, however she has a half dollar size spot on her pancreas, liver & gallbladder. She has never smoked or drank. She is 72 years old. What could this be?","Doctor":"Hi there,Thanks for your query.Firstly, your mom is suffering from diabetes Type II. Ask her doctor to control her sugar levels at the earliest, with anti-diabetic drugs.The spots are either due to deposits of calcium in the affected organs; old parasitic infections which-following healing- have now been 'buried' in calcium grave; or, may be metastases from a distant underlying/undiagnosed malignancy.You have not mentioned the opinion given by the radiologist, which would have given me invaluable input.Stomach pain is apparently due to stomach ulcers or hyperacidity without presence of ulcers. Consult your doctor and apprise him of my opinion. I am certain that he will agree with me, order required tests, and- based on the reports-  will prescribe suitable/modified treatment as advised.If you find my response helpful and informative, do not forget an “excellent” (5-star rating)  to my answer, to ENCOURAGE ALL doctors- engaged in social service- to render sound advice to the FREE queries.

The pain is felt more at the RUQ. So, if you are feeling a chest pain (location is important to determine which organ might most likely be responsible), then your doctor should be able to rule out the most likely cause which could be from oesophagus, gallbladder, gastric mucosa and heart. Depending on the characteristic and location, a definitive conclusion should be reached.Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"I ve had diarrhea for two solid months; it started suddenly. all blood work and stool tests are normal (with exception of lipase.)Primary found a lump on my colon, ct. looked normal.(small cyst on liver) Constant bloating, gas and pain along with distended stomach.

About 6 weeks ago I got a really intense pain that comes in waves at the top of my stomach. The pain is so bad and on the same pain scale as contractions, only higher up between my ribs. Within the 6 weeks I ve had this pain on 3 seperate occasions and each time it s been followed by dirrahrea. It usually lasts about 2 days. 4 weeks ago I took a really sharp pain in behind my rib on my right side that went up into my right shoulder. The pain came on me very quickly and I couldn t lie down or take deep breaths as the pain was so bad, I was so worried I went to a&e, on arrival I had a high temp, pulse over 100 and low blood pressure. Doctor did an X-ray which came back clear, and done a ct scan as they suspected PE, this also came back clear. They told me my bloods came back that I had infection somewhere but they just didn t know where and sent me home with antibiotics. 4 days later I went back as I didn t feel 1 bit better, done another X-ray which was clear, more bloods and tested my liver this time as they were thinkin maybe gallbladder, al bloods came back clear, my liver slightly elevated but nothing to worry about , I think it came back 41 and doc said its usually 36, only bloods still showed infection, but doctor was baffled as to where the infection was. I got sent home with stronger anti biotics, I started to feel a bit better within 2 days but I still kept the pain for about 2 weeks after. Since all this I have been to my own GP, she redone my bloods , all came back clear accept my liver ggt which was slightly raised but not raised enough to do anything about.

The Diarrhea is constant and I don t always make it to the bathroom in time. It is orange with allot of mucus and very liquidy.

Due to partial pancreas removal sometimes the pancreas enzymes are secreted outside the pancreas (to the fatty tissue). This is the most probable reason of necrosis. Diarrhea with lots of mucus is characteristic for pancreas insufficiency. Due to lack of enzymes which normally digest fat, diarrhea appears. That is why you should try pancreas enzymes supplementation with every meal along with special diet (low carbohydrates, more proteins) for pancreatitis.If it wont help, you may also have partial bowels obstruction due to adhesions. To diagnose it, enteroclysis (abdominal CT with oral contrast) should be done.Cough can be caused by a connection between the abdominal and thoracic cavity or by metastases in the lungs.

In the past six months approximately when I was caring for my inlaws....they eat a very high protein and fibre diet....after a week with them I then developed IBS symtoms and was not able to go to the toilet for days. And my stomach had a dull ache all the time and was beginning to get phantom pains where my gall bladder was. This is the scary part: my rib cage is curled upwards from the swelling in my stomach that will not go down for the past week. I try and watch my acid intake as my gp said I will have to watch my ph balance in my stomach. Which he is right...the more acidic foods I eat the worse the swelling gets. I have had the cameras up and down and the only thing they could find is that I have the beginning stages of getting ulcers in my stomach and to follow a FODMAP diet (which doesn t work). I take atenenol 25mg daily for high blood pressure and mitral valve prolapse, I was taking nexium but it stopped working and I find more comfort in a digestive tea that has calendula in it. I am constantly nauseated and cannot eat properly without severe bloating, gas, cramps, headaches, vomiting sometimes (nothing of black or dark discoloration in my vomit) same with when I go to the toilet as well.

At this  time the pain was not up around my ribs. I went to the ER ,they did a  CT scan and found that I have gallstones. sense then I have started having pain around the ribs and while lying down can almost pin point the area exactly. But I am also swollen lower in my abdomen lower where  I am having spasms. I have a appt. with a Surgeon on Thursday for possible GB surgeryl.I am worried that my GB is not the problem  with the spasms. Do you think all stems from gallstones? Or could I I have two different problems,                                                                                                                                                  thank you","Doctor":"Hi, I went through your query. Gall bladder stones often cause pain along lower border of right ribs or at the right shoulder or back. Stones can also result in colicky pain and spasms s in your case. If the stone occludes the neck of gall bladder it can get swollen and you may feel a lump. But a lump could be there for other serious causes too. But since your CT indicates no other problem it seems gall bladder stones are responsible for your symptoms. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Dr. Gopi, I recently had an EKG for surgery clearance that showed I had a heart attack.  The EKG was repeated four times to be sure.  Same result.  I was sent for a stress test that showed no blockage, no damage and OK'd for surgery.  Should I have an angioplasty to be sure????  I am terrified.  Could I have a heart attack that left no sign of damage and no blockage???","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to HCM. As per your description, your ECG suggests that you have already sustained a heart attack. But only ECG cannot be relied upon since your stress test is normal and you have had no symptoms. Stress test is normal but it has only 70% sensitivity that means it will catch only 70% of cases with blocks. Some people do have ECGs that suggest heart attack but end up having normal results. I recommended and you undergo a 2D echo which will show if there has been any damage caused to the heart by the attack. The damage if present should correspond to the area in which ECG suggests a heart attack. If the echo shows abnormalities, then you must undergo a coronary angiogram. If 2d echo is normal then you need not worry about the ECG findings. Also important here is to do a 2d echo from a reputed centre, because it is an observer dependent test and details may be missed if done at non experienced hands. I hope I have answered your query satisfactorily. Wishing you good health.regards."},{"Patient":"Hi am a 40 year old female who just had repeat blood work done almost a year to the date of my Gallbladder removal which was March of 2013. I never had any stones, just biliary colic. I know this because I had a CCK Hida scan showing my Gallbladder was functioning at 17% and CT scans/U/S showed no stones. I also had MRCP to see if there was any complications with my biliary ducts or system in general, exam was unremarkable.

Although Nexium can significantly reduce the acid production from the stomach, in your case, it appears the excess levels of gastrin from the pancreas is causing excessive gastric acid secretion which Nexium is unable to completely neutralize. Your doctors are looking for the cause for this excessive secretion of gastrin, but I do not know if they have found any gastrin secreting tumours that may be responsible. Octreotide can help reduce gastrin secretion. Please discuss with your doctors what their views are about using octreotide in your case.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"Myself Jeremiah , 23yrs old , Height 5 9 ..Weight 83kg ...

My mother suffered a heart attack on 01.02.11 at 23.00 hrs. She was given a blood thinning injection at around 02.00 hrs on 02.02.11. Her health started deteriorating from 03.30 hrs onwards. She suffered from ventricular tachycardia. Now she is on life support system in Mumbai, India. her condition is bad. heart rate is 100 and blood pressure is 129/51. Is there anything that can be done to revive her. please let me know urgently. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to HCM.Your mother sustained a heart attack and she was given blood thinning medication to break the clot which caused the heart attack. After an heart attack, the heart muscle gets damaged. This leads to irritability of heart muscle and hence it starts producing extra beats leading to ventricular tachycardia in some patients.  Also as the heart muscle gets damaged, the pumping function of heart also decreases leading to decreased blood supply to vital organs and fluid congestion in the lungs. This decreased pumping function along with ventricular tachycardia causes complications. Patients can go on the ventilator and need medication support for LOW BP. I assume your mother is suffering from above issues and hence is in life support.She should be on two blood thinning medications, diuretics (water pill),  cholesterol lowering medications (statins) , anticoagulants like heparin or clexane , drugs for ventricular tachycardia like lignocaine or amiodarone and other supportive medications. The ventilatory support must be continued till she starts breathing on herself and lung congestion gets better. The other life support medications also are continued to her body responds well. The prognosis is guarded since she is requiring life support. They may also suggest an angiography and angioplasty to evaluate and treat blockages in the heart. Wishing her good health.

A 2D echo cannot show blockages in the heart arteries. It can show if some walls of the heart chambers are weak following a heart attack. Depending on which wall is affected, the artery which is blocked can be estimated. But the severity of blockage cannot be estimated by a 2 D echo. A 2d echo can give you the pumping function of he heart, which normally is 55-60%. Only an angiography can quantify the blockage severity. So if she has underwent an angiography then it may mean there is 81% of block and 19% of artery is functioning. If she has not underwent angiography then this 19% can be the pumping function of the heart (by 2d echo) which is low. So if angiography is not done then you must go ahead with an angiography to evaluate severity of blockages in the heart. Further decision regarding angioplasty can be done on basis of results of angiography. If angiography is done already and the blockage is greater than 70% severity., then angioplasty must be done.

It can be pancreas indeed. Due to pancreas insufficiency, it does not secrete enzymes digesting fat. It can cause fatty, bad smelling stools, abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss. Such stools usually float. Your symptoms may be also caused by partial bowels obstruction due to Crohns disease. It ca also give similar symptoms. Abdominal pain is like cramps.Please visit your doctor as you do not seem to be improving. Abdominal ultrasound, blood work, pancreas tests, liver tests, urine analysis and abdominal X-ray should be done at first.

You have high BP hence your doctor has started you on medications. Your heart rate of 80 bpm at rest and 106 BPM on activities is normal. You have not mentioned any symptoms of chest pain or breathlessness or chest discomfort so the probabilities of angina are low. TAB ismo also has am additional effect on reducing BP. Since you have no symptoms you can stop taking ISMO. However since your doctor feels you have some caridax issue we must get you evaluated for the same. Please do a ECG and a stress test. Stress test requires you to walk on a treadmill while your ECG is continuously recorded. This will help estimate if you have blockages in your heart.

He never drank, smoked, was not diabetic and extremely fit. Two years prior to his death, a routine medical revealed raised liver enzymes (all were raised). They continued to elevate over the next six months. He was perfectly healthy externally, and asymptomatic at this time. In July 2006, an appointment with a gastro. lead us to believe that my husband was fine and that she did not need to see him again. Her assumption was that he may have passed a small stone, accounting for the elevated enzymes. He remained asymptomatic until July 26th 2008 when he became extremely unwell that night and was completely severely jaundiced the following morning. This was accompanied by extreme weight loss, fatigue, deterioration and eventually death on September 3rd 2008. I, his wife, was told that what happened to him in July 2008 was a Budd Chiari syndrome, and that the elevated liver enzymes two years previously had nothing to do with his eventual death.

Once he patient is involved in a vicious cycle of its complications or even complications due to any sort of hepatitis of any other cause, the outcome appears less helpful.

I've had this off and on in my adulthood (age 42) but the other morning I was bending over to pet my cat and when I stood up I passed out and blacked out for a few minutes. It was very scary. I'm pretty sure it is low blood pressure, but what can I do about it?","Doctor":"HelloWelcome to HCM. By your description it looks like you have orthostatic hypotension. It happens when you get up suddenly from a lying position which leads to fall in BP and leads to dizziness and fainting. You can measue your BP in lying position and then in sitting and standing position. If the higher reading (systolic BP) falls than more than 20 mmhg on sitting or standing then you have postural or orthostatic hypotension. You have not mentioned here other medical issues if you have any. Some patients who are on diuretics or water pills, some anti hypertensive medications have these side effects. See your doctor and ask him whether you are on any of these medications. This repsonse can happen due to dehydration also, so if you are a kidney patient or generally drink less water, you can develop orthostatic hypotension. Please increase your water intake to 2-2.5 lit daily (provided you are not a heart or kidney disease patient). Also precautionary measures should be taken like getting up slowly from lying position and sitting for a minute and then get up.. wait for a minute and then walk. This will help the body adapt to the posture. Sometimes pooling of blood in the legs also can cause these symptoms. You can also use leg stockings to increase the flow of the blood back from the legs into the heart which can also help in your condition. If despite these measures you still have these complaints which severely affect your lifestyle then you can take tab midodrine 2.5 mg up to three days times a day. Remember this medication should be taken only if above measures are not effective and not as a first line of treatment. Wishing you good health.

It is a very common skin rash that can crop up throughout life.Intertrigo is most commonly caused by loss of air circulation, moisture and it is further enhanced by yeast infections.if it is not a rash, then it can be due to inflammatory breast cancer, coagulation disorders provided no history of any local injury or trauma.Some time wearing ill fitted bras can cause the similar bruise under breast.Thus you need thorough breast examination and ultrasound breast to rule out any breast cancer.2. Your blood reports shows that Abnormal liver function.The results just indicate that you have liver damage but the cause could be many.Some common causes are Fatty liver, Hepatitis from any cause such as alcohol, virus, drugs.Thus without proper clinical history and examination, it is not easy to diagnose the exact cause.Further you can rule out any fatty liver of cirrhosis by ultrasound abdomen.You may need to check viral hepatitis by viral antigens for Hepatitis viruses commonly B and C virus.Hope this helps.Please write back for further queries.Wishing you good health."},{"Patient":"I have a 5 cm cyst on my liver.

Should i see my dr? Possible cause's?Thank you","Doctor":"Hello welcome to HCM. Your BP recordings are not high, rather on he lower side, so this cannot be due to hypertension. Your heart rate of 106 is slightly high. Since you have got cough with phelgm along with crackles and whistling sounds I suppose you have sustained a lower respiratory tract infection. You have not mentioned if there is any fever. The heart rate may be faster due to the infection. I suggest you take a short 5 day course of antibiotics tab augmentin 625 mg thrice daily along with a cough medication and multivitamins. Please do a chest x ray and a sputum culture (phelgm testing) if symptoms do not improve after 5 days of antibiotics.

Your case you said lympnodes are tender which is an indication that you are suffering from infection of the area draining those lyphnodes otherwise tenderness of lymphnodes almost dont occur due to blood pressure so you get yourself examined by an ENT doctor so that he may rule out the possibility of infection and one more thing when there is any pain in body the chances of increased blood pressure and heart rate are also increased."},{"Patient":"I saw my doctor FRIDAY after intense pain in my right side under my rib he has referred me for a scan of gallbladder which I am waiting to hear a date for the pain has got better but I m still uncomfortable when I sit or bend this I can cope with but Ive had this shaky feeling all over and pressure in my head since the pain first started which I m finding hard to deal with should I contact my dr again, what s causing it and is there anything I can do to releive it I ve already gone on a low fat diet and been exercising gently","Doctor":"Good day!

At night I tend to drink less water because I can't sleep if I have to go to the toilet every 15 minutes. When I drink less I still have the urge to pee, but the amount of pee is a lot smaller, and a bit more yellow. I can hold my pee for maximum 1 hour. When I fall a sleep I wake up every hour with a huge urge to pee, One time I was to late. At night it hurts a bit at the end while peeing, during day it doesn't hurt because of all the water.My guess on this is that it's a urinary tract infection, only my pee is a lot more clear than the normal symptoms of the infection.2 Days earlier I suffered from gastro-enteritis, and I still have some effects of it like diarrhea and cramps. Because of that I don't eat much during day, which could explain why the pee is so clear.Do you have any idea what I could do to fasten up the healing process, I have Zinnit at home and I already took 3 of them, and the effects are slightly less now.

Nice to see a real good history , gone through and your English is perfectly normal. This is called frequency of micturition.

Vit D deficiency can cause generalised fatigue, shortness of breath etc. VitD deficiency could be causing your symptoms.

You will feel better with the same.None of your BP readings are worrisome and they must not cause you any symptoms. Among the above readings only the reading of 142/83 is slightly on the higher side and hence an acceptable reading. However your heart rate is on the higher range. This can cause early tiredness and fatigue also. You can take tablet ivabradine 5 mg twice a day to keep the heart rate under control.

Any suggestions as the where to look next.","Doctor":"Hello welcome to HCM. Since you have got yourself evaluated by an angiography and your doctor has cleared you from the heart side, means that the stent is working well. Angina can be caused by microvasuclar ischemia, which means the smallest vessels of the heart arteries are having blocks. These blocks cannot be seen by angiography nor can be stented. The treatment for micro vascular ischemia is antianginals, statins and anti platelets. You need not worry because it won't cause you any health issues. Other causes if chest pain here should be excluded. Like hyperacidity can mimic chest pain of cardiac origin. Please take a course of antacids for 14 days and see if your pain abates. Another cause can be costochondritis which is inflammation of the rib cartilage. This cinflammation can be contained by using anti inflammatory medications like diclofenac and ibuprofen. Next VitD levels should be checked. Bit D deficiency can also cause rib pain, bone pain fatigue. Please check your Vit D levels and take correction for vit D of they are low. You have a low probability of this pain originating from cardiac causes. So please continue taking tour cardiac medications and along with it take antacids, diclofenac and Vit D correction as adviced. Wishing you good health.

There are plenty of possible causes and most of them are benign and usually subside spontaneously. usually this is caused by sinus or any respiraoty infections. Some drugs can cause it as well.

It can be caused by gallbaldder or live rissue and this is most common cause of such pain. dilated intrahepatic ducts are seen most commonly in biliary tree obstructtion due to stones but also any kind of liver fibrosis or hepatitis can cause it as well. rarely tumors are diagnosed after such mri findings.

It just happens anytime of the day.  at times a become dizzy and when i sit down my heart does it again.","Doctor":"Hello welcome to HCM. If the heart stops your brain will not get blood supply and you will have serious complications. In your case you feel dizzy and and tingling sensation in the head and hands. So in your case the heart didn't stop but it skips a beat I suppose. We must get you evaluated for the same. I recommend you and ECG at first. If the ECG is normal, then you should undergo a 24 HR Holter monitoring, in which a small machine is attached to your waist with leads on your chest and you are sent home. The machine records your ECG throughout the day while you do your normal activities. You are also provided a log where you can jot down what activities you were doing with the time and also you can mention the time when you feel these symptoms. After 24 hrs when the machine is removed, the recordingsare evaluated to see the presence of heart rhythm disturbances. Your symptoms can also be correlated with the ECG of the time of your symptoms. This will give you the definitive answer of whether you have a skipped beat . Your description of heart stop here is unlikely. Please do the Holter monitoring test and revert back with the results.

It depends what kind of spots are these. it sounds to me more like some benign cystic disorder then some serious maligannt disease but further tests are necessary- Your symptoms are in most cases caused by IBD but hiatal hernia can be reason for it as well.

After an angioplasty, the patient must be on blood thinners or it will cause blockage of the stent. The first 6 more nths to one year after an angioplasty are most important. During this period patient should be on two blood thinners to prevent blockage of the stent.After one year, patient can be put on one blood thinner only. However stopping of blood thinner is strongly not adviced. In your case they have stopped since he had a minor bleed in the brain. But they must be started as soon as possible. Remember, the bleed happened probably due to high blood pressure or some artery malformation. So once the bleed has settled, blood pressure should be kept under strict control and one blood thinner can be started. Wishing you good health.

He was prescribed lamivudine tenofovir disoproxil fumarate which he had to take for one month. His medication is ending today. We have consulted doctors on whether or not he should continue with the drug but they give different opinion saying it should be stop after this month. I have read various recent research studies about the treatment that have lasted up to a year. So we are afraid that stopping the treatment may flare up the Hepatitis B virus. What should we do? Secondly, I tested for the same condition but I came out negative. My question is should I get vaccinated or I have developed antibodies so I do not vaccination. Thanks, waiting for your reply.","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HCM, For you, answer is simple. You must get vaccination immediately , if you have not been vaccinated before. For your husband, from your question, it is not clear that on which criteria, he has been started those medications. I am sure, he nust have undergone complete Hepatitis b serology including Hepatitis Core IgG, Hep Anti E, ALT, USG for liver or liver biopsy ,Viral DNA load, HIV test, before he started on above medication.  Duration of oral Antviral drugs is usually inconsistent, and depends on the response . But usually it could be anywhere from 1 yr to 5 years, with regular monitoring of Viral Load, Seroconversion, etc. Your concern is valid, to just stop after 1 month without any positive outcome is not understandable. There are high chances of developing resisitance to lamivudine.You talk to the Doctor who started the above medication and try to understand his clinical approach, and discuss your concern. You may send us all lab results and any further information, if you need further assistance. Meanwhile you continue giving him medicines.

I have asthma. but i feel not normal, because when i breath, my chest in pain. a lot of pain..my back also in pain when my heart beat very fast. i feel the pain on my left side.","Doctor":"Hello. welcome to HCM. Chest pain, breathlessness and fast heart rate while walking or during any exertion can be due to angina. When you walk or exert, the heart's oxygen demand increases and hence the blood flow to the heart also increases. If the arteries are having blockages, then this supply is hampered leading to chest pain, breathlessness. The heart tries to compensate by beating faster hence the fast heart rate. Breathlessness in your case can also be continued by asthma. I recommend you do an ECG and a 2 d echo for cardiac evaluation. If both ECG and 2d echo are normal then you must undergo a stress test. It tests the functional capacity of the heart and can predict presence of blockages in the heart. Also I hope you are compliant on your asthma medications and inhalers. I suggest you do a PFT (pulmonary function test) also to evaluate the functional capacity of the lungs.All these together will give a definite reason for your symptoms.

It is true that this disease attack mainly adolescents and young adult but it may occur from childhood to old age.

After an infection, the virus remains dormant in certain cells of the throat and can be excreted in saliva of a healthy person. Your husband might have had the infection when he was young.

And in a few months SGPT was 27 and recently it was 16 with rest of the LFT normal. What could be the reason for this elevated SGPT?","Doctor":"Thanks for query.elevated ALT(sgpt) may be due to different reasons as you mention it was high and gradually decreased probable cause could be alcohol abuse if you had a binge or Drugs (ie, statins, aspirin, barbiturates, HIV medication, herbs etc if you had them any.you needed not worry much about their levels unless they are persistently elevated .regards"},{"Patient":"I have recently been diagnosed with lupus (systemic not discoid), and there seems to have been organ involvement - namely my liver. A recent ultrasound showed severe hematology of 184 mm with fatty infiltration. My blood tests showed an elevated AST of 55 (normal 30) and an ALT of 72 (normal 39). This is not alcohol related since I rarely drink (I have had 3 drinks so far this year). I eat very well and up until I became sick last year, rode 100 miles per week on my bike. I m waiting for a referral to an Gastroenterologist but that will take a few weeks, if not months. What do you think next steps would be? Liver biopsy? And since this doesn t seem to be diet related, what can I do to get healthier? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello! Thanks for putting your query in HCM. I am a Gastroenterologist (DM).It may be due to lupus itself an autoimmune disease or may be due to some other cause like: 1. If you are obese or overweight you need to reduce your weight2.Other common and treatable causes like Hepatitis B and C virus, Serum ceruloplasmin for wilson disease especially if you are young, ANA and SMA for autoimmune disease3. Lipid profile for NAFLDI will advise you to visit a Gastroenterologist who will advise you for above tests. If they all are negative then he may advise for liver biopsy to see for autoimmune hepatitis.Meanwhile I will advise you to take tablet ursodeoxycholic acid and vitamin E and do regular exercise which I found very useful in my patients with fatty liverI hope I have answered your query and this will help you. If you have any further query  I will be happy to answer that too.

Some laboratories consider up to 56 as a normal value. A value of 44 should not be a cause for alarm. Many conditions can increase blood levels of this enzyme. These include liver problems, heart  problems, muscle trauma, drugs and many other conditions.

I am Dr Thakker and shall be answering your question.I can understand your anxiety about the abnormal liver function tests. I shall try my best to answer your question and guide you through it.In your case the SGPT is 130 and SGOT is 46. Thus SGPT/SGOT ratio is more than 2. This is suggestive of alcoholic liver disease. Your ultrasound suggests that you have a fatty liver.Both of these are because of the alcohol intake. I would like to know more details of your drinking habits, with regards to frequency, amount and the nature of alcohol consumed. I would advice to abstain from alcohol. Since this is early alcoholic disease these findings will reverse on stopping alcohol. I would also advice you to take a low fat diet.In case you do not heed to the advice, you may land up with cirrhosis of liver which is irreversible. Liver transplant is then the only way out for you.I hope this helps you out. If you have any more questions, please do not hesitate to write back to me.Yours sincerely,Dr Thakker."},{"Patient":"I recently had a nuclear stress test (age 61, had light headed feelings one evening), all turned out normal except have RBBB as detected on treadmill part of the test while exercising.

A nuclear stress test is very sensitive in detecting blockages in the heart. Changes in the ECG during a treadmill test are considered significant. nuclear stress test also checks the contractility of the heart during the change of rhythm to RBBB. Since you have said that it was reported normalz I suppose you had a rate dependent RBBB. So there is nothing to worry about this. If you and a plain stress test I would have suggested you to see a cardiologist. But since this was a nuclear stress test which wqa normal, you need not see a cardiologist now.
