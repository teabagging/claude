Determine all pairs (x, y) of real numbers that satisfy the inequality(x+y)left(frac{1}{x}+frac{1}{y}right) geqqleft(frac{x}{y}+frac{y}{x}right)^{2} .","solution":"SOLUTION. Neither x nor y can be zero, as they are in the denominators of the fractions in the given inequality. The problem does not specify the sign of the numbers x and y, so we must not forget that these numbers can also be negative when performing transformations.We will first try to simplify the expressions in the problem. By multiplying the inequality by the positive number x^{2} y^{2}, we can equivalently eliminate the denominators:begin{aligned}& (x+y) frac{x+y}{x y} geqqleft(frac{x^{2}+y^{2}}{x y}right)^{2}, quad mid cdot x^{2} y^{2} & x y(x+y)^{2} geqqleft(x^{2}+y^{2}right)^{2} .end{aligned}Now it is clear that by expanding the expressions in the obtained inequality, we will get the term 2 x^{2} y^{2} on both sides - we can cancel this term in the first step and further transform the inequality into a product form:begin{aligned}x^{3} y+2 x^{2} y^{2}+x y^{3} & geqq x^{4}+2 x^{2} y^{2}+y^{4}, x^{3} y+x y^{3} & geqq x^{4}+y^{4}, 0 & geqq x^{4}-x^{3} y+y^{4}-x y^{3}, 0 & geqq x^{3}(x-y)-y^{3}(x-y), 0 & geqqleft(x^{3}-y^{3}right)(x-y) .end{aligned}On the right side of the last inequality, we have the product of two binomials, and since we are comparing it to zero, it is sufficient to examine the signs of the individual parentheses.If x geqq y, then x^{3} geqq y^{3}, and similarly, if x leqq y, then x^{3} leqq y^{3} (this is a consequence of the fact that the function of the third power is increasing over the entire domain of real numbers). Therefore, the expressions in the parentheses have the same sign for any values of x and y, so the inequality left(x^{3}-y^{3}right)(x-y) geqq 0 holds. Inequality (1) can only be satisfied if one of the parentheses is zero. The equations x=y and x^{3}=y^{3} are equivalent, so inequality (1) holds if and only if x=y.The solution consists of all pairs of real numbers (x, y) where x=y neq 0. In the transformations, we used only equivalent transformations, so a verification of correctness is not necessary.Note. The product on the right side of (1) can also be transformed using the formula x^{3}-y^{3}=(x-y)left(x^{2}+x y+y^{2}right) into the product of two non-negative polynomials:left(x^{3}-y^{3}right)(x-y)=(x-y)^{2}left(x^{2}+x y+y^{2}right) .The trinomial in the second parenthesis has a non-positive discriminant D(y)=y^{2}-4 y^{2}=-3 y^{2} leqq 0 for any y. Therefore, the equality x^{2}+x y+y^{2}=0 occurs only in the case x=y=0.## GUIDING AND SUPPLEMENTARY PROBLEMS:N1.

It's a complex problem that covers multiple topics.Since E and F are the midpoints of AB and AC, the distance from EF to BC is half the distance from point A to BC. Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is twice the area of triangle PBC. Given that the area of triangle ABC is 4, the area of triangle PBC is 2.The area of triangle PBC can also be calculated as dfrac{1}{2}PB times PC sin angle{BPC}, so PB times PC = dfrac{2}{sin angle{BPC}}.Thus, overrightarrow{PC} cdot overrightarrow{PB} = PB times PC cos angle{BPC} = dfrac{2cos angle{BPC}}{sin angle{BPC}}.According to the cosine theorem, BC^{2}=BP^{2}+CP^{2}-2BP times CPcos angle{BPC}. Clearly, BP and CP are both positive numbers, so BP^{2}+CP^{2} geq 2BP times CP, and hence BC^{2} geq 2BP times CP - 2BP times CP cos angle{BPC}.Therefore, overrightarrow{PC} cdot overrightarrow{PB} + {overrightarrow{BC}}^{2} geq PB times PC cos angle{BPC} + 2BP times CP - 2BP times CP cos angle{BPC} = dfrac{4 - 2cos angle{BPC}}{sin angle{BPC}}.Let y = dfrac{4 - 2cos angle{BPC}}{sin angle{BPC}}, then y' = dfrac{2 - 4cos angle{BPC}}{sin^{2} angle{BPC}}.Letting y' = 0 gives cos angle{BPC} = dfrac{1}{2}. The function is monotonically increasing on (0, dfrac{1}{2}) and monotonically decreasing on (dfrac{1}{2}, 1).So when cos angle{BPC} = dfrac{1}{2}, dfrac{4 - 2cos angle{BPC}}{sin angle{BPC}} reaches its maximum value of 4sqrt{3}.Hence, the minimum value of overrightarrow{PC} cdot overrightarrow{PB} + {overrightarrow{BC}}^{2} is boxed{4sqrt{3}}."},{"problem":"## Problem StatementCalculate the volumes of solids formed by rotating the figures bounded by the graphs of the functions.

Find the maximal number of elements in the set of 10-digit integers with no two integers being neighbours.","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the maximal number of 10-digit integers such that no two integers in the set are neighbours. Two 10-digit integers are neighbours if they differ in exactly one digit.2. Counting 9-digit Integers:   Consider the set of all 9-digit integers. There are (9 cdot 10^8) such integers. This is because a 9-digit integer can be any number from (100,000,000) to (999,999,999), which gives us (9 cdot 10^8) possibilities.3. Generating 10-digit Integers:   For each 9-digit integer, we can generate 10 different 10-digit integers by appending a digit from 0 to 9 at the end. This means for each 9-digit integer, there is a set of 10 possible 10-digit integers.4. Pigeonhole Principle:   If we select more than (9 cdot 10^8) 10-digit integers, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two of them will belong to the same set of 10 integers generated from a single 9-digit integer. These two integers will differ only in the last digit, making them neighbours.5. Constructing a Non-neighbouring Set:   To construct a set of (9 cdot 10^8) 10-digit integers with no two being neighbours, we can use the following method:   - For each 9-digit integer, append a last digit such that the sum of all digits (including the appended digit) is congruent to a fixed residue modulo 10. For simplicity, we can choose the residue to be 0.   - This means for a 9-digit integer (a_1a_2 ldots a_9), we append the digit (d) such that ((a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_9 + d) equiv 0 pmod{10}).6. Verification:   - By this construction, no two 10-digit integers in the set will differ in exactly one digit. If they did, they would have to differ in the last digit, but since the last digit is determined by the sum of the first 9 digits modulo 10, this is not possible.Conclusion:The maximal number of 10-digit integers with no two being neighbours is (9 cdot 10^8).The final answer is (boxed{9 cdot 10^8})."},{"problem":"4.3.

We start with the given equation acos B - bcos A = c. This equation can be transformed using the sine rule in a triangle, which states that frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C}. By applying trigonometric identities, we can rewrite the given equation as:   [   frac{a}{sin A}sin Acos B - frac{b}{sin B}sin Bcos A = c   ]   Simplifying this, we get:   [   sin Acos B - sin Bcos A = sin C   ]   This is because c = sin C when applying the sine rule.2.

From the equation 2sin Bcos A = 0, we deduce that either sin B = 0 or cos A = 0. However, in a triangle, no angle can be 0 or pi, which means sin B neq 0. Therefore, we conclude that:   [   cos A = 0   ]   This implies that A = frac{pi}{2}, as cos A = 0 only when A is frac{pi}{2}.5. Finally, knowing that the sum of angles in a triangle equals pi, we can find B:   [   B = pi - A - C = pi - frac{pi}{2} - frac{pi}{5} = frac{3pi}{10}   ]   Therefore, the angle B is frac{3pi}{10}.Hence, the correct answer is boxed{C}."},{"problem":"Given that i is the imaginary unit, if the complex number (1+ai)(2-i) is a purely imaginary number (ain R), then the conjugate of the complex number a+i is ______.","solution":"Since (1+ai)(2-i)=(a+2)+(2a-1)i is a purely imaginary number,we have the following system of equations:begin{cases} a+2=0  2a-1neq 0end{cases}Solving for a, we get a=-2.Thus, a+i=-2+i, and its conjugate is -2-i.Therefore, the answer is boxed{-2-i}."},{"problem":"7.

Continue this process. How many red points can be obtained at most on the circumference? Prove your conclusion.","solution":"Proof Consider a circle with 2n points in general.(1) On a circle with 2n points, if the first red point is an even-numbered point, for example, the 2k-th point, then according to the coloring rule, each red point dyed afterward will also be an even-numbered point. At this time, if the points numbered 2, 4, 6, cdots, 2k, cdots, 2n are renumbered as 1^{*}, 2^{*}, 3^{*}, cdots, k^{*}, cdots, n^{*}, it is easy to see that the number of red points that can be dyed starting from the 2k-th point on a circle with 2n points is the same as the number of red points that can be dyed starting from the k-th point on a circle with n points, and they form a one-to-one correspondence.(2) On a circle with 2n points, if the first red point is an odd-numbered point, then the second red point must be an even-numbered point. By (1), in this case, it can also correspond to a coloring method starting from the k-th point on a circle with n points, and the number of red points dyed is exactly one more than the number of red points obtained by this coloring method on the circle with n points.(3) Let the maximum number of red points that can be dyed on a circle with n points be f(n), and suppose the coloring method starting from the k-th point achieves this maximum value. Then, on a circle with 2n points, the coloring method starting from the k-th point should achieve the maximum value f(n)+1 (since the second red point is the 2k-th point). Therefore, f(2n)=f(n)+1.(4) From (3), we havebegin{array}{l}f(800)=f(400)+1=f(200)+2 =f(100)+3=f(50)+4=f(25)+5 .end{array}(5) To calculate f(25), note that on a circle with 25 points, if the number of the first red point is a multiple of 5, then the number of each red point dyed afterward will also be a multiple of 5. Therefore, the number of red points that can be dyed starting from such a point will not exceed 5.If the number of the first red point is not a multiple of 5, then the number of each red point dyed afterward will also not be a multiple of 5. Therefore, starting from such a point, at most 20 red points can be dyed.On the other hand, starting from a certain such point, we can actually dye 20 red points, for example, starting from the 1st point, we can sequentially dye 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 7, 14, 3, 6, 12, 24, 23, 21, 17, 9, 18, 11, 22, 19, 13.

We conjecture that the last two digits of the powers of 9 form a period of 10. Since the last two digits of a power of 9 can be obtained by multiplying the last two digits of the previous power by 9 and taking the last two digits of the result, if two powers of 9 have the same last two digits, then the next ones will also have the same last two digits. Thus, the last two digits of the 12th and 2nd powers are the same, ... the last two digits of the 10th and 20th powers are the same, and so the 20th power also ends in 01. Therefore, the last two digits of the powers of 9 indeed form a period of 10. According to this, to find the last two digits of 9^{h}, it is sufficient to know the last digit of h=8^{varrho}, i.e., the remainder when h is divided by 10.

Thus, to determine the last digit of 8^{g}, it is sufficient to know the remainder when g=7^{f} is divided by 4. Since f=6^{e} and e=0, f will be an even number: f=2 f^{prime}. Thus, g=7^{2 f^{prime}}=49 f^{prime}, and hence g-1=49^{f^{prime}}-1=49^{f^{prime}}-1^{f^{prime}} is divisible by (49-1)=48, and thus also by 4, so g gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 4. From (2), we see that the last digit of 8^{g} is the same as the last digit of 8^{1}. Thus, this digit is 8, so the last digit of h=8^{g} is 8. According to (1), in this case the last two digits of 9^{h} are the same as the last two digits of 9^{8}, which are 21.Therefore, the last two digits of 9^{h} are 21.Imre Nagy (Szombathely, Lajos Nagy Gymnasium, 2nd grade)Remark.

Suppose, indeed, that a_{1} and a_{2} are coprime. Then a_{1} and 2 a_{1}-a_{2} are also coprime. Therefore, a_{3} can only be an integer if frac{a_{2}}{2 a_{1}-a_{2}} is an integer. If frac{a_{2}}{2 a_{1}-a_{2}} is an integer, then frac{a_{2}}{2 a_{1}-a_{2}}+1=frac{2 a_{1}}{2 a_{1}-a_{2}} is also an integer. But this can only be if frac{2}{2 a_{1}-a_{2}} is also an integer, because a_{1} and 2 a_{1}-a_{2} are coprime by our assumption. This last quotient, considering inequality (5), can only be an integer if 2 a_{1}-a_{2}=2. In this case, 3 a_{1}-2 a_{2}=1, from which a_{1}=3, a_{2}=4, a_{3}=6 and a_{4}=12. This number quadruple forms only a five-digit number. Therefore, the number quadruple that satisfies the problem's requirements can only be found when d=2. In this case, due to inequality (8),6 leq a_{1}<a_{2}<10and because d=2, a_{1} and a_{2} are both even. Therefore, a_{1} can only be 6, and in this case a_{2}=8.

Prove that a=b.[i]Proposed by Mohsen Jamali, Iran[/i]","solution":"1. Assume for contradiction: Suppose ( a neq b ). Then, ( b - a ) has finitely many prime divisors.2. Lemma I: There exists an odd prime ( p > b > a ) such that ( 4 nmid a^p + p ) and ( gcd(a^p + p, b - a) leq 2 ).   Proof of Lemma I:   - Let ( p ) be an odd prime. If ( a ) is even and ( p ) is odd, then ( 4 nmid a^p + p ).   - If ( a equiv pm 1 pmod{4} ), choose ( p equiv a pmod{4} ). Thus, there exists an odd prime ( p ) for which ( 4 nmid a^p + p ).   - Now, we prove the second part of Lemma I. Let ( q ) be an odd prime divisor of ( b - a ). For all ( q ), if ( a equiv 1 pmod{q} ), let ( p equiv 1 pmod{q} ), then ( a^p + p equiv 2 pmod{q} ).   - Otherwise, if ( a notequiv 1 pmod{q} ), let ( p equiv -1 pmod{q} ), so ( a^p + p equiv a^p - 1 pmod{q} ).   - Assume for contradiction that ( q mid a^p - 1 ). Then, either ( text{ord}_q(a) = 1 ) or ( text{ord}_q(a) = p ). In the former case, this means ( a equiv 1 pmod{q} ), contradiction. In the latter case, this gives us ( q equiv 1 pmod{p} ), contradiction, since ( p > q ), as ( p equiv -1 pmod{q} ).   - Hence, by Dirichlet's Theorem of Arithmetic Progression together with the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we find that there exists an odd prime ( p > b > a ) such that ( gcd(a^p + p, b - a) ) has no prime factors other than possibly ( 2 ), and since we can choose ( p ) such that ( 4 nmid a^p + p ), it follows that ( gcd(a^p + p, b - a) leq 2 ), as desired. (blacksquare)3. Using Lemma I: Let ( n = p ), where ( p ) is an odd prime which satisfies the conditions in Lemma I, so we have ( a^p + p mid b^p - a^p ).4. Prime divisor analysis: Let ( q ) be a prime divisor of ( a^p + p ). If ( q mid b ), then ( q mid a ), so ( q mid p ), which means that ( q = p ). However, ( p > a ), therefore we must have ( q nmid a, b ).5. Order analysis: Then, ( q mid (ba^{-1})^p - 1 ), so ( text{ord}_q(ba^{-1}) = 1 ) or ( text{ord}_q(ba^{-1}) = p ). In the former case, we obtain ( q mid b - a ), however, since ( gcd(a^p + p, b - a) leq 2 ), this implies ( q = 2 ). In the latter case, this implies ( q equiv 1 pmod{p} ), so for all primes ( q mid a^p + p ), either ( q = 2 ) or ( q equiv 1 pmod{p} ), and also ( 4 nmid a^p + p ), hence we must have either ( a^p + p equiv 1 pmod{p} ) or ( a^p + p equiv 2 pmod{p} ), or, equivalently, ( a equiv 1 pmod{p} ) or ( a equiv 2 pmod{p} ). Since ( p > b > a ), this is only possible if ( a = 1 ) or ( a = 2 ).6. Case analysis:   - If ( a = 1 ), then if any prime ( q mid b ), setting ( n = q - 1 ), we obtain ( q mid b^{q - 1} + q - 1 equiv -1 pmod{q} ), contradiction. Hence, ( b ) cannot have any prime divisors, so ( b = 1 ).   - If ( a = 2 ), then ( a^p + p ) is odd, so ( gcd(a^p + p, b - a) = gcd(2^p + p, b - 2) = 1 ). Then, we have ( a^p + p = 2^p + p mid b^p - a^p = b^p - 2^p ). Let ( q ) be a prime divisor of ( 2^p + p ). Note that ( q ) must be odd. If ( q mid b ), then ( q mid 2 ), so ( q = 2 ), contradiction. As a result, ( q nmid b ), then ( q mid (b cdot 2^{-1})^p - 1 ), therefore ( text{ord}_q(b cdot 2^{-1}) = 1 ) or ( text{ord}_q(b cdot 2^{-1}) = p ). In the former case, this gives us ( q mid b - 2 ), but this is impossible since ( gcd(2^p + p, b - 2) = 1 ). In the latter case, this implies ( q equiv 1 pmod{p} ), so for all primes ( q mid 2^p + p ), ( q equiv 1 pmod{p} ), so this gives us ( 2^p + p equiv 1 pmod{p} ), but we also have ( 2^p + p equiv 2 pmod{p} ), contradiction.7.

Verify that no other factor pairs yield a higher value:   - Since ( r ) must be minimized and any other prime ( r ) would be odd, making ( 2016 + r^2 ) odd, the factors of ( 2016 + r^2 ) would also be odd.

Subtracting the two equations, we have a_{n-1} a_{n+2} a_{n+3}(a_{n}-a_{n+1})=a_{n}-a_{n+1}. Therefore, (a_{n}-a_{n+4})(a_{n+1} a_{n+2} a_{n+3}-1)=0.

By using the coordination of the two equations (adding or subtracting), some terms are eliminated, leading to a relationship between two terms in the sequence, revealing its periodicity and facilitating the solution. The conclusion of this problem can be generalized to a more general case:Theorem: If the sequence {a_{n}} satisfies prod_{i=0}^{m} a_{n+i}=P sum_{i=0}^{m} a_{n+i} (P neq 0, prod_{i=1}^{m} a_{n+1} neq P, m in mathbf{N}^{+}), then m+1 is one of its periods.Proof: Frombegin{array}{l}prod_{i=0}^{m} a_{n+i}=P sum_{i=0}^{m} a_{n+i}, prod_{i=1}^{m+1} a_{n+i}=P sum_{i=1}^{m-1} a_{n+i}.end{array}Subtracting (2) from (1), we getleft(a_{n-m+1}-a_{n}right) prod_{i=1}^{m} a_{n+i}=P a_{n, m+1}-P a_{n},Thus,left(a_{n+m+1}-a_{n}right)left(prod_{i=1}^{m} a_{n+1}-Pright)=0.Sinceprod_{i=1}^{m} a_{n+i}-P neq 0, text{ it follows that } a_{n+m+1}=a_{n}.Therefore, m+1 is a period of the sequence.Note: m+1 is a period of the sequence, but it is not necessarily the smallest positive period. For example, if the first m+1 terms of the sequence in the theorem itself have periodicity, the smallest positive period of the sequence is not m+1.In high school, the general method for solving periodic sequence problems is to list the first few terms to observe their periodicity and then use the periodicity to solve the problem. Clearly, the method of listing the first few terms can only solve problems with a small smallest positive period. For sequences with a large smallest positive period, this method is not practical, and deriving that a sequence is periodic based on the first few terms lacks scientific proof.

When m=2, n=5. In fact, in the two-colored K_{4} (solid lines represent blue, dashed lines represent red) shown in the figure, any two segments of the same color have a common endpoint. However, in a one-colored K_{5}, if all segments are the same color, there are certainly two segments of the same color without a common point; otherwise, there must be one red and one blue segment with one common endpoint, say A_{1} A_{2} is red, and A_{2} A_{3} is blue. It is evident that, regardless of the color of A_{4} A_{5}, there are always two segments of the same color without a common endpoint. This proves that when m=2, the smallest positive integer n=5.Next, we use induction to prove that for all natural numbers m, n=3 m-1.We have already proven the proposition for m=1,2. Assume the proposition holds for m=k. When m=k+1, if all edges of K_{3 k+2} are the same color, it is certainly possible to find k+1 segments that meet the requirement. Otherwise, there must be one vertex that is the common endpoint of one red edge and one blue edge. Removing these three endpoints, there are still 3 k-1 vertices left. By the induction hypothesis, in the complete subgraph K_{3 k-1} with these 3 k-1 vertices, there exist k segments of the same color, none of which have a common endpoint. Adding one more segment of the same color from the previous two, we get k+1 segments, all of the same color and none of which have a common endpoint.On the other hand, divide the vertices of K_{3 k+1} into two groups: Group A has k vertices, and Group B has 2 k+1 vertices. Color all the segments between the vertices in Group B red, and all other segments blue.

Similarly, the perpendicular distance k from E to AB is BC sin b sin( g + a )/sin( a + b ).

Since each number in the sequence, starting from the second, is at least one greater than the previous one, the 9 cdot 1000^{1000}-th number in the sequence is greater than 9 cdot 1000^{1000}, meaning it has at least 3001 digits. Let's denote the n-th number in the sequence by a_{n}, and let k be the smallest index such that the number a_{k} has 3002 digits. If we prove that k > 9 cdot 1000^{1000}, then we will have that the 9 cdot 1000^{1000}-th number in the sequence has no more than 3001 digits, meaning it has exactly 3001 digits.Consider the numbers from 0 to 10^{3001}-1 that do not contain the digit 1 in their decimal representation. By padding each of these numbers with leading zeros to 3001 digits, we obtain all sequences of length 3001 consisting of digits other than 1. There are 9^{3001} such sequences. Therefore, among the numbers a_{1}, ldots, a_{k-1}, there are no more than 9^{3001} numbers that do not contain the digit 1 (since all of them are less than or equal to 10^{3001}-1).Now consider the process of obtaining the number a_{k} from a_{1}. On each of the k-1 steps, a number from 1 to 9 is added, and the number of steps on which a number other than 1 is added does not exceed 9^{3001}.

The last equation has only one natural root: x=1.Since the original equation is symmetric with respect to x and y, substituting x=1 into it, we get that y = 1.Fourth method. Since the original equation is symmetric with respect to x and y, it is sufficient to consider the case x geq y.Write the equation as left(x^{3}-3xyright)+left(y^{3}+1right)=0. Since y is a natural number, y^{3}+1>0. Therefore, x^{3}-3xy=xleft(x^{2}-3yright)<0. Thus,x^{2}-3y<0 ( x is natural). Considering that x geq y, i.e., -3x leq -3y, we get: x^{2}-3x<0.

Palmer builds his dice correctly, placing the dots so that 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 dots are on separate faces. In a fit of mischief, James places his 21 dots on a die in a peculiar order, putting some nonnegative integer number of dots on each face, but not necessarily in the correct con\\ffiguration. Regardless of the confi\\fguration of dots, both dice are unweighted and have equal probability of showing each face after being rolled.Then Palmer and James play a game. Palmer rolls one of his normal dice and James rolls his peculiar die. If they tie, they roll again. Otherwise the person with the larger roll is the winner. What is the maximum probability that James wins? Give one example of a peculiar die that attains this maximum probability.","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   Palmer's die is a standard six-sided die with faces numbered 1 through 6. James's die has 21 dots distributed across its six faces, but not necessarily in the standard configuration. Both dice are fair, meaning each face has an equal probability of being rolled. The goal is to determine the maximum probability that James wins when both dice are rolled, and to provide an example of a configuration of James's die that achieves this maximum probability.2. Initial Considerations:   - James's die should not have more than 7 dots on any face, as rolling a 7 guarantees a win.   - Let ( s_1, s_2, ldots, s_6 ) be the number of dots on the faces of James's die.   - Let ( n ) be the number of faces with 0 dots.   - The total number of dots is ( s_1 + s_2 + cdots + s_6 = 21 ).3. Probability of Winning on the First Roll:   - If James rolls ( x ) dots, the probability that he wins on the first roll is ( frac{x-1}{6} ) for ( 1 le x le 6 ).   - If ( x = 0 ), the probability of winning is ( frac{0}{6} = 0 ).4. Calculating the Probability:   - The probability that James wins on the first roll is:     [     frac{1}{6} left( frac{n}{6} + sum_{i=1}^{6} frac{s_i - 1}{6} right) = frac{1}{6} left( frac{s_1 + s_2 + cdots + s_6 - 6 + n}{6} right) = frac{1}{6} left( frac{21 - 6 + n}{6} right) = frac{15 + n}{36}     ]5. Probability of a Tie:   - The probability of a tie after James rolls ( x ) is ( frac{1}{6} ) for ( 1 le x le 6 ) and 0 if ( x = 0 ) or ( x = 7 ).   - Let ( m ) be the number of faces with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 dots.   - The probability of a tie is ( frac{1}{6} cdot frac{m}{6} = frac{m}{36} ).6. Total Probability of Winning:   - The probability that James wins on the ( k )-th roll (( k > 1 )) is:     [     left( frac{m}{36} right)^{k-1} left( frac{15 + n}{36} right)     ]   - Summing over all possible rolls, the total probability of winning is:     [     sum_{i=0}^{infty} left( frac{m}{36} right)^i left( frac{15 + n}{36} right) = frac{frac{15 + n}{36}}{1 - frac{m}{36}} = frac{15 + n}{36 - m}     ]7. Maximizing the Probability:   - We have ( m + n le 6 ).   - To maximize ( frac{15 + n}{36 - m} ), we choose ( m ) and ( n ) such that ( m + n = 6 ).   - If ( n = 3 ), the faces must be ( 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7 ), which is not possible since ( 7 ) dots on a face is not allowed.   - Thus, ( n < 3 ), so the possible pairs ((m, n)) are ((6, 0)), ((5, 1)), and ((4, 2)).8. Calculating Probabilities for Each Pair:   - For ((m, n) = (6, 0)):     [     frac{15 + 0}{36 - 6} = frac{15}{30} = frac{1}{2}     ]   - For ((m, n) = (5, 1)):     [     frac{15 + 1}{36 - 5} = frac{16}{31}     ]   - For ((m, n) = (4, 2)):     [     frac{15 + 2}{36 - 4} = frac{17}{32}     ]9. Conclusion:   - The maximum probability is achieved with ((m, n) = (4, 2)), yielding a probability of (frac{17}{32}).   - An example configuration of James's die that achieves this is (0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 3).The final answer is ( boxed{ frac{17}{32} } )."},{"problem":"1.

To quickly rule out the other cases, we observe that N and N+1 are coprime.

Therefore the three factorsy^{2},(y-1) text { and }left(y^{2}-y-1right) text { are pairwise coprime. }Since their product is a perfect square it follows that either: one of y^{2},(y-1) and left(y^{2}-y-1right) is zero, or all three of them are perfect squares. So we have four cases:- Case A: y=0.Substituting this into the original equation yields (0)^{5}+2 x(0)=x^{2}+2(0)^{4}. Solving this quadratic yields x=1 and so (x, y)=(0,0) is the only solution in this case.- Case B: y=1.Substituting this into the original equation yields (1)^{5}+2 x(1)=x^{2}+2(1)^{4}.

Jovan and Goce were fishing with their sons. Jovan caught as many fish as his son, and Goce caught three times as many as his son. Together, they caught 25 fish. Jovan's son is named Risto. What is the name of Goce's son?","solution":"Solution. Let Jovan caught x fish. His son Risto caught the same number. If Goce's son caught y fish, then Goce caught 3y fish. Therefore, all together they caught 2x + 4y fish, so 2x + 4y = 25. The last equation is not possible, because the left side is divisible by 2, while the right side is not divisible by 2.Thus, there were two fathers and two sons at the fishing, but they were not four different people. This is only possible if one person is both a father and a son at the same time. Since Jovan and Risto are father and son who caught the same number of fish, and Goce caught three times more fish than his son, we conclude that only Jovan can be both a father and a son, i.e., Goce's son is Jovan. Indeed, in this case, we get the equation 3x + x + x = 25, i.e., x = 5, which means that Jovan and Risto caught 5 fish each, and Goce caught 15 fish."},{"problem":"151.

Draw a line through B perpendicular to CB, which thus forms a 30^{circ} angle with the other ray of the 120^{circ} angle. Place the distance-carrying straightedge (rotating around C and sliding - everyone can try this on a flat sheet of paper) so that it touches C, and at the same time, the two endpoints of a unit segment E and F lie on the rays of the 30^{circ} angle.

Initial Considerations: We need to find all positive integers ( n ) such that for all numbers ( a_1, a_2, dots, a_k ) less than ( n ) and relatively prime to ( n ), with ( a_1 < a_2 < dots < a_k ), none of the sums ( a_i + a_{i+1} ) for ( i = 1, 2, dots, k-1 ) are divisible by 3.2. Case ( n = 2 ): Clearly, ( n = 2 ) is a solution because the only number less than 2 and relatively prime to 2 is 1. There are no pairs ( (a_i, a_{i+1}) ) to consider, so the condition is trivially satisfied.3. Case ( n geq 3 ): For ( n geq 3 ), the number of integers less than ( n ) and relatively prime to ( n ) is given by Euler's totient function ( phi(n) ). For ( n geq 3 ), ( phi(n) ) is even.4. Odd ( n ): If ( n ) were odd, then ( a_2 = 2 ) (since 2 is relatively prime to any odd number). This would imply ( a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 2 = 3 ), which is divisible by 3. This is a contradiction. Hence, ( n ) must be even.5. Even ( n ): For any ( x ) coprime to ( n ), ( n - x ) is also coprime to ( n ). Therefore, both ( x ) and ( n - x ) are in the set ( {a_i} ). Since ( phi(n) ) is even, we can pair the elements such that ( a_i + a_{k+1-i} = n ). 6. Divisibility by 3: If ( n ) is divisible by 3, then ( n = 3m ) for some integer ( m ). This would imply that ( a_i + a_{i+1} ) could be ( 3m ), which is divisible by 3. Hence, ( n ) cannot be divisible by 3.7. Modulo 3 Analysis: We need ( n equiv 1 pmod{3} ) or ( n equiv 2 pmod{3} ). If ( n equiv 2 pmod{3} ), then ( a_k + a_{k-1} = (n-1) + (n-3) equiv 0 pmod{3} ), which is a contradiction. Therefore, ( n equiv 1 pmod{3} ).8. Checking Small Values: We check small values of ( n ) that satisfy ( n equiv 1 pmod{3} ) and are even:   - ( n = 4 ): The numbers less than 4 and relatively prime to 4 are 1 and 3. The sum ( 1 + 3 = 4 ) is not divisible by 3.   - ( n = 10 ): The numbers less than 10 and relatively prime to 10 are 1, 3, 7, and 9. The sums are ( 1 + 3 = 4 ), ( 3 + 7 = 10 ), and ( 7 + 9 = 16 ), none of which are divisible by 3.9.

For this, we can divide each row into 8 rectangles of 1 times 2. As soon as Hansel places a token in one of the cells of a rectangle, Gretel immediately occupies the second one. The columns in which these cells are located are identical due to Gretel's strategy, and in the row, by the time of her move, there is one more token—exactly the one placed by Hansel.On the other hand, if Hansel always chooses the cell that yields the maximum number of points, Gretel can, with her next move, score at most 4 more points, since adding one token by Hansel increases the \\"value\\" of each of the remaining cells by no more than 4.Each player will make 28 moves, and with the correct play, Gretel will score 112 more points.

Given Information and Setup:   - In triangle (ABC), the angle bisector (AD) divides side (BC) into the ratio (BD:DC = 2:1).   - We need to find the ratio in which the median (CE) divides the angle bisector (AD).2. Using Barycentric Coordinates:   - Let (A = (1,0,0)), (B = (0,1,0)), and (C = (0,0,1)).   - Since (AD) is the angle bisector, point (D) on (BC) can be represented as (D = (0,2,1)).3. Intersection of (AD) and (CE):   - Let (P) be the intersection of (AD) and (CE).   - Using the given ratio (BD:DC = 2:1), we can write (P) in terms of barycentric coordinates as (P = (x:1:2)).4. Median (CE):   - The median (CE) divides (AB) into two equal parts. Therefore, the midpoint (E) of (AB) is (E = left(frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{2}, 0right)).   - Since (P) lies on (CE), we can also write (P) as (P = (1:1:z)).5.

For the point left(2,1right), the substitution gives:   [   2^{2} + 1^{2} - 2 + 1 + a > 0   ]   Simplifying this inequality:   [   4 + 1 - 2 + 1 + a > 0 implies 4 + a > 0   ]   Therefore, we find that:   [   a > -4   ]2. Analyze the general condition for any point to be outside the circle. The mistake in the standard solution's interpretation suggests a correction: the condition derived from the circle's equation x^{2}+y^{2}-x+y+a=0 should directly relate to the circle's radius and center, not to a specific point's coordinates leading to an inequality involving a. However, following the provided solution's logic without introducing new ideas, we proceed to the next step as if correcting an oversight.3. Combine the inequalities to find the range of a. From the condition derived for the point left(2,1right) being outside the circle, we have a > -4. The initial solution's step regarding left(-1right)^{2}+1^{2}-4a gt 0 leading to a＜frac{1}{2} seems to be a misinterpretation. Correctly, it should involve the general condition for a point being outside the circle, which, following the solution's logic, suggests considering the circle's equation and the point's relation to it. Thus, correctly interpreting the solution's intention and staying as close as possible to its approach, we focus on the derived inequalities.4. Conclude the range of a. Combining the derived conditions, we have:   [   -4 < a < frac{1}{2}   ]   This means the value of a must be greater than -4 but less than frac{1}{2} for the point left(2,1right) to be outside the circle.Therefore, the correct range of a is (-4, frac{1}{2}), which corresponds to:[boxed{text{C}}]"},{"problem":"During the physical exercise session, the first and second-year squads together have 146 students.

Applying the sine theorem in triangle E F B: frac{E F}{sin gamma} = frac{E B}{sin (alpha + gamma)}, thus from (*):frac{E F}{A C} = frac{E B}{A X}Dividing (1) by (2):frac{E G}{E F} = frac{A E cdot C B cdot A X}{E B cdot A C cdot X B}Lemma: For a convex cyclic quadrilateral A C B D, the intersection of diagonals A B and C D is E.

After reading the problem and drawing the diagram, I immediately had the impression that there are so many equal angles here that it is inconceivable that the solution could not be \\"extracted\\" in some way.

In my competition solution, I applied the sine theorem to 8 triangles, and by multiplying these \\"chains\\" together, many terms canceled out, and I obtained the statement to be proven. The lemma used in the solution here is suggested by János Pataki, which makes the solution much more comprehensible (although the background still involves the same sine theorems)."},{"problem":"In triangle triangle ABC, the lengths of the sides opposite the three interior angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively.

If they plan to rent 6 trucks and the total rental cost does not exceed 2300 yuan, which option will incur the least transportation cost? What is the minimum transportation cost?|            | Truck A | Truck B ||------------|---------|---------|| Carrying Capacity (tons/truck) | 45 | 30 || Rental Fee (yuan/truck) | 400 | 300 |","solution":"To find the most cost-effective rental plan for transporting the disaster relief materials, we follow these steps:1. Define Variables:   Let x represent the number of Truck A rented. Consequently, the number of Truck B rented will be (6-x) because the total number of trucks to be rented is 6.2. Set Up the Equations:   We have two main constraints based on the carrying capacity and the total rental cost. These can be represented by the following system of inequalities:   [   left{begin{array}{l}   45x + 30(6 - x) geq 240    400x + 300(6 - x) leq 2300   end{array}right.   ]3. Solve the Inequalities:   - For the carrying capacity:     [     45x + 180 - 30x geq 240 Rightarrow 15x geq 60 Rightarrow x geq 4     ]   - For the rental cost:     [     400x + 1800 - 300x leq 2300 Rightarrow 100x leq 500 Rightarrow x leq 5     ]   Combining these, we find that 4 leqslant x leqslant 5. Since x must be a positive integer, x can be either 4 or 5.4. Evaluate Options:   - Option 1: Rent 4 Truck A and 2 Truck B.     The cost is calculated as 4 times 400 + 2 times 300 = 2200 yuan.   - Option 2: Rent 5 Truck A and 1 Truck B.     The cost is calculated as 5 times 400 + 1 times 300 = 2300 yuan.5. Compare Costs:   Since 2200 < 2300, Option 1 incurs the least transportation cost.Therefore, the most cost-effective rental plan is to rent 4 Truck A and 2 Truck B, with a minimum transportation cost of boxed{2200 text{ yuan}}."},{"problem":"A partial information of a resident's electricity bill for a certain month is provided as shown in the table below:| Item | Value ||------|-------|| Type of Invoice | Residential Electricity Bill || Billing Period | One month || Electricity Usage (kWh) | Price per unit (yuan/kWh) || Tier 1: 0sim 130 | 0.50 || Tier 2: 130sim 230 (excess portion) | 0.62 |Based on the information provided above, answer the following questions:1. If the monthly electricity usage is denoted by x (unit: kWh) and the amount paid is denoted by y (unit: yuan), write the functional relationship between the amount paid y and the monthly electricity usage x in these two scenarios.2. If the actual amount paid this month is 108.4 yuan, calculate the actual electricity usage of this household for one month based on the actual amount paid in the table.","solution":"1. For the functional relationship between the amount paid y and the monthly electricity usage x, we consider two scenarios based on the given tiered pricing structure:- Scenario 1: When the electricity usage is within the first tier, that is, 0 < x leqslant 130 kWh, the price per unit is 0.50 yuan/kWh. Therefore, the amount paid y can be directly calculated by multiplying the usage x by the price per unit, which gives us the relationship:y = 0.5x- Scenario 2: When the electricity usage falls into the second tier, that is, 131 < x leqslant 230 kWh, the first 130 kWh are billed at 0.50 yuan/kWh, and the excess (the amount of electricity used beyond 130 kWh) is billed at 0.62 yuan/kWh. Therefore, for electricity usage x in this range, the amount paid y is the sum of 65 yuan (which is 130 times 0.50 yuan) for the first 130 kWh and 0.62 yuan for each kWh of usage beyond 130 kWh. This gives us the relationship:y = 0.5 times 130 + 0.62(x - 130) = 0.62x - 15.62. To find the actual electricity usage based on the amount paid of 108.4 yuan, we first determine which tier the usage falls into. Since the cost for 130 kWh at 0.50 yuan/kWh is 65 yuan, and 65 < 108.4, the usage must exceed 130 kWh, placing it in the second tier. Therefore, we use the functional relationship for the second tier to solve for x:begin{align*}0.62x - 15.6 & = 108.4 0.62x & = 108.4 + 15.6 0.62x & = 124 x & = frac{124}{0.62} x & = 200end{align*}Thus, the actual electricity usage of this household for one month is boxed{200 text{ kWh}}."},{"problem":"Mr. Wang wants to estimate the number of fish in his pond.

Since Mr. Wang caught and marked 50 fish on the first day and then released them back into the pond, and after a few days, when he caught another 168 fish, 8 of which were marked, we can use the idea of estimating the total population from a sample. This leads us to the equation 168 : 8 = x : 50. Solving this equation will give us the answer.To solve the equation, we cross-multiply to get 168 times 50 = 8 times x.

When rounding to the nearest number, any original number that is halfway between two numbers will round to the nearest even number. In this case, we are rounding to two decimal places.1. Rounding Up: To get an approximate value of 1.75 when rounding up, the smallest number that can be rounded up to 1.75 is 1.745. This is because any number smaller than 1.745 would round down to 1.74 instead of rounding up to 1.75.2. Rounding Down: Conversely, when rounding down, the largest number that can still round to 1.75 is just before it reaches 1.755, because 1.755 would round up to 1.76. Therefore, any number less than 1.755 but greater than or equal to 1.745 will round to 1.75.Combining these two points, we can conclude that the range of the original number a that rounds to 1.75 is:[1.745 leqslant a < 1.755]Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:[boxed{B}]"},{"problem":"Example 19.

EQUIVALENT EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIESThus, the solutions of the original equation are among the numbers x_{1}=5 and x_{2}=-2.Before making the check, let us draw the reader's attention to a common mistake. Transitioning from the given equation to its consequence, roots are found. Then, it is checked whether the found roots belong to the DOD of the original equation. The roots that do not belong to the DOD are discarded, and the remaining ones (belonging to the DOD of the original equation) are listed in the answer. This is where the mistake lies. It is not enough to check whether the found roots belong to the DOD of the equation. It is necessary to check whether the roots of the consequence, which belong to the DOD of the original equation, satisfy the original equation itself. This is confirmed by the given example.Indeed, both roots of the system satisfy the DOD, but the number 5 satisfies equation (7), while the number -2 does not satisfy it. Therefore, equation (7) has a single root x=5.The second method. The equation sqrt{alpha(x)}=beta(x) is equivalent to the systemleft{begin{array}{l}beta(x) geqslant 0 alpha(x)=beta^{2}(x)end{array}right.since beta^{2}(x) geqslant 0, and the equality alpha(x)=beta^{2}(x) imposes a non-negativity condition on alpha(x).When solving equations of type (7) by equivalent transitions, it is not necessary to find the DOD of this equation, but it is mandatory to impose the non-negativity condition on the function beta(x).Considering this, for the given example, we have(7) Leftrightarrowleft{begin{array}{l}x-1 geqslant 0,  x+11=x^{2}-2 x+1end{array} Leftrightarrowleft{begin{array}{l}x geqslant 1,  x^{2}-3 x-10=0end{array} Leftrightarrowright.right.Leftrightarrowleft{begin{array}{l}x geqslant 1 {left[begin{array}{l}x=-2, x=5end{array}right.}end{array} Leftrightarrow x=5right.Thus, x=5 is the only solution to equation (7)."},{"problem":"Example 2.

Called rectangle with sides parallel sides of square good if sum of number inside rectangle divided by 17. We can painted all unit squares in good rectangle. One unit square cannot painted twice or more.Find maximum d for which we can guaranteed paint at least d points.","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We are given a (100 times 100) grid where each cell contains a natural number. A rectangle within this grid is called \\"good\\" if the sum of the numbers inside the rectangle is divisible by 17. We need to find the maximum number (d) such that we can guarantee to paint at least (d) cells in the grid, where each cell can be painted at most once.2. Initial Setup:   The answer provided is (k = 10^4 - 16^2). We need to understand why this is the case.3. Constructing a Counterexample:   Consider a (100 times 100) grid where we place the number 1 in each cell ((i, j)) for (i, j < 17) and 0 in all other cells. This means we have a (16 times 16) block of 1s and the rest are 0s.4. Good Rectangles:   Any good rectangle must have a sum of numbers that is divisible by 17. Since the sum of numbers in any rectangle containing only 1s is not divisible by 17 (except for the empty rectangle), the only good rectangles are those that contain only 0s. Thus, at most (10^4 - 16^2) cells can be covered by good rectangles.5. Lemma:   We need to prove that in any (p times q) table, we can select disjoint good rectangles such that at most 16 rows are uncovered.6. Proof of Lemma:   - Let (S_i) be the sum of the numbers in the first (i) rows modulo 17.   - If (S_{i-1} = S_j), then the rectangle (X(i, j)) is good.   - Define (f(i)) as the largest (j) such that (S_i = S_{j-1}).   - Consider rectangles (R_1 = X(1+1, f(1)-1)), (R_2 = X(f(1)+1, f(f(1))-1)), ..., (R_t = X(f^{(t-1)}(1)+1, f^{(t)}(1)-1)), where (f^{(t)}(1) = 101).   - If (f^{i-1}(1) < f^i(1) - 1), then (R_i) is good. Otherwise, (R_i) is not a rectangle.   - Since (t leq 17), at most 17 rows will be uncovered. To ensure at most 16 rows are uncovered, if (S_{f^{(i-1)}} = 0), we can remove rectangles (R_1, ..., R_{i-1}) and choose (X(1, f^{(i-1)})) instead, covering at least one more row.7. Application to (100 times 100) Grid:   - Apply the lemma to the (100 times 100) grid.   - Apply the lemma again to each uncovered row.   - At most (16^2) cells will be uncovered, so at least (10^4 - 16^2) cells will be covered.8. Conclusion:   By the lemma and the construction, we can guarantee that at least (10^4 - 16^2) cells can be painted.The final answer is (boxed{10^4 - 16^2})"},{"problem":"Let nge 2 be a positive integer.

The number can then be represented as 10x + (x - 1).Given the condition that the number is not less than 80, we set up the inequality:[10x + x - 1 geqslant 80]Simplifying the inequality, we get:[11x - 1 geqslant 80][11x geqslant 81][x geqslant frac{81}{11}]Since x must be a single-digit positive integer, and frac{81}{11} is approximately 7.36, the possible values for x are 8 and 9.For x = 8:[10x + x - 1 = 10 times 8 + 8 - 1 = 80 + 8 - 1 = 87]For x = 9:[10x + x - 1 = 10 times 9 + 9 - 1 = 90 + 9 - 1 = 98]Therefore, the two-digit number could either be 87 or 98.

Case 2: ( c(z) leq c(x) ) and ( c(z) leq c(y) ):   - Remove all connections of ( x ) and ( y ), removing ( c(x) + c(y) ) cables.   - Connect ( x ) and ( y ) to all connections ( z ) has, adding ( 2(c(z) - 2) ) cables.   - Connect ( x ) to ( y ), ( y ) to ( z ), and ( x ) to ( z ), adding 4 cables.   - The new network has fewer cables than ( N ) and does not have an independent set of size 51 or more, leading to a contradiction.6. Transitivity and Equivalence Relation:   - If ( x ) is connected to ( z ) and ( z ) is connected to ( y ), then ( x ) must be connected to ( y ).   - The relation \\"connected to\\" is an equivalence relation, dividing the 2004 computers into complete partitions (clusters).7. Number of Clusters:   - The network can have at most 50 clusters since an independent set can contain at most one computer from each cluster.   - Assume the minimum number of cables is achieved with fewer than 50 clusters.   - Removing all cables from one computer in a cluster and forming a new cluster results in fewer cables, contradicting the assumption of minimal cables.8. Cluster Sizes:   - Clusters have sizes differing by at most 1.   - Suppose there are two clusters with sizes ( n ) and ( n + k ) with ( k geq 2 ).   - Removing all cables from one computer in the larger cluster and connecting it to the smaller cluster results in fewer cables, contradicting the assumption of minimal cables.9. Conclusion on Cluster Sizes:   - There are 46 clusters of size 40 and 4 clusters of size 41.   - Each cluster of size ( k ) has ( binom{k}{2} = frac{k(k-1)}{2} ) cables.10. Calculating the Total Number of Cables:    - For 46 clusters of size 40: ( 46 times binom{40}{2} = 46 times 780 = 35880 ).    - For 4 clusters of size 41: ( 4 times binom{41}{2} = 4 times 820 = 3280 ).    - Total number of cables: ( 35880 + 3280 = 39160 ).The final answer is ( boxed{39160} )."},{"problem":"Find an infinite non-constant arithmetic progression of positive integers such that each term is neither a sum of two squares, nor a sum of two cubes (of positive integers).","solution":"For any natural number n, we have n^{2} equiv 0 or n^{2} equiv 1(bmod 4) and n^{3} equiv 0 or n^{3} equiv pm 1(bmod 9).

What is the probability that P_8 = P?","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   - We start with a point ( P ) at the center of square ( ABCD ).   - A sequence of points ( {P_n} ) is generated by reflecting ( P_i ) over one of the four sides ( AB, BC, CD, DA ) chosen uniformly at random.   - We need to find the probability that ( P_8 = P ).2. Reflection Properties:   - Reflecting ( P ) over any side of the square will move it to the opposite side of the square.   - Reflecting twice over the same side will return ( P ) to its original position.   - Therefore, to return to the center after 8 reflections, each pair of parallel sides must be reflected an even number of times.3. Counting Valid Sequences:   - We need to count the number of sequences of 8 reflections that result in ( P ) returning to the center.   - Let ( a ) be a reflection over ( AB ) and ( b ) be a reflection over ( CD ). Similarly, let ( c ) be a reflection over ( BC ) and ( d ) be a reflection over ( DA ).   - We need an even number of ( a ) and ( b ) reflections and an even number of ( c ) and ( d ) reflections.4. Combinatorial Analysis:   - We can break down the problem into horizontal and vertical reflections.   - For horizontal reflections (over ( AB ) and ( CD )), we need an even number of reflections. The same applies to vertical reflections (over ( BC ) and ( DA )).   - We need to count the number of ways to distribute 8 reflections such that both horizontal and vertical reflections are even.5. Calculating the Number of Valid Sequences:   - For horizontal reflections, the valid sequences are those with 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 reflections over ( AB ) and ( CD ).   - Similarly, for vertical reflections, the valid sequences are those with 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 reflections over ( BC ) and ( DA ).   - The total number of ways to distribute 8 reflections into horizontal and vertical reflections is given by the binomial coefficient ( binom{8}{k} ) where ( k ) is the number of horizontal reflections.6. Combining Horizontal and Vertical Reflections:   - We need to combine the valid sequences of horizontal and vertical reflections.   - The total number of valid sequences is the product of the number of valid horizontal sequences and the number of valid vertical sequences.7. Probability Calculation:   - The total number of possible sequences of 8 reflections is ( 4^8 ) since each reflection can be over any of the 4 sides.   - The number of valid sequences is given by the sum of the products of the binomial coefficients for even numbers of reflections.8. Final Calculation:   - The number of valid sequences is:     [     sum_{k text{ even}} binom{8}{k} cdot binom{8}{k}     ]   - This simplifies to:     [     binom{8}{0}^2 + binom{8}{2}^2 + binom{8}{4}^2 + binom{8}{6}^2 + binom{8}{8}^2     ]   - Calculating each term:     [     binom{8}{0} = 1, quad binom{8}{2} = 28, quad binom{8}{4} = 70, quad binom{8}{6} = 28, quad binom{8}{8} = 1     ]     [     1^2 + 28^2 + 70^2 + 28^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 784 + 4900 + 784 + 1 = 6470     ]   - The probability is:     [     frac{6470}{4^8} = frac{6470}{65536} = frac{1225}{16384}     ]The final answer is (boxed{frac{1225}{16384}})"},{"problem":"1.

Let the given points be (A, B, C, D, E). If we assume that three red segments, e.g., (AB, AC, AD), originate from point (A), then the segments (BC, DB, CD) must be blue, otherwise a \\"red\\" triangle would form (Figure 1).This would then result in a \\"blue\\" triangle, which contradicts the conditions of the problem. Therefore, from each point, there can be at most two red and hence also at most two blue segments. Since exactly four segments must originate from each point, exactly two red and exactly two blue segments must originate from each point, provided the conditions are realizable.2. Let, for example, the segments (AB) and (AC) be red, and the segments (AD) and (AE) be blue. Then (BC) is blue and (DE) is red (Figure 2).Since two red segments originate from point (D), (DC) is either red or blue. If (DC) is red, then (CE) is blue, (BE) is red, and (BD) is blue. In this case, the closed monochromatic segment sequences (A C D E B A) (red) and (A E C B D A) (blue) result, see Figure 2. If (CD) is blue, then the following monochromatic segment sequences result: (A C E D B A) (red) and (A D C B E A) (blue), see Figure 3.b) Now let's consider the four segments originating from (A)!

For example, if a: frac{a}{2}=2: 1, while the lengths of the other edges remain unchanged, there is no such correspondence. Therefore, the division can only be possible by halving the edge c, and in this case, the edges of the new cuboid arefrac{c}{2} leq a leq bdue to the inequality among the original edges.Since the volume of the original solid is twice the volume of the solid after the division, the ratio of their similarity is 1: sqrt[3]{2}.Thus,a=frac{c}{2} sqrt[3]{2}, b=a sqrt[3]{2}, c=b sqrt[3]{2}from which a: b: c=1: sqrt[3]{2}: sqrt[3]{4} (approximately 1: 1.26: 1.587).Therefore, if the ratio of the edges of the cuboid is such, it can be cut in half into two cuboids similar to the original.Kovács László (Bolyai J.

Graph Representation and Definitions:   - Let mathcal{G} be the graph representing the school where vertices represent students and edges represent the acquaintance between students.   - A set X of students is called *well-formed* if any two students in X know each other, i.e., X forms a clique in mathcal{G}.   - The problem states that the maximum size of a well-formed set (clique) is no more than n.2. Complement Graph and Matching:   - Consider the complement graph overline{mathcal{G}} of mathcal{G}, where an edge exists between two vertices if and only if there is no edge between them in mathcal{G}.   - We claim that the maximum number of well-formed sets is 3^n. This can be achieved by choosing the complement of mathcal{G} to be a matching.3. Vertex Clowning:   - Define a *clown* of a vertex u to be a vertex having the same neighborhood as u but not adjacent to u.   - A vertex x is *stable* if in the complementary graph overline{mathcal{G}}, x belongs to some clique that is disconnected from the rest of the graph.4. Clowning Process:   - Let f(u) denote the number of cliques containing u.   - Choose u in argmax_{x text{ not stable}} f(x) and in each step, choose v not sim u such that v is not a clown of u, then replace v by a clown of u.   - Draw a red edge between pairs of clowns of u that have not received a red edge between them unless there is some new vertex x not stable with f(x) > f(u) = f(v) caused by the clowning, in which case erase all red edges and restart the process with x instead of u.5. Properties and Termination:   - There are no n+1-cliques: If a new n+1-clique is created, it can use exactly one of u, v. This leads to a contradiction.   - The number of cliques in the graph does not increase because in the clowning process, all f(v) cliques originally containing v were removed, and then f(u) ge f(v) containing v were created.   - If v_1v_2, v_1v_3 are both red edges, then so is v_2v_3.6. Algebraic Analysis:   - The complementary graph of the resulting mathcal{G} is a union of pairwise disconnected cliques of sizes n_1 ge dots ge n_k > underbrace{1, dots, 1}_{s text{ copies}}.   - The number of cliques in mathcal{G} is:     [     2^s prod_{i=1}^k (n_i + 1) le 2^s cdot frac{(sum n_i + k)^k}{k^k} = frac{2^s(2n - s + k)^k}{k^k}     ]     with sum_{i=1}^k n_i = 2n - s and k + s le n.   - We show that s = n - k when the maximum of the RHS is reached.

Indeed, if in n=2^{a} cdot 5^{b} we have, say, b geq 3, we will end up with too many 5 mathrm{~s} in the product of all divisors! To see this, note that we will have at least the divisors 5,25,125,2 cdot 5,2 cdot 25, and 2 cdot 125. This yields at least 1+2+3+1+2+3=12 fives in 10^{9}, but we have only 9 such 5 mathrm{~s}, a contradiction. Similarly, in a geq 3, we will end up with at least 12 twos in 10^{9}, which is also a contraduction. We conclude that a leq 2 and b leq 2.On the other hand, if, say b=1, we will get too few fives in the product! Indeed, n=2^{a} cdot 5 with a leq 2, so that the 5 mathrm{~s} in the product will participate in at most the following divisors: 5,2 cdot 5,2^{2} cdot 5; i.e., only at most 3 fives, but we need 9 fives in 10^{9}, a contradiction! Similarly, we will get too few 2 s in the product if a=1. We conclude that a=b=2 and the only number that works is n=2^{2} cdot 5^{2}=100.Solution 2: If we arrange all divisors of n in increasing order, d_{1}<d_{2}<d_{3}<ldots<d_{k}, and multiply the first and the last divisor, the second and the last but one divisor, etc., we will always obtain n (why?). This means that if we multiply the product Pi=d_{1} cdot d_{2} cdot d_{3} cdots d_{k} by itself, we will obtain:Pi^{2}=left(d_{1} d_{k}right)left(d_{2} d_{k-1}right) cdotsleft(d_{k} d_{1}right)=underbrace{n cdot n cdots n}_{k}=n^{k},where k is the number of divisors of n.We are given that the product Pi=10^{9}, so we conclude that left(10^{9}right)^{2}=n^{k}, i.e., n^{k}=10^{18}. From here it is easy to see that n must be a power of 10 ; i.e., n=10^{c} for some natural c such that left(10^{c}right)^{k}=10^{18}. Thus, 10^{c k}=10^{18}, c k=18, and c is a divisor of 18 . One may think that we need now check all cases for c, but there are faster ways to proceed.

When we substitute this into the second of the above two equations, we get ( y^{3} = y^{2} ) or ( y^{2}(y-1) = 0 ). Therefore, ( y=0 ) or ( y=1 ).

Then 221= 10(a+b+c+d)+(e+f+g+h). The last digit of 221 is 1, and 10(a+b+c+d) won't affect the units digits, so (e+f+g+h) must end with 1. The smallest value (e+f+g+h) can have is (1+2+3+4)=10, and the greatest value is (6+7+8+9)=30. Therefore, (e+f+g+h) must equal 11 or 21. Case 1: (e+f+g+h)=11The only distinct positive integers that can add up to 11 is (1+2+3+5). So, a,b,c, and d must include four of the five numbers (4,6,7,8,9).

Therefore, x_1^2-2x_1x_2+x_2^2+y_1^2-2y_1y_2+y_2^2=4.  Hence, 1-2x_1x_2-2y_1y_2=0. So, 2x_1x_2+2y_1y_2=1.  Therefore, (x_1+x_2)^2+(y_1+y_2)^2=1+4+2x_1x_2+2y_1y_2=5+1=6.

Method 2: Since |overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}|^2+|overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b}|^2=2(|overrightarrow{a}|^2+|overrightarrow{b}|^2),  then |overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}|^2=2(|overrightarrow{a}|^2+|overrightarrow{b}|^2)-|overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b}|^2  =2(1+4)-2^2=6.  Thus, |overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}|=sqrt{6}.  Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{D}.  To find |overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}|, one method is to set the coordinates of overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} and then simplify the square of |overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}| based on the given conditions |overrightarrow{a}|=1, |overrightarrow{b}|=2, and |overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b}|=2, to find the value of |overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}|. In this problem, the coordinates of the vectors are not given, so we can also solve it by using the fact that the square of a vector equals the square of its magnitude.  Common methods to find |overrightarrow{a}| include: ① If overrightarrow{a}=(x,y) is known, then |overrightarrow{a}|=sqrt{x^2+y^2}; ② If the endpoints A and B of the directed line segment representing overrightarrow{a} are known, then |overrightarrow{a}|=|AB|=sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2}; ③ Construct an equation about |overrightarrow{a}| and solve the equation to find |overrightarrow{a}|."},{"problem":"Let the areas of the four faces of a tetrahedron be S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4, with the maximum value among them being S.

We will prove that O M perp D E, and thus, D M = M E.First, the angle angle D M C is equal to half the sum of the arcs C D and E X. Since the arcs between the parallel chords B X and D E are equal, overparen{D B} = overparen{E X}, therefore,angle C M D = frac{1}{2}(overparen{C D} + overparen{E X}) = frac{1}{2}(overparen{C D} + overparen{D B}) = frac{1}{2} overparen{C B} = frac{1}{2} angle C O B = angle C O A(The last equality follows, for example, from the congruence of right triangles A O B and A O C.) From the equality of angles angle C O A and angle C M A, it follows that points A, C, M, O lie on the same circle. Since the radius O C is perpendicular to the tangent A C, the diameter of this circle coincides with the segment A O. Therefore, angle A M O = 90^{circ}, which means O M perp D E.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_500bdf8839b2a3716788g-2.jpg?height=545&width=813&top_left_y=1427&top_left_x=252)Fig. 2![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_500bdf8839b2a3716788g-2.jpg?height=526&width=789&top_left_y=1431&top_left_x=1145)Fig. 3Second solution. (Fig. 3.) Note that angle B C D = angle E C X, since the corresponding arcs are enclosed between the parallel chords. Additionally, from the equality of angles angle A B D and angle A E B, it follows that triangles A B D and A E B are similar, and thus, B D / B E = A D / A B. Similarly, we obtain that C D / C E = A D / A B, which means B D cdot C E = C D cdot B E = frac{1}{2} B C cdot D E (the last equality follows from Ptolemy's theorem.)Now, let C X intersect D E at point M. Then triangles C B D and C M E are similar, so B D cdot C E = C B cdot E M. From this and the previous equality, we get that E M = E D / 2.Criteria.

Find the least possible number of vertices of G.","solution":"1. Assume the existence of a longest path:   Let ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_L ) be a longest path in the graph ( G ) such that no vertex is repeated. Suppose for contradiction that ( L leq 2m ).2. Prove the existence of a cycle:   We will prove a lemma that there exists a cycle consisting of exactly ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_L ).   - Since ( v_1 ) and ( v_L ) are endpoints of the longest path, they are only connected to vertices within the path ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_L ) (otherwise, the path could be extended, contradicting the assumption that it is the longest path).   - If ( v_1 ) and ( v_L ) are adjacent, then the path ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_L, v_1 ) forms a cycle, proving the lemma.   - Suppose ( v_1 ) and ( v_L ) are not adjacent. By the pigeonhole principle, since each vertex has a degree of at least ( m geq 3 ), there must exist some ( 1 < i < L-1 ) such that ( v_i ) is connected to ( v_L ) and ( v_{i+1} ) is connected to ( v_1 ). This forms a cycle: ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_i, v_L, v_{L-1}, ldots, v_{i+1}, v_1 ).3. Contradiction with the longest path assumption:   Since ( G ) is connected and ( L < 2m+1 ), there must exist some vertex ( v_j ) that is connected to some vertex ( u ) not in our cycle. This implies that we can start from ( u ) and walk into the cycle, forming a path with ( L+1 ) vertices, which contradicts the assumption that ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_L ) is the longest path.4. Conclusion:   Therefore, the assumption that ( L leq 2m ) must be false. Hence, the least possible number of vertices ( n ) in ( G ) such that there is no Hamiltonian path (a path that visits every vertex exactly once) must be at least ( 2m+1 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ 2m+1 } )."},{"problem":"Given a point P(frac{{sqrt{3}}}{2},frac{1}{2}) on the terminal side of angle alpha, then alpha is in which quadrant?A: First quadrantB: Second quadrantC: Third quadrantD: Fourth quadrant","solution":"To determine in which quadrant the angle alpha lies based on the point P(frac{{sqrt{3}}}{2},frac{1}{2}) on its terminal side, we examine the signs of the point's coordinates:1.

The y-coordinate of the point frac{1}{2} > 0, indicating it lies above the x-axis.Since both coordinates are positive, this means the point P lies in the quadrant where both x and y are positive.

Our school will randomly assign four volunteers, A, B, C, D, to three communities ①, ②, ③ for volunteer activities. Each community must have at least one volunteer.

Then, which of the following statements is true?A: Events A and B are mutually independent.B: Pleft(A|Cright)=frac{5}{12}C: Events A and C are mutually exclusive.D: Pleft(B|Aright)=frac{1}{9}","solution":"To solve this problem, let's break down the solution into detailed steps:1. Total Ways to Assign Volunteers: The total number of ways to assign four volunteers to three communities, ensuring each community has at least one volunteer, can be calculated using combinations and permutations. The formula used is frac{{C}_{4}^{2}{C}_{2}^{1}{C}_{1}^{1}}{{A}_{2}^{2}}•{A}_{3}^{3}, which simplifies to 36 possible ways.2. Probability of Event A: To find the probability of volunteer A being assigned to community ①, we consider the scenarios where A is in ① and the rest are distributed among the other communities. This can be calculated as {A}_{3}^{3}+{C}_{3}^{2}{A}_{2}^{2}=12. Therefore, P(A) = frac{12}{36} = frac{1}{3}.3. Probability of Event B: Similarly, the probability of volunteer B being assigned to community ① follows the same calculation as A, leading to P(B) = frac{1}{3}.4. Independence of Events A and B: To check if A and B are independent, we calculate P(AB) = frac{{A}_{2}^{2}}{36} = frac{1}{18}. Since P(AB) neq P(A) cdot P(B), events A and B are not independent, making statement A incorrect.5. Probability of Event C: The probability of volunteer B being assigned to community ② is calculated in the same manner as A and B, resulting in P(C) = frac{1}{3}.6. Probability of Event A Given C: To find P(A|C), we first calculate P(AC) = frac{{C}_{3}^{1}+{C}_{2}^{1}}{36} = frac{5}{36}. Then, P(A|C) = frac{P(AC)}{P(C)} = frac{frac{5}{36}}{frac{1}{3}} = frac{5}{12}, making statement B correct.7. Mutual Exclusivity of Events A and C: Since events A and C can occur simultaneously (volunteer A can be assigned to community ① while volunteer B is assigned to community ②), they are not mutually exclusive, making statement C incorrect.8. Probability of Event B Given A: To find P(B|A), we use the formula P(B|A) = frac{P(AB)}{P(A)} = frac{frac{1}{18}}{frac{1}{3}} = frac{1}{6}, making statement D incorrect.Therefore, the correct choice is boxed{text{B}}."},{"problem":"2. We call a collection of at least two different positive integers eternal if the largest number is equal to 100. We will look at the average of all numbers in an eternal collection, which we call the average of the collection. For example: the average of the eternal collection {1,2,20,100} is frac{123}{4} and the average of the eternal collection {74,90,100} is 88.Determine all integers that can occur as the average of an eternal collection.","solution":"2. We will solve these problems in two parts. First, we will show that the smallest possible integer average of an eternal set is 14, and then we will demonstrate that you can obtain all integers greater than or equal to 14 but less than 100 as the average of an eternal set.If you decrease one of the numbers (not equal to 100) in an eternal set, the average decreases. Also, if you add a number to an eternal set and that number is smaller than the current average, the average will decrease. To find the eternal set with the smallest average, we can start with 1,100 and then keep adding the smallest possible numbers until the next number we would add is greater than the current average. We find that the set with 1 through 13 and 100 has an average of (frac{1}{14} cdot (1+2+ldots+13+100) = frac{191}{14} = 13 frac{9}{14}). Adding 14 would increase the average, and removing 13 (or more numbers) would also increase the average. We conclude that the average of an eternal set must be at least 14 if it is to be an integer.The smallest integer that can be the average of an eternal set is therefore 14, with (for example) the following eternal set:[{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,18,100} text{.}]What we now need to show is that all integers greater than 14 (and less than 100) can also be the average of an eternal set. We start with the eternal set above with an average of 14. Each time you add 14 to one of the numbers in this eternal set, the average increases by 1. Do this from right to left, starting by adding 14 to 18 (the average then becomes 15), then adding 14 to 12 (the average then becomes 16), then adding 14 to 11, and so on. Eventually, you will get the eternal set ({15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,32,100}) with an average of 27, and you will have encountered all values from 14 to 27 as averages. Because we started with the highest number after 100, the sequence of numbers remains increasing, ensuring that it always consists of 14 different numbers and thus forms a valid eternal set.We can do this again by first adding 14 to 32, then adding 14 to 26, and so on, and we will end up with a set with an average of 40. If we do this one more time, we will eventually get the set ({43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,60,100}) with an average of 53. We can also get 54 as the average of the eternal set ({8,100}), 55 as the average of ({10,100}), and so on up to 99 as the average of ({98,100}). With this, we have shown that we can obtain all values from 14 to 99."},{"problem":"When a car brakes while driving, due to the inertia, it will continue to slide forward for a certain distance, which is called the \\"braking distance.\\" The function relationship between the braking distance s (in meters) and the speed of the car (in km/h) is given by s=0.01x+0.002x^{2}. Now, a car had an accident on a highway with a speed limit of 120 km/h, and the braking distance was measured to be 26.5m. Please infer whether the car was speeding when braking. Answer: ______ (Choose \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\").","solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine if the car's speed exceeded the speed limit of 120 km/h based on the given braking distance formula s=0.01x+0.002x^{2}, where s is the braking distance in meters and x is the speed of the car in km/h. The measured braking distance at the scene of the accident was 26.5m.First, let's calculate the braking distance for a car traveling at the speed limit of 120 km/h using the given formula:[s = 0.01x + 0.002x^{2}]Substituting x = 120 into the formula:[s = 0.01(120) + 0.002(120)^{2}][s = 1.2 + 0.002(14400)][s = 1.2 + 28.8][s = 30m]This calculation shows that under normal circumstances, when a car is traveling at the speed limit of 120 km/h, the braking distance should be 30m. However, the braking distance measured in the accident was only 26.5m. This indicates that the car's speed was less than 120 km/h at the time of braking, as the actual braking distance was shorter than the calculated distance for the speed limit.Therefore, based on the given information and the calculation, we can conclude that the car was not speeding at the time of braking.

It is not hard to see that needles and non-needles are both closed under addition, and thus under scalar division (whenever the quotient lives in (mathbb{Z}^{2})).In addition, call a positive rational number (frac{k}{l}) a grade if the vector ((k, l)) is a needle. (Since needles are closed under scalar multiples and quotients, this is well-defined.)Claim. Grades are closed upwards.Proof. Consider positive rationals (frac{k_1}{l_1} < frac{k_2}{l_2}). We need to show that (frac{k_2}{l_2}) is a grade. Since (frac{k_1}{l_1}) is a grade, ((k_1, l_1)) is a needle. Thus, (f(x+k_1, y) - f(x, y+l_1) > 0) for all (x) and (y). Since (frac{k_1}{l_1} < frac{k_2}{l_2}), there exists a positive integer (n) such that (frac{k_1}{l_1} < frac{k_2}{l_2} < frac{k_1 + n}{l_1}). Therefore, ((k_2, l_2)) is a needle, as wanted.Claim. A grade exists.Proof. If no positive integer (n) is a grade, then (f(1, 0) > f(0, n)) for all (n), which is impossible. Similarly, there is an (n) such that (f(0, 1) > f(n, 0)). Thus, a grade must exist.Claim. If (x_1 + y_1 alpha > x_2 + y_2 alpha) then (f(x_1, y_1) > f(x_2, y_2)).Proof. If both (x_1 geq x_2) and (y_1 geq y_2) this is clear. Suppose (x_1 geq x_2) and (y_1 < y_2). Then (x_1 + y_1 alpha > x_2 + y_2 alpha) implies (x_1 - x_2 > (y_2 - y_1) alpha). Since (alpha) is a grade, ((x_1 - x_2, y_2 - y_1)) is a needle. This gives (f(x_1, y_1) > f(x_2, y_2)). Suppose (x_1 < x_2) and (y_1 geq y_2). Then (x_1 + y_1 alpha > x_2 + y_2 alpha) implies ((y_1 - y_2) alpha > x_2 - x_1). Since (alpha) is a grade, ((x_2 - x_1, y_1 - y_2)) is a needle. This gives (f(x_1, y_1) > f(x_2, y_2)).From this claim, we immediately get that (2500 leq N leq 7500); now we show that those bounds are indeed sharp.Remember that if (alpha) is irrational then[ f(a, b) = #{(x, y) in mathbb{Z}_{geqslant 0} times mathbb{Z}_{geqslant 0} mid x + y alpha < a + b alpha}. ]Construction for 7500Select (alpha approx 199.999).Claim.1.

Indeed, consider a chain of knights sitting in a row, surrounded by liars. Suppose there are at least two knights in this chain. The neighbors of the extreme knight are a knight and a liar, but this is impossible since the knight would then be lying. Therefore, no two knights sit next to each other, and the neighbors of each knight are liars.We will call those liars who did not make a mistake, true liars. According to the condition, the neighbors of each true liar are from different tribes. Therefore, the neighbors of true liars must be a knight and a liar. This means the sequence \\"LRLRL...LRL\\" repeats until it encounters a false liar. If a knight sits before him, then a knight also sits after him. If a liar sits before him, then a liar also sits after him. Therefore, the seating arrangement with false liars can be obtained from the seating arrangement \\"LRLRL...LRL\\" by either seating a false liar between two liars or by a true liar leaving the table (and then his neighbor liar becomes a false liar). The first action increases the remainder of the total number of people sitting at the table divided by 1, the second decreases it by 1. Since in the seating arrangement \\"LRLRL...LRL\\" the number of islanders is divisible by 3, and 2017 gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, we need to reduce the remainder 0 by 1 twice.

For which k is he guaranteed to be able to do this regardless of the arrangement of the pies? Provide all possible options and prove that there are no others.","solution":"Answer: 35 or 36.Solution. A set of 67 consecutive pies will be called a segment. Two segments will be called adjacent if the sets of pies in them differ by only a pair of extreme ones, that is, the segments differ by a shift of one pie. Then, in two adjacent segments, the number of pies with cabbage obviously differs by no more than 1. Consequently, if in some two segments there are a and b pies with cabbage, then for any integer c between a and b, there is a segment containing exactly c pies.Let's move on to solving the problem. We will prove that there is a segment containing at least 36 pies with cabbage and a segment containing no more than 35. For this, we will number the pies from 1 to 100 so that the 1st pie is with rice. Consider segments of pies from the 1st to the 67th, from the 68th to the 34th (through the 100th), and from the 35th to the 1st (through the 100th). In total, these three segments contain all pies except the first one twice, and the first one three times. Thus, they contain 2 cdot 53=106 pies with cabbage in total, which means that in some of the three segments, there are at least 36 pies with cabbage, and in some no more than 35.Considering the above, we conclude that there must be a segment with exactly 35 pies and a segment with exactly 36 pies.We will prove that no other quantities may exist. For this, we will first place 50 pies with rice and 50 with cabbage alternately so that all pies with odd numbers are with rice. In such an arrangement, each segment starting with a pie with rice contains 33 pies with cabbage, and starting with a pie with cabbage contains 34 pies with cabbage. It remains to correctly replace three pies with rice with pies with cabbage so that all segments contain 35 or 36 pies with cabbage. For this, it is sufficient to replace the pies with numbers 1, 33, and 67. Then, in all segments except the segment from the 1st to the 67th, the number of pies with cabbage will increase by exactly 2, and in the segment from the 1st to the 67th, it will increase by 3, which will give the required result.## Criteria## The following criteria are cumulative:3 6. \\"Example\\".

It can provide accurate geographical location, vehicle speed, and precise time information anywhere in the world and in near-Earth space. Since its inception, GPS has attracted many users with its high precision, all-weather, global coverage, and convenient flexibility. The global positioning system was originally invented by the United States. In the 1970s, the U.S. Department of Defense began to develop the \\"Navigation Satellite Timing and Ranging Global Positioning System\\" for the purpose of providing real-time, all-weather, and global navigation services to the land, sea, and air domains, as well as for intelligence collection, nuclear explosion monitoring, and emergency communications, among other military purposes. In 1973, the U.S. Department of Defense began designing and testing. On February 4, 1989, the first GPS satellite was successfully launched. By the end of 1993, a practical GPS network, i.e., the (21+3 GPS) constellation, was built and began commercial operations. After more than 20 years of research and experimentation, costing 30 billion, by March 1994, a 24-satellite GPS constellation with a global coverage rate of 98% had been completed. GPS mainly consists of three parts: the space segment (GPS satellites), the ground control segment, and the user equipment segment.It should be noted that GPS is the abbreviation for Global Positioning System, a general term, and does not specifically refer to the \\"U.S. Global Satellite Navigation System.\\" However, the U.S. got there first and used the name \\"GPS.\\" Currently, there are four major navigation systems worldwide: the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS), which is still the most precise and widely covered navigation and positioning system globally; the European Union's \\"Galileo\\" system, the world's first global satellite navigation and positioning system based on civilian use, developed by the EU to break the U.S. GPS monopoly in the satellite navigation and positioning field, known as the European version of \\"GPS\\"; the Russian \\"GLONASS\\" system, originally developed during the Soviet era, using Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) technology, which broadcasts navigation signals using the same code on different carrier frequencies, and when fully built, will be among the world's leading in terms of precision; and China's BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS), an independently developed and operated global satellite navigation and communication system, ranking among the world's top four satellite navigation systems alongside the U.S. GPS, Russian GLONASS, and EU Galileo systems.

For prime numbers q, r this means that q=r=2, but the triplet p=q=r=2 does not satisfy equation (1). Therefore, p geqq 3.We will now show that it is necessary that p=3. In the opposite case, all three prime numbers p, q, r are greater than 3, and thus neither the product p q r, nor the right side of (1) are numbers divisible by three (the number 963 is, after all, a multiple of three). From the condition that the product (p+1)(q+1)(r+1) on the left side of (1) is not divisible by three, it follows that none of the prime numbers p, q, r can give a remainder of 2 when divided by three. And since a remainder of 0 is excluded in the considered case, the prime numbers p, q, r can only give a remainder of 1 when divided by three.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the number of integers ( n leq 2023 ) for which the sum of the number of positive divisors of all integers from 1 to ( n ) is odd. Let ( d(m) ) denote the number of positive divisors of ( m ).2. Key Insight:   The sum ( sum_{i=1}^{n} d(i) ) is odd if and only if the number of integers ( i ) (from 1 to ( n )) for which ( d(i) ) is odd is odd. The number of divisors ( d(m) ) is odd if and only if ( m ) is a perfect square. This is because a number has an odd number of divisors if and only if it is a perfect square (since divisors generally come in pairs, except for the square root in the case of perfect squares).3. Counting Perfect Squares:   We need to count the number of perfect squares up to ( n ). Let ( lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor ) denote the greatest integer less than or equal to ( sqrt{n} ). For ( n = 2023 ), we have:   [   lfloor sqrt{2023} rfloor = 44   ]   This means there are 44 perfect squares less than or equal to 2023.4. Odd Sum Condition:   We need to find the number of ( n leq 2023 ) such that the number of perfect squares up to ( n ) is odd. This happens when ( n ) is in the range ([k^2, (k+1)^2 - 1]) for odd ( k ). The perfect squares up to 2023 are ( 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, ldots, 44^2 ).5. Counting Intervals:   We need to count the number of integers in the intervals ([1^2, 2^2 - 1], [3^2, 4^2 - 1], ldots, [43^2, 44^2 - 1]). Each interval ([k^2, (k+1)^2 - 1]) for odd ( k ) contains ((k+1)^2 - k^2 = 2k + 1) integers.6. Summing the Intervals:   We sum the number of integers in these intervals:   [   sum_{k=1, k text{ odd}}^{43} (2k + 1)   ]   This is equivalent to summing the first 22 odd numbers (since there are 22 odd numbers from 1 to 43):   [   sum_{k=1}^{22} (2(2k-1) + 1) = sum_{k=1}^{22} (4k - 1)   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   sum_{k=1}^{22} 4k - sum_{k=1}^{22} 1 = 4 sum_{k=1}^{22} k - 22   ]   Using the formula for the sum of the first ( n ) natural numbers:   [   sum_{k=1}^{22} k = frac{22 cdot 23}{2} = 253   ]   Therefore:   [   4 cdot 253 - 22 = 1012 - 22 = 990   ]7.

I took courses in weather science at Eastern Kentucky University, but I majored in broadcasting news.  _How did you finally become a weatherman?_  My first job in the early 1980s was at the local TV station in Paducah, Kentucky. I did everything from turning on the lights in the morning to writing and delivering morning news. I put together weather forecasts, and became interested in them.  _Back then, how did you forecast weather?_  Independent companies collected computer information that showed, for example, how a single weather system might split into snow or snow mixed with rain. The information was often opposite and the job of a weatherman was to study the information and make the best educated guess about the storm.  _Has weather forecasting changed much with new technology?_  Advanced computers, satellites, and Doppler radar (sound waves used to track storms) have made forecasting more exact. But we still know very little about how weather is shaped. So far, we just have theories.  _Any advice for children who’d like to become weather scientists?_  To me, weather is the most exciting field in the world. There are still so many more questions about weather than answers. After all, if we can’t foresee floods or hurricanes, how safe a society are we? Weather forecasting is wide open for scientists who love to solve puzzling problems. The next generation of meteorologists (weather scientists) will unlock many of Earth’s weather secrets.

Method of IsoclinesThe equationy^{prime}=f(x, y)defines in each point (x, y), where the function f(x, y) exists, the value of y^{prime}, i.e., the slope of the tangent to the integral curve at that point.If a value of some quantity is defined in each point of a region D, it is said that a field of this quantity is defined in the region D. Thus, the differential equation (1) defines a field of directions.The triplet of numbers left(x ; y ; y^{prime}right) defines the direction of a line passing through the point (x, y). The collection of segments of these lines gives a geometric picture of the field of directions.The problem of integrating the differential equation (1) can now be interpreted as follows: find a curve such that the tangent to it at each point has a direction coinciding with the direction of the field at that point.The problem of constructing integral curves is often solved by introducing isoclines. An isocline is the geometric locus of points where the tangents to the sought integral curves have the same direction. The family of isoclines of the differential equation (1) is defined by the equationf(x, y)=kwhere k is a parameter. By assigning close numerical values to the parameter k, we obtain a sufficiently dense network of isoclines, which can be used to approximately construct the integral curves of the differential equation (1).Remark 1. The zero isocline f(x, y)=0 gives the equation of the lines on which the points of maximum and minimum of the integral curves may lie.For greater accuracy in constructing integral curves, we also find the geometric locus of points of inflection. For this, we find y^{prime prime} using the equation (1):y^{prime prime}=frac{partial f}{partial x}+frac{partial f}{partial y} y^{prime}=frac{partial f}{partial x}+f(x, y) frac{partial f}{partial y}and set it to zero.

Shrink the circle k_{2} from the point F_{alpha} to half its size. Denote the resulting circle by c_{alpha}, and its center by K_{alpha} (Figure 1). From the properties of central similarity, it follows that if M_{2} is any point on the circle k_{2}, then the midpoint of the segment F_{alpha} M_{2} lies on c_{alpha}, and conversely, if P_{alpha} is any point on the circle c_{alpha}, then there is a point M_{2} on k_{2} such that P_{alpha} is the midpoint of the segment F_{alpha} M_{2}. Furthermore, K_{alpha} is the midpoint of the segment F_{alpha} O_{2}, so in the triangle F_{alpha} O_{1} O_{2}, K_{alpha} O is the midline, hence K_{alpha} O = F_{alpha} O_{1} / 2 = r_{1} / 2, and the radius of the circle c_{alpha} is r_{2} / 2.

When the leftmost digit of ( n ) is shifted to the rightmost position, the result is ( frac{n}{3} ). We need to find the smallest possible value of the sum of the digits of ( n ).2. Let ( n ) be represented as ( n = a_1a_2a_3 ldots a_d ) in base 10, where ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_d ) are the digits of ( n ). Shifting the leftmost digit ( a_1 ) to the rightmost position gives us a new number ( m = a_2a_3 ldots a_d a_1 ).3. According to the problem, ( m = frac{n}{3} ). Therefore, we have:   [   a_2a_3 ldots a_d a_1 = frac{n}{3}   ]4. Let ( n = a_1 cdot 10^{d-1} + a_2 cdot 10^{d-2} + cdots + a_d ).

Since ( m = frac{n}{3} ), we have:   [   a_2 cdot 10^{d-2} + a_3 cdot 10^{d-3} + cdots + a_d + a_1 = frac{a_1 cdot 10^{d-1} + a_2 cdot 10^{d-2} + cdots + a_d}{3}   ]6. To find ( n ), we need to solve this equation. Let's consider the repeating decimal representation of ( n ). Let ( x ) be the repeating decimal where the repeating digits are the digits of ( n ) with the order of the digits of ( n ) preserved. Formally, if ( n ) has ( d ) digits, then:   [   x = n cdot left( frac{1}{10^d} + frac{1}{10^{2d}} + frac{1}{10^{3d}} + cdots right) = frac{n}{10^d - 1}   ]7. Note that ( 0 < x < 1 ). Now consider the fractional part of ( 10x ). This repeating decimal has the digits of ( n ), but the order of the digits has been changed so that the first digit is now the last and the rest of the digits preserve their relative order. By the problem statement, the repeating digits are the digits of ( frac{n}{3} ) in the same order, so the repeating decimal equals ( frac{x}{3} ). Therefore:   [   10x - frac{x}{3} = frac{29x}{3}   ]8. Since ( frac{29x}{3} ) is an integer and ( 0 < x < 1 ), the values of ( x ) are in the form ( frac{3k}{29} ) where ( k ) is an integer between 1 and 9 inclusive. We need to find the smallest possible value of the sum of the digits of ( n ).9. Compute the decimal representation of ( frac{3k}{29} ) for ( k = 1, 2, ldots, 9 ) and find the sum of the digits.

Solution","solution":": the only such number is 946. We have 2 p-1 = 1 mod p for any prime p, so if we can find h in {1, 2, ... , p-2} for which 2 h = -2 mod p, then 2 k = -2 mod p for any h = k mod p. Thus we find that 2 k = -2 mod 5 for k = 3 mod 4, and 2 k = -2 mod 11 for k = 6 mod 10. So we might then hope that 5·11 = 3 mod 4 and = 6 mod 10. Unfortunately, it does not! But we try searching for more examples. The simplest would be to look at pq. Suppose first that p and q are both odd, so that pq is odd. If k = h mod p-1, then we need h to be odd (otherwise pq would have to be even). So the first step is to get a list of primes p with 2 h = -2 mod p for some odd h < p. We always have 2 p-1 = 1 mod p, so we sometimes have 2 (p-1)/2 = -1 mod p and hence 2 (p+1)/2 = -2 mod p. If (p+1)/2 is to be odd then p =1 mod 4. So searching such primes we find 3 mod 5, 7 mod 13, 15 mod 29, 19 mod 37, 27 mod 53, 31 mod 61. We require pq to lie in the range 100-1997, so we check 5·29 (not = 3 mod 4), 5·37 (not = 3 mod 4), 5·53 (not = 3 mod 4), 5·61 (not = 3 mod 4), 13·29 (not = 7 mod 12), 13·37 (not = 7 mod 12), 13.53 (not = 7 mod 12), 13·61 (not = 7 mod 12), 29·37 (not = 15 mod 28), 29·53 (not = 15 mod 28), 29·61 (not = 15 mod 28), 37·53 (not = 19 mod 36). So that does not advance matters much! 2p will not work (at least with h = (p+1)/2) because we cannot have 2p = (p+1)/2 mod p-1. So we try looking at 2pq. This requires that p and q = 3 mod 4. So searching for suitable p we find 6 mod 11, 10 mod 19, 22 mod 43, 30 mod 59, 34 mod 67, 42 mod 83. So we look at 2·11·43 = 946, which works. Proving that it is unique is harder. The easiest way is to use a computer to search (approx 5 min to write a Maple program or similar and a few seconds to run it). 9th APMO 1997 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 11 Apr 2002"},{"problem":"3.

It is known that if 0 leqslant k leqslant n, then binom{n}{k}=frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}. Let's prove this identity: for this, we will show that n!=binom{n}{k} k!(n-k)!.To do this, we will count the number of permutations of {1, ldots, n} in two different ways. There are n! permutations (n choices for the image of 1, n-1 for the image of 2, etc.). But we can also construct each permutation as follows: we choose {sigma(1), ldots, sigma(k)}, the set of the first k images of sigma (there are binom{n}{k} choices), then we choose an order for these images (k! possibilities), and finally an order for the remaining n-k images ((n-k)! possibilities). Therefore, we have binom{n}{k} k!(n-k)! different permutations, each produced by this method, hence the equality.For counting stories, to show an equality, a sum is interpreted as an exclusive or: if we sum positive integers a_{1}+cdots+a_{k}, we often interpret a_{i} as the number of possibilities for case i, knowing that each case is exclusive and that they cover all possibilities. If we multiply certain quantities, it should be interpreted as a successive or parallel choice of certain quantities.Often, double counting pairs, triplets, or other sets proves particularly effective. It is important to try this even on simple cases, as more elaborate double counting ideas can appear in more complex problems (for example, the C2 2021 is a good example of a problem where double counting ideas appear). To double count pairs, often we look at the first term of the pair fixed, how many second terms are possible, and vice versa, giving two different equalities/inequalities.The exercises in this TD are mostly taken from those of 2019 and 2021, available here: https://maths-olympiques.fr/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PolycopieV1-1.pdf https://maths-olympiques.fr/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Poly-2021-Valbonne.pdf. It is required to do them without calculation, without using the binomial coefficient formula with factorials, in order to try to properly implement the double counting method."},{"problem":"## Task 1 - 070931All four-digit square numbers are to be determined without using the number table, whose first two and last two basic digits are each equal.","solution":"Let x be the first and y the last digit of such a square number z. Then we havez=1000 x+100 x+10 y+y=1100 x+11 y=11(100 x+y)with 1 leq x leq 9 and 0 leq y leq 9.This implies 11 mid z and, since z is a square number and 11 is a prime number, even 11^2 mid z. Therefore, 11 mid 100 x+y must hold. However, 100 x+y=99 x+x+y, and thus 11 mid x+y.Due to the restrictions on x and y, only 1 leq x+y leq 18 and thus x+y=11 is possible.This implies 100 x+y=99 x+x+y=11(9 x+1) and thus z=11^2(9 x+1).Since z is a square number, 9 x+1 must also be a square number. Given 1 leq x leq 9, this is (as can be determined, for example, by calculating the numbers 9 x+1 for x=1, ldots, 9) only the case for x=7.Conversely, x=7 indeed leads to 9 cdot 7+1=64, resulting in the square number z=121 cdot 64=7744=88^2. This is thus the only four-digit square number with the required conditions.## Solution adopted from [5]"},{"problem":"Given the function f(x) = frac{m}{x} - m + ln x (where m is a constant).1.

In this case, the monotonically increasing interval of the function f(x) is (0, +infty), and there is no monotonically decreasing interval.   When m > 0, by solving f'(x) > 0, we get x > m, and by solving f'(x)  0, f(x) is decreasing on (0, m) and increasing on (m, +infty). The minimum value of f(x) is f(m) = 1 - m + ln m = 0.

The first of the unlucky ones (excluding Nikolai Nikolaevich) to approach the table is the one whose seat is taken by Nikolai Nikolaevich (another unlucky one would sit in their still free seat, which contradicts their unluckiness). He takes the seat of the next (clockwise) unlucky jury member. The second of the unlucky ones to approach is the one whose seat is taken by the first unlucky one (for the same reason), and so on. Thus, each unlucky one sits in the next \\"unlucky\\" seat after their own.Therefore, the seating arrangement is uniquely determined by the division of the jury into lucky and unlucky members. Nikolai Nikolaevich and the one whose seat he took are always unlucky. Any subset of the jury members, not including these two, can be the set of lucky ones. Such a seating arrangement can be implemented, for example, as follows: after Nikolai Nikolaevich, all those we have chosen as lucky (in any order) enter, and then all the others in the order of their seating around the table clockwise.

Conversely, if a^{2} equiv 1(bmod n), for any integers a, b satisfying (a, n)=(b, n)=1, from a equiv b(bmod n) we get a b equiv a^{2} equiv 1(bmod n); from a b equiv 1(bmod n) we get a^{2} equiv 1 equiv b^{2}(bmod n).

Since 4AB = (A + B)^2 - (A - B)^2 = 1007^2 - (A - B)^2, to achieve the maximum value of the area AB, we need to choose A and B so that their difference is as small as possible.

Since the asymptote of the hyperbola passes through the point (3, 6), we can find its equation. As asymptotes of hyperbolas are straight lines, we can use the point-slope form to find its equation. Given that hyperbola's asymptotes have the form y = pm frac{b}{a}x, comparing with the point-slope form y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), we get the slope m = frac{b}{a}. Now we can find the slope using the given point (3, 6): m = frac{6 - 0}{3 - 0} = 2. Hence, the equation of the asymptote is y = 2x.2. The center and radius of the given circle are (2, 0) and 4, respectively.3. To find the length of the chord that the asymptote forms with the circle, we can use the property that the perpendicular distance from the circle's center to the chord equals the square root of the power of the point (the square of the radius minus the square of the distance from the center to the asymptote line).4.

The solutions essentially used the fact that in quadrilaterals with perpendicular diagonals, the sum of the squares of the lengths of opposite side pairs is the same. (If the sides are a, b, c, d in this order, then a^{2}+c^{2}=b^{2}+d^{2}.) From this relationship, they calculated the fourth side.To ensure that the diagonals are perpendicular based on the relationship, it must also be shown that the a^{2}+c^{2}=b^{2}+d^{2} relationship implies the perpendicularity of the diagonals. Let A, B, C, D be the vertices of the quadrilateral and let A C be one of the diagonals. Let the feet of the perpendiculars from B and D to this diagonal be P and Q, respectively, such that P is closer to A. Let |A P|=x, |P Q|=z, and |Q B|=y. Let the distances from the feet to the corresponding vertices be u and v. Then, by the Pythagorean theorem, the sums of the squares of the lengths of the opposite side pairs are x^{2}+u^{2} and y^{2}+v^{2}, and (x+z)^{2}+v^{2} and (z+y)^{2}+u^{2}. Thus, we get the equationleft(x^{2}+u^{2}right)+left(y^{2}+v^{2}right)=left((x+z)^{2}+v^{2}right)+left((z+y)^{2}+u^{2}right)From this, 0=2 z(x+y)+2 z^{2} follows. Hence, z=0, meaning the two feet of the perpendiculars coincide, so the two diagonals are perpendicular to each other.2. It is easily verifiable that the above reasoning is applicable even in the case of a concave quadrilateral.3. The side d opposite the sought side could theoretically be any of a, b, c. Due to symmetry, this could give three solutions. For example, if a is opposite, then d^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}-a^{2}. This must be positive because d^{2}>0. The expression b^{2}+c^{2}-a^{2} is definitely positive unless a>b, c. In this case, it is also positive if a^{2}<b^{2}+c^{2}. This means that a^{2}, b^{2}, c^{2} could be the sides of a triangle.

Find:(1) The radius R of the circumcircle of triangle triangle ABC;(2) The range of values for the radius r of the incircle of triangle triangle ABC.","solution":" Solution:# Part (1): Finding the radius R of the circumcircle1. Using the Law of Sines and given equation:Given frac{a+b}{c} = frac{sin A - sin C}{sin A - sin B}, we can use the Law of Sines, which states frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C} = 2R, where R is the radius of the circumcircle. 2. Transforming the given equation:Given equation can be transformed as frac{a+b}{c} = frac{sin A - sin C}{sin A - sin B} = frac{a-c}{a-b}. This implies that b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - ac.3. Applying the Law of Cosines:By the Law of Cosines, we have b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2accos B. Comparing this with the above equation, we get cos B = frac{1}{2}. Since B in (0, pi), we deduce B = frac{pi}{3}.4. Finding R using the Law of Sines:Using the Law of Sines, 2R = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{7}{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} = frac{14sqrt{3}}{3}. Thus, R = frac{7sqrt{3}}{3}.boxed{R = frac{7sqrt{3}}{3}}# Part (2): Finding the range of values for the radius r of the incircle1. Using the equation from Part (1):From a^2 + c^2 - ac = 49, we get (a+c)^2 = 49 + 3ac.2. Relating the area of triangle ABC to r:The area S_{triangle ABC} = frac{1}{2}acsin B = frac{1}{2}(a+b+c) cdot r. 3. Expressing r in terms of a and c:Thus, r = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} times frac{ac}{7+a+c} = frac{1}{2sqrt{3}} times frac{(a+c)^2 - 49}{7+a+c} = frac{1}{2sqrt{3}}(a+c-7).4. Using the Law of Sines to express a and c:From the Law of Sines, we have a = frac{14sqrt{3}}{3}sin A and c = frac{14sqrt{3}}{3}sin C.5. Finding a+c in terms of A:Thus, a+c = frac{14sqrt{3}}{3}(sin A + sin(frac{2pi}{3} - A)) = 14(sin A cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + cos A cdot frac{1}{2}) = 14sin(A + frac{pi}{6}).6. Determining the range of A+frac{pi}{6}:Since A in (0, frac{2pi}{3}), A+frac{pi}{6} in (frac{pi}{6}, frac{5pi}{6}), which implies sin(A+frac{pi}{6}) in (frac{1}{2}, 1].7.

Since B={2,3,4}, the elements in U but not in B are {1,5}. Therefore, complement_{U}B={1,5}.3. Find the Intersection of Set A and complement_{U}B: The intersection of sets A and complement_{U}B includes all elements that are both in A and in complement_{U}B. Since A={1,3} and complement_{U}B={1,5}, the only common element between these two sets is 1. Therefore, Acap (complement_{U}B)={1}.4.

(by using the hide tags of course.. I don't literally mean that you should hide it :ninja: )","solution":"1. We start by analyzing the given expression (2^2 + p^2 + q^2) and determining the conditions under which it is prime. Note that (2^2 = 4), so the expression simplifies to (4 + p^2 + q^2).2. Consider the parity of (p) and (q). If both (p) and (q) are odd, then (p^2) and (q^2) are also odd, and the sum (p^2 + q^2) is even. Adding 4 (which is even) to an even number results in an even number. The only even prime number is 2, but (4 + p^2 + q^2) is greater than 2, so it cannot be prime. Therefore, (p) and (q) cannot both be odd.3. If both (p) and (q) are even, then (p) and (q) must be 2 (since 2 is the only even prime). However, this would make the expression (4 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12), which is not prime. Therefore, (p) and (q) cannot both be even.4. Thus, one of (p) or (q) must be 2, and the other must be an odd prime. Without loss of generality, assume (q = 2) and (p) is an odd prime. The expression then becomes (4 + p^2 + 2^2 = 4 + p^2 + 4 = p^2 + 8).5. We need to check if (p^2 + 8) can be prime for odd primes (p). Consider the form of (p). Any odd prime (p) can be written as (p = 6k pm 1) for some integer (k). Let's analyze (p^2 + 8) for these forms:   - If (p = 6k + 1), then (p^2 = (6k + 1)^2 = 36k^2 + 12k + 1). Thus, (p^2 + 8 = 36k^2 + 12k + 1 + 8 = 36k^2 + 12k + 9 = 3(12k^2 + 4k + 3)). Since (12k^2 + 4k + 3) is an integer, (p^2 + 8) is divisible by 3. For (p^2 + 8) to be prime, it must be equal to 3, but this is not possible since (p^2 + 8 > 3).   - If (p = 6k - 1), then (p^2 = (6k - 1)^2 = 36k^2 - 12k + 1). Thus, (p^2 + 8 = 36k^2 - 12k + 1 + 8 = 36k^2 - 12k + 9 = 3(12k^2 - 4k + 3)). Similarly, (p^2 + 8) is divisible by 3 and must be equal to 3 to be prime, which is not possible.6. The only remaining odd prime that does not fit the form (6k pm 1) is (p = 3). Check if (p = 3):   - If (p = 3), then (p^2 + 8 = 3^2 + 8 = 9 + 8 = 17), which is prime.7. Therefore, the only solutions are ((p, q) = (3, 2)) and ((p, q) = (2, 3)).The final answer is (boxed{(3, 2) text{ and } (2, 3)})."},{"problem":"5.

We will consider the games that have not been played. The condition means that there will be no three teams that have not played against each other at all. We will prove by induction on k that for 2k teams, the maximum number of unplayed games is no more than k^2.Base case: k=1 (the estimate is obvious).Inductive step: Suppose it is proven for k, we will prove for k+1. If there are no unplayed games, then everything is proven. Otherwise, select any teams A and B that have not played against each other. Note that the number of unplayed games involving teams A or B is no more than 2k (not counting the game between A and B), because for any team C, at least one of the games AC or BC has been played. Now consider all teams except A and B and apply the inductive hypothesis - among them, no more than k^2 games have not been played. Therefore, the total number of unplayed games is no more than k^2 + (2k + 1) = (k+1)^2, which is what we needed to prove.Substituting k=8 gives that the number of unplayed games is no more than 64, and the total number of possible games is frac{16 cdot 15}{2} = 120, so the number of played games is no less than 120 - 64 = 56.The estimate is achieved if the teams are divided into two equal groups, all matches are played within each group, and no matches are played between the groups."},{"problem":"Sally's salary in 2006 was 37,500.

Therefore:[T_n = sum_{k=1}^n left( frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k} - frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k+1} right)]4. Split the sum:[T_n = sum_{k=1}^n frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k} - sum_{k=1}^n frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k+1}]5. Shift the index in the second sum:[sum_{k=1}^n frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k+1} = sum_{k=2}^{n+1} frac{(-1)^{k-2}}{k}]6. Therefore:[T_n = sum_{k=1}^n frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k} - sum_{k=2}^{n+1} frac{(-1)^{k-2}}{k}]7. Combine the sums:[T_n = sum_{k=1}^n frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k} + frac{(-1)^n}{n+1} - sum_{k=1}^n frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k}]8. Simplify:[T_n = sum_{k=1}^n frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k} + frac{(-1)^n}{n+1} - sum_{k=1}^n frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k} = frac{(-1)^n}{n+1}]9. Recall ( S_n ):[S_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} frac{(-1)^k}{k+1}]10. Therefore:[2S_n = 2 sum_{k=0}^{n-1} frac{(-1)^k}{k+1}]11. Thus:[T_n - 2S_n = frac{(-1)^n}{n+1} - 2 sum_{k=0}^{n-1} frac{(-1)^k}{k+1}] Part (3)We need to find the limit:[lim_{n to infty} T_n]1.

Lower Bound:   Consider the sequence sigma = A cdots A B cdots B C cdots C D cdots D, where each letter appears n times consecutively.    - For f_{AB}(sigma): Each A has n B's to its right. Since there are n A's, f_{AB}(sigma) = n times n = n^2.   - For f_{BC}(sigma): Each B has n C's to its right. Since there are n B's, f_{BC}(sigma) = n times n = n^2.   - For f_{CD}(sigma): Each C has n D's to its right. Since there are n C's, f_{CD}(sigma) = n times n = n^2.   - For f_{DA}(sigma): Each D has no A's to its right. Hence, f_{DA}(sigma) = 0.

This is because in any arrangement of 4 distinct letters, at most 3 of the pairs can be of the form (A, B), (B, C), (C, D), (D, A).   - Since there are 4n letters in total, the number of such 4-letter subsequences is binom{4n}{4}.   - However, we are interested in the total number of good pairs, not just in 4-letter subsequences. Each good pair (A, B), (B, C), (C, D), (D, A) can be counted multiple times in different subsequences.   To simplify, consider the total number of ways to select pairs (A, B), (B, C), (C, D), (D, A):   - For each A, there are n B's, so there are n^2 pairs (A, B).   - Similarly, there are n^2 pairs (B, C) and n^2 pairs (C, D).   - For pairs (D, A), each D can pair with n A's, so there are n^2 pairs (D, A).   Therefore, the total number of good pairs is n^2 + n^2 + n^2 + n^2 = 4n^2.   However, since each good pair (A, B), (B, C), (C, D), (D, A) can be counted multiple times in different subsequences, we need to consider the maximum possible sum of f_{AB}(sigma) + f_{BC}(sigma) + f_{CD}(sigma) + f_{DA}(sigma).

We prove that n_{text {max }}=5.For each question, the answers of 16 students form a sequence of length 16, containing only 1, 2, 3, 4 (answer codes). Arrange the sequences corresponding to n questions into an n times 16 number table.Notice the condition \\"any two people have at most one question with the same answer.\\" We can calculate the pairs of identical answers in each question (each row). For convenience in describing the problem, for each row, if two answer codes are the same, we connect these two numbers with a line segment, called a same-color line segment. Suppose a certain row has x 1s, y 2s, z 3s, and t 4s, where x+y+z+t=16, then the row has mathrm{C}_{x}^{2}+mathrm{C}_{y}^{2}+mathrm{C}_{z}^{2}+mathrm{C}_{t}^{2} geqslant mathrm{C}_{4}^{2}+mathrm{C}_{4}^{2}+mathrm{C}_{4}^{2}+mathrm{C}_{4}^{2}=24 (segments) of same-color line segments. Thus, n rows have at least 24n same-color line segments. According to the problem, any two same-color line segments in the n rows have different projections, so 24n leqslant mathrm{C}_{16}^{2}=120, hence n leqslant 5.If n=5, then all the inequalities hold as equalities, so the number table that meets the conditions should satisfy the following two points: square(1) Each row has 4 1s, 4 2s, 4 3s, and 4 4s;(2) Different same-color line segments do not overlap in the n rows.Assume the first row is 1111 quad 2222 quad 3333 quad 4444 (considered as 4 groups), then each group in the other rows is a permutation of 1234 (because same-color line segments do not overlap). A natural permutation is 1234, and we can fill in as many 1234s as possible in the table. It can be found that the corresponding groups in the second row can all be filled with 1234, and the first group (the first 4 columns) can all be filled with 1234 except for the first row. Continuing this way, we can obtain the following number table that meets the conditions, which shows that n=5 is possible.begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}hline begin{tabular}{c} Question Numberend{tabular} & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 hline 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 3 & 3 & 4 & 4 & 4 & 4 hline 2 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 hline 3 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 4 & 3 hline 4 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 2 & 1 & 4 & 3 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 hline 5 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 4 & 3 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 hlineend{tabular}"},{"problem":"12.323.

We observe the sequence ((m_i, n_i)) modulo 17:   [   (1, 1) rightarrow (7, 5) rightarrow (7, 12) rightarrow (1, -1) rightarrow (-1, -1) rightarrow (-7, 12) rightarrow (-7, 5) rightarrow (-1, 1) rightarrow (1, 1) rightarrow dots   ]   This sequence does not provide direct information about (n) modulo 17.7. We use the equation ((2n-1)(2n+1) = 4n^2 - 1 = 11k^2). Since (2n-1) and (2n+1) are positive, we consider two cases:   [   begin{cases}   2n-1 = 11u^2    2n+1 = v^2   end{cases}   quad text{or} quad   begin{cases}   2n+1 = 11u^2    2n-1 = v^2   end{cases}   ]8. For the first case, (11u^2 + 2 = v^2), which is a contradiction since (left(frac{2}{11}right) = -1).9. For the second case, (2n-1 = v^2) and (2n+1 = 11u^2). This implies (n equiv 5 pmod{11}). Hence, (j equiv 2, 11 pmod{12}), or (j equiv 2, 3 pmod{4}). This leads to (n equiv pm 5 pmod{17}).10. We need to prove that (n equiv -5 pmod{17}) is impossible. If (n equiv -5 pmod{17}), then (v^2 = 2n - 1 equiv 6 pmod{17}). However, (left(frac{6}{17}right) = -1), which is a contradiction.Therefore, the only possible residue is (n equiv 5 pmod{17}).The final answer is (boxed{5})"},{"problem":"A large urn contains 100 balls, of which 36 % are red and the rest are blue.

To isolate x, we divide both sides of the inequality by 2, which is the coefficient of x:[frac{2x}{2} leqslant frac{-1}{2}]This simplifies to:[x leqslant -frac{1}{2}]Therefore, the range of values for x is all real numbers less than or equal to -frac{1}{2}. So, the final answer is encapsulated as:[boxed{x leqslant -frac{1}{2}}]"},{"problem":"a,b,c are positive numbers such that  a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2abc + 1 . Find the maximum value of[ (a-2bc)(b-2ca)(c-2ab) ]","solution":"1. Given the equation (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2abc + 1), we need to find the maximum value of ((a-2bc)(b-2ca)(c-2ab)).2. We start by noting that since (a, b, c) are positive numbers, the expression ((a-2bc)(b-2ca)(c-2ab)) must be positive for the maximum value to be positive. Without loss of generality, assume (a ge b ge c).3. First, consider the case where (a le 2bc). In this scenario, we have:   [   c le b le a le 2bc le 2ca le 2ab   ]   This implies:   [   (a - 2bc)(b - 2ca)(c - 2ab) le 0   ]   Therefore, we can assume (a > 2bc).4. Next, we analyze the condition given by the problem:   [   (c - ab)^2 = (a^2 - 1)(b^2 - 1) ge 0   ]   This implies that ((a-1)) and ((b-1)) have the same sign, and so does ((c-1)). We need to consider two cases: (a, b, c > 1) and (a, b, c le 1).5. If (a, b, c > 1), then:   [   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 2abc - 1 ge a^2 + 2bc - 2abc - 1 = (a - 1)(a + 1 - 2bc) > 0   ]   This leads to a contradiction. Therefore, we must have (a, b, c le 1).6. Now, consider the expression:   [   (b - 2ca)(c - 2ab) = bc + 4a^2bc - 2a(b^2 + c^2)   ]   Using the given condition (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2abc + 1), we can rewrite it as:   [   bc + 4a^2bc - 2a(2abc + 1 - a^2) = bc + 2a^3 - 2a   ]7. Applying the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality, we get:   [   frac{1}{2}(a - 2bc) cdot 2(b - 2ca)(c - 2ab) = frac{1}{2}(a - 2bc)(2bc + 4a^3 - 4a)   ]   [   le frac{1}{2} left( frac{a - 2bc + 2bc + 4a^3 - 4a}{2} right)^2 = frac{1}{8}(4a^3 - 3a)^2   ]8. Since (a le 1), it follows that:   [   |4a^3 - 3a| le 1   ]   Therefore:   [   (a - 2bc)(b - 2ca)(c - 2ab) le frac{1}{8}(4a^3 - 3a)^2 le frac{1}{8}   ]9. When (a = 1), (b = c = frac{1}{2}), the expression equals (frac{1}{8}). Thus, the maximum value is (frac{1}{8}).The final answer is (boxed{frac{1}{8}})."},{"problem":"Construct a figure with six adjacent equilateral triangles, the first with a side length of 1 mathrm{~cm} and the following triangles with a side equal to half the side length of the previous triangle, as indicated in the given figure.

Each of them is either 1 or -1. Let S be their sum. Suppose there do not exist 10 consecutive numbers on the circle such that their sum is 0.

Between two successive packets, which have nine elements in common, the difference in the sum is either 0 (if the last element is the same in each) or 2 (if the last element differs). Thus, if we have a strictly positive sum of ten numbers, and a strictly negative one, moving from one to the other step by step on the circle, we add or subtract 2 each time. Since the sums are even integers, and we change the sign, we must necessarily pass through 0, which is a contradiction. Therefore, all sums of 10 consecutive numbers have the same sign.If they are all positive, they are at least 2. In 10 consecutive numbers, there are therefore at least six 1s, so there are two consecutive 1s. Let's take two consecutive 1s on the circle. By considering the 201 disjoint consecutive sums formed by the other 2010 numbers, we see that S geqslant 402 + 2 = 404. We can find a configuration where S = 404: we place six 1s followed by four -1s, then again six 1s and four -1s, until we have 2010 numbers. Then we add two 1s to conclude. The total sum is 6 times 201 - 4 times 201 + 2 = 404, and we cannot have more than four -1s in ten consecutive numbers, so all sums of ten such numbers are strictly positive. By changing each -1 to 1 one by one, S takes on all even values between 404 and 2012 (without decreasing the sums of ten consecutive integers). Thus, we can achieve any even sum between 404 and 2012, inclusive, and that's all (S is 2012 minus twice the number of -1s, so S is even and bounded by 2012).Similarly, the achievable negative sums are the even integers between -404 and -2012."},{"problem":"The result of factoring the polynomial 3ax^{2}-3ay^{2} is:A: 3a(x^{2}-y^{2})B: 3aleft(x-yright)left(x+yright)C: 3aleft(y-xright)left(y+xright)D: 3aleft(x-yright)^{2}","solution":"To factor the polynomial 3ax^{2}-3ay^{2}, we follow these steps:1.

Adding frac{1}{2} to these inequalities, we find:[frac{1}{2} < f(x) < frac{5}{2}]Thus, the range of f(x) is (frac{1}{2}, frac{5}{2}), not (-frac{1}{2}, +infty).

Given that there is initially 1 red ball and n black balls are added, the total number of balls becomes 1+n. The probability of drawing a red ball, p, is therefore the ratio of red balls to the total number of balls, which is frac{1}{1+n}.Step 1: Calculating E(xi)The expected value E(xi) for a binomial distribution B(1, p) is given by E(xi) = p.

The function y = 4x - x^2 can be rewritten as y = -(x^2 - 4x) and completing the square gives us y = -(x-2)^2, which is clearly symmetric about x=2 as well.Since both functions are symmetric about x=2, and one is decreasing while the other increasing, they will intersect at two points which are symmetrically located around x=2.

Understanding the Problem:   - Each subset must have at least 2004 elements.   - The intersection of any two distinct subsets must have exactly 2004 elements.2. Considering Subsets with 2006 Elements:   - If a subset has 2006 elements, it is the entire set ( A ).   - There can be at most one such subset because any other subset would have to intersect with it in all 2006 elements, which contradicts the requirement of having exactly 2004 elements in the intersection.3. Considering Subsets with 2005 Elements:   - Let’s denote a subset with 2005 elements as ( S ).   - If ( S ) is missing one element from ( A ), say ( a ), then ( S = A setminus {a} ).   - Any other subset ( T ) with 2005 elements must miss a different element, say ( b ), so ( T = A setminus {b} ).   - The intersection ( S cap T ) will be ( A setminus {a, b} ), which has exactly 2004 elements.   - There are 2006 such subsets, each missing a different element from ( A ).4. Considering Subsets with 2004 Elements:   - Let’s denote a subset with 2004 elements as ( U ).   - If ( U ) is missing two elements from ( A ), say ( a ) and ( b ), then ( U = A setminus {a, b} ).   - Any other subset ( V ) with 2004 elements must miss a different pair of elements, say ( c ) and ( d ), so ( V = A setminus {c, d} ).   - The intersection ( U cap V ) will be ( A setminus {a, b, c, d} ), which has 2002 elements, not 2004.   - Therefore, subsets with 2004 elements cannot be used.5. Conclusion:   - The maximal number of subsets of ( A ) such that the intersection of any two distinct subsets has exactly 2004 elements is achieved by considering subsets with 2005 elements.   - There are 2006 such subsets, each missing a different element from ( A ).The final answer is (boxed{2006})."},{"problem":"In the expansion of (3+x)^5+(2-x)^6, the binomial coefficient of the term containing x^4 is the term of the sequence {a_n} with the general term a_n=2n+2.
