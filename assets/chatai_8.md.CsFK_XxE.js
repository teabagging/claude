I was warned that I      will have sore gums, excess saliva and a speech impediment (lisp) – thankfully none of those have occurred. My problem is that within 2 hours of putting them in every morning they become very loose to the point where they lift out of place completely and continually through out the day. Apart from the overwhelming embarrassment (I work in a library this has happened endless times whist talking to a customer) I have also bit into the denture with my remaining teeth especially when eating – how I haven't broken the plate or my remaining teeth I don't know! Also as extreme as the next two examples may sound they are true - whist eating I have almost swallowed them , thankfully they do not fit down my throat but have cut into the roof of my mouth at the back and because they were on there side it took what felt like ages and a complete panic attack thinking I was going to choke to death! The      other excruciating thing is on several occasions whilst kissing my boyfriend they have come loose entering his mouth – I no longer indulge in such normal behaviour which is having a detrimental effect on my relationship. I have told my dentist who initially said if I have problems to return and he will adjust them – unfortunately on returning he said this is normal there is nothing more he can do as due to my gum recession it's the best fit they will ever be. So my question is, is this normal? I know      quite a few people with partial dentures (also due to gum recession/disease ) and they have had no such problems. My sister has had practically identical treatment  - she is 5 weeks into her partial denture and has had no such problems in fact she can't believe how well they fit!As you can imagine my confidence is at an all time low effecting my work life and personal life and more importantly I have lost 4lb since I have had them fitted – I am slim enough I CAN NOT afford to loose ANY weight!  I have used denture adhesive this lasts all of 3hrs yet during those 3 hrs they still slip around and form a kind of see saw effect lifting on either side depending on which side I'm attempting to eat on.I would really appreciate some honest advice regarding this matter.Kind Regards,Miss Angela Earley","Doctor":"hello miss angela...read thru ur query...the situation udescribed is quite natural and it is one of the defects of lower removable denture...this lower denture has to be worn regularly as ur well aware nothing can perfectly replace what is given naturally...so thru practice the muscles around ur denture get adjusted with this new members in ur oral cavity....1st few weeks its disturbing as u said..but take my word after 3-4 weeks of regular wear ur muscles will be adjusted and it will fit like anything..(wear REGULARLY)..be happy practise makes a man perfect.it applies in this situation..go to ur dentist and tell him to adjust the metal parts (Clasps) to be tightened if at all it is there...be happy...hope ur benefitted something from this reply..have a healthy day!!!"},{"Patient":"Age - 22.

What is going on?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCMi have gone through your query.Sore throats commonly caused by a viral infection but bacterial infection may also cause a sore throat like :Strep throat, which usually does not occur with congestion or a cough.An inflammation or infection of the tonsils (tonsillitis) and sometimes the adenoids (adenoiditis).An infection of the tissues around the tonsils (peritonsillar abscess).Inflammation of the epiglottis (epiglottitis).The treatment for a sore throat depends on the cause as for a sore throat caused by viral infection you don't need to take antibiotics but for bacterial infection you do.However, you can treat many sore throats at home.~ gargling with warm salt water~ drinking plenty of warm fluids, such as teas, soup, and water~ avoiding allergens and irritants, such as smoke and chemicals~ taking throat lozenges~ reducing inflammation with ibuprofen or acetaminophen (paracetamol)if the symptom persist then you should visit a doctor.Hope this answers your query.RegardsDr. Shesh"},{"Patient":"Hello, I got braces approximately a year ago.

Who would be the best specialist to see about the chest pain?","Doctor":"hello ,thank you for your question at healthcare magic.There is less chances of corelation between your taking antibiotics and recurrence of costochondritis .But the reason for infection in your tooth need to be diagnosed and treated properly.Because there are many chances that recurrence of costochondritis is due to heavy tooth infection.Because there are microoragnisms present in infection which in turn are affecting intercostal cartilage and causing inflamation of it.Which present to you as symptoms of costochondritis.So you need to get reason of that infection diagnosed and treated by nearby dentist.And please go as soon as possible.Beacuse if any dental treatment is necessary then that can be performed between 12th to 24th week of pregnancy only as it is the safe period for mother and baby.For treatment of costochondritis you need to consult Tuberculosis and chest specialist doctor.You can reconsult for any further queries.wish you and baby happy health."},{"Patient":"my graddaughter has been told by Shriners.She needs to have surgery.She has had two different braces.With no good results.She is on 11yrs. old fully developed.Looks like she is 13.I am worried for her.At this age.

In the past few weeks I have went through a lot with my teeth. My orthodontist told me that before I got braces I would need to get four teeth pulled. I went to the dentist and he claimed that my roots were too deep and I would need to go to an oral surgeon. However, once they were pulled the oral surgeon said it was some of the easiest extractions he had ever done and my roots weren t deep at all and that any general dentist could have done them. But my dentist did claim that I had 7 cavities, even though I brush my teeth twice a day and floss and am going to school to be a dental hygienist. I took his word for it though and paid him to fill the cavities that only he could see. After he had filled them he told me that he may have went a little too deep on one cavity and hit a nerve. Well two weeks later the nerve is infected and nothing can go into my mouth without me screaming in pain. Well, thats how it was at first anyways. It has gotten better because I went to the emergency room and they gave me antibiotic. I m pretty sure I will need to get a root canal.

What is the cause for the swelling?","Doctor":"Dear sir/Mam,        I understand your problem.Every tooth has three layers .The third innermost layer has nerves and blood vessels.when the tooth decay is progressing in first two layers we will not have pain since they dont have nerves.When the decay enters the third layer , it damages the  nerve and blood vessels.These decayed tissues will develop pus.This infectious pus will not have enough space inside the root canal.so it spreads up through the root tip by resorbing bone.Thus there  will be bone resorption and pus collection around the root tip.Thats why you feel loose and painful when you chew something since you increase the pressure inside the pus collection.when the pressure from pus collection keeps on increasing , it will keep resorbing the surrounding bone and comes out as swelling of cheek.so permanent solution for this condition is to clean the pus filled tooth with root canal treatment.If you are not affordable at this time atleast take some antibiotics like cefixime 200mg twice daily for 5 days to control the pus collection.But this problem should be taken care of before 6 months(maximum) to prevent loss of tooth and bone structure.Hope your query is answered.please dont hesitate to contact back for further queries."},{"Patient":"i have bumps on the inside of my bottom lip, small painful bumps on my tounge (which look like inflamed tastebuds) and a small open sore on the inside of my bottom lip which is very small, white on the outside and red on the inside.. is this because of my braces?","Doctor":"HiThanks for writing in.Yes it could be due to trauma due to your braces or traumatic bite.Secondly it could be due taking some extremely hot thing causing thermal injury.You may apply some anesthetic gel for temporary relief.RegardsDr. Neha Sumra"},{"Patient":"Hello, I had an right upper molar removed yesterday, n immdediately after extraction i felt like my cheek has swollen hugely and its still same today :(.

But to prevent chipping of root canal treated tooth its always advisable to get a cap or crown for it.since your tooth hole is opened for a long time without a filling or crown ,adjacent gum tissue would have grown into it , becoming red as you chew food particles on it.In rare case, the filling material even from root would have come out and the remnant pulpal tissue would have developed into a pulpal polyp ( painless growth of pupal tissue) .Whatever the reason for the growing tissue , its absolutely treatable.you may need a re- RCT if its pupal polyp or else just cut the gum tissue growth ( painless with lasers)and fill the tooth.Absolutely nothing to worry.Hope your query is answered.For further queries please dont hesitate to contact back."},{"Patient":"I smoked 8 hours after wisdom teeth extraction.No excessive bleeding or pain.48 have have passed now since the extraction.I smoked one cigarette every day.I didn't suck the smoke too hard.Should i be afraid of dry socket?The stitches seem to be healing well.","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The smoking causes the blood clot dislodgement by creating a negative pressure.

A long time ago, my tooth (left, upper) was impacted due to a bicycle accident. Since then, I observed pus (without pain) in the gum right where the impacted tooth is. Now, I notice a flesh has grown that looks like a skin tag on that part of the gum.

As a first line of treatment cut the tissue tag , clean that area and take antibiotics.If it recurs,take an X-ray to check whether there is any possibility of the tooth to erupt by its own.If not try orthodontic eruption(braces) of tooth.If nothing is possible last line of treatment is the removal of that problematic tooth.Hope your query is answered.For further queries please dont hesitate to contact back.Thank you."},{"Patient":"I'm a 17 year old female going to college in the fall about 1 1/2 hours away.

He called me in a round of antibiodics and I made a apt for the root canal a week out, however the pain got so bad I didn t last until the scheduled apt, bad enough where it was waking me up out of my sleep, had me in tears. so he called me in a stronger antibiodic and he moved up my apt for the root canal, performed it this last Thursday. Said the tooth was infected and I had a lot of imflammation and it bled a lot during the root canal. He did the root canal right thru my permanent crown.

A couple of routine tests were asked to be taken which are OPG - Digital, CBC, RBS, BT, CT and PT. After examination they formulated a treatment plan which includes -Scaling and polishing- Lower arch - Dental implants under local anesthesia, with or without adrenaline 1 is to 80000- Upper complete dentureThe following medication would be givenCap Phexin 250 mgTab EnzoflamWe have also provided them a brief medical history of my mother which includes her medical condition known as Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy, from what we understand from her symptoms for which is taking Tegretol, 200 to max 400 mg day. As per observation her seizure occurrence has been 2 seizures a day that occur every 15th or 16th day or at times an episode of seizure if highly stressed or unwell or traveling bound.We are satisfied with the treatment plan provided by this dental clinic. Now since she has this specific epilepsy condition that I mentioned above, we have been asked to get her family doctor or the doctor under whom she may be getting treatment for epilepsy to provide CONSENT letter about her general health so as to proceed with the dental treatment without any further complications.As such she does not have any specific doctor that has been treating for her for this condition and perhaps as suggested by some doctor in her late 20's she was recommended Dilantin, and then later on Mazetol and for last several years she is taking Tegretol which has pretty much kept her seizures in control. Although she has never been seizure free for a consistent period of time in spite of regular use of these medication, but to a large extent it is the only support system for her.

I am inquiring about a mouth problem. About 3 years ago i had all my teeth removed at one sitting. they put me under in order to do it. My teeth were in pretty bad shape, and the infection was kicking me down in the dirt. After the stitches heals i got fitted for false teeth. After several attempts of them trying to get the bottoms to fit without hurting or gagging me, i gave up. So for about 3 years now i have not had any teeth on the bottom of my mouth. Here in the last week, i have noticed a tenderness in my lower gums. Now it feels like it did when i had a mouth full of rotten teeth. I looked in the spot that hurts and there is something exposed, the gum has pulled back about 1/4 long and 1/8 wide to expose something underneath that is off white around the edge and an ugly dark yellow in the middle. My question to you, and i understand that your not going to diagnose me, but help me revile  the extent of my troubles maybe. I plan to make an appointment soon, but we have a deadline on this job. Anyways, could it be that my jawbone is being exposed due to no protection (lower dentures) or that maybe the dentist missed a tooth?","Doctor":"Hello,You have the possibility of a retained root being exposed. This may feel like a splinter in the gum. You may feel a hard structure that has some mobility. Removal by your dentist should be a simple procedure and offer relief. Use of a benzocaine gel may offer tempoaray relief. Rinse the area well with warm salt water and take some anti-inflammatory medication such as Tylenol or Advil.Another possibility is trauma that has caused tissue damage that is now infected. An ulcerated lesion may heal by itself. Avoid all irritants including smoking, alcohol, spicy and acidic foods. Again, warm salt water rinses and antinflammatory medications may offer relief. Antibiotics or anti fungal treatment may be needed if there is a bacterial, viral or fungal infection present. Make sure that you consult your dentist if the area does not improve with the suggested methods or increases in discomfort.Continue to monitor the area. There is a possibility of a systemic disease or lesion that needs further evaluation such as a biopsy. Your dentist will perform a clinical evaluation and recommend treatment for your condition. An xray evaluation can show any changes in the bone.Make sure to keep well hydrated. Take vitamins and avoid deficiencies with a well balanced diet. A softer diet is recommended until the area heals. Inspect your denture for buildup or signs of wear. An illfitting denture may irritate tissue and make you prone to a fungal infection. Overall gum discomfort with redness may be an oral yeast infection and require nystatin medication.Thank you for your inquiry. I hope your discomfort will decrease with my recommendations. I am glad to assist you further."},{"Patient":"I was on Levaquin ti fight an infection and then a dentist ewmoved an infected tooth.  I have upper stomach pain which reaches an unbearable level when a short period passes after I eat.  Once I eat it subsides for awhile.

Drink plenty of water with this medication. Avoid taking an antacid with a two hour period of taking this medication. Report your difficulty to your dentist. A different antibiotic may be prescribed. I usually prescribe amoxicillin 500 mg for infected teeth. Continue to rinse the area and prevent debris from getting into the extraction area. If you have delayed healing, your dentist may need to clean out the socket  place a medicated paste into the extraction socket. Try switching to Tylenol for pain relief. This may be kinder to your stomach than the ibuprofen.Avoid irritants such as acidic and spicy foods.

I am currently on Boniva, Lipitor, Furosemide, one-a-day women, Calcium-D, Ginkgo Biloba,  ??","Doctor":"Hello,Your medications most likey have the side effect of a dry mouth. You must keep well hydrated and rinse your mouth often. There are dental products including toothpaste, rinses, sprays ang gum designed for patients with zerostomia. Chewing sugar free gum with xylitol can stimulate saliva flow. Avoid irritants such as smoking and alcohol that will dry out the mouth. Limit high sugar content foods and acidic foods. Your mouth may have a thicker plaque and require greater attention to your daily oral hygiene to avoid an increase in decay at the gum line. Protect your teeth with additional flouride such as a rinse along with flouride in your toothpaste. See if a change in medication or combination of medication can help your saliva flow. Breathing through your mouth will contribute to lip dryness. Rule out any other medical conditions affecting saliva flow. Make sure your dental exam does not indicate any dental conditions that need attention. If you are missing back teeth and your bite has collapsed, you may have salvia leak out at the corners of your mouth and contribute to cracking of th lips. Keep your lips moist by using moisturizing balms. Do not over use the Orabase ointment. Continue with vitamin B-12. Rule out any deficiencies and maintain a proper diet.Thank you for your inquiry.

Try to figure out what triggered this reaction. Possiilities include an allergic reation to food or liquids, a reaction to a new dental or cosmetic product, medications and exposure to chemicals, plants or a bug bite. Remove any irritants and stop using any new products. Think of dietary changes that may contribute. Stay well hydrated.Any severe change in your condition especially with an increase in swelling will require the care of a professional. Check your teeth for any signs of infection. Is there swelling close to a particular tooth? Pain, hot or pressure sensitivity? Ths may indicate an active infection and will require an antibiotic. See your dentist for a diagnosis and treatment recommendations. Keep taking anti-inflammatory medication. Tylenol and Motrin are additional medications to help limit the discomfort from inflammation. Some viral, bacterial or fungal infections may cause changes in your tissue that can be accompanied with swelling.

I don't have any pain, but my mouth does feel, well, weird. I've never had any dental work before, so I don't really know what to expect. When I bite down, there's an odd pressure on the spot where my tooth was pulled, like the bridge is being pressed more firmly into my gum line. Is that just because it's still healing? Should I give it a little more time, or should I go back to my dentist? I thought the bridge was supposed to be firmly set, but I'm assuming my gums are still swollen from yesterday's tooth extraction, too. They do seem a little bruised around the bridge site.

Yes, Javex will kill the nerve. Somtimes a bleach compound is carefully used by a dentist to disinfect the canal system of a tooth when having a root canal. Exposure to bleach will cause your tissue to suffer from burns and possibly require a trip to the emergency room. Different formulations of hydrogen peroxide are used to whiten teeth. Your medication is known to affect the saliva flow in your mouth. This can have a detrimental affect on your enamel. Keep up with good daily oral hygiene. Use toothpaste with fluoride and make sure to rinse with fluoride. There are prescription flouride gels and rinses available. Your plaque can have a very thick consistancy and be difficult to remove if you experience a dry mouth. You must increase your daily home care. Avoid acidic foods and liquids high in sugar. Keep well hydrated and follow a good nutrition plan with balanced vitamins. Anti-inflammatory medication such as Tylenol or Motrin will offer pain relief while helping to limit inflammation. Eugenol or cloves can have a soothing affect on a toothache. An exposed nerve will need dental treatment and will be the source of an infection. The infection will spread if left untreated. Usual options include a root canal with a restoration or an extraction. Antibiotics by prescription may be necessary if the tooth is painful and other symptoms such as swelling or pressure sensitivity develop. Emergency treatment can include  being placed on aa antibiotic and putting medication with a temporary filling in the affected tooth.Thank you for your inquiry. I am glad to answer additional questions."},{"Patient":"I'm 19 years old, and I was cutting grass and I didn't have a bump on the roof of my mouth at that time, and I ate some chicken and the next morning my tooth, when I bit down It didn't hurt, but I could feel pressure like it was loose, but it's not loose or anything, well two days later it's inflamed and a little painful, but very very discomforting, I got my mom to look at it to see if it's an abscess, and she said no because their wasn't a spot on it like an abscess would look like, and she said it's just swollen, and inflamed.. It's been two days since it's been there, and I wanna know what it is, I have no fever, no headaches, my teeth don't ache, it's just pressure when I bite down, and don't hurt, I brush my teeth daily, good hygiene, it's just that bump that's sore and painful, I know what an abscess is, I've had two before and had em extracted, and it looks nothing like an abscess period. It's no where near my teeth, or the cracks of my teeth, it's more to the top way above my teeth near the middle of the roof of my mouth, can anyone please help me, on how to get rid of it or something? Can't see a dentist, no insurance and no money to see one, so please someone help me?","Doctor":"Hello and thanks for consulting HCM.i have gone through your query.according to your case it doesnt look like an abscess.its rather an inflammed (sore) palate( roof of mouth). its generally caused by local irritation like:~eating hot and spicy food~irritation from any sharp edged tooth~improper fitting denture~alcohol usein your case hot and spicy food can be the cause.you dont have to worry about much.if i were your treating doctor i would advice you to use a anesthetic gel like oragel, rinse with a good mouthwash thrice daily.avoid hot and n spicy food for that period at least.following this will resolve your condition.Hope this answer helps. take careRegards Dr. Shesh"},{"Patient":"I was told a few months back I would need a root canal. Newly having a job, I ignored this. Now I lost my job due to Celiacs Sprue triggering. And I now have no health insurance. I'm getting pains in my jaw and clicking when opening it. And now random nausea from no where. I'm scared that I won't be able to get this fixed with no insurance. Is there any way I can buy time with no insurance?","Doctor":"Hello,This indicates that you have an active, untreated infection. Antibiotics can help control the spread of the infection and calm down an acute reaction, but treatment needs to follow. If you can not proceed with the root canal and restoration, your other option is to extract the tooth.Immediate relief and some reduction of inflammation may be possible by taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Antibiotics  require a prescription. If your pain is severe, you will need to see a dentist or visit an emergency room. A tooth can have a medicated temporary placed to start to treat the infection. This is the initial stage of a root canal and will give you relief. This will allow some more time to make completing the root canal possible. Do not be fooled into thinking that if it does not hurt, you can continue to delay treatment. Your tooth can decay to a point that it can no longer be restored.Thank you for your inquiry. I hope you will be able to keep the tooth and proceed with a root canal. I am available to answer additional questions."},{"Patient":"Numbness or tingling sensations in the tongue, medically known as paresthesia of the tongue, most commonly occur due to damage to the nervous system. The medical term for the absence of sensation is anesthesia. Damage to the lingual nerve that supplies the tongue has been reported as a complication of dental procedures or surgery such as wisdom tooth extraction, implants, or root canal procedures. Other conditions that damage the nerves, as well as brain conditions such as stroke, can also cause numbness and tingling of the tongue. I have this - I had dental work done about two days ago and the nerve zapped in pain when I had the injection. Will this repair itself, do I need the filling out or is it permenant? If the latter, will it effect speech or taste?","Doctor":"Hello,The injection causing a zapping pain means the needle had direct contact with the nerve. Most cases of paraesthsia from an injection will not cause permanent damage and gradual sensation will return. Concerns are greater with an extraction, oral surgery or implant placement due to actual risk of cutting the nerve in these more invasive procedures. The tingling sensation is a sign that the nerve is responsive and in the process of trying to return to a normal state.Anti-inflammatory medications such as Tylenol or Motrin may assist healing. Try B complex for two weeks. Inflammation can cause pressure on nerves and delay return to normal function. If the  filling was very deep, there is a risk of an infection being present. This will require a return visit to the dentist for an evaluation. Antibiotic medication may be prescribed. Monitor the area around the tooth for swelling, a bubble, pain, hot sensitivity or inability to put pressure on the tooth. Your dentist will advise you if further treatment is needed. I would not expect your filling to be removed unless additional treatment is necessary such as a root canal. Keep your dentist informed of your remaining numbness. Report any changes.Thank you for your inquiry. I am glad to answer additional questions."},{"Patient":"My dentist had me wearing a grind guard which I have for years. He recently did a molar cavity fill for an hour procedure. He said he had never used that much novacaine 2 molars opposite side of mouth before. I was so numb I bit my left cheek when asked me to check the bite. My concern isi now have much main in wisdom tooth area of gums behind molar work and I heard a cracking pop after I ate food today with spoon. Never before had I heard a gum band sound when I opened my mouth. Will this go away? If I keep using my mouth guard & rest my jaw?  Thank you so much for any thoughts.-Michael","Doctor":"Thank you for contacting Healthcare magic. I believe your TMJ is stressed from keeping open for the procedure and amount of injections. You can reduce inflammation with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Try warm compresses and a soft diet. Resting the jaw is the correct procedure to follow. Continue to use your night guard. Keep up with regular dental care and rinse with warm salt water to allow the gum to heal around the teeth. Your jaw should start to feel better and the sound should not continue as the inflammation allows you to return to normal function. Have your dentist check the function of the TMJ and the position of the disc that slides as the joint is in function if you still have discomfort or sounds such as a clicking.Make sure that you feel your bite is not high and that you do not contact the new fillings before other teeth. Please make sure there is not an interference when you slide your teeth together. This will continue to aggrevate your jaw. Call your dentist for an adjustment or if you are unsure about your bite, ask the dentist to check your bite.Keep your dentist informed of any changes. Deep fillings with an increase in sensitivity may need to be monitored for an infection. I hope you will feel better each day and am available to assist you further."},{"Patient":"hello doctor ,i m 24 yrs old.in this month my periods is 10 days delay.and also suffer from white discharge.doctor prescribed me VDM-KIT.m2 tone,or also suggest for thiroid testing..my question is that after taking the vdm kit my periods is start or not??my height is 5.6ft and weight 68kg..","Doctor":"Hi Madhumati, Welcome to HCM.

The body will take care of this with time. Healing may involve some tissue changes and even an area of solid feeling tissue can be part of normal healing. You can  expect a slow healing process that can take 3 to 6 weeks to totally resorb the hematoma. Warm salt water rinses and anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen may assist healing. If the area increases or does not continue to heal, visit the dentist to evaluate if drainage of the hematoma should be considered. In general, this is not considered an unusual event and you do not need to worry. It is a very positive sign that there has been little pain and little swelling. This indicates healing is progressing well.Thank you for your inquiry.

He prescribed cepholexin and some sort of mouth wash. I'm still in pain though. How long should it take for the pain to atleast ease up?","Doctor":"Hello,You have been prescribed an antibiotic to control infection. Make sure to take the antibiotic as prescribed and it may take a full 48 hours for you to have relief from the antibiotic. Contact your dentist to report your continued discomfort. The dentist may need to change the antibiotic if it is not effective. You should discuss which pain relief medication is recommended during your pregnancy with your doctor. Most of my pregnant patients are able to take acetaminophen for pain relief. This can be taken to relieve your immediate discomfort and reduce inflammation, if your doctor agrees.If you will delay an extraction, the tissue around the tooth may need to be cleaned out under local anesthsia. You need to keep the area clean with rinsing and maintaining proper daily dental hygiene. Consider a consultaion with an oral surgeon, if you do not feel relief shortly.Thank you for your inquiry.

I went to the ER and they did a CT and bloodwork.  I was told all was ok and they sent me home with ERY 333 in case there was an underlying infection of some sort.  They did mention a small amount of fluid on L eardrum.  I went ahead and followed up with an eye dr and dentist.  The eye doctor did the exam and dialated my eyes.  He was concerned about Giant cell arteritis and wanted the results of my bloodwork.  I had to go back and have that particular blood test drawn.  The number was a 10 and not 50 or more so he ruled that out.  I then went to my dentist and the xrays showed a possible abcessed root.  Second to last molar on the L side.

I finished my last antibiotic tab today also.","Doctor":"Helloi have read your query.Although having a tooth pulled is usually very safe, the procedure can allow harmful bacteria into the bloodstream. Gum tissue is also at risk of infection. If you have a condition that puts you at high risk for developing a severe infection, you may need to take antibiotics before and after the extraction.It is normal to feel some pain after the anesthesia wears off. For 24 hours after having a tooth pulled, you should also expect some swelling and residual bleeding. However, if either bleeding or pain is still severe more than four hours after your tooth is pulled, you should call your dentist.in your case i think tooth socket is healing. it ll take around 4 weeks to heal completely but if you feel that its still draining you should consult a dentist.hope this ans helpsRegardsDr. Shesh"},{"Patient":"hi there my mother has a hard long white/pink mass growing under her lower left teeth on the outside between her teeth and her cheek, it goes from her front pointed tooth to behind her last molar tooth on her left side, what is the chances of cancer and what is the proceedure at this point to find out what exactly it is?  keep in mind she is scared to death early this week she was loosing her eye sight hearing and numbness to left side of her face","Doctor":"Hello and thanks for consulting HCM.Without seeing the lump to learn its exact location, color, x-ray films, only general observation can be listed.

A biopsy will be taken if the tissue appears suspicious and a pathological study is necessary. Keep watching and monitoring any changes to provide details to your oral surgeon. The greatest concern is to rule out a malignant melanoma which can have a black-blue pigment. Other possibilities include an amalgam tattoo with a blue-grey appearance, a growth of blood vessels or hemangioma appearing dark blue, a bruise from trauma or a lesion with extra melanin.  Some viruses  can cause a discoloration and is a possibility since you mention a recent illness concerning the ear, nose and throat area. Karposi's sarcoma is a cancer seen on the roof of themouth. It has a purple appearance, often with swelling, and is an agressive vascular cancer seen in immune compromised patients. I recommend that you follow the advice of your dentist and make an appointment with the specialist. Continue to practice good oral hygiene. Avoid irritants to the oral cavity.

He was very concerned as he noticed he had calcification of his arteries in his neck. He is going to see a Dr regarding it next week, but just wondered what the treatment is for this sort of thing? He wanted him to go out straight away and get some cartier.","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for your inquiry. I understand your concern and agree that any calcifications in the neck are of great concern. If the carotid artery is suffering from stenosis, there is a risk of less oxygen going to the brain. The diameter of the blood vessel is reduced. A cerebrovascular accident or stroke is possible. Quick action is necessary.Lifestyle changes and medications will be considered. Cholesterol reducing medications and blood thinners are common medications prescribed. If your condition is severe, immediate surgery such as a angioplasty to widen the blood vessel may be needed. A balloon widens the artery and a mesh placed in the artery keeps it open. If a vessel is more accessible, surgery to remove the calcifications can be performed. If your symptoms include severe headaches, dizziness, numbness, speech difficulties, or confusion, this may indicate a greater threat of a stroke and seek immediate care. You are fortunate that your dentist has advised you of this condition and you may be treating the condition before any severe symptoms put you at a greater risk.  Plan to share your MRI with your doctor.Thank you for your inquiry.

I hope you are asking about  gastritis.   gastritis can occur due to many reasons especially in middle-aged due to stress. there is increased acid secretion inside your stomach which causes  high acidity and burning sensation in your stomach.  Other symptoms like  excessive belching, burping, altered bowel habits, altered appetite can also be there.  The specific treatment of gastritis aims at reducing the acid secretion and decreasing the movement of gut. You should visit your doctor and get a specific prescription for this.  Your doctor might advise you an acid reducing medicine like pantoprazole or omeprazole along with domperidone.  This drug helps in reducing the symptoms. you should make a habit of having a glass of water 15 to 20 minutes before your meals.you should take adequate water throughout the day. Please practice yoga or meditation  and proper diet and at regular intervals in small quantities , to get free from gastritis or hyperacidity. Hope this information helps you and others.

Avoid spicy and acidic foods. Keep well hydrated and make sure you do not have any imbalances or vitamin deficiencies. make sure you have adequate vitamin B12. Rinse your mouth with warm salt water multiple times daily. Benadryl, the antihistamine, can be taken to reduce inflammation and offer some reduction of discomfort.If your symptoms worsen, seek immediate medical attention.

I was placed on anti-biotics for bacterial infection, but the next dentist I saw said the former didn't check my bite, which was the problem.  That dentist shaved down the bond, and I left her office in very real pain.  The sensitivity has since decreased, but not completely subsided.  It does not wake me up at night, but I feel it just a few minutes after waking and then throghout the day.  I can't handle this constant pain to my brain, albeit slight.  I am not prepared to go for root canal - i would rather live every day with slight pain than that.  It's been almost two weeks since the bond shaving, but I'm convinced the pain will not go away completely.  If the nerve is agitated, I'm thinking that a re-bonding can't help b/c the nerve will be hit even further b/c it will involve slight further infringement on my tooth enamel, nor do I want to pu the tooth through any more stress in the short term.  CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT IS LIKELY OCCURRING AND WHAT I CAN DO?  My dentist says there should not be any exposed dentin, but I've been using sensitivity toothpaste anyway just in case.

Since the stool examination report shows that the stools are normal it is usrely normal and your baby does not have any problems.Few points to remember are that :- -a child can pass stools as many times as it takes feeding. -if your baby is more than 8 months even teething can give rise to loose motions. -if the baby is treated with any sort of antibiotics then also it can loose motions. Presently if your baby has not lost weight or does not seem to be dehydrated then please don't worry as  the loose motions are normal and they do not need to be treated.Just in case if you still want you can give your baby a probiotic like Nutrolin-B 5 ml twice a day for 5 days and she should be fine.

I also get bad breath because of this white stuff.","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The sticky saliva could be because of the reduced salivary secretion. This can occur if there is any stone in the salivary gland duct. or it can be because of medical conditions like diabetes, sjogrens syndrome, drugs like antihypertensive , antihistamines. Consult a oral physician and get yourself examined to rule out these things and get it diagnosed. Then we can treat accordingly by removing the cause. Mean while you can drink lot of water and you can also use salivary substitutes like wet mouth gel.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"Hi. I've had metal braces put during my teens, though extraction of teeth was kinda required, my parents after discussion with doctor decided against it..I'm 23 now, and my front two teeth, is back to being what it looked like earlier (before metal braces).

Thanks.","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The mal aligned teeth can be corrected by putting braces. Consult a orthodontist and take one more opinion regarding extraction of teeth. If more space is required to align the teeth then you might have to go for extraction of teeth. You have to take radiographs like OPG and lateral cephalogram to decide about extraction. Lingual orthodontics might cost around 60,000 to 1lakh.

I do still have some slight discomfort on that side although I wouldn't call it pain and it is not overally painful to the touch.  I have a follow up appointment this coming Saturday with my oral surgeon but am wondering what this could be and if I should call my regular dentist tomorrow.  I know that this could be bone but it is pretty large and am wondering if it could be anything else.  Any information you could provide would be appreciated.

Right abdominal rigidity can be due to various causes,however since sonography and colonoscopy has come out with negative reports, this would rule out major changes.

Should I worry?","Doctor":"Hello,I will refer my patients to the periodontist for treatment of advanced periodontal disease or unresponsive tissue conditions.  A change in tissue in color usually indicates a state of inflammation. Typically there is some swelling of tissue inbetween the teeth. Periodontal disease does not always warn patients with pain until an abscess or extreme amount of bone is lost. Lower front teeth may experience stress resulting in recession and loss of attached tissue. The attached tissue is the firmer tissue band that should surround and protect your teeth at the gum line. Did your dentist refer to mucoginigival concerns? Do you have bleeding, loose teeth or did the dentist mention probings?I recommend that you schedule your visit with the periodontist. You should plan on taking or having available a  full set of x-rays. Your medical history and habits will be reviewed and considered in your evaluation.  This specialist will recommend your needed treatment. You can relax and maintain good daily oral care and a balanced diet. Make sure that you do not have any vitamin deficiencies.Thank you for your inquiry.

Crown was ordered, but right before I was going to get the crown, I lost my health/dental insurance, so I didn't return to the dentist.  On three separate occasions since then, a small portion of the tooth has broken off and come out. Now, half of the tooth is left and in the last 3 weeks, I have a painful lump on the gum below. It has pus in it, so I know it's infected. The leftover tooth moves a little, but isn't loose enough to pull out. I've taken a needle (lit with a lighter and dipped in alcohol) and drained the lump twice myself.  I CANNOT go to a dentist. I have no insurance and am currently laid off. I'm lucky to be able to eat and have gas to get to job interviews literally, so please do not tell me I must go to a dentist or doctor.  I simply can't.  I have no choice but to self-treat.  I need to know if I should continue to drain the lump (will it eventually go away?), or do I need to go one step further and pull the tooth?  I'm thinking pulling it will get rid of the infection, but it will hurt like hell obviously so I'm not looking forward to that option.  In the meantime, I'm using anti-bacterial mouthwash 2-3x a day and brushing/flossing very well 2-3x a day.  Thank you in advance.  Samantha","Doctor":"HiThank you for your query with HCM, as such with your history as you mentioned you have peripaical infection and you need an dentist opinion too.

Take all medicine as prescribed by your dentist. Report your symptoms  to your dentist. Check for pressure and hot sensitivity. Check  for a bubble on the gum. Report any of these symptoms to your dentist concerning other teeth. The tooth needing a root canal may have raised up due to the infection and needs to be adjusted. This can cause pain to the opposing tooth by hitting it harder. An aggressive infection can cause swelling and other inflammatory reactions that will be relieved when the source is treated. It is possible that another tooth has become symptomatic and needs treatment.

I have trouble with a molar tooth on the right upper side of my mouth. Its got a small black hole and possibly decayed inside. Though a cavity doesnt seem to appear when taken a look outside. Its very sensitive to hot and sweet food items. I flinch out of piercing pain every time a sweet or hot food particle., or even when plain cool water comes in contact with that tooth. What is the best possible treatment I should go for? What is the cost incurred for the treatment in bangalore? Please help me find a good dentist in bangalore with name and contact details. Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello,I am glad to answer your dental question. The dark area indicates a change in the enamel and with a hole would be decay. Decay needs to be removed or continues to increase and reaches the nerve inside the tooth. Your sensitivity is expected when the protective enamel coating has been damaged. You may be able to fill the tooth if the decay has not affected the nerve chamber. Some sensitivity to sweets and cold often can be treated with a filling. Filling material is usually of a tooth colored composite. Other material choices include amalgam and if a larger section of the tooth needs replacement, then porcelain or a gold alloy should be considered. Once hot sensitivity and sharp pain become more prominent, you most likely have bacteria causing an abscess and will require a root canal or extraction. Sometimes  only a very small hole is visible to the eye, but much destruction of the underneath layer has occurred. The sooner this tooth is evaluated, the better chance for a restoration such as a filling. Your dentist will need an xray to evaluate the tooth and suggest your treatment options. Symptoms such as throbbing, swelling, a bubble on the gum or fracture suggest a greater chance of an infection. Avoid chewing on the tooth and keep the area as clean as possible. Schedule your dental visit as soon as possible.I cannot provide a name of a dentist in your area. You may ask your general physician for a recommendation. You can contact your local government agency for a list of licensed dentists or locate a dental school which has a clinic or request a referral.Thank you for your inquiry. I hope you will be able to schedule an appointment soon."},{"Patient":"My daughter had a loose tooth fall out and she now has noticed that she has a loose piece of gum flesh hanging from her upper gums.

Ask your daughter not to continously disturb the gum tissue tag which eventually heals by itself when left undisturbed.

Your medical history needs to be reviewed with your dentist. Out of control high blood pressure would be a reason not to extract until your blood pressure is under control. Taking a blood thinner would require a period of stopping the medication prior to an extraction. Your dentist will consult with your physician.You should consult with a dentist and have an x-ray taken. Antibiotics only control the spread of an infection. You must follow through with treatment. Usual options would include an extraction or root canal followed with a restoration.

The words subtle and superficial indicate less of a change or less invasion rather than a dense mass or extensive area showing change. You indicate ulcerated tissue present which is inflamed or abnormal tissue. There are lymph nodes, less than one centimeter in size, that are showing a change. The location is identified around and behind the submandibular glands in the neck with level IB and II noted. Identification of lymphatic drainage or metastases can help locate a tumor. The study indicates the location to be on side of your tongue. More information concerning the tissue requires a pathological study such as a biopsy. Tumors when removed are further evaluated with pathological studies. This will identify malignant and non-malignant tumors of the oral cavity. MRI study for the evaluation of squamous cell carcinoma is the primary concern. Other lesions to include in a possible diagnosis include lymphoma, adenoma, sarcoma, salivary gland tumor, abnormal adenoidal tissue or floor of the mouth tissue. Thank you for your inquiry.

I've had a consultation with an oral maxillofacial surgeon, who would operate to remove the cyst. I was a bit overwhelmed with our conversation and don't remember or didn't quite understand everything he said. He did say marsupialization, and he also said it was likely that the ranula would return after the first surgery because of the size of the cyst and the thinness of the tissue,  but that a second surgery if the recurring cyst was caught small enough could be removed.  I've also read that these ranula tend to return with just marsupialization and that the sublingual gland needs to be removed to prevent recurrence.  What is the \\"standard\\" procedure for ranula removal and what is the success rate? Do I even need to have it removed? Is the sublingual gland commonly removed? What are the risks?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The ranula can be removed surgically by either marsupialization or enucleation. when you do enucleation (indicated when the lesion is smaller), the complete cyst lining will be removed so the chances of reccurence rate is less. Where as in marsupialization(indicated when the lesionis bigger) the cyst will be opened and the edges will be sutured to the adjacent normal mucosa. Once the size of the lesion reducesThen a second surgery is done to remove the complete lining.There is no need to remove the gland as such, you can get the ranula removed.  You might end up with slight reduction in salivary secretion following gland removal, but it is negligible.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"Have a rotten odor from years of UTI ...allergic to sulfa, so have been taking Cipro for a long period of time.

Can you recall any trauma to the floor of your mouth? A sore spot or ulceration may develop. Rinse with warm salt water, avoid acidic and spicy foods and apply a benzocaine gel if very sensitive. This could be viral and needs time to heal. Anti-inflammatory medication such as Tylenol, Motrin or the anti-histamine Benadryl may reduce swelling.

If it is candidiasis then you have to take topical antifungal like candid mouth paint.If it is leukoplakia, you have to stop the habit of smoking and take antioxidants like capsule lycopene.if it is lichen planus then you have to take topical steroids like triamcinolone acetonide (0.1%) 4-5times daily for 1 week. You can also take topical anesthetic and analgesics like anabel gel for the pain.

You can use topical steroids like triamcinolone acetonide (0.1%) if it is erosive lichen planus or pemphigus. if it is candidiasis then you can take topical antifungal agents like candid mouth paint.If it is not healing for more thah 3weeks then you have to get a biopsy done to rule out any malignancy.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"I have a very swollen cheek along the jaw. I visited the dentist on Tuesday morning and was told I have an abscessed tooth where the infection has gone into the cheek. I have been on the prescribed medication since Tuesday lunchtime and today the swelling is far more prominent and I am having difficulty opening my mouth.","Doctor":"Hello,Your infection is not under control and symptoms are increasing. Call your dentist to report that your condition has not improved and is worse. Your dentist will need to increase the dosage or change your antibiotic. Make sure you are following directions on taking all medication. I usually recommend Amoxiciilin 500 mg or 875 mg depending on how often you take the antibiotic. Your dentist will recommend the next step for treatment of the abscess. You may need other oral conditions evaluated as well.Take anti-inflammatory medications in addition to the antibiotic. Tylenol and Motrin are effective choices. The choice of the antihistamine Benadryl also helps control swelling and control symptoms. Keep well hydrated. Do not stress your jaw. Avoid irritants. Continue daily dental care and rinsing.Thank you for your inquiry. I hope you will find relief with my suggestions and do not delay in contacting your dentist with an active infection present. I am glad to assist further if you have additional questions."},{"Patient":"Hi there for the past 2 years ive had pain and bloating on my right side of abdomen .

A side note, I smoke marijuana, and ten cigs a day.","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The hard bump on the inner surface of your gum could be because of a bony overgrowth like mandibular tori or exostosis or osteoma or garres osteomyelitis.Consult your oral physician and take a radiograph like mandibular occlusal and OPG to rule out above mentioned conditions. If it is mandibular tori or exostosis or osteoma it doesnot require any treatment unless it interfere with denture fabrication.

On vacation I went a little crazy with dipping the side of my gums became sore right on the ridge of the gums where the most pressure and abbrasion from the dip would occure.

I have a 3 or 4 large dips a day for the last 6 months and I always shift it around to decrease the abrasive nature of the tabacoo, I always stuff my mouth so full when I do it, it creates pressure.

In this the drugs are placed within the space between gums and teeth so that effectiveness of the drug is more without any systemic adverse effects.The local drug delivery system is indicated when there is severe gum infection like periodontitis, peridontal abscess.

The complications associated by stopping the drug is more than the bleeding encountered during surgical procedure."},{"Patient":"Hi im 20 im 5'8 190 lbs . . . i have been suffering from toothaches on a chipped moler for about 6 months now but have been putting off the dentist due to lack of health insurance , i had consulted a dentist a couple months ago and she told me i had to have a root canal or pull it out but like i said i put it off . . .about 4 days ago i had a toothache come on again in the same spot i always get them in but a little more painful this time .. . i had a tiny small abscess on my gum that went away , i took some penicilin ( still taking ) and 600 mg motrin for the pain ....now the pain is deff gone but yesterday morning i noticed i have some sort of lump or raised area under my jaw like under my sking but under the side where the tooth hurts . .like i said the pain is gone now but i still have like a raised area that does not really hurt but if i open my mouth to wide it aches just a bit . . i have no idea what it could be ? idk if it is related to the tooth infection or something else . . because i am really in no pain at all just the raised area under my jaw line undr my skin . . .  i dont know if it is just swollen or something else i am really worried..pleas help, thanks alot!","Doctor":"Hello,You describe symptoms of an infection not fully treated and going through different stages. Realize that the source of the infection has not been eliminated since you have not removed or treated the tooth. You may be developing a resistant infection. Infections spread and can cause a generalized swelling or pool into an area with a pocket of pus. This may need to be drained and require additional antibiotic treatment. Lymph nodes can become swollen with dental infections present. Infections flare up and calm down with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications, but you risk a more serious ,long term infection being more difficult to control. Stay on the anti-inflammatory medication Motrin. Make an appointment with your dentist before the condition gets worse. Once you treat the tooth, I expect your dental health to improve, since this is most likely related to the abcessed tooth. Consider having a dental exam and cleaning for an overall evaluation of your dental health.I understand your concern with cost and not having dental insurance, but dental conditions untreated tend to get worse. This means additional dental treatment and more costs. Many dental offices offer payment plans or work with health credit cards that offer a payments plans with a period of no interest .Thank you for your inquiry. I hope you seek treatment and feel better soon. Please ask any additional questions and I will be glad to offer assistance."},{"Patient":"Hello, I've been taking two minocycline 100 mg capsules daily for 3 weeks and have developed small dark spots on my gums and the skin inside of my mouth.

I was given a general anesthesia of some sort. Prior to the surgery, I was given a valium and four amoxicillin to take one hour before my appointment (which I did). My top two wisdom teeth were partially erupted, the one on my left side having come in halfway. It had a cavity that was filled by my dentist a year ago. This was a temporary measure as I did not have health insurance at that time (I have it now). My bottom two wisdom teeth were impacted. After the surgery, I applied ice to my face for most of the day, ate soft foods (like applesauce and mashed potatoes). I was given an antiseptic mouth rinse, which I am still using twice a day. I also have starting rinsing my mouth several times a day with warm salt water after I eat to keep my wounds clean. I bush my teeth carefully twice a day, and I don't smoke or eat spicy food. I have been taking vicodin every day since the surgery to deal with the pain. At first, the vicodin helped--on the first two days. However, after that (and after the anesthesia wore off completely--my jaw began to ache badly, so badly I couldn't go back to sleep until I put ice around my face and took a vicodin. I am still experiencing some serious pain in my lower jaw and on the sides of my head. The vicodin doesn't seem to work very well half the time, and the pain distracts me most of the time from doing or thinking about anything else. I've also been having trouble sleeping, experiencing dizziness/light-headedness, some headaches, and some nausea. I don't seem to have any pus forming around the surgical wounds, nor do I seem to have a fever. The surgical wounds hurt sometimes, but it feels more like it's my jaw that's hurting so badly, but I can't always tell. Is there something wrong, like a dry socket or an infection? Is my jaw perhaps damaged? Is the vicodin not compatible with me? Please help because I'm really freaked out and kind of scared right now.

May be the dentist could not find the other cavities which might be due to initial lesions/cavities. 2. your diet and oral hygiene habits which play a major role might be another cause.cavities donot become too many in a aspan of 6 months it takes time but your oral hygiene and food plays a major role in increasing the cavities.maintain good oral hygiene with proper brushing technique and get all the instructions from your dentist too.Hope this helps you"},{"Patient":"i ate something hot and crispy from the microwave and right after I went to wash out my mouth there was a lump of blood clot gathers in the center of the roof of my mouth.

Before going back to him is there anything else I can do? Will TCP work? Also, can I use dettol antiseptic in my mouth? Thanks sam","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The gum infection around an implant cane be treated with a course of antibiotics and analgesics along with curettage. Regarding implants, you take an opinion from one more implantologist and get yourself examined. If the gum infection is there we can treat it but if the implant mobility is started then it indicates that the implant has failed to integrate with the bone. This can be tested by the implantologist by tapping on the implant with the back end of the probe and check for the sound and check the mobility of the implant. i hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"hi i have epigastric pain about three weeks and i t stopped for two days but now i am feeling in whole body. sometimes have breathing problems and passing through urine feeling burning and coulor changes sometime please tell what it could be thank you","Doctor":"Welcome to Healthcare Magic You are probably having urinary tract infection which explains the burning micturition.

After the cold sores/fever blisters went away I got a small white bump on my lower gum about 2nd to last tooth (the one that had the root canal redone.)  I went back to the specialist that did the root canal and my dentist and all they say is that we will watch it, is this something I should get a second opinion on?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for your query.It sounds like you have a fistula.The fistula is the result of an abscessed tooth and a failed root canal.The abscess is an infection that first forms around the apex or tip of the root. If left untreated the infection will begin to erode the bone around the tooth. You are going to need root canal surgery called a apicoectomy in order to save this tooth. Usually, a tooth that has undergone a root canal can last the rest of your life and never need further endodontic treatment. However,in a few cases,a tooth may fail to heal.The tooth may become painful or diseased months or even years after successful treatment. An apicoectomy is a way to save a tooth when inflammation or infection persists in the bony area around the end of your tooth after a root canal procedure. The endodontist will open the gum tissue near the tooth to see the underlying bone and to remove any inflamed or infected tissue. The very end of the root is also removed. A small filling may be placed to seal the end of the root canal and a few stitches are placed in the gum to help the tissue heal. The dentist will remove the bump or fistula and with a good result and a good immune system the tooth will heal and the fistula will not return.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"I had all 4 wisdom teeth removed about 4 days ago now. the bottom left is the only one that still hurts a bit, it is also producing a brownish liquid that tastes horrible.

Do you have a plate that fits on the roof of your mouth? New denture wearers have an adjustment period, but I do not expect this to continue for months. Common issues that affect speech include:-excess saliva-tongue movement-adjustments needed to teeth and biteYou will have excess saliva  until you get used to something in your mouth. Your tongue has to get used to the plate covering the palate. If the tongue feels restricted, ask if an adjustment can be made to reduce the amount of material or thickness of material on the plate. If the position of the teeth affect your speech, the bite can be adjusted. This is often a simple reshaping to improve how your teeth meet or a slight reduction to the edge of teeth to shorten the length.Most often, time and practice will resolve your speech difficulties. Try an astringent mouthwash to reduce saliva. Return to your dentist for an adjustment if you do not feel your speech improve, but be patient. If you do not notice an improvement in a couple of weeks schedule a visit. Also, if you develop sore spots, schedule a visit for a simple adjustment. a less common occurance is an allergic reaction to the materials used.If you have a fixed bridge and continue with speech difficulties, you will need the dentist to adjust your bite. Call for an evaluation follow up visit.I am available to answer additional questions and hope you will not continue with speech difficulties after following my suggestions.

My mounth is opening 35mm wide and colour of internal mocousa is changing. My doctor added Absolut 3G capsule for last one month and continue anti allergy capsule atrax 10mg and amitop10 tablets. Looks like things are getting resolved, my question is: 1. do i need to go for laser treament to open my mouth wider? its already opening 35+MM or it will be better in future by the medicines i am taking. 2. I have already quit gutkha from last 10 months and 9 months under treatment of OSMF, will it eliminate all the probability of oral cancer in future ?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for your query.OSMF Is a precancerous condition but if you have stopped gutkha and can maintain the mouth opening of 35mm plus ie: 3-4 fingers wide, then you may not go for laser treatment. Chances of getting cancer in the future are also very low. But its best to have your vits. and continue with the yearly check ups with the dentist and oral exercises which I am certain you must be doing.Hope this helps.Regards"},{"Patient":"hi, for the past couple weeks i have been noticing black spots either on my gums or teeth, but its in between my teeth so i cant really tell. everytime i brush my teeth i bleed. in the middle of the day i start to bleed alot randomly. earlier i drank some water and i stared bleed alot. there is no pain but its very scary.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for your query.What you have described seems to be tartar as it may look black due to stains. it sits in between teeth, on teeth and gums as well. Presence of tartar causes gingivitis ie : inflammation of the gums resulting in bleeding.I would suggest you to visit your dentist for a thorough clean up ie: scaling and polishing which will resolve your problem and make your gums healthy.Regards"},{"Patient":"I got my two lower wisdom teeth removed a week and a day ago today. The dentist said that he had to do no cutting and both teeth were easy to remove. Two days after surgery I notice on the lower right side an opening of gum tissue  going up my cheek connected to the hole. I'm scared I accidentally ripped my gum upwards. There's no significant pain but a little red around the right socket. Also, ive been really nauseous and there's a tingling in my throat that has been present for the last 4 days. Should I be worried?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for your query. Ideally an extraction site take around 10-15 days to heal depending on patients body resistance. The opening of gum tissue attached to the extraction site is hanging there because it was attached to the tooth but now is just there as the tooth has been removed. I don't think you should worry about it. Give it some time to heal. The tingling in throat after a week may not be related to the extraction. Still, I would suggest that you visit your dentist for a thorough check up.Hope this helps.

Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello,Blood mixing with saliva and drying on the lips is certainly a possibility. The cause could be dental related. Make sure your daughter is up-to-date with her dental exam and cleaning. Gingivitis may be causing gums to bleed easily and requires attention with good daily home dental care that must include proper brushing, flossing, and rinsing.  A dry mouth may stress oral tissue. Does your daughter breathe through her mouth at night? Does your daughter take any medications that make the gums more prone to bleeding? She may need to increase her daily care routine to reduce bleeding of inflamed gums or consider an alternate medication.Other medical conditions should be considered. A routine blood test with your physician is suggested. I recommend checking if your daughter is anemic as well. Maintain a proper diet with balanced vitamins. Keep well hydrated.Thank you for your inquiry. I hope my suggestions are helpful. I am available to answer additional questions."},{"Patient":"My friend constantly complains to tooth pain.

My first recommendation is to continue diligent home dental hygiene. Increase attention to areas that bleed. Brushing, flossing and rinsing are all important. Include brushing your to tongue, Keep well hydrated. Follow proper nutrition with balanced vitamins. Make sure you have adequate vitamin B. Avoid your irritants such as smoking. Avoid acidic foods and liquids. Were you recommended any specific rinses? You could consider a chlorhexidine gluconate rinse.Do you have any medical conditions or take any medications that aggravate your oral health? Some medications cause a dry mouth or can promote bleeding. Healing can be compromised and take a longer time for gingivitis to resolve.Do you have any allergies? If you are congested and breathing through your mouth, there can be irritation to your front teeth tissue and a thicker, more difficult plaque to remove.What is your recall schedule with your dentist? Did your dentist indicate that you required any additional professional cleanings such as a deep scale done with anesthesia by quadrants? Did your dentist make any recommendations to you such as corrections to your bite? An open bite will cause you to breathe through your mouth and often experience chronic irritation to tissue on your front teeth.I suggest you contact your dentist and report your condition. Your dentist will advise you if you need to return for an appointment sooner and make further recommendations for your homecare.Thank you for your inquiry.

Common conditions include:-inadequate apical seal-additional untreated canal-fracture of rootI recommend taking an x-ray to evaluate the healing process. Antibiotic treatment may help the area to resolve. Amoxicilin is the typical antibiotic of choice. The history of the tooth and events concerning the need of the root canal would be helpful. A very resistant infection may require additional antibiotic treatment. Is this a recent root canal needing more time to heal? Did you take antibiotics and complete the medication as prescribed? You can have resistant infection that may be resolved with antibiotic treatment. The tooth would continued to be monitored at recall visits if it responded well and no other problems were diagnosed. What is the description of the bump? Is it filled with fluid and drains?I recommend rinsing the area with warm salt water and taking anti-inflammatory medications such as Tylenol or Motrin to help resolve the bump until you rturn to the dentist for further evaluation.You may consider an evaluation by a root canal specialist.

Was glad to find that I don't have a dry socket but several things are worrying me: Firstly it looks like 2 roots have been left in there, can this be right? Will it have complications later on? As the tooth was suppose to be taken out due to pus being developed on the gum and was infecting everything around it,..?Secondly, the tooth next to it it's gum split...one side is flopping around? Will it grow back together?Shall I be rebooking to go and see the dentist? Thank you in advance","Doctor":"Hello,First, no roots should be left after the extraction. Healing tissue will have a different appearance than fully healed tissue in the socket. You should return for an evaluation if the structures are hard and look like roots. Was any material added to the socket to promote healing?It will take time for the inflammation to go away and the source must be removed completely. Take all medications as prescribed. You may continue anti-inflammatory medication to continue to reduce symptoms.Second, removing a tooth requires some disturbance to tissue and it can be separated and appear flapping from adjacent teeth. Keep the area clean and continue to rinse. Avoid area while chewing and do not let anything get caught under the tissue. Again, return for an evaluation to monitor healing. More time will allow healing and firmer tissue around the tooth. If iit does no tighten around the tooth, other periodontal considerations may be needed.Thank you for your inquiry.

Additional details would be helpful to assist with a diagnosis and make recommendations. It may be a normal condition. You are able to test for specific friut reactions by trial and elimination. Try cutting the fruit to see if you have the same reaction. Consider any changes to dental products used. Allergic reactions are possible when trying different products.Increase in bruising can indicate other systemic concerns. Do you bruise easily? An increase in blood pressure can make vessels more prominent. Do you have prominent veins elsewhere such as spider veins?  Dermatologists may offer treatment options to reduce visibility of these vessel conditions. Make sure to check your blood pressure. Have an updated physical with blood tests to check for deficiencies. Keep well hydrated. This helps flush away inflammation. taking anti-inflammatory medications may offer relief. Benadryl, an antihistamine, reduces swelling and assists healing.Bring your concerns to the attention of your dentist. Your dentist can check your bite and make adjustments if needed. Sometimes the gum tissue can react to metals or cements used in the mouth. Have you noticed any changes close to your recent dental work? Oral infections can be carried in salvia and with contact to the skin around the mouth cause a reaction. Your dentist may suggest a visit to the dermatologist if there are no dental conditions that require treatment to resolve your concerns. Regular good daily dental hygiene is important. Proper nutrition, vitamins and hydration affects your overall health. Avoid irritants such as smoking. I hope your condition will improve and that my suggestions are helpful.

The wisdom tooth may have moved and you see changes. Go to the dentist for an x-ray and re-evaluation for extraction. You can rinse with warm salt water and monitor for changes. Your jaw continues to grow and respond to pressure.It is common to have lower tori which are  bone bumps usually poisitioned more forward near your canines and premolars.If you feel inflamed or swollen, take anti-inflammatory medication and consult your dentist. Swollen glands, which are usually softer, indicate an active infection. Infection from a tooth can drain and cause a lump. Expansion may be related to a cyst or other growth.Thank you for your inquiry.

There is more tooth loss, commonly, due to lack of supporting bone than decay. Have you been to a periodontist? Periodontal disease is a progessive disease and preventive measures are important for keeping your teeth.I need more information on your dental health history. Have you keep up with routine cleanings and exams? Have you had a history of a high rate of decay, abscesses or gum treatments?Overall health changes affect the oral environment. Medications have side effects. Dry mouth is a common side effect and causes an increase in decay and inflammed tissue. Your dentist can help address your individual conditions and make suggestions. Rinse with warm salt water and maintain good daily dental care.Your immune system definitely influences the oral environment. Your dentist will consider this when making dental care recommendations. Keep up with a nutritious diet, balanced vitamins and keep well hydrated. Opportunistic infections are a risk in your mouth. Imbalances can cause common infections such as Thrush.Thank you for your inquiry. I hope my suggestions have been helpful.

I started feeling pain yesterday, I was able to get some food cough up in there but it just kept hurting. Today I look in the mirror and saw that the gums around that tooth are full of white little patches and is still hurting I clean the area with cotton and I was left with all this small blood red looking wholes. What can I do?","Doctor":"Hello,I tell my patients that if you can keep your wisdom teeth clean and if they function as a pair, they should not be extracted. You describe an area that is constantly difficult to clean and now is infected. Continue to clean the area and rinse vigorously with warm salt water. Remove any debris from around the tooth. Interdental cleaners and a water pic may be helpful to flush the area successfully. It will not feel better immediately. Use a chlorhexdine glucnate or a betadine rinse if available. Take anti-infammatory medication such as Motrin or Tylenol. If swelling increases, you will need to have your dentist curettage the area under local anesthesic and take a prescribed  antibiotic. This may reoccur and become a chronic condition best treated with an extraction. If the tissue does not improve, your dentist may need to prescribe medication and determine if the condition is due to a fungal, baccterial or viral condition.Did you bite the gum area while numb after the filling was completed? Is any of the filling missing? Deep fillings can be sensitive or need evaluation for an abscess by your dentist. I recommend a return visit to check for these conditions.Thank you for your inquiry. I hope that you feel better soon"},{"Patient":"hi im 19 years old..has normal BMI..i am worried since my last tooth, the one before the wisdom tooth erupts had swollen gum.however my wisdom tooth had recently erupt in the area no further from the swollen gum..is there a need to be worry?..please give an advice..","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for posting here.You did not mention if you have any discomfort in the gums, bleeding,pain,etc.Use a mild mouthwash thrice daily.MaIntain a good oral hygiene.Use flagyl 400mg thrice daily and MoxikindCV twice daily for three days.Take a OTC pain killer if you experience pain.Recurring swelling or discomfort is a indication of persisting infection.In this case, removal of the third molar must be done.Regards."},{"Patient":"Age: 28(in a few days)Height: 5'8\\"Weight: 185Bp normal, but has been high in the pastConcerned about being at risk for DiabetesCan allergy medication mask an oral infection?I've been battling an oral infection for quite a few weeks now (Four to be exact), and I believed it to be thrush (yeast infection). I first went to Planned Parenthood and received fluconazole (Diflucan), which I've had before, and a week's worth of metronidazole (Flagyl), just in case Bacterial Vaginosis went undetected. The Diflucan I've taken before, but at this particular visit was the only time I've taken Diflucan in two consecutive weeks. The white spots cleared up, following the treatment, as well as using geranium violet, gargling with warm salt water (after eating), eating 2 cups of pro-biotic yogurt a day, and taking at least 3 heaping spoonfuls of wet garlic a day and letting it sit in my mouth for a few minutes before swallowing. And, brushing my teeth before using garlic, disinfecting the toothbrush before and after brushings. My diet consisted of hardly any breads, but when I did, toasted wheat bread was consumed. I went to urgent care for a check up and, since I've been trying home remedies and there are no visible signs, I was sent home untreated and without tests done. A few days later (and after going to a very smoky rave), I developed a sore throat. I went in and was prescribed Nazonex. It left a stinging sensation in my throat, and decided to take Claritan-D instead. That helped with the the sore throat and nasal congestion, but now I'm out of the 5-day medication and concerned if the meds are masking a real issue, or have I not been taking them long enough? With the Claritan, I've been trying to remember to take acidophilus pills, 500mg, twice daily.My question is, can allergy meds mask an oral infection? I'm concerned that I may have some other bacterial infection. Each time I go to urgent care, they don't take any cultures, they only do a visual inspection. I don't have health insurance and can't afford the 80 visit to urgent care, if they aren't going to properly treat me. As a side note, I have been tested for other sexual diseases, and the results are all negative (HIV, herpes, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia). When they looked in my mouth, they just said it looked a little red, and that my nose was draining, and gave me the Nazonex. At the moment, it feels like there is a some sort of small blockage at the base of the throat (\\"Adam's\\" apple area) and nasal airway, and there are sores on the tip of my tongue and the base of my lower and upper teeth in the same area; however, I'm not certain if its from the yeast coming back or if I just simply burned my mouth on yesterday's lunch :-/ The bumps look small, round, red, and flat, and are mostly located on the perimeter of the tongue near the front teeth.On the positive side, my vagina stopped itching (first time in five months), but I haven't so much as kissed my man since the oral outbreak :-(","Doctor":"Hello,I have read your inquiry and appreciate your details to assist in treatment recommendations. You describe a constant on going irritation that sounds more like the allergy condition causing oral symptoms. The allergy medications have a drying effect which may give you a dry mouth. Dealing with allergies causes you congestion, breathing through your mouth, post nasal drip which is irritating to the throat and causes an acidic oral environment. If you do not remove the irritant, you will have a constant battle. These conditions and taking antibiotics can make you prone to Thrush. Stress can cause ulcerations. Bumps can be a reaction to irritation with swollen papillae on the tongue.I recommend keeping extremely well hydrated. Proper nutrition with balanced vitamins is important. Make sure you have aequate vitamin B complex to assist healing. Avoid all irritants such as smoking, alcohol and acidic foods. There are dental products for treating dry mouth including rinses, toothpaste and sprays. These may be effective for you. You will need to try them and decide if you notice a difference. Practice excellent oral hygiene including brushing your tongue.You should visit your dentist and have a routine exam and cleaning. Rule out any dental conditions that need treatment. A clinical exam will allow diagnosis of any oral infections that  should be addressed.If you still suspect a respiratory or sinus infection source, you will have to return to a physician for treatment. Consider visiting an allergist to determine exactly what your sensitivities are. Have you ever considered allergery shots? I understand that you are uncomfortable and frustrated with an ongoing condition. I hope my recommendations offer some relief.

Floss once a day.Mouth wash thrice a week(diluted in 1:1 ratio with water).Do not overuse mouth wash.Smoking,other tobacco habits,old unclean denture and gum infection can also cause this.Diabetics,liver and kidney disease ,tonsillitis and other respiratory infections potentially cause halitosis.Check if you have a low salivary flow.If any of the above includes your general health, this has to be corrected immediately.Use saliva substitutes if you suffer low saliva flow.Keep away garlic,onion,tobacco products.Have plenty fluids., 3-3.5 liters per day.Keep hydrated.regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, About 4 years ago, I experienced the worst pain in the right side of my face (I was out of work for 3 days straight).

I discovered two spots on my tongue ( on opposite sides but symetrical ) that are hard in the inside almost like lumps but inside the tongue not on the outter area . I think I remeber biting it but Im not sure","Doctor":"Hello,I have read you inquiry. Biting your tongue could cause a reaction that you describe. Warm salt water rinses, avoiding spicy and acidic foods, anti-inflammatory medication such as Tylenol or Motrin and continued daily home dental care will assist healing. Keep well hydrated and proper nutrition with balanced vitamins especially vitamin B.  Avoid irritants such as smoking and alcohol. you can apply a benzocaine numbing gel if sensitive. You can can have a remaining solid feeling for a longer period with no concern if you bit  the tongue rather hard. It takes time for inflammation to resolve.Observe the area. Look for ulceration and monitor appearance. If your condition worsens or causes an increase in pain, swelling or function, see your dentist for an evaluation. Monitor tongue for any other changes such as size, color, and coating.Other considerations:-inflamed papillae -growth, cyst, tumor-allergic reaction- rough , broken teeth or dental appliance-grinding teeth, likely at night-change in or stressful bite-infection: bacterial, fungal, virusThank you for consulting Heathcare Magic.

I am taking painkillers which relieves the pain for about 3-4 hours, then it comes back and I take more painkillers which relieve the pain for another 3-4 hours, and so on. I am very worried about getting dry socket as I have been reading about it online. Yesterday around 1pm which was about 4 hours after wisdom tooth removal, I took a tablet for the pain, and when I swallowed it I swallowed it quite vigorously and immediately felt an intense aching throbbing pain where the tooth was removed. After the painkillers kicked in the paid faded away and now I just feel moderate pain, nothing intense. But I am worried I dislodged the blood clot when I swallowed the tablet because of the pain I felt afterwards, do you think this could have caused dry socket? I have stitches in my mouth where the tooth was pulled out, I know that you can still get dry socket though, my question is that if I do develop dry socket will the pain start after the stitches dissolve or will the pain start 3-5 days after the procedure which is the usual time it takes? My dentist also told me that there will not be a hole exposed as she stitched it up, so to me that meant that when the stitches dissolve, the hole where my tooth was will be covered by my gums and the hole will not be exposed, is that correct? Thank you.","Doctor":"HiWith your query, since your socket is stiched there are no chances of blood getting dislodged soon. Any extracted impacted tooth pain lasts fir 3-4 days for some 7-10 days it depends on how much bone is covered on the tooth and how difficult it became to the dentist to remove it I mean time taken coz if mire bone had to removed then it takes time and it causes more pain and swelling so wait for week and then get it checked by your dentist"},{"Patient":"I am experiencing swelling with a wisdom tooth that is coming in.

If the area is infected or gets worse, please seek professional care with your dentist or oral surgeon.Rinse with warm salt water to cleanse and soothe the area. Avoid any irritants such as smoking, alcohol, acidic foods and liquids, spicy, crusty and hard foods. Do not stess the jaw and keep a soft diet. Keep well hydrated to assist healing.

I suggest you consult an oral surgeon or ear, nose and throat specialist. It is rarely fractured unless there is violent squeezing. Muscles and ligaments hold it in place offering the protection of flexibility. Cartilage is also in the throat. This bone is also well protected by the mandible. There are blood vessels near by. Torn tissue is a possibility.Are you experiencing any changes associated with your tongue and speech? Do you feel gagging or cough with pain? Swelling or discomfort associated with swallowing and chewing indicate more reason to feel concern. Monitor for signs of tissue change with bruising indicating bleeding. If you have swollen lymph nodes this could indicate an infection due to mouth, sinus or respiratory conditions. You may have discomfort due to these conditions.Take anti-inflammatory medication such as Tylenol or Motrin. Benadryl antihistamine may be helpful. Do not stress the throat. Keep well hydrated with liquids and a soft diet. Avoid all irritants including smoking, alcohol, acidic and spicy foods and liquids, hard or crusty foods. Do apply any pressure to the throat or stress the jaw with excessive movements.Diagnosis can be difficult . X-rays, CT scan and a laryngoscopes may be recommended if a break is suspected.Thank you for your inquiry. I hope you feel better soon and continue with an evaluation if you continue to suspect a fracture and especially if symptoms increase."},{"Patient":"I have pain in the middle of my abdomen.

Now the pain is not terrible but feels like heart burn and get worse some times.","Doctor":"Hi, After reading your problem, I would like to know if you have any other problem besides heartburn, like, pain increasing after taking food or vomiting like, heartburn may possibly due to the acidity in the stomach which can be relieved by taking an antacid and avoiding spicy foods. The pain which is felt after lifting heavy things is due to the stretch on your abdominal muscles. Please avoid lifting heavy weights suddenly, a gradual increase in the weight you lift will not cause the pain. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

The pain itself doesn't feel gastric, instead it feels like the muscle is strained or like there is a bruise in the area. At first the pain only occurred when would cough, but now sudden movements hurt too, and the pain is from my lower abdomen up to the the bottom rib on my rib cage and feels like I have a big bruise in the area. The pain has been lurching to the right and the area is tender to the touch, but it is also fairly mild. I don't have any more symptoms; no fever, no loss of appetite, no nausea, and I really haven't engaged in any activities to bring this on. I was just wondering if I should be concerned about this due to it's sudden nature and the area of pain.","Doctor":"Hey this looks more like a muscular one rather than something internal. Have you done any strenous exercise and thereby got this pain, then it is confirm. And if it comes suddenly then it could be a muscle spasm but due to intestinal problems as well."},{"Patient":"my three year old has a very creamy white tounge looks very tierd round the eyes and was in hospital in norvember with h1n1 althouge he received no treatment as his diagnosis was only confirmed in may. he stayed in hospital for 9 days. his appetite is not what it use to be but he is on line in both hight and weight. what could be wrong with him?","Doctor":"Hello,I have reviewed your inquiry. Your son's health seems to still be compromised. I suggest you evaluate the tongue further and see if the tongue is coated with a white material. Try to brush the tongue and maintain good daily dental hygiene. Make sure he is well hydrated. He may suffer from a dry mouth. Do you see ulcerated sores? This can be a virus in the mouth and it will take time to heal. Keep the mouth clean. What is the condition of his teeth? Do you see any thick white coating on the teeth? Are there other dental concerns? Does your son complain about discomfort? At this age, you must assist your son and all aspects of his dental care. Dental exams are recommended at age 3.My first consideration would be a fungal infection that would need treatment with antifungal medicine such as nystatin. A visit to your dentist would allow further evaluation and a prescription if necessary. Rinsing with warm salt water can also have a cleansing effect.If the tongue is white in overall appearance and does not appear normal color, I would suspect a blood deficiency. Your son may be anemic or need additional iron supplements. You should consider updating blood tests and consult with your physician concerning your son's overall health after the recent flu. Maintain a proper diet with balanced vitamins. Avoid any vitamin deficiencies. Hydration is very important to health overall.Thank you for your inquiry. I hope my suggestions are helpful. I am glad to answer additional questions."},{"Patient":"Hi. I am 32 years old and as of 3 weeks ago a smokeless tobacco user.  I have developed a sore/ulcer on my gums under my bottom teeth.  It is not overly painful and seems to be slowly going away.  Is this anything I should be worried about.  I know it is from the repeated use of smokeless tobacco, but does not seem to look like any of the pictures of oral cancer I have seen online.  Just a small open sore.  I have been told that in a week or so time these usually go away, but I just thought I'd seek some professional advice.","Doctor":"Hello,You should feel relief  that the area is healing, but this tobacco habit is absolutcputting yourself in a high risk category. Repeat episodes definitely warrant observation by a professional Nd any abnormal tissue will require a biopsy. Please consider dropping this habit. Continue to monitor the lesion. Rinse with warm salt water often. Keep your mouth clean with good daily care inuding proper brushing and flossing. Keep well hydrated and good nutrition with balanced vitamins. Please keep up with your routine exams and always mention your habit. There are a number of early diagnostic tests that can be included at your check up visits inuding swabbing with diagnostic liquid and viewing with special lighting. Early diagnosis is critical in treatment for cancer.Thank you for your inquiry.

Take some anti-inflammatory  medicine such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Benadryl, an antihistamine, can be effective. You will need to go to the emergency room if this continues. Your dentist can give you a prescription and also evaluate if you need a steroid to control rapid increasing swelling. As you state, you wi need to an the extractions, but you need antibiotics  now. Some infections need to be drained if a pocket of pus is trapped in the jaw. Rinse your mouth with warm salt  water to help drainage if you have an area in the mouth that can river pressure, such as a fistula.Thank you for your inquiry.

If after 48 hours use heat to increase circulation and improve healing. Anti-inflammatory medication such as Tylenol or Advil is advised. Avoid massaging or added stress to the area. You don't want any additional bleeding which would cause more pressure. Keep well hydrated with a soft diet. The swelling should slowly resolve. Follow proper nutrition with balanced vitamins and maintain gentle, good daily dental care.Contact your dentist if area does not continue to improve.

I take vit and a multi vitamin almost daily... what's happening to me?","Doctor":"Hello,I have read your your inquiry and understand your concern. I can only suggest treatment of symptoms for your mouth ulcers since you are experiencing a wide range of systemic affects. I suspect you have activated a viral type of reaction in your mouth. You are correct to have balanced vitamins and proper nutrition. Avoid irritants such as smoking and alcohol. Make sure you have adequate vitamin B complex. Warm salt water rinse cleanses  and soothes your gums. Maintain good day dental care and include brushing your tongue. See your dentist to rule out dental problems such as broken teeth, infections and periodontal conditions that need treatment. A dry mouth can promote oral infections including bacterial, fungal and viral in nature. Your dentist can examine your mouth and diagnosis any of theses conditions. Keep well hydrated.  Rest and lessening stress can reduce chances of ulcers returning.Take anti-inflammatory medicine such as Tylenol or Advil. Benadryl, an antihistamine may help discomfort reducing inflammation. Ask about a rinse combination of pain relief, anti-inflammatory and treatment medicine such as Nystatin for a fungal condition if you are having much discomfort. Thank you got your inquiry. I hope my recommendations are helpful and you feel better soon."},{"Patient":"Just since this June I have been experiencing some problems with what seems to be TMJD.  I get pressure in the side of my jaw when chewing, talking, or anxious.  I have flare ups, sometimes its better depending on what I have been eating.  I'm very confused because I've been getting a lot of different opinions.  My gerneral dentist told me that there isn't much that can be done other than monitoring what I eat, taking anti-inflammatory, using a night guard, and using heat.  An orthodontist told me (at the consultation) that my bite is off and it was causing my TMD issue because it is making the muscle flex constantly because of being out of allignment.  He told me that I need Orthognathic surgery to split and widen my upper jaw before he will consider putting braces on me.  An oral surgeon I went to said that I should not have surgey because it could make it worse and he doesn't detect a joint problem and told me that braces would not help.  Im so confused now, any imput would be appreciated.  Im not concerned with getting braces or fixing my bite unless it would help the TMJ/D.  Im a little concerned about having such a major surgery if there is a possibility I will still have the TMD or worse problems yet, I have a two year old.  Could pulling teeth possibly help anything? Thank you for your time.","Doctor":"Hello,I have read your inquiry and understand your confusion. I would need more details to give you my opinion. I can tell from the opinions expressed that you must have a large discrepancy between your jaws. Do you have an underbite or overbite? Do you have a very narrow upper jaw? For adults, this is a common jaw relationship that I see which can not be corrected with just braces. In children, since the jaw is growing, guidance to the jaw with the pressure of braces can accomplish both tooth movement and jaw changes. Yes, as an adult serious surgery would be necessary and braces alone would not be able to alter the jaw relationship. No, pulling your teeth does not solve the jaw relationship and you risk difficulty with functioning of the dentures. You need additional opinions to decide the risks and benefits of such a surgery. I can not tell with out X-rays, photos, models and clinical exam why the surgeon fed there is a risk of your situation getting worse. You are not getting a report of a damaged joint needing joint surgery which means anything you do to prevent stress on the joint is beneficial. Follow your suggestions of your dentist. This is a common treatment that I recommend to my patients. You need to relieve some pressure on your jaw. You most likely grind your teeth at night adding stress. The guard slows down wear and reduces muscle spasms. This can take weeks to notice relief, adjusting of guard and may need a stronger medication for relief initially such as Flexeril which is one for muscle relaxation or steroids. Consider an opinion from the dental specialist called a prosthodontist. Thank you for your inquiry. I hope my opinion gives you some guidance and that I have been helpful. I hope you will feel better with use of a mouth guard."},{"Patient":"I had taken flexeril for several months and had a severe case of dry mouth for about 2 months before I stopped taking the drug. Most of my symptoms have gone away but I continue to have a numb feeling on the right side of my tongue. Will that eventually clear up as well?","Doctor":"Hello,You are suffering a common side effect  of flexeril with dry mouth. Considered rare, but known as a side effect, is numbness and tingling in the mouth. Flexeril length of use could affect the length of your side effects. Since this drug affects the neurotransmission, there is a good chance that once no longer in your system, you will return to normal transmission. If you are going from numbness to tingling that is a sign of return of sensation. Allow time to pass. Reduce any inflammation by avoiding irritants and take some anti-inflammatory medications. Proper nutrition and balanced vitamins are recommended. Avoid any deficiencies and keep well hydrated.I recommend that you discuss your symptoms further with your doctor. This drug has been reported to have a number of side effects. You may contact the drug manufacturer to find the most up to date data reported on this drug. Long term use and abrupt termination is not recommended. Review your complete medical history with your doctor to evaluate for any interactions. This may help you to understand your current symptoms and methods to restore normal sensation.Thank you for your inquiry.

This antibiotic helped control the spread of the infection and calmed down your symptoms. Now you are faced with the area around the tooth reacting and swelling to make the tooth rise up from the socket. You must treat the tooth. The options are a root canal or extraction. Drainage most likely is occurring due to your description. This is acidic and could bother your stomach and cause systemic affects including a fever. This may have been draining for a long time before you became aware of symptoms again. You most likely will need to start the antibiotic again. Schedule a visit with your dentist to decide  how to proceed. Chances are the upset is all coming from your tooth.

He had already used up all of my insurance on the fillings, so said the permanent filling could be done in an year. Is it safe to wait for an year, I am not really sure if he did the sealing properly.","Doctor":"Hello,After pulpitis and root canal therapy, there will be a period of healing required before the tooth feels better. The antibiotic should help healing and reduce inflammation. Take some anti-inflammatory medication such as Tylenol or Motrin. Return to your dentist for a follow up visit if it is not improving or feels worse. Do you hit the tooth hard when you bite? You may need the tooth adjusted to reduce stress. I recommend taking an X-ray. Consider getting an evaluation by an endodontist. This is a root canal specialist. I do not recommend restoring the tooth until it is comfortable. A hidden canal might exist or retreatment may be necessary. I do not recommend leaving the tooth in a temporary filling for a year. You risk fracture and it can continue to decay without causing pain. Plan to progress with a restoration. For back molars, I recommend a post and core with a crown. Sometimes, I place the post and core with plans to place the crown at a later time. Also, a temporary crown to prevent fracture, can be placed for a longer period of time to allow monitoring of the progression of healing with this tooth.

I took an inflammatory last night ang gargled the area with salt water.","Doctor":"Hello,I read your inquiry. You have done two important steps that I would recommend to my patients. Floss the area well and consider using an interdental cleaner or water pic (irrigation). Maintain good daily dental hygiene. You may still need to dislodge some food debris. Continue to rinse vigorously. Continue with anti-inflammatory medication as needed. The trauma of an injury from something hard could cause the inflammatory reaction. If the area does not feel better in two days, schedule a visit with your dentist to evaluate the area. You may disturb the tissue trying to clean it out and feel some soreness. The concern is an infection and need of prescription medication. I am concerned if the swelling continues to increase. If swelling or pain increase, do not delay scheduling a visit. Make sure to be on schedule for your routine dental exam and cleaning. It is possible that you have an underlying cause such as a tooth infection or periodontal disease. You may have been unaware and this episode has drawn your attention to the area that is now irritated. Thank you for your inquiry. I hope with my suggestions your discomfort will resolve anf you feel better soon."},{"Patient":"hi doctor ,i am naveena ,age 23, i had treated my tooth by putting tooth braces when i am 16 years old by removal of 4 teeth....  now i feel that need to put tooth braces again...as my teeth is not perfect.....but i have no space in between teeth.....is it possible for me to put tooth braces again.....if yes.....do they again remove my teeth for space?....please answer my query sir","Doctor":"Hello,Yes, you may have braces again. No, I would not suggest removing additional teeth.  You should consult with an orthodontist concerning your treatment options. You may need a simpler treatment in lenght to correct minor movement. If your bite relapsed due to not wearing a retainer or inadequate stabilization, then you may need full orthodontic treatment again. I would need more details on your appearance and jaw relationship to comment further.I encourage you to correct your bite.

Your diet, health, habits and medications contribute to the composition. Smoking, coffee and tea are examples of stain causing culprits. If you are not effective in getting your teeth clean, consider a professional cleaning. Consider changing dental product choices. Have a complete dental exam. I suspect a tooth with decay and the hole builds up with debris. Some bacteria can cause discoloration on your teeth as well. Your dentist can check for this and any oral infections present. Have you had a recent dental check up? Think of any recent changes that you can attribute to the timing of the build up. A dry mouth or gastric and sinus disorders can influence your mouth.Thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor(s), i've been diagnosed thru surgery having Chronic Hepatitis Auto Immune Disease.

Second, I recommend due to the climate you are living in, that you make sure you are very well hydrated. A dry mouth is very stressful on all oral tissues. You are well balanced with vitamins and no deficiencies? Consider updating your blood test results if you have not had lab work done in a while. Autoimmune changes to your blood and muscle tissue are a concern. Is this change unique to your tongue?Thank you for contacting Heallthcare Magic.

Follow regular good dental hygiene and maintain a soft diet. Take some anti- inflammatory medication such as Acetaminophen  or ibuprofen. If you experience temperature sensitivity, try toothpaste for sensitive teeth and home fluoride rinsing. Continue to watch the tooth. Trauma can cause nerve damage even months afterwards. Monitor for temperature and pressure sensitivity.  A periodic x-ray of the root can check for changes.Thank you for your inquiry.

Help","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for posting here.Your doctor is right.Teeth supra-erupt when the opposing tooth is missing.There are different forms of replacing a tooth.Implant is the most advanced technique amongst all.A bridge can be done if it is a first molar.A implant or a removable denture is the only choice if it is a second molar.Removable denture is considerably inconvinient and should be removed and placed after every meal and maintained.Implant includes a surgery in which your general health, cost factor must be considered.Removable denture is cheap and takes time to get used to it.Both these options prevent further growth of the opposite tooth.Consider these options and you can get it done.Replacing this tooth also increases your chewing ability.hope this helps."},{"Patient":"got injured by the cricket ball which hit on the lower lip, and lower lip is inflammated and there is a cut inside my lip which hit the tooth when hit by the ball. what should be the treatment, no bleeding now seems like a deep cut.

Just now, when I was walking around, I felt something in my mouth. Turned out to be a piece of tooth, I believe. Also, feels like a piece got down my throat. Is this something to worry about?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for posting here.This can be dislodged filling or broken tooth.If it is a broken filling, it must be redone.You must get it done immediately to prevent sensitivity and prevent further weakening of the tooth.If you broke your tooth,then a x-ray is necessary to assess if it is close to the pulp chamber.In that case, if it is close to the pulp, a root canal is necessary.Anyway, a x-ray must be done in case you broke your tooth.Do not chew on this tooth till you see your dentist.Check if you grind your teeth in the night.Dislodging of fillings is common in night grinding habit.If yes, you must get a soft splint to wear in the night.It will reduce the stress on the teeth you apply unknowingly.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello I am mukesh.

Your gum tissue was disturbed even with a simple extraction and blood loss can  contribute to dehydration.

If persists or worsens contact your dentist. Expect improvement in one week and should not continue over two weeks.

Any idea what we can do to prevent this? He is 30 years old and in good health (to our knowledge). I was wondering if dairy foods could cause this since that is the one food he seems to have a reaction to (mild bloating, etc. - doesn't seem to be complete lactose intollerance).  He flosses and brushes regularly and we have used several mouthwashes.","Doctor":"Hello,Gastric disturbances can cause bad breath in some instances. Lactose intolerance is not particularly assocoated with bad breath. Acid reflux can cause an acid feeling in the mouth and change the oral environment. Medications can cause dry mouth. Dehydration and breathing through your mouth can irritate oral tissue. Plaque becomes more difficult to remove. Be sure to brush the tongue as a coating on the tongue can create an odor. Tonsil stones, located in back of the throat, are another possibility. Sinus congestion with post nasal drip can contribute as well.The most likely cause and first area of evaluation should be your oral health. A routine dental exam will rule out active areas of decay, abscess and periodontal conditions that need to be addressed. Evaluation of your oral hygiene and instruction on proper oral care will include an evaluation for bad breath. Some additional basic techniques may be recommended. The most typical cause of persistant bad breath is buildup of bacteria in the mouth. First rule this out. A thorough cleaning is needed and tartar removed. Even with daily home care, there may be tartar undeer the gums if you have not had a recent dental cleaning.Diet and chemicals can contribute to bad breath. Once in the blood stream, with blood traveling to the lungs, your breath can be effected. The smell of garlic, spicy foods and alcoholic can be obvious on the breath of people who have recently consumed these. This type of bad breath is temporary and easily controlled with a diet change. Avoid certain foods if you suspect this to be the cause. Smoking and the body breaking down medications including vitamins may contribute. Make your diet is balanced. Deficiencies or excess viamins and minerals should be avoided. Keep well hydrated for your entire body systems to function properly.Even a dietary change or fasting can cause an unhealthy sweet breath. This can be due to chemicals called ketones being expelled. They are made by the breakdown of fat. Diabetes can be suspected with this symptom and may warrent further evaluation by your physician.A fishy type odor, from the syndrome trimethylaminuria, is possible due to the inability to properly break down trimethylamine which is found in certain foods. There may be a build-up of trimethylamine in the body which can be released in your breath. Urine and blood tests are suggested help to confirm this diagnosis if it is suspected. This may be noticed in sweat and urine as well. This is not a common condition.I thank you for your inquiry and hope you find my suggestions helpful to assist you with an answer and solution."},{"Patient":"hi ! doc  i have been precscired by my doctor to have  clavam 625 as i have dental problem my tooth which has a filling is  has become very sensitive  and a pit of pain on the cheeks i cant drink hot or cold drinks or water  i can eat  pls do reply is it the correct medication and will it work out for me ? neeshaa","Doctor":"hello thanks for consulting at hcm..Below the filling there may be occurence of secondary caries, resulting in pulp involvement,, since pain is there infection must have spread to periapical region hence sensitive and severe pain in the cheek,,hence your dentist has prescribed clavam 625mg which is antibiotics and you also may need analgesics also ,,plz get it under the guidance of your dentist.. and also get a iopa radiograph for the involved tooth,, after that you may need root canal treatment for that tooth,, hope it helps,,take care,,"},{"Patient":"Two days ago i was at the dentist having a filling replaced. it was a large filling and the dentist had to use additional novacaine.

I have a dentist appt. monday morning, I just want to make sure that thats whats going on?? I started on amoxicillan, today.??? please tell Im not going to die....","Doctor":"Hello,You describe the symptoms of a badly decayed tooth that has abscessed. You should take an antibiotic by prescription from your dentist. I usually prescribe amoxicillin to control the inflammation and spread of infection. Patients of record, can ask for a prescription to be called into the pharmacy. You need to be taking the correct dose and at specific time intervals. Anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen may reduce symptoms. The anti-histamine Benadryl is another anti-inflammatory medication to consider. Infections, especially for upper teeth, can affect the sinus cavity and cause drainage. Aggressive infections can create pathways threw bone for drainage. This release of fliud rather than a build up of pressure is most likely why the tooth was not really painful. The fluid is also acidic.Your tooth is necrotic and does not have a healthy nerve to react, but the spread of the infection has caused drainage. Encourage the area to drain. Rinsing with warm salt water and gently massaging the area is recommended. You must evaluate the tooth for restorability. As long as you have enough healthy tooth structure, you can have a root canal, post and replace the crown. The alternative treatment is an extraction. Your periodontal health must be evaluated as well. You must complete treatment for the source of the infection. Infections can spread into your blood system if left untreated. You have an appointment and should have a good, non life threatening, result with your attention to your abscess.Thank you for your inquiry. I am glad to answer additional questions."},{"Patient":"My son is 7 years old and has had a bump on his upper gums (under his lip, right above his tooth) for the last 3-4 months.
