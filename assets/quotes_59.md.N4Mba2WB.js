This is because the sum of the digits of a number is congruent to the number itself modulo 9.2. Applying the Property to ( N ):   We need to find ( 4444^{4444} mod 9 ).

Thus, the coordinates of point P are (1, 1).To find the equation of the tangent line, we use the point-slope form of a line, which is y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), where m is the slope and (x_1, y_1) is a point on the line.

Understanding the Problem:   - We need to determine the maximum number of edges of a regular dodecahedron that a plane can intersect, given that the plane does not pass through any vertex of the dodecahedron.2. Properties of a Regular Dodecahedron:   - A regular dodecahedron has 12 faces, each of which is a regular pentagon.   - It has 20 vertices and 30 edges.3. Plane Intersection with the Dodecahedron:   - Consider a plane passing through the barycenter (center of mass) of the dodecahedron.   - If the plane is parallel to two opposite faces, it will intersect the remaining 10 faces.4. Counting the Intersected Edges:   - Each face of the dodecahedron is a pentagon, and a plane intersecting a pentagon can intersect at most 5 edges.   - However, since the plane is parallel to two opposite faces, it will not intersect these two faces.   - Therefore, the plane intersects the remaining 10 faces.5. Edge Intersection Calculation:   - For each of the 10 intersected faces, the plane can intersect up to 5 edges.   - However, each edge belongs to two faces, so we must avoid double-counting the edges.   - Thus, the maximum number of edges the plane can intersect is given by:     [     frac{10 times 5}{2} = 25     ]   - This calculation is incorrect because it overestimates the number of intersected edges. The correct approach is to consider the specific configuration of the plane and the dodecahedron.6. Correct Configuration:   - A plane passing through the barycenter and parallel to two opposite faces will intersect the edges of the remaining 10 faces.   - Each of these 10 faces will contribute exactly one edge to the intersection, as the plane will intersect each face along a line segment that cuts through one edge of the pentagon.7.

Neither a-b nor a+b could equal 25 or 75 , because if they did, then one of a and b is odd, while the other is even, so their squares can't end in the same digit.

(40 points) Among nine visually identical gold coins, one weighs a, seven weigh b, and the last one weighs c, and a < b < c. Using a balance scale, find the minimum number of weighings required to identify the coin weighing a and the coin weighing c.To solve this problem, we need to devise a strategy to identify the coins with weights a and c using the fewest number of weighings. Here is a step-by-step approach:1. First Weighing:   - Divide the nine coins into three groups of three coins each: Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3.   - Weigh Group 1 against Group 2.   Case 1: If Group 1 and Group 2 balance, then the coin weighing a and the coin weighing c must be in Group 3.   - Weigh two coins from Group 3 against each other.     - If they balance, the remaining coin in Group 3 is the one weighing c.     - If they do not balance, the lighter coin is the one weighing a and the heavier coin is the one weighing c.   Case 2: If Group 1 and Group 2 do not balance, then the coin weighing a and the coin weighing c are in the lighter and heavier groups, respectively.   - Identify the lighter group (Group 1 or Group 2) and the heavier group (Group 1 or Group 2).   - Weigh two coins from the lighter group against each other.     - If they balance, the remaining coin in the lighter group is the one weighing a.     - If they do not balance, the lighter coin is the one weighing a.   - Weigh two coins from the heavier group against each other.     - If they balance, the remaining coin in the heavier group is the one weighing c.     - If they do not balance, the heavier coin is the one weighing c.In both cases, we can identify the coins weighing a and c in a minimum of 2 weighings.Thus, the minimum number of weighings required is (boxed{2}).","solution":"9. Solution 1: First, label the nine coins asA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I.Weigh (A, B, C, D) against (E, F, G, H). If they balance, then a+c=2b. If they do not balance, assume without loss of generality that (A, B, C, D) > (E, F, G, H).For the second weighing, weigh (A, B) against (C, D) and (E, F) against (G, H). At this point, there are four possible scenarios:(1) (A, B) > (C, D) and (E, F) > (G, H). Then the heavy coin is in (A, B), and the light coin can only be in (G, H). For the fourth weighing, place (A, B, G, H) on one side and (C, D, E, F) on the other side. The lightness or heaviness or balance of (A, B, G, H) side indicates whether a+c is lighter, heavier, or equal to 2b.(2) (A, B) > (C, D) and (E, F) = (G, H). Then the heavy coin is in (A, B), and the light coin can only be in (C, D, I).If the light coin is in (C, D), then it is already known that a+c > 2b. For the fourth weighing, place (A, B, I) on one side and (E, F, G) on the other side. The lightness or heaviness of the (A, B, I) side indicates whether a+c is lighter or heavier than 2b.(3) (A, B) = (C, D) and (E, F) > (G, H). Then the light coin is in (G, H), and the heavy coin can only be in (E, F, I). If the heavy coin is in (E, F), then it is already known that a+c < 2b. For the fourth weighing, place (A, B, C) on one side and (G, H, I) on the other side. The lightness or heaviness or balance of the (G, H, I) side indicates whether a+c is lighter, heavier, or equal to 2b.(4) If both weighings are unbalanced, assume (A, B) > (C, D) and (E, F) > (G, H). For the third weighing, compare (A, B) with (G, H). If they balance, then the fake coins are in (C, D, E, F). For the fourth weighing, compare (A, B, G, H) with (C, D, E, F). The lightness or heaviness or balance of the (C, D, E, F) side indicates whether a+c is lighter, heavier, or equal to 2b; if they do not balance, then the fake coins are in (A, B, G, H). For the fourth weighing, compare (A, B, G, H) with (C, D, E, F). The lightness or heaviness or balance of the (A, B, G, H) side indicates whether a+c is lighter, heavier, or equal to 2b. (For the third weighing, compare (A, B) with (E, F) (or symmetrically (C, D) with (G, H)). The heavier side contains the fake heavy coin, and the other side contains the real coins, thus identifying the location of the light coin.)In summary, four weighings are sufficient to determine the result."},{"problem":"Given that α-β= dfrac {π}{3}, and cos α+cos β= dfrac {1}{5}, find the value of cos dfrac {α+β}{2}.","solution":"Since α-β= dfrac {π}{3}, we can apply the sum-to-product identity for cosine:cos α+cos β=2cos dfrac {α+β}{2}cos dfrac {α-β}{2}=2cos dfrac {α+β}{2}cdotcos dfrac {π}{6}= dfrac {1}{5}Solving for cos dfrac {α+β}{2}, we get:cos dfrac {α+β}{2}= dfrac{sqrt{3}}{15}Therefore, the answer is: boxed{dfrac{sqrt{3}}{15}}.We used the given condition and the sum-to-product identity to find the value of cos dfrac {α+β}{2}.

The distance from the origin to the line ( x + y = c ) is given by:   [   frac{|c|}{sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}} = frac{|c|}{sqrt{2}}   ]   Setting this equal to 1 (the radius of the circle), we get:   [   frac{|c|}{sqrt{2}} = 1 implies |c| = sqrt{2}   ]   Therefore, ( c = sqrt{2} ) or ( c = -sqrt{2} ).5. Find the points of intersection: The lines ( x + y = sqrt{2} ) and ( x + y = -sqrt{2} ) intersect the circle at:   [   x + y = sqrt{2} quad text{and} quad x^2 + y^2 = 1   ]   Solving these simultaneously, we substitute ( y = sqrt{2} - x ) into ( x^2 + y^2 = 1 ):   [   x^2 + (sqrt{2} - x)^2 = 1   ]   [   x^2 + 2 - 2sqrt{2}x + x^2 = 1   ]   [   2x^2 - 2sqrt{2}x + 2 = 1   ]   [   2x^2 - 2sqrt{2}x + 1 = 0   ]   Solving this quadratic equation:   [   x = frac{2sqrt{2} pm sqrt{(2sqrt{2})^2 - 4 cdot 2 cdot 1}}{2 cdot 2}   ]   [   x = frac{2sqrt{2} pm sqrt{8 - 8}}{4}   ]   [   x = frac{2sqrt{2}}{4} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}   ]   Thus, ( x = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ) and ( y = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ).6. Verify the points: Similarly, for ( x + y = -sqrt{2} ), we get the points ( x = -frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ) and ( y = -frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ).7. Determine maximum and minimum: Evaluating ( f(x,y) ) at these points:   [   fleft( frac{1}{sqrt{2}}, frac{1}{sqrt{2}} right) = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} + frac{1}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2}   ]   [   fleft( -frac{1}{sqrt{2}}, -frac{1}{sqrt{2}} right) = -frac{1}{sqrt{2}} - frac{1}{sqrt{2}} = -sqrt{2}   ]   Therefore, the maximum value of ( f(x,y) ) is ( sqrt{2} ) at the point ( left( frac{1}{sqrt{2}}, frac{1}{sqrt{2}} right) ).The final answer is ( boxed{ left( frac{1}{sqrt{2}}, frac{1}{sqrt{2}} right) } )."},{"problem":"Calculate the probability of randomly selecting an element from the set {x mid x=frac{npi}{5}, n=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} that satisfies the inequality tan{x} > 0.","solution":"The given set is left{frac{pi}{5}, frac{2pi}{5}, frac{3pi}{5}, frac{4pi}{5}, pi, frac{6pi}{5}, frac{7pi}{5}, frac{8pi}{5}right}.To determine the probability that a randomly chosen element satisfies tan{x} > 0, we must consider the sign of the tangent function in each interval between the multiples of frac{pi}{5}:- tanleft(frac{pi}{5}right) > 0, since frac{pi}{5} is in the first quadrant where the tangent is positive.- tanleft(frac{2pi}{5}right) > 0, this is still in the first quadrant.- tanleft(frac{3pi}{5}right)  0, now in the third quadrant, the tangent is positive.- tanleft(frac{7pi}{5}right) > 0, still in the third quadrant.- tanleft(frac{8pi}{5}right)  0 is p = frac{4}{8} = frac{1}{2}.[p = frac{text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{text{Total number of outcomes}} = frac{4}{8} = boxed{frac{1}{2}}.]"},{"problem":"Three.

Define the sequence b_n:   Let b_n = 2a_n - a_{n-1} for n ge 1. This transformation will help us analyze the properties of the sequence {a_n}.2. Analyze the distinctness modulo n:   According to condition (4), for every n ge 2, the set {2a_i - a_{i-1} mid i = 1, 2, 3, ldots, n} is congruent to {0, 1, 2, ldots, n-1} pmod{n}. This implies that b_i notequiv b_j pmod{n} for all 1 le i < j le n.3. Initial values:   Given a_0 = 0 and a_1 = 1, we can compute b_1:   [   b_1 = 2a_1 - a_0 = 2 cdot 1 - 0 = 2   ]4. Bound on b_n:   Since b_i notequiv b_j pmod{n} for all 1 le i < j le n, the values b_i must be distinct modulo n. This implies that b_i can take values from 0 to n-1 modulo n. Therefore, b_n leq n + 1.5. Contradiction if b_k < k + 1:   Suppose there exists some k such that b_k < k + 1. This would imply that a_n < n for all n > k, which contradicts condition (3) that states a_m = m for infinitely many m.6. Conclusion for b_n:   Since b_n cannot be less than n + 1 without contradicting condition (3), we must have b_n = n + 1 for all n.7. Solve for a_n:   Using the definition b_n = 2a_n - a_{n-1}, we have:   [   n + 1 = 2a_n - a_{n-1}   ]   Rearranging, we get:   [   2a_n = n + 1 + a_{n-1}   ]   [   a_n = frac{n + 1 + a_{n-1}}{2}   ]8. Verify the solution:   We need to check if a_n = n satisfies all conditions:   - For a_0 = 0 and a_1 = 1, it holds.   - For a_n = n, we have b_n = 2n - (n-1) = n + 1, which matches our derived b_n.   - Condition (3) is satisfied as a_m = m for infinitely many m.   - Condition (4) is satisfied as {2a_i - a_{i-1} mid i = 1, 2, 3, ldots, n} = {2i - (i-1) mid i = 1, 2, 3, ldots, n} = {i + 1 mid i = 1, 2, 3, ldots, n} equiv {0, 1, 2, ldots, n-1} pmod{n}.Thus, the unique solution is a_n = n.The final answer is boxed{a_n = n}."},{"problem":"1703.

We distinguish four cases based on the position of the points A_{i} and A_{i+1}. If the point A_{i+1} was in the original red part and A_{i} is in the rotated red part, then r_{i}=r_{i+1}. If the point A_{i+1} was in the original red part and A_{i} is not in the rotated red part, the number of points in the red part has decreased by 1, so r_{i+1}=r_{i}-1. Suppose that A_{i+1} was not in the original red part. If A_{i} is not in the new red part, then r_{i+1}=r_{i}, otherwise r_{i+1}=r_{i}+1.In each step, the number of red points changes by at most 1. All numbers are integers. Initially, there were r_{1} points in the red part, and after 2 n+1 rotations, we return to the situation where the red part borders the line A A_{1}, but on the opposite side of the line A A_{1} as it was initially. Therefore, the number of points in the red part at the end is 2 n-r_{1}. If r_{1}=n, then the line A A_{1} is a separator. Otherwise, one of the numbers r_{1} or 2 n-r_{1} is greater than n, and the other is less than n. During the rotation of the red part, the numbers r_{i} change by 1, which means there is a step where r_{i}=n. The corresponding line A A_{i} is then a separator.We have shown that there is a separator through each point. Since there are 2 n+2 points, we get 2 n+2 lines, each counted twice (once for each point that lies on it). Thus, there are always at least frac{2 n+2}{2}=n+1 separators."},{"problem":"Provide an example of a quadratic trinomial P(x) such that for any x the equality P(x)+P(x+1)+cdots+P(x+10)=x^{2} holds.","solution":"Let the desired polynomial be P(x)=a x^{2}+b x+c.

All possible outcomes of the experiment considered in this problem consist in the first person arriving at some moment of time x between 12 o'clock and 1 o'clock and the second person arriving at another moment of time y within the same interval. Thus, these outcomes are determined by a pair of numbers x, y, where 0 leqslant x leqslant 1 and 0 leqslant y leqslant 1. Considering these numbers as coordinates of a point on the plane, we can represent the set of all outcomes as the set of points of the square O A B C with side 1 (Fig. 79). Since x and y are chosen randomly between 12 o'clock and 1 o'clock, the probability that x (respectively y) falls within any interval on the x-axis (respectively y-axis) is equal to the length of this interval (recall that in our case O A=O C=1). Therefore, the probability that the point (x, y) falls within any rectangle inside O A B C is equal to the area of this rectangle.

Find the least nin Z_+, for which every set of n perfect squares not divisible by p contains nonempty subset with product of all it's elements equal to 1 (text{mod} p)","solution":"1. Base Case for ( p = 3 ):   - For ( p = 3 ), the conclusion is straightforward. We can take a one-element subset since any perfect square modulo 3 is either 0 or 1. Since we are considering perfect squares not divisible by ( p ), the only possible residue is 1. Thus, any single perfect square will satisfy the condition.2. General Case for ( p > 3 ):   - We need to find the smallest ( n ) such that any set of ( n ) perfect squares not divisible by ( p ) contains a nonempty subset whose product is congruent to 1 modulo ( p ).3. Inductive Step:   - Suppose we can find the required subset for any ( n ) perfect squares. Then, we can also find it for ( n+1 ) perfect squares. Conversely, if it is impossible for ( n ) perfect squares, it will also be impossible for ( n-1 ) perfect squares. Therefore, it suffices to show that for a certain set of ( frac{p-1}{2} - 1 ) perfect squares, the choice is impossible, but for any set of ( frac{p-1}{2} ) perfect squares, the choice exists.4. Proof for ( frac{p-1}{2} - 1 ) Perfect Squares:   - Consider the set of ( frac{p-1}{2} - 1 ) perfect squares, all being ( 2^2 ). Since ( p mid 2^{p-1} - 1 ) (by Fermat's Little Theorem), we cannot have ( p mid 2^{p-3} - 1 ) because it would imply ( p mid 3 ), which is a contradiction for ( p > 3 ). Hence, ( 2^{2 cdot left(frac{p-1}{2} - 1right)} ) is not divisible by ( p ).5. Proof for ( frac{p-1}{2} ) Perfect Squares:   - Consider the set ( { x_1^2, x_2^2, ldots, x_n^2 } ) where ( x_i in mathbb{Z} ) and ( n = frac{p-1}{2} ). Assume, for contradiction, that it is impossible to find the required subset. The numbers ( x_1^2, (x_1 x_2)^2, ldots, (x_1 x_2 cdot ldots cdot x_n)^2 ) do not give residues 0 or 1 modulo ( p ) (by the problem's assumption and our contrary assumption).6. Application of the Pigeonhole Principle:   - For ( p > 2 ), there are ( frac{p-1}{2} - 1 ) quadratic residues modulo ( p ) different from 0 and 1. By the pigeonhole principle, there exist ( k, l in mathbb{Z} ) with ( 1 le k < l le n ) such that ( p mid (x_1 cdots x_k)^2 - (x_1 cdots x_l)^2 = (x_1 cdots x_l)^2 ((x_{l+1} cdots x_k)^2 - 1) ). Since the numbers ( x_i ) are not divisible by ( p ), it follows that ( p mid (x_{l+1} cdots x_k)^2 - 1 ), which contradicts our contrary assumption.Therefore, the least ( n ) for which every set of ( n ) perfect squares not divisible by ( p ) contains a nonempty subset with a product equal to 1 modulo ( p ) is ( frac{p-1}{2} ).The final answer is ( boxed{frac{p-1}{2}} )."},{"problem":"1.

The existence of points A and B is guaranteed by the problem's conditions, and it is also assumed that the points O_{i} are on one side of the line AB. We also assume that A is outside k_{3} and B is outside k_{2}, otherwise there would be nothing to prove.# 1985-05-206-1. eps ## 1. Figure1. The centers O_{i} are generally not on the same line, in which case A and B are different. We first consider such a situation, and our proof will be based on the configuration shown in Figure 1.According to the statement, the center of the circle in question can only be the intersection point M of the angle bisectors of the angles formed by the tangent pairs a_{1}, a_{2} and b_{1}, b_{2}. Therefore, a circle can be drawn around M that is tangent to the line pair a_{1}, a_{2} and another circle that is tangent to the line pair b_{1}, b_{2}. Let the radii of these circles be varrho_{a} and varrho_{b}, respectively. The statement of the problem means that these radii are equal. We want to show that varrho_{a} = varrho_{b} for the point M on the figure.We apply Menelaus' theorem to the triangle O_{1} O_{3} A and the transversal line O_{2} B, which intersects the line segment O_{3} A at M:frac{A O_{2}}{O_{2} O_{1}} cdot frac{O_{1} B}{B O_{3}} cdot frac{O_{3} M}{M A} = -1Here, each segment is the distance from a circle center to a similarity center or the difference of two such distances, so the ratios can be expressed in terms of the corresponding radii. Taking into account the directions,begin{aligned}& frac{A O_{2}}{O_{2} O_{1}} = frac{A O_{2}}{A O_{1} - A O_{2}} = frac{r_{2}}{r_{1} - r_{2}} & frac{O_{1} B}{B O_{3}} = -frac{B O_{1}}{B O_{3}} = -frac{r_{1}}{r_{3}} & frac{O_{3} M}{M A} = frac{M O_{3}}{A M} = frac{A O_{3} - A M}{A M} = frac{r_{3}}{varrho_{a}} - 1end{aligned}since, with respect to the center A, the circle with radius varrho_{a} is in a similar position to k_{3}.Substituting these,left(frac{r_{2}}{r_{1} - r_{2}}right) cdot left(-frac{r_{1}}{r_{3}}right) cdot left(frac{r_{3}}{varrho_{a}} - 1right) = -1which simplifies tovarrho_{a} = frac{r_{1} r_{2} r_{3}}{r_{1}(r_{2} + r_{3}) - r_{2} r_{3}}We could similarly calculate the radius varrho_{b}, using the fact that the circles with radii varrho_{b} and r_{2} are similar with respect to the center B. We would apply Menelaus' theorem to the triangle O_{1} O_{2} B and the line O_{3} A. This would be a reflection of the roles, with O_{2} and O_{3}, and thus r_{2} and r_{3}, swapping places, and A being replaced by B, or the center of the pair of circles k_{1}, k_{2} being replaced by the center of the pair k_{1}, k_{3}. Both changes imply that we could obtain varrho_{b} from the formula for varrho_{a} by swapping the indices 2 and 3.However, in the formula, r_{2} and r_{3} play a symmetric role, appearing as their product and sum. Therefore, varrho_{a} = varrho_{b}. This completes the proof and provides the desired expression for the radius.2. If O_{1}, O_{2}, and O_{3} are on a line t, then it is possible that A and B coincide. In this case, the two common tangents of the three circles would serve the role of the four tangents mentioned in the problem; the statement would be trivial.If A and B are different but on the line t, then the tangent pairs a_{1}, a_{2} and b_{1}, b_{2} are reflections of each other across t, forming a deltoid, and the validity of the statement is obvious (Figure 2). The formula for the radius of the circle M is valid.## 1985-05-207-1. eps2. FigureRemarks. 1. If we not only use the fact that the intersection point of the common external tangents is the external similarity point of the pair of circles in the proof, but also state it in the problem, then the statement can be extended in several ways. Essentially, we are dealing with a special case of a family of theorems. This is understandable given that it is a competition problem, where it is customary to \\"overstate\\" the topic with stronger conditions, leaving only the \\"essentials\\" to be mentioned. One reason is to ensure that contestants have time for other problems; another is to allow those who have additional insights to demonstrate their analytical and discussion skills, as well as their expertise. - Of course, here too, only a few possibilities can be mentioned.We did not use the fact that the circles are pairwise disjoint, e.g., that O_{1} O_{2} > r_{1} + r_{2}, since the radius of the fourth circle in the statement's expression does not involve the distances between the centers. Fixing the lengths of the radii r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, the radius of the fourth circle is the same in all possible configurations of the circles.The external similarity point exists even if, for example, k_{2} contains k_{1} (!); it is the point where the lines connecting the endpoints of parallel and unidirectional radii meet, if r_{1} neq r_{2}. Similarly, there is something to say about the case r_{1} = r_{2}. However, similar statements are valid for internal similarity points as well, i.e., when the endpoints of parallel and oppositely directed radii are used to derive the points A and B.However, this must be added to the proof: in Figure 1, we focused on the \\"most obvious\\" point M, the intersection of the angle bisectors of segments A O_{3} and B O_{2}. In the calculation, we used the fact that O_{2} O_{1} = A O_{1} - A O_{2} and M O_{3} = A O_{3} - A M. Among the four intersection points of the angle bisectors of the tangent pairs a_{1}, a_{2} and b_{1}, b_{2}, only this one satisfies the calculation and the statement.In Figure 2, due to symmetry, the radius of the middle circle M^{*} depends on the positions of the centers.2. Several people proved the statement of the problem using the \\"conic\\" method, which is typically used to prove that 3 out of 6 external and internal similarity points of 3 circles lie on a straight line.

Since point P is on the hyperbola C, and point Q is on the asymptote of C with both points in the first quadrant, and overrightarrow{QP} = overrightarrow{PF_2} and overrightarrow{QF_1} cdot overrightarrow{QF_2} = 0, we know that P is the midpoint of Q and F_2, and that overrightarrow{QF_1} is perpendicular to overrightarrow{QF_2}.

This is because all terms involving x will become zero, and we will be left with the constant term a_0 on the right-hand side. So, substituting x=0, we get:1 + 1^2 + 1^3 + cdots + 1^n = a_0Since 1^k = 1 for any k, the left-hand side simply becomes n (because we are summing n ones). Therefore, we have:a_0 = n2. Finding n when a_3=35:To find the coefficient a_3, we need to understand that it comes from the expansion of (1+x)^k for k=3 to n. The term x^3 in the expansion of (1+x)^k is given by the binomial coefficient C_k^3. Therefore, a_3 is the sum of these coefficients from k=3 to n:a_3 = C_3^3 + C_4^3 + C_5^3 + cdots + C_n^3Using the property of binomial coefficients, we can simplify this sum step by step:a_3 = C_4^4 + C_4^3 + C_5^3 + cdots + C_n^3 = C_5^4 + C_5^3 + cdots + C_n^3 = cdots = C_n^4 + C_n^3This simplification uses the identity C_{k+1}^{r+1} = C_k^r + C_k^{r+1}, which allows us to combine terms iteratively until we reach C_n^4 + C_n^3. This sum can be further simplified using Pascal's rule to C_{n+1}^4.Given that a_3 = 35, we have:C_{n+1}^4 = 35The binomial coefficient C_{n+1}^4 represents the number of ways to choose 4 items out of (n+1), and it is calculated as:C_{n+1}^4 = frac{(n+1)n(n-1)(n-2)}{4!} = 35Solving this equation for n:frac{(n+1)n(n-1)(n-2)}{4×3×2×1} = 35This equation simplifies to a quartic equation in n.

There are exactly frac{3000}{2}=1500 even numbers from 1 to 3000, frac{3000}{3}=1000 numbers divisible by 3, and frac{3000}{5}=600 numbers divisible by 5. However, if we simply add the numbers 1500, 1000, and 600, we will count some numbers twice, specifically, numbers divisible by 2 cdot 3=6, 2 cdot 5=10, and 3 cdot 5=15. Therefore, we need to subtract frac{3000}{6}=500, frac{3000}{10}=300, and frac{3000}{15}=200 from the sum. However, 1500+1000+600-500-300-200=2100 is still incorrect. Since in this expression, numbers that have all three prime factors are counted three times and then subtracted three times, we need to add these numbers again. The number of such numbers is frac{3000}{2 cdot 3 cdot 5}=100, so the number of numbers that have common divisors with 3000 and do not exceed it is 2200.Notice now that if a number x has common divisors with a number N, then the number N-x also has the same common divisors with N. Therefore, all the numbers of interest, except for the numbers 1500 and 3000, can be paired with a sum of 3000 (the number 3000 would have to be paired with 0, and the number 1500 with itself).

Let's look at the equation modulo 8. The right side gives a remainder of 4 when divided by 8. On the other hand, if both numbers a and b were greater than or equal to 4, then the left side would be divisible by 8, which leads to a contradiction. Therefore, a leqslant 3 or b leqslant 3.Since a and b are even, we need to check the cases a=2 and b=2.1) If a=2, the equation reduces to:begin{aligned}2^{b}-b^{2}+4 & =17 cdot 16-2 b^{2}+52 2^{b}+b^{2} & =320end{aligned}For b=8, we get equality and one solution (a, b)=(2,8).1 pointThe left side of the equation increases as b increases, so for all b different from 8, the equality does not hold, and we have no more solutions.2) If b=2, the equation reduces to:begin{aligned}a^{2}-2^{a}+2^{a} & =17 a^{4}-2 cdot 4+52 17 a^{4}-a^{2}+44 & =0end{aligned}Since for all natural numbers a, a^{4} geqslant a^{2}, the left side of the equation is clearly strictly greater than zero, so this equation has no natural solutions.Now assume that a is an odd number. Again, look at the equation modulo 8. Since the square of an odd number gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 8, the right side gives a remainder of 5. On the other hand, if a were greater than or equal to 3, then for the same reason, the left side would give a remainder of 1 when divided by 8, which again leads to a contradiction. Therefore, a leqslant 2.Since a is odd, the only possibility is a=1.

This makes a_{0} equal to the value of x^4 when x= frac{1}{2}:a_{0}= left(frac{1}{2}right)^{4} = frac{1}{2^{4}}Expanding x^{4}=left(frac{1}{2}(2x-1+1)right)^{4} using the Binomial Theorem gives:x^{4} = frac{1}{2^{4}}left[(2x-1)+1right]^{4} = a_{0}+a_{1}(2x-1)+a_{2}(2x-1)^{2}+a_{3}(2x-1)^{3}+a_{4}(2x-1)^{4}To find the coefficient a_{2}, we look at the term corresponding to (2x-1)^{2} in the binomial expansion. The coefficient of this term is frac{1}{2^{4}} cdot binom{4}{2}. Hence:a_{2}= frac{1}{2^{4}} cdot binom{4}{2} = frac{6}{16} = frac{3}{8}So the correct choice is boxed{C}."},{"problem":"[Graph Theory (Miscellaneous)]Several Top Secret Objects are connected by an underground railway in such a way that each Object is directly connected to no more than three others, and from each Object, it is possible to reach any other by underground travel with no more than one transfer.

Therefore, the equation x^{2}-(m+3)x+m+1=0 always has two distinct real roots, as Delta > 0.# Part (2): Finding the Perimeter of the Isosceles TriangleGiven that one root of the equation is 4, we substitute x = 4 into the equation to find m:[4^{2} - (m+3)(4) + m + 1 = 0]Solving for m:[16 - 4m - 12 + m + 1 = 0 5 = 3m m = frac{5}{3}]Substituting m = frac{5}{3} into the original equation, we get:[3x^{2} - 14x + 8 = 0]Given that one root is 4, we find the other root by solving the equation. The roots are x = 4 and x = frac{2}{3}. Since the roots represent the lengths of the sides of an isosceles triangle, and one side is 4, the other equal side must also be 4, and the base is frac{2}{3}.Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is:[P = 4 + 4 + frac{2}{3} = frac{26}{3}]Hence, the perimeter of the isosceles triangle is boxed{frac{26}{3}}."},{"problem":"2.

Therefore, the required positive integer ( n geqslant 7 ).Second, if there exist 7 points in a plane (where no three points are collinear), such that all triangles formed by these 7 points are isosceles triangles. Let the set of these 7 points be ( E ).Assume the two farthest points in ( E ) are ( A ) and ( B ). Draw arcs centered at ( A ) and ( B ) with radius ( AB ), intersecting at points ( M ) and ( N ).Let ( l_{1} = overparen{M A N} cup sqrt{M B N} ), ( l_{2} = ) line segment ( M N ).Take any ( P in E, P neq A, P neq B ), then ( triangle P A B ) is an isosceles triangle. Thus, at least one of the following three cases holds: (1) ( P A = P B leqslant A B ); (2) ( P A = A B geqslant P B ); (3) ( P B = A B geqslant P A ), so ( P in l_{1} cup l_{2} ).Since no two points in ( E ) are collinear, at most 2 points of ( E ) can lie on ( l_{2} ), thus at least ( 7 - 2 - 2 = 3 ) points of ( E ) lie on ( overparen{A M} ), ( overparen{B M} ), ( overparen{A N} ), ( overparen{B N} ) (excluding endpoints).Assume ( overparen{B N} ) has one point ( C ) of ( E ) (where ( C neq B, C neq N )), and there are no points of ( E ) inside ( B C ). Draw arcs centered at ( A ) and ( C ) with radius ( A C = A B ), intersecting at points ( M' ) and ( N' ).Let ( l_{3} = overparen{M' A N'} cup widetilde{M' C N} ), ( l_{4} = ) line segment ( M' N' ). Similarly, all points of ( E ) belong to ( l_{3} cup l_{4} ). So ( {O} cup {T} cup {R} ), where ( O ) is the intersection of ( l_{2} ) and ( l_{4} ), ( T ) is the intersection of ( l_{2} ) and ( overparen{M A} ), ( R ) is the intersection of ( l_{1} ) and ( overparen{A N} ).Let ( S_{1} = overparen{M' B} cup {T} ), ( S_{2} = overparen{C N} cup {R} ), then ( S_{1} cup S_{2} ) has at least ( 7 - 3 - 1 = 3 ) points of ( E ) different from ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ).

Assume ( S_{2} ) has 2 points ( P ) and ( Q ) of ( E ) different from ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ), then there are only the following two cases.(1) ( P in overparen{C N} ), ( Q in overparen{C N} ) (as shown in Figure a). Since ( triangle P B C ) is an isosceles triangle and ( P B > B C ), we have ( P C = B C ). Similarly, from ( triangle Q B C ) being an isosceles triangle, we get ( Q C = B C ). Therefore, ( C P = C Q ), meaning ( C ) lies on the perpendicular bisector of ( P Q ), but the perpendicular bisector of ( P Q ) only passes through ( A ) and not ( C ), which is a contradiction.(2) ( P in overparen{C N} ), ( Q = R ) (as shown in Figure b), similarly we get ( P C = B C ).Also, ( triangle R B C ) is an isosceles triangle, and ( B R = B N > B C ), so ( R C = B C ), thus ( R C = P C = B C ).

But since their product is three times a square, one of them must be a square and the other three times a square. We cannot have 2n - 1 be three times a square, for then 2n + 1 would be a square congruent to 2 modulo 3, which is impossible.Thus 2n - 1 is a square, say b^2. But 2n + 79 is also a square, say a^2. Then (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 = 80. Since a + b and a - b have the same parity and their product is even, they are both even. To maximize n, it suffices to maximize 2b = (a + b) - (a - b) and check that this yields an integral value for m. This occurs when a + b = 40 and a - b = 2, that is, when a = 21 and b = 19. This yields n = 181 and m = 104, so the answer is boxed{181}.Solution 2Suppose that the consecutive cubes are m and m + 1.

However, a is even and b is odd. It is easy to see that the parity of a and b switch each time (by induction). Hence all solutions to the first condition are in the form:[(2 + sqrt {3})^{2k + 1} = a_k + sqrt {3}b_k]where k = 0,1,2,... So we can (with very little effort) obtain the following: (k,a_k = 2n) = (0,2),(1,26),(2,362),(3,5042). It is an AIME problem so it is implicit that n < 1000, so 2n < 2000. It is easy to see that a_n is strictly increasing by induction. Checking 2n = 362implies n =boxed{181} in the second condition works (we know b_k is odd so we don't need to find m). So we're done.Solution 3 (Big Bash)Let us generate numbers 1 to 1000 for the second condition, for squares. We know for N to be integer, the squares must be odd. So we generate N = 1, 21, 45, 73, 105, 141, 181, 381, 441, 721, 801. N cannot exceed 1000 since it is AIME problem. Now take the first criterion, let a be the smaller consecutive cube. We then get:N^2 = (A + 1)^3 - A^3N^2 - 1 = 3A^2 + 3A(N + 1)(N - 1) = 3A(A + 1)Now we know either N + 1 or N - 1 must be factor of 3, hence N = 1 pmod 3 orN = 2 pmod 3.

In particular, her energy may go above 100 if, for instance, she chooses to rest during the first minute.[/list][/hide]","solution":"1. Initial Setup: Applejack starts with 100 energy. She has 60 minutes to either buck trees or rest. Each minute, she can either:   - Buck n trees and lose 1 energy, where n is her current energy.   - Rest and gain 1 energy.2. Resting Strategy: If Applejack rests for the first x minutes, her energy will increase by x units. Therefore, after x minutes of resting, her energy will be 100 + x.3. Bucking Strategy: For the remaining 60 - x minutes, she will buck trees. Each minute, she will buck a number of trees equal to her current energy and then lose 1 energy. 4. Energy Calculation:    - At the start of the (x+1)-th minute, her energy is 100 + x.   - At the start of the (x+2)-th minute, her energy is 100 + x - 1.   - This pattern continues until the 60-th minute.5. Total Trees Calculation: The total number of trees bucked from minute x+1 to minute 60 can be calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series:   [   text{Total trees} = (100 + x) + (99 + x) + (98 + x) + ldots + (100 + x - (60 - x - 1))   ]   Simplifying the last term:   [   100 + x - (60 - x - 1) = 100 + x - 60 + x + 1 = 41 + 2x   ]   Therefore, the series is:   [   (100 + x) + (99 + x) + ldots + (41 + 2x)   ]6. Sum of Arithmetic Series: The sum of the arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series:   [   S = frac{n}{2} left( a + l right)   ]   where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term.   - Here, n = 60 - x   - a = 100 + x   - l = 41 + 2x   Substituting these values:   [   S = frac{60 - x}{2} left( (100 + x) + (41 + 2x) right)   ]   Simplifying inside the parentheses:   [   S = frac{60 - x}{2} left( 141 + 3x right)   ]   Therefore:   [   S = frac{(60 - x)(141 + 3x)}{2}   ]7. Maximizing the Sum: To find the maximum number of trees bucked, we need to maximize the expression:   [   frac{(60 - x)(141 + 3x)}{2}   ]   This is a quadratic expression in x. To find the maximum, we can take the derivative with respect to x and set it to zero:   [   frac{d}{dx} left( frac{(60 - x)(141 + 3x)}{2} right) = 0   ]   Simplifying the derivative:   [   frac{d}{dx} left( (60 - x)(141 + 3x) right) = 0   ]   [   frac{d}{dx} left( 8460 + 180x - 141x - 3x^2 right) = 0   ]   [   180 - 141 - 6x = 0   ]   [   39 - 6x = 0   ]   [   x = frac{39}{6} = 6.5   ]8. Evaluating at Integer Values: Since x must be an integer, we evaluate the expression at x = 6 and x = 7:   - For x = 6:     [     S = frac{(60 - 6)(141 + 3 cdot 6)}{2} = frac{54 cdot 159}{2} = 4293     ]   - For x = 7:     [     S = frac{(60 - 7)(141 + 3 cdot 7)}{2} = frac{53 cdot 162}{2} = 4293     ]   Both values yield the same result.The final answer is boxed{4293}"},{"problem":"1.86 In a convex 1000-gon, 500 points are given.

Between these two roots, only -frac{3}{5} is a possible value for the cosine of an angle within a triangle, as the cosine of an angle cannot be greater than 1.Since we now know that the cosine of the angle between the two sides is -frac{3}{5}, we can find the sine of the angle using the Pythagorean identity for trigonometric functions, which states:sin^2 theta + cos^2 theta = 1.Here, cos theta = -frac{3}{5}, so we have:sin^2 theta + left(-frac{3}{5}right)^2 = 1,sin^2 theta + frac{9}{25} = 1,sin^2 theta = 1 - frac{9}{25},sin^2 theta = frac{16}{25}.Since the sine is a positive value in the first and second quadrants (and our angle is between two sides of a triangle, where it must be less than 180^circ), we have:sin theta = frac{4}{5}.The area A of the triangle can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle with two sides and the included angle:A = frac{1}{2}absin theta,where a and b are the lengths of the sides and theta is the included angle.Using the lengths of the sides given (a = 5, b = 3) and sin theta = frac{4}{5}, we compute the area as follows:A = frac{1}{2} times 5 times 3 times frac{4}{5} = frac{1}{2} times 5 times 3 times frac{4}{5} = 6.Therefore, the area of the triangle is boxed{6}."},{"problem":"Problem 2.1.

Although the problem provides the definition of a magic number, it is not convenient to directly use this definition to determine whether a number is a magic number.

How can this number be expressed in terms of P and Q? This clearly depends on how many digits P has. If P is an m-digit number, then the number obtained by appending P to the right of Q is Q cdot 10^{m} + P. Using this, we can derive a simplified and equivalent condition based on the definition of a magic number.Solution: Let P be a magic number, and assume it is an m-digit number.According to the condition, for any natural number Q, we haveP midleft(Q cdot 10^{m} + Pright),which implies P mid Q cdot 10^{m} (for any Q in mathbf{N}).Taking Q=1, we get P mid 10^{m}.Conversely, if P mid 10^{m}, then for any Q in mathbf{N}, we have P mid Q cdot 10^{m}.Thus, P midleft(Q cdot 10^{m} + Pright).Therefore, P is an m-digit magic number if and only if P mid 10^{m}.(1) When m=1, P mid 10, and P is a one-digit number, so P=1,2,5.(2) When m=2, P mid 10^{2}, i.e., P midleft(2^{2} times 5^{2}right), and P is a two-digit number, so,P=2^{0} times 5^{2}, 2^{1} times 5^{1}, 2^{1} times 5^{2}, 2^{2} times 5^{1}.(3) When m=3, P mid 10^{3}, i.e., P midleft(2^{3} times 5^{3}right), and P is a three-digit number, P<130, so,P=2^{0} times 5^{3}, 2^{2} times 5^{2}.In summary, there are 3+4+2=9 magic numbers that meet the conditions."},{"problem":"## Task A-2.3.Determine all triples (x, y, z) of positive real numbers that satisfy the system of equations[begin{aligned}3lfloor xrfloor - {y} + {z} & = 20.3 3lfloor yrfloor + 5lfloor zrfloor - {x} & = 15.1 {y} + {z} & = 0.9end{aligned}]For a real number t, lfloor trfloor denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to t, and {t} denotes its fractional part, {t} = t - lfloor trfloor.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the smallest amusing odd integer greater than 1.

Analyzing ( d(k) ):   Since ( d(k) ) is odd, ( k ) must be a perfect square. This is because the number of divisors of a number is odd if and only if the number is a perfect square. 3. Analyzing ( s(k) ):   We also need ( s(k) ) to be equal to ( n ). Since ( s(k) equiv k pmod{9} ) (a property of digit sums), we have ( n equiv k pmod{9} ).4. Possible Values of ( k ):   Since ( k ) is a perfect square, ( k equiv 0, 1, 4, 7 pmod{9} ). We need to find the smallest odd ( n > 1 ) such that ( n equiv k pmod{9} ) and ( d(k) = s(k) = n ).5. Checking Small Values of ( n ):   - For ( n = 3 ): ( k equiv 3 pmod{9} ) is not possible since ( k ) must be a perfect square.   - For ( n = 5 ): ( k equiv 5 pmod{9} ) is not possible since ( k ) must be a perfect square.   - For ( n = 7 ): ( k equiv 7 pmod{9} ) is possible. We need ( k ) such that ( d(k) = 7 ) and ( s(k) = 7 ). The form of ( k ) would be ( p^6 ) where ( p ) is a prime. However, checking small primes, ( p^6 notequiv 7 pmod{9} ) for any ( p ).6.

We proceed by induction on ( n ).   - Base Case: For ( n = 0 ), we have:     [     f((0.r)*s) = f(s) = frac{1}{2^0} left( (2^0 - 1) f(r) + f(s) right) = f(s)     ]     which is trivially true.   - Inductive Step: Assume the statement is true for some ( n ). We need to show it holds for ( n + 1 ). Observe that ( (n.r)*s ) and ( r ) are adjacent because:     [     |(na + c)b - (nb + d)a| = |bc - ad| = 1     ]     So we can apply the second condition to get:     [     f(((n+1).r)*s) = frac{1}{2} left( f((n.r)*s) + f(r) right)     ]     By the inductive hypothesis:     [     f((n.r)*s) = frac{1}{2^n} left( (2^n - 1) f(r) + f(s) right)     ]     Therefore:     [     f(((n+1).r)*s) = frac{1}{2} left( frac{1}{2^n} left( (2^n - 1) f(r) + f(s) right) + f(r) right)     ]     Simplifying:     [     f(((n+1).r)*s) = frac{1}{2^{n+1}} left( (2^n - 1) f(r) + f(s) + 2^n f(r) right) = frac{1}{2^{n+1}} left( (2^{n+1} - 1) f(r) + f(s) right)     ]     This completes the induction.2. Given a real number ( x ), consider its continued fraction ( x = [a_0, a_1, a_2, ldots] ) (where ( a_0 = lfloor x rfloor ) and ( a_k in mathbb{N} ) for all ( k > 0 )). Define the convergents ( c_n = [a_0, ldots, a_n] ) for all ( n geq 0 ).3. Define ( A_k = sum_{i=1}^{k} a_i ) for all ( k geq 1 ). If we set ( (p_0, q_0) = (a_0, 1) ), ( (p_1, q_1) = (a_0 a_1 + 1, a_1) ), and ( (p_n, q_n) = (a_n p_{n-1} + p_{n-2}, a_n q_{n-1} + q_{n-2}) ) for all ( n geq 2 ), then:   - ( c_n = frac{p_n}{q_n} ) for all ( n geq 0 ).   - ( p_n q_{n-1} - q_n p_{n-1} = (-1)^{n-1} ) (so ( c_n ) and ( c_{n-1} ) are adjacent) for all ( n > 0 ).   - ( p_n q_{n-2} - p_{n-2} q_n = (-1)^n a_n ) for all ( n > 1 ).4. We have ( f(c_0) = a_0 ), ( f(c_1) = fleft( ((a_1-1).c_0) * (a_0+1) right) = a_0 + frac{1}{2^{a_1-1}} ). Using ( c_n = (a_n.c_{n-1})*c_{n-2} ), we can prove by induction:   [   f(c_n) = a_0 - 2 sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{(-1)^k}{2^{A_k}}   ]   for all ( n > 0 ).5. Case 1: ( x ) is rational. Then ( x = [a_0, ldots, a_m] ) for some ( m geq 0 ). If ( m = 0 ), then ( x ) is an integer and ( f(x) = x ). Otherwise:   [   f(x) = f(c_m) = a_0 - 2 sum_{k=1}^{m} frac{(-1)^k}{2^{A_k}}   ]   which is uniquely determined.6. Case 2: ( x ) is irrational. Then the continued fraction is infinite. We have ( x = lim_{n to infty} c_n ). From the properties of continued fractions, we get ( (c_{2n}) ) (resp. ( (c_{2n+1}) )) is increasing (resp. decreasing), so ( c_{2n} leq x leq c_{2n+1} ) for all ( n geq 0 ). Since ( f ) is increasing, it follows that:   [   f(c_{2n}) leq f(x) leq f(c_{2n+1})   ]   for all ( n geq 0 ).7. But ( f(c_n) = a_0 - 2 sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{(-1)^k}{2^{A_k}} ) for all ( n geq 1 ), and ( A_k geq k ), so ( sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{(-1)^k}{2^{A_k}} ) is convergent. Therefore, ( (f(c_n)) ) converges to:   [   a_0 - 2 sum_{n geq 1} frac{(-1)^n}{2^{A_n}}   ]   We conclude that:   [   f(x) = a_0 - 2 sum_{n geq 1} frac{(-1)^n}{2^{A_n}}   ]   which is uniquely determined.The final answer is ( boxed{ f(x) = a_0 - 2 sum_{n geq 1} frac{(-1)^n}{2^{A_n}} } )"},{"problem":"Given that the sequence {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence, a_1=tan225°, a_5=13a_1, let S_n be the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {(-1)^na_n}, then S_{2016}= （ ）A: 2016B: -2016C: 3024D: -3024","solution":"Let the common difference of the arithmetic sequence {a_n} be d,Since a_1=tan225°=1, a_5=13a_1=13,Therefore, 13=1+4d, solving this gives d=3.Thus, a_n=1+3(n-1)=3n-2.Therefore, -a_{2n-1}+a_{2n}=-[3(2n-1)-2]+(3times2n-2)=3.Therefore, the sum of the first 2016 terms of the sequence {(-1)^na_n}, S_{2016}=3times1008=3024.Hence, the correct answer is: boxed{C}.Analysis: By using the general formula of an arithmetic sequence, we can find the common difference d, and it can be derived that -a_{2n-1}+a_{2n}=3.

In particular, a side of P is also considered good.Suppose P is triangulated by 2003 diagonals that do not intersect in the interior of P. Find the maximum number of isosceles triangles in this triangulation that have two good sides. (47th IMO Problem)","solution":"Define an isosceles triangle with two good sides as a good triangle. First, consider special cases.For a square, there is essentially only one type of division, and the number of good triangles is 2;For a regular hexagon, there are essentially only 3 types of divisions, and the maximum number of good triangles is 3. We also notice that when the maximum value is reached, the legs of the good triangles are all sides of P.For the general case, it is not difficult to find that the maximum number of good triangles in the division of a regular 2n-sided polygon is n.In fact, for any triangle ABC in the division graph, the boundary of P is divided into 3 segments by A, B, and C. The number of sides of P contained in the A-B segment (counting counterclockwise from A to B) is denoted as m(AB), and so on.Since m(AB) + m(BC) + m(CA) = 2006, if an isosceles triangle has two good sides, then it has exactly two good sides, and these two good sides are the two legs (otherwise, all three sides would be good, which is a contradiction).Consider any good triangle ABC, where AB = AC. If there are other good triangles on the A-B segment, remove all the sides of P cut by the two legs of these good triangles, and the number of sides of P removed is even. Continue this process until there are no good triangles on the A-B segment. Since the A-B segment has an odd number of sides, at least one side alpha is not removed (if AB itself is a side of P, then alpha = AB), and alpha does not belong to a smaller leg segment than AB. Similarly, after removing several good triangles from the A-C segment, there is a side beta of P that does not belong to a smaller leg segment than AC. Let the triangle triangle ABC correspond to the 2-element set {alpha, beta}.For two different good triangles triangle ABC and triangle A_1B_1C_1 in the same division, their corresponding 2-element sets are {alpha, beta} and {alpha_1, beta_1}. If triangle A_1B_1C_1 is not on the leg segment of triangle ABC, then triangle A_1B_1C_1 is on the B-C segment of triangle ABC. In this case, the sides in {alpha, beta} are on the leg segments of triangle ABC, and the sides in {alpha_1, beta_1} are on the B-C segment of triangle ABC, so {alpha, beta} and {alpha_1, beta_1} have no common sides; if triangle A_1B_1C_1 is on the leg segment of triangle ABC, say on the A-B segment, then the sides in the 2-element set {alpha, beta} belong to the sides removed from the leg segment of triangle A_1B_1C_1, and the sides in the 2-element set {alpha_1, beta_1} are the sides of the leg segment of triangle A_1B_1C_1, thus the two 2-element sets have no common sides.Note that 2006 sides can have at most frac{2006}{2} = 1003 2-element subsets with no common elements, so the number of good triangles is no more than 1003.Finally, let P = A_1A_2 cdots A_{2006}, and the division graph formed by the diagonals A_1A_{2k+1} (1 leq k leq 1002) and A_{2k+1}A_{2k+3} (1 leq k leq 1001) has exactly 1003 good triangles.Therefore, the maximum number of good triangles is 1003."},{"problem":"If the graph of the linear function y=-2x+1 passes through Aleft(m,nright), then the value of 4m+2n+2022 is ______.","solution":"Given that the graph of the linear function y=-2x+1 passes through the point A(m,n), we can substitute m for x and n for y in the equation to find the relationship between m and n.

Generally, for a p times q chessboard (where m < p, n < q), the number of bad cells is no less than (p - m)(q - n).We prove this by induction on p + q. When p + q = m + n + 2, since p geq m + 1 and q geq n + 1, we have p = m + 1 and q = n + 1. Because the cell containing the smallest number must be a bad cell, the number of bad cells is no less than 1 = (p - m)(q - n), so the conclusion holds. Assume that the conclusion holds for p + q = t. Consider the case when p + q = t + 1. By the lemma, assume there exists a row that does not contain any good cells in bad columns. Remove this row, and we get a (p-1) times q chessboard. Since p + q - 1 = t, by the induction hypothesis, this chessboard has no less than (p-1 - m)(q - n) bad cells. Adding back the removed row, the original bad cells remain bad, and the bad cells in this row must also be bad (since this row does not contain any good cells in bad columns). There are (q - n) bad cells in this row, so the total number of bad cells is no less than (p-1 - m)(q - n) + (q - n) = (p - m)(q - n). By the principle of induction, the proposition is proved.For the original problem, the number of bad cells is no less than (2001 - m)(2002 - n).

Solution. The first toss can be heads or tails (henceforth f and i). Let's look at the valid toss sequences.

Simplify the problem:   Write ( p = 2k + 1 ). If ( k = 1 ), then ( p = 3 ), and any singleton will satisfy the condition. Suppose ( p > 3 ), i.e., ( k > 1 ).3. Identify potential solutions:   Consider tuples ((x_1, x_2, cdots, x_k) in {0, 1}^k). These tuples satisfy the given conditions. We need to show that these are the only solutions.4. Polynomial approach:   For any polynomial ( P ) of degree (leq frac{p-1}{2}) with the sum of coefficients congruent to 0 modulo ( p ), we have:   [   sum P(x_i) equiv P(0) cdot (k - t) pmod{p},   ]   where ( t = sum x_i ).5. Construct a specific polynomial:   Consider the polynomial ( P(x) = (b - x)^k - (b-1)^k ). This polynomial is divisible by ( x-1 ), so the sum of its coefficients is 0. Therefore:   [   left(sum (b - x_i)^k right) - k (b-1)^k equiv left(b^k - (b-1)^k right) cdot (k - t) pmod{p},   ]   for all integers ( b ).6. Use properties of Legendre symbols:   Notice that ( a^k equiv left( frac{a}{p} right) ) for all integers ( a ). Thus, whenever ( left( frac{b}{p} right) = left( frac{b-1}{p} right) ), we have:   [   left(sum left(frac{b-x_i}{p} right) right) equiv k cdot left( frac{b-1}{p} right) pmod{p}.   ]7. Bounding and implications:   Since ( left( frac{b-x_i}{p} right) in {-1, 0, 1} ), simple bounding yields:   [   left( frac{b - x_i}{p} right) = left( frac{b-1}{p} right),   ]   for all ( 1 le i le k ).8. Analyze quadratic residues:   For every ( 1 le i le k ) and integer ( a ), if ( left( frac{a(a-1)}{p} right) = 1 ), then:   [   left( frac{a(a-x_i)}{p} right) = 1.   ]   We claim that this implies ( x_i in {0, 1} ).9. Contradiction argument:   Suppose ( x_i notin {0, 1} ). It is known that for a quadratic ( f(x) = alpha x^2 + beta x + gamma ) not a perfect square in ( mathbb{Z}_p[x] ):   [   sum_{i=0}^{p-1} left( frac{f(i)}{p} right) = -1.   ]   For ( f_1(x) = x^2 - x ) and ( f_2(x) = x^2 - kx ), there are precisely two roots for each, (frac{p-3}{2}) residues for which they evaluate to a nonzero square modulo ( p ), and (frac{p-1}{2}) for which they evaluate to a non-quadratic residue.10. Summing over residue classes:    From the above, for all ( a notin {0, 1, k} ):    [    left( frac{a(a-1)}{p} right) = left( frac{a(a-k)}{p} right) Rightarrow left( frac{(a-1)(a-k)}{p} right) = 1.    ]    Summing over all residue classes and applying the result gives a contradiction.11.

The solution is based on two simple observations. First, angle X W Z=90^{circ}, since it subtends the diameter. Second, V W and V Z are tangents to the circle from the condition, so V W=V Z.

Let D be the foot of the altitude from point A, and point E be the intersection of this altitude with the circumcircle of triangle ABC, point A' be diametrically opposite to point A on this circle, and point N be the second intersection of line AK with this circle. From the parallelism of lines OH and BC, it follows that line OH is perpendicular to the altitude AD. Since AA' is the diameter of the circle, angle AEA' = 90^circ and, therefore, lines A'E and OH are parallel. Thus, OH is the midline of triangle AA'E, so AH = HE. Further,angle CBE = angle CAE = 90^circ - angle ACB = angle CBH,so in triangle BEH, segment BD is both a bisector and an altitude, and therefore also a median. Thus, HD = DE. From the equalities AH = HE and HD = DE, we get that AH: AD = 2: 3.By the condition, lines AK and BH are parallel, and line BH is perpendicular to line AC, so angle NAC = 90^circ and points C and N are diametrically opposite. Therefore, angle NBC = 90^circ and lines NB and AH are parallel. Thus, quadrilateral AHBN is a parallelogram. Therefore, AN = BH = AK and segment CA is a median in triangle KCN. But segment KO is also a median in this triangle. Therefore, L is the intersection of the medians of this triangle and AL: AC = 1: 3. Then, by Thales' theorem, AM: AD = 1: 3. But we already know that AH: AD = 2: 3, so AM = MH.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_e0197926f6acc0f95da5g-04.jpg?height=853&width=903&top_left_y=156&top_left_x=588)Second solution. Note that if points A', B', and C' are the midpoints of sides BC, CA, and AB of triangle ABC, then triangle A'B'C' is similar to triangle ABC with a similarity coefficient of frac{1}{2}. On the other hand, the center of the circumcircle of triangle ABC is the orthocenter of triangle A'B'C'. Therefore, AH = 2OA' and BH = 2OB'.Let D be the foot of the altitude from point A, and M be the foot of the perpendicular dropped from point L to AH. Line OA' is the perpendicular bisector of segment BC, so it is parallel to the altitude AD. By the condition, lines OH and BC are parallel, so OHDA' is a rectangle and HD = OA' = frac{1}{2}AH.In parallelogram ABHK, opposite sides are equal, so AK = BH = 2OB'. Triangles ALK and B'LO are similar by two angles (angle ALK = angle B'LO as vertical angles, angle OB'L = 90^circ = angle KAL) and their similarity coefficient is 2.

Therefore, AH = 2OA' and BH = 2OB'.Let D be the foot of the altitude from point A, M be the foot of the perpendicular dropped from point L to AH, and P be the midpoint of segment AK. Line OA' is the perpendicular bisector of segment BC, so it is parallel to the altitude AD. By the condition, lines OH and BC are parallel, so OHDA' is a rectangle and HD = OA' = frac{1}{2}AH. Thus, frac{AH}{AD} = frac{2}{3}. By the condition, lines AK and BH are parallel, and line BH is perpendicular to line AC, so angle KAC = 90^circ. By the condition, ABHK is a parallelogram, so AK = BH. Segment B'P is the midline of triangle CAK, so B'P = frac{1}{2}AK = frac{1}{2}BH = OB'. Moreover, OB' and PB' are perpendicular to AC, so points O, B', and P lie on the same line. Thus, OP = 2OB' = AK and OP is parallel to AK. Therefore, AOPK is a parallelogram. Let Q be the intersection of its diagonals, then AQ = QP. Therefore, AB' and OQ are medians of triangle AOP, and L is their intersection, so AL: AB' = 2: 3 and, therefore, AL: AC = 1: 3.

The number of different sums is C_{2020}^{1010} (the number of ways to choose 1010 terms in odd positions).Method 2. Notice that if a grasshopper jumps over some point A and then over some point B, it will ultimately move by the vector 2 A B=2(O B-O A).Each finish point can be associated with a sequence in which Kolya jumped over his friends to end up in this point after 2020 jumps - that is, a permutation of the numbers from 1 to 2020 (consider all grasshoppers except Kolya to be numbered). Suppose Kolya at some point is at point O and is about to jump over grasshoppers located at points A, B, C (considering only three consecutive jumps). If Kolya makes these jumps in the order A B C, he will first move by the vector2OA, and then over two jumps will move by the vector 2 B C=2(O C-O B), so in the end, after three jumps, he will move by the vector 2(overrightarrow{O A}+overrightarrow{O C}-overrightarrow{O B}). If Kolya makes these jumps in the order C B A, then, similarly, he will move by the vector 2(O C+O A-O B), that is, he will end up in the same point as in the previous case. Thus, in the sequence of Kolya's jumps, any two grasshoppers standing one apart can be swapped, and this will not change the finish point. Therefore, the finish point is characterized not by the permutation of the numbers from 1 to 2020 (of which there are 2020!), but only by which numbers in such a permutation stand in odd positions. Accordingly, there cannot be more than C_{2020}^{1010} different finish points.Example. Place the grasshoppers at points on the number line with coordinates 0 (at Kolya), 1, 3, 3², ..., 3^{2019}. Prove that all sums of powers of three with coefficients pm 1 are different. By adding a constant sum 1+3+3^{2}+ldots+3^{2019} to such a sum, we get a sum with coefficients 0 and 2. It corresponds to a 2020-digit ternary number consisting of zeros and twos, and all such numbers are different.## AnswerFor N=C_{2020}^{1010}"},{"problem":"In the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, _x_, 34, 55, ... the value of _x_ is __________.","solution":"Analysis of the Problem:According to the problem, since 2 = 1 + 1, 3 = 1 + 2, 5 = 3 + 2, and so on, we can deduce that 55 = 34 + x.

This x-intercept corresponds to one of the vertices of the ellipse's major axis, so we have a = sqrt{3}. The eccentricity e is given as frac{sqrt{6}}{3}, and we know that e = frac{c}{a}, where c is the distance from the center to a focus. Solving for c gives us c = e cdot a = frac{sqrt{6}}{3} cdot sqrt{3} = sqrt{2}. The relationship between a, b, and c in an ellipse is c^2 = a^2 - b^2. Substituting the known values, we get b^2 = a^2 - c^2 = (sqrt{3})^2 - (sqrt{2})^2 = 3 - 2 = 1. Therefore, the equation of the ellipse E is frac{x^2}{3} + y^2 = 1.Part (2): Area of triangle ABCGiven that overrightarrow{OA} + overrightarrow{OB} + overrightarrow{OC} = 0, we can deduce that p + x_1 + x_2 = 0 and q + y_1 + y_2 = 0. This implies p = -(x_1 + x_2) and q = -(y_1 + y_2). For the intersection points B(x_1, y_1) and C(x_2, y_2) with the line l, we solve the system of equations consisting of the ellipse equation frac{x^2}{3} + y^2 = 1 and the line equation y = kx + m. Substituting y from the line equation into the ellipse equation gives us a quadratic equation in x. The discriminant Delta of this quadratic equation must be greater than 0 for the line to intersect the ellipse, which leads to Delta = 12(3k^2 + 1 - m^2) > 0.Using Vieta's formulas, we find the sums and products of the roots: x_1 + x_2 = frac{-6km}{1 + 3k^2} and x_1x_2 = frac{3(m^2 - 1)}{1 + 3k^2}. This allows us to express y_1 + y_2 in terms of k and m, and subsequently, we find q = -(y_1 + y_2).Substituting p and q into the ellipse equation gives us a condition that simplifies to 4m^2 = 1 + 3k^2.

Understanding the Pattern: For any positive integer m greater than 1, the cube of m, denoted as m^3, can be expressed as the sum of m consecutive odd numbers. This pattern is observed as follows:   - For m=2, 2^3 = 3 + 5.   - For m=3, 3^3 = 7 + 9 + 11.   - For m=4, 4^3 = 13 + 15 + 17 + 19, and so on.2. Finding the Total Number of Odd Numbers: Given that the sequence of odd numbers starts from 1, and each m^3 is split into m consecutive odd numbers, we can find the total number of odd numbers up to m^3 by summing the series 2 + 3 + 4 + ldots + m. This sum can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:   [   text{Total number of odd numbers} = frac{(m+2)(m-1)}{2}.   ]3. Identifying the Position of 2015: Since 2015 is an odd number, it can be expressed as 2n + 1 = 2015, where n is the position of the odd number in the sequence starting from 1. Solving for n gives us:   [   n = frac{2015 - 1}{2} = 1007.   ]   Therefore, 2015 is the 1007th odd number in the sequence starting from 1.4. Determining the Value of m: To find the value of m for which 2015 is one of the odd numbers in the split of m^3, we need to find the range in which the 1007th odd number falls. We calculate the total number of odd numbers for consecutive values of m until we find the range that includes 1007:   - For m=44, the total number of odd numbers up to m^3 is frac{(44+2)(44-1)}{2} = 989.   - For m=45, the total number of odd numbers up to m^3 is frac{(45+2)(45-1)}{2} = 1034.   Since 1007 falls between 989 and 1034, it indicates that 2015, the 1007th odd number, is one of the odd numbers split from the cube of the base 45.Therefore, the value of m for which one of the odd numbers in the split of m^3 is 2015 is boxed{45}."},{"problem":"Example 5 Express frac{107}{95} as a continued fraction.","solution":"begin{aligned}frac{107}{95} & =1+frac{12}{95}=1+frac{1}{frac{95}{12}}=1+frac{1}{7+frac{11}{12}} & =1+frac{1}{7+frac{1}{1+frac{1}{11}}}=[1,7,1,11]end{aligned}We havebegin{aligned}frac{107}{95} & =1+frac{12}{95}=1+frac{1}{frac{95}{12}}=1+frac{1}{7+frac{11}{12}} & =1+frac{1}{7+frac{1}{1+frac{1}{11}}}=[1,7,1,11]end{aligned}"},{"problem":"## Task 3/70It is x^{0}=1 and 0^{x}=0 for x neq 0.

If x geqslant 2, then 2^{y} equiv 2 pmod{4} but 2^{y} geqslant 4, which is absurd. Hence x in{0,1}. A quick calculation leads to x=1 and y=2, it follows b=1 and d=1 so: (a, b)=(2,3).

Let y be the maximum number written on the children of X. Let z be the maximum of the positive integers less than y that do not appear on the children of X. The number z must exist because 1 cannot appear on any branch. Then z+1 appears on one of the children of X. If z>1, then z+1>2, so z appears on one of the children of X. This is a contradiction, so z=1. Therefore, the numbers 2,3, ldots, y all appear on the children of X. The siblings have different numbers of children, so there is exactly one of each. Thus, the number of children of X is y-1, so y=x+1. Therefore, the numbers written on the children of X are 2,3, ldots, x+1.Let's introduce a directed graph among the branches, where there are two types of edges: one type is a \\"vertical\\" edge, which leads from a branch labeled x to its child labeled x+1, and the other type is a \\"horizontal\\" edge, which leads from a branch labeled x to its sibling labeled x-1, if x>2. It can be seen that in the graph, there is exactly one way to reach the trunk of the tree from each branch, because from each branch, there is exactly one way to reach each of its children. From each branch, exactly one vertical and exactly one horizontal edge starts, except for the 2-labeled branches, from which only a vertical edge starts.The number of branches starting at height n is equal to the number of 2-labeled branches starting at height n+1, because every branch has exactly one 2-labeled child. Let's select a 2-labeled branch X starting at height n+1. There is exactly one path in the graph from the trunk of the tree to X. Let's call finite sequences consisting of + and - signs (+/-) sequences. The path can be described by a (+/-) sequence, where + represents a vertical edge and - represents a horizontal edge. The (+/-) sequence uniquely determines X. It can be seen that with each +, the number on the current branch increases by one, and with each -, it decreases by one, as we move along the path according to the sequence. The number 2 appears on both the first and the last branch of the path, so the number of + and - signs is the same. The path from the trunk to X contains n+1 vertical edges, because the height increases by one with each vertical edge, and does not change with horizontal edges. Thus, the number of - signs is also n+1. Let's call a (+/-) sequence with n+1 + signs and n+1 - signs good if for each i, the number of + signs among the first i terms is at least as many as the number of - signs. The number on each branch of the path is at least 2, and the number on the first branch is 2, from which it is easy to see that the (+/-) sequence corresponding to X is good. It can also be seen that if the (+/-) sequence is good, then it is not possible to try to move along a horizontal edge from a 2-labeled branch. Thus, the number of good (+/-) sequences is equal to the number of branches starting at height n.The number of good sequences can be calculated by subtracting the number of non-good sequences from the number of all (+/-) sequences with n+1 + signs and n+1 - signs. The number of all such sequences is binom{2 n+2}{n+1}. Let's take a sequence that is not good. There is a minimal i for which the number of - signs among the first i terms is more than the number of + signs. By minimality, among the first i-1 terms, there are at most as many - signs as + signs. This can only happen if among the first i-1 terms, there are as many + signs as - signs, and the i-th term is -. Let's change all the terms after the i-th term, and call this the modified sequence. If we also changed the i-th term, the number of + and - signs would not change (because they are equal). Thus, in the modified sequence, there are n + signs and n+2 - signs. It can be seen that for a sequence with n + signs and n+2 - signs, there is an i for which the number of - signs among the first i terms is more than the number of + signs (because it is more in the entire sequence). Notice that if we change all the terms after the minimal i-th term, we get back the original sequence. Thus, the number of non-good sequences is equal to the number of sequences with n + signs and n+2 - signs, which is binom{2 n+2}{n}.Therefore, the number of branches is: binom{2 n+2}{n+1}-binom{2 n+2}{n}, which is the (n+1)-th Catalan number.Based on the work of Gáspár Attila (Miskolc, Földes Ferenc Gimn., 12th grade)Note. The majority of the contestants who provided the correct solution arrived at the conclusion that the number of branches starting at height n is the (n+1)-th Catalan number by reducing the problem to some known problem.

Therefore, the inverse statement does not hold in all cases, making option A a valid choice.- Statement B: The original statement is \\"If |a|=|b|, then a=b.\\" The inverse statement would be \\"If a=b, then |a|=|b|.\\" This inverse statement is true because if two numbers are equal, their absolute values are also equal. This makes option B incorrect because its inverse statement is valid.- Statement C: The original statement is \\"If two lines are parallel, then the alternate interior angles are equal.\\" The inverse statement would be \\"If the alternate interior angles are equal, then the two lines are parallel.\\" This inverse statement is true due to the converse of the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem in geometry, which states that if alternate interior angles are equal, the lines are parallel.

To find the equation of the trajectory of P, we proceed as follows:1. Distance between M and N: The distance between points M and N can be calculated using the distance formula, which gives us |MN| = 2sqrt{5}.2. Condition |PM|-|PN|=4: Given the condition |PM|-|PN|=4, we note that this is less than |MN|, which is 2sqrt{5}. This implies that the trajectory of P is related to a hyperbola, as it involves the difference in distances to two fixed points (the foci).3. Parameters of the hyperbola: For a hyperbola, the relationship between its semi-major axis a, semi-minor axis b, and the distance between the foci 2c is given by c^2 = a^2 + b^2. Given that 2a=4 (from the condition |PM|-|PN|=4), we find a=2. Also, since the distance between the foci 2c=2sqrt{5}, we have c=sqrt{5}.4. Finding b^2: Using the relationship c^2 = a^2 + b^2, and substituting a=2 and c=sqrt{5}, we solve for b^2:   [   b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = (sqrt{5})^2 - 2^2 = 5 - 4 = 1.   ]5.

Therefore, we will look for the natural exponent of 2 where the sum of the digits is 5.By examining the cases n=0,1,2,3,4,5, we can see that for 2^{5}=32, the sum of the digits is exactly 5. We claim that if n>5, then the sum of the digits of 2^{n} cannot be 5, meaning the only solution is n=5.Suppose this is not true, and there is a natural number n>5 for which the sum of the digits of 2^{n} is 5. In this case, each digit is at most 4 (since 2^{n} has at least two digits), the number itself is even, and not divisible by 10, so the last digit is either 2 or 4.If the last digit were 4, then the first digit would be 1, and all intermediate digits would be 0. Since n>5, 2^{n} is divisible by 8 - and even by 64 - so the number formed by the last three digits is also a multiple of 8. According to the above, this number could be 4, 14, or 104, of which only 104 is divisible by 8. Thus, 104 could be the 2-power in question, but 104 is not a power of 2.If the last digit is 2, then - since 2^{n} is divisible by 4 - the number formed by the last two digits is also divisible by 4. Therefore, the second-to-last digit is 3 or 1. In the former case, the already known 32 results. If the second-to-last digit is 1, then it is preceded by an odd digit, because the number formed by the last three digits can only be divisible by 8 in this way. The sum of the digits is 5, so the last three digits are 112.Proceeding similarly, from the fact that the number formed by the last four digits is divisible by 16, and the number formed by the last five digits is divisible by 32, we get that the fourth and fifth digits from the end must necessarily be 0 and 1, respectively.

How many times is it possible to dine if everyone wants to have two new neighbors each time? What is the result for eighteen people?","solution":"Note: This exercise is the same as Exercise 1 (middle school students were to solve 1, high school students 5), but in a less particular case. The proposed solution below is very general, but difficult for an average high school student to access. This exercise was therefore intended to identify the students best equipped to tackle formidable Olympic problems.Solution: The first thing to notice is the following. We call n the number of guests (17 or 18), and k the number of dinners; we are interested in a particular guest among the n. Knowing that he has two neighbors at each dinner, and that he must never meet the same person more than once, he will therefore meet 2 k different people in total. But there are only n-1 people he can meet; we therefore have 2 k leq n-1, which means - in both cases - that there are at most 8 possible dinners. Let's now show that there indeed exist 8 arrangements such that two people are never neighbors more than once. We number the guests and the seats from 0 to n-1 (since the table is round, the (n-1)-th seat is therefore next to the 0-th), and the arrangements from 1 to 8. For n=17, we can proceed as follows: at the i-th dinner, we place the j-th person at the i j-th seat modulo 17. (The complete scheme of arrangements is presented a little further down. In a less abstract, but longer and vaguer way, we can say that the first Saturday, we place all the guests in order; the second Saturday, we place one out of two; the third, one out of three; and so on; knowing that when the numbers exceed 17, we \\"return to 0\\".) We must verify two things. First, let's verify that it is a valid arrangement. Each guest receives one and only one seat, because between 0 and 16, there is one and only one number congruent to a given residue modulo 17. No seat is occupied by two guests: indeed, let j and j^{prime} be two guests who occupy the same seat at the i-th dinner. Then we have i j equiv i j^{prime}(bmod 17), or 17 mid i j-i j^{prime}, or again 17 mid ileft(j-j^{prime}right). Since 17 is prime and 0<i<17, i is coprime with 17, so 17 mid j-j^{prime}. We therefore have j equiv j^{prime}(bmod 17), which means j=j^{prime}. And since there are as many seats as guests, all seats are necessarily occupied. Now let's verify that it is indeed a solution to the problem. Since the difference between the numbers of two adjacent seats is congruent to pm 1 modulo 17, this means that at the i-th dinner, the difference between the numbers of two adjacent people is congruent to pm i modulo 17. But the numbers pm 1, pm 2, ldots, pm 8 are all different modulo 17: two given people can therefore be neighbors only once. We could also have explicitly presented the scheme of arrangements:Place quad 0123456789101112131415161st dinner 0123456789101112131415162nd dinner 0246810121416135791113153rd dinner 0369121514710131625811144th dinner 0481216371115261014159135th dinner 0510153813161116491427126th dinner 0612171328143915410165117th dinner 0714411181551229166133108th dinner 081671561451341231121019and verify that each guest appears once and only once in each row and has different neighbors in each row. But such a solution, although less abstract, would be much more laborious (366 checks to be made in total!), and has the drawback of being \\"parachuted\\": one can see that it works, but one does not understand very well why it works. For n=18, a possible solution is to start from the previous arrangement and to intercalate the new person somewhere each time. Since we already know that the first 17 people are well placed as required, it is enough to make sure that the last person (who, however, bears the number 17: this is not an error, as we numbered from 0) has different neighbors each time. We can, for example, place him between 3 and 4 at the first dinner, between 11 and 13 at the second, then between 2 and 5, between 10 and 14, between 1 and 6, between 9 and 15, between 0 and 7, and finally between 8 and 16 at the eighth dinner: each number between 0 and 16 appears well at most once in this list. The complete arrangement is therefore as follows:| Place 01234567891011121314151617 || :--- || 1st dinner 01231745678910111213141516 || 2nd dinner 02468101214161357911171315 || 3rd dinner 03691215147101316217581114 || 4th dinner 04812163711152610171415913 || 5th dinner 05101538131176111649142712 || 6th dinner 06121713281439171541016511 || 7th dinner 01771441118155122916613310 || 8th dinner 08171671561451341231121019. |"},{"problem":"Determine the nature of the statement \\"a=2\\" for the equation x^2 - 3x + a = 0 having real roots.A: Sufficient but not necessary conditionB: Necessary but not sufficient conditionC: Necessary and sufficient conditionD: Neither sufficient nor necessary condition","solution":"To determine if the quadratic equation x^2 - 3x + a = 0 has real roots, we need to look at its discriminant, Delta = b^2 - 4ac.

Consider each person as a point. Without loss of generality, let the point where Arthur is located be denoted as A. Since handshakes occur in pairs, the number of people on either side of Arthur and the person he shakes hands with must be 0 or even.If there are 2 people, there is only one way to shake hands, so N_{1}=1.If there are 4 people, Arthur can shake hands with his adjacent person (such as B or D in Figure 4), but not with the opposite person C, otherwise, it would cause a crossing. Therefore, N_{2}=2.If there are 6 people, Arthur can shake hands with his adjacent person (such as B or F in Figure 5), and the remaining 4 people have N_{2} ways to shake hands. Arthur can also shake hands with the opposite person D, and on both sides of AD, there are 2 people, BC and FE each have N_{1} ways to shake hands. Therefore, N_{3}=2 N_{2}+N_{1}^{2}=5.Using this method, we can gradually find N_{6}.When there are 8 people, Arthur can shake hands with his adjacent person (such as B or H in Figure 6). The remaining 6 people on one side have N_{3} ways to shake hands. Arthur can also shake hands with D or F, then the 2 people on one side have N_{1} ways to shake hands, and the 4 people on the other side have N_{2} ways to shake hands.

One set of alternate vertices forms a square area 5. The other set forms a rectangle area 4. What is the maximum possible area for the octagon? Solution","solution":": 3√5. Evidently the circle has radius √5/√2, and the rectangle has sides √2 and 2√2. The trick is to focus on the rectangle. The area of the octagon is the area of the rectangle plus the area of the four triangles on its sides. The area of each of these triangles is maximised by taking the vertex midway between the two vertices of the rectangle. But these four midpoints happen to form a square. The area of the two triangles with common base on a side of the rectangle, one with third vertex at the centre of the circle and the other at the midpoint of the arc is (radius x side)/2.

The relationship between the total cost P (text{in 10,000 yuan}) of building the dormitory and the distance x (text{in km}) between the dormitory and the factory is given by P=frac{k}{{3x+2}} for 0≤x≤5.

Find the largest possible value of the expression  frac {S(n)}{S(16n)}.","solution":"1. We start by noting that ( S(n) ) denotes the sum of the digits of ( n ). We need to find the largest possible value of the expression ( frac{S(n)}{S(16n)} ).2. Observe that ( S(10^k n) = S(n) ) for any integer ( k ). This is because multiplying ( n ) by ( 10^k ) simply appends ( k ) zeros to the end of ( n ), which does not change the sum of its digits. Therefore, we can write:   [   frac{S(n)}{S(16n)} = frac{S(10^4 n)}{S(16n)}   ]   This implies that we can assume ( n ) is divisible by ( 625 ) (since ( 10^4 = 10000 ) and ( 10000 = 16 times 625 )).3. Let ( n = 625k ). Then we have:   [   frac{S(n)}{S(16n)} = frac{S(625k)}{S(10000k)}   ]   Since ( 10000 = 16 times 625 ), we can rewrite the expression as:   [   frac{S(625k)}{S(10000k)} = frac{S(625k)}{S(16 times 625k)} = frac{S(625k)}{S(10000k)}   ]4. Now, consider the case when ( k = 1 ). We have:   [   n = 625 quad text{and} quad 16n = 10000   ]   Therefore:   [   S(625) = 6 + 2 + 5 = 13 quad text{and} quad S(10000) = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1   ]   Thus:   [   frac{S(625)}{S(10000)} = frac{13}{1} = 13   ]5. To ensure that this is the maximum value, we need to show that ( frac{S(625k)}{S(10000k)} leq 13 ) for any positive integer ( k ). Notice that ( S(a cdot b) leq S(a) cdot S(b) ) for any integers ( a ) and ( b ). This is because the sum of the digits of a product is generally less than or equal to the product of the sums of the digits of the factors.6. Applying this to our case:   [   S(625k) leq S(625) cdot S(k) = 13 cdot S(k)   ]   and:   [   S(10000k) = S(16 cdot 625k) geq S(16) cdot S(625k) = 7 cdot S(625k)   ]   Therefore:   [   frac{S(625k)}{S(10000k)} leq frac{S(625k)}{7 cdot S(625k)} = frac{1}{7}   ]   This shows that the maximum value of ( frac{S(n)}{S(16n)} ) is indeed ( 13 ).The final answer is ( boxed{13} )."},{"problem":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b}, which of the following statements is correct?A: overrightarrow{a} cdot |overrightarrow{a}| = overrightarrow{a}^2B: (overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b})^2 = overrightarrow{a}^2 cdot overrightarrow{b}^2C: (overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b}) overrightarrow{c} = overrightarrow{a}(overrightarrow{b} cdot overrightarrow{c})D: |overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b}| leqslant |overrightarrow{a}||overrightarrow{b}|","solution":"A: overrightarrow{a} cdot |overrightarrow{a}| is a vector, while overrightarrow{a}^2 is a scalar, so the equation does not hold.B: (overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b})^2 = overrightarrow{a}^2 cdot overrightarrow{b}^2 cdot cos^2 angle (overrightarrow{a}, overrightarrow{b}).

The cut specified in the problem must pass through one of the vertices of the triangle (otherwise, two triangles will not be formed upon division). It can pass through vertex B or another vertex. In the first case (where BD is the cut line), at least one of the resulting triangles, for example, triangle BDC, will not be acute-angled, so BC is its base. Then angle DBC = angle DCB = alpha, and angle BDA = 2alpha is the exterior angle of triangle BDC. In triangle ABD, side AB cannot be the base (otherwise, from the equality DA = DB = DC, it would follow that angle B = 90^{circ}, which contradicts the condition).

Then angle A = angle BDA = 2alpha. From triangle ABC, we get 2alpha + alpha = 60^{circ}, so alpha = 20^{circ}. Thus, angle C = 20^{circ} and angle A = 40^{circ}. If BD is the base, then AB = AD (right figure). Then angle ABD = angle BDA = 2alpha. Therefore, angle B = 3alpha, so alpha = 40^{circ}, which means angle C = 40^{circ}. In the second case, the cut line must pass through the vertex of the larger of the two acute angles (where AE is the cut line, see figure). Then both resulting triangles will be obtuse-angled. In this case, AB = BE and AE = EC.

For alpha = kpi + frac{pi}{2}, sin alpha will be either 1 or -1, depending on the value of k. Specifically, when k is even, sin alpha = 1, and when k is odd, sin alpha = -1.Now, let's consider the reverse scenario where sin alpha = 1.

Applying f(0) = 1:   We substitute x = 0 into our assumed form of f(x):   f(0) = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = 1   Thus, we find that c = 1. So, our function now looks like:   f(x) = ax^2 + bx + 12. Finding f(x+1):   We calculate f(x+1) by substituting x+1 in place of x:   f(x+1) = a(x+1)^2 + b(x+1) + 1 = ax^2 + (2a+b)x + a+b+13.

Let's break this down into steps based on the provided solution:1.

To find sin x, we use the Pythagorean theorem which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Hence, we have sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1. Given cos x = frac{4}{5}, we can substitute this into the equation:   [   sin^2 x + left(frac{4}{5}right)^2 = 1   ]   Simplifying this, we get:   [   sin^2 x + frac{16}{25} = 1   ]   [   sin^2 x = 1 - frac{16}{25}   ]   [   sin^2 x = frac{9}{25}   ]   Since x is in the interval left(-frac{pi}{2}, 0right), which means x is negative and therefore sin x is negative as well (in the fourth quadrant, sine is negative and cosine is positive), we get:   [   sin x = -sqrt{frac{9}{25}} = -frac{3}{5}   ]3.

Correlation Definition:   The correlation rho between two random variables A and B is given by:   [   rho(A, B) = frac{text{Cov}(A, B)}{sqrt{text{Var}(A) text{Var}(B)}}   ]   where text{Cov}(A, B) is the covariance of A and B, and text{Var}(A) and text{Var}(B) are the variances of A and B, respectively.3. Uniform Distribution Properties:   Since U is uniformly distributed on [0, 2pi], its probability density function is:   [   f_U(u) = frac{1}{2pi}, quad 0 leq u leq 2pi   ]4. Expectation and Variance Calculations:   We need to calculate the expectations and variances of sin(nU) and sin(mU):   [   E[sin(nU)] = int_0^{2pi} sin(nu) cdot frac{1}{2pi} , du = 0   ]   because the integral of sin(nu) over a full period is zero.   Similarly,   [   E[sin(mU)] = 0   ]   The variances are:   [   text{Var}(sin(nU)) = E[sin^2(nU)] - (E[sin(nU)])^2 = E[sin^2(nU)]   ]   [   E[sin^2(nU)] = int_0^{2pi} sin^2(nu) cdot frac{1}{2pi} , du = frac{1}{2}   ]   because sin^2(x) has an average value of frac{1}{2} over a full period.   Thus,   [   text{Var}(sin(nU)) = frac{1}{2}   ]   and similarly,   [   text{Var}(sin(mU)) = frac{1}{2}   ]5. Covariance Calculation:   The covariance text{Cov}(sin(nU), sin(mU)) is:   [   text{Cov}(sin(nU), sin(mU)) = E[sin(nU) sin(mU)] - E[sin(nU)]E[sin(mU)]   ]   Since E[sin(nU)] = 0 and E[sin(mU)] = 0, we have:   [   text{Cov}(sin(nU), sin(mU)) = E[sin(nU) sin(mU)]   ]   Using the product-to-sum identities:   [   sin(nU) sin(mU) = frac{1}{2} [cos((n-m)U) - cos((n+m)U)]   ]   Therefore,   [   E[sin(nU) sin(mU)] = frac{1}{2} left( E[cos((n-m)U)] - E[cos((n+m)U)] right)   ]   Since U is uniformly distributed over [0, 2pi], the expectations of cos((n-m)U) and cos((n+m)U) are zero:   [   E[cos((n-m)U)] = 0 quad text{and} quad E[cos((n+m)U)] = 0   ]   Thus,   [   text{Cov}(sin(nU), sin(mU)) = 0   ]6. Correlation Calculation:   Finally, the correlation rho(sin(nU), sin(mU)) is:   [   rho(sin(nU), sin(mU)) = frac{text{Cov}(sin(nU), sin(mU))}{sqrt{text{Var}(sin(nU)) text{Var}(sin(mU))}} = frac{0}{sqrt{frac{1}{2} cdot frac{1}{2}}} = 0   ]7. Maximal Correlation:   Since the correlation is zero, the maximal correlation is also zero.[boxed{0}]"},{"problem":"7.051. frac{lg 8-lg (x-5)}{lg sqrt{x+7}-lg 2}=-1.","solution":"## Solution.Domain of definition: left{begin{array}{l}x-5>0,  x+7>0, quad x>5 .  sqrt{x+7} neq 2,end{array}right.## From the conditionbegin{aligned}& lg 8-lg (x-5)=lg 2-lg sqrt{x+7}, quad lg frac{8}{x-5}=lg frac{2}{sqrt{x+7}} & frac{8}{x-5}=frac{2}{sqrt{x+7}}, quad 4 sqrt{x+7}=x-5, quad 16 x+112=x^{2}-10 x+25, x>5end{aligned}We have x^{2}-26 x-87=0, from which x_{1}=29, x_{2}=-3 ; x_{2}=-3 does not satisfy the domain of definition.Answer: 29."},{"problem":"Example 11.
