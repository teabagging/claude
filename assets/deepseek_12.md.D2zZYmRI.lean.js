There are two causes: first can reflects problems with stooling, relatively common constipation and less frequently occurring encopresis (also known a fecal incontinence or soiling). Other points of view:  at the children who refuse to use the school toilet due lack of privacy,parental stress,  abnormal stretching and enlargement of the rectal area that reduces the reflex, semisolid stool,intestinal infection,  passage of painful or hard bowel movements.

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

It is a self-limiting disorder and itching can be really worrisome. I suggest you use any over the counter antihistamine if you have one with you now. You can use Hydroxyzine at 1-2mg/kg/dose (Maximum 10mg) every 6th to 8th hourly for 7 days.

Prior to the surgery, and for more than 1 year, I suffered constant fatigue , general nausea, vomiting, bouts of constipation / diarrhea . I saw both my GP and OBGYN , but neither found a cause / solution. The quality of my daily life was in the toilet (pardon the pun). One day, I pushed my chair back from the table, stood up, and a peach sized globe popped out of my navel. I pushed it back in, went to a different GP (in the same office as my original one), and he confirmed the abdominal hernia. I had surgery 2 days later. My symptoms improved, but have never disappeared. Ever since surgery, the scar has been some combination of red, inflamed, irritated, itchy, and doesn t seem to want to heal. Sometimes part of it splits open, scabs over, but always stays red. I went back to the office for post-op visits & expressed some concerns; something just didn t seem right. A nurse told me I was over-reacting and just need to relax about it. Needless to say, I haven t been back to that office for any further follow-ups. In Dec 11 I saw my dermatologist (for dyshidrotic eczema ) and, on a whim, asked about the scar. She was very concerned, mentioned keloid tissue, the need to manage the formation, care for surrounding tissue / organs, etc., and she injected quite a bit of hyaluronic acid into the scar, in different parts of my navel, & into the skin surrounding the scar (the scar is just over 1 long, just below my navel). It didn t take long to notice the hard tissue under my skin disappearing. Now, the hard tissue is back, the scar is red and itchy, and I m suffering bouts of fatigue and diarrhea. Are these occurrences related to the mesh? What should be my next step? Visit my Dr. (that confirmed the hernia) and ask for a CT or MRI? How are culprits to abdominal distress discovered and treated? Thanks in advance for your insight and advice.","Doctor":"Hi.As per your question,any injury/incision over your body leads to keloid formation.It cant be prevented.It should be managed only with Intra keloidal injections.Regarding red scar,it may be due to underlying mesh.But diarrhoea may not be due to mesh,as the mesh will be fixed to surrounding structures with Non absorbable sutures.As mesh is a foreign body,it may lead to infection.So,Clinical examination should be done first.CT/MRI are not needed now."},{"Patient":"My baby is 5 weeks old and has white powder sugar looking clumps scattered throughout his stools.

Now the fever is back to 103.  She has a swollen gland on the on side of her face and has had a rash on her belly for several weeks.  My daughter had her to the Dr. on Monday and was told it was a virus and that it would run its course.......She also has a cough that is horrible at night and her eyes are watery and reddish.  Is there such a virus going around so to speak?","Doctor":"High fever and swollen lymph nodes are mostly due to some viral or bacterial infection for which you can give her some antibiotic preferably moxikind-cv or zifi-cv after an expert advice along with brufen junior or tynol-plus for high grade fever. For cough you can give her syrup bro-zedex or syrup asthakind. Do cold sponging to reduce the temperature of her body."},{"Patient":"how do I ease my 10 month old infant.  Sat.

Minimal fever.","Doctor":"For treatment of ear ache in child you can give him some antibiotic preferably moxikind-cv or zifi-cv after an expert advice along with ibugesic-plus or brufen junior for swelling and inflammation. Use gatiflox or soliwax ear drops to put into his ear four to five times daily.

What can I do? I'm really worried.","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.By what you quote I put forth these possibilities - 1. Congenital airway anomaly - this causes noisy breathing (both inspiratory and expiratory noise, actually inspiratory will be more than expiratory noise). But the child will not struggle to breath and there will not be fast breathing and in-drawing of chest wall. The sound will be more heard during sleeping and feeding.2. Wheezing - Here the sound will be predominantly expiratory; the kid will be struggling to breathe, might turn blue and require oxygen and may have chest wall in-drawing.But both are associated with recurrent cough and cold. But these might not always be bacterial infections which require antibiotics and usually are predominantly viral and are self-limiting.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

My 2 year old son has never been a good eater from ime we started baby food until now it has been an ongg daily struggle to get nutrition in him. He has always been in a low percentile for his weight and had monthly weight checks with his pediatrician, who seems to be unable to help us figure out why our son will not eat. He refuses to eat for hours on end has no interest in food at all never acts the least bit hungry as if he has no appetite. We have tried every trick in the book. We have asked for and received no help from his pediatrician and he sees a occupational therapist weekly who too has tried every trick in the book to try and get him to eat. We are completely at a loss of what to do and thought at this point we would see what a gastro dr may have to say. So what do you think may be going on and do you have any ideas of what we can do to help increase appetite?","Doctor":"Hi. I completely understand your concern. But I would like to first reassure you that it's a very common problem in Pediatrics and very rarely do we find a physiological or anatomical cause for poor appetite or weight gain. Though I don't know your son's present weight I would like to give you certain clues to judge if his lack of weight gain is worrisome or not. 1. Any issues during your pregnancy or delivery? 2.wat was his birth weight and how was his initial one month of life?3.Did you breastfeed him and how long you did exclusive breastfeeding? 4.Wat diet do you give him usually? 5.Does his weight fall between 10 to 12 kg at present?  Or  Has his birth weight increased by approximately 3 times plus a kilo for now? 6. Wat's the usual weight and height stature of you and your spouse? 7.Does his height approximately falls between 75 to 90 cm?8.Are all the milestones in him age appropriate? 9.Has he been hospitalized ever for any major issues? Just check out the above and get back to us..You will get a rough picture of your son's health status. I would be pleased to clarify any further doubts.

If the kid is active you need not worry about taking to emergency room.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days.

Don't worry. This age group children are prone to self limiting viral infections. There is no need to treat each and every episode of fever with antibiotics. These infections need just symptomatic treatment and improve. In case your daughter has recurrent illness associated with stomachache, then do test her stools for parasitic infestations and urine for any infection. As these are common reasons for such symptoms. If present, you may treat parasitic infestation by drugs like Albendazole, tinidazole, or metronidazole after consulting your pediatrician. Urine infection if present will require a proper course of antibiotics based on culture report. Sometimes the reason of stomachache can be gastritis associated with poor oral intake and antipyretic drugs.

The causes of interstitial lung disease with lymphoid hyperplasia and granulomas can be due to infection (tuberculosis or fungal) or inflammation associated with any autoimmune diseases such as sarcoidosis.

Not full blown hernia but was told it was a pre-hernia. I now have a bulge when I do sit-ups but not otherwise though I often have an ache in the area. When I have to push hard during a bowel movement I also feel like something is trying to push out through my belly button but it goes away after bowel movement is done. I ve been told that I have to wait for it to finally rip and push through before anything can be done. Is this true? are there exercises or other things I can do to help prevent this? Should it be affecting my ability to perform sexually? I am 46 yr old, Caucasian male, 6 1 , 255 lbs, w/ good health history otherwise other than elevated blood pressure and cholesterol . I work as a corrections officer and wear a duty belt if that is relevant.","Doctor":"Hello, pirate, From your description, it appears you have a gap between two portions of the abdominal muscle called the Rectus muscle. What is happening is, you have developed a condition called \\"Divarication Recti \\" which is a kind of hernia that gets aggravated with any activitivity that increses intra abdominal pressure, like heavy coughing, sneezing or lifting weights, or build up of intestinal gas. An abdominal binder (Velcro) will be helpful when you do any excercises such as weight lifting or push ups. In some cases , if the bulging from internal organs get stuck , that could create a problem and that is an indication for surgery. They can do a mesh repair. Sexual activity, again can make the hernia worse . But the abdominal binder should help. Hope this helps.

My 12 year old son had pityrissis rosea 3 to 4 weeks ago. Most of the spots are fading including the herald patch on his chest.

I was continuing my medications for 2 months & left . I started it again & it almost 6 months completed till now. Now I am feeling a slight pain in my right & left lower abdomen . would this be a mittelschmerz or stomach tb. Kindly advise.","Doctor":"Hi Indirakonar, As you told that you have been operated for the TB node in the chest and after taking medication for 2 months you left it and again completed the course for 6 months. From this I understand that this is TB of lymphe nodes and not the lung and you have to surgically remove the node also. It is common that TB medication for TB of other part of the body apart from the lung is for long duration and should be stopped only after consultation with your doctor only. Now the pain in the abdomen can be because of recurrence of this or because of some other thing. I would suggest you to consult your doctor to make the confirmation and have the investigations done and keep monitoring yourself.

Her birth weight was 3.5 kg, current weight 11.8 kg. She s on breast feeding & solids. She had been suffering from cold & cough for the past 4 days. At first we tried giving T-minic drops alongwith the Nasoclear nasal drops(prescribed by one doctor). When her symptoms got bad, there were coughing fits & audible wheezing, we consulted another paediatrician who s also a professor of paediatrics. After check-up(by stethoscope), he also used a device(that i later understood was a pulse oximeter), the readings were 95 & 70,(the sensor was put on her finger & toe respectively). The doctor appeared to be busy not allowing us time to ask questions or doubts. While he never explained anything regarding the findings, except that it should be 99 instead of 95,and that there was heavy phlegm in her chest built up due to cough syrups. He later proceeded to give the following list of medicines to take: 1. Montair LC kid 5ml @ N for 30 days 2. Liquid Advent Forte Syrup 2.5ml @M & N for 6 days 3. Liquid AB Phylline 10mg/ml 2.5ml @M & N for 7 days 4. Ivepread tablet4 @M-A-E-N for 3 days 5. Liquid Ceroplox 100 2.5ml @M & E There s no immediate family history of obesity, sugar or asthma(but my husband s grandmother had asthma, i don t know if that counts!). I would first of all, like to know, if it s safe for her to take so many medicines. It s extremely difficult to administer any of the above medicines(esp. the tablet which dissolved in water, is too bitter for my liking!) In just half a day s dosage administering, she s begun to show disinterest in eating & feeding breast milk. During the night, she also threw up twice(part of her solid intake & the other time, her breast feed!!) Does this mean, we should stop(any or all)the medicines?? Won t she have side effects? How to continue if her appetite s affected & her vomiting increases?

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

There is no need to use antibiotics (LIKE NORMET) unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment.

Although H.PYLORI can be eradicated completely but it is not certain that just one course of antibiotics may treat up completely.Many times therapy is repeated is again. If 2 therapies fail,then your doctor may wish to perform endoscopy and biopsy with culture to check the antibiotic susceptibilities./ sensitivities of the H.pylori strain you have. After Knowing the antibiotic sensitivity profile of the H.pylori strain you have been infected with the doctor can then treat you with the most appropriate antibiotic combination that will get rid of the H.pylori you have. 2...once the germ is eradicated,your ulcer would heal completely. 3...

It's especially common after DPT vaccine given at the age of your child. So don't worry.Infants show great variations in colour, consistency and frequency of stools. Also, most infections of gut in this age are due to self limiting viral infections. So, is your baby is feeding well, active, alert and passing atleast 6-8 times urine per day.

Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment.

This is one viral illness among all other exanthemas which can cause fever followed by rash over palms and soles. It is a self-limiting disorder and itching can be really worrisome. I suggest you use any over the counter antihistamine if you have one with you now. You can use Hydroxyzine at 1-2mg/kg/dose (Maximum 10mg) every 6th to 8th hourly for 7 days. This can even cause some peeling of skin in the next 4-6 weeks and do not worry about it.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hello.. I have a warm sensation in the lower right side of my stomach , I ve been doing some reading and see that it could be appendicitis . The pain isn t extremely discomforting, it s a bit frustrating if anything because I m constantly shuffling around to attempt to make it feel better. I ve gone to the bathroom with diarrhea , thinking it was the food, but this pain just started happening after the food as well. I ve noticed I ve been urinating considerably more then usual as well.

According to the result she's having a high quantity of fat globules. 4 days ago shes suffering high fever with vomiting and diarehea.Previously today she's in good shape without fever and vomiting but diarehea still there and her latest result as mentioned above. Please advice. Thanks","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.It seems your kid is having viral diarrhoea. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do. Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridges & soups.Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Health care magic are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer.

Many times as doctors we should know when to give antibiotics and most importantly when to restrain ourselves form giving antibiotics. But a decision of whether to give antibiotic or not has to be taken only after doing an otoscpy of seeing the ear drum by an otoscope.

Your child seems to be suffering from the allergic tendency leading to recurrent cough and chest congestion. If not timely managed, such cases may progress to childhood asthma. Inducing vomiting with lemon and honey is not a solution at all. I would recommend you to take him to a pediatrician for proper clinical examination especially of chest to rule out pulmonary wheeze or any congenital heart disease leading to recurrent cough.They may advice you for chest X Ray. In case of pulmonary wheeze, treatment with inhaled steroids and Beta2 agonist drugs will be helpful.Hopefully this will help you.

Whenever he consumes any of these medicines (in suspension form), in two days time, he starts getting rashes through out his face and body which lasts for more than 2 weeks. We requested doctor to give him some antibiotic which avoids this side effect.","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMSince your child is suffering from allergic tendency to amoxicillin and azithrimycin, it's advisable to avoid any drugs from these groups ( penicillin and macrolides) in any future infections. There are other groups of antibiotics which can be given to him in case of any infections after proper physician consultation. Kindly elaborate this allergic history  to his treating physician in future.Allergic reaction occurs due to release of histamines and other inflammatory mediators from our bodies when exposed to the allergens. So, antihistamine such as Chlorpheniramine, Loratidine, cetirizine are useful for treating such episodes. In case the episode turns very severe with breathing problems, always take him to ER immediately for emergency treatment.Hopefully this will help you.

From your description I think your son has got cystitis which means inflammation of the urinary bladder due to some infection. The same if persistent for a long time can lead to changes in the kidneys causing such picture. If your son's growth and weight is appropriate for his age, it means that it's not a prolonged problem affecting the kidneys.

If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do.

This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed him calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.PLEASE DO NOT GIVE ANY SO CALLED APPETITE STIMULANTS AS THEY ARE NOT VERY SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN AND THEY HAVE THE SIDE EFFECT OF EXCESSIVE DROWSINESS.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi I have the last few weeks had a sharp pain in my upper abdoman (centre) and a dull pain on the side, changing from left to right..just under my chest/ribs I also feel dizzy and like im a bit drunk...

Regards, Jayasimha","Doctor":"thanks for asking I gone through your question. your 4 days baby is having albinism. ( are you sure for diagnosis? Because albinism is a genetic disorder, treatment is limited. But getting proper eye care and monitoring skin for signs of abnormalities are especially important to your child's health.Your child will most likely need to wear prescription lenses, and he or she should receive annual eye exams by an ophthalmologist. Although surgery is rarely part of treatment for albinism, your ophthalmologist may recommend surgery on optical muscles to minimize nystagmus. Surgery to correct strabismus may make the condition less noticeable, but it won't improve vision.dermatologist  should conduct an annual assessment of your child's skin to screen for skin cancer or lesions that can lead to cancer. Adults with albinism need annual eye and skin exams throughout their lives.hope i able to answer your query"},{"Patient":"good morning doctor: My son william is three years and half old.

You should be worried but not too much. The blotches are simply our skin's way of reacting to certain irritants, infections,allergens or hormonal changes. Children are more sensitive to chemicals, viruses and bugs than we are. The blotches can be sign of sweat rash, eczema,  impetigo, skin infection. Because it can be difficult to distinguish one type from another, you can discuss it with a pediatrician or pediatric dermatologist. If your baby has itchiness we should exclude contact dermatitis, eczema, fifth disease, impetigo, poison ivy, scarlet fever.The most common cause is allergy,i suggest:-Fenistil- single dose=amount of drops =amount of kg of baby three times daily.-Hypoallergenic diet to breastfeeding mother and baby.If it is just sweat rash-use antifungal Candid powder.Hope this answers your question.

My 11 months old  had got loose motions for last 2 weeks. Dr said it was stomach flue and treated him for the same. He got better since Monday. On Thursday I fed him little banana and his loose motions have started again. Can the symptoms return? I have sporlac powder. Will that help? Please advise urgently","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have gone through your question and understand your concerns. In the meantime you can certainly supplement the diet with the sporlac powder. It will help. As you know Sporlac provides active cultures of healthy micro nutrients which helps restore the normal balance of bacteria in the colon. It is also very important to consider the hydration status of the baby. Do your best to make sure adequate fluids and foods are taken in. This will help avoid dehydration. Does he have any blood or mucus in the stool. In such a case this is called dysentery and antibiotics may be required. Is he passing watery stool? If he is having watery stool several times then he should be monitored for dehydration. Oral rehydration solution or any other solution containing salt and sugar should be given. Zinc (Z&D) prescribed by your doctor will be useful. Continue to ask further queries as required. Hope this helps. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Svetlana Shrivastva"},{"Patient":"My 11 week old breast fed baby has had green stools on and off for a week.

It is about the diameter of a golf ball and is slightly raised. She has had it now for about three weeks. We thought it had gone away, but just noticed it again today. Any assistance with this matter would be very much appreciated.","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMYour daughter seems to be suffering from hemangioma. Hemangiomas are a type of vascular malformation. They commonly appear during infancy. After going through a growth phase, they become static for some time. There after 50% hemangiomas disappear by 5 year of age and almost 90% improve by 9 years of age. Although they look painful, but rarely cause discomfort. Treatments are aimed at shrinking or removing the growth if they persist. Laser surgery can be used to remove a large hemangioma of the skin that is uncomfortable or is causing any problems. Laser treatments can also be used to reduce remaining discoloration after a hemangioma has healed.Hopefully this will help you.

His birth weight was 2.85kg which went down to 2.4kg by 7th day. He developed hyperbilirubinemia on the 3rd day and required 48 hours of phototherapy ( TC bilirubin was 15.4 on 3rd day and came down to 12.8 on 4th day evening) and then we came home. However he turned yellow again on 8th day and bilirubin count went up to 19.4, So our peadiatrician asked us to admit him for additional phototherapy session . At the end of 2nd day of therapy, TC bilirubin came down to  9.8 and we can back home again (on 10th day). Since then: - He is feeding well and passing urne 6/8 times a day and passing yellow stools on alternate days - He has gained some weight and now weighs about 2.9 Kgs - His palm and soles are pinkish, but face, white of the eye and gums still have some yellow tinge Questions: Is this a cause of concern? Do we need to repeat the bilirubin test? Is his weight gain fair enough? Any other suggestions? Thanks for you advice","Doctor":"Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns.Hyperbilirubinemia is a very much common in all the children.It is due to prematurity of the liver.It is even common in baby with regular dates born.Check for RH INCOMPATIBILITY and  ABO INCOMPATIBILITY.The pattern of onset ,day , severity,blood bilirubin levels are important.Your baby is absolutely fine.There is no need to get tense.If you have any symptoms like vomiting ,dark coloured urine and stools, abdominal bloating, then you should consult physician.Continue exposing the baby natural sun daily in the ear;y mornings.Repeat the test after 1 month(if recommended).About weight growth it is absolutely fine.Initially in the first week there will be fluid dehydration and weight loss common.Now the baby is having good weight.Hope this answers your question.

Amebic cysts are not killed by soap or low concentrations of chlorine or iodine; therefore, water ( if you live in endemic area ) should be boiled for more than 1 minute and vegetables should be washed with a detergent soap and soaked in acetic acid or vinegar for 10-15 minutes before consumption.In humans, natural E histolytica infection does not seem to result in long-term immunity: individuals with a previous amebic liver abscess are as susceptible to a new infection as other members of the population are.Hopefully this will help you.

All that means is that you have some degree of inflammation, regardless of the location. If you are following the above guide lines , and still having same symptoms, you should make another appointment with the GI doctor for re-evaluation. Some times , changing to a different PPI might work. I wish you well."},{"Patient":"My friend s grandson was born three weeks ago..he was 7lbs 2 oz..all signs were normal, Apgar at 9 & 8...they said the baby had a low rbc and needed to stay for observation.

It seems that your child is suffering from an episode of hematuria most likely due to a urinary tract infection (UTI).I see such cases in my clinical practice and recommend the following measures:1. Laboratory investigation including--complete blood count with differentials-S. Creatinine and BUN- Urine culture and sensitivity- Ultrasound KUB- Renal scan after 3 months of the episode if UTI confirmed.2. Start on antibiotics such as Cefixime, Coamoxiclav , ofloxacin etc depending upon the culture report.Ranal scan and ultrasound KUB are done to rule out the predisposing underlying pathology for UTI and the injuries secondary to UTI.Hopefully this will help you.

We thought it was chick pox, but no watery blister. Now it back on his bum cheaks again","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMI have gone through your question and understand your concerns. It seems that your son is suffering from fungal (Candida albicans ) nappy rash. The main cause of nappy rash is wetness from contact with wee and poo in a nappy. Newborns wee often and do frequent, runny poos.  Even the most absorbent nappy leaves some moisture on a baby's delicate new skin. This then makes it harder for your baby's skin to work as a barrier, making it more likely her skin will become irritated. You may take the following measures to treat him:-Keep your baby clean and dry by changing her nappy frequently. -Clean your baby's bottom using fragrance-free and alcohol-free baby wipes (check the label) or a mild, moisturising cleanser. Rinse your baby's bottom in plain water and pat her skin dry.-Give your baby as much nappy-free time as possible, to allow the air to aid healing.-Apply a thin layer of barrier cream or ointment before putting on a clean nappy.Apply Nystatin lotion over the area to treat the present yeast infection.If your baby's nappy rash is the result of an allergy, the problem should clear up on its own as long as you don't use the product that set off the rash. Hopefully this will help you. I would be happy to help you in any further questions.Take care"},{"Patient":"My 5 yr old son, with autism, feels cold to the touch, he seems to have a bit of a stomach issue, no vomiting, just loss of appetite and cranky and lethargic , is eating a few things, temp was 97 just concerned - he is non verbal non receptive, so hard to get good answers ;(","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMI completely understand your concerns but don't worry. The most common reason for such symptoms in this age group is self limiting viral infection. They usually improve over a period of few days with symptomatic management.Also, the temperature of 97 degrees Fahrenheit is perfectly normal. I would suggest you to start him on a probiotic such as enterogermina twice daily along with antacids such as Ranitidine or lansoprazole.Hopefully this will boost up his appetite. Offer him regular feeds and oral fluids to prevent dehydration and lethargy.You may use acetaminophen or ibuprofen in case of fever episodes if they occurs.Hopefully this will help you.

It seems that your nephew had first episode of generalised seizure. It's very important to go for electroencephalogram (EEG) to check the reason for seizures. Also, a family history of seizures, certain drugs and electrolyte imbalances, perinatal risk factors can predispose a child to seizure disorder or epilepsy.I would recommend you to take him to a paediatric neurologist for complete physical examination and lab evaluation. He may even start certain anti epileptic drugs to prevent any further such episodes.Hopefully this will help you.

I feel that your baby is having cow's milk protein allergy. Unusually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds.  3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4. If you feel your feeds alone are inadequate for the baby, then Zerolac is the only option till 6 months age.

Infants can have wide variation in poops in terms of frequency, consistency and colour. It's not recommended to treat an infant not passing stools up to a week unless and until he has any other associated symptoms such as refusal to feeds, vomiting, abdominal distension etc.But since your baby has hard stools and has marked difficulty in passing stools along with blood stains, I would recommend you to use per rectal glycerin suppository to help it. Glycerin works by osmotic effects. Do not use it more than once a day. Also, try to establish exclusive breastfeeding as it has less chances of constipation in baby.

These spells aren't intentional — they're an involuntary reflex, which means kids have no control over them. Although very disturbing to parents, but they pose no serious health risks. A spell typically lasts less than a minute before a child resumes breathing normally.Breath-holding spells can happen in healthy children. They can be more common in kids with a family history of them.In most cases, breath-holding spells can be predicted and even prevented once triggers are identified. Kids usually outgrow them by age 5 or 6.I would recommend you to take her to your pediatrician to rule out any arrhythmias, seizures or iron deficiency anemia. As they also present in a similar way.

Remove it and get it examined under microscope by your pediatrician the next day for sticking eggs or pin worm. To treat it completely I recommend my patients to take Albendazole (400 mg) on day 1 and 15. This should be along with trimming nails and good hand washing and hygiene.For allergic reaction, you may give your son Syp. Benadryl or Chlorpheniramine. Apply lacto- calamine lotion on the skin lesions. It will reduce itching and redness.Hopefully this will help you. I would be glad to help you in any further questions.Take care"},{"Patient":"My one month old baby is having problem with stool, he's on formula also on breast fed he's having enfalac which was working out quite well but since last two days he hasn't poo. What shall I do .he cries and is very cranky also gives alot of pressure when he wants to poo but doesn't help.","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMI completely understand your concerns but don't worry. Infants can have wide variations in frequency, consistency and colour of poops. The most common reason for hard stools is dehydration or concentrated formula feeds.I would recommend you to try for exclusive breastfeeding as it is easier to digest and good in long term. In case you have to continue formula feeds, then give with proper constitution and hygiene. Ensure regular feeds to avoid dehydration.Hopefully this will help. I would be happy to help you out in any future health related questions.Take care"},{"Patient":"Hello Dr., I am 35 yr old male. I have been having ongoing episodes of pain in the middle of my upper abdomin just below the ribs. I also feel a pain in the upper middle of my back as well. These episodes begin about 3 hours after I eat. They would occurr randomly every few weeks, until end of novemer, and I had several attacks over a few days. I went to my family practice doc, and they found that amylese and lipese were elevated. They gave me miralax and I returned 5 days later and levels back to normal. I have since had 3 attacks, until yesterday. I have now had 4 attacks. Usually for relief I vomit , drink water, and vomit again. I usually have to repeat 3 times before I get relief. It is now a holiday, and am gauranted a fun ride for at least a couple more days. I plan on marching into the ER when I m done with work, any ideas?","Doctor":"Hello, anthony5o, The location of the pain with some radiation to the back and the recurrent nature of the pain indicates, that you are sufferring from recurrent Acute Pancreatitis, inflammation of your pancreas. Elevated Amylase and Lipase supports this diagnosis. Now, as to the cause of this, there are many. One is alcohol excess, second is associated gallbladder problems, there are Viral infections, auto-immune causes also for this. There is also a small percentage of patients who don't really have a cause and this is called \\"Idiopathic\\". You have had classical symptoms of nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. I don't think miralax is going to cure this. You need to have a gallbladder sonogram and a CT-Scan of the abdomen to get a good look at the pancreas. Depending on the findings, you may need additional studies and treatment. Please have these done ASAP.

By what you quote I feel that your kid might be having a viral illness...headache at the height of fever is quite common in this.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days.

Once answered, can you also tell me what your qualifications are? My fiance underwent an emergency surgery on October 20, 2012. She had severe stomach pain and admitted herself to the Emergency Room on Fort Bragg at Womack Army Medical Center. I was away for training and unable to come home because we are not married yet. It was found that she had three ovarian cysts and they caused her appendix to burst. The surgeon removed the cysts and her appendix. Following the surgery, she has continually had stomach pain on a regular basis. This past week we admitted her to the emergency room again when the pain became too much for her to bear. Following the same tests that she had the originally had, it has been found that she has 3 more cysts on the same ovary in relatively the same spot. So after giving a brief description of her medical history, my question is this.....Would my fiance benefit from having someone around to take care of her medical needs while she is awaiting additional treatment for her ovarian cysts? As of right now, I am required to perform extra duties on base and I am unable to care for her whatsoever. So in your medical opinion, would it be safer and make sense for my fiance to have me around as much as possible to care for her medical needs and take her to her appointments, or to the Emergency Room if necessary instead of her driving herself when her pain becomes too much for her to cope with?","Doctor":"Dear sir, as I understand you want to know is it necessary  to be with your fiance while she s having ovarian cyst? Well, you should know that problem comes when ovarian cyst rupture or become torsioned; this will cause sharp pain in lower abdomen and peritoneal inflammation  which needs to be treated surgically in most cases. It can rupture today or never. Usually her gynecologist needs to plan her treatment and follow the size of these cysts. If it becomes too large it can be laparoscopicaly removed. So my conclusion is that you dont need to be around her all the time because many women have these kind of cyst and dont even know it. Also every human can have appendicitis at any time without any risk factors so it doesnt mean that every men needs to have someone around him all the time.  If she s gonna need the emergency procedure for her disease she will definitely be able to drive or make a phone call. Ovarian and appendix inflammation develops through 6-12 hours or even days...

He and Dad chased and caught it. While doing so Grandson immediately lost all feeling in both hands simultaneously, became nauseated, dizzy, faint, lost his peripheral vision, speech became slowed, and had severe headache. Immediately went to ER, Akron, Ohio Children s Hospital. Peripheral vision and slow speech returned to normal within an hour. All vitals normal, except BP 122/86. Blood work ok (don t know how extensive it was), MRI clear, nothing abnormal, and Neurologist ruled out stroke, brain bleed, meningitis. Started Rabies treatment immediately (first 4 shots). Both hands were fully functional--good grip, could right, feed himself, pick object up. He was talking, happy, felt good, except for no feeling in hands and headache ( 5 on scale of 1-10). By 7:30 p.m., feeling returned to left index finger. Neurologist felt he had a migraine. Never had migraines prior.

Started using 1 or 2 word responses instead of sentences. Seemed dazed. Tried to sleep, but kept jerking awake every 5-6 minutes. Could no longer walk, as legs wobbly, and gave out when he tried to stand. Began missing mouth when feeding himself. Neurologist stopped all meds except stronger Tylenol and gave him a glucose IV to hydrate and flush overnight. This morning he was the same. Rabies test negative.

As long as your child doesn't vomit or her motions don't contain blood or her feeding is problematic you need not panic. The symptoms can persist upto few minutes or maximum 2 to 3 hours and will subside on its own. It doesn't warrant any treatment.

Yeast in stools in an active child with no other illness is a perfectly normal finding. It just happens because it may be a part of normal gut flora. There is no need for treatment.Normally, infants show great variations in poops in terms of frequency, consistency and colour. Green poops usually occur due to excess lactose in feeds. In a breast fed child it's due to more intake of fore milk than hind milk. So, just a proper and complete breastfeeding can easily treat your nephew.

Typical symptoms of colon cancer are: blood mixed with the stool, abdominal pain, constipations or/and diarrheas, weight lost. Your symptoms are very characteristic for hemorrhoids. Your symptoms can be also caused by inflammatory bowel diseases. If you are really worried, I suggest you to have performed fecal occulted test (before it you should not eat meat for 3 days, this test should be repeated 3 times). To improve hemorrhoids condition, it is advisable to prevent constipations (increase fiber rich products and mineral water intake), avoid fatty foods and soft drinks, have sitz baths with Quercus Cortex and use hemorrhoids suppositories.

Its onset can occur at any age and developmental stage. Increased sweating may be triggered by certain things such as anxiety, spicy foods, cola drinks, exercise, warm air temperature, and fever. You may or may not be able to identify a specific trigger in your child. You should see a doctor if you think that the amount of sweat being produced is more than is needed to keep the body at a constant temperature. WIth his obesity ( you have not mentioned his weight and family history ) we have to investigate for Type 1 Diabetes in him esp if any family member had it. Please come back with all details as on a personal talk with your doctor. Just asking a few questions online cannot help give a scientific answer. Regards. YOu have already discussed with many doctors  and I hope they have asked  some questions before asking any  test and deciding  on their action. Take care."},{"Patient":"My toddler has a fever and foul smelling gas. The gas has been going on for a week, since he got off of antibiotics.

Donot self medicate especiaaly with pain killers and steroids Regarding your low back pain, it will be helpful if you tell more about it like - - Whether it increases on bending? - Any history of heavy weight lifting or trauma? - Whether any abnormality is noticed in urine like decrease in amount or pain or burning sensation while urinating? Though the pain can be muscular and can be relieved by giving rest to your body and applying local pain relieving gel after hot fomentation, still you should get yourself investigated for the function of the kidney. So get your blood tested for Renal Profile and your urine for Routine and Microscopic examination. Treatment can be planned according to the reports of the investigation.

You are suffering from either chronic functional abdominal pain or chronic irritable bowel diseases that if investigated clinically and para-clinically ( i.e laboratory tests, radiology e.g endoscopy, colonoscopy, abdomino-pelvic ultrasound, abdominal CT or MRI etc) we shall probably find no cause such as an infection or tumor etc. This means your problem might be of nervous or genetic origin and will need specialist doctors on the domain of chronic abdominal pain. In the mean time, the pain could be controlled by using low dose antidepressants such as amitriptyline + anti-spasmodic at time of crisis. If you are a female, you will need to visit a gyobs for evaluation of your pelvis ( reproductive structures). If you are fortunate and a cause of your problem can be identified by the doctors, then you will probably get a cure. Also, you will probably need to check on the meals you eat and see if there is any particular dish or food type which when eaten has a greater tendency of causing the pain. Also peptic ulcer disease/gastritis needs to be investigated. A stool exams and culture will be paramount to rule out any infections.

They respond very well to just symptomatic management. So, I would recommend you to give her an antihistamine drops at recommended dose as per weight and age along with regular feeds and fluids to maintain hydration.Also, you may use normal saline nasal drops regularly as they are the safest for clearing blocked nose.Use a room humidifier while sleeping if the weather is dry.Hopefully this will help you.I will be happy to help you in any further questions.Take care"},{"Patient":"Hi my sister is 12 yrs old and she had a sudden cough with wheezing last night.

Don't worry the weight of your baby is not that bad. Usually weight at this age should be around 3 times the birth weight.

It's advisable to eat from family pot I.e make your baby sit and eat when whole family eats atleast 3 meals a day. Offer all the staple food that you eat routinely.

It seems that your child is suffering from an inflammatory reaction secondary to an insect bite. Many a times, our bodies release inflammatory mediators especially histamines in response to the insect bites. These lead to such type of skin lesions which are usually associated with irritation and prone to abrasion by itching. Due to inflammation, mild fevers are normal association. So, I would recommend you to use Lactocalamine for local application on skin lesion 3-4 times a day for soothing and early healing.You may give your baby acetaminophen or ibuprofen syrup for fever is it occurs and repeat the dose after 6-8 hours if fever persists. In case the inflammation is more, also start an antihistamine such as Benadryl or Chlorpheniramine.Hopefully this will help.

Actually, interest in sex increases and children may begin to experiment with sexual behaviors with other children.Puberty can begin as early as age nine; with the onset of puberty, boys are able to ejaculate and have “wet dreams.”“Locker room behavior” is quite common, including comparing genital size and function.Older children in this age range may begin to experiment with “petting” over and under clothes, French kissing, and touching or rubbing each other’s bodies.Masturbation may be a preferred pastime.Children may simulate intercourse (dry humping).Parents can be instrumental in encouraging their children’s sexual development in positive ways. Generally speaking we should explain, that adults need it for creation family and delivery children, that now he should study to be independent, then you can marry.Just  stay calm, don\\"t show real emotions .

Mu oncologist says they may be over treating me and want me to have this chemo as there was extensive desease outside the ovary - however nothing invasive showed up from the labs ??????? help","Doctor":"Dear madam. I understand you and your concern, but it is not possible to evaluate agressivity of tumor by lab parameters. It can be evaluated only by surgeon during the procedure and PHD analysis. Stage IIIc means serious involvement of ovary and structures around it or lymph nodes. It needs to be treated more agresively than stage II and i recommend you to do chemotherapy despite its complications. Ovarian cancers  unfortunately are almost the worst ones and you shouldnt do any compromise. Even if it seems to be borderline without detected invasive implants there can be some micro-metastasis which wont be seen during the surgical procedure. Chemoth can be very preventive and therapeutic and you will feel safer.

There is no fever","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCM The symptoms in your child seems to be more of lactose intolerance rather than cow milk allergy. Lactose intolerance is triggered by the lactose sugar in cow’s milk. In people with lactose intolerance, the digestive system can’t fully digest this milk sugar, because it doesn’t make enough of the lactase enzyme. So instead of being digested and absorbed, the lactose stays in the gut and feeds the gut bacteria, which release acids and gases that cause the symptoms of lactose intolerance. Sometimes even high carbohydrate diet may lead to similar symptoms.As most of the cases of lactose intolerance are temperory, I would recommend you to give your child a well balanced diet without milk and excess carbohydrates for the time being. You may gradually introduce milk after a week.Also, probiotics such as enterogermina will be useful.Hopefully this will be helpful. I will be happy to answer any further questions.Take care"},{"Patient":"My 2 year old son has seemed to be bitten by something multiple times on his back and belly, but mainly on his neck. These bites look like mosquito bites or welts with black area around where bitten. Kinda looks likr a stinger bit not positive. Any ideas of what this is or how to get rid of them?","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCM I have gone through your question and understand your concerns. But don't worry. Many a times due to allergic reaction of our body with release of histamines, such reactions can appear. Although it's very difficult for anyone to tell the name of insect responsible by looking at the lesions. The treatment remains almost same.You need to apply Lactocalamine lotion over the skin lesions 3-4 times daily to help in early healing and reduce irritation.If the child is restless due to itching or irritation, you may give him an antihistamine such as Syp. Benadryl or Chlorpheniramine.Trim his nails at the same time.Hopefully this will help. I would be happy to help you in future for any queries.Take care"},{"Patient":"I just notice a small bruise on my 8 month old sons arm with a tiny red dot in the middle. The bruise or the dot are not swollen, are not hot to the touch, and do not seem to be bothering him in anyway. But I am worried. It does not appear to be a spider bite, but then again I have never seen a bite right after it happened only after it got bad. The red mark though is not an open wound, but more like a tiny red dot that appears, it does not look as though it is puss feeled or anything, just a bruised circle with a red dot. I am bit on the worrying because my daught seems to always get sick but lately since she has gotten older seems to be growing out of it, I only hope my son will not be the same way. I am just concerned as to what could have caused this bruise even if it is nothing.","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMI have gone through the question and understand  your concerns. But don't worry. The lesions as described seems to be due to insect bite. If it's not bothering him, then there is nothing to be worried about. Many a times our body releases histamines in response to the insect bites including mosquitoes. This leaves to such type of reactions on skin. You may apply lactocalamine lotion on the lesion to make it heal faster. Trim the nails of your son to prevent undue abrasion due to itching. Give him antihustamines such as Syp Benadryl or Chlorpheniramine if he seems to be irritated by the lesions.Hopefully this will help you. I would be happy to help you in any further questions.Take care"},{"Patient":"Hi my 10month old baby has had a temperature over the past 24 hrs however this has come down with the use of Calpol. Overnight I noticed red spots on her bum and legs, but they do blanch. They don't look like measles. Any ideas as to what it is, as I am nervous for her. Thank you.","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMI have gone through your question. Don't worry. The red spots on skin which blanch are usually suggestive of insect or mosquito bites. It occurs due to release of histamines in response to bites leading to dilated blood capillary. It subsides usually over a couple of days.You may apply Lactocalamine lotion for early resolution of skin lesions.You are right that they are not due to measles. Measles rashes appear on 3rd day of fever.For fever continue calpol. You may repeat the dose every 6-8 hourly if fever persists. Most common reason for fever in this age is self limiting viral infections. But in case it doesn't resolve over next 3-4 days or there are any new symptoms, then do visit your pediatrician. Hopefully this will help you.Take care"},{"Patient":"My son is 3 Years and has been diagnosed with Nafrotic Syndrome with Minimum Change. He has been prescribed 30mg per day Omnacortil syrup for 4 weeks and then subsequent reduction of the doze. What will be the side effects of this Steroid ? Please advise as I am really concerned about the consequences.","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMI completely understand your concern regarding steroid use for Nephrotic syndrome in your child. But don't worry as this is the best first line treatment for minimal change type of nephrotic syndrome. The side effects are not common during the treatment that your child is receiving at present. Long term therapy with steroids may lead to increased appetite, cushingoid features, impaired growth, behavioural changes, gastritis, salt and water retention, hypertension and bone deminerali-zation. If on prolonged treatment with corticosteroids, the child should be monitored for steroid toxicity. Examination for cushingoid features, monthly record of blood pressure, six-monthly record of height and weight, and yearly evaluation for cataract is recommended.Hopefully this will help you.Take care"},{"Patient":"My 5-year-old female child has been having pain after urinating.

The pain associated with urination is most likely due to urinary tract infection(UTI).  The urine report of your daughter is not suggestive of any specific infection as such. But let me tell you that the sensitivity of urine routine examination for detection of UTI is not good enough.The best investigation to detect is urine culture and sensitivity test. So, I would recommend you to give a properly collected early morning urine sample for culture and start her on Antibiotics accordingly. You may consult your pediatrician for appropriate antibiotic and dose required once you have urine report. Otherwise, you may even send us direct query in which you may attach the repot.Hopefully this will help you.

He wakes up and comes down stairs in a panic and vomits.  I have read online it could be some form of epilepsy.  Any suggestions!","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMI have gone through your question and understand your concern. The symptoms can occur due to gastritis associated with overnight fasting or it may be a form of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.The hallmark characteristics of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy are the presence of myoclonic jerks that occur on awakening from sleep either in the morning or from a nap. They are typically described as shock-like, irregular and arrhythmic movements of both arms. Sometimes these movements are restricted only to the fingers making the patient or individual look clumsy or prone to dropping things. They are precipitated by alcohol intake, stress and sleep deprivation.If you feel that the episodes are associated with above mentioned symptoms, then an electroencephalogram (EEG) will be useful to detect any occult epilepsy.Else, you may start antacids for him to relieve gastric acidity which might be the cause of these episodes of vomiting.Hopefully this will help you.Take care"},{"Patient":"My daughter is 2 Yr 3 Mths old she is suffering from Cough.

Please advice should i continue with these medicins?","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMI have gone through your question and understand  your concerns. But don't worry. Most of the coughs without fever and breathing problems are viral in origin and improve gradually over a period of time. In early infancy there is no need to continue treatment with antibiotics and antihistamine for these symptoms. As such, I would recommend you to just give her comfort care which includes:1. Keep her well hydrated by regular feeds. 2. Use normal saline nasal drops every 3-4 hours with suction at times, if she has blocked nose.3. Keep a room humidifier while sleeping if the weather is dry.As the baby grows, these symptoms gradually subside.Hopefully this will help you.I would be happy to help you out in any questions.Take care"},{"Patient":"My 4month old is having a cold sweat only on her head....she is also teething and having an issue moving her bowels I have gotten her to have an easier time with the bowel move,ends since I started her on prunes...could this all be related or should I be worried","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMI completely understand your concerns but don't worry. In infants the body temperature regulation which occurs by hypothalamus in brain is not mature. So, many infants have a tendency to sweat excessively especially over head and neck. This improves gradually with age and do not need any specific therapy.The bowel movements can also vary greatly in frequency, consistency and colour every few days in the same infant. If the child is comfortable, feeding well and growth is good then nothing needs to be done. Only thing is regular feeds. If you are giving formula feeds instead of breastfeeding, then check for proper hygiene and dilution. Many a times, dehydration can be the reason for constipation in infants.It's not advisable to introduce complementary feeds before 6 months of age. So wait for now on any introduction of feeds.Hopefully this will help you.I will be glad to answer any further questions.Take care"},{"Patient":"a eighteen months kid suffering from the loss motions since 3 days on words.for that purpose MBBS , DCH  doctor has given treatment likeoflamaxin , oral suspention , eritthromicion medicins are given for the chid.but till now kid has not covered fro the loss motions.  then what i will do?","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMI have gone through your question and understand your concerns.

Oral rehydration therapy with ORS, lemonade, buttermilk and soups is useful to prevent dehydration secondary to diarrhoea.- a zinc supplement such as ZnD or Zinconia for next 2 weeks. Zinc helps in regeneration of damaged mucosa and speedy recovery..- for secretory diarrhoea, Racecadotril granules also help.- Probiotics such as Enterogermina are useful.Hopefully this will help you.I would be happy to help you for any further questions.Take care"},{"Patient":"had too much to drink last night and started having chills during night that lasted off/on into the day today. it has been about 20 hrs now since last drink and still have intermittent chills and nausea . however i just started to get genital burning in the last couple hrs. no pain w/ urinating, no fever . i am wondering if chills are normal w/ hangovers or if uti is possible","Doctor":"Dear sir, chills are not usual signs of hangover.

The tracer is handled by the liver like bile. A special nuclear medicine scanner (gamma camera) tracks the flow of the tracer from the liver into your gallbladder and small intestine.It's good for your baby and the pain associated with the cannulation can be well handled with analgesia in NICU setup.

If the symptoms occur only before school timing and improve at other times, it's more likely due to anxiety he is facing for school. Counselling will be useful in that case. In case the symptoms are persistent at other times of day as well, then we need to think in organic cause of illness such as vitamin deficiencies, gastritis or worm infestations. You may deworm him by Albendazole or nitazoxanide in that case and start him on Lansoprazole before breakfast for a few days in such case.

It seems to be due to viral illness which might have been transmitted by his brother. Don't worry as most viral infections are self limiting and recover within few days. They just need symptomatic treatment.So you may give him acetaminophen in case of fever spikes and repeat at 6-8 hours interval if fever persists.

When I arrive at the hospital they take my blood and I have high white blood cell count. I have had every test possible done and come back all normal. When I have my attack or whatever it is, I usually feel like I have a gas bubble in my stomache that won t go away and it progressively gets worse after a couple hours tell soon I am vomiting from the pain and curled in a ball not able to walk. The only thing that seemed to help while in the hospital was Demerol and buscapen. The one surgeon I have been seeing is saying he will attempt to take out my gallbladder only if I want, because I have a 1 in three chance I will either get better, get worse or stay the same. I seem to always feel nauseas, and I m very gassy, especially burping. My pain when I have my attack is in the middle in my stomache, right below my ribs and goes to around my belly button and then sometimes shoots all over but hurts alot too press more to the right side for me. It is not my appendix though. I am so sick of suffering from this. I seem to constantly be sick. And I also don t like to take Demerol cause it makes me nauseas and feel weird. I sometimes will wake up in the middle of the night gassy, heart burn , and nauseas, and slightly in pain but nothing serious ( like right now for example ) I feel hot and cold . And so uncomfortable. I just want too sleep. I also wonder if its maybe the food I eat. I dont eat terribly but sometimes I eat bad food like chips. I feel hopeless cause many doctors have given up on me considering they can t find anything wrong with me. I know something is wrong for a fact. One doctor even thought it was all in my head, but I m sure it s not. I don t believe my white blood cell count would be high cause things all in my head. I also am not overweight .

I would suggest you to take a full course of antibiotics for helicobacer infection along with antacids to releive you of the gastritis like symptoms and if it doesn't give you any respite, instead of getting the gall bladder removed it would be better to investigate for chronic appendicitis and get it removed. You could also take the small measures of have small frequent low fat and spice diet and going in for some kind of meditation or yoga to calm your mind and to get over the anxiety and tension that you seem to be suffering from due to this condition, It would also be worthwile to get an x-ray KUB done to rule out any uretric stones as they can mimic  an acute appendicitis attack.

This US finding is very unspecific. Gallbladder stones can cause such symptoms, so called biliary colics which are usually associated with nausea and vomiting especially after meal. Also some other disorder such as diskynesia or polyps in gallbladder can cause the same. It is very often diagnosis and you shouldnt be worried at all. If your symptoms persists u should do repeated US tests and when diagnosis is confirmed then the surgical procedure, cholecystectomy needs to be done. Today it is done laparoscopicaly so recovery is fast and complications minimal. If you feel pain under the right rib arch associated with fever and vomiting or you notice jaundice and dark urine you should go to ER as soon as possible.

Had this from earlier prescription from 1 year back. Pls help","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query. Enzoflam is an NSAID pain killer medication, and NSAIDs can cause gastric irritation. Your symptoms appear to be indicative of a gastro-enteritis (probably due to giardiasis or amoebiasis), and hence I feel that taking Enzoflam could probably worsen the gastritis. There are other pain-relieving medication which are more gastric-friendly and would be more appropriate in this situation. Even if you would like to take Enzoflam, it's better to take it along with an anti-ulcer medication like Ranitidine (Zantac) - available over-the-counter. Also, avoid spicy and oily foods and take a bland diet. Drinking plenty of fluids, especially cold milk, can also help alleviate your symptoms.

Wishing you and your baby good health."},{"Patient":"As a baby she vomited a lot after she would drink a bottle but she was growing and gaining weight so her doctor said he thought that it would improve as she got older and her sphincter muscles became stronger. As she got older it did pretty much go away so I thought he was right. Around the age of 13 or 14 she started having episodes where she would vomit constantly for about 7-10 days. She would keep absolutely nothing down but she didn t feel sick..So not like a stomach virus. This occurred frequently so we went through many tests. Upper GI s etc. She tested negative for celiac disease and food allergies and they never found anything. The only thing that ever flagged was her serum amylase would be high. All other pancreatic enzymes were normal. We tried her on a gluten free diet which seemed to help a little ( now I know this helped some because of her eliminating a lot of the products enriched with folic acid) I work in a laboratory so I am fairly familiar with lab normals. She was a majorette and performed in numerous parades from the time she was 5 until about two years ago when she could no longer make it through a parade without nearly passing out. At around the same time she started to become very anxious and emotional. She had a couple panic attacks and started not wanting to go to school. She was unable to explain why because she had no rational reason. My daughter and I are extremely close she is my best friend and I am 100% sure that there was no bullying or arguing with friends or the typical high school girl drama causing any of the issues. She was well liked, a straight A student in honors classes. Her only issue evident to me was she was too hard on herself and pushed herself too hard. Even as a freshman she was stressing over getting into an ivy league college so I know her college choices etc stressed her some, but that was it. She spent the last half of her senior year on homebound because of her illness.I took her to another doctor, a counselor and a psychiatrist to try to figure out what was going on. The psychiatrist spent a whole 15 minutes talking with her ( all of which i was present for) and basically asked her which anti depressant she wanted to try. I asked him if we could at least do some blood work before we rushed into that. So he agreed basically just to appease me. This time her amylase was still elevated and also her folic acid level. Two different doctors told me that was fine.,but being her mother and knowing that she did not take any supplements and that her diet was that of a typical 18 yr old I still found it unusual so I did my research and discovered the MTHFR mutation. I requested that another doctor order the test for the MTHFR mutation she disagreed with me and insisted she have a HIDA scan because she was sure it was her gall bladder. I agreed to the testing, but insisted she still order the MTHFR mutation test. She did. It was no big surprise when the MTHFR came back positive and the HIDA scan was completely normal. She on the other hand said that it was fine because it was heterozygous. I immediately started her on methyl b12 and eliminated products enriched with folic acid from her diet. The vomiting for weeks was apparently due to her body detoxing itself ( if what I read was correct not only does the folic acid build up but it could also cause build up or deficiencies of other things like copper, iron etc. ) So with the methyl b12 and diet change the anxiety went away, the vomiting stopped, she graduated with high honors from high school. Received a full scholarship to college and is now in her second semester. Sounds like a happy ending right? Well here s where it gets tricky. Her mood swings are starting back, she is extremely emotional and stresses constantly. I know she cheats occasionally on her diet, but not alot. It is hard to find things she can eat that she actually wants to eat in a college cafeteria. So she is basically attempting to prepare her own meals in between her classes. She is pre pharmacy so it s a heavy load. Now she is once again vomiting every time she eats. This happens even when she is not eating any folic acid. We are on at 4 weeks now and no signs of it stopping.","Doctor":"Hi dear,I understand your concern,she should get examined for uric acid, liver tests,B12, folic acid,stool culture, stool for cyst and ova, ultrasound of abdomen.

May i know the cause of the same and how to reduce this. The doctors are prescribing K-Bind Powder in this situation and what should be immediate treatment for this","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMI can understand your concerns. High potassium levels are to be treated as soon as possible because they can cause some serious problems with electrical conductivity of the heart. The causes can be many depending upon the clinical situation. It may be due to transcellular shifts from cells to plasma like in acidosis, increased intakes or poor excretion by impaired renal functions. The treatment needs a keen monitoring of levels and corrections such as sodium bicarbonate, calcium infusions, potassium binding agents. Also the underlying cause needs to be addressed.It needs a proper ICU monitoring and intensivist care. Hopefully this will help you.Take care"},{"Patient":"My 8 month old has vomited twice this eve, after dinner & all his bottle. He was very snuggly & clingy & a bit floppy before bed. Should I worry? how do I tell if he s hungry or just upset in the night? And if I give him milk how can I help him not vomit again? Any advice appreciated.","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMI understand your concerns but don't worry. Infants in this age group are prone to mild self limiting viral gastroenteritis episodes. This is due to their tendency to bite on everything in their reach.Usually these episodes do not last for more than a week. Only things that you need to take care of are:1. Proper hydration by regularly offering him feeds and oral fluids. Do not give excess sweetened juices as they may precipitate osmotic diarrhoea.2. Start a zinc supplement such as ZnD or Zinconia for next 2 weeks. This will help in improving his immunity to such infections and early recovery.3. Maintain a good hygiene in his surroundings to prevent such episodes.Hopefully this will help you to take necessary measures. I would be happy to help you for any further questions.Take care"},{"Patient":"my 6 yr old daughter has had a cough for 3 weeks. she has now started gasping for air about 1 hour after going to bed and usually ends up vomiting. this only happens one time but is now occurring every night. episode lasts for a few minutes. our pediatrician evaluated her last Friday and said her lungs and chest sound clear. she started her on Claritin which has not helped and we started her on Zithromax 2 days ago. I will be calling our pediatrician tomorrow. any ideas?","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMI have gone through your question and understand your concerns. I see such cases routinely in my clinical practice. Most common reason for such cases is an allergic tendency of child leading to cough, nasal congestion and enlarged adenoids leading to breathing problems especially in lying position.I usually recommend the following measures to help such cases:1. If possible, avoid allergens responsible for the episode. It can be airborne, insects, soaps and detergents or food products. 2. Start her on Syp. Benadryl or Chlorpheniramine for antihistamine effect. It will also help her sleep peacefully.3. For nasal congestion, you may use Azelastine spray which has local antihistamine effect. It helps to relieve nasal congestion and post nasal drip.4. Use a room humidifier while sleeping if the weather is dry.5. Continue with Zithromax as many a times atypical bacterial infections lead to such episodes.In case the problem continue, take an ENT specialist opinion.Hopefully this will help you.

They don t know what s caused this whether it could be an inflammation or an infection. He is in NICU","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCM I have gone through your question and understand your concerns. As per your description, your grandchild's white cell count were definitely low at birth. Most common reason for this is early onset sepsis. But it should ideally also be supported by C reactive protein, blood culture and sensitivity. The neonate so usually respond well to a course of antibiotics as per the sensitivity pattern of the suspected bacteria.The good point is that the count of 10.5 is perfectly fine and acceptable.

Diagnosis can be confirmed by asking question:\\"Did you wash hands before meal?\\". Try giving ORS, Charcoal 2 tablets for absorption of toxins. It also might help to avoid eating or drinking tea for two hours. To help control the stomach acid, one should takes rice soup,boiled mashed potato;avoid to eat chocolate or spicy or greasy foods.In this case headache can be symptom of intoxication.The second possibility is of dehydration as it may lead to increasing leel of uric acid in the blood  which is worse when child don't drink water. Pancreatic enzymes like serum amylase and lipase,liver test,stool culture should be measured to rule out any pancreatic cause. The last possibility is of heat wave which may cause hypotonia. For this purpose you need to check BP. I suggest you to consult a paediatrician and keep her hydrated with plenty of water.

Nephritic colic/ kidney stones/ pyelonephritis etc ( urinalysis+ kidney ultrasound) 3. Diverticulitis 4. Ectopic pregnancy ( pregnancy test +, pelvic ultrasound may or may not show) 5. Colic 6.

Most of the throat infections with fever are caused by viruses which actually do not need any antibiotics at all. These are mostly self limiting illnesses in children and get improved with just symptomatic treatment over a period of 1 week.Sometimes, if they are associated with congestion of throat, enlarged lymph nodes, high grade fever, enlarged and inflamed tonsils, the bacterial infections are the cause. Streptococcus is the most common reason. It needs to be confirmed by a pediatrician, throat swab culture and a complete course of penicillins or other sensitive antibiotics. I usually recommend single injection of Benzathine penicillin, or 10 days penicillin v oral or 5 day course of Azithromycin. Hopefully this will be helpful.

If the stomach pain is central and not associated with any other symptoms such as fever, jaundice, vomiting, bowel or bladder dysfunction, then it is not likely to be benign.

Along with this give healthy diet with lots of fluids especially water. Avoid spicy and oily food for the time being including fast foods.Hopefully this will help.In case the pain is associated with any of the above mentioned symptoms, then a proper clinical examination by pediatrician will help.For any further questions, you may contact me.Take care"},{"Patient":"hello i have a 4 year old and he was running a fever yesterday, i took him to the hospital, his fever was at 102.5 when i got him there, mind you the only thing he did was sleep and drink, he would not eat anything but a little bit of eggs, the doctors at the hospital say he had a summer virus, and to give him fever reducer med. they gave him motrin at the hospital and he broke his fever, this morning he woke up running a fever again and it was at 101 this time so i gave him some fever reducer med. that seem not to help so i went and got him some motrin and made him drink gatorade. he broke his fever and around 6pm he spiked a fever again and again it was 101.5. i was wondering if i should go get a second opinion or just wait it out since i gave him more motrin","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCM I have gone through your question and understand your concerns. But don't worry. Most common cause of fever in this age group is self limiting viral infections. They usually last for less than a week. There is no use of going for blood or other investigations so early unless and until the fever is associated with any other symptoms or finding.At present, I would recommend you to give him Syp. Paracetamol for fever spikes at 15-20 mg/kg ( max. 500 mg) and repeat the dose at 6-8 hours interval if fever persists or recurs. It's better than Motrin for fever relief.Also, keep him well hydrated by regular feeds and fluids.Hopefully this will be helpful.

A key feature of this syndrome is the complete absence of the part of the brain located between the two cerebellar hemispheres.Other brain malformations have been reported in people with Dandy-Walker syndrome. These malformations include a failure of the brain to divide properly into the right and left hemispheres (holoprosencephaly), underdeveloped or absent tissue connecting the left and right halves of the brain (agenesis of the corpus callosum), a sac-like protrusion of the brain through an opening at the back of the skull (occipital encephalocele), abnormal slits or clefts in the brain (schizencephaly), or a type of birth defect that occurs when the protective covering around the brain or spinal cord fails to close during development (neural tube defect). These additional brain malformations are associated with more severe signs and symptoms.I think I have not bored with medical jargon. In your case it could be protrusion from meninges under increased CSF pressure and only detailed test with Ct/ MRI and clinical examination can help/ Please consult your doctor for guidance.

Is it possible he is diabetic? we have a neuro concult on Aug. 9th just wondering if i should bring this up as one of my concerns>","Doctor":"The most common cause of bad breath is poor oral hygiene.Bacteria that build up on a person's teeth, tongue and gums can cause plaque (the soft, white deposit that forms on the teeth's surface), gum disease and tooth decay.Eating strongly flavoured foods – such as garlic, onions and spices – is likely to make your breath smell.Some types of medication can also cause bad breath. Is he on any medicines ? Dry mouth, also known as xerostomia, affects the flow of saliva. A lack of saliva can cause bacteria to build up in the mouth, leading to bad breath.In some cases, gastrointestinal conditions may cause bad breath. For example, H. pylori infections (bacterial infections of the stomach lining and small intestine) and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) have been linked with bad breath. I have briefed the few conditions causing bad breath. TO your doubt if he is diabetic, I would ask if there is any family history of diabetes and of course check his FBS, 2 Hr PPBS and HbA1C and decide. Intense thirst,appetite and frequent urination can make one think of diabetes.For seizure as you said, an EEG will be useful and your doctor will ask . Please get back to me with more doubts.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hello Sir, I am Manoj, I had treated for flurel effusion for 6 month, Refocox-H.

Doctor refered me to the tubroclossis expert doctor and he tolds me to make montox test and it gets possitive and He gave me the treatment of DOTS for 6 months. but my abdo. prb is still nor resolved. Please Helps me out sir..","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to HCM, After going through your history it is clear that you have Pleural Effusion that is a kind of fluid in pleural cavity around lungs,you have not mentioned which side is involved.But why this has not resolved in 6 months? This most commonly is due to irregular treatment as stopping drugs in between makes treatment difficult. Now you are taking DOT therapy please continue it regularly and if fluid is more in cavity it can be aspirated and send for AFB,and R&M study. Your abdominal problem may be related to TB itself or drug induced kindly check your liver functions as some time Antitubercular drugs may cause hepatitis. If liver function are OK, taking drug on empty stomach and symptomatic drugs prescribed by your chest physician will help to resolve or at least reduce them.

This word CM is not a widely used abbreviation to my knowledge. May be he meant Congenital Malformation like Hemangioma which is a group of small blood vessels clumped together as a birth mark. It could sometimes enlarge and definitely have blood in the blood vessels as you say. If injured it could bleed profusely. Other bumps that can occur are congenital neurofibromas which will be soft somewhat solid or rubbery in feel.I suggest you to discuss with your doctor. If anyone comes to me I  would explain the nature of his condition. Regards."},{"Patient":"I have an almost 1 year old girl, yesterday evening she put something into her mouth.

An X Ray would reveal if it is radiopaque material like nal.If it is something that does not show up in X Ray then it would be difficult to make out, then a fiber optic endoscopy may show if it is still lodged in stomach. If it has moved down the intestine usually it will pass of in stools which you can closely observe. The danger is only if it is sharp thing that pierces the intestine inits passage.

In this case of CMPI you can give Nutramigen but from a sup with spoon > lack of proper burping the baby after feeds also worsen vomiting.

Treatments include medication, physical devices, , physical therapy, stretching exercises, and surgery. In most people, torticollis resolves in several days to a few weeks. A few people will develop continuing neck problems for months to years. Persistent neck muscle spasms may require referral to a neurologist or surgeon.

They will regain the appetite in another 1-2 weeks. If the kid is otherwise active you need not worry.I take this opportunity to tell you certain scientific facts and relieve your distress - 1. An active is a well kid even if she/ he is not eating well. 2. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone.3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day.4. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.5.

I suggested a fecal matter transplant or Fecal bacteriotherapy because it might solve the problem. i just dont know what to do or what this is and neither does he, he cant work its basically taken his life away and even if its horrible he still wants to know what it is. thank you","Doctor":"Hello, Raven561, Sarcoidosis is really not an autoimmune disease. The disease is more common inAfrican American females more than males.This could result from an an immune resposnse to an infection, high sensitivity to environmental factors or genetic factors. A person with a close relative who has sarcoidosis is nearly five times likely to develop the condition. There is no direct relationship with Crohn's disease. But , sarcoidosis can cause small ulcers in in the colon or any where in the digestive tract. Chest pain, cough,shortness of breath,fatigue,fever,joint pains. weight loss,hair loss, skin lesions called \\"Erythema Nodosum\\" Eye symptoms,dry mouth,etc. are may all be seen. Crohn's is not one of those that is closely associated with this. Fecal bacteriotherapy is being considered as possible treatment for Crohn's , but this is too soon to tell if that is the answer. If the diagnosis is Crohn's after endoscopy and biopsy, then he needs treatment. Now a days there are very effective biologic drugs ti treat Crohn's and you should discuss this with your doctor.

I can feel it all the way up my throat . When it flutters it feels like it is hard to take a breath. I am 32 male. I have Gastritis and Doudenitis. Had a hida scan with a 61% ejection fraction . I am burping alot. Ate homemade pizza then a banana then it started. Went to the ER and sent me home still with the problem. It is worse laying flat.","Doctor":"Hello, kibbeylester, You state that you have been diagnosed with gastritis and duodenitis. I am assuming this was after you had endoscopy and biopsy. Hope you were also tested for H.Pylori which is very common with the above conditions. The biopsy would show this and also there is a breath test to diagnose this. I am also assuming that you were precribed a PPI of some sort (Proton Pump Inhibitor) like Omeprazole, Lansoprazole, Rabeprazole or Esomeprazole etc. Getting GERD symptoms after eating Pizza is almost like test for reflux ! Cheese contains calcium and it can stimulate more acid production. Tomato sauce (Tomato products), caffeine in coffee and tea, alcohol, citrus drinks and fruits all add to acid stimulation. I am sure you probably have some inflammation of the lower esophagus at the junction of the stomach. Laying flat makes it easy for the acid to travel back up into your esophagus because of the weak sphincter muscle. If you do take the PPI, make sure you take it about an hour before you eat ,twice a day for 4-6 weeks or even longer if needed till you are symptom free. I wish you well."},{"Patient":"I noticed my 29 month old son leg shaking when lying down on bed at nite, he later complained that it's painful.it happened once before that he was woken up by the pain in his led in the mid of nite.he's a healthy and active boy.

All milestones are delayed Had milk allergy and now we started to give him milk from last year.","Doctor":"Hi, If I were your treating Doctor for this case of severe pain under the left rib cage, I would come up with three possibilities, these include: The first possibility is of tongue or cheek bite during vomiting. Diagnosis can be confirmed by examination of mouth. To help control the vomiting, you should always keep head of child,give him water to rince outh. Also take some domperidone or ondansetron syrup ; if the symptoms are severe, then you may need drugs like proton pump inhibitors. The second possibility is of febrile seizures. In this case he should be observed by neurologist to rule out seizure cause. The last possibility is of erosive gastritis. For this purpose you need to get an occult blood stool test,stool culture for flora and sensitivity to antibiotics.Hope this answers your question.

Thank you very much...","Doctor":"From your history I feel there could be gastric erosion ( ulceration) in her stomach as there is pain on eating.THis is a rare possibility in 5 year old. Mesenteric lymphadenitis is a possibility.Definitive diagnosis is made by identifying the underlying cause of the gastric mucosal inflammation and/or by tissue (gastric) biopsy. For example, the major infective cause of gastritis is Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). This bacterium can be detected by breath, blood, stool, immunological and biopsy tests.Biopsy of the stomach mucosa, done during endoscopy examinations, is often used in patients to identify the causes of chronic gastritis and may allow visualization of mucosal erosions and other stomach mucosal changes. Abdominal X-rays or barium studies (upper or lower) may demonstrate the presence of thickened mucosa and folds that are signs of inflammation in the stomach.Your doctor can help determine which tests should be done, including ancillary tests that may help identify other causes of the non-specific symptoms commonly found with gastritis. I would give Rantac syrup and watch.For nausea and vomiting another medicine like ondansetron could be give. In your case diagnosis by endoscopy and ultrasound and Xray would help. You can discuss with your doctor. Regards"},{"Patient":"my 4 year old son had an appendectomy 4 days ago. He is eating well, drinking well, has had his first bowel movement a couple of hours ago.

FOr relieving gas as you asked, I would give a carminative syrup marketed as Carmicide-P and see.The description that the distension went away after bowel movement points to gaseous distension.

Every time you need to have the ovulation your egg cell can be held in ovaries and form this kind of cyst.

She was discharged after the treatment and then after few weeks she had fever again for which doctor gave IMOL and fever was gone, at this moment I went for urine normal test twice and in one report there was slight symptom of infection and the other report was clear so doctor ignored the report with the one showing symptom of infection. Now again two week back she had high fever for which doctor prescribed IMOL, the fever would not come for the duration when IMOL was effective but after every 5-6 hours fever would come back again and I have to give her IMOL again, after one week of oral medication I myself went for urine and blood report and found that the infection was there, the TLC count was soaring high around 25000, the doctor told me that she has UTI again, now she was again fed with the IV amikacin injection again. After the course of 7 days was over she was declared fit, but now when I again went for the blood report and urine normal and routine report symptom are still there.

Give her some control over little things3. Keep off-limits objects out of sight and out of reach4. Distract your child5. Help kid learn new skills and succeed6.

My opinion is that you should not worry so much about it now unless the diagnosis is confirmed. We should differentiate next statements:- primary hyperparathyroidism(check parathormon);- manifestation of vitamin D intoxication(check level of Vitamin D);- Williams syndrome, tubulopathy (consult genetics); - leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, neuroblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma(consult haematologist, oncologist);- after chronic ingestion of vitamin A;-Hypophosphatasia, a metabolic bone disease characterized by bone and teeth hypomineralization due to defective function of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP), is also associated with hypercalcemia.- Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia - an autosomal dominant disorder  You should avoid severe hypercalcemia,it can affect the nervous system and cause weakness, hypotonia with proximal myopathy, lethargy and stupor, and rarely seizures. Hypercalcemia can also induce polyuria and dehydration, diabetes insipidus, nephrocalcinosis . I would suggest you:- reduced calcium diet(avoid milk products, cheese and etc.);- continue pamidronate,it is inhibitor of bone resorption;- consume food enriched with Potassium, because it is Calcium antagonist(apricot, raisins,banana,potato and etc.)If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer.

Is this being caused by her hormones and what can I do about it?","Doctor":"Dr. Hanif warmly Welcomes you!Thanks for consulting at my virtual clinic. I have carefully worked through your case, and I can realize your health worries. Being your physician, I assure you not to worry as I will take care all of your medical concerns. This is all due to age related changes and yes emotional variance caused primarily by the female sex hormones. This is the very high time, she needs her parents' help more than ever before. Never let her feel alone and down. Be the best ever friend of her. She needs a comoanion and some ways to show the emotional imbalance to. Become a reservoir for her every emotional and psychological behavior.After a year or two, she will become attached to you and will become dependant only on you.If you will not do what I said, she may go astray. She needs someone, I am damn sure. If not you, someone from outside home. Who can be that? Anyone, who wins her heart and anyone may get advantage of her emotionally imbalanced personality. I am sure you understand what I say. I recommend you to read a book by Laura E. Burk named \\"Child Development\\". Its seventh edition is the best one.

Thanks in advance for replying.","Doctor":"Dear madam, my opinion is that these symptoms are more likely associated with your previous surgical procedure then with your diet. You should definitely check your pelvic organs. this means you should do pelvic ultrasound or CT scan to see if there is some collection or abscesses formation or adhesions in area of removed fallopian tube. Adhesions could cause intestinal obstruction and symptoms u re describing. Pulsating pain could mean that vessels are involved but Ultrasound should detect this too. Many other disorders can be considered such as diverticulitis, crohn disease or ovary cyst so i advice first to do tests i ve mentioned.

I would like to know if the symptoms are just confined to his thigh folds or does it extend into his scrotal skin also. Is there any itching and is his scrotum normal or swollen.

Vitamin D3 may lead to toxicity only when given high doses for many days. It's usually rare at the dose you gave to your child.The main consequence of vitamin D toxicity is a buildup of calcium in your blood (hypercalcemia), which can cause poor appetite, nausea and vomiting. Weakness, frequent urination and kidney problems also may occur.At present, just hold on the vitamin D3 drops for next 10 days and restart it there after.Everything will be fine.

It can be due to liver dysfunction or gut infections. I see such cases in my clinical practice and recommend them for the following measures:1. Proper stool examination- routine, microscopy and ova/cyst detection.2. A complete blood count with peripheral smear and liver function test to check for associated jaundine.3. In case of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, an ultrasound abdomen might be helpful.4. Keep the child well hydrated during these episodes by oral rehydration therapy such as lemonade, soups, buttermilk etc.Further plan of treatment is decided based on the reports and definitive diagnosis.Hopefully this will help you.

Pls check your temperature and pulse. In addition get the undermentioned common baseline investigations done at the earliest., (1)Stools for routine and Microscopy(2) Urinalysis-complete(3) Blood Counts including Hb%,TC,DC,ESR. (4)USG Abdomen(to rule out cholelithiasis as well if pain is in epigastrium) and Pelvis. As you have not been clinically examined., only Differential Diagnosis can be given at this stage., A) Dyspepsia;-Due to consumption of Non Fibre containing sticky and soft diet ,enzymatic digestion getting delayed with distension and gas formation. The distension leads to stimulation of stretch receptors leading to pain in and around umbilicus. B) Worm Colic;-Stool Tests will confirm whether it is due to Worms in intestines. Usually passage of small worms/eggs confirm the diagnosis. C)Urolithiasis;-Demonstration of Oxalaturia /RBCs in Urine/ USG confirmation will ascertain the Diagnosis. D)Spasmodic Dysmenorhoea;-During menses in unmarried girls Uterine congestion leads to Spasmodic Dismenorrhoea. USG Pelvis will reveal the exact reason. E)Intense Pain around umbilicus with Vomitting and tenderness in Mc Burney's Point in lower right quadrant of abdomen with raised total WBC count indicates Acute Appendicitis.

It is possible that acid reflux, called GERD in which gastric acid regurgitates into esophagus is the cause of cough relieved with vomiting Unless there is no fever and cough with sounds of mucus / phlegm.

Watery diarrhoea in children are usually seen in viral diarrhoea and generally subsides. in 2-3 days. But lasting for 20 days points to some infection.

In that case stop bottle and feed only breast milk and other feeds, if you must from cup with spoon . I  have seen this working in my clinic and I strongly dissuade bottle feed and would advise a probiotic powder and a racecadotril powder available in sachets like Zedott, Enuff or Racedot.

New mothers feeling breast milk is not sufficient is usually from lack of knowledge. If the baby cries always it is not for milk,but a wet napkin or gas not burped well, all cause babies cry. If there is weight gain 30- 50 grams per day there's  enough milk. THis implies the need for well baby checkup monthly. THe complains of not passing motion is the result of giving Naan that too with a bottle, I presume. I suggest you give only breast milk and if you must give formula give it after breast feed and with spoon from cup and stop bottle forthwith. When giving formula you must give small amounts of boiled water with spoon in between where as additional water is not needed in breast fed child. Also do neonatal thyroid screening by doing TSH test.Please follow my advice and get back to me.

I am happy to address your questions, this medication is used to treat sudden diarrhea. It works by slowing down the movement of the gut. This decreases the number of bowel movements and makes the stool less watery. It is also used to treat on-going diarrhea with inflammatory bowel disease. It treats only the symptoms, not the cause of the diarrhea (e.g., infection). Treatment of other symptoms and the cause of the diarrhea should be determined by your doctor. It is preferred not use in children younger than 6 years unless directed by your doctor. This medication should not be used in infants younger than 24 months - your boy is 8 months). Common side effects are abdominal pain; distention or discomfort; constipation; nausea; vomiting; dry mouth. You observe if there is stasis ie,slowing of bowel movement and associated gastric distension or vomiting. If none is there no aggressive steps be taken. Hope I have answered your query.

He faced the problem since 10 days. He reduced almost 2.5 kgs in this illness. what is the symptoms is this, what is the permanent remedies for this.","Doctor":"With regard to your concern I would like to tell that the normal color of the human tongue is pink to red. In some people the tongue tends to be more red than in others but this is not necessarily a discoloration of the tongue.Glossitis is inflammation of the tongue that may arise for any number of reasons. The process of inflammation increases blood flow to the tongue and leads to redness, pain and swelling. The more common causes of glossitis are acute mechanical or chemical injury or infections.Vitamin deficiencies as is seen with vitamin B12, niacin or folic acid may cause a strawberry red tongue.Scarlet fever (scarlatina) is a condition that may sometimes develop in a person with streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat). It presents with a red rash that covers most of the body along with a strawberry red tongue. Scarlet fever arises as a reaction to the toxin from the streptococci (bacteria) that causes the infection.  For these cough have you not given any medicine or showed any doctor ? If you are giving medicine the colour may be due to that also.I would check his blood for CBC and related tests,if you have not done so far.

Does this sound like a d&v bug? S something else? No temperature and is just a little grizzly and cries out every now and then like he is in discomfort.","Doctor":"Hi....it could be cow's milk protein allergy. I went through the history points you have provided - I was expecting that there should have been a history of cow's milk and formula feed (this too contains cow's milk protein) given to the baby.I feel that your baby is having cow's milk protein allergy. Unusually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds. 3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4. If you feel your feeds alone are inadequate for the baby, then Zerolac is the only option till 6 months age. I request you to keep me posted about the recovery of the baby and follow up of the case.Regards – Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My nine month old son has severe colic issues.

Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely.

Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridges & soups.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

Your stomach ache could be related to that.You need to use stool softeners and a local anaesthitic jelly for complete evacuation of your bowels. Due to the pain you are not able to do so and that in turn is causing constipation and hard stools. You need to take something to soften your stools and evacuate it regularly for a week to 10 days an also llignocaine jelly for local application at the anal fissure to let it heal. After that you need to have food with hight fiber like green leafy veg.and fruits regularly. You also need to shift from refined food products to wholesome grains.

Your help is surely appreciated. Thank You Very Much.","Doctor":"I understand your concern.Some people turn to a substance called human growth hormone (HGH) in hopes that it will keep them feeling and looking youthful. But experts say that hope is unfounded. And worse, these products can be harmful.HGH, produced by the pituitary gland, spurs growth in children and adolescents. It also helps to regulate body composition, body fluids, muscle and bone growth, sugar and fat metabolism, and possibly heart function. Produced synthetically, HGH is the active ingredient in a number of prescription drugs and in other products available widely over the Internet. HGH products -- or products that claim to increase your body's own production of HGH -- in the form of pills and sprays. Companies that market these products on TV infomercials or online claim they turn back your body's biological clock, reducing fat, building muscle, restoring hair growth and color, strengthening the immune system, normalizing blood sugar, increasing energy and improving sex life, sleep quality, vision, and memory.However, there is  no reliable evidence to support the claim that these products have the same effects as prescription HGH, which is always given by injection. Taken orally, HGH is digested by the stomach before it can be absorbed into the body..  i hope this fact that the HGH orally given can produce no possible changes. alleviates your worry. You are free to clarify any more doubts with description of any side effects or effects you think are from this oral capsule."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, my 2 years old son is having Gillberts syndom and he is due for Hepatitis A vaccine as we are travelling soon to endemic area so is there any relation between this vaccine or any other vaccination to be contraindicated in his case ?

The pea sized lump as you said could be a lymph node in the inguinal area enlarged. The cause is usually an infection in the drainage area like foot or anywhere below the gland.Infections could be a folliculitis or a pustule or simply a small abrasion that occurs while playing. In such cases I would look for the focus of infection and treat with an antibiotic cream. As there is pain I would give antiinflammatory analgesic like Brufen syrup and observe Once the infection is treated the lump will also go away in some time. Take care and inform me if any more doubts. Observe if the swelling increases while crying or coughing in which case it could be an inguinal hernia. If you have more worries please clarify with your doctor and have him  examined."},{"Patient":"Thanks. I am 41 yr old female with no problems and not overweight and no disease.

Some of the leading causes of bacterial meningitis  are  Haemophilus influenzae (most often caused by type b, Hib), Streptococcus pneumoniae, group B Streptococcus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Neisseria meningitidis.Infants are at higher risk for bacterial meningitis than people in other age groups. However, people of any age are at risk.which pathogens more commonly affect which age groups can be made out by an experienced doctor.If meningitis is suspected, samples of blood or cerebrospinal fluid (near the spinal cord) are collected and sent to the laboratory for testing. It is important to know the specific cause of meningitis because that helps doctors understand how to treat the disease, and possibly how bad it will get. In the case of bacterial meningitis, antibiotics can help prevent severe illness and reduce the spread of infection from person to person (depending on which bacteria are causing the infection).If bacteria are present, they can often be grown (cultured). Growing the bacteria in the laboratory is important for confirming the presence of bacteria, identifying the specific type of bacteria that is causing the infection, and deciding which antibiotic will work best. Other tests can sometimes find and identify the bacteria if the cultures do not.Bacterial meningitis can be treated effectively with antibiotics. It is important that treatment be started as soon as possible. Appropriate antibiotic treatment of the most common types of bacterial meningitis should reduce the risk of dying from meningitis to below 15%, although the risk remains higher among young infants and the elderly.As your child is under treatment, your doctor would have done all these tests and antibiotics are being given.To give any further opinion, the reports have to be seen. YOu can discuss all details with your doctor and if any special treatment is needed he should tell you.

The majority of HFMD infections are self-limited, so no treatment is required.Clinically, blisters that are painful usually on the hands, feet, and mouth in a child with fever are considered diagnostic of coxsackie virus infection. However, in rare instances, viral tests can be done to identify the virus, but the tests are expensive, usually need to be sent to a specialized viral diagnostic laboratory.

This is inaccurate. Many more viruses cause sore throats than streptococcal bacteria. Fever & sore throat for more than 2 days without cold symptoms suggests possible strep. A culture is best diagnostic test.Hives (also called urticaria) are a common skin reaction in children, characterized by a raised, flat pink rash called wheals. The shape of these bumps can vary, and their size can range from about one-half inch to several inches in diameter. The larger wheals often have pale centers.In most cases, hives are caused by allergies. Foods like shellfish, milk, peanuts, or chocolate can trigger them. So can insect bites or drugs like penicillin. In winter some children develop hives when they are exposed to cold air. Occasionally, children with a strep throat will have hives.

When my daughter was pregnant, little Avery had every blood tests and a million ultra sounds. They were all normal. She also had an MRI. Normal. These were obviously done in utero. Would the deposits have shown up then? I realize this is something you probably have to see to have an answer, but is there a great chance that she will develop the horrendous symptoms I just read?

But how and to what extent it will all unfold is difficult to define.I would also add that children do have a great potential to recover.So we will have to wait.Second,It is not always possible to detect all functional abnormality in brain and other organs because the fetus is developing during  pregnancy.Third , calcified cerebellum.Really, it can occur when we have such problem.But again it does not defines to what extent it could be pathological in giving symptoms.Finally,we do not have the clear diagnosis until now we are just assuming consequences what will happen.It might be due to hypoxic injury or any other forms of congenital developmental anomaly.So it is better to visit a pediatrician first and also seek opinion from pediatric neurologist.

My sister just had a new born baby and they are in the hospital now for four days, your new born baby has an irregular heart beat, I will like to know what cause this to happen and how it can be corrected? ( This is St.Vincent and the Grenadines).Thank you","Doctor":"The heart’s regular rhythm or beat is maintained by a small electrical circuit that runs through nerves in the walls of the heart. When the circuit is working properly, the heartbeat is quite regular; but when there’s a problem in the circuit, an irregular heartbeat, or arrhythmia, can occur. Some children are born with abnormalities in this heart circuitry, but arrhythmias also can be caused by infections or chemical imbalances in the blood. Even in healthy children, there can be other variations in the rhythm of the heartbeat, including changes that occur just as a result of breathing. Such a fluctuation is called sinus arrhythmia, and requires no special evaluation or treatment because it is normal. If your paediatrician says that your child has a true arrhythmia, it could mean that her heart beats faster than normal (tachycardia), very fast (flutter), fast and with no regularity (fibrillation), slower than normal (bradycardia), or that it has isolated early beats (premature beats). While true arrhythmias are not very common, when they do occur they can be serious. On rare occasions they can cause fainting or even heart failure. Fortunately, they can be treated successfully so it’s important to detect arrhythmias as early as possible."},{"Patient":"For about a 3 days I have been Experiencing an unconfortable pain.

I would advise you to rush to the ER as soon as possible;especially since you have unbearable pain and you can't cough or move because of the pain.It would be best to rule out perforation peritonitis which is an emergency.

I feel that your baby is having cow's milk protein allergy. Unusually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds.  3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4. If you feel your feeds alone are inadequate for the baby, then Zerolac is the only option till 6 months age.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do. Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridges & soups.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

These include moisturizers, corticosteroids(betamethasone) and vitamin D creams, and shampoos made with salicylic acid or coal tar.2.Light therapy (phototherapy) uses ultraviolet  light to treat the psoriasis symptoms. I usually recommend brief daily exposure to the sun,visiting of sea beach, but too much sunlight can make psoriasis worse. In severe cases you can try  laser therapy.3.Oral or injected medications are used to treat severe psoriasis or psoriasis that resists other treatments. They include pills, shots, and medicines given intravenously (Calcium gluconate and others).I suggest you to consult a dermatologist. Psoriasis is not genetic disease.Hope this answers your question.

This is a condition that has lasted since Nov-2011, and doctors can t figure out what the issue is. Multiple CT scans show nothing, with just a few showing inflammation in my intestines. A capsule study showed road rash as the doctor called it in my GI tract. Colonoscopy showed nothing. The pain is very severe and requires powerful painkillers to subdue, but I do not want to rely on these painkillers ( Oxycontin , Percocet , etc.) as I can t get anything done on them. However, when I do think i need them, I can t ask for them for fear as being labeled as a drug seeker...any advice on what I can do?","Doctor":"Hello, the.man.coolness, You say that you have had this condition for over a year now. Other than the severe abdominal pain, if you are also experiencing bouts of diarrhea or constipation, we can think of different conditions. But, I am concerned about the finding of inflammation, patchy in nature in your intestines, probably in your small bowel. Your colonoscopy was negative according to you. One condition that would show these types of changes is \\"Crohn's Disease \\". This is more common between the ages of teens to the thirtty plus, although can occur at any age. Depending on the extent of small bowel involvement, the symptoms can vary. Diarrhea, weight loss due to malabsorption, vitamin and mineral deficiencies can be present. Anemia, joint pains, skin and eye problems also are associated with this. If you have a family history of Crohn's or ulcerative colitis, your risk is greater to have this. You did not mention any x-ray studies , like upper GI and small bowel x-rays (Not CT-Scan). How about all your blood tests ? Stool studies ? We need more information. If the pain is severe enough that you need strong pain killers, I think you need additional work up. Hope to hear from you with more information. Wish you well."},{"Patient":"My son 13 year old son has been diagnosed with a chiari 1 malformation.

I would appreciate your opinion","Doctor":"Hi, If I were your treating Doctor for this case, I would come up with three surgical possibilities for relief pressure on the brain and spinal cord, these include:1.Posterior fossa decompression surgery. This involves the removal of a small portion of the bottom of the skull and sometimes part of the spinal column to correct the irregular bony structure. The surgeon also may open and widen the dura matter(hard membrane of brain). That's the firm covering of the brain and spinal cord tissues. This creates additional space for the cerebrospinal fluid to circulate.2.Electrocautery. This uses high-frequency electrical currents to shrink the lower part of the cerebellum.3.Spinal laminectomy. This is the removal of part of the arched, bony roof of the spinal canal. This increases the canal's size and reduces pressure on the spinal cord and nerve roots.Hope this answers your question.

Grabbing the ear may not have any specific reason, but the child may be showing his  boredom ( as you would do nose nose picking or grab your knuckles). However you have to examine his ear cavity by gently pulling down his ear lobe to left,  to open the ear canal and see if there is wax or any debris which can be slowly removed with a soft bud or cotton. As there is no crying associated with grabbing, ear pain is unlikely.After trying this if there is still a cause for concern you can show him to your pediatrician or family doctor.In case of any further doubts please feel free to ask me."},{"Patient":"My 11 month old has had a low grade fever and really red cheeks for a week now.

Gallbladder problems are more common in females, over the age of forty, who are fertile and some of them can be overweight or fatty. That is typical although not everyone fits that description. Also, underactive thyroid is also a little more common to be associated with gallstones. Fatty or fried foods can trigger an attack although it could be spontaneous. The simple way to test is to undergo a sonogram of the upper abdomen to see if you have gallstones. If you do have it, sometimes, you may need to have a nuclear scan at the time you are having symptoms, to see if you have signs of inflammation or Acute Cholecystitis\\".

If he doesnt have symptoms now and no fever then you should just observe him and look for signs such as blood in the stool and urine, weight loss, or sharp abdominal pain with fever. It it happens go to hospital immediately.

Her bloods are showing up clear, although one was slightly, but only slightly they say, for infection which they think could be left over from the appendix op. A small amount of fluid was seen on the ultrasound that shouldn t be there but ultrasound was carried out last Monday and CT last Wednesday. She has had an internal examination and that was extremely painful.","Doctor":"Dear Tina, I dont know the most important thing; how old is you daughter?  Symptoms u re describing can be related to appendectomy complication especially if it was perforated and pelvic type of appendicitis.

Abscessus collection after appendectomy which US is describing could cause such symptoms, and it must be treated by antibiotics. Percutaneous puncture of collection can be also done if neccesary but i suggest just to wait for the effect of antibiotics. If febrility and pain persist then u should repeat CT scan.

I feel that your baby is having cow's milk protein allergy. Unusually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds.  3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4. If you feel your feeds alone are inadequate for the baby, then Zerolac is the only option till 6 months age. I request you to keep me posted about the recovery of the baby and follow of the case.Regards – Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"I am a 56 year old male recently diagonsed with Milld Prostate Enlargement.

Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridges & soups.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

Went back to the doctor said it was the medicine he was on. Two days later, it was worse. Doctor said it was an id reaction. Got better but the mottled color never went away on the back of his legs. Now the rash is coming back. What could this be?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks and welcome to healthcare magic.Ringworm is a fungal infection .Local application of tolnaftate (tini) twice daily for 2-3 weeks will give relief from ringworm .Personal hygiene is also important .Hope this reply is OK for you.Please feel free to ask further queries if any.Dr.M.V.Subrahmanyam."},{"Patient":"Hi , i have a baby girl .8 months age.. ..she has persistent fever .

I ve had this pain for 2 days now and it comes and goes, I also have some tiredness and heartburn . What should I do regarding these symptoms?","Doctor":"dear ileana, abdominal cramps are, unfortunately, an usual symptom during and before the periods.  Cramps are caused by prostaglandins which cause uterus contracion. The contracting muscles help push the blood out through a girl's vagina during her period. So this contractions can be mild or very unpleasant and can vary from month to month. Also other hormonal disbalances due to menstruation cause nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue and abdominal swelling. Girls who are younger when their periods start, who have longer periods or heavier blood flow and smoking are a risk factors for cramps. Heartburn can be related to this story but also it can mean tah you have some kind of gastric problems such as GERD, Ulcer/gastritis so you should do gastroscopy to find the exactly whats going on. Use analgetics( nonsteroid) for pain relief because they decrease prostaglandin production in blood. To be sure that you re healthy do gynaecology examination and pelvic ultrasound to check your uterus and ovaries and steroid hormone levels. Wish you good health, Dr. Ivan Romic (Rominho)"},{"Patient":"my 11 month old baby has a cough and was prescribed sabutamol. she was also given an inhale which is to be sprayed in her face through a styrofoam cup. she still coughs alot after 5 days of medication and brings up a bit of food/tea when coughing.. what do i do?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks and welcome to healthcare magic.Couh since 5 days is really a matter of concern.your history suggests that he may be suffering from spasmodic Cough due to asthma or whooping cough.Sabutamol through inhaler or nebulisation may be continued.You may add steroids either orally or by inhalation .An antibiotic like erythromycin may help in case of whooping cough.Usually it takes a week to 10 days for relief.Hope this reply is OK for you.Please feel free to ask further queries if any.Dr.M.V.Subrahmanyam."},{"Patient":"Sir My son of 2 and half years old is having loose motion for the past one week three to four times a day.
