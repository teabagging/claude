Nausea & vomiting in pregnancy  can be easily controlled with-    - Rest, Eating dry  eatables ( bickuites, dry fruits ) very slowly , before you get up in morning.     - Taking light easily digestible food small servings more frequently.        -taking sips of juices/ coconut water/ soups/ cold milk .   - avoid psychological stress/ have positive mentality.  * medications containing Doxylamine succinate ( doxinate )at bed time help.  * excessive vimiting needs Iv infusion.  * Your past history of gastritis demands avoiding spicy, oily heavy to digest food . take bland food . cold milk is mostly digested well.

Fresh spotting can sometimes be seen during ovulation. Brownish discharge suggests old bleeding and can be due to some breakthrough bleeding.

This is because the successive tests you took were negative. Yet, a clarification can be had through an estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres.

First of all I should request you to stop the smoking because it is going to harm your child, your body as well as your psychological problems like depression and anxiety. You are already stressed. From the given symptoms, you are suffering from pre-natal depression. It can interfere with a woman's ability to care for herself during her pregnancy. You may be less able to follow medical recommendations, as well as sleep and eat properly. The condition can also put you at risk for greater use of tobacco, alcohol, and illegal drugs that can harm you and your developing baby.Evidence suggests that many antidepressant medicines are safe for treating depression during pregnancy, and will not harm your growing baby, at least according to the results from short-term studies. You should discuss the possible risks and benefits of antidepressants with your doctor. If necessary, he or she should also be able to refer you to a mental health specialist. Don't worry. You will be able to face the delivery as scheduled. If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL.  Make sure that you include every minute detail possible.

Results showed normal sperm count, but motility was 40% rapidly progressive, 30% not moving at all, and the remainder were moving but either slow or in the wrong direction. does this mean we won t be able to conceive naturally?","Doctor":"Hi,   I understand your concern.   Yes, motility of sperms does affect conception.  For conception, sperms have to travel all along  uterus to meet mature ovum( on it's way from peritoneal cavity to uterus ) within 32-3 days of it's  release from ovum.So for sperms with less motility can not do it & conception becomes difficult.   But 30% sperms having grade 3 to 4 movements  are sufficient for conception. Your husband seems to have a sufficient motility & should not hamper the task. You can conceive naturally. You can recheck it with his doctor.    Less sperm motility can be corrected by medicines/ surgery ( for Varicocele ) or  IUI/IVF   Thanks."},{"Patient":"I am 38 years old. my LMP is 13/4/10 and my last sonography shows I am 33 weeks pregnant.

Considering your due date as 1 May, the LMP would be around 24 July. You say, it was 25 July, which also fits into this calculation. In that case your date of conception has to be somewhere near 8 August. However, a week to and fro is possible.

If you are overweight, if your waist/hip ratio is more, it is likely that you are having polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Ultrasonography will confirm this diagnosis. Better get your tests done (ovulation  monitoring, study of the uterine lining) to assess whether you release your eggs or not. Also get tests like hysterosalpingography, laparoscopy done to confirm the patency and normalcy of your genital tract. Simultaneous semen examination of your husband is necessary to confirm the normalcy of the sperms. After these preliminary reports only your Gynaecologist will be well equipped to guide you further.

My ribs hurt alot aswell to breathe. Been having alot of trouble sleeping i cant lie on either of my sides or back without it hurting. Also get really bad leg cramps.","Doctor":"Hi,This type of pain,backache, discomfort and leg cramps are likely due to change of posture and having pressure nerves and blood supply at this stage of pregnancy.Change the position frequently while lying down position.Go for normal walking exercises daily.Avoid sedentary life style.Go for deep breathing exercises.Just relax and avoid stress.Ok and take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, i am a 22 year old pregnant female. I received a phone call from my doctor telling me that my RBC count has dropped from a 36 to a 24,,,he wants me to get a stat blood work done to make sure that the lab didnt do the test wrong.... what does this mean for me or my baby?","Doctor":"Hi,   I understand your concern.   Low blood count in pregnancy needs to be treated well to avoid untoward effects on pregnancy,  It consists of-    - Oral iron, folic acid, B12, vitamin C  with high protein diet ( meat, eggs, diary products )    - Injectable Iron ( IM/ IV)may be  needed in case of sever iron deficiency anemia.    - Blood transfusion with cross matched blood of same group is indicated in sever anemia.   * A sudden drop of blood cells means a lot for the pregnancy as well as mother. It  indicates some form of hidden blood loss / lack of blood formation in body. Here treatment of anemia is as important as the control of bleeding is . That is why doctor has ordered for repeat blood count.    Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor i didn t have any sexual intercourse with my partner for years now he had only fingered me that also during my non fertile days i am pretty sure there was no sperm on his finger.

For conception deposition of sperms in vagina in fertile days of a woman is essential There is no chance of conception with fingering/ in infertile days,    Delay in periods can occur due to hormonal disturbances following stress/ illness/ ovarian or thyroid problems/ PCOD.     you should-     - Wait for natural perods for a week more ,OR    - take tablet Regestrone 1 pill twice a day ( 12 hourly ) for  3 days & wait for bleeding after 8 days of withdrawal.

So far it was in latent phase; however with the stress of pregnancy, it became overt. Even if your sugar goes back to normal levels after delivery, the diabetes remains in your body - in latent phase and sometimes in future, it becomes overt. Diabetes is a hereditary metabolic dysfunction which is associated with gene. This gene is recessive gene. Hence even if only one partner is diabetic still there are chances that the baby will be diabetic. There are two types of diabetes - Type I and Type II. It all depends on which type of diabetes the baby is having . According to the type of diabetes, it will become overt at some age, it may require insulin since childhood, etc. Please report to your baby's Paediatrician once to get the baby investigated for the evidence of the Diabetes, if at all she has it. If your husband is non-diabetic, there are good chances that your baby may be non-diabetic since the diabetic gene is a recessive (non-dominant) gene. You need not be under stress. Medical science has advanced quite ahead. Diabetes is not a disease but is a metabolic disorder and hence can be managed chronically with due precautions and treatment.

When do pregnant women stop from having contact (sex?) I also have a history of UTI. Hope you could help me. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,During first three months pregnancy is in a rather precarious phase. Hence, we advise to observe sexual abstinence during first three months of pregnancy. After that, if there is no risk factor, sex can be performed. However, it is safer to perform sex with partial insertion of penis into the vagina. If the sex is performed in side positions, the penis will not be completely inserted. It is safe to have sex like this till 7 months of pregnancy. After seven months, physically it becomes uncomfortable to have sex. There is a risk of pressure on the abdomen also. Moreover, the uterus is becoming more and more sensitive; hence pressure on the abdomen may cause the premature contractions of the uterus or risk to the pregnancy. For your urinary infection, please get your urine examined and then get culture & sensitivity done on your urine. This will identify the bacteria and the antibiotics to whom they are sensitive. Accordingly, you may be given appropriate antibiotics. Moreover, you are having itching in your private parts which started after the intercourse. This means that you have developed either fungal or trichomonal infection from your husband. These infections lead to white discharge and are likely to infect the eyes of the baby during delivery. Therefore, avoid sex till both of you are completely cured of these infections. Both of you must take the treatment simultaneously, shave the private parts, boil underwear and cut the nails short. I would advise you to use panty-liners. These precautions will prevent the reinfection. PLEASE DO NOT HAVE SEX TILL ALL YOUR INFECTIONS ARE CURED.  Please report to the Obstetricians about these infections and get appropriately treated. I hope you have got the message.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor! i have a question for my wife to get the pregnancy 12th july & 14th august is the menses time, 16th september we had a intercourse then menses did not came and after 3 weeks she got vomitting feeling and other symtomps but 16th october she got menses. what was the problem doctor?","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.In my opinion if there is delayed period in case of regular cycles the pregnancy should be ruled out by doing a urine pregnancy test.If the test is positive the bleeding can be considered as miscarriage.If the test is negative the delayed period can be due to hormonal imbalance due to stress regarding pregnancy or anything.So dont worry.Avoid stress.Practice regular intercourse to increase the chances of conception.Best regards..."},{"Patient":"Im 33 weeks pregnant with my second child and have been getting cramp like pain in my lower left side of my stomach and also sharp stabbing like pain in my vagina.

They happen in either ectopic pregnancy, non-viable baby or blighted ovum. Since you have 4 embryos implanted, the pregnancy test should be definitively positive after 10 days.

Sabitha, If you had your menses on 2 Oct., it is barely 9-10 weeks now. At such a early phase of pregnancy, the abdomen does not bulge out. The womb is still within the bones of the waist and hence cannot be felt or seen.  However, your breast symptoms, frequent urination and nausea & vomiting  may appear at this stage of pregnancy. Still, only on these symptoms, the pregnancy can be suspected but not diagnosed. Please get your urine pregnancy test done. It will be definitely decisive at this stage.

If you want to do beta HCG levels you should also do them at 4 weeks that is the day of the missed period, and repeat them after 48 hours. Your previous pregnancy HCG levels would have been back to non pregnant levels by 20 days after the miscarriage so you have nothing to worry about, as you are way past that time.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi! I am 2 weeks 3 days late on my period and noticed today that when I squeezed my breast (pretty hard) the clear liquid, I believe it's called colostrum, began to come out. It was not a large amount. I had a baby 14 months ago and noticed during my pregnancy I could squeeze my breast to produce the clear liquid. I have taken 2 at home pregnancy tests and they both have come back negative. Does the fact that I can squeeze this liquid from my breasts mean I'm pregnant again?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Missed period associated with colostrum secretion from the nipples would definitely point towards pregnancy. However, two things should be taken in to consideration. Your baby is just 14 months young. So it is likely that the milk from the previous breastfeeding has still not disappeared and is now getting expressed on squeezing. But then it would be milk and not the colostrum.More than 15 days after missed period,  the urine pregnancy test does give reliable results. However, your UPT is showing negative results. So the chances of pregnancy are remote. Still considering missed period with breast secretions, I would advise you to get Beta hCG test performed. This test is very specific and sensitive and gives reliable results within a couple of days of missed period. The other option for you is to undergo ultrasonography which, by this time, will give you direct visual evidence of the status of your pregnancy. If you are not pregnant, you may take Tab. Deviry for 5 days and then discontinue. You will get menses within 4-7 days after that. If you are pregnant and you do not want the pregnancy, you can terminate the pregnancy by Tab. Mifepristone and Tab. Misoprostol by Obstetrician's prescription and advice. Hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I had a CS in the 33rd week of pregnancy in June 2010.

Regards, Anja (Slovenia)","Doctor":"Dear Anja,You have waited for more than sufficient time. Usually the uterine scar of the caesarean section gets healed firmly by 6 weeks after surgery. Still we advise to have at least 3 years gap between the two pregnancies if one is by caesarean section. It is now 5 years that have passed after your previous caesarean section. Now you can safely go for pregnancy. Hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hi, I took a Dollar store pregnancy test and it came out negative, but I'm not sure if it's accurate. I've looked up common early signs of pregnancy, and I seem to have most of them. Is it possible that the test is wrong? Or that I've taken it too early?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,The routine urine test for pregnancy detection gives reliable results 8-10 days after missed period. If this test is done earlier, the chances of false negative tests are high. Beta hCG test is very specific and sensitive test. It gives reliable results within 2-3 days, or even before the missed period. Another test is ultrasonography. It gives direct visual evidence of the pregnancy status. However, it also is reliable about a week to ten days after missed period. Hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hello; My daughter is 18 and in her 6th month of pregnancy.

But when I look at it (after having scratched) it clearly appears as if the very upper thin skin layer has been removed and is fleshy in appearance.

I am at 40th day, still not yet get periods, Pregnancy Test is passed. We are not prepared for Pregnancy now. Can you please advise possible solutions to STOP pregnancy? Recommend medicines / tips etc.","Doctor":"Hi,    I understand your concern.    If your wife has a confirmed pregnancy.. & you are not prepared for pregnancy, I would request to give a second thought. For if you intend to have a child, why not this one ? medical termination of pregnancy can be done by medicine .. The procedure though looks simple can have side effects ( if not taken care of in time )which are not desirable.    Any way, if both of you are firm on stopping the pregnancy you can use MTP kit . It terminates pregnancy upto 63 days.      Kit contains two type of pills  -       - 1 pill of Mifepristin 200 mg  &        -4 pills of Misoprostol 200mcg each.    Single pill of Mifepristin is to be taken orally .After 2 days  it is followed by  4 pills of Misoprostol vaginally.  Abortion usually follows in 4 hours of Misoprostol. If not additional dose of Misoprostol can be given orally or vaginally.    * I would stress to get the MTP done under a gynecologist's guidance.. to avoid any untoward problems. Like ectopic pregnancy/ excessive bleeding/ incomplete abortion/ infection .

You should get your bile salts checked, which can be elevated in obstetric cholestasis.Also, viral markers to rule out infective hepatitis needs to be done.Obstetric cholestasis is unique to pregnancy and subsides after delivery.You will need monitoring of liver enzymes weekly during pregnancy. Rarely , it can affect fetus as well, some doctors consider delivery at 37 weeks to decrease fetal morbidity.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 23 weeks pregnant and have had TSH levels of 2.99, in the 3 range, and now its at 4.

Should I insist on being put on medication to control thyroid? What risk has my baby been exposed to since I am not being medicated?","Doctor":"Hi,We advise women to maintain thyroid levels below 3, after 13 weeks till delivery.For this thyroid supplements can be taken which are absolutely safe.Low thyroid (high TSH) can cause low birth weight, pre-eclampsia, delayed developmental mile stones and increased complications during labour and delivery.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Yep I have a question. I am on my 4th month of clomid, & my husband & I have been trying for 6 years! I m 30 and my hubby is 31.

I really hope we don t have to go to the next route!! However, he has anxiety issues 2 so that could be playing a part in this too.","Doctor":"Hi,With 6 years of infertility and 3 failed Clomid cycles. I would advise you to reconsider your options. Clomid is helpful only if you have diagnosed PCOS, if not then its better to consider an IVF cycle. Success rate of IVF is up to 40%, unlike 10% of the Clomid cycle. I would advise you to get analysis done and refer a good IVF specialist for further treatment.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"I've been on the depo shot since i was thirteen years old, and been on it for five year since i was thirteen. I havent been trying to get pregnant when i got of at seventeen, and now that im trying to at the age of 21 and its been hard, is it because of the shot, or could it be other options","Doctor":"Hi,I do not think it is due to the depot shot that you are unable to get pregnant.Even if depot shots delay pregnancy its only for 3-4 months. But since you have stopped it almost 4 years ago, it is not the reason you are not conceiving.You and your partner need to get evaluated for other causes.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi I had a situation and I was wondering if you can answer this question for me.

Is it like for me to get pregnant within that range of my period and that situation occuring?","Doctor":"HI,   I understand your concern.    You had unprotected sex on 7th & 8th day of menstrual cycle.. a sex around ovulation can result in pregnancy. If you have a regular 28 or 30 days cycle, it's not likely that you would conceive  on 8th/ 7th day of cycle, as that falls in safe period.    You need to wait for your normal period. If it's delayed till 8 days you can exclude pregnancy by UTP.   Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi! I am 7 weeks pregnant and suffering severe morning sickness.

But taking routine treatment during the remission is important. - Consult a dietitian & get advise for nutrients you can safely take for fulling your pregnancy needs.  _ Be careful to consult & follow doctor's advise during flareups.Aminosalicylates/ corticosteroids/ immuno suppressive drugs are considered to be safe in pregnancy.

Retaing for few minutes suffices for getting conceived.. as even a drop of semen has millions of sperms. If you are worried of the leaking after sex..Don't get up immediately, try to sleep with a pillow under your back for half an hour after sex.   - You should try for checking semen analysis.. to confirm it to be normal.& take treatment if there is less number of sperms/ with poor motility.Also get your self checked for normality of ovulation.

IT's natural that you are anxious about your child's normality. If the  usg sacn  has reveled normal fetus at 3 months , please rest assured for a normal conception.

One person said that drinking lots of water will help restore some of the amneotic fluid lost, is this true? Steve","Doctor":"Hi,    I understand your concern      The exact cause of rupture membranes is not known. mostly it is associated with history of fall/ incompetant os/ undernourished & weak mother/ twin pregnancies/ hydramnios/ some fetal abnormalities. Rupture of membranes mostly ends in delivery/ complications. A normal delivery is possible, in cases of rupture of membranes at term/ those who approach doctor & get treated meticulously.      Rupture of membranes is mostly felt by the lady as a sudden gush of warm fluid out of uterus.,.. which continues to dribble out,  changes it' s color .The discharge increases on coughing/ straining. Your wife did not have such symptoms.& the diagnosis was  while  the scanning . I doubt weather it is really  a ruptured membrane or  reduction of amniotic fluid.. which is a totally separate condition , can be treated by specific treatment.    * I would advise you to consult a gynecologist, get thoroughly examined / investigated ( as per need ) & start with treatment advised  strictly.

You seem to have either digestive problem/ infection of bowels which give you such symptoms of alternate loose motions & constipation.     A through history, physical examination & stool examination (if advised ) would pin point the cause of problem followed by treatment which may contain antibiotics/ anti amebics/ digestive enzymes as per need.     - Small & frequent servings help digestion in pregnancy.    - Regular yoga exercises & walking  help good appetite/digestion of food     - Constipation without any infection of bowels indicates less intake of fibers in diet/ less water intake.

Though traveling  by bus can be safe in pregnancy , provided the roads are good & vehicle has good shock ups, thus avoiding jerks .But traveling for 4 hours is not advisable, even if you avoid jerks .

Yes, delayed periods is first sign of pregnancy. Still it needs to be confirmed by UPT after 8 days delay in periods.    In your wife's case.. she had sex on 9th day of her menses. ant unprotected sex around ovulation day is likely to result in pregnancy & Ovulation is 14 days prior to expected day of menses ( it' s 14th day in case of 28 days cycle. So pregnancy can  be possible if your wife has regular & shorter cycles OR irregular cycles.   The medicines she had started from 3rd December if hormonal medicne,may delay  periods .

Relaxin ointment is released in early pregnancy , it increases in first 3 months as placental & pre placental tissues start adding to it's production.

You should keep your body & mind relaxed. Try to co operate & enjoy the deep penetration & deposition of ejaculate at mouth of cervix.If it still pains, Use of lignocain gel along with lubricant can be tried. local examination by a gynecologist is needful.    - Try to lie down with a pillow under your buttocks .. to retain the ejaculate in & facilitate sperm entry in uterus.

I have had no pms symptoms at all.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Urine test for detection of pregnancy as early as five days after missed period may give false negative results some times. You may repeat the test after 5 more days to have reliable results. The other option is to go for Beta hCG test which is very specific and sensitive. This test gives reliable results even 2-3 days or even earlier after missed period. If all these tests reveal that you are not pregnant, and you do not get your menses, you may take Deviry pills for 5 days. 4-7 days after discontinuing Devery, you should get your menses. I am sure this helps you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hello Mam, I am 10 months married and my last periods were on 19th July (As per my normal period cycle which is 28-30 days). We planned for a baby and missed my periods in Aug. On 25th Aug I tested with HCG strip at home and it was positive. Consulted a doctor and she told me to start taking folic acid. Suddenly on 31st Aug I had stomach ache, vomitings and pain on my right side. I went to the doctor, she gave me the medicines (painkiller and for acidity) and told me to go for urine routine and culture as I had UTI (e.coli) twice. First time I had UTI in month of March and was on antibiotics for about 5 days and later on continued with medicines till April (vitioxy, niftran). In the month of May I again had UTI and was hospitalized for a week on more strong antibiotics injections and continued with medicines for a month as per prescription. On 4th Sept I had stomach ache again cramping and later on spotting which finally turned to bleeding. I went to doctor late night and after an ultrasound I came to know that mine was Ectopic Pregnancy and baby is in my right fallopian tube and need to be aborted immediately through laparoscopy. I am very much tensed about this ectopic pregnancy as now my right tube has been removed and wants to know the reason for having Ectopic Pregnancy. Is it somewhere related to UTI which I had twice earlier or my profession, as I am a teacher which means I need to continuously up down or stand for 7-8 Hours a day or it is due to some negligence in our day to day activities? Also want to know that will it affect my ability to conceive in future and are there any types of test which can be done to check the health of left tube?","Doctor":"HI,    I understand your concern.     UTI restricted to urinary tract need not cause difficulty in conception. Yes, but if the infection had spread to genital tract ( with white discharge, pain in lower abdomen- pelvic inflammation ).. leading to inflammation of Fallopian tubes.. may increase chance of ectopic pregnancy. BUt without inflammation of tubes, recurrence of tubal pregnancy is not common. Even conception rate is not very much affected with one healthy tube remaining after removal of other .    Your profession is not likely to affect UTI.. only thing is your water intake & urination should  not be neglected.  * I would advise you for a detailed examination by a gynecologist with necessary investigations.. to ascertain cure ot UTI/ normalcy of your left tube, before you plan for next baby. Have a regular urine check up after conception.. to avoid garver complications of UTI on pregnancy.    Please don't be tense. to be careful & prevent problems is  asafe way to have a positive result.

The pain you have at your belley button & above seems to be due to overstretched abdomen following a heavy meal/ indigestion / constipation producing lot of gasses, thus stretching abdomen again.A bit of swelling due to itching/ infection at umbilicus can add to the pain.     Baby movements in uterus reflects the pressure all over in  amniotic fluid momentarily... which is unbearable to you at umbilicus.   * I feel taking carminative mixture ,/ butter milk with cumin seed powder & asafoetida ( hing ) powder or fruit salt..would help expulsion of gasses & relieve you.

Progesterone is known to cause sluggishness of the intestinal motility leading to constipation and/or bloating. Since you are not having constipation, it is likely that you are having either worm infestation or amoebic dysentery. Please get your stools examined after an overnight purge. The worms will require deworming while the amoebiasis can be dealt with Metronidazole. Please make it a habit to walk for about an hour after each meals before lying down. This will help you.

Also would the palpitations/missed beats cause any damage/stress to my unborn baby?","Doctor":"Hallow Mumma,Palpitations and missed beat any time during life is a warning signal. You should report to your physician for evaluation of your heart function. Severe anaemia may also cause such signs. Get your haemoglobin estimated. Tiredness and fatigue with history of Thyroid dysfunction calls for your evaluation of Thyroid function. It also can cause palpitations. Get your T3, T4 and TSH estimated in your blood. It is good that you have your appointment with the Obstetrician tomorrow. Brief him/her all your symptoms and get all the investigations done. Accordingly you will have to start appropriate treatment.

You need to get evaluated for egg release function (ovulation). Along with it better get complete profile of the reproductive capability of both of you: 1. Ultrasonography, FSH, LH and Prolactin in blood will assess the ovulation.2. Laparoscopy and Hysterosalpingography will assess the patency of your genital tract.3. Semen examination of the husband.Depending up on the reports, further management will have to be planned.Wishing you best luck,Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Im 21 weeks pregnant and have been going to a family nightclub/dance party almost every fortnight.

However, the serial ultrasonography reports are indicating that your ovulation and conception could have been around June 13. However, you did not have any sexual relation between May 19 and June 27. This size does not match the conception on May 19 also. Did you have any sexual intercourse on or around June 13-15? That period seems to be the day of conception.The other possibility is large baby which has been conceived on June 27 or small baby conceived on May 19. The later possibility is remote. I would advise you to wait for a couple of months to assess the age of gestation since  as the pregnancy advances, the period variation in ultrasonography minimises. If you are so keen on ascertaining the paternity, you may opt for DNA test. I hope this helps you.

It could be due to some hormonal imbalance like Oestrogen-Progesterone and/or Thyroid. If this has happened only for this time, you may wait for couple of cycles. If the irregularity persists, you will have to get investigated for your hormonal profile by blood examination for FSH, LH, Prolactin, Oestrogen, Progesterone, T3, T4, TSH, and any other if indicated. For that you will have to report to the Gynaecologist. Such irregular menses are usually without egg release.

The bloating, hard abdomen and excessive movements in the abdomen you are feeling seem to be most likely due gaseous distension due to digestive problem.

This movement is felt by the mother from about 20 weeks  of the gestation or earlier. As the pregnancy advances, the water around the baby goes on diminishing and hence the movements of the baby are more perceived. You may please count the score of the movements. During 12 hours time if it is moving about 10 times, you do not have to worry. This is normal and is indicating a healthy active foetus. Any variation in the foetal movement count needs to be reported to the Obstetrician. I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"hi am in 21 weeks of pregnancy .

A fetal 2D echo of fetal heart can help see if baby has abnormalities of the heart .Termination depends on which country you reside in. In India it is absolutely not allowed after 20 weeks.The cells collected at amniocentesis can rule out any major genetic abnormality. Bilateral cleft lip can be surgically corrected after birth by a paediatric surgeon. Regular scan of the baby can help monitor if it is developing any abnormality.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"I just delivered twins on 06/26/10. They were 5 weeks and 1 day premature.

My doctors office just called me and told me that they forgot to review lab work with me from April saying I was Anemic. Is it possible that being Anemic in such a high risk pregnancy with out treatment could have caused me to have liver problems which forced me to deliver so early?","Doctor":"Hi,The liver problem that you have described seems to be due to increase in bile acids, which is a condition unique to pregnancy. It causes itching without rash and is relieved once delivery occurs. Anemia can cause increased risk of post delivery bleeding, need of blood transfusion during delivery or later, but would not be a reason for liver problems.Twins pregnancies are known to have an increased risk of complications, and also early delivery due to a variety of reasons both maternal and fetal.The high blood pressure, and the itching(obstetric cholestasis) could be the cause.For the anemia, I would advise you to take iron supplements and get your haemoglobin checked again after 1 months time.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"my partner and i have been trying for a baby for just over a month now. i was on cerezette for 4 years. we have had unprotected sex many times, however due to circumstances, i have decided to go back on the cerezette pill. my question is: i am worried if i go back on my pill and i am already pregnant? i have taken a pregnancy test today and it showed negitive, but it may not show up that i am pregnant yet.

This is because when the first is a cesarean, if you go into labour yourself the chances of a vaginal delivery are as high as 72%, but reduces if we have to induce pain by medications. Also if we induce pain there is a slightly higher chance of complications for mother and baby, if the induction fails and the operation has to be carried out in emergency. I would advice you to wait till due date and then decide in favor of cesarean if you don't go into labour.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi Dr, I wanna ask regarding my testicle condition..

If you have a very thin abdomen, it is possible to feel the bowel movement with hand palpation. Also, fetal movements cannot be felt until 14 weeks in a pregnancy and not as soon as a missed period. A cyst of the ovary can give you pain and menstrual disturbances, if symptomatic. A hanging fibroid of the uterus can be asymptomatic, but obvious on a pelvic sonogram. Please get further suggestions from a specialist in person.

So that is why probably the doctors are waiting till the EDD they have calculated. More over we wait up to 42 weeks to induce pains and upto 10 % of pregnancies are postdated, with normal outcomes. So you need not worry about it. Regarding the GBS, you will need intravenous antibiotics once you go into labour. This is to prevent your baby from getting the GBS.

The patches on your arms may or may not be related to the cause of the anal bleeding. The rise in pelvic pressure during pregnancy and the associated improved vascular supply can increase the tendency to formation of hemorrhoids, especially if one has to strain while passing a stool. Since you are bleeding even when not passing stool, a fissure or other local lesion has to be excluded also. Please see your health care provider to identify the cause/causes and get further management. A sigmoidoscopy may be needed. Avoid hard stool formation by increasing fiber diet, liquids and stool softeners as needed. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, I started bleeding 2 weeks earlier than my period.

So your is less likely to be implantation bleeding.    It's possibly the ovulatary bleeding.. whch occurs on the day of ovulation in few cases. Now if you had sex within 2-3 days of the bleeding, you may conceive & the funny  feeling( which is experienced so early very rarely ) and also delay in periods may suggest it.

It is also associated with some colicky pain in the abdomen . So I would not have any concern for this spotting. However, your pregnancy test needs some attention. It was weak positive. After your normal menses, such weak positive pregnancy test is rather mystery. Such week positive pregnancy test is due to low levels of hCG; which happens after baby becomes non-viable , abortion or ectopic pregnancy. However, your history is suggestive of none of these conditions. Please repeat the test again after about a weeks gap. If still it is positive or weak positive, report to the Gynaecologist. Hope this helps you,Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hi I am 7 weeks pregnant. Over 10 days ago, I was getting brown discharge and light spotting. I went to A&E and as it was too early the scan just showed a sac at 5 weeks. My hcg level was 23,000 which I think is high. My cervix was closed. The doctor ruled out an ectopic pregnancy. The doctor said things look ok but we have to wait for the 7 week scan. However, since last night I am getting bad back pain and mild abdominal pain as if I am going to start my period. I am getting yellowish discharge but no spotting. My scan is in four days.

I know I should go to the doctor and everything but it s also a very small area that I believe is a genital wart that you can barley see so I don t think they would remove it anyways. I know the wart can go away on its own or get bigger or stay the same and everything. My big question is can I eventually get the virus out of my system to not pass it on? I m getting different answers online some are saying 40% will get rid of it the first year then 80% by the second year and others are saying you can get rid of the warts but the virus will be with you forever and can be passed to partners forever. So which is it? I would like to do what ever I can to boost up my immune system to get it out as soon as possible so any suggestions ? I am in good health and good weight with no issues that I know of I work out 4 days a week for about an hour and a half each time and eat somewhat healthy so I think that s a good start I don t smoke but I use to and I use a vape now so is that bad for the immune system like smoking is? Any vitamins or anything I can do to help? Also I think I know who I got it from so if we keep sleeping together if one of us get it out of our system will we just give it back to each other or can you only get it once? I can t really find out any info on how that works.","Doctor":"Hi, You can consult a dermatologist and plan for cauterisation or  cryosurgery.

In fact whenever there is brown bleeding during any stage of pregnancy, the first suspicion is death of the baby. When brown bleeding takes place in the first three months, there is a possibility of old or stale abortion. However, in spite this when the abortion does not take place, we call it as Missed abortion. You had non-viable baby when you had first bout of brown bleeding. However, the hCG levels do not drop that fast to diagnose non-viable pregnancy. Only ultrasonography would have detected non-viable foetus at that stage. Now that your missed abortion is confirmed, it is advisable that you undergo the completion of termination of pregnancy ASAP as delay may lead to the complications like clotting disorders (DIC), infections, kidney failure, etc. Before you undergo any intervention, it is advisable to get investigated for DIC by Bleeding Time, Clotting Time, Prothrombin Time and Fibrinogen Degradation Products on your blood. I hope this has given you some guidance for further management of this condition.

All other symptoms like nausea & vomiting, frequent urination and the breast symptoms like engorgement with tenderness, dark discolouration of nipples & areola with widening of areola and secretions through nipples appear subsequently, usually 10 to 15 days after missed period. Though you had some vague symptoms, ultimately you have got your menses. Probably after having the menses, the symptoms also might have vanished. When in doubt, urine examination for pregnancy gives clue. That also is negative in your case.So Madam, no missed period and pregnancy test negatives confirms that you are not pregnant.

It seems you had D& C surgery done followed by hormonal treatment with the hope to set the hormonal imbalance back & have regular cycles.   It's essential to find cause of delayed period in first place.

If they have been identified on the HSG, they have to be treated by laparoscopic surgery if possible. So, the next step for you would be a  key hole surgery, where the surgeon will try to remove the blocks, it could be combined with a surgery called hysteroscopy, where the surgeon insert a tiny camera into  the womb and sees its lining.These will guide us with further management.The TORCH values should not concern you much, because once you have got an infection it is very unlikely that you will get it again during pregnancy. And these harm the pregnancy only if you get the infection during pregnancy and not prior to that. The IgG values indicate that you had been infected and are now immune.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"hello doc,i am suffer from pcod for last 2 year,my period is not regular when i take oral madicine than my period start..i am taking hyponidd for last six month ..bt problem is that i want to be conceive ..my doc has give to me sihhene 100mg .is it good ..can i am conceive plz tell me ...","Doctor":"HiDr. Purushottam welcomes you to HCM virtual clinic!Thanks for consulting at my virtual clinic.

If your attending doctor shows no concern toward your problem, please take a second opinion. The viability of the pregnancy should be established through a trans-vaginal sonogram. If there is any hemorrhage seen, the need to initiate hormone supplements must be thought of. Absolute bed rest, avoidance of all strenuous activity including sexual intercourse are mandatory. If needed, serial titres of serum beta-hCG may be taken since good progress of the pregnancy is seen when there are doubling titres every 2-3 days.

You should also test for the possibility of gestational diabetes and iron and protein deficiency since these are the other conditions that predispose to increased infections. Oral treatment can be given if needed absolutely since you have long passed the organogenesis stage. If you are sexually active, your partner also should be treated after proper examination. Abstinence should be followed until after your delivery since you are in the third trimester. The lump needs to be examined to give a decision as to what it is. It can be a clump of the flakes discharged from the vagina. Please maintain proper genital hygiene. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I'm pregnant with my 3rd baby (39 1/2 weeks).

The origin of your present complaint dates to the time of your sonogram. Your symptoms do suggest a fungal vaginitis.

You should immediately see your health care provider, get a proper examination and initiate treatment to control the infection.

The only way out to know if conception took place due to that sexual intercourse is to get an estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres 2 weeks after the act. This is the earliest and most predictable way. You can also get a HPT not earlier than 3 weeks after the incident. A trans-vaginal sonogram at the same time also helps.

You are out of danger of ectopic pregnancy. The ectopic pregnancy happens at the time of baby getting implanted; i.e. around 7 days before you miss your period. Regarding the antibiotics you have to take for the cyst in the fallopian tube:  First confirm that it is infective cyst and not the ectopic. If it is infection, you any take only the antibiotics that would not harm the baby. Tetracycline or its derivatives are to be avoided during any stage of pregnancy and breastfeeding. Your Obstetrician will choose only those antibiotics which are safe during the pregnancy. I hope this clears your dilemma.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"hello i just had my son 7 months ago i have unprotected sex and for the last couple of days i have had sore nipples i do breastfeed i thought maybe thats what it was breastfeeding to much but i dont because i have been having lower abdomen pain back pain and some shooting pains up my buttocks could i be pregnant","Doctor":"Hallow Mumma,The main question is whether you had started your menses after the delivery, or you are still without menses (locational amenorrhoea). It is possible that in this period, particularly when your baby is 7 months young, the eggs may start getting  released even though you do not have menses. Then the risk of pregnancy arises. However, if you have already started menstruating, missing a period will be the first symptom of pregnancy. As you have rightly suspected, breastfeeding could be a cause for the soreness in the nipples. The back pain shooting to your buttocks is most likely to be due to position and calcium deficiency which is very commonly seen in mothers breastfeeding their babies without taking calcium supplementation. Please start drinking at least 500 ml of milk daily in divided servings and supplement it by calcium tablets. If you can tell me about your menstrual history by asking  me Direct question, I can further opine on the possibility of pregnancy. However, since your baby is now 7 months young, it is advisable that you start on to some reliable birth control method like birth control pills, condom or intrauterine device. Hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I am seven weeks pregnant and I am having acute very lower stomache pains.

Progesterone is required to stabilize the pregnancy. In some cases where there is progesterone deficiency, we give progesterone to the mothers. So you need not worry about it. However, you are not sure whether you are pregnant or not. Moreover, you have taken Primolut, so your menses will be delayed. Please do not become panicky for delayed menses. After you have discontinued the Primolut, you should get menses within 4-7 days. If you do not get them even after 10 days, then you may get your urine tested for detection of pregnancy. Till that relax.

A couple days ago my boyfriend came inside of me. Last night i threw up 20 minutes after i took my pill so i m not sure if it settled in my system. is there a chance i could be pregnant.?","Doctor":"Hallow dear,Birth control pills are reproductory hormones and they act with uninterrupted action on the woman's reproductory system. In fact woman's ovaries release only one egg per cycle. Before that it has to get matured. This is happening by continuous action of the natural hormones produced in the body. Birth control pills interfere in this process by changing the levels of reproductory hormones in the body. Hence they also have to be continuous and uninterrupted. Irregularity in the pills cannot inhibit the actions of natural hormones effectively and pregnancy may result. If you are irregular in taking the birth control pills, you do have risk of pregnancy due to unprotected sexual intercourse. Hence, it will be a safe step to take emergency contraceptive within 24 hours, but not later than 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. If you have not, the risk of pregnancy remains. Since you were irregular in taking the pills, it is rather difficult to predict when your menses will come; however they are likely to be earlier than later. If you miss period, get your urine tested for pregnancy detection 8 days after missed period. Earlier these tests may show false negative results. Beta hCG tests are more sensitive and can give you reliable results within 2-3 days of missed period, may be even earlier. Hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I am 32 weeks pregnant, was just seen at the doctor yesterday. I had a slightly high BP. I am having regular, timed, BH contractions.

The hormones in the pills can cause these side effects. Moreover, they may get worst due to this hormones threatening your health. So please switch over to some other safe birth control method like condom or intrauterine birth control device (without any hormones in it). I hope this helps you.

Can you tell me what it might be please?","Doctor":"Hallow Mumma to be,It seems you have  started feeling the symptoms of initiation of labour. If this is your first pregnancy, the cervix gets prepared  by getting merged in to the uterus. This is giving you the feeling you are getting. Moreover, the head of the baby is descending into your bony passage of the waist. Therefore you are feeling pressure in the lower abdomen. In first labour, these things happen before you actually land in labour. You be prepared to receive your baby now.

I have been booked into the day unit at my local hospital tomorrow and monday for monitoring and again on wed with another scan. What could be the problem as i was not really told anything? I am also measuring 30weeks with the midwife? Thank you in advance Helen","Doctor":"Hi Helen, I have read through your query and feel that, the smaller abdominal circumference and smaller baby size indicate that the baby is having intra uterine growth restriction. The babies special sonography called Doppler studies needs to be done to know the type of blood flow into the placenta. This could be due to your previous history of Pre-eclampsia and HELLP , women with these are known to have more likelyhood of smaller babies in future pregnancies. Along with regular Doppler and fetal heart rate tracing of the baby, your BP and urine albumin need to be measured as it is likely that you can get pre-eclampsia again.If the Doppler studies indicate abnormal blood flow and ultrasound show that the baby is not growing as expected and the fluid around the baby is getting less, early delivery may have to be considered.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello, My question is why am I getting a negative pregnancy results when I am experiencing many  many pregnancy symptoms?

Sexually transmitted diseases are known to occur together, so you should get checked for other STDs as well.

What about your partner, he will require treatment as well.If your symptoms don't improve and you are not able to swallow the antibiotic due to nausea or vomiting, you will require admission in a hospital and IV antibiotics.You should repeat pregnancy test after 2 weeks if you still don't get your period.Taking immediate treatment for STD is essential in preventing future complications.Hope this  helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, I am 29 week pregnant and having some kind of cramping and loose motions from last two weeks..though m feeling fit now..and taking medicine..but my gynae stops me to take iron calcium etc..i just want to know..does this impact my baby..or not..means m little worry about the growth of the baby..","Doctor":"Hi,Iron and calcium are just supplements given, when we feel that maternal diet may not be able to provide adequate quantities of them.Iron is known to cause diarrhea / constipation and a metallic taste.

I started on predison when i was about 15 weeks and havnt stopped taking it since then. its the only thing that helps me with the pain.","Doctor":"Hi,Yes, if your condition warrants that you take prednisolone, it is fine to take it during pregnancy. Please continue it, as abrupt stopping of the drug can cause harm. Also when you go into labour this oral prednisolone will have to change to injection hydrocortisone drip as, sudden stoppage of prednisolone can cause symptoms of steroid withdrawal, which could complicate delivery, and affect you and the baby.Prednisolone does not cross the placenta and so minimally affects the baby. It is known to cause very rarely a condition called, cleft palate, where a part of the mouth of the baby is ill developed. But it occurs if taken before 15 weeks and it can be ruled out on the 20 weeks anomaly scan.

Your wife will require anti D injections at 28 weeks of pregnancy and after delivery. Also if she has certain complications during pregnancy she may require anti D.Rhesus negative pregnancy usually do not cause a problem in first pregnancy, but if anti D is not considered and given in first pregnancy it can cause problem in the next pregnancy.In the pre-pregnancy, she should have healthy diet and lifestyle and also take Folic acid 400 micrograms daily till she gets pregnant and continue it till 12 weeks of pregnancy.She should inform her treating gynecologist about her negative blood group.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"I am 15 weeks pregnant and im suffering from severe piles and constipation. 1 doc told me not to take cremaffin , another doc said I could take cremaffin . please advise if i can take a samll teaspoon of cremaffin plus at bed time as it really helps ?","Doctor":"Hi,Yes, cremaffin can be taken to treat constipation. All medications are advised with caution during pregnancy. But cremaffin is not known to cause any complications or side effects. Only concern is it could be habit forming and you could get dependent on it.But if you have pills and constipation, it is advisable to take cremaffin rather than suffer from  the pills. You can get definitive treatment for piles after delivery. Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctar. I am two and half months pregnant.

For you it is in the womb so you can be reassured.Also regarding the small echogenic area, it could a be a small collection of blood behind the placenta which gets absorbed on its own as the pregnancy advances.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"I m 26 years old, and we have been trying to conceive for Eight months. I have a 28-day period, and I experience all the symptoms of ovulation, but I also have severe PMS. Is that the reason why I m not getting pregnant? I start to take Ovacare, Ebexid and Fertomid-50 mg with the consultation of my docotor after three months there is any chances for getting pregnant! please suggest!","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Pre menstrual syndrome does not affect the fertility as they are just the subjective symptoms a woman feels. You have been put on Ebexid (for thyroid dysfunction), Ovacare and Fertomid (for ovulation problems). I hope these dysfunctions are confirmed after due investigations before stating this treatment. Now you have to monitor your ovulation either by ovulation monitoring kit or by ultrasonography. Accordingly you have to plan your sexual intercourse. Usually the follicle in the ovary ruptures after it reaches 18 mm size. If it does not rupture naturally, it may have to be induced by hCG injection. Usually within 24 hours after hCG, the ovulation takes place. The egg or ovum has a life of 24 hours while the sperms are 72 hours active. Hence, a period of about one week around the day of ovulation is considered as fertile period. If you can plan your marital relations during this Fertile window, the chances of success are more. Please note that the ovum released after the follicle has crossed the size of 21 mm size does not have that good chance of getting fertilized or to carry on with successful pregnancy. During ovulation monitoring by ultrasonography, the endometrium is also visualized. Endometrium of about 10 mm or more in thickness is very conducive for implantation of fertilized ovum. Considering these fact, you can adjust your life-style in the pursue of desired pregnancy. If you have any more doubts, or want any more information, you may ask me by Direct question.

Since you had some bleeding, it should be noted if there is a low lying placenta or placenta praevia, or an abruption of the placenta. Management varies with each case. Either way, you need absolute rest preferably with elevation of the foot end, monitoring of fluid and electrolyte balance and observation with further sonograms if necessary. Please avoid strain throughout pregnancy. The rash does not mean any mineral deficiency; it can be some allergy and a dermatologist should be consulted for proper treatment.

My period is was due on November the 8th and it came down on the 5th for 4 days light. I still feel bloated and light sore nipples but preganacy test was negative yesterday please help.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,It is but natural that you are suspecting missed  period as the bleeding was light. However, if the urine pregnancy test has given you negative result, you have to have another confirmation, as urine pregnancy tests may give false negative results in the first week after missed period. I would advice you to go for Beta hCG test which is highly sensitive and very specific test for diagnosing pregnancy. This test can give reliable results as early as 2-3 days after missed period, even before that also. I am surprised to note that you took Clomiphene tablets just for 3 days. Usual course is for 5 days. After completing the Clomiphene tablets, it is advisable to monitor the ovulation by ultrasonography. The sexual intercourse is to be adjusted on and around the day of ovulation. Usually the egg is matured when the follicle has attained the size of 18 mm. If the ovulation takes place after the follicular size of 21 mm, the results in terms of pregnancy are not good. If the follicle does not rupture naturally, Inj. hCG is given to induce the ovulation. From the day of the injection, you should have at least alternate day sexual relations.

If you do not want this pregnancy because your child is very young, you may go for termination of pregnancy by Tab. Mifepristone and Tab. Misoprostol. These medicines are not over the counter medicines. They should be taken by an Obstetrician's prescription and advice only. They are very safe and effective medicines to terminate the pregnancy up to 9 weeks of gestation. These medicines are known cause developmental abnormalities in the baby. Hence, once these medicines are taken, you should not change the decision to continue the pregnancy. In future, to avoid such situations, please practise reliable birth control method like birth control pills, condom or intrauterine contraceptive device.

Hi, my question is that I alway have my period rite but this month When I got my period for 3days I was spotting ant then for 5days I was bleeding and then I had sex with my husband but We didn t use protection can I still get pregnant?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,The 3 days spotting you had was premenstrual spotting. The menstruation is to be counted from the day you has normal bleeding for 5 days. If immediately after that you had intercourse with your husband, there is most remote possibility (practically no possibility) of pregnancy. The egg gets released 14 days prior to the next expected menstruation. The egg has life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. Therefore a period of about a week around the day of egg release is the Fertile Window. Your intercourse was far away from this period. So the chances of pregnancy are almost nil.

Usually, a period of two weeks to one month is suggested after live vaccine injections. Since these are only prophylactic procedures, there is no specific restriction, but, as a safety precaution, you can use temporary contraception for 6-8 weeks at least. Please use prenatal vitamins right from now on. You can also see a specialist once you settle down for further plans.

Since you are bleeding slightly, it would be a better idea to go for an estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres. This gives a better clarification. Your symptoms can happen with a hormone imbalance as well as a very early pregnancy. A sonogram of the pelvis, preferably in the trans-vaginal route, also helps to exclude pregnancy.

You had successful fertilization. However, if there are chromosomal defects in the baby which are not compatible to continue the pregnancy, it will abort. However, repeating the same faults suggests that the egg donor and/or sperms could be having such a fault that even after the successful fertilization, the pregnancy cannot continue. You better take opinion of Foetal medicine specialist. Was the thickness of uterine lining (Endometrium) monitored at the time of embryo transfer? At least 10 mm thick endometrium is required for healthy implantation. Moreover, after the implantation is successful, enough hormonal back up, particularly Progesterone is needed. The levels of Progesterone can be measured in the blood and monitored accordingly. If there is Progesterone deficiency, it can be reinforced by external Progesterone. At this age, it is very likely that your endometrium may not be conducive to continue the pregnancy. At this age, I would suggest you adoption of a needy baby.  I hope this gives you some direction before you attempt your next IVF.

Almox contains Amoxycillin which is considered safer in pregnancy. Metrogyl contains Metronidazole, which is a category B drug and so is Ranitidine.

So even if this is threatened abortion, attempts can be made to salvage the pregnancy. May be you will be given Progestational preparations. 2. Report to your Obstetrician for proper evaluation. 3.

Kindly advise us?","Doctor":"Hi,Readiness for IVF will depend on a number of factors. Male factor will be checked by semen analysis. Your ovaries at 49 years may not be having enough reserve of eggs. This has to be confirmed by AMH levels. Also are you open to oocyte donation and does the IVF clinic you are planning to go to offer it?Your lining of the womb needs to be checked by ultrasound and hormonal support needs to  be given to help the embryo to stick this will require alot of planning. Also any other factors like fibroids and endometriosis needs to be ruled out. The likely hood of successful IVF is inverse to the age of the mother .So, for you the chances are much less compared to a women less than 35 years.Actual figures depend on the clinic.Yes you can travel a day or two after IVF.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"i have ehlers danlos syndrome im 6 months plus pregnant,this will be my forth baby and im 33 yrs old,i was told about 9 years ago i had a slight fray in my aorta, nothing to worry about though.this morning i woke up and after a very restless night i was sick,ive felt bad all day and about 25 mins ago my heart started beating very fast and im finding it heard to take a deep breath. is this ok??","Doctor":"as you have ehler danlos syndrome then I would suggest you not to get worried as these symptoms can occur in ehler danlos syndrome ,so take good amount of bed rest and get a echocardiography done to exclude other pathology also get your ultrasound done at regular intervals"},{"Patient":"I am 35 weeks pregnant with Gestational diabetes.

This month I had no sign of period on due date. Then I had pinkish blood streaked clear discharge. This was intermittent for few days and now very light bleed that hardly needs any protection. I took a recent pregnancy test but this was negative. What could this be please?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Just a pinkish streak without considerable bleeding may be considered as missed period. The usual urine pregnancy tests are reliable after about a week of missed period, earlier they may give false negative results. However, Beta hCG tests are very specific and sensitive and may give reliable results within 2-3 days after missed period, or even earlier.  You may opt for this test. Another possibility of unruptured ectopic pregnancy may be kept in mind. However, usually it gives faint positive result. If it is confirmed that you are not pregnant, you may take birth control pills for 5 days. Please do not take Deviry like Progesterone only pills since they minimize the bleeding. You should get normal bleeding 4-7 days after discontinuation of the pills.  If still you do not get bleeding, please report to the Gynaecologist for your hormonal evaluation. You may be developing Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS).I hope this helps you.

A hard stool usually causes trauma to the mucosal layer as it passes over it and more so when there is a need to strain. This can happen in pregnancy owing to pressure effects. Yet, you should report the matter to your consultant and see everything is fine with your pregnancy. Please increase your dietary fiber and liquids, do mild exercise if permitted and also use stool softeners if needed.

I happened to be 6 weeks pregnant and according to my transvaginal ultrasound, my baby has a small sac. My Ob gave me Duphaston, 30pcs, to be taken 2X a day. Is ot safe for the baby?

I am deeply worried but I have no choice but to take it because it was prescribed by my OB. Many many many thanks!","Doctor":"Hi,Duphaston is given as it a progesterone hormone containing drug, this progesterone is required to maintain the lining of the womb, especially when there is a doubt about survival of the pregnancy. Which is why the doctor must have prescribed you the Duphaston.No, Duphaston does not cause any fetal defects. And it does not harm the baby. It causes abdominal bloating, breast tenderness in the mother when she is taking it.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 10 weeks pregnant and I have been having a lot of lower abdominal pain that last long periods of time and always start when I am at work standing for a while I went to my doctor the other day and we found out that I have a backwards womb, can that really be causing a lot of pain or should I be worried I am not sure I should wait it out or get help now, I have an ultrasound book for the 21","Doctor":"Hi,Retroverted uterus or backward-facing uterus is seen in 20-30 percent of women. The causes are several like endometriosis, fibroids etc. and it can also be a natural phenomena. In pregnancy, correction usually takes place at 10-12 weeks. The uterus grows into an abdominal organ most often without any interruption. A sonogram of the pelvis will help to rule out any untoward effects. You should lie on your abdomen for a few hours everyday for a few days to help the ascent and correction as posture helps the uterus to fall forward.

It also depends on other factors like maternal age, gestational age, and other factors. Your baby's report is slightly above the normal range, Normally its less than 2.8. Other blood investigation like triple or quadruple tests should be done and correlated with the scan.I hope this suggestion might be of some help to you.

Since I found out about this, I started taking one-a-day prenatal vitamins. These tablets have 4000IU of Vitamin A, 50% in the form of Beta Carotene. My question has to do with my vitamin A intake. I eat a lot of vegetables, lots of leafy greens and spinach, and fruits, mostly grapes and apples. These are also rich in Vitamin A, in Beta Carotene form. Does this constitute a potential threat to the health of the developing embryo? I am not taking any other preformed Vitamin A other than these tablets-- except for the little amount in the fortified milk, perhaps. Could you please guide me about the limits of Vitamin A intake in the form of Beta Carotene? Should I cut back on spinach and other fruits and veggies? Thank you!","Doctor":"Hi,Vitamin A is a type of vitamin which gets stored in liver over time and person taking lots of vegetables and fruits are not deficient of it .In pregnancy excess vitamin A, more than 10,000 IU per day can cause defects in the baby and liver toxicity in the mother.Since you are having adequate intake of in your diet, I would advice you to change your prenatal vitamin to one which does not have vitamin A.Regarding beta carotene 12 micro grams of beta carotene makes approx. 3 IU of vitamin A.Just take folic acid 400 micrograms till 12 weeks.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"I have a friend going through a custody battle and his wife smoked marijuana and took Vicodin while pregnant with his twins.

A lot depends on the source of marijauna itself as if it is contaminated, then the complications will increase.But it is very very unlikely that any thing will show on blood, urine or hair follicle test conducted.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"I am currently 28 weeks pregnant, at my last ante-natal appointment I had + protein in my urine.

If found to be high or if you develop any complication such as headache,  epigastric pain then you should contact the doctor immediately.At 39 weeks the doctor should discuss if you could be induced, or a repeat caesarean would be appropriate.

Since having it removed I ve had irregular periods and I don t ovulate. I had laparoscopic surgery and my OBGYN said that everything looks great and that I m extremely fertile but my ovaries aren t releasing my eggs.

So the treatment for you is to induce ovulation. Unfortunately, your ovaries have not responded to Clomiphene citrate (Clomid) which is a primary line of treatment.Now the other option for you is to go for HMG + HCG combination. HMG causes the maturation of the follicles in the ovaries. When a follicle attains the desired size of about 18 mm and the blood hormonal values satisfy the criteria, HCG is given to cause the ovulation from the matured ovum. Accordingly you can adjust the sexual intercourse on or around the day of egg release.I hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"I’ve been searching for an answer even with my own Doctor but he seems to believe it’s over exertion.

Please help.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,The gestational age of the baby is in fact the actual age of the baby. Naturally it is from the day of conception. However, it is not possible in day to day life to locate the day of conception. Hence it is customary to calculate the day of expected due date of delivery or even the duration of pregnancy from the date of last menstrual period. This is the clinical way of assessing the duration of pregnancy. Total duration of pregnancy which is said 280 days is counted from the date of last menstrual period.Ultrasound calculates the duration of pregnancy according to the measurements of the baby. It has some error factor ranging from 2 weeks to few days depending upon the stage and duration of pregnancy. I hope this gives you clear knowledge about the age of the baby.

Certain skin conditions are more common in pregnancy and these need to be identified by a doctor before treatment.Triderm is not contraindicated in pregnancy, but should be used with caution and the skin where it is applied should not be covered by anything as this can increase the absorption the drug, and cause more side effects.Do not use it without a doctors advise.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"hi doctor i have pcos and am pregnent and recently discovered in ultrasound that my baby having cyst in cord i.e;in brain iam 20 weeks pregnent iam concern about my baby will that cyst effect my baby in any ways and can i get ride or is there any permanent cure for this pcos","Doctor":"Hi,PCOS and cyst in brain of your child are two unrelated things.Cyst in brain or spinal cord are called as neural tube defects and can affect the development of the baby, depending on their size and location.You need to get a detailed scan done by an fetal medicine specialist, to know that exact nature of the cysts. Also the babies head needs to be checked for excessive fluid (called Hydrocephalus), as these are known to occur together and can affect the baby.The fetal medicine expert can further guide you regarding the prognosis of the baby depending on size and location of the cyst.Some of these cysts are correctable after delivery for which you will need to be in touch with a pediatric neurosurgeon.You have conceived, so it means your PCOS is in control. If you have irregular periods after 6 months of delivery, then you can take medications for it.Also Women with PCOS are prone for gestational diabetes, do get your sugar levels checked.Also consider folic acid 5 mg at least 3 months before the next pregnancy as folic acid is known to protect against neural tube defects.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"I am 5 weeks pregnant and was on 50 mg eltroxin for a month(since dec4 2010 to jan 3rd 2011)I had a check of TSH hormone on 3rd.Both T3 and T4 levels were in the normal range.so my physician asked me to reduce the dosage to 25 mg.but my gynaec says that throxine requirement is more during pregnancy..just confused as to wether i should continue with 50 mg or 25 mg?","Doctor":"Hi,The range of TSH to be followed for pregnancy is different than in non pregnant women.The normal values for first three months of pregnancy is less than 2.5 mIU/L, for the last six months of pregnancy is 3.0 mIU/L. For, the non pregnant it is 4.5 mIU/L. So everything depends on your present TSH levels if they are below 2.5 then you can take 25 mg of thyroxin , but if they are above 2.5, I would advice you to take 50mg.High TSH values have shown to affect the pregnancy and it is advisable to keep levels in the range described above.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hpi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

Still in Rh incompatibility, pregnancy has to be  strictly under doctor's vigilance & care.. all the instructions should be followed positively, for a good pregnancy out come.  * Papain test + ve indicates presence of hormone Papain in blood. It's an extract of fruit papaya.. and is given in pain, inflammation conditions. It is not indicated in pregnancy .. as it cause blood thinning & may cause excessive bleeding.

But once pregnant, if you have pain due to gallstones and they require removal or treatment the pregnancy could be affected. So, I would advise you to get treatment for the gall stones before embarking on a pregnancy.Also, since you have no factors for infertility but still unable to conceive and if you have been trying for more than 2 years, I would suggest you to consider IVF.Follicular studies and timed intercourse will not help unexplained infertility and delay your goals.Also it is normal for some amount of sperm to come out.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"A couple of years ago I noticed that I have Gynocamastia and in 2015 I did a surgery but I didnt like the result and it didn t change a lot.

The egg is released 14 days prior to the next menses. Considering 24 hours' life of the egg and 72 hours' activity of the sperms, a period of about a week around the day of egg release is considered as Fertile window. However, it was a protected intercourse. How? I believe he must have used condom. Condom if used correctly has very good success rate. Just make  sure that it had not burst nor slipped during the intercourse. These common accidents lead to the possibility of pregnancy. Relax and expect your menses. Your menses are due on or around 13 November; so there is no reason for you to be anxious about pregnancy on 8 November. If your menses do not appear till 20 November, you may opt for urine pregnancy test. Done earlier, these tests may give false negative results. Beta hCG tests are more sensitive and specific which give reliable results within 2-3 days of missed period. You may opt for it also. I feel, you should not require any of these and will get your menses in due course. DR. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hey.

Now since you plan to go for pregnancy at the earliest, please discontinue the Depo injection from your next due date of injection; i.e. November. You should conceive within few months if there is no other problem. May be you will have to wait for a couple of months for the normalization of your hormonal cycles. Depo being a slow release progesterone, the exact period of complete waning of the hormonal effect may take some time. I hope this serves the purpose.

I would like to know if all your previous deliveries were normal or cesareans.Because if they were cesareans and the placenta was anterior, you may require further tests.

In my case, it s very hard to tell if I am or not. Reasoning b/c I usually have a menstrual every 3mths. However, the last menstrual was in Aug. My primary OBGYN has informed me that if I don t have a period with in 3mths that she would prescribe me medicine to make me have one. So November comes and I started to notice ONLY a brownish spotting which is very faint but still showing; which is known as Implanation Bleeding. Knowing that you can still ovulate w/o have a menstrual still is a chance of pregnancy. Other symptoms that I ve notice is, the Hot Flashes, Nausea but can t throw up, Abdominal Bloating, Mild Headaches, change in appetite, and frequent going to the bathroom. I took a pregnancy test which was negative but I believe that it was too early to detect the HGC hormonal levels. My question is, I ll be taking a blood test this Friday to get a more accurate result, but if that still comes up negative, what could case this?

Yes, women with irregular bleeding can be ovulating, but less likely than women with regular cycles, also the symptoms of bloating, hot flushes, nausea, point more towards menopausal vasomotor symptoms.Depending on your age, I would say you are probably perimenopausal. It is termed premature menopause if your age is less than 40.I would advise you to do FSH levels in blood, to know if you are menopausal or not.As if you are then, hormone replacement therapy would be treatment advisable to you.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"hi , im 5 weeks and 3 days pregnant . i had sore breasts in the begining of 4th week but now its completely gone . also i dont see any sign of pregnancy symptom and yesterday i had cramps around my left abdomen and lower abdomen. could this be a sign that my baby stopped growing","Doctor":"Hi,At 5-6 weeks its too early to say anything.Please get an ultrasound done to know the size and location of pregnancy.After 6 weeks the fetal heart is usually visible and if visible is very reassuring.Mild cramps and aches are common in early pregnancy, bleeding is a sign you have to be cautious about.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"My wife started taking folic acid from august20th. setp10th we tried for baby and we were successful.she is almost 2months pregnant now. i read somewhere that folic acid should be taken beforehand to prevent neural defects. what are the chances my baby has not suffered from those defects. first scan has showed its a twin. should we take 5mg or 10mg ?","Doctor":"Hi,Folic acid supplements are given to prevent defects in the baby's spine and brain from 3 months before conception to 12 weeks of pregnancy. Brain and spine development takes place between 25 to 35 days of life approximately which is the critical period when adequate folic acid should be available. Since your wife had taken folic acid before she conceived, it is very unlikely for you to have a neural tube defect in your babies.Also neural tube defects are more common in women with previous babies with neural tube defects, women who are diabetic, epileptic and who have certain enzyme deficiencies.Usual dose of folic acid is 400 micrograms only.In women with higher risk like diabetics, epileptics previous babies with defects, or women with twins we give 5 mg.10mg is not advisable.Hope this helps .Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi I need help determining my babys father!

I wish you best of luck ahead.Zanocin (Ofloxacin) is an antibiotic and is categorized as Pregnancy Class C drug meaning that we can use it if benefits outweigh the risks associated. It should be taken under supervision of a Physician.

I have taken 8 tests over the past week and all of them have been positive. I also have pcos and am on clomid. My appt. With my doctor is Friday. I am just worried about ovarian cysts and false positive pregnancy tests. Is it possible that this is what is going on?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,The urine pregnancy tests  detect the raised levels of a hormone hCG which is produced by a tissue called as Chorionic tissue. This belongs to the baby. If during your treatment you are not receiving any hCG preparation, the positive tests do indicate pregnancy. The incidence of false negative tests is known in earlier period; however, the incidence of false positive results, that too 8 times is highly unusual. Now that it is more than a week that your tests are showing positive results, I would recommend you to get ultrasonography done which will give you direct visual evidence of the status of your pregnancy. I hope this should get rid of your dilemma about your pregnancy. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I am late for my period and my body feels very hot.

Usually, PCOS (Polycystic ovarian syndrome is associated with infertility due to failure of egg release (ovulation). However, since you were on the treatment, it is likely that you might have ovulated and have become pregnant. Missing a period, which is the first cardinal symptom of pregnancy also may misguide in your case. In PCOS also, there is delay in menses, many a times for few months also. I would recommend you to get the confirmation of your status of pregnancy by hCG test. At this stage, Beta hCG test will be quite useful to you. This is a very specific and sensitive test and gives reliable results within 2-3 days of missed period, or even before that. I hope this will solve your dilemma.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I just started the neuvaring this month, but before starting it me and my boyfriend had unprotected sex.

We have been trying for a year now and I just don t want to get my hopes up. What could this be? I have never missed or been late on a period unless I was pregnant.","Doctor":"Hello,Home pregnancy tests should be done 3-7 days after the missed period with a fresh early morning sample of urine. You did not perform the test in the proper way and hence, please repeat it as suggested after a couple of days. You can also get an assessment of the serum beta-hCG titres for an earlier and better clarification. A trans-vaginal sonogram can be done one week after the missed period to know the status of the pelvic organs. Based on your history of perfectly regular cycles, your chances of pregnancy are high.

With a normal healthy pregnancy, serum beta-hCG titres should double every 2-3 days. Even if the fetal pole is not visible in an early sonogram, it may become visible later. This can happen with defective visualizations, inexperienced sonologist, miscalculated dates and delayed ovulation and conception. Repeat the sonogram along with serial titres of serum beta-hCG and if there is no positive response, go for an abortion. at this stage, surgical evacuation is ideal. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Well I am a pregnant woman in her 2nd trimester and I have a cold, and I cant stop coughing. I have taken Tussin and Dimetapp at the same time and it does not work.

The fact that you did not feel any impulse suggests that perhaps you did not receive any electric shock. There is no harm done in the current scenario to your pregnancy and so, please do not worry. It is also true at the same time that higher amounts of shock can lead to numbness, loss of function, loss of consciousness and threaten the pregnancy.

Please type your query here...dear sir, i am 6 weeks pregnant with occassional green discharge streaked with blood which i belive is from my cervical erosion. the problem is i lost my last baby at 20 weeks due to chorioamnionits with strep b, staphaureus, ecoli colonisation on the high vaginal swab and on the placenta post mortem. I continue to be a strep b carrier and am terrified that this green cervicla erosion discharge is the perfect medium for a repeat episode of chrioamnionitis. my obsterician says statistically i am no more at risk than the next woman despite my history and that he will treat the strep b at 14 weeks although it will probably recolinise itself within weeks of treatment. Is there any thing more that can be done? I wish i had , had the erosion cauterised prior to pregnancy although it didnt affect my first pregnancy at all and i have a healthy 3.5 year old daughter. any advise would be greatly appreciated,","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood your concern. It is very unfortunate to have lost the pregnancy. Your obstetrician is the better judge in this matter though I would suggest a vaginal and cervical swab  along with urinalysis to detect the cause of this discharge. Vaginal applications may be used with caution if needed though oral treatment is not prescribed for fungal or Trichomonial infections at this stage of pregnancy. Your past infection need not necessarily recur. Yet, you should be watchful. Please maintain proper genital hygiene and avoid intercourse. Drink plenty of water. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"hello doctor, this is Priya me and my husband are married since 3 years now,and we havnt had actual intercoure till date as my husband ejaculates very soon..now we are planning for baby soon and we went to some doctors but no use .. i m feeling to go for IUI artificial insemination ..what u suggest and is it safe to go for it ? how many days it would take ?","Doctor":"Hello Ms. Priya,Premature ejaculation can be treated after a proper evaluation to look into the specific causes. Relaxation techniques, use of condoms to reduce the sensation over the penis, altering the posture during the intercourse such as lying on the back etc., can be tried. IUI can be tried if natural methods fail after trying seriously to get pregnant for six months. It is a single sitting outpatient procedure, done on the day of ovulation with a concentrated sample. Ovulation inducing medications may be used prior to this and hence, multiple pregnancy is a possibility. There is also a slight chance of infection. The success rate can be up to 20 percent in a single cycle. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I am 22 my husband and I are trying to get pregnant, according to an online ovulation calculator i was most fertile Oct 31 which we tried, yesterday my husband and i noticed visilby blue veins running down the top of my breasts and circling my nipples.  I am still two weeks away from my period.  Is it too soon to know if I'm pregnant?  Too soon to test.  What else could be causing these symptoms.  I am also experiencing some tenderness in my breasts lower ab cramps and back cramps. Thank you","Doctor":"Hello,Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next menstrual period in usual circumstances. The influence of the hormones can be seen as engorged breasts, tenderness, bluish discoloration around the nipples, cramping dull pains in the lower abdomen as the ovum is released and traverses the fallopian tube. Unless you have been noting down the basal body temperature from day one of your cycle which shows a mid-cycle surge following ovulation which persists if conception has occurred, it is too early to test. You need to wait t least until a week after ovulation to get the blood test for pregnancy done. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi I gave birth on July 3rd, after healing from the stitches I got my period, from then I was given some microlut pills I missed two but I saw my period on august when i saw my period he used a condom.But last month I didn t see my period and I didn t miss a tablet and he ejaculated in me.

I got pregnant 5 months back but we had to abort it as it was not fully formed. Only sac was there. We started trying again 2 months back, but still I am not pregnant.

So, it should not concern you much, as it has happened only once.Since you have been trying again for only two months now, I would advise you to continue trying for another 8-10 months months.85% of couples conceive within a year of trying. Only the remaining 15% need help.

And I am telling you, this is the most important and inevitable task you both need right now.Why?we have to see fetus growth, any anomaly, presentation of the baby in uterus, length (CR) of fetus and a lot more aspects of pregnancy. Outcome of the delivery depends mainly on prenatal are. If fetus has head upside (called breech Presentation of fetus) that is difficult, complicated and risky to deliver normally through vagina. We have to go for a C-Section surgery for that delivery. Your prenatal visit is important as this will also decide the outcome of delivery. We will also be able to see the fetal growth.I have operated on many women who had this issue of exaggerated fetal movements and the reason being Umbilical Cord was so long that it was twisted around the neck of fetus. Fetus then moves a lot near term with entangled cord.Hope it was all needed to be answered for.

Smoking reduces the blood supply to the placenta and thus the growth of the baby is affected.

He said my hormone level was at 200.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,You have two aims in front of you:1. To find out whether you are pregnant or not: If the hCG levels are unable to detect your pregnancy, you may have to rely on the ultrasonography views. If abdominal ultrasonography vision is obliterated by the dermoid cyst, you may opt for ultrasonography by probe in the vagina or rectum. Probably after few days, the picture may be more suggestive. 2. Take a decision about what is to be done with the dermoid cyst. The advice depends upon the site and size of the cyst. Your Obstetrician is the best adviser for this since he knows these details. Now-a-days, such cysts can be dealt Laparoscopically even during the pregnancy.

I was not always over weight actually I was very small as a child sickly they used to say. I had a lot of ear nose and throat problems corrected with surgery (tonsils and adnoids removed) when I was 7. They doctor said he removed more infection out of me than any other patient he had seen. After surgery I started to gain weight and when I was 11 I started having my period. After my first, 6 weeks later I got punched in the stomach and started my period again. When I was 14 I started to walk and exercise a lot so much that my periods stopped coming for 4 months. I was at a healthy 140 pounds till when I was 16 and I started working 35 plus hours a week, getting good grades in school, and started dating. I became sexually active at 16 as well. The first time I had sex I did not bleed at all. All the while my periods were very irregular coming ever 4-8 weeks. I contributed this to stress. I got put on the depo shot at 17 and gained 35 pounds fast (in about 3 months). I did not go back and get another shot or get put on any other birth control. I was still seeing the same man (who is now my husband). Over the years I just keep gaining pound after pound. I stopped exercising when I got a job because I never had the time. I quit that job when I was 17 and just focused on school (my grades dropped to a B/C average). To tell you the truth I never monitored my menstrual cycles the way that I should. I do keep a lot of stress in my life and always have and everyone always told me that that is why my periods are the way that they are. I split from my boyfriend after high school and was sexually active with two other men one of which I used protection (condoms) and the other I didn t. I was living with my sister and our cycles seemed to start becoming regular together. She was trying to get pregnant and one time she told me she got her period and I thought it was odd that I had not gotten mine. So I took a pregnancy test and it came back negative. What my sister thought was her period later she found out was implantation bleeding (She had a sucessful birth to a beautiful little girl). I started my period two weeks later. I actually went back to the boyfriend that I had had since I was 16 and got married a couple months later at age 18. I kept a lot of stress then because we were on our own and not really doing as well as I would hoped. We did not eat regular at all and I was under a lot of stress. But despite that my periods came about every 6 or so weeks. I thought was normal. I went for a pap in 06 and got put on the pill 10 months later (me and my husband always used protection everytime) My pap was normal I did not have any diseases or anything. My periods always came during the sugar pill week (it usually took 2 or 3 days) but they came and ended either before, on, or after the day I went back on the actual pill. I went back for another pap in 07 a year later everything came back normal my periods were still doing what was stated above. The next year I went for a pap in 08 and told them I may have a yeast infection and the prescribed Diflucan (which I was allergic to). Within a week I got a call that I had Trichomoniasis? I think that is how you spell it? Anyways it was very odd because I had no other sex partners and to tell you the truth I can almost gaurantee my husband did not have any either. I went got a prescription filled it and me and my husband took it as prescribed. I was also put on effexor XR for depression that year by another doctor.. They also changed my pill that year as well. I can honestly say that the changed it from a combination pill to just a one hormonal pill (or maybe the other way around) I am sorry I can not remember the name. The next year (n 09) I back I had gotten up to 240 pounds, I had headaches everyday for a year, and was taking a lot of tylenol. The took me off the birth control they though it was too much. Well that is when me and my husband decided that it was time to try for a baby. I started doing a high fiber, no eating after 7, no pop, lot of water diet. It worked great. But because of family issues (sister was now a drug addict) I had to start taking care of my neice and stayed with my mom a couple days out of the week. Sress levels became very high. I went to a therapist when I stopped taking the effexor medication and the decided to put me on Lamictal which within 3 months they had to replace with seraquel. That only lasted 2 weeks. I slept all the time and I could not care for my neice. All the while after being taken off of birth control me and my husband had been trying to conceive. My periods were every 2 months now. I kept taking HPT and they were always negative. So I actually gave up hope. We talked about quitting but when the time came to put a condom on we never did. In October of 09 My sister had gotten into a lot of trouble. Me and her had some words and then she left. Well my husband was actually going to get a pregnancy test on his way home that night because he had noticed some changes in me ? I dont know his words not mine LOL. Well I tried to relax and rest when I got a horrible sharp pain in my back (I never used to get sharp pains before my period not like this) and almost started immediatly. I called my husband and told him to not worry about bringing home a test because I had started my period. I bled for 10 days. I never bled for anything over 5 days before. I also had a lot of stringy blood but never passed anything. Within a month I started getting lower left abdominal pains that would go into my back and down my leg. I had started going to school online and I thought well this is because I am at the computer all the time. Well it was now November and I got a double ear infection and strep throat. I was prescribed amox/clav 800 mg. They did not do a pregnancy test because I told them there was no way I was pregnant. (me and my husband actually had stopped having sex since the incident). Well me and my husband had a very great conversation and started trying again at the begining of December. I was laid up for a week while I had the infection and finished my antibiotics. My hip pain kept coming. Judging by a different pain in my abdominal area and the discharge I was having December the 23 we immediatley had sex. I also had a mild cold for 3 days all through Christmas then. I was for sure to have orgasms afterwards (to help the sperm) every time we had sex. Well when I realized I had not had my pap I made an appointment January 4th. I took 3 pregnancy tests and they all came back negative. I went to the appointment as schelduled and got a pap where she was having trouble reaching my cervix. She said it was pointing down? I dont know what that means? Anyways I had told her of everything that was going on. She gave me a pregnancy test and it came up negative. Then She said I may have PCOS? She told me of the symptoms and there is only two things that maybe what she thinks that it could have been. I am overweight and I keep it on my stomach. I am not hairy my voice is high pitched and I do not have a lot of hair in places they should not be. I have one hair on my left breast. I do have hair (I am black headed) and the hair besides on my privates and my legs are blonde (you cant see them unless you are really close). My blood sugar came back low-normal 87 at the appoinment. They did not do any blood test. She ordered me a pelvic ultra sound. I am wondering if this was handled the right way? I go for the pelvic ultrasound next monday. I am wondering if you have any thoughts about what may be the problem. I still have the lower left abdominal pain. I have recently cut out all soda (pop) from my diet I drank water all day long maybe have a glass of milk every now and then. I try to eat as much fruits and vegatables as I can. I am taking prenatal vitamins since the appointment 4 days ago. I really am just wondering why she order the pelvic exam and if there is any way to get my period back. Does it sound like it is all stress related? Could the medicine/sickness through me off? Any help of advice would be excellent. I really dont think I have PCOS. Thank you in advance.","Doctor":"DearRead your history thoroughly .In my opinion your dr. wants to rule out any pathology in pelvis , so asked you to get the scan done.You are overweight and your periods are irregular , one of the signs of PCOS.Relax, there is a treatment for PCOS, if your scan shows it.Take careDr.Mira Butani"},{"Patient":"I am worried about adult fungal infection transmitted to my future newborn baby. I have 2 sisters who will be helping to take care of the baby during my confinement, however, both of them are suffering from fungal infections for more than 12 months. The younger sister, the skin on her forehead was very dark, but now it has lightened up, however, there s a new infection on her knee. The infection gives light itches. The older sister is also suffering from something similiar, in between her neck and shoulder. I was also suffering from redness on my scalp which causes itchiness. I was prescribed a shampoo, the redness is gone, however the itchiness is still there and my hair now easily falls everywhere, even when I comb and especially when I shampoo, my hand will be filled with hair. I ve stopped using the prescribed shampoo and use an over the counter anti fungal cream, it reduced the itchiness, but I am still suffering from hair loss.

Prolonged use can lead to birth defects. Use in the later stages of pregnancy can lead to placental abruption, preterm birth and fetal death.

Yes---you may become pregnant in near future. I wish the best of times ahead for you.Healthiest Regards!Dr. Sumaira Kousar MD"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, I am a case of primary infertility.

For this a fetal 2D ECHO(special ultrasound) is required for monitoring of the baby.Generally if your depression is under control then cognitive behavioral therapy sessions with your psychiatrist can be given and the drug gradually tapered.But in most patients it is safer to continue the drug and prevent depressive attacks in pregnancy.Also you may have postpartum depression which needs to be looked for.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"hello there! i am 15weeks pregnant and i had a brown discharge spot last night after I passed stool.

Your US report suggests  -      - early conception, in your previous cycle  with  a blighted ovum.( a chemical pregnancy.. without formation of fetus so there is no fetal pole ) Such pregnancies usually automaticallyterminate / need termination done.

Causes for irregular periods can be PCOD/ ovarian problems/ thyroid problems/ pituitary problems/ sever anemia/ obesity, diabetes.    Before trying to conceive, you should consult a gynecologist/ endocrinologist  along with relevant investigations .. to ascertain definite cause of irregular menses. Get it specifically treated  get your husband also investigated to exclude any problem.      From your history you seem to have either PCOD or Thyroid problem.  They are managed well with specific treatment.& planning after that would be fruitful!

Thank you for your time.","Doctor":"HI,   I understand your concern.   Actually it is desired to get rid of all the possible causes for the mishap & have 3 normal cycles before next conception.

Termination at 7 months is just like a miniature delivery. So resuming normal ovulatory cycles may take few months. In addition your physical & psychological well being plays essential part in conception.     I feel not the fertility specialists, but you can consult a gynecologist for your general check up/ your ovulation study. You should ascertain all the factors to be normal/ have a perfect health with good Hb% & no illness ( both of you )-- have medication for getting good ovulating cycles ( if needed).. & the plan for a baby.

THe green urine in your daughter's case can be-    - Leaking of amniotic fluid having green tinge.. being mistaken for green urine Green amniotic fluid suggests fetal distress.. The differentiating point is .. the green discharge of amniotic fluid increases on coughing.    - It can be urine infection as guessed by hospital people,  urine infection being risky in pregnancy, must be controlled soon.  The differentiating point would be-        - burning, pain, increased frequency  while urination,          -routine & microscopic examination of urine.  *  so whatever the cause be, an urgent evaluation of the case is is essential with help of a gynecologist.

Ejaculate is a mixture of sperm from testis that flows through the vas deference, prostate fluid and seminal fluid. Seminal fluids are propelled through the contractors muscles present in it which stores and releases semen, due to the years of masturbation your contractory muscles might have been weakens, since the seminal vesicle is placed close to the rectum, when you force to defecate yours seminal fluid is leaking. I suggest you to just allow your body to heal itself. Just stop masturbating, eat healthy diet including fruits,vegetables and proteins. It's better to indulge in aerobic exercises. These things will increase the antioxidant levels, blood supply to the required organs to heal and get restored by itself.

If the sonogram performed was through the trans-vaginal route and if your sonographer is an experienced person, it is likely that you may have miscarried, provided you have regular cycles and did not miscalculate. When this is not so, it is better to wait and see. In such a scenario, serial titres of serum beta-hCG are often done. Good progress of pregnancy is indicated by doubling of titres every 2-3 days.

It is not the absolute value of the hormone that is important, but the amount of rise. If there is an initial drop followed by a steep rise, a molar pregnancy should also be suspected. A trans-vaginal sonogram should be performed at weekly intervals until clarification is obtained. This should be correlated clinically.

You can try little amounts of what you used to consume earlier and if you do not find any discomfort, go for it. If you have a doubt that you may have become allergic or may develop an allergic reaction, you should avoid taking fish; you can take mineral supplements instead.

The bleeding is usually fresh and sometimes mimics a period, as you mentioned in your history. The best way to know is to get an estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres since you are at least 7 days past your ovulation day and if conception had occurred, this would show up in the test.

The severe pain started yesterday, and it is not constant. One minute the pain, on a scale of 1-10, is about a 2 or 3. The next minute, the pain is about an 8 or 9.

If you have not missed your period, you need not be concerned about possibility of pregnancy.However, you had just a spot bleeding for the last menses. This can be suggestive of pregnancy. During pregnancy, the other symptoms to show are nausea & vomiting with altered taste, frequent urination and breast changes which include engorgement with tenderness, dark discolouration of nipples and areola with increase in areolar size and secretions through nipples. However these symptoms appear after 6 weeks of pregnancy. You can get urine tested for pregnancy 8 days after the incidence to spotting. Earlier these tests may give false negative results. However, Beta hCG tests are more specific and sensitive which can give you reliable results within 2-3 days of missed period. You may go for this test. During pregnancy, there is increased mucous discharge due to increased levels of Oestrogen hormone. However, this discharge is without any symptoms.

A false positive test can be seen in conditions where external hCG supplements have been used as in the treatment for infertility. Since you have had persistent positive pregnancy tests, the next step should be to get a trans-vaginal sonogram to confirm the pregnancy, locate the gestation sac and also to note the age of the pregnancy.

It is obvious that you are pregnant for the first time. Painless labor is a procedure being followed now-a-days in several clinics and this involves slow and sustained release of low doses of medication through an epidural catheter. This helps one to tide over the process of labor without experiencing any pain. Prenatal yoga and exercises also help to manage labor easily. So, just relax and do not worry.

What does/could this mean??","Doctor":"Hi,During pregnancy the blood supply to the vagina increases and this could make the usually pink vaginal vault to look purplish or blackish. So do not worry. It will go back to its non pregnancy state by 6 weeks after delivery.This is usually due to the effects of progesterone hormone effects on blood vessels.For the itchiness, get a high vaginal swab done by a Gynaecologist / midwife, if it shows any bacterial or fungal infection it has to be treated.Do you have any burning during passing urine, if yes it could be a urine infection, which will need to be treated.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello, me and my husband are wanting to get pregnant.

I can guess two possibilities in your case..    - May it was incomplete abortion & remaining products of conception are being expelled out, that's why pain low down along with bleeding in day time. Now as the products are coming out of vagina vagina seems to be protruding out, giving impression of swelling.   - Another possibility is infection after abortion.

To have at least 8 hours good sleep is essential in pregnancy.

In the night, put the lights off, do not play,nor encourage her to play. Try to sleep silently by her side. The child will try to cry/ shout to draw your attention .. do not respond. Ultimately, the child will play alone for some time & fall asleep.

Though only one sperm is required to fertilize the ovum, it has to travel up to the egg. Lower the percentage of good motile sperms, lesser are the chances of conception. Your good motile sperms are hardly 5%; hence the pregnancy cannot be guaranteed though not impossible. I feel you may choose one of the following options if natural conception fails:1. Intra Uterine Insemination : The sperms after capacitation are directly instilled into the uterine cavity2. Intra Cellular Sperms Injection : The healthy single sperm is injected in to the ovum. 3. In Vitro Fertilization : The egg fertilized outside the body and then is instilled in to the uterine cavity. I feel one of the first two should be appropriate for you if natural fertilization fails.

Your logic for negative urine tests sounds very correct. These tests done too early, before 8 days of missed period, are likely to give false negative results. Beta hCG tests are more specific and sensitive. These tests give reliable results within 2-3 days of missed period, sometimes even before missing a period.

The medicines given to you  can be given in pregnancy in certain conditions ...  when their  benefit is greater tahn it's side effects.        - Duphaston is an essential hormone needed for maintenance of pregnancy. It is very safe in pregnancy.      -Progynova , has low hormonal content.. which is not observed to cause side effects on fetus. So it can be given ( while careful monitoring pregnancy ).. in case of hypogonadism.Or in cases of embryo transfer.    - Bromocryptin is given specially in cases of hypo gonadism ( low hormonal levels ) .. due to pitutary problems . It can be given safely with due care in such condition.   - Folic acid is a vitamin which prevents fetal malformations ( spinal abnormalities)   I hope you are convinced about safety of the drugs .. specially these being prescribed by your doctor( who is well versed with your health & problems ).

The egg is usually released 14 days prior to the next expected menses. However, you are having PCOS and had menses following Novelon; hence it is difficult to predict the day of egg release (ovulation) in you. The best option for you is to monitor ovulation. You can do it either by Ovulation Monitoring Home Kit or by Ultrasonography. When the ovulation takes place, utilise that day for your sexual intercourse. This will increase the possibility of pregnancy. The egg is having life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. So try to have at least  every alternate day frequent intercourses  around the day of ovulation. If you are monitoring ovulation by ultrasonography, keep in mind that usually a healthy ovum is released when follicle is between 18 mm to 21 mm size. If the follicle is mature but ovulation does not take place naturally, the Gynaecologist may give you hCG injection to cause the ovulation. Then you should have intercourses. I hope this helps you.

I have been having mildly painful contractrions and have been extremely sick with flu-like symptoms (vomiting,headache,diarrhea) and all she says is drink water and bed rest.

If there is a gush of fluid that may be clear watery or blood tinged and there are contractions of uterus that you can feel in lower abdomen and pelvis then it will be known as the Water break and this is a sign off onset of delivery process.

I had sex with my boyfriend protectively on 16th and unprotected on the 18th. On the 20th I went to get the morning after pill and the nurse told me I was pregnant. I told a ultrasounds today and nothing is there. Am I pregrant? I need help!!!!","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,There is a lot of misconception.Firstly, if you had menses from 10th to 15th, 18th is the day 8 of your cycle. The fertile window usually lies between day 10 to day 20 of the cycle (see below). So the chances of becoming pregnant are very remote. Moreover, it is impossible for the nurse to diagnose a pregnancy on day 10 of the cycle after menses. The egg is yet to be released. The egg is released (ovulation) 14 days before the next expected menses. Egg lives for 24 hours and sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence a period of about 8 to 10 days around this day of ovulation is considered as Fertile window. So on 20th your ovulation also had not taken place. How can you become pregnant? No test for pregnancy will reveal pregnancy as it is not there. Please wait for the menses. If you have few more intercourse in the fertile window, you will have chances to conceive and then 8-10 days after the missed period, your urine test for pregnancy will detect it. Of course, Beta hCG tests can give reliable results within 2-3 days of missed period.

By 16 weeks, the uterus has risen midway between umbilicus and the bone at the lower part of abdomen at mount of Venus. If you palpate in the lower part of abdomen, you may feel a firmish counter there. If you cannot appreciate it, you may get it confirmed from any midwife, nurse or doctor. If there is any doubt, the best option is to go for ultrasonography. It will not only confirm the viability of the baby but also measure the duration of pregnancy and can estimate tentative expected date of delivery. Also it will evaluate by and large normalcy of the foetus. Hence, even if you can palpate the uterus per abdomen, I would advise you to go for a baseline ultrasonography scan.

Precum does contain some sperms which can impregnate a woman. Your intercourse was very much near fertile window which usually from day 10 to day 20 of a regular menstrual cycle of 28-30 days. Some spotting before missing a period is not a symptom of pregnancy. However, wait for her period. If she missed it, get urine tested for pregnancy 8-10 days after missed period. These tests may give false negative results if performed earlier. Beta hCG tests are more specific and sensitive; hence they can give reliable results within 2-3 days after missing a period. If she is pregnant and does not want this pregnancy, she can get it terminated by medicines by Obstetrician's prescription only.

Now with the nuchal scan and triple test, will it be sufficient that i will not have to do the amniocentesis which is a invasive procedure ? doc can you pls advice.","Doctor":"Hi,Amniocentesis is a definitive test and can tell for sure if the baby has Downs or not. If you are very anxious about Downs, it will be the investigation of choice for you, especially since now you are 15 weeks, you can go for amniocentesis at 16 weeks.The first trimester blood test, nuchal scan and the second trimester triple test are only screening tests, so even if the double marker at 11 weeks is 95% accurate it can just say the risk. A sure result can only be done by Amniocentesis at 16 weeks for you.But please also do remember that amniocentesis has a 1/100 risk of miscarriage, and you should be aware of this before undergoing the procedure.41 years in itself is a high risk for Down's , considering an amniocentesis could be beneficial to you.Please consult a good fetal medicine expert for the amniocentesis.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Me and my boyfriend had sex but he wore a condom. probably 5-10 minutes after he took it off and wiped off his penis we started again but he didn't finish because we stopped realizing we were getting carried away.

When the condom has broken during withdrawal, the sperms must have been spilt into the vagina. To avoid such accident, the tit of the condom should be pinched in fingers to expel the air within while putting it on. The trapped air leads to rupture of condom due to increased pressure inside the tit. You should take emergency birth control pill ideally within 24 hours but not later than 72 hours of this accident to protect you from the pregnancy.

Gestone which is Progesterone preparation stabilizes the pregnancy with Progesterone deficiency when the baby is still alive.

SHE IS ALSO FACING SAME PROBLEM OF JAMMING OF HER LEGS SINCE PREGNANCY","Doctor":"HI,   I understand your concern.   Swelling on hands & legs along with jamming  can be due to -    - Swelling itself/calcium deficiency/ joint  swelling.   Swelling on hands/ legs in pregnancy is many a times  normal due to water retention in pregnancy. growing pressure of uterus on blood vessels ( specially in later months) adds to the swelling. But the presence of swelling in pregnancy should never be taken lightly. It's safer to exclude -    - Severe anemia with low protein levels,   -  When there is puffiness of face ( swelling under eyes ) in morning along with swelling on legs/ hands.check for - Kidney infection ( with albumin in urine)/ high blood pressure. It can be hazardous for pregnancy.( Toxemia of pregnancy )   - Swelling on legs can be due to heart problems.   *Your wife needs through investigations & check up to find the cause of swelling & get needful treatment immediately.

I understand your concern.   Pain in abdomen in late month of pregnancy  can be due to-    - Mild contractions of uterus which move baby down in pelvic cavity.    - Constipation/ gasses due to disturbed digestion.    - Frequency of urination,which is normal at the late pregnancy, still infection has to be excluded as pain suggests infection.. which needs treatment    - Infection of vagina or pelvis needs to be excluded.   - Calcium/ vitamin D deficiency can cause such pain & is relieved after replacement.   * So you need a through check up with needful investigations  to exclude infection/ diagnose & get specific treatment.

He didnt ejaculate anything at all. the tip of him did go inside of me for about 2 seconds. He may or may not have had pre cum but his last ejaculation was about 5 days before this incident so from the research i've done there shouldnt be any sperm in the pre cum right? is there even a chance i could be pregnant?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,If any part of his penis has entered into your vagina, the chances of expulsion of precum into your vagina cannot be excluded. Precum do contain some sperms in it which are capable of swimming towards the ovum and cause pregnancy. So if your intercourse was in the fertile window, you have to take precaution by taking emergency contraceptive  within 24 hours but not later than 72 hours after the sexual intercourse. Egg release happens 14 days prior to next menses. Considering 24 hours' life of egg and 72 hours active sperms, a period of about one week around the day of egg release is considered as Fertile window. If you miss the period, get the urine tested for pregnancy after 8-10 days of missed period. Before that, the test may give false negative results. Beta hCG tests are more sensitive and specific which can give you reliable results within 2-3 days of missed period. I hope this helps you.

But, would these results affect the fetus ? or should i postpone pregnancy and take the drugs to lower it first ?","Doctor":"Hello, I hope I can help you today.The common medications which are used to lower cholesterol, called statins, are not safe to use during pregnancy. For one, cholesterol levels actually normally rise during pregnancy, because cholesterol is used to make a lot of the hormones and developing tissues, such as the brain, in the fetus. For that reason, many medical professionals do not recommend any woman of reproductive age to start using cholesterol-lowering medication. The other reason is that the chance at your age of your actually having a heart attack or stroke just from high cholesterol is still extremely low.At your age, the likelihood of your having problems conceiving are relatively low and the best way to have a healthy pregnancy is to be healthy before you get pregnant. So I recommend following your doctor's instructions regarding cholesterol-lowering medication, and delaying pregnancy until your cholesterol is under better control. In addition to medications there may be diet and exercise recommendations that your doctor may have which will put you in a better state of health then you are right now.So in summary, high cholesterol does not affect the fetus in any negative way, and the body actually makes more cholesterol during pregnancy to provide the fetus with nutrition. However cholesterol-lowering medication can actually harm the fetus by decreasing cholesterol levels to the point where the proper development of the fetus could be compromised.So in order to both keep the baby safe as well as improve your health I would recommend delaying pregnancy until after you've worked with your primary physician in order to lower your cholesterol and get your body into a healthier state to prepare for pregnancy. You should be off cholesterol-lowering medication at the time you are trying to conceive.In the long run, missing high cholesterol medication for about a year especially at your young age and if you do not have any other cardiac risk factors, will not do harm to you.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

The formula for calculating EDD is :EDD = LMP + 9 months + 7 days. So in your wife's case it come to 31st December.

Such bleeding in good old days was labelled as  Placental sign. Very few women get such blood. Since, you are experiencing only one day bleeding at the expected time of menses, your breasts have been engorged and you are experiencing nausea, the possibility of pregnancy cannot be ignored.  Moreover, you have missed your birth control pills for 3+ days. The chances of pregnancy are very high. You should get the pregnancy confirmed. Please get your urine tested for pregnancy. Also you may get ultrasonography done which will give a direct visual evidence of pregnancy. After 8 weeks, the clinical examination also gives reliable evidence of pregnancy. If you do not want to continue with this pregnancy (if it is present) you may opt for Termination of pregnancy by medicines which is quite safe and successful up to 9 weeks of pregnancy.

Thanks in advance!","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy or morning sickness is a notorious part of the pregnancy. Please try to observe following:1. Let her not cook the food. In fact she should keep away when the food is being cooked. 2. Let her eat dry food. Liquid food regurgitates easily. have short but frequent feeds. 3. Eat only what she likes and feels like eating.4. Avoid oily and spicy food. 5. Avoid tea/coffee. Buttermilk is a good drink. Particularly in the morning when nausea is more. 6. She may have more liking for sour items. Let her have them. 7. By this vomiting can be avoided, however, nausea cannot be conquered by any means. However, my experience with the patients for over 40 years  has shown me that banana or melon with plenty of sugar in cold water takes away the nausea due to any reason. 8. If persistent vomiting makes her dehydrated, take her to the hospital. She may need IV fluids lest it becomes a vicious circle. Dehydration can be adjudged by pinching skin on the back of the hand. If the fold remains, she is dehydrated. There are many medicines which stop vomiting; however, some of them have ill effects on baby in the womb. So as far as possible, try to control it by modifying eating habits. If still vomiting cannot be controlled, please visit an Obstetrician and take medicines with his/her advice only. As it is nausea and vomiting of pregnancy lasts only till 12 weeks of pregnancy. So within 3 weeks, she will be relieved of it. If she can pull on with it without medicines, great.

In fact it is a very good digestive food and should be consumed during pregnancy. Urine pregnancy tests are reliable after about 8-10 days of pregnancy. You may repeat the test after a couple of days. Still if it shows negative results, you have following options:1. Beta hCG tests are very specific and sensitive tests. You may try it. 2. By this time ultrasonography will give you direct visual evidence of the status of pregnancy. If you are pregnant and do not want to continue pregnancy, there are simpler, safer and easier ways to terminate the pregnancy. Mifepristone and Misoprostol are the two medicines taken in combination is a good, reliable and safe method to terminate the pregnancy up to 9 weeks of gestation. However these are not 'over the counter' medicines and need to be taken only with a Gynaecologist's advice and prescription.

Delay in or missing a period cannot be relied upon to suspect pregnancy. Urine pregnancy test and/or ultrasonography may help to confirm the status of pregnancy. If there is no pregnancy, I would advise you to get your hormonal work up (FSH, LH, Prolactine, T3, T4, TSH) done to evaluate the cause of irregular menses. Ultrasonography also would be a good tool to look for Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. Do not just ignore your irregular menses. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"hi, if i m doing the hcg injections (for 2 days) and got a blood pregnancy test and it came back positive with an 8, would that just be the injections giving it a positive result or am i really pregnant? i have had very tender breasts for about 5 days and had sex a day before i was supposed to ovulate. i should be starting my period on Monday.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,If you are hCG, it is better to confirm the pregnancy by ultrasonography as external hCG may misguide the urine pregnancy test. You history of intercourse around the day of ovulation and heavy tender breasts with positive urine pregnancy test is suggestive of pregnancy; however, confirm by scan. All the best,Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"okay i took a home pregnancy test 5 days before i am supposed to get my period and it came out positive so my fiancée told his parents and i told mine. My mother made me a dr s appointment but its a month away, and she keeps saying that its probably a false positive. what do you think? positive or false?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Many of the new, over-the-counter pregnancy tests are so sensitive that they can detect pregnancy hormone even before a missed menstrual cycle.So if you perform the test correctly, and interpret the results correctly, it is unlikely to be a false positive. However, the reason OB/GYN's do not usually recommend testing before you have actually missed a menstrual cycle is that sometimes a fertilized egg can temporarily make pregnancy hormone and then not implant which can result in a positive pregnancy test and a and then a normal or slightly late period This is called a chemical pregnancy and can get you excited about being pregnant and then disappointed.So, I would just stop drinking alcohol, take prenatal vitamins, and possibly repeat the test after you miss your menstrual cycle.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this advice was helpful.Best wishes, and good luck with the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"on 24th jan 2011 i got married & got my periods on 27th of Jan 2011 but next month i do not got my periods so i tested home test the test confirmed iam pregnancy then after on 10th of march 2011 i got periods then i consult doctor they said that my pregnanancy got aboson then doctor ask me to take novelon tablets as per doctor instruction i had taken tablet from 17th march 2011 but within 8days i got periods but flow of periods is 5- 6drops its dangerous?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,You had abortion. When the abortion is in threatened phase of abortion, i.e. the baby is still viable with threat to pregnancy, attempts can be made to arrest the process of abortion. However, it seems that your baby was already non-viable; hence the process of abortion could not be arrested by the medicines doctors gave you.  What you feel you got period was in fact starting the process of abortion. It is better if you confirm the diagnosis by ultrasonography as urine pregnancy test requires about a week to ten days to become negative. If ultrasonography reveals that this is incomplete or missed abortion, better get it completed by surgical evacuation. If still the baby is viable, continuation of Novalon tablets might help you to stabilise the pregnancy. I hope this serves the purpose."},{"Patient":"hi respected sir i want 2 ask u that i m not getting the real time the month of my pregnancy ... i missed my periods on 26 jan then my urine was negitive whole month i kept on trying checking my urine then on 27 feb my urine came positive .... so on 16 march i visited a doctor she was confused as she could not see fetous so kindly guide me month jan i just missed my period due other reason ... and pregnancy occured after 25 jan and on 27 feb my month was completed so urine was positive ....thank u","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,the main question is whether you are pregnant or not! Your pregnancy tests are negative, your doctor could not locate the foetus (by which method?). On what grounds are you presuming that you are pregnant?My advice is to get ultrasonography done. It will help you to diagnose the status of your pregnay, assess its gestational age and help you to calculate the due date of delivery. If ultrasonography shows that you are not pregnant, then the cause of your delayed period will have to be investigated. Reproductory hormonal imbalance, Thyroid dysfunction, etc. may cause menstrual irregularity. You will need a thorough work up if you are not pregnant. If you are pregnant, ultrasonography will help you decide the due date of parturition. Otherwise, the simplest formula to calculate due date is date of last menstrual period + 9 months + 7 days.I hope this serves your purpose.Dr. Nishikant Shrotr"},{"Patient":"I am 9 weeks pregnant and have been having mild cramping for the past few days.

So there is a possibility that everything is completely fine and normal for your pregnancy. However, if you have not yet had an ultrasound to confirm that the pregnancy is developing normally and that the fetus has a heartbeat, I suggest you do so because vaginal bleeding can be a symptom of an abnormal pregnancy or impending miscarriage. However if you've had a recent ultrasound examination showed that the fetus was doing fine white vaginally bleeding usually will resolve itself by the end of the first trimester (12 weeks).I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.

It is not unusual for women to have some bleeding 2 to 3 days after taking the morning-after pill. This is not a real menstrual cycle, just evidence that the medication is working. Her real cycle may be delayed as a side effect of the hormones in the medication.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring.Best wishes and good luck,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Is there another way to determine a pregnancy test without going in to a clinic?

Currently, medically uninsured.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.An over-the-counter, home pregnancy test is over 99% accurate when performed correctly after a missed menstrual cycle.Therefore, you really do not need to see a physician to confirm the negative pregnancy test, as the ones in the doctor's office are just as accurate.Your uterus does not enlarge the level you can actually feel it abdominally until you are at least 3 to 4 months gestation. So if you are feeling an abdominal bulge, this is definitely not due to pregnancy. There are other things that may be gynecologic that can enlarge your uterus, and a GYN doctor would be able to diagnose these problems. However, in your case, if you feel a bulge in your upper abdomen, there is a possibility that your intestines can also be a source of the bulge you feel.So in summary, I think you can count on the result of your pregnancy test but if at all possible, it would be helpful to get a medical physical from a general physician to make sure that there isn't anything concerning going on.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"my cheeks are really red, almost like there is a rash on them? i read an article about this on a website and it said this could be a sign of pregnancy. i have also been having clear/white jelly like discharge for about 5 days now. any ideas on whats going on?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.If you are having unprotected intercourse and not using contraception, there is always a risk of pregnancy. However pregnancy symptoms can vary widely between women, and the most common sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual cycle.In addition, the character and amount of your vaginal discharge varies normally with your ovulatory cycle. I do not know the first day of your last period, however in the first 7 to 14 days of your cycle is normal to have clear or white discharge that can become very thin and runny at the time of ovulation, and then gets thicker as you approach your next menstrual cycle. As long as you're vaginally discharge does not have a strong odor or itch, it is likely normal and just due to normal hormonal changes.Furthermore, what causes the \\"glow\\" of your face during pregnancy is increase blood flow to your head and face, which is why many pregnant women get frequent headaches. It is not a universal symptom of pregnancy, and if you have not yet missed a period, there is no way your face rash is due to pregnancy.

Lupron also interacts with many drugs so keep your treating doctor informed about all the medications & other supplements you take so that the doses can be monitored accordingly or other medications can be given to help you get comfortable. Radiation therapy often results in Neurotoxicity. Neurotoxicity may affect the central or the peripheral nervous system which causes symptoms like trembling, fatigue & weakness of the limbs.

Paragraph things you can do to help minimize the chance of complications at your delivery is to take an iron supplement in addition to your prenatal vitamin, to ensure that you are not anemic at delivery.It would also be a good idea to deliver in a hospital who has access to blood transfusion and emergency procedures for postpartum hemorrhage, rather than in a birthing center or somewhere without immediate access to emergency medical care.It would be in your doctors best interest as well to have medication readily available that can be used to treat postpartum hemorrhage; Misoprostil is the one most commonly usedSo in summary, you have a high likelihood of another postpartum hemorrhage because of your obstetric history.If you deliver in proper healthcare facility, and do your best to not be anemic at delivery, the greatest chance is that you still will have a healthy pregnancy and delivery.I hope I was adequately able to answer your questions today, and that my advice was reassuring.Best wishes, and good luck with the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"hi i came off the depo in october (thats wen my next injection was due) and i bled for about a week then stopped for a few day n then bleeding again etc..... i stopped bleeding around 18th december and havent bled since but i have had sex without contraception and now i have really sore and tender breasts and nipples is this from coming off the depo side effects or could i be pregnant i thought it would be too early to get pregnant after coming off the depo? please help thanks, becky","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Theoretically, you can become pregnant even if you are one day late for your next Depo injection.However, it usually takes 3 to 6 months to resume your normal menstrual  cycle.

As your uterus grows, there are two ligaments that are located on either side of the graph the front wall of your uterus that anchor it to your pelvis. These are called the round ligaments and for some reason, many women experience pulling sensations and pain as these ligaments are stretched. The pain is usually associated with walking or standing, and for an unknown reason, is more likely to occur on the right side.We refer to that type of pain in obstetrics as round ligament pain. It usually begins in the mid-second trimester and can occur into the early third trimester. It is nothing to worry about and usually will go away when you rest or drink lots of water as the nurse advised.If you experience any vaginal bleeding, or leakage of watery fluid from the vagina, or regular painful abdominal pains that seem to come and go with the clock and feel like menstrual cramps, you should instead report to labor and delivery for further evaluation.In the meantime however the right-sided pain you describe is likely a normal part of pregnancy, and really is nothing to worry about.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring.Best wishes, and best of luck for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Im 13 and im a virgin never been near a boys gentials and ive never kissed a bo, but i don't know why i got paranoied about being pregnant, when ever i think about it i feal faint and really scared. i got my period in june or july this year. scince we started school again my period was always 21 -23 days apart and im supposed to be getting me period tomorrow beacuse that would be 28 days from the last one but im not sure i will because its been a longer space scince i started, im really scared im pregnant i always check my belly in the mirror, it would be really easy to see if i have a bump because im quite underweight so any weight gain is easy to spot, i've been scared and stressed because of this and that might be why im late with my period but i really need someone to assure me its all in my head. i've also never been a girl with many spots or blemishes, im really scared. i tell my mum some of this not all and she thinks im crazy. please help im so scared its ruining my life i wake up in the morning thinking of it and go to bed thinking of it Please help. x","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.I am sorry that you are so anxious about getting pregnant. I am sure you know, young lady, that there is no way you can possibly get pregnant without having sexual intercourse. A boy's sperm must enter your vagina and mix with your eggs in order to conceive.In addition, women do not start to \\"show\\" until at least 3 to 4 months of pregnancy. So a bulge in your abdomen, does not diagnose anything except possibly the movement of your intestines.It is also completely normal, at your age, for your menstrual cycle to not occur regularly..I'm a bit concerned about the reason so afraid of pregnancy. Are you afraid of gaining weight? Many young women have issues related to body image and you did mention that you are very thin.It may be beneficial for you to speak to a counselor at school or professionally to help you understand why you have this irrational fear. However, I do want to reassure you again, that unless sexual contact with a boy there is absolutely no way you could be pregnant. A gynecologist or your pediatrician could also help guide you in the right direction.It would also be helpful for you to tell your mother how anxious you are about this so that she may be able to support your getting some professional help.I hope that I was able to answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"i done a clearblue pregnancy test on wednesday. it said pregnant 1-2 which on the box says that means 1-2 weeks since conception. but it also said that my doctor will date this as being 4 weeks pregnant. please help. i dont know how this works and am really confused.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Over-the-counter pregnancy tests check for pregnancy hormone in your urin, however the results are absolutely not reliable in diagnosing the length of gestation. The reason for this, is that the amount of pregnancy hormone in your urine, depending upon how much water you drank, is variable and is not a reliable way to confirm the dating of your pregnancy.However, what the box is explaining is the way that we routinely as physicians calculate the due date for someone's pregnancy. As a convention, the due date for pregnancy is calculated based on the first day of the woman's last menstrual period. The pregnancy test measures the amount of pregnancy hormone, theoretically, from the date of conception. In women with a 28 day menstrual cycle, ovulation typically occurs at 14 days after the start of your period, so, that is why your doctor will refer to your pregnancy as two weeks further along than the pregnancy test.So, in the meantime, I would not worry too much about calculating your due date. When you see a doctor for the first time for this pregnancy, he or she will explain how we determine your due date.Obstetricians generally recommend that you see a doctor for your first prenatal visit at around 6 to 7 weeks gestation (from the first day of your last menstrual period)In the meantime, please begin taking a prenatal vitamin supplement, stop drinking alcohol, and wait and see what happens. As long as you have no bleeding, it is safe to assume that you have a healthy pregnancy and when you see her doctor for the first time they will confirm your due date with an ultrasound examination.I hope I was able to clarify the difference between conception and pregnancy dating based on your last menstrual period. In addition, I hope that my advice was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown."},{"Patient":"Hi, wondering whether or not you think its possible my pregnancy is still viable? Ive neever had any real symptoms other than going to the toilet more. My LMP was 22 October, I did my first pregnancy test on 26th December, strong positive, did another one one new years eve with a clearblue test and it said 1-2 weeks pregnant and said to add 2 weeks on for how doctor would date it. Did yet another test due to no symptoms on 14th January which said 3+ weeks and again to add 2 weeks for doctors dates. I paid for a private scan on the 21st January and they believed by the size it was only 5 weeks 3 days, 10days on and still no crmaping,no bleeding and no symptoms?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.There are two possibilities of what could be going on with your pregnancy. If you really did conceive back in October, your pregnancy should be about 12 weeks. This would have been found on the ultrasound examination that you had but instead the fetus measured only five weeks three days. At five weeks it is not normal to see fetal heartbeat so that is not used in the consideration to make a diagnosis.However, it is possible that you conceived later in the cycle after your. In October. If you actually conceived in late November early December it is still possible that the fetus could be viable and that is just younger than it should be by your dates.So the way to tell the difference would be to get another ultrasound examination and approximately two weeks; by then you should see some evidence of the fetal heartbeat if the pregnancy is normal.Contrary to popular belief, the majority of women do not have pregnancy symptoms. The most reliable sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual cycle. Furthermore, judging the number of weeks of pregnancy on a urine tests is extremely inaccurate. Pregnancy tests are designed to pick up the hormone hCG from that which comes out in your urine. However, your urine can be diluted by different amounts of water depending upon what time in the day you tested and how much water you drank beforehand. Most urine pregnancy tests ask that you use your first morning urine, which has the most concentrated sample, however, even within those restrictions there is a large margin of error.So I would advise, in your situation, that you repeat the ultrasound examination in another 2 to 3 weeks. In the meantime take good care of yourself for the pregnancy by: eating a well-balanced diet, drinking lots of water, and taking prenatal vitamins.Best wishes, and good luck with the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"my gf has regular period on 20 to 26 but we had sex on 21st of august...and next day i gave her unwanted 72....so she got her period on 28 to 2 September...and in the next month now it s 6 oct sgedidn t get her next cycle what could be the reason???help me out","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you todayUnwanted 72, when taken correctly, reduces a woman's chance of pregnancy from an unprotected encounter to less than 10%. However, unfortunately that means that one in 10 women still can conceive even if they take the medication correctly. Furthermore in the cycle that she takes it the medication can delay or affect her cycle.So just to be safe, I would recommend that your girlfriend do a urine pregnancy test. It does not need to be done in the doctor's office you can purchase one over-the-counter. However, she did have a normal menstrual cycle since she took the unwanted, which is a good sign that she is not pregnant.Women can have irregular menstrual cycles from hormonal changes due to stress, weight or schedule changes, and other medical hormonal problems.If her pregnancy test is negative, and your girlfriend is not menstruate for three months, she should see a GYN doctor for an evaluation to figure out why.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"hello i am five months pregnant and my doctor says its okay to have one energy drink a day and i have really bad headaches during my pregnancy to the point of needing vicoden and since i started drinking energy drinks my headaches have stopped when not even coffee or soda has been able to do that so am i harming my baby?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Many women have headaches during pregnancy, because as your blood volume increases to prepare for the birth, the amount of blood flowing to your head increases in intensity, which commonly can cause severe pounding headaches. Caffeine is a vasoconstrictor, which means that it makes the blood vessels slightly smaller and as a consequence it actually is a very effective treatment for headaches. It is actually used as an ingredient in prescription migraine medications.The warning against not using caffeine during pregnancy actually has no real scientific basis. There never been any studies in humans that actually shows an increase risk of any pregnancy-related complication.So, if caffeinated drinks help your headaches, there is no evidence that any harm will come to you or your baby. Furthermore, Vicodin is safe to use during pregnancy for pain as well.I would advise you to try to find the least amount of caffeinated beverage you need to drink to help your headaches. Tea and coffee are much healthier than soda or energy drinks because they usually have a lot of artificial ingredients.So in summary, it is okay if you need to increase your caffeine consumption a little bit. Neither doing that, or taking Vicodin occasionally for pain, will do any harm to your baby.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi , I am 37weeks pregnant.I have been taking 81 mg ecotrine for the duration of this pregnancy after suffering two miscarriages over the last three years.I have noticed a significant increase in mole like growths on my neck and chest during the last trimester.my total weight gain is 26kg during this pregnancy.I am not constantly chewing...pleeas may I ask what the mole may be symptomatic of?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Many women see enlargement of molds or skin tags during pregnancy, which is just due to the increased hormones. This can affect any fleshy growths on all areas of the body.However general these usually decrease in size after delivery.

Pregnancy symptoms can vary widely between women, however these can be confused with the symptoms of PMS or other hormonal issues. In addition, many women have some spotting in the early part of pregnancy, which can be confused for a menstrual cycle.So I think at this point it would be best for you just to do an over-the-counter pregnancy test. These tests are very accurate in diagnosing pregnancy even within three weeks of conception. If this is negative, I would advise you to watch and wait and see what happens with your cycle going forward, and if it continues to be irregular you may want to see your gynecologist for evaluation.I hope I was adequately able to answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"My husband is experiencing tightness of the foreskin around his uncircumcised penis.

Because your SGPT is only slightly over the expected level, I really do not think that anyone is going to be particularly concerned.

However, many women can also experience irregular cycles and hormonal imbalances after discontinuing Depo-Provera. Some women do not resume normal monthly cycles or ovulation for even up to year.So it can be difficult to rule out pregnancy if you have irregular cycles after taking Depo-Provera. Unfortunately, pregnancy related symptoms can vary widely between women and actually most women do not have any symptoms of pregnancy at all before a missed menstrual period. Furthermore many women experience psychological symptoms of pregnancy due to unconscious fears or desires.So I would suggest that you do a urine pregnancy test, so that you know for sure what is going on.

It is also concerning because you say touching your stomach is uncomfortable.I am concerned that you may be experiecning premature labor, or a threateded miscarriage.  You also may have either a uterine or urinary tract infection. These can be a threat to your health and the baby's if they are not treated right away, so I suggest you call your prenatal care provider and make an urgent appointment for evaluation.

The majority of the time during routine prenatal care for diabetes somewhere between 24 and 28 weeks. Ketones, a byproduct of sugar metabolism being present in your urine along with sugar backs up the diagnosis.If you're test for gestational diabetes was performed more than a month ago, or if you never had one, I suggest you share these results with your healthcare provider as they may want to repeat the test.Gestational diabetes can be controlled sometimes with diet, however many women require oral hypoglycemics or insulin to control their blood sugar. This risk is increased in women who are obese or who have a family history of diabetes. So needing additional help in reducing your blood sugar during pregnancy is common and is not the fault of an inability to properly follow a proper diet.So I suggest for the benefit of the health of your pregnancy that you make an appointment with your prenatal care provider and that you discuss your results with them they may want to do more intensive screening for diabetes and depending upon the level of your blood sugar may prescribe medications.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, we are a couple married now for the past 3 yrs now.

Pls suggest that is it right to go in for this treatment, as we are afraid as there are many negative reviews on net. please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Endometriosis is a disease that can be frequently associated with infertility, because it makes a woman bleed internally every time she has a menstrual cycle. This can cause scarring and inflammation which can cause pain for the woman and difficulties getting pregnant.So treatment for endometriosis is effective if it suppresses the woman's natural menstrual cycle. Decapeptyl is one type of medication used for this purpose. This treatment for endometriosis is actually supported by medical evidence.However, the reason why your doctor is prescribing this medication is to cause a drop in estrogen during the early part of your wife's menstrual cycle which theoretically would increase the chance of ovulation. This is not a medically supported dosing regimen, and there are other medications in pill form that can conceive the objective of increasing ovulation rates with less risk and side effects.So in summary, if the medication were prescribed to suppress your wife's menstrual cycles monthly for period of six months to help control her endometriosis that is an effective treatment. However the regimen your doctor is suggesting has not been proven to be effective for increasing fertility, and may produce unpleasant side effects. In addition there are other medications which are not injectable that can be tried first.So I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that the information I gave you was helpful.I wish your wife the best of health and that you are able to conceive successfully,Sincerely, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"i am on the pill yasmin and have not gotten my period during my 7 days free. this has happened me before when i was on yasminelle but i changed to yasmin so it wouldnt happen again. ive been taking yasmin for the past 7 or 8 months and this is the first time i havent got my period on it.. should i be worried of pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Many women stop menstruating while they are taking birth control pills, especially after long-term use. This is because the tissue lining the uterus called the endometrium, becomes so thin that there is too little to be visible externally during the free week.Because all birth control pills contain progesterone, which suppresses your uterine lining, even switching to a pill that has a slightly higher dose of estrogen can sometimes not produce a menstrual cycle.So there is no harm in missing a menstrual cycle while you are on birth control pills. If you took all the pills in the package to close to the same time every day, and use them correctly, your pregnancy risk whether or not you get your period is still less than 1%.So I do not think that you need to be worried about pregnancy in the situation if you are taking your pills correctly and do not feel any different or exhibit any other symptoms of pregnancy.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"hi. i m sara i had a miscarriage last year june almost 8 weeks.and after 6th month at december i m again pregnanat but my baby not growing as yesterday s u/s reported i m 9 week pregnant but sac is only (6+2).i have no bleeding no pain.i feel hunger n gaining weight gradually. i waana ask is every thing ok/ or there r medicines that help fetal growth? plz reply thnx","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.There are two possibilities that could be going on in your situation. The first, is that the pregnancy is actually younger than what would be expected based on your last menstrual period.The second, unfortunately, is that the fetus died during your six week of pregnancy and is just still remaining inside you. The tissue surrounding the pregnancy is what produces hormones that still give you pregnancy related side effects, even if the fetus is no longer developing.Furthermore, there is nothing that can be done to alter the potential outcome of this pregnancy. If it is destined to be a miscarriage there is no medical treatment that can prevent it. So there is no medication that can help the baby to grow or develop normally if it already has been lost.The only thing the can be done, is to watch and wait and see what happens. I would recommend that you have an ultrasound repeated in two weeks to see if the fetus has grown and has a heartbeat. If not, this pregnancy is a miscarriage that is just not passed yet from the body.The positive news, is that even with two miscarriages, there is a greater than 80% chance that the next pregnancy will be completely normal. If this turns out to be a miscarriage, your doctor may want to do some simple tests that can evaluate if you have any other risk factors that might've caused this to happen.I am very sorry about your situation, and I hope everything works out for the best.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I am 24 weeks pregnant and my feet, ankles, and wrists are always really swollen and my feet hurt real bad. They even swell even if I stay home and sitting down most of the time. Also my right arm starts tingling like its asleep like at least twice a day. Is this all normal or should I be concerned","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Swelling is a normal part of pregnancy. Almost every woman has some swelling during the third trimester, and swelling in the joint capsule of your wrist, especially on your dominant hand, can cause symptoms of the condition called carpal tunnel syndrome, which can be treated with wrist braces and is a common problem in pregnant women.However, being abnormally swollen can sometimes be associated with the pregnancy complication called preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a combination of edema, high blood pressure, and protein being released into the urine. Developing preeclampsia as early as 24 weeks is a rare complication but can be very serious if not diagnose promptly. It can put a mother at risk for seizures and strokes, and also cause growth problems for the baby.So I strongly suggest you see your prenatal care provider urgently for evaluation. In the meantime I suggest you monitor yourself for symptoms like headaches, blurry vision, spots in front of your eyes. A right-sided upper abdominal pain. If you experience any of these symptoms you should go to a hospital emergency room for evaluation.I hope that everything turns out to be all right with your pregnancy after evaluation. In the meantime try to stay off your feet, drink lots of water, and monitor the movements of the baby.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I m 14 years old standing about 5 foot 3 inches with a weight around 180 pounds. I m also curently pregnant and just recently had bumps on the skin around my vagina. They went away. I was tested by my obgyn for genital herpes and all three tests came back negative. Then a couple days ago I had another bump. It turned into a purple-ish color the night before last. And today I took a shower and got out of the shower when I realized that the bump had burst. Only blood was released from the bump. Can you tell me what these bumps are?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Many women experience skin changes during pregnancy. In addition moles or other spots on the body can either enlarge or develop, and they go away once the pregnancy is over.However, in your specific case, the fact that you are overweight gives me the impression that these bumps you describe are actually not bumps at all... Instead they are superficial veins called vulvar (or capillary) varicosities (you can look that up on Google and look at the images) very close to the skin surface that are bulging out more now because of the hormones of pregnancy and the pressure while standing on your vulva due to your obesity. You may later develop varicose veins in your legs which are also caused by the same risk factors.  You might have just likely ruptured or scraped off the end of the vein which is what appears as a purple bump on your vulva, which is why it bled. Feel free to discuss this with your home healthcare provider and see what he/she thinks as well.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Good luck and best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"hi i am 19 weeks and 3 days pregnant and have been told that i have low lying placenta ..also underwent ovarain dermoid cystectomy when i was 13 weeks pregnant...in view of above my doc has put me on progestrone tab SUSTEN 200 ,,,kindly advise if i should continue as there has been no spotting so far","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Oral progesterone has no role in the management of pregnancy after the first trimester. You do not need to worry at this point that it has actually hurt the baby, as progesterone is produced in normal healthy pregnancies.In your case, your history of a cystectomy and your low-lying placenta (which likely will go away by the third trimester) are are not actual risk factors for any obstetric complications.So I do not believe that you need to continue the progesterone therapy. There is no harm to the pregnancy that could have come from taking it in the first place, as injectable and suppository forms of the drug are used to treat women at high risk for preterm delivery.So in summary, as long as you have no further complications of your ovaries, and your low-lying placenta resolves by term, there is no reason that you may not have a normal vaginal delivery.I hope I was adequately able to answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"My son is twenty years old and has been diagnosed with Crohn s Disease.

The disease may involve the perianal region and may be presented with a pain in the area. You should contact your doctor. He may have perianal abscess or fistulas. These are complications of Crohn's disease and should be properly diagnosed. Sometimes the diagnosis of the fistulas or abscesses is difficult and he may be ordered MRI.

It is true that theoretically you should been clear of the injection within three months of discontinuation, however many women after being a Depo-Provera for a long time do not resume having ovulatory, regular, menstrual cycles until 6 to 9 months or even up to a year after discontinuation.Unfortunately, it is difficult to artificially induce ovulation in women who are coming off Depo-Provera. If you were not trying to become pregnant, your cycle could be regulated temporarily with birth control pills, but if you're actually trying to get pregnant the best thing you can do with this point is to just keep trying and wait and see. If you feel any symptoms of pregnancy, and you haven't gotten your period for a while, I would do pregnancy test just to make sure. There is always a possibility even if your periods are not regular that you do ovulate sometimes.So in summary, continue having unprotected sex every other to every three days and give it some more time. 80% of couples will conceive within one year, and if after a year of trying you and your partner are unsuccessful, it might be a good idea to see a fertility specialist for an evaluation.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes, and good luck getting pregnant,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, my wife is expected and after having a ultrasound in the 28th week of pregnancy, there were extrarenal pelvis - right kidney 5.8 and left kidney 4.4. I want to know how safe this after birth and is there any harm of this extrarenal pelvis. Please give me detailed information regarding extrarenal pelvis in kidney of fetus.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today. A extrarenal pelvis is a variation of the anatomy of the kidneys which is actually found in about 10% of the population. It is absolutely no long-term medical consequences but it can be confused with other types of urinary obstruction which do not have as good a prognosis therefore it is always important to monitor it if it is seen in a fetus to make sure it is not another more dangerous diagnosis like urinary obstruction.So there are no consequences to the baby's health by having an extrarenal pelvis. Many people who have this condition are not diagnosed until they have a test such as an ultrasound of the kidney or CAT scan for another reason and have never had any symptoms over the course of their lifetime.So there's no reason to worry further about the health of your baby because of the extrarenal pelvis.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring.Best wishes to you and your wife for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi I just found out Im pregnant I am thinking Im probably 1 month or so and Im worried because for the past 3 months I have been taking phentermine and I received 2 laser hair removal treatments. Can you please let me know if this is dangerouse for the baby? I have stopped taking phentermine about 2 days ago when I found out.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today. Unfortunately, phentermine is a medication that is associated with an increased risk of birth defects with exposure in early pregnancy. It is considered a medication that is in pregnancy category X which means we absolutely tell women to avoid during pregnancy and recommend a woman not become pregnant while taking this medication.However, if the pregnancy is so early that a fetus is not yet developed, there is a possibility that the fetus will not be affected. The only thing that can be done at this point is to see an OB/GYN for the pregnancy and confirm the gestational age of the fetus. If the fetus was exposed the majority of the first trimester, there is a high risk of congenital abnormalities. Ultrasound scans can be performed later to screen for malformations, but these will not probably be visible until at least 15 weeks.Regarding laser hair removal, fortunately this does not have any effect on the developing pregnancy, though your skin becomes more sensitive when you're pregnant so I would avoid it.So in summary, I recommend you get evaluation by an OB/GYN as soon as you can. Then you will be able to find out the accurate dating for your pregnancy as well as the potential prognosis depending upon the amount of time that the fetus was exposed. In the meantime, stop drinking alcohol, begin taking prenatal vitamins, and keep a well-balanced diet, drink lots of water, and get an adequate amount of rest.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy and good luck,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"hi im 38 and just found out im pregnant with my 4th baby (i have a 20yr 15yr old and a 20month old) in my last pregnancy i had dieabates and carpol tunnel syndrome, also at the monment i am recovering from a slipped disc, my husdand thinks this pregnancy could be risky and is very worried about my health and how i would cope afterwards, would the pregnancy put extra pressure on my back and would i be able to carry a baby full term with a slipped disc, also i wouldn t want my youngest to miss out on my attention any advice would be great as a termination is something we are thinking about but deep down i dont know if i could do it and im scared that there will be something wrong with the baby. many thanks x","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Back pain is a common occurrence in healthy women during pregnancy, even those without any background disc disease. Because of this, there is definitely a possibility that pain or other symptoms from your slipped disc might get worse as you gain weight and as your pregnancy grows.However, there is no additional risk to the baby or pregnancy from having disk disease.Your history of gestational diabetes is actually the most concerning potential complication for this pregnancy. You should be tested early in the pregnancy to see if you are diabetic, and if you start the proper diet and or medication treatment as soon as possible, it will give you the best likelihood of a good pregnancy outcome.So in summary, the pregnancy itself is not at any additional risk because of your disc disease. However, your back pain could get severe, especially if you gain a lot of weight, and is unpredictable how this will affect your ability to do household activities and care for your other children.I realize this information will not really help you and your husband decide what to do about the pregnancy, however I tried as best as I could to evaluate the medical facts and give them to you see you can make an informed decision.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor, For pregnant women, they have to take calcium and vitamin c. I want to know can pregnant women take coral calcium instead of regular calcium supplement? Can they take ester-c instead of regular vitamin c? What do you think? Thanks for you time... Happy new year.. Heidi","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Calcium supplementation during pregnancy is helpful, as women use calcium to make breastmilk for the baby. Vitamin C is an important part of normal healthy diet as well.However, the type of calcium or of vitamin C really doesn't matter as they all are effective and safe supplements for pregnant women. The most important type of supplement that a woman requires during pregnancy is that of folic acid. Woman must take at least 400 mg folic acid per day to help prevent certain types of birth defects.It may be easier to just buy prenatal vitamins. Prenatal vitamins usually have all the required vitamin and mineral supplements essential for healthy pregnancy in one tablet.  There is no need to take additional supplements unless specifically prescribed by the doctor.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ? Please type your query here...I am 25 weeks pregnant. (my background is:I am on limited activity and no sex due to an emergency cerclage put in at 19 weeks b/c I was 1cm. I am not working now and I do no heavy lifting or exercise to be careful). My problem is that lately I have been feeling very tired, I get short of breath and sometimes even sitting I get short of breath.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Feeling short of breath is not unusual while you're pregnant because the hormones of pregnancy actually have a way of telling your brain to breathe faster. This is to ensure that your baby gets enough oxygen, because as your belly gets bigger your lungs are not able to expand as well. So many women feel the sensation of needing to catch their breath all the time when they breathe when they are in the third trimester.In addition, because you would been on bed rest for so long, you probably are not in very good cardiovascular shape.Another possible reason why you could be feeling short of breath is that there is a possibility that you are anemic. Normally, as part of routine prenatal care we check your blood count as well is a test for gestational diabetes somewhere between 24 and 28 weeks. If you've not yet had this test, it might be a good idea to mention your symptoms to your doctor.Of course, there can be some serious, dangerous things that can cause shortness of breath; like blood clots that spread to your lung, or fluid in the lungs and other pulmonary problems. If you experience any chest pain or severe shortness of breath or start developing a productive cough, you should notify your doctor immediately and possibly go to the hospital for evaluation.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I'm 37 weeks pregnant and I noticed slight blood stains in my underwear.. I put a pad on and am still having blood stains.. I can't tell if this is from my vagina or my hemorrhoid, should I call the doctor or is there something I can do at home to tell the difference","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.One of the ways that you can possibly figure out where the bleeding is coming from is by putting a tampon inside. If, while wearing the tampon, you still see blood on your underwear then the bleeding is coming from your rectum. In that case, there is less to worry about as it is most likely from your hemorrhoids. To reduce the chances of your hemorrhoids causing bleeding, eat lots of fruits and vegetables and drink lots of water, and consider taking a fiber laxative daily. This will not harm the baby, but will rather make your stool softer said it is easier for you to have a bowel movement.If the tampon has blood on it than the bleeding definitely is coming from vagina. A small amount of bleeding can happen during late pregnancy as your cervix starts to soften to eventually prepare for labor. However, this type of blood should be dark brown or purple and mixed with mucus.If you are having bright red blood coming from your vagina, I would call your doctor for advice. If you have any risk factors for bleeding during pregnancy; such as being on blood thinners, having a low-lying or placenta previa, or experiencing any other symptoms like uterine contractions it might be prudent for you to go to an emergency room for evaluation.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"i have been taking folic acid 5mg for three months now before falling preganant, however i recently read that this dose is usually only used for woman who have a risk of health problems like diabetes etc. is this safe for the baby when i do fall pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Folic acid, a B vitamin, is involved in proper development of an unborn fetus and efficiency of folic acid has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of certain kinds of birth defects, called neural tube defects.Is recommended by the CDC (centers for disease control) that women planning pregnancy take at least 400 mcg (micrograms) of folic acid daily. This is the minimum nutritional requirement recommended for this vitamin during pregnancy.Folic acid can also be prescribed up to 4 mg (milligrams)per day for women who are at increased risk for neural tube defects. These people include women who have to take certain medications during pregnancy that deplete folic acid, a family history of previously affected infant with a neural tube defect, and other inherited forms of clotting disorders.However folic acid is a water-soluble vitamin, meaning that any excess in your system be washed out in your urine and there are no harmful effects on your body or the baby's if you are taking higher than the recommended dose.So 5 mg is higher than the standard dose for pregnancy, however it really will not do you or the baby any harm. If anything you can cut the tablets in half and still have the adequate dose for supplementation and prevention of birth defects.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi!

I really dont want to go to the doctor because I dont have a personal doctor. since i am obviously miscarrying will i be okay if I dont go to the doctor?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Many women can miscarry naturally, meaning pass the fetus at home and have no medical consequences afterwards. However it is important for you to know that all the tissue has actually come out of your uterus, because even a small speck of pregnancy tissue left inside you can cause you to bleed irregularly, put you at risk for uterine infection, and prevent you from being able to get pregnant again until it is removed.What I would do in your situation, is buy an over-the-counter urine pregnancy test and retest yourself right before your doctors appointment. If your pregnancy test still comes out positive I do recommend that you follow up with the doctor. This is just to make sure that all of the tissue has come out from your miscarriage and that there are no complications that will affect you in the future. Furthermore, 15% of women bleed in the first trimester of pregnancy, and even though you had a lot of bleeding there is still a possibility your pregnancy could be viable.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi I need to know how acurate 3 dating scans are as a measure of paternity. I know I need to do a dna test but all three scans perfromed at 12, 16 and 20 weeks have provided the same due date and therefore the same conception date and I was with the suppossed father that day. Can you help me?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Estimating your date of conception is only really possible for women who have a 28 day menstrual cycle. By convention, the computer programs that are used to calculate your due date are working from an assumption that a woman has a 28 day cycle, and that conception took place exactly 2 weeks after your last period. If your cycle is longer or shorter, your ovulation could have taken place on a different day than what is estimated.So really just depends on whether you were with your second partner during your fertile window, which really can start 7 to 10 days after the first day of your last menstrual period and continue until a week before your next menstrual period is due.So depending upon how close and timing your sexual encounter with your second partner was, will determine how likely it is for him to be the father. If the margin either way is only a matter of a few days, you really will need a DNA test to accurately predict the paternity of your child.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"About 6 months ago I began having issues with my semen.

Using birth control pills to suppress your menstrual cycle is medically safe and usually effective. However in some cases you can have what is called \\"breakthrough\\" bleeding where your period can sneak through at the wrong time even though your taking the pills correctly.There are birth control pills that are actually prescribed to make your period, only every three months; these brands basically are just three months of active pills in a row and then taking a placebo week every three months. The issue with suppressing your menstrual cycle with the pill, is that frequently it doesn't work until woman has been on three months cycling for six months to a year. Breakthrough bleeding is the most common side effect that women complain of when being on extended cycle oral contraceptives.So I really do not think you need to worry about having had conceived if you took all your active pills correctly. The best way to stop the bleeding at this point is to stop taking the pill for week... Which will reset your cycle and then you will be able to begin a new pack which will end this particular cycle.Suppressing your menstrual cycle also works best with pills that are the same dose all month long and are not particularly low-dose oral contraceptives. Depending upon your situation, if you decide that you may want to suppress your cycle to avoid menstruation, you might want to discuss the brand of pill you take with your gynecologist and possibly changed to one of the brands of pills that are designed for three months cycling.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I'm 28 weeks pregnant. and I went into the hospital with SEVER BACK PAIN, turns out i have a bladder and a kidney infetion.. ive been using a heating pad and a antibiotic they gave me with a iv..the last iv i got was at around 7 30. since i got to my brothers hotel ive been having sweating. headache and when i yawn it now hurts.. my pain feels like it has shifted . ive also felt very very COLD. shivering.. what is wrong with me?","Doctor":"Hi,Looking to the history all symptoms might be due to severe infection urinary tract infection.It will take 2-3 days to starting recovery from infection and getting symptomatic relief from these symptoms.Take analgesic, anti-inflammatory medicine to get temporary relief from symptoms.Take plenty of water.Ok and take care."},{"Patient":"heelloo..yesterday me and my bf had a sex...but we both r with clothes on..he wear a night suit and i have wear a dress..he rub his penis arond virgina .... i dnt know that he get the sperm or not...bur my underwear get wet..so is it possible that i might get pregnant????","Doctor":"Hi,If this sex play done during fertile period, there are all chances of having pregnancy as even few sperms entered into vagina might give rise pregnancy.Go for pregnancy test if you are late for 7-8 days.Ok and take care."},{"Patient":"hi sir h r u im a married man my wife is pregant for the 02 months but she suffers a vomiting in a day 04 to 5 time sometime it goes to 2-3 day and she does not eat properly what should she do please help me out with the situation i much very much thankful to you.","Doctor":"Take doxinate tb 2 hs.

Then try to adjust your sexual intercourses on and around the day of egg release (ovulation). Usually you get copious clear vaginal discharge on the day of ovulation. Ovulation may be monitored by :1. Ovulation monitoring kit or2. UltrasonographyIf the ovulation monitoring confirms that you are ovulating regularly, one parameter has been tested. If any problem in the ovulation is detected, it will have to be tackled on the merits of the cause. The primary intension will be induction of ovulation which in most cases can be achieved by medicines like Clomiphene citrate or Gonadotropins. In spite of this practise if you do not conceive within 6 months, you will have to assess the other factors:1. Patency of the tubes and the genital tract as a whole : Hysterosalpingography (HSG) and Laparoscopy will reveal the status. If there is block anywhere, it will have to be treated surgically. HSG will also help to find out any intrauterine structural pathology.2. Semen Examination to find the quantity and quality of the sperms. In spite of all normal parameters, there is unknown factor which is affecting your fertility, you may have to go for Assisted Reproduction Techniques. I hope this helps you.

Im not sure if its better to wait few more days or do pregn.test even tomorrow morning.Thank you.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,The fact that you had profuse bleeding, may be only for two days, minimizes the possibility of pregnancy. Since you bled quite a lot in two days, the remaining days were with less amount of bleeding. Such a heavy bleeding could also be due to hormonal imbalance - Thyroid or reproductory. If you want to confirm the possibility of pregnancy, you may get urine pregnancy test performed after 8-10 days, done earlier it may give false negative results. Beta hCG tests can give reliable results within 2-3 days. The lethargy you are experiencing is most likely to be due the heavy bleeding you had. Please get your blood examined for haemoglobin.  Starting high protein diet and iron tablets is a good proposition. If such pattern of menstruation persists even after few months, please get your Thyroid function test (T3, T4, TSH) and LH, FSH and Prolactin tested on your blood. I hope this satisfies you.

After 3 months I had period and spotting that lasted a few weeks. Now two months later, my stomach is sticking way out, as if I were 4-5 months pregnant, I am not overweight. 3 pregnancy tests have given negative results. Is there still a possibility of pregnancy or is it more likely I have a cyst. I am 37 and have 10 year old twins. Thank you","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,The depo shot you had contains Progesterone preparation. Withdrawal bleeding after progesterone may be very little. Moreover, it may cause irregular, intermittent spotting. Progesterone does lead to weight gain, due to which you are experiencing protrusion of abdomen. Also it causes salt and water retention giving heavy feeling. If you are not happy with the progesterone depo preparation, you may switch over to other combined birth control  pills or to intrauterine contraception device like Mirena. The later will give you continued protection against pregnancy throughout your reproductory life (being less than 7-10 years). I hope this satisfies you.

Who is most likely my child s father??","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First trimester ultrasound is the most accurate way to date for pregnancy. However, most ultrasounds calculate a \\"conception\\" date estimating an average woman who has a 28 day cycle.There is also a window of time where conception is likely to take place, which in your case, could be anywhere from January 17 through the 31st. I am calculating that counting back from your due date because the measurement of the fetus in early pregnancy by ultrasound can correctly predict the date of conception within five days for after it may have occurred. By convention, we generally do not change the due date for pregnancy unless it is greater than five days off from what is predicted based on the woman's last known menstrual cycle.So in summary, it is most likely your ex-boyfriend is the father of your child.I hope I was adequately able to answer your question today, and that this information was helpful.Best wishes and good luck,Dr. Brown."},{"Patient":"I have had two positive pregnancy tests and have had nausea, fatigue and all the normal things associated with pregnancy, but suddenly yesterday I started bleeding, it's very brown and is accompanied by lining and comes with extreme abdominal cramping, what could this mean?","Doctor":"This is not normal thing.

Is my blood pressure something to worry about","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Rise in blood pressure up to  130/90 mm of Hg is considered as High blood pressure during pregnancy. Usually the pregnancy induced high blood pressure is found after 20 weeks of pregnancy. So this high blood pressure at 17 1/2 weeks suggests that you had essential hypertension dating back to your pre-pregnant days. The other possibility is molar pregnancy where the foetus is replaced by grapes like tissue. Please get your ultrasonography done. Yes, 140/90 is definitely high blood pressure. One of your reading is 120/80 mm of Hg. There could be element of personal error or situational variation in some of the readings. Please monitor your blood pressure by daily checking which will give you clear idea. If you are found to have it more than 130/90 mm of Hg, then you will have to consider it as high blood pressure and follow your Obstetrician's advice sincerely lest the risk of pre-eclamptic toxaemia or Eclampsia (seizures).

Its already hard for me to take deep breaths, I was wondering if i should go to the emerg?","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.In my opinion the pain might be due to muscular pain or any preterm pains.The diagnosis is possible only after physical examination to rule out any cervical changes.The preterm pains are intermittent associated with cervical changes.Also any urinary infection should be ruled out.The infections ,dehydration might irritate the uterus leading to preterm pains.Take adequate fluids upto 3 litres per day and consult doctor to know the cause for pain.Tab.panadol can be taken to decrease the pain.Dont worry it subsides with apt treatment.Best regards...,Consultant Gynecologist."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ? Please type your query here...hello doc,i am into 34th week of pregnancy...last Ultrasound done at 30th week and it showed baby s head down slightly leftwards....now i feel babys hiccups rightwards below my navel....are there any chances that baby is turning back to breech position...how can it be prevented","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.In my opinion during the preterm period mostly the fetus will be in breech position.The fetus will be constantly moving and restricts to one position when nearing to term.There are no methods to prevent breech position.The position depends on the space inside the uterus and pelvis.The fetus gets adjusts to that.So we can't make or prevent any position.It is not usual to feel any hiccups and say position of fetus.The exact position is known by physical examination and ultrasound.So relax.Best regards...Consultant Gynecologist."},{"Patient":"I recently just found out I was 7 months pregnant. I had been having periods over the months and had taken a few pregnancy tests bc I was afraid I might have been because of unprotected sex, but all of the tests were negative. I had no signs of pregnancy at all and when I went for my yearly obgyn visit I was told I was pregnant.    I am worried now that some of the things I've done over the past few months could have hurt my baby since I didn't know I was carrying. What should I do? My doctor says I am fine but I still am afriad for my child.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, I do empathize your concern for your baby. There are certain tests like triple marker tests, nuchal translucency test, etc. which help predict the affection of the foetus. Some gross abnormalities may even be visualized by ultrasonography. If you are so much concerned about the probable abnormality in the development in your foetus, please suggest your obstetrician to get these tests done for you. Other option is to report to the Foetal Medicine Specialist and narrate the whole story in details. This specialist will advise you regarding the confirmation of the status of baby. I hope this helps you. All the best, Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"your health queries right now ? Please type your query here...During my pregnancy I got constipation. Because of constipation now I got cut on my asshole mouth. There is infection. I feel pain. What I do? Which medicine I use or what kind of doctor I visit.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,The hard stools due to constipation has caused an anal fissure which has got infected, as you mention. First step should be to get relief from the anal fissure and get it healed. You may apply local applications like Practosedyl with finger to the legion after every motion and even otherwise also. This will help healing the wound and relieving you from the pain. Simultaneously, you have to get your constipation treated. Initially, try liquid paraffin at bedtime which will soften the stools. However, it should not be continued for long lest the risk of fat soluble vitamin deficiency. Get your stools examined for any evidence of Amoebiasis. If detected, you will have to undergo treatment for it. Metronidazole is an effective medicine for it. Consume lot of fruits, particularly citrus fruits like oranges in your diet. Avoid meat and eggs. These are constipating food articles. Regular use of Isubgul granules at bedtime with lot of warm water will help you get rid of constipation. Iron tablets taken during pregnancy are invariably cause of constipation. If you switch over to time released spansule form of Iron, it will not cause any constipation. I hope this helps you to find relief."},{"Patient":"hi, I'm 19 and I'm on the pill cilest.last Friday me and my boyfriend had unprotected sex and he finished inside me. I take my pill at the same time everyday (10:00pm) and iv never forgot it or taken it any later than about 10 mins after my normal time.I'm just wondering what my chances of being pregnant are? me and my boyfriend have both had the full sti checks and are not sleeping with other people so I'm not worried about stis it's just I'm so scared of getting pregnant.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Cilest is a birth control pill. These pills are having good success rate in preventing the pregnancy. As per your history, you are absolutely regular in taking birth control pills. In that case, you need not have any stress for probable pregnancy. Cilest pills will take care for you. Wait for your menses. I am sure, they will appear in time. If at all they are delayed, get the urine pregnancy test done 8-10 days after the missed period. Performed earlier, these tests may give false negative results. Beta hCG tests are very specific and sensitive which can give reliable results within 2-3 days of missed period. So you may opt for beta hCG test. Honestly I feel, you are unnecessarily worried. Relax and expect your menses on time, within 7 days after completing the pack of Cilest.All the best,Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Okay, this is a REALLY personal, strange question, and I m not 100% positive that you can answer it for me, but I am willing to try, really need an answer here. Let me start by saying I already sought medical attention, today actually, I went to the ER and I told them (what I m about to tell you) what I was experiencing, and they literally completely ignored my problem and only investigated into vaginal discharge they discovered upon examination. I went in because last night when I was about to take a bath, I noticed a small fleshy piece hanging from my vagina (yeah, sorry this is personal, and I feel strange asking, but clearly the ER doctors thought it was nothing yet neglected to ease my mind and let me know what it was). I was not experiencing any pain (until they did the examination and am now a little soar, which is somewhat common for me after such examinations) it s just something I have never seen before and because I am approximately 3 months pregnant it REALLY freaked me out. I have been sexually active since I was about 16 years old, and I googled what I could only describe as fleshy piece of skin hanging from vagina and everyone online seems to think it s the hymen or cherry. This answer doesn t make sense to me because I obviously had multiple sexual relations, and I bled on my first time. PLEASE get back to me on this as soon as you can, I m EXTREMELY frustrated with the ER for not doing what I went it (and paid ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS for...ridiculous). I do plan on seeing an OBGYN in person, but I am currently without a job (searching) and without money and plan on applying for medicad. If you think it s best and cannot honestly for sure 100% answer my question here, I WILL go to see an OBGYN if that is your recommendation. I just want to see if I can get this taken care of without a fee.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,I would not claim that I can satisfy you 100% without seeing the tissue or the hanging skin. However, I will share my opinion with you. This type of skin like looking hanging flakes can be found in fungal (yeast) infection. It causes quite a itching. They can be treated by local application of antifungal cream like Candit. If you are willing to accept messy treatment, you may apply Gentian violet intravaginally. This treatment has to be followed by both the partners simultaneously.  Shaving private parts is advised. Also till you are cured, observe sexual abstinence.   If you can take a clear photograph of the hanging tissue and upload them for my review, I will have a better concept of your lesion. If you are not relieved by the antifungal treatment, you may ask me a Direct question on this forum by going to my profile. There you can  write the whole problem in details and upload the pictures. I hope this satisfies you to some extent.

Since 4 months ago i went to 3 more doctors the last one a week and a half ago , explaining to them i no it sounds crazy but i think i could be almost 9 months pregnant, The doctor laid me down ( im over weight but not serverely) and pressed on my belly, and he said i could be pregnant but if i was there was no way i could be 9 months, I have a easy belly to feel around in is what he said and that he would be able to feel something, He as well gave me a preg test and it said negative, I asked for a ultrasound but he refused and said he thinkgs i have gallblader issues. DO you thik i still may be pregnant? what are the chaces of someone 25 yrs old, pretty healthy, 5'4 165 lbs be 9 months preg and not look or feel it?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,I do empathize your problem. A pregnant uterus of 9 months would have completely filled the abdomen and you would have felt the foetal movements 20 weeks onwards. Even your so many pregnancy tests are negative. So let us rule out the possibility of pregnancy; though I feel ultrasonography would have been a better tool to clinch the diagnosis. Ultrasonography would help us to find out the status of your ovaries, whether they are Polycystic (PCOS), whether you have  any infection of the uterine lining like tuberculosis, and so many other conditions also. Considering your high BMI, the chances of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome are quite high. You may get your blood checked for FSH, LH, Prolactin, Oestrogen and Progesterone. Also, please get your Thyroid function tests (T3, T4, TSH) performed on your blood. If needed further investigations may be suggested. I would advise you initially to take some Progesterone preparation like Tablets Deviry for 5 days. After discontinuing the pills, you should get your menses within 4-7 days (if amenorrhoea is due to hormonal imbalance). I sincerely feel, ultrasonography may throw some light on your mysterious delay in  menses. Please keep  in touch (may be by asking me a Direct question) after the suggested steps and investigations.

Unfortunately, cervical polyps can bleed heavily if removal is attempted during pregnancy. However, because yours is so long and is already protruding from the vagina it might be prudent for your obstetrician to attempt to remove it.I have performed such a procedure on two patients such as yourself by using suture material to tie off the base of the polyp and taking off the end part that is protruding from the vagina.For now, there is nothing that needs to be done about the polyp. It will not harm your baby, however it might get torn or damaged during birth, so I suggest you call your OB provider and discuss the issue with them. The polyp will not go away by itself; so it would be in your best interest to probably have at least part of it removed, so that it does not protrude any longer from the vagina.I hope I was able to adequately answer your questions today and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown."},{"Patient":"Yes I m 38 weeks pregnant n I been constipated through out my pregnancy but just got out the shower n I felt balls around my anus when I washed so I went n looked at it n there are two white balls sticking out my anus n a large purple discolored circle on my crack u can only see it if I open it no pain and I m more worried about the white bumps","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.The most likely explanation for the bumps in your anal area that you have noticed recently, is the development of external hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids are veins in and around the anus that become dilated from the pressure of your uterus and the baby's head pushing downwards, especially when you try to move your bowels.  The white bumps that you see are most likely hemorrhoids that have not become swollen with blood. The blue one that you see, more likely is closer to the surface, where the blood can be visible through the wall of the vein.As long as your anus does not itch, or that you don't have any bleeding from the area, there is nothing danger about hemorrhoids. They will generally resolve after delivery.I would ask your obstetrician to take a look at them the next time you have an appointment. In the meantime, taking sitz baths, which is soaking your rear end in a warm top filled with about 6 inches of water for 20 to 30 minutes, can decrease the swelling.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.

For the last three days I ve been vomiting yellow and this morning I started vomiting orange. It hurts to stand up. My back and stomach are sore. What would you say I should do.?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Nausea and vomiting are common in early pregnancy, and an orange to ensure vomit may indicate blood. The fact that you have Crohn's disease and Rh negative blood is not really relevant at this point in pregnancy however if you cannot hold down food and are becoming dehydrated and starting to see blood in your vomit you really do need to see a physician for evaluation. Your best bet if you do not yet have health insurance is to go to a local emergency room and see a doctor there to make sure that you are okay and they can possibly prescribe some antinausea medicine for you to take.If you cannot hold down any solids or liquids during this period it is also important that you seek emergency care, because you may be very dehydrated and they can give you IV hydration and antinausea medciation in an emergency setting.Other conservative things you can do at home include taking vitamin B6 and also trying any products made from ginger especially sucking candies or sips of ginger ale as these can help to alleviate nausea.If you start to see bright red blood in your vomit you need to seek emergency care immediately. If not I would try ginger products and vitamin B6 at home and try to slowly sip bland liquids as much as possible.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today and I hope you seek appropriate medical care and that you feel better.Best of luck with the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown."},{"Patient":"I am 6 weeks pregnant.

I took off the film and put foil over it instead and opened the doors/window. Does this type of plastic cause birth defects if inhaled. Will my baby be okay?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.A general guideline that is useful about pregnancy is to think of it as if regarding certain products fumes and other accidental exposures, if it doesn't harm you, it will not harm the baby. If you ventilated the area and you did not have any symptoms of headache dizziness or blurry vision is most likely that these fumes did not get inhaled by you significantly and therefore they cannot do damage either to you or to the baby.There is also no evidence that exposure to fumes from plastics, aerosol cleaning products, or similar items causes birth defects.So certainly your exposure to burning plastic in that context is nothing to worry about regarding your pregnancy.I hope that the information was reassuring, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes, Dr. Brown."},{"Patient":"Hi..

Also Keep a Vaproizer ON in your room where you spend most of the day and night time. It will help open the airway and will also possibly reduce irritation and so the cough. Hot fomentation is good technique in home remedies and is natural way to get the muscle sprain treated. You can alternate it with cold compresses. The combination of both makes the treatment even more better for pregnant femaes with any kind of muscle aches.Any salicylic acid containing ointment or gel should be avoided as we categorize it as category C and is usually non-recommended drug. So to be on the safe side I usually recommend Capsaicin Topical to apply on the affected area. Do gargles with Lukewarm water with salt in it.I hope you may get an eventless pregnancy and a normal delivery. Continue consulting at this healthcare forum if you ever need us in future too.

By regular unprotected sex, I mean having sex 2 to 3 times a week from the time your period finishes, until you start to feel premenstrual symptoms- which means that you are either already pregnant, or cannot conceive that cycle.If you have regular menstrual cycles, and you are young, there is no reason to predict that you are infertile. I do not recommend the use of ovulation kits to attempt pregnancy at this time. Too much stress about trying to get pregnant can inhibit your efforts.So I suggest you and your husband try to relax and let nature take its course. I recommend that you begin taking a folic acid supplement, or prenatal vitamin, as these both are beneficial for conception.If you and your husband try to get pregnant for a year and are unsuccessful, I would then recommend seeing a GYN doctor or infertility specialist in order to diagnose what may be wrong.I hope I was adequately able to answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes and good luck, Dr. Brown."},{"Patient":"Hello, I am almost four month pregnant with my first child and when i go to the toilet to ither urinate or have a poo i notice in the toilet a thickish white discharge which has only been happening the past week.

This type of infection can only be treated with antibiotics. There are numerous types of antibiotics that are safe to use in pregnancy, and I'm sure your obstetrician would be able to prescribe one that is safe for the baby.I do not recommend continuing the diphenhydramine, unless you have a stuffy or runny nose. Diphenhydramine is generally used to treat allergies and will only make your throat dry.So I recommend you buy some throat lozenges, get adequate rest, drink lots of fluids, monitor your body temperature, and see how you feel after a few more days. If you develop fever greater than 101° work your symptoms start getting any worse, I suggest you see your doctor back or call and ask for prescription for antibiotics.

Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello and I hope I can help you today.Azithromycin is an antibiotic that is safe to use at all points in pregnancy. However because your symptoms changed from a sore throat to a cough it is unlikely that your symptoms are due to a bacterial infection.However, certain types of pneumonia are treatable by azithromycin. So I suggest you take the medication as prescribed by your doctor because it is safe for your baby, and will not hurt if you only have a viral illness.Definitely continue conservative treatment like drinking lots of hot liquids, getting adequate rest, and keeping a healthy diet.It is also safe to take over-the-counter cough suppressants during pregnancy.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes with the rest of the pregnancy, and I hope you feel better,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

I want to know if i have temptation for sweets some times can i consume few sweets. Is it advisable and if i take sweets will it affect my baby.I am in my 36th week. regards, Vijaya","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.I am very sorry that you happen to be diabetic during her pregnancy. It is very difficult to achieve good sugar control, and the fact that you are on insulin shows that a good diet alone is not enough to control your blood sugar.So, if you deviate from your diet and increase your blood sugar levels, you are undermining the work of the insulin that you already take.The baby grows the most during the last month of pregnancy, and eating sugary foods or having a high blood sugar can make the baby grow very large and get fat which can increase the risk of cesarean section and birth injury.So I know it is extremely difficult, but it is not medically advisable for you to eat sweet things like candies, dessert and sugary drinks. You only have one month left of the pregnancy, so please try for your baby's sake to adhere to your diabetic diet as much as possible until the birth.In some drugstores, they sell sugar-free sweets and candy. If these are available to you, you certainly can consume them, or chewing sugar-free gum, can sometimes help with a craving for sweets.If you really need something sweet eating fruit is a healthier way to help ease a craving because it has fiber and nutritional value.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Try to hang in there for just a little bit longer until the baby is born.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy and delivery,Dr. Brown."},{"Patient":"my wife underwent a CT scan during early pregnancy(1-2 weeks).My doctor has recommended for tripple test with NFT and 2nd level ultrasound. is it necessairy to do chronic villius sampling and amniocentesis to check the health of fetus. i am confused what to do for amniocentesis test result and abortion timings if it is negative and also chance of miscarriage. kindly help me.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.It takes a very high dose of radiation in order to cause any harm to pregnancy. In the early first trimester, high doses of radiation will produce miscarriage, rather than a genetically abnormal fetus.Furthermore, a cumulative radiation dose of under 5 rd (which is the radiation in about three CAT scans) has not been shown to be a risk for malformations in developing human fetuses.Amniocentesis, or chorionic villus sampling, can only detect diseases of the chromosomes of the fetus. The fetuses chromosomes are formed at conception, and would not be affected by radiation exposure. Therefore these tests are not necessary unless a high risk is detected on the routine screening tests such as the triple test use in all pregnancies to calculate risk for chromosomal abnormalities.So in summary, I would not recommend aborting this pregnancy based on a radiation exposure under 5 rd before fetus even develops. I agree with your doctor to do the routine genetic screening-which consists of a triple test with nuchal translucency (NT) beginning at 11 weeks gestation and only consider amniocentesis or CVS if that testing appears normal. A level II ultrasound also is essential in every pregnancy to rule out birth defects.However, I want to reemphasize that if the fetus survives the first trimester, It is unlikely that the radiation exposure caused any effect on the pregnancy at all.I hope that I was adequately able to answer your question today, and that my advice is reassuring.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"i am 35 weeks pregnant and i had sex with my husband last night and when i went to the bathroom after a bunch of glossy yellow stuff came out i dont know what it is cause normally when he goes in me and i go to the bathroom its clear stuff that comes out so could this be mu mucus plug or what can it be.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Vaginal discharge during late pregnancy increases and turns more like yellow mucus as your cervix starts to soften. This is caused by hormonal changes and has nothing to do with labor. This is not necessarily your mucous plug as that usually produces some bleeding as well is discharge.So as long as you did not experience vaginally bleeding, this mucus may not have anything to do with your body getting ready for labor.If you start to experience any regular, painful contractions, or have any vaginally bleeding, or leakage of clear to white watery fluid that drips from the vagina, you should call your doctor or midwife as these may be signs of labor.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy and delivery,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi I am 10 weeks pregnant and for the more past for the last 10 weeks my ovaries have been hurting but for the last week it has really been constant. I have tried getting ahold of my OB/GYN but he has not gotten back to me yet. Is this normal for my ovaries to hurt?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.In the first trimester of pregnancy, your ovaries produce the hormone progesterone which normally is made by the placenta once it reaches adequate size. So it is not unusual in the first trimester pregnancy to feel pain in your ovaries. In addition, as your uterus stretches, you also may experience some cramping and pulling sensations, which can be on the sides.The only thing that is concerning is if you have not had an ultrasound this pregnancy to confirm that it is normal and located in your uterus. If you already have had an ultrasound for this pregnancy it is unlikely that there could be anything harmful going on, especially if you are not bleeding.So if the pain is severe enough that you cannot function, especially if you have not yet had an ultrasound, if you cannot reach her doctor within a reasonable amount of time, you may want to pursue care in an emergency setting. If you have had a normal ultrasound earlier in this pregnancy, you really do not need to worry, as your ovaries are normally examined as part of your pregnancy ultrasound and a large cyst would've already been detected. Tylenol, or acetaminophen is safe to use for pain at the normal adult dosage during all trimesters of pregnancy and you can try to see if that helps with the pain.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hello, I am 35 and 6 weeks pregnant. Prior to pregnancy I tachycardia after I eat and during digestion. Now with the pregnancy I have tachycardia all the time unless I lie down. It wakes me from sleep at about 136bpm and if I stand long enough to shower, I feel like I will pass out. My BP is normally borderline line high, but when I standing to comb my hair I felt faint so I took my BP standing with wrist monitor. It was 100/60 pulse 157. I feel poor circulation in my left arm and get mild to mod short chest pains. Can anything be done for me besides beta blockers which they refuse to give me because of the pregnancy","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Tachycardia is relatively common during pregnancy. It most usually occurs without underlying heart disease. The most common reason for tachycardia is dehydration and/or low blood pressure, which is common during pregnancy. Anemia, which is also common during pregnancy, can be a contributing factor.Many people have tachycardia after a large meal, because the blood from their body is being shunted to their gut to digest the food; therefore the blood pressure to the rest of the body goes down. This is also what makes you feel tired after a large meal.Fluctuations in blood pressure especially when you stand up are common during pregnancy. Your blood pressure can become very low while you were standing up, and your body tries to bring more oxygen to your brain and heart by increasing your heart rate.Ways to avoid this can include making sure you get up very slowly and also drinking lots of water every day; we recommend at least 3 L of water per day during pregnancy. In addition, I would purchase prenatal vitamins and an iron supplement and begin to take those daily.Regarding beta blockers, there are certain types that can be used safely during pregnancy. I suggest you make an appointment with an obstetrician relatively soon and they may recommend referral to a cardiologist for evaluation. If you have left-sided chest pain that does not resolve when you lie down, or associated with shortness of breath or dizziness, I would recommend that you go to an emergency room for evaluation.But in the meantime, I would start by getting up very slowly, drinking lots of fluids, and taking an iron supplement.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes, and good luck with the pregnancyDr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I am 31 weeks pregnant and my husband is painting our basement for a remodel project. My ob/gyn said I could stay in the house on the top floor if we use a low VOC paint and keep the ceiling fans on upstairs. We live in Iowa so leaving the windows open full-time was not an option and he told me that if I did smell fumes to open the windows for awhile to get fresh air. The first morning my husband had appplied a polyurethane coat to a fireplace mantle and he forgot to open any windows. I could not smell it in our bedroom but once I got to the kitchen area I could so I immediately opened up windows and turned on the fans. I kept the fans on all the time and the windows I would keep open for an hour and then close for an hour but I still got a minor headache. The next day he started the paint and we did the same thing with the windows open intermittently as we smelled fumes and kept the fans on. I got a minor headache again so I left the house and went to my parents house. My headache was lessened after leaving but even after 4 hours of not being at my house I still had a dull headache that Tylenol did not even help. I eventually drank some caffeine and that took it away. Now the next day I still have a very small headache so does that mean the headache is probably caused by something else rather than just the fumes? I would have thought the headache would be gone once I left the fumes if that was the cause. I am wondering if I could have a touch of flu or dehydration instead and the fumes just exacerbated that. Also with being pregnant could my senses just be so heightened that that gave me a headache since my husband could barely smell any paint and did not get a headache and he was the one painting in the area. Just curious as I am scared that if the fumes gave me a headache that it could have affected the baby somehow. I was not right in the painted area but yet ventilation was probably not adequate enough.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First, I want to reassure you that nothing from the paint fumes could possibly have harmed your baby. Paint fumes can give anyone a headache which is why painting in a well ventilated area is recommended. Furthermore, it is very common for pregnant women to get headaches because of the increased blood volume created by pregnancy. The reason that pregnant women \\"glow\\" is because every time your heart beats more blood flushes into your face, which can in some women cause throbbing headaches. Caffeine, because it constricts the blood vessels, can help these types of headaches.So I believe that you were most likely just more sensitive to the paint fumes than someone who is not pregnant. I would encourage you to try a little bit more of a caffeinated beverage and lying down with your eyes closed if the headache is still severe.But I want to reassure you again that the fumes, as they do not have any permanent effect on you, cannot hurt the baby.If your headache gets worse, and is associated with any strange symptoms such as blurry vision, seeing spots in front of your eyes, or numbness or tingling anywhere in your body, you should probably go to your doctor's office or your labor and delivery unit for evaluation as these can be symptoms of a migraine or headache from other cause.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes, and good luck with the rest of the pregnancy, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have had penile discharge for a few days now, no other symptoms are present i.e no pain, discomfort, no burning sensation when urinating, no swollen glands or testicles etc, I havent had a sexual encounter for over a year and that was protected, just wondering what the issue could moat likely be?","Doctor":"Hi, Discharge means yellowish or foul.smelling?

Is it depression or pregnancy hormones?","Doctor":"Hi dear , I have gone through your question and i understand your concern.Hormonal changes can also make you feel more anxious than usual. Anxiety is another condition that can and should be treated during pregnancy.Depression and anxiety may go undiagnosed because women often dismiss their feelings, chalking them up to the temporary moodiness that often accompanies pregnancy. So don't be shy about letting your doctor or midwife know if you feel low. Your emotional health is every bit as important as your physical health. And in fact, it can affect your physical health.Risks of Untreated Anxiety and Depression During Pregnancy like Low birthweight &Premature birth (before 37 weeks).But by just Lifestyle modification you can avoid such situations, just feel well ,avoid any stress, do activities which make you feel light and comfortable, if you don't feel happy while many peoples around you or you are surrounded by loud noise then just avoid them ,talk to people who are positive and to whom you love talking ,watch television and talk with your close friends and take assistance if required, sharing your thoughts make you feel better so please  don't shy to share them with your midwife for GP and if still not helpful then I will advise you to consult a qualified psychiatrist and to tell him about your anti depression medications which you were taking.

All my reports have been fine considering baby weight, amniotic fluid & doppler flow. However, my last ultrasound a couple of days ago showed the baby in a head up position with a single loop of cord around neck. Can I still have a normal delivery? can the baby turn on its own in due course of time to engage in head down position, before my delivery date which is 14th Feb.?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.If your baby is in the head up position at term, it is not recommended that you deliver vaginally, because there is risk to the baby of birth injury. So if you reach your due date with your baby in the head up position, your obstetrician will likely recommend cesarean section.However, there is a possibility that the baby could turn around on its own. Ways to help this to happen is to do what you can to let your belly hang to give the baby a chance to rollover. Going on your hands and knees and arching your back high into the air, like an angry cat, for 10 minutes every day, can sometimes help the baby to turn around naturally.However, the best way to help the baby to turn around is for your obstetrician or midwife to perform a procedure called a version. In the US, versions, which literally are done by the doctor pushing the baby into a somersault is performed under ultrasound guidance in a hospital setting. It works about 50% of the time and can give a woman a chance at a normal vaginal delivery.Regarding the cord around the baby's neck, 15% of normally delivered infants have an umbilical cord around their neck. So the presence of the cord around the neck now does not mean that there will be any problems with labor and delivery if the baby is able to get into the right position.If you are considering having a version, I suggest that you speak to your delivering provider about it soon, as the success rates of version decrease significantly after 37 weeks.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and this information was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy and delivery,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi. I use Ortho Evra birth control patches. usually my period is only 4-5 days. however recently having sex with my boyfriend, after him ejaculating inside me, my period randomly came on 2 weeks in advance.But before my boyfriend and i had sex i wasn t wearing my patch when he came inside me. i put one on 2 days after us having sex.. the weird thing is my blood is dark red and clumpy and my flow is heavy. after a couple days upon me removing my patch the blood started to go away, however when i put on a new patch it started bleeding again and this time heavier, and it has been 7 days now of bleeding. im afraid im going to become anemic with all this blood loss.

No backup contraception is needed. If this event occurs for more than 1 day (24 hours or more), or if the woman is not sure how long the patch has been detached, she should stop the current contraceptive cycle and start a new cycle immediately by applying a new patch. Backup contraception, such as condoms, spermicide, or diaphragm, must be used for the first week of the new cycle.don't worry you will get well soon with reapplying patch and starting new cycle.Hope you find the answer helpful, please do get back for further queries I will be happy to assist you.Rate 5 stars for answer if you are happy.Wishing your good health.RegardsDr.Vigyan Mishra"},{"Patient":"I had unprotected sex on the 18th of december a day after my period, He came in me.

The great majority of people who have chlamydia have no symptoms at all. Normally, it is recommended that if you have a previous partner who is diagnosed with chlamydia that you undergo treatment because having the infection even without symptoms is so common.So your new girlfriend is probably right that you were the one who spread chlamydia to her. Of course this is not your fault, as you did not know that you carry the infection. However in order to cure both your current girlfriend and you it is recommended that you both have treatment at the same time so you cannot spread it back and forth to each other. Even if you get tested and it is negative, there are significant number of false negative tests, so it is still recommended that you both be treated.Your girlfriends obstetrician, at least in the United States, is allowed to write you a prescription for the correct medication. I suggest you attend one of her prenatal appointments with her so that possibly you could both take the medication at that visit at the same time if they have it available.So in summary, most people, both men and women, have no symptoms when they have chlamydia.

So I was wondering whether the cramps Ive been getting could be associated with constipation instead of the pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Many women experience cramping during early pregnancy, from the uterus stretching out and also from hormone production by your ovaries. As long as this is not accompanied by any vaginal bleeding, this is completely normal.If you are not constipated, it is unlikely that the cramping is caused by constipation.So in summary, it is completely normal to feel occasional cramping in the first trimester pregnancy.

It is caused both by the hormones of pregnancy and some of the ingredients and prenatal vitamins.When your stool is very hard, occasionally it can cause some bleeding around the anus if a particularly large stool is passed. In addition, hemorrhoids, which are common cause of rectal bleeding, can develop during pregnancy. These are not harmful and can be diagnosed by an examination by your obstetrician.I suggest that you make sure that you drink lots of water and I recommend that you buy a stool softener or other mild laxative as these are safe to use during pregnancy. Applying petroleum jelly or hydrocortisone cream using toilet tissue after a bowel movement can help lubricate the area to help stool to pass.If you continue to bleed every time you pass stool or the bleeding becomes heavy (like seeing blood in the toilet when you have a bowel movement) it may need further investigation.Otherwise, I would take a stool softener or laxative and discuss your situation with your obstetrician at your next appointment.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I m 24 years old low T 2.22 after ultra sound Can a spermatocele reduce and lower testosterone production in the body and low sperm count?low testosterone for spermatocele can it s be reverse?please sir give clear and brief for understan actual problem for low sperm and low T.","Doctor":"Hi, Spermatocele is a scanning diagnosis.

Please i need your help","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Unfortunately, the reason you are no longer menstruating regularly at age 48 is because do not have many viable eggs left in your ovary anymore. Once you stop menstruating for a full year, you are considered in menopause.There is no way to undo menopause nor is there a way to conceive naturally if you no longer produce eggs.Even a fertility doctor will not be able to make you ovulate if you no longer have viable eggs. Therefore, women in your situation can only conceive through in vitro fertilization, with another woman's eggs use as a substitute for your own.There are medications that you can take that may help you to menstruate however these will not make you ovulate nor help you to conceive.So in summary I am sorry to tell you that once you are in menopause natural conception is not possible by any means.

Such bleeding is usually low in amount. In good old days this was labelled as placental sign. In such cases, you have to look for the other symptoms of pregnancy. The cardinal symptoms and signs of pregnancy in first three months are:1. Missing a period. 2. Frequency of urination without burning.3. Nausea & Vomiting with aversion of food taste. More inclination for sour items. 4. Breast signs: They include brownish to blackish discolouration of nipples and areola with increase in the size of areola. Some tubercles (Montgomery's tubercles) appear under the areola. On squeezing, clear secretions or milk may be expressed from the nipples.  The breasts engorge in size rendering the clothes rather tight. Due to engorgement, they become somewhat tender also. 5. After about 6 weeks of pregnancy, urine pregnancy test becomes positive. Earlier it may give false negative results. However, beta hCG tests, which are very specific and sensitive give reliable results as early as 4 weeks of pregnancy. 6. After six weeks ultrasonography gives direct visual evidence of pregnancy.7. On clinical vaginal examination, the size of the uterus is increased, which is well appreciated after 6 weeks. By this time, the uterus is felt soft. Considering the family history of occasional bleeding during pregnancy, I would advise you to get the status of pregnancy confirmed by reliable method after reliable time. Only symptoms may misguide you. I hope this will help you for proper actions.

Thanks for consulting on the best health consult website.Well, the issue of diarrhea and vomiting is very common as there are more chances of infection during pregnancy including gastrointestinal tarct infections. Same is the case with you. It will be cured soon.For diarrhea and loose motions take a healthy diet and add Psyllium in regular routine. We have seen it effective even for Fecal Incontinence. You will get regular stools soon.For vomiting you need to take EnVePe tablet and if there is a need for prescription, you may need to consult a local area physician for that.Keeping a good balance of fluids and electrolytes is important too and for that you need to keep taking plenty of fluids and Pedilyte. Also get your blood pressure checked on regular prenatal visits as there are chances for hypertensioin and needs to be taken care of timely.Your weakness is due to loss of fluids in diarrhea and depletion of electrolytes too.

I had my period on November 25th-30th and I usually have 18 days before i start my period again.. It's been 4 days now that I haven't gotten my period. I was wondering if it's possible that I can be pregnant and would it be to early to take a home pregnancy test?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Considering 5 days of bleeding and 18 clear days before you start your menses, your menstrual cycle seems to be of 23 days. Then your day of egg release (ovulation) would be 11th day of menstruation. The egg is alive for 24 hours and the sperms are active for 72 hours. Thus day 7 to day 15 of your cycle would be fertile period for you. You had sexual intercourse on day 6 of the cycle, which is very close to the Fertile period. Therefore, possibility of conception cannot be ignored. It is barely 4 days that you have missed your period. The usual urine pregnancy tests are reliable 8-10 days after missed period; earlier the chances of false negative results are high. However, beta hCG tests are very specific and sensitive and can give reliable results within 2-3 days of missed period. So you may opt for beta hCG test. I hope you have got the guidelines to follow.

Thank you :)","Doctor":"Dear Madam, Your narration could not clarify when did you have your menses, whether you missed it and on which day the cycle you had sexual intercourse. Also cannot figure out whether you are still on Cerazette, which is a birth control pill. In that case the chances of pregnancy are very remote. To guide you further on the urine pregnancy test: Usual urine pregnancy tests are more reliable 8-10 days after missing the period, before which they may give false negative results. However, beta hCG tests are more specific and sensitive and can give reliable results even within 2-3 days of missed period. You may try this test to clear the dilemma in your mind if you have missed your period. If you have not missed the period, please do not panic. Wait for your periods. If you miss the period, then only follow the guidelines about the pregnancy tests given above. I hope this helps you.

Precum contains some sperms. The sperms are active and forward moving. They can swim through the vagina towards the egg if it is present that time. They are active for 72 hours. If it is under 72 hours of this incidence, better give her post coital pill. Else, wait for her menses to appear.

We started out unprotected for about a minute or two then he put a condom on. The next morning I woke up feeling nasueas and had a huge headache but it lasted most of the day so I don t think it was morning sickness, but the past two days I ve had a very light brown discharge showing up here and there in my underwear and some small bubbly feelings in my stomach. He never ejaculated into me but I m afraid the pre seminal fluid may have gotten me pregnant...or am I just ovulating or something?","Doctor":"Hallow Baby,You are too anxious. Woman releases egg (ovulation) only once in the cycle and that is around 14 days prior to the nest expected menses. Considering 24 hours' life of the egg and 72 hours' sperm activity, the fertile period is about a week around the day of ovulation. You had sex on last day of your menstrual bleeding. Even if before putting on condom he had ejected precum into your vagina, on this day the chances of presence of egg are almost nil. The brownish discharge was the remains of menstrual blood coming out late. The symptoms of pregnancy like nausea, vomiting appear about 8-15 days after missing a period. So these symptoms have nothing to do with your pregnancy. Associated headache suggests the possibility of stress of pregnancy and/or influenza. If the symptoms have vanished, you need not do anything for them. You should get your menses on expected day. If you continue to be under stress, it may delay your menses. If at all you miss your period, wait for 8-10 days and then get urine pregnancy test done for diagnosing the possibility of pregnancy. I am sure, you will not need it.

The weak positive test may be false positive, however considering the seriousness of ectopic pregnancy, it is better to err on safer side and get investigated for ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy implanting outside the uterine cavity, most commonly in the tubes. Such pregnancy cannot go to the term and may rupture causing alarming intra-abdominal bleeding necessitating surgical intervention with blood transfusion.  Please report to your Obstetrician to clarify the situation. I hope this sends you the required message.

It only just happend 5 minutes ago, i cant get to the phone to call a ambulane either. I feel the urge to push but i dont know weather to push or not. I Can Hardly Move and i was wondering if i could get some live help from you to deliver it?","Doctor":"Dear Mom,If you are getting pains, you are in labour. However, the water trickling down your legs suggests that your bags of water have been ruptured. If it is without any pains, you have risk of infection if the labour does not start. If you are full term, you should be delivered ASAP. If you are premature, doctor has to do something to stop the leaking. From your apprehension, it appears that this is your first pregnancy (primi). After the initiation of labour, it takes more than 16 hours to deliver for the primi. So you need not worry. Please keep your laptop aside, get up, get your phone and call the Obstetrician. Your baby will not get hurt. By just sitting in a place, you are increasing the risk of complications of your delivery. Dry labour may lead you to the caesarean section, or even may cause risk to the life of the baby. I hope you have got the message and will take prompt action to move to the maternity home.

Any woman having unprotected sex is at risk for pregnancy, however, You do not have to worry about being pregnant right now because the HCG test is extremely reliable if performed correctly in diagnosing pregnancy. The most common sign of pregnancy is a missed period. If your period is coming regularly every month, it is extremely unlikely that you are pregnant. Feeling your pulse on your abdomen is not unusual when you are thin, you are just feeling the beating of your abdominal aorta, which is the large artery connecting your heart to your legs. So in your situation right now. you can rely on the results of the pregnancy (HCG) test and feel confident you are not pregnant.

The Nuvaring used alone is greater than 99 percent effective in preventing pregnancy. Many women use it without a backup method of birth control. In addition, because the Nuvaring is absorbed through the skin of the vagina, its effectiveness it not reduced by antibiotics because the medication is not swallowed so it is not metabolized in your liver like oral birth control. In addition, the majority of women do not ovulate during their menstrual cycle even  off birth control. So I really do not think you are at risk of pregnancy in your situation. I hope I was able to answer your question and that this information was reassuring. Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

You are likely to see your period with a delay of a week or two and if you become overdue by ten days, please see a specialist for further management. Pregnancy is unlikely, firstly, because you needed the pill during the safe period and secondly, since you took the pill within the stipulated time and also had the withdrawal bleed. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"hi I had my period on 18/09/2015 and we had unprotected sex on 23/09/2014 then i took prostino 2 within 24 hours (1st one after 12 hours and 2nd one after 24 hours) my next period date should be 14/10/2015 and i had menstral pains on 12/10/2015 so i thought its safe and had unprotected sex on that day. but still i havent got my periods and its 7 days delay now.  can this be due to prostino 2?","Doctor":"Hi,    I understand your concern.    You had sex on 23-9-15. , that is on 5th day of menses. that was in safe period( as you had regular 28 days cycle )-- and actually not needed. Postinor is an emergency contraceptive & acts by postponing ovulation . .. this means your regular ovulation was postponed by postinor ( After 28th of September, when you had no contraceptive protection../ usually after three weeks of postinor there is bleeding. In your case it was expected on13th of Octber.             Wait for .a couple of days for bleeding , otherwise go for pregnancy test  ( blood test) which will exactly give pregnancy status.

Yes moderate  rise of temperature  for first 48 hours after  embryo transfer is normal. It is due to progesterone that are given along with the procedure.

If the sac is small (less than 2 cm) there is a possibility that the pregnancy is just younger than you expect and that a fetus could still develop.However if the sac is of sufficient size (over 1.5-2cm) and there is no fetus present it is most likely an early pregnancy failure (miscarriage that has not yet come out).  Correlation with your preganacy hormone levels can also give more information.However, it cannot hurt to wait and see another 2 weeks just to make sure, as not every pregnancy follows the expected patterns of development.  But you should be prepared as the greatest likelihood is that this is not a normal pregnancy if the sac is large enough.One in 10 pregnancies end in miscarriage, and nothing can be done to prevent one if a fetus never develops in the first place.  However, that means that if you try again, 90% of the time everything will be fine.I hope I was able to answer your question and this advice was reassuring.Best of luck for the rest of the pregnancy, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"hi this is my 1st pregnancy & i had sex during ovulation & 13 days after ovulation i started 2 spot at 1st it was pink then brown then fresh red blood my uterus is sore & i have all my pregnancy symptoms i also bleed again this month & it was spotty for 5 days with cramping around my hips & i was just wondering where or what could be causing the blood?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.It is unclear from your question how you are sure you are pregnant; did you do a urine pregnancy test?  Pregnancy symptoms can vary widely between women and the most common sign of pregnancy is a missed period.  If you have had a positive pregnancy test during this time, bleeding on and off like this can be a sign of miscarriage or an abnormal pregnancy.I suggest you see a GYN doctor who can measure the level of pregnancy hormone in your blood and perform and ultrasound test to make sure the pregnancy is developing normally.I hope I was able to answer your question and best of luck for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi I am 40+3 weeks pregnant and I have been getting very uncomfortable and feeling a lot of pressure on my pelvis and what i think may be braxon hicks.

During my internal examination I was told by my doctor that my cervix is small. Its length is 3.3 cm. The doctor has suggested stitching the cervix For now, I am told to take bed rest and come again after 15 days for examination after which she will decide whether to give the stitch or not. Please tell me if having a small cervix can cause some problem and is stiching/ operation is compulsory. Also what are the risk associated with this condition.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Cervical shortening (it is the length of the cervix that is measured) can be a risk factor for preterm labor as well as preterm delivery.  It should be measured accurately with a transvaginal ultrasound not just with a digital examination.However, the cervical length at which intervention is recommended and where we have real concern is a length of less than 2.5 cm.Cerclage (or placement of a stitch to close the cervix) really should only be performed if the length shortens to less than 2.5 cm.  The procedure itself has some risks including breaking the water at the time of the cerclage and infection of the cervix.However, the most effective treatment currently available to prevent preterm delivery with a short cervix is vaginal progesterone.  This is given as a cream or suppository and does not have the risks associated with cerclage placement.So in summary, I would not recommend any treatment if your cervix is longer than 2.5 cm, as a length of 3.3 is not considered a significant risk factor for preterm birth.  If your cervix shortens to 2.5 cm or less, vaginal progesterone is a safer and more effective means of preventing preterm delivery over cerclage.Furthermore, bedrest has not been shown to prevent preterm delivery in any scientific study, especially in your case as you are still in the second trimester and are not dilated.I hope I was able to effectively answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, I m 34 weeks pregnant and noticed that my urine has been darker than normal for the last couple of days.

The egg is released 14 days prior to the next menses. The egg lives for 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence a week around the day of egg release is a fertile period. If you had unprotected sex during this fertile window, you have got high chances of becoming pregnant. The best indicator of probable pregnancy is missing a period. All other symptoms appear a week or more after that. So if you miss your period, get your urine tested for pregnancy which will guide you.

In such situation, try to adjust your sexual intercourse on and around the day of egg release (ovulation). The egg is released 14 days prior to next menses. The egg has 24 hours life and the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence a period of a week is a fertile window. Intercourse during this period might be helpful to become pregnant. You can find out the day of ovulation by ovulation monitoring kits or ultrasonography ovulation monitoring. The chances of pregnancy will be maximum if you perform sexual intercourse on the day of ovulation. If you do not conceive within six months, you may report to the Gynaecologist for any investigations and interventions needed."},{"Patient":"I am having symptoms of being pregnant.

Please report to your Obstetrician for thorough check up. Ultrasonography will tell you the status of the baby. Urine pregnancy test may misguide you as it takes about 8-10 days for it to become negative after the baby has become non-viable.

Your emotions have no negative effect on the baby, however, I am concerned about your own health and the environment in your home, as your fighting with your husband and chronic lack of sleep is not the best environment for a newborn baby.  It is difficult to not have your husband around a lot to support you.  I really hope that there is no physical violence that takes place as this is a major risk factor for things getting very dangerous, especially once the baby is born.  There is also a possibility you could be suffering from depression, which is a chemical imbalance brought on by stress and the hormones of pregnancy.  There are medications that can be used safely during pregnancy and I strongly suggest you discuss your situation with your healthcare provider.  There are even medications you can safely take to help you sleep.In the meantime, at least you do not have to worry about the effect this has on the baby, but the environment in your home and your mood concerns me for the time after the baby is born.

In the case of someone like you, whose thyroid has been essentially destroyed by RAI, your TSH will frequently be high.But as long as your free T4 is normal (which is the actual level of your circulating thyroid hormone) the baby will receive enough hormone for normal healthy development.So as long as your supplemental thyroid medication is at the correct level, your baby will be fine.  It is more important to monitor your thyroid hormone level by the T4 value, however, rather than the TSH.Your endocrinologist likely will check your level every month or two during the pregnancy as most women need more thyroid hormone as the abay grows.So in summary, there is nothing to be concerned about right now, and under the right care you should absolutely be able to have a healthy pregnancy.I hope this answer was helpful and reassuring.Best wishes fo rthe rest of the pregnancy, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"hi i have tree miss.......ge an i smoke drink ,an my doctor said i must rest or wait on till tree month an after u can do any activite so i want to know, if i take multivitamin ,can it bill my blood an help me to have a baby the next time i get preg...........n yes or no i want to know now.","Doctor":"yes u can get pregnant but it is also important to know all congenital infection which can arise due to your smoking or drinking so be careful"},{"Patient":"hi my partner has been diagnoses as a cystic fibrosis carrier which has affected his fertility and we think that it may have blocked his tubes we have been told that there is ivf treatment avalible for us but we would like to know if there is a chance that we could conceive a child naturally","Doctor":"you can also go for inta uterine insemination technique by collecting and proper washing of sperms,otherwise it is safe to go for ivf"},{"Patient":"Hi I have a dry cough for about 1 week now and it seems to be getting worse. I am 7 months pregnant so I am afraid to take anything thats not natural but its not getting better. I cant sleep the cough gets worse at night. I often cough till I though up because of the force of the cough is so strong, this makes my chest burn. what should I do?","Doctor":"HI,    I understand your concern.    A bout of dry cough is definitely very troublesome.    Dry cough can be allergic or infective( bacterial or viral ) in origin    exposure to allergen ( dust, pollen, fumes).. irritate throat & cause dry cough.  This can be controlled by anti allergic cough syrup like Benadril syrup.        Viral cold followed by cough is common. Starts with common cold, fever & fever. Other symptoms go in 5 days but cough takes long .. it needs cough supressant syrup .      Infective ( bacterial)cough is dry to start with.. & starts producing sputum later. Here antibiotics are needed along with cough expectorant.    * In pregnancy you should consult a physician before taking medicines. After physical examinations & advise for investigations, you will bw prescribed medicines with other medicines ( antibiotic, anti allergic, bronchodialators .. as per need) along with cough syrup of specific type.   * along with the medicines you have to-     - avoid allergens,/ cold drinks, sour food     -hot saline gargles,     - drink plenty of warm water   Thanks."},{"Patient":"i have left the pill (yasmin) going on the third week now. i had withdrawal bleeding lasting 3 days . this happened 3 days after i left the pill.

Moreover, you should get yourself examined by an OBGYN specialist and get appropriate treatment.Hope you found the answer helpful.RegardsDr Deepti Verma"},{"Patient":"HI,Me and my girlfriend had sex a week back but did not indulge in intercourse.

Actually oral contraceptives are to be taken regularly at the same time of day.. to have good contraceptive effect.    You had missed 2 pills at about mid cycle.  You had taken them as soon as remembered. Mostly you will skip the risk.    Oral contraceptives taken for a long time, tends to reduce bleeding. This month late can be due to temporary hormone fluctuation by irregular consumption.     Still to exclude pregnancy you have to go for UPT after 8 days delay in menses.

THe non penetrative sex has zero percent chance of conception.    In your case,      few sperms - entering vagina while fingering.., won't have any possible movement to enter uterus & impregnate.       Pre cum is known to have few sperms which can cause conception. but in the incidence you refer to... it can not pass through two layered garment & enter vagina & cause pregnancy.

It has to be taken ideally within 24 hours but not later than 72 hours of unprotected sex, which you have done both the times. So the probability of pregnancy is very remote. After ipill, the menstrual period does get delayed. Before you got your period, again you have repeated the pill. So your period is bound to get delayed considerably. The white discharge you got is also due to the effect of the hormones. Now, please wait patiently for the menses to appear.

She has a 2 year old at home and her husband is a fireman and he is on his 24 hrs. at the station.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.It is doubtful that your daughter's symptoms are due to a gallbladder problem, since the gallbladder is on the right side of the upper abdomen, and usually the gallbladder only feels pain after eating.However there are many other causes of left abdominal pain, such as gastritis, a stomach flu, kidney stones... And if it is lower abdominal pain, it can be related to the uterus or ovaries.  Her anxiety about the situation probably is also contributing to the problem.So if your daughter is in so much distress she should call her doctor.  There is someone on duty for emergencies even at night for most OB practices.  Her doctor can make a recommendation of whether or not to go to the emergency room or come in for a doctor's appointment.Either way, as this problem has been going on for a few days, she absolutely should be seen by a doctor soon to make a diagnosis.I hope this answer and my advice was helpful.Best wishes to your daughter for the rest of her pregnancy,  Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"mam/sir iam 27 yrs, married, 3 yrs passed. iam having poly cystic ovary. recently i came to about this problem. iam very thin person. i took clomid for 3 months and i started to ovulate, follicles ruptured. when i try ot get pregnant dates are postponed but immidiately iam getting periods after 35 to 38 days. iam regularly menstruating every month.","Doctor":"Hi dear, I have gone through your question and understand your concerns.You should get the patency of the fallopian tubes checked by hysterosalpingography or laparoscopy, before proceeding on further treatment for infertility.If tubes are patent, then you can go for intrauterine insemination with ovulation induction.If the tubes are blocked, then you should go for in vitro fertilization.Hope you found the answer helpful.Wishing you good health.Dr Deepti Verma"},{"Patient":"Hello, I am 19 and i have been having trouble ejaculating and getting an orgasism.

Should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Unfortunately, being pregnant does not prevent you from getting sick just like any other person.Fortunately, you have to have very severe and/or certain types of illnesses to put the baby at risk.  A low-grade fever and some nausea likely is just a stomach flu or some type of food-borne illness and does not pose a threat to the pregnancy.I suggest you start a bland diet with simple, starchy foods and sweet liquids.  Products made from ginger (tea, candies) are soothing to the stomach and can help with nausea, and Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is safe to take at the normal adult dose during pregnancy for pain or fever.Also if you are sick, there is no problem with getting the routine prenatal blood tests as the results are not affected by your illness.I hope I was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy, and I hope you feel better, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I am 22 weeks pregnant and have noticed my face swelling already.

Should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Swelling of the face, hands and legs during pregnancy is normal from water retention during pregnancy, and preeclampsia is extremely rare before term.Regardless of what your baseline blood pressure is, we do not really become concerned unless your systolic pressure is at least 130 and the diastolic is at least 95.So you have a completely healthy blood pressure at this time.Decreasing salt intake and drinking lots of water can help flush out water retention.I hope i was able to answer your question today and that this advice was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I m 38 weeks 2 days pregnant my baby is measuring at 46 weeks she has been large for her dates for about a month. Doctors have done nothing they have said she has still not dropped far enough into my pelvis and with my low placenta it s a risk it could get caught if she does drop but they don t want to do anything yet. Also they reckon she is not in the right position too. They want to wait till after my due date to do something. My question is will she be safe and is it possible that she is to big for my pelvis and that s why she can t drop any further but also is it safe for her to be this big and to carry on waiting despite other risks.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Even though your baby is large for gestational age (LGA) as long as the doctors who are monitoring her and doing her ultrasounds think she is healthy, early induction is not recommended.  There are two reasons for this- for one, natural labor has an increased chance of delivering vaginally compared to induction, even for a large baby, and secondly- babies born before 39 weeks can have respiratory problems if they are delivered electively, so (in the US at least) it is not recommended to deliver before 39 weeks except for situations where the baby is in more danger inside you than out.So even though your daughter is large, as long as she is healthy, it is best for you and her to wait for natural labor.If you have a low-lying placenta, the placenta cannot get \\"caught\\" in the baby's head as it descends in the pelvis, rather, compression of the pelvis by the head can actually prevent bleeding from the edge of the placenta.Now- the question if she is too big for your pelvis can only be known if you go into labor.  The baby's head \\"molds\\", meaning the skull actually changes shape as it descends through the birth canal during labor.  The fact that your baby hasn't droppped yet just means that you are unlikely to go into labor anytime soon.  It is true that if the baby is really too big to enter your pelvis (called inlet dystocia) that she will not drop even in labor and your OB can feel this during labor and if it happens, you will need a c-section.  But in your case, your doctors are correct in waiting until at least 39 weeks to consider intervening.  A large baby is not at increased risk of any problems as long as it is not due to diabetes or other medical problem.  Many women can deliver 9+ pound babies without a problem, so there is no way to know in advance how your delivery will go.I hope this answers your question and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of your pregnancy, and good luck with your delivery,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"HI, Confused if am pregnant or not.One week after ovulation I had a pregnancy test, and it was positive.A week after another test was done and it was negative i.e after a week.
