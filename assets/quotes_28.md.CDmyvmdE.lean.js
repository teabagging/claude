Here's a step-by-step explanation based on the provided solution:1. Express f(x) using a trigonometric identity: We know that a function of the form Asin x + Bcos x can be rewritten as sqrt{A^2+B^2}sin(x+varphi), where tanvarphi = frac{B}{A}. For f(x)=asin omega x-cos omega x, we have sqrt{a^2+1}sin(omega x-varphi), where tan varphi = frac{-1}{a}.      - From tan varphi = frac{-1}{a}, solving for a when varphi = frac{pi}{6} because tan(frac{pi}{6}) = frac{1}{sqrt{3}}. Thus, tan varphi = frac{1}{sqrt{3}} implies a = sqrt{3}.2. Find the maximum value: The maximum value of a sine function sin(x) is 1. Therefore, the maximum value of f(x) is sqrt{a^2+1}.   - Given that the maximum value of f(x) is 2, we solve sqrt{a^2+1} = 2. Squaring both sides gives a^2 + 1 = 4, simplifying to a^2 = 3, and taking the square root gives a = sqrt{3} (we discard a = -sqrt{3} because a > 0).3. Determine omega: For the function to have a line of symmetry at x = frac{pi}{m}, we consider the periodicity and symmetry of the sine function.    - The condition ωx-frac{π}{6}=kπ+frac{π}{2} leads us to frac{ω}{m}π=kπ+frac{2π}{3}, implying that ω = m(k + frac{2}{3}). Since ω and m are positive integers, the smallest value for ω is when m(k + frac{2}{3}) = 2, giving ω = 2 as the smallest integer value satisfying the conditions.4. Count the maximum values within (0,10): The function reaches its maximum when 2x-frac{π}{6}=frac{π}{2}+2kπ. Solving for x gives x = frac{π}{3} + kπ. By testing values of k within the interval (0, 10), we find that k = 0, 1, and 2 give valid x values within the interval, but k = 3 gives x = frac{10π}{3} which is not within (0,10).Therefore, the function f(x) achieves its maximum value 3 times within the interval (0,10).Hence, the answers are: a=boxed{sqrt{3}} and the function f(x) achieves its maximum value boxed{3} times within the interval (0,10)."},{"problem":"A school has a total of 490 teachers, of which 350 are under 40 years of age, and 140 are 40 years or older.

Since no three vertices of a real triangle lie on the same line, at most two of the vertices of the sought triangles can be points on the same one of our lines.Thus, we can categorize the sought triangles into 4 groups:I. All three vertices come from different lines. The selection of these can start in 5 ways by choosing a point from the line e, each of these can be continued in 3 ways by choosing a point from the line f, and the resulting 5 cdot 3 point pairs can be completed in 5 cdot 3 cdot 2=30 ways by considering the possibilities of the points on g.II. Two vertices are from e - that is, one side of the triangle - and the third is from f or g. In this case, the first point from e can be chosen in 5 ways, and the second from the remaining 4 points in 4 ways, so the 5 cdot 4=20 selections, however, represent the same pair of points for the side of the triangle, as we considered AB and BA as well. The side from e can thus be chosen in 20: 2=10 ways, and in each case, the opposite vertex can be chosen from the 3+2=5 points of f and g together, resulting in 5 triangles, a total of 10(3+2)=50 triangles.III. Two vertices are from f. These can be combined in (3 cdot 2): 2=3 ways (alternatively: from the 3 points, we either do not choose the first, or the second, or the third as a vertex), and the number of different triangles is 3(5+2)=21.IV. Two vertices are from g, that is, both g-line points are chosen, and the third from the remaining 5+3=8. Thus, there are 8 different such triangles.No triangle belongs to two groups, so in total, there are 30+50+21+8=109 possible triangles.II. solution. First, we think of all the triplets of points that can be formed from the points, then we remove those that do not form a real triangle because their three points lie on the same line.The first point of the triplet can be chosen in 10 ways, each of these starting points can be continued in 9 ways by choosing from the remaining 9 points, and finally, the remaining points offer 8 possibilities for completion. Thus, we have thought of 10 cdot 9 cdot 8=720 triplets of points.However, not all of these thought triplets represent different triangles, since the vertices of any ABC triangle can be listed in 6 ways:ABC, quad ACB, quad BAC, quad BCA, quad CAB, quad CBAAccordingly, the number of different triplets is 720: 6=120.With the same reasoning, we get the number of triplets whose all three elements lie on the line e: (5 cdot 4 cdot 3): 6=10, similarly, on the line f there is (3 cdot 2 cdot 1): 6=1 triplet to be excluded, and on g there is none.The remaining - and now suitable - triplets, that is, the number of real triangles is 120-(10+1)=109."},{"problem":"14 A school's mathematics extracurricular activity group simulates a desert tree planting plan on coordinate paper as follows: The k-th tree is planted at point P_{k}left(x_{k}, y_{k}right), where x_{1}=1, y_{1}=1, and when k geqslant 2,left{begin{array}{l}x_{k}=x_{k-1}+1-5left[frac{k-1}{5}right]+5left[frac{k-2}{5}right], y_{k}=y_{k-1}+left[frac{k-1}{5}right]-left[frac{k-2}{5}right] .end{array}right.where [a] represents the integer part of the real number a, for example [2.6]=2,[0.6]=0.

(a) Show that all members of ( S_n ) are real.   We will use mathematical induction to show that all members of ( S_n ) are real.   Base Case:   For ( n = 1 ), the set ( S_1 ) consists of the numbers ( 2 pm sqrt{2} ). Clearly, both ( 2 + sqrt{2} ) and ( 2 - sqrt{2} ) are real numbers since ( sqrt{2} ) is real.   Inductive Step:   Assume that for some ( k geq 1 ), all members of ( S_k ) are real and lie in the interval ( (0, 4) ). That is, ( 0 < T(k) < 4 ) for any ( T(k) in S_k ).   We need to show that all members of ( S_{k+1} ) are real. Consider any member of ( S_{k+1} ), which is of the form ( 2 pm sqrt{T(k)} ) where ( T(k) in S_k ).   Since ( 0 < T(k) < 4 ), we have ( 0 < sqrt{T(k)} < 2 ). Therefore, the expressions ( 2 + sqrt{T(k)} ) and ( 2 - sqrt{T(k)} ) are both real and lie in the interval ( (0, 4) ).   Hence, ( 0 < 2 pm sqrt{T(k)} < 4 ), which means all members of ( S_{k+1} ) are real.   By the principle of mathematical induction, all members of ( S_n ) are real for all ( n ).2.

To find the product of the roots of this polynomial, we use the fact that for a polynomial of the form ( P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + ldots + a_1 x + a_0 ), the product of the roots (taken with their multiplicities) is given by ( (-1)^n frac{a_0}{a_n} ).

We will prove that the second statement cannot be true.

If we remove 5 blue balls and 4 red balls from the bag, the number of balls of each color will be the same, specifically, there will be ((15-5-4):3=2) balls of each color.

In our problem, the number we are looking for cannot be a four-digit number or smaller, because from such a number, by rearranging its digits, we can obtain at most 24 different numbers, all of which are less than 10,000. Thus, the sum of these numbers is less than 240,000. Therefore, let's examine the five-digit numbers.If any digit in the number we are looking for appears at least three times, then the number of different numbers that can be obtained by permuting the digits is at most 20, and each of these numbers is less than 100,000. Thus, the sum of these numbers is less than 2,000,000. Therefore, this is also not possible.It is also not possible for two digits to each appear exactly twice, because from such a number, we can obtain 30 different numbers, the sum of which is less than (30 cdot 100000 = 3000000).Therefore, if there is a five-digit number that meets the conditions, then either all its digits are different, or exactly two of its digits are the same.First, let's consider the case where all digits are different. The number is of the form (overline{a b c d e}) (where (a, b, c, d), and (e) are all different digits). In this case, each digit appears 24 times in each place value when the digits are permuted. Thus, the sum of the numbers obtained is:[begin{aligned}& 24 cdot 11111 cdot a + 24 cdot 11111 cdot b + 24 cdot 11111 cdot c + 24 cdot 11111 cdot d + 24 cdot 11111 cdot e = & = 24 cdot 11111 cdot (a + b + c + d + e) = 4933284end{aligned}]from which (2 cdot (a + b + c + d + e) = 37) follows. This is clearly not possible, since the left side is an even number, while the right side is odd.Finally, let's see if there is a five-digit number where exactly two digits are the same and it meets the conditions. Among the permutations of the digits of such a number, there is, for example, one of the form (overline{a a b c d}), where (a, b, c), and (d) are different digits. If we fix one of the (a) digits in any place value, then by permuting the other digits, we get 24 numbers, so the (a) digit appears 24 times in each place value. If we fix any other digit in any place value, then the other digits have 12 different permutations, so each digit different from (a) appears 12 times in each place value.Thus, the sum of the numbers obtained by permuting the digits of the number (overline{a a b c d}) is: (24 cdot 11111 cdot a + 12 cdot 11111 cdot b + 12 cdot 11111 cdot c + 12 cdot 11111 cdot d = 4933284). Therefore, (2a + b + c + d = 37). We can then find the smallest five-digit number that meets this condition by choosing the smallest possible digit for the first place value. This is possible if the other place values have the largest possible digits; according to this, the largest possible digits are: (2 cdot 9 + 8 + 7 = 33), so the digit in the first place value must be 4.Therefore, there is a five-digit number among the five-digit numbers that satisfies the conditions (and among the smaller numbers, there is not), so the smallest such five-digit number is the smallest number we are looking for: 47899."},{"problem":"A4.

We consider the leftmost and rightmost points. The leftmost point allows us to form n-1 midpoints with the remaining points (the x-coordinates of these n-1 midpoints are then distinct since all points have different x-coordinates).

It is largely based on the written course by Igor Kortchemski, available on the POFM website. More specifically, it covers sections 1, 2.1, 2.2, and 2.6 of this course.## First definitions and operations## Definition 1.A function P from mathbb{R} to mathbb{R} is called a polynomial with real coefficients if there exists an integer n geqslant 0 and real numbers a_{0}, a_{1}, ldots, a_{n} such thatP(x)=a_{n} x^{n}+a_{n-1} x^{n-1}+cdots+a_{1} x+a_{0}for all real x.We will see later, in Corollary 5, that, provided we choose n to be minimal, this representation is unique. Once this result is admitted, we can then define the following concepts.## Definition 2.When a_{n} neq 0, we say that- the number n is the degree of P; it is commonly denoted as deg (P);- the numbers a_{0}, a_{1}, ldots, a_{n} are the coefficients of P; the number a_{k} is called the coefficient of degree k of P ;{ }^{1}- the number a_{n} is the leading coefficient of P;- the number a_{0} is the constant coefficient of P; it is thus called because, when P is constant, the only value it takes is a_{0}.When the numbers a_{0}, a_{1}, ldots, a_{n} are all zero, we say that P is the zero polynomial, and we define (somewhat arbitrarily, but this definition will prove practical) its degree as being equal to -infty.Finally, it may happen that we impose other constraints on the coefficients a_{i}. For example, we may be interested in polynomials P for which these coefficients are non-negative or zero; strictly positive; rational; integers; or simply complex numbers, not necessarily real. { }^{2}In general, when mathcal{E} is a set of numbers, we denote by mathcal{E}[X] the set of polynomials whose coefficients belong to mathcal{E}. Thus, mathbb{R}[X] denotes the set of polynomials with real coefficients, and mathbb{Q}[X] the set of polynomials with rational coefficients.In the following, we will use the notations P and P(X), or even a_{n} X^{n}+a_{n-1} X^{n-1}+ cdots+a_{1} X+a_{0} interchangeably to denote this polynomial. However, we strongly advise against using the notation P(x) to denote"},{"problem":"Fredek runs a private hotel. He claims that whenever  n ge 3 guests visit the hotel, it is possible to select two guests that have equally many acquaintances among the other guests, and that also have a common acquaintance or a common unknown among the guests. For which values of  n is Fredek right? (Acquaintance is a symmetric relation.)","solution":"1. Case 1: ( n ) is odd   Suppose ( n ) is odd. By the pigeonhole principle, there are two guests with the same number of acquaintances. Let's denote these two guests as ( A ) and ( B ). If ( A ) and ( B ) do not have a common acquaintance or a common unknown, then each of them must know exactly ( frac{n-2}{2} ) other people. However, since ( n ) is odd, ( frac{n-2}{2} ) is not an integer, which leads to a contradiction. Therefore, Fredek is right for odd ( n ).2. Case 2: ( n ) is even and ( n geq 6 )   Suppose Fredek is wrong for some ( n geq 6 ) even. By the pigeonhole principle, there are two guests, say ( A ) and ( B ), with the same number of acquaintances. Each of them has either ( frac{n}{2} ) or ( frac{n-2}{2} ) acquaintances.    Consider the guests other than ( A ) and ( B ). Among these guests, there must exist two guests, say ( C ) and ( D ), with the same number of acquaintances. Each of ( C ) and ( D ) knows exactly one of ( A ) and ( B ), thus they have either ( frac{n}{2} ) or ( frac{n-2}{2} ) acquaintances.    Similarly, there must exist two more guests, say ( E ) and ( F ), with either ( frac{n}{2} ) or ( frac{n-2}{2} ) acquaintances.    Among the six guests ( A, B, C, D, E, F ), there must exist three guests with the same number of acquaintances (again by the pigeonhole principle). Among these three guests, at least one must be a common acquaintance or a common unknown for the other two. Therefore, Fredek is right for even ( n geq 6 ).3. Case 3: ( n = 4 )   For ( n = 4 ), consider the following configuration:   - Guest ( A ) knows only guest ( B ).   - Guest ( B ) knows guests ( A ) and ( C ).   - Guest ( C ) knows guests ( B ) and ( D ).   - Guest ( D ) knows only guest ( C ).   In this configuration, no two guests have the same number of acquaintances and also have a common acquaintance or a common unknown. Therefore, Fredek is wrong for ( n = 4 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ n geq 3 } ) except ( n = 4 )."},{"problem":"Given i is the imaginary unit, then i^{2016}= （　　）A: 1B: -1C: iD: -i","solution":"Since i^4=1,  then i^{2016}=i^{4times504}=1,  therefore, the correct answer is boxed{A}.

According to the problem, from equation (2) we have left(frac{7}{4}right)^{2}=b^{2}+3 b+frac{9}{4}, which gives b=frac{1}{4}.The geometric meaning of this problem is that the farthest distance from point P to the ellipse is achieved at the lower vertex of the ellipse's minor axis.d=frac{3}{2}+b, b=frac{7}{4}-frac{3}{2}=frac{1}{4} .If we substitute d=frac{7}{4} into equation (2) and convert it into a quadratic equation in y:3 y^{2}+3 y-4 b^{2}+frac{13}{16}=0 text {, }and use the discriminant Delta=9+4 times 3left(4 b^{2}-frac{13}{16}right)=0, we get b= frac{1}{8}.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to place three knights on a chessboard such that the number of squares they attack is maximized. A knight in chess moves in an \\"L\\" shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular, or one square in one direction and then two squares perpendicular. Each knight can attack up to 8 squares, but this number can be reduced if the knight is near the edge of the board or if other knights are placed such that their attack squares overlap.2. Initial Considerations:   - A chessboard has 64 squares (8x8).   - To maximize the number of squares attacked, knights should be placed such that their attack squares overlap as little as possible.   - Knights placed near the center of the board have the maximum potential to attack 8 squares each.3. Optimal Placement:   - The central 4x4 region of the board (squares (3,3) to (6,6)) allows knights to attack the maximum number of squares.   - Placing knights outside this region reduces the number of squares they can attack.4. Coloring Argument:   - The chessboard is colored in a checkerboard pattern with alternating black and white squares.   - By the pigeonhole principle, if all three knights are placed on squares of the same color, at least two knights will be in rows or columns that cause their attack squares to overlap, reducing the total number of unique squares attacked.5. Distribution of Knights:   - To avoid overlap and maximize the number of attacked squares, knights should be placed on squares of different colors.   - There are 4 central black squares: (3,3), (5,5), (4,4), (6,6).   - There are 4 central white squares: (3,5), (5,3), (4,6), (6,4).6. Counting the Ways:   - If two knights are on black squares and one on a white square, there are 4 ways to choose the two black squares and 8 ways to choose the white square, giving (4 times 8 = 32) ways.   - Similarly, if two knights are on white squares and one on a black square, there are 4 ways to choose the two white squares and 8 ways to choose the black square, giving (4 times 8 = 32) ways.7. Total Number of Ways:   - Adding the two cases together, we get (32 + 32 = 64) ways.The final answer is (boxed{64})."},{"problem":"6.

Pairing Terms:   We can pair the terms in the sequence to simplify the calculation. Consider the pairs ((1, 2), (3, 4), ldots, (2021, 2022)). Each pair can be written as:   [   (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + cdots + (2021 - 2022)   ]   Each pair sums to (-1):   [   1 - 2 = -1, quad 3 - 4 = -1, quad ldots, quad 2021 - 2022 = -1   ]2. Summing the Pairs:   There are (1011) pairs in total (since (2022/2 = 1011)).

Ensuring Minimum Positive Value:   We need to ensure that the sum is the minimum positive value. By changing the sign of one term, we can achieve the smallest positive value.

A certain term F_{n} appears in the twin prime sequence if and only if F_{n}-2 and F_{n} are both prime, or F_{n} and F_{n}+2 are both prime.

What is the greatest number of consecutive positive integers all of which are interesting?","solution":"1. Understanding the problem: We need to find the greatest number of consecutive positive integers such that each integer in the sequence is a product of two prime numbers (i.e., each integer is interesting).2. Analyzing the properties of interesting numbers: An interesting number is defined as a product of two prime numbers. For example, (6 = 2 times 3), (15 = 3 times 5), etc.3. Considering the divisibility by 4: Out of any four consecutive positive integers, one of them must be divisible by 4. If a number is divisible by 4, it can only be interesting if it is equal to (2 times 2 = 4). However, this does not help in forming a sequence of four consecutive interesting numbers because 4 is the only number that fits this criterion and it does not extend to other numbers divisible by 4.4. Checking sequences of three consecutive integers: We need to check if there exists a sequence of three consecutive integers where each integer is a product of two primes.    - Consider the sequence (33, 34, 35):     - (33 = 3 times 11)     - (34 = 2 times 17)     - (35 = 5 times 7)      This sequence shows that it is possible to have three consecutive interesting numbers.5. Verifying the impossibility of four consecutive interesting numbers: Since one of any four consecutive integers must be divisible by 4 and the only interesting number divisible by 4 is 4 itself, it is impossible to have four consecutive interesting numbers. This is because other numbers divisible by 4 (e.g., 8, 12, 16, etc.) are not products of two distinct primes.Conclusion:The greatest number of consecutive positive integers all of which are interesting is three.The final answer is (boxed{3})."},{"problem":"1.

Also, m must be a natural number, so 8 divides 2^{n}-m^{3}=7 p^{2}=28, which is a contradiction. Therefore, p must be odd.Cubes of natural numbers when divided by 7 give remainders 0,1,6, while powers of two give periodic remainders 1,2,4. Therefore, m^{3} and 2^{n} must give a remainder of 1 when divided by 7, so n must be divisible by 3. Let n=3 k.Then we have7 p^{2}=2^{3 k}-m^{3}=left(2^{k}-mright)left(2^{2 k}+2^{k} m+m^{2}right)Since p>2 is prime and 2^{k}-m is 49, we have p>7.

Consider the expression:   [   mathcal{C}_a: quad (x_1 + cdots + x_{a-1}) + x_a + (x_{n+a+1} + cdots + x_{n+k-1})    ]   We need to show that there are at least ( k ) distinct sums. 5. Inequality chain:   [   (x_1 + cdots + x_{a-1}) + x_a + (x_{n+a+1} + cdots + x_{n+k-1})    le (x_1 + cdots + x_{a-1}) + x_{a+1} + (x_{n+a+1} + cdots + x_{n+k-1})    le cdots    le (x_1 + cdots + x_{a-1}) + x_{n+a} + (x_{n+a+1} + cdots + x_{n+k-1}).   ]   We see that one of the inequality signs in   [   x_a le x_{a+1} le cdots le x_{n+a}   ]   is strict, so one of the inequality signs in ( mathcal{C}_a ) is strict.6. Combining inequalities:   [   mathcal{D}: quad mathcal{C}_{k-1} le mathcal{C}_{k-2} le cdots le mathcal{C}_1.   ]   Since there is a strict inequality in each individual ( mathcal{C}_a ), the expression ( mathcal{D} ) has at least ( k-1 ) strict inequalities. Thus, it has at least ( k ) distinct values.7. Conclusion: We have at least ( k ) values made from groups of ( k-1 ) coins, so ( D = n+k-1 ) is the least positive integer such that for any ( n )-diverse collection of ( D ) coins, there are at least ( k ) numbers that are ( n )-reachable."},{"problem":"Example 4.

Let's analyze the conclusions based on these observations:1. Finding the Axis of Symmetry and Vertex:   - The axis of symmetry is found using the midpoint formula between the x-coordinates of points with the same y-value, which are (0,-1.5) and (2,-1.5). Thus, the axis of symmetry is x = frac{0 + 2}{2} = 1.   - Given the axis of symmetry and the y-value of the vertex being the minimum value among the given points, the vertex of the graph is at (1, -2). This implies the quadratic function can be rewritten in the vertex form y = a(x-1)^{2} - 2. Therefore, conclusion ① is correct.2. Determining the Direction of Opening:   - Since the vertex (1, -2) represents the minimum value of the function and the function's values increase as x moves away from 1, the graph opens upwards. This contradicts conclusion ②, which suggests the graph opens downwards. Therefore, conclusion ② is incorrect.3. Identifying the Roots of the Quadratic Equation:   - The given points (0, -1.5) and (2, -1.5) lie on the graph of the quadratic function. Setting y = -1.5 gives us the equation ax^{2} + bx + c = -1.5. Adding 1.5 to both sides yields ax^{2} + bx + c + 1.5 = 0. Since x = 0 and x = 2 satisfy this equation, they are the roots of the quadratic equation ax^{2} + bx + c + 1.5 = 0. Thus, conclusion ③ is correct.4. Analyzing the Condition y > 0:   - The graph passes through (-1, 0) and, by symmetry about the axis x = 1, it also passes through (3, 0). Since the graph opens upwards and these points are on the graph, for y > 0, x must be either greater than 3 or less than -1. This analysis does not fully support conclusion ④, which states that if y > 0, then x > 3 without considering x < -1. Therefore, conclusion ④ is not entirely correct based on the given information.In summary, the correct conclusions based on the given information and analysis are ① and ③.

Base Case:   - The first term of the sequence is 2. We need to find ( r ) such that the first term is ( 2 ) if and only if ( n = 1 + lfloor r cdot 0 rfloor ).   - For ( m = 0 ), ( n = 1 + lfloor r cdot 0 rfloor = 1 ). This is true since the first term is indeed 2.2. Inductive Step:   - Assume that the ( m )-th 2 appears at the position ( 1 + lfloor (2 + sqrt{3})(m-1) rfloor ).   - We need to show that the ((m+1))-th 2 appears at the position ( 1 + lfloor (2 + sqrt{3})m rfloor ).3. Position of the ( m )-th 2:   - By the induction hypothesis, the ( m )-th 2 appears at position ( 1 + lfloor (2 + sqrt{3})(m-1) rfloor ).4. Number of 3's between successive 2's:   - The sequence records the number of 3's between successive 2's. If the ( m )-th 2 is at position ( 1 + lfloor (2 + sqrt{3})(m-1) rfloor ), then the number of 3's between the ( m )-th 2 and the ((m+1))-th 2 is given by the difference in their positions minus 1.5. Position of the ((m+1))-th 2:   - The ((m+1))-th 2 should appear at position ( 1 + lfloor (2 + sqrt{3})m rfloor ).   - We need to show that the number of 3's between the ( m )-th 2 and the ((m+1))-th 2 is consistent with the sequence.6. Calculation:   - Let ( r = 2 + sqrt{3} ).   - The position of the ( m )-th 2 is ( 1 + lfloor r(m-1) rfloor ).   - The position of the ((m+1))-th 2 is ( 1 + lfloor rm rfloor ).   - The number of 3's between the ( m )-th 2 and the ((m+1))-th 2 is ( lfloor rm rfloor - lfloor r(m-1) rfloor - 1 ).7. Consistency Check:   - The sequence of 3's between successive 2's should match the original sequence.   - By the properties of the floor function and the irrationality of ( r ), the difference ( lfloor rm rfloor - lfloor r(m-1) rfloor ) will be either 2 or 3, which matches the given sequence.8.

For example, if we consider the 2 times 3 rectangle A_{5-7,4-5}, it would force either A_{7,4} or A_{7,5} to be black, which would result in 3 black squares in the 2 times 3 rectangle A_{6-7,4-6}, contradicting the given condition.5. Conclusion:   Therefore, the 3 times 3 central square must contain exactly 3 black squares. Since the rest of the grid is covered by 2 times 3 and 3 times 2 rectangles, each containing 2 black squares, we can calculate the total number of black squares as follows:   [   text{Total number of black squares} = 24 + 3 = 27   ]   where 24 is the number of black squares in the 2 times 3 and 3 times 2 rectangles covering the rest of the grid, and 3 is the number of black squares in the central 3 times 3 square.The final answer is boxed{27}"},{"problem":"The following statements are given:① The three interior angles of an equilateral triangle are all equal;② Each angle of an equilateral triangle is 60^{circ};③ A triangle with all three angles equal is an equilateral triangle;④ An isosceles triangle with one angle of 60^{circ} is an equilateral triangle. The number of correct statements is ()A: 1B: 2C: 3D: 4","solution":"To analyze the given statements about triangles, we proceed as follows:① The three interior angles of an equilateral triangle are all equal. This statement is correct because, by definition, an equilateral triangle has all sides of equal length, which implies that all interior angles are equal as well. In an equilateral triangle, due to the property of triangles having interior angles summing up to 180^{circ}, each angle must be equal to frac{180^{circ}}{3} = 60^{circ}. Therefore, the statement accurately describes a property of equilateral triangles.② Each angle of an equilateral triangle is 60^{circ}. This statement directly follows from the explanation above. Since all sides of an equilateral triangle are equal, all angles must be equal, and because the sum of angles in any triangle is 180^{circ}, each angle in an equilateral triangle is indeed 60^{circ}. Hence, this statement is correct.③ A triangle with all three angles equal is an equilateral triangle. This statement is also correct. If all three angles in a triangle are equal, each angle must be 60^{circ} because the total sum of angles in a triangle is 180^{circ}. A triangle with all angles equal to 60^{circ} must also have all sides of equal length to maintain these equal angles, making it an equilateral triangle.④ An isosceles triangle with one angle of 60^{circ} is an equilateral triangle. This statement is correct under the condition that the isosceles triangle has one angle of 60^{circ}. In an isosceles triangle, at least two sides are of equal length. If one of the angles is 60^{circ}, and considering the property of isosceles triangles where angles opposite to equal sides are equal, it implies that the other two angles must also be 60^{circ} for the triangle to maintain its isosceles property. This would make all three angles equal to 60^{circ}, and thus, the triangle would also be equilateral.Given the analysis above, all four statements are correct. Therefore, the number of correct statements is:boxed{D}"},{"problem":"Example 5 Given that the area of square A B C D is 35 square centimeters, E and F are points on sides A B and B C respectively, A F and C E intersect at G, and the area of triangle A B F is 5 square centimeters, the area of triangle B C E is 14 square centimeters.

Since the circle is tangent to the line 2x + y + 1 = 0, the distance d from the center to the line is equal to the radius r of the circle.Using a > 0, we have d = frac{2a + frac{2}{a} + 1}{sqrt{5}} geq frac{4+1}{sqrt{5}} = sqrt{5}. Equality holds if and only if 2a = frac{2}{a}, which implies that a = 1.Thus, the center of the circle is (1, 2), and the minimum radius is sqrt{5}. The desired equation of the circle is (x-1)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 5.Therefore, the answer is boxed{(x-1)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 5}.To solve this problem, first determine the coordinates of the circle's center using the given curve. Then, use the fact that the circle is tangent to the line to establish that the distance from the center to the line is equal to the radius. To minimize the area of the circle, minimize its radius. Use the formula for distance between a point and a line to express the distance d in terms of a. Finally, use basic inequalities to find the minimum value of d and the corresponding value of a.

Compute the square of the largest possible length of the space diagonal of one of the smaller boxes.[i]2020 CCA Math Bonanza Lightning Round #2.2[/i]","solution":"1. We start with a rectangular box with side lengths (1), (2), and (16). We need to cut this box into two congruent smaller boxes with integer side lengths.2. To achieve this, we can cut the original box along one of its dimensions. We have three possible ways to cut the box:   - Cut along the side of length (1), resulting in two boxes with dimensions (0.5 times 2 times 16). However, these dimensions are not integers.   - Cut along the side of length (2), resulting in two boxes with dimensions (1 times 1 times 16).   - Cut along the side of length (16), resulting in two boxes with dimensions (1 times 2 times 8).3. We now need to compute the space diagonal of each of the smaller boxes. The space diagonal (d) of a box with side lengths (a), (b), and (c) is given by:   [   d = sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}   ]4. For the box with dimensions (1 times 1 times 16):   [   d = sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 16^2} = sqrt{1 + 1 + 256} = sqrt{258}   ]   The square of the space diagonal is:   [   d^2 = 258   ]5. For the box with dimensions (1 times 2 times 8):   [   d = sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + 8^2} = sqrt{1 + 4 + 64} = sqrt{69}   ]   The square of the space diagonal is:   [   d^2 = 69   ]6.

Therefore, any pair of non-talking participants must include A or B.Suppose A did not talk to anyone besides B, whom we will call C. Consider quartets of the form A, B, C, D, where D is each of the other politicians. Since A did not talk to B and did not talk to C, in each such quartet, D must have talked to all the others. Thus, A and B must have talked to everyone except C. Therefore, the only unheld talks could be between B and C, which does not contradict the condition.

To find the number of trailing zeros in the decimal representation of ( n! ), we use the formula:   [   leftlfloor frac{n}{5} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{25} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{125} rightrfloor + cdots   ]   This formula counts the number of factors of 5 in ( n! ), which determines the number of trailing zeros.2. We are given that the number of trailing zeros in ( n! ) is exactly ( n - 48 ). Therefore, we need to solve:   [   leftlfloor frac{n}{5} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{25} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{125} rightrfloor + cdots = n - 48   ]3. To approximate the number of trailing zeros, we can use the geometric series:   [   frac{n}{5} + frac{n}{25} + frac{n}{125} + cdots   ]   This series sums to:   [   frac{n}{4}   ]   Therefore, we approximate:   [   frac{n}{4} approx n - 48   ]4.

We need ( n - 48 ) to be the number of trailing zeros. Since ( 64 - 14 = 50 ), we need to decrease ( n ) to get the correct number of trailing zeros.

The total number of main stems, branches, and small branches is 91. If each branch grows x small branches, then x=______.","solution":"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, following the information given and adhering to the rules:1. Setting up the equation: The problem states that there is one main stem, and each branch that comes off the main stem grows the same number of small branches. If we let x represent the number of small branches that grow from each branch, then the total number of branches that each main stem grows is also x. This is because the problem implies a symmetry in the growth pattern. Therefore, the total number of main stems, branches, and small branches can be represented as 1 (for the main stem) + x (for the branches off the main stem) + x^2 (since each of the x branches grows x small branches). This gives us the equation:[x^2 + x + 1 = 91]2. Solving the equation: To find the value of x, we need to solve the quadratic equation x^2 + x + 1 = 91. Subtracting 91 from both sides to set the equation to 0, we get:[x^2 + x - 90 = 0]Factoring this equation, we look for two numbers that multiply to -90 and add to 1. These numbers are 10 and -9, but since we're dealing with a quadratic equation, we apply the quadratic formula or factorization method. In this case, the equation factors as:[(x + 10)(x - 9) = 0]Setting each factor equal to 0 gives us the possible solutions for x:[x + 10 = 0 quad text{or} quad x - 9 = 0][x = -10 quad text{or} quad x = 9]3.

In the first year of these six consecutive years, we call the age of grandma g and that of Sofie s. Then g is divisible by s, and also g-s is then divisible by s. In the following year, the age of grandma is g+1 and that of Sofie s+1. Then g+1 is divisible by s+1, but (g+1)-(s+1)=g-s is also divisible by s+1. The year after that, the age of grandma is g+2 and that of Sofie s+2. Then g+2 is divisible by s+2 and also (g+2)-(s+2)=g-s is divisible by s+2.If we continue for three more years, we find that g-s is divisible by the consecutive numbers s, s+1, s+2, s+3, s+4 and s+5. If the numbers 5, 6, and 7 are included, then g-s would be at least 5 cdot 6 cdot 7=210 and grandma would thus be more than 210 years old. That is impossible. If s is at least 6 (so that 5 is no longer included) and at most 9, then you have the numbers 9, 10, and 11, and grandma would be more than 990 years old. If s is at least 10 and at most 13, then you have 13, 14, and 15, and grandma would have to be even older. And so on. The only realistic option is therefore to take s=1, so that the numbers are from 1 to 6. (Note that s=0 is not possible, because then both Sofie and grandma would be 0 years old.) Now g-s must be at least a multiple of 5 cdot 6=30. That is not divisible by 4, so g-s must even be a multiple of 60. Indeed, that is divisible by the numbers from 1 to 6. (This is actually the least common multiple of these numbers.) We conclude that g-s=60, because if g-s=120 or a larger multiple of 60, then grandma would be inhumanly old.Since g-s=60 and s=1, grandma is 61 years old and Sofie is 1 in the first year. Indeed, 61 is a multiple of 1. Further, 62 is a multiple of 2, 63 is a multiple of 3, 64 is a multiple of 4, 65 is a multiple of 5, and 66 is a multiple of 6. In the seventh year, we get 67, which is not a multiple of 7. In the two years after that, we get 68 and 69, which are not multiples of 8 and 9, respectively.

Must P be constant?(A [i]Fibonacci number[/i] is an element of the sequence F_0, F_1, dots defined recursively by F_0=0, F_1=1, and F_{k+2} = F_{k+1}+F_k for kge 0.)[i]Nikolai Beluhov[/i]","solution":"To determine whether the polynomial ( P ) must be constant, we will use properties of Fibonacci numbers and polynomial behavior. Let's break down the solution step by step.1. Lemma 1: Fibonacci numbers are surjective modulo ( 9 )   This means that for every integer ( k ) from ( 0 ) to ( 8 ), there exists a Fibonacci number ( F_i ) such that ( F_i equiv k pmod{9} ). This property is crucial because it implies that any residue class modulo ( 9 ) can be represented by some Fibonacci number.2. Lemma 2: Constructing a polynomial ( Q ) such that ( P(Q(x)) ) has ( x^{3n-1} ) as its only negative coefficient   Let ( n ) be the degree of ( P ). We need to construct a polynomial ( Q ) such that when composed with ( P ), the resulting polynomial ( P(Q(x)) ) has a specific form. Consider the polynomial ( Q(x) = x^3 + x + 1 ). For ( P(x) = x^n ), ( P(Q(x)) = (x^3 + x + 1)^n ). The term ( x^{3n-1} ) will have a coefficient that is not zero. By adjusting constants ( C ) and ( D ) in ( Q(x) = C(Dx^3 - x^2 + Dx + D) ), we can ensure that the ( x^{3n-1} ) term is isolated and significant.3. Analyzing the sum of decimal digits of ( |P(Q(10^k))| )   For sufficiently large ( k ), consider ( P(Q(10^k)) ). The polynomial ( Q(10^k) ) will produce a large number, and the sum of its decimal digits will be influenced primarily by the term ( x^{3n-1} ). As ( k ) increases, the sum of the decimal digits of ( |P(Q(10^k))| ) will increase by ( 9 ) for each increment in ( k ). This means that the sum of the decimal digits can take on values of the form ( 9a + b ) for some fixed ( b ) and sufficiently large ( a ).4. Using the periodicity of Fibonacci numbers modulo ( 9 )   Since Fibonacci numbers are surjective modulo ( 9 ), any residue class modulo ( 9 ) can be represented by a Fibonacci number. Therefore, if the sum of the decimal digits of ( |P(n)| ) is never a Fibonacci number, it implies that the polynomial ( P ) must be such that the sum of the decimal digits of ( |P(n)| ) avoids all residue classes modulo ( 9 ). This is impossible unless ( P ) is constant, as a non-constant polynomial would eventually produce sums of decimal digits that cover all residue classes modulo ( 9 ).Conclusion:Since the sum of the decimal digits of ( |P(n)| ) must avoid all Fibonacci numbers, and Fibonacci numbers cover all residue classes modulo ( 9 ), the polynomial ( P ) must be constant.The final answer is ( boxed{text{yes}} )"},{"problem":"A rectangular parking lot has a diagonal of 25 meters and an area of 168 square meters.

Define the problem and variables:   - We have a (30 times 30) table.   - There are 162 pluses and 144 minuses.   - Each row and each column contains at most 17 signs.   - We need to find the maximum sum (S) of the counts of minuses in the rows of pluses and pluses in the columns of minuses.2. Calculate the total number of cells:   [   30 times 30 = 900   ]   Since there are 162 pluses and 144 minuses, the total number of signs is:   [   162 + 144 = 306   ]   This means 594 cells are empty.3. Constraints on rows and columns:   Each row and each column can have at most 17 signs. Therefore, the maximum number of signs in any row or column is 17.4. Arrangement strategy:   Consider an (18 times 18) square with the top left to bottom right diagonal empty. This means there are (18 times 18 - 18 = 306) cells available for signs, which matches the total number of signs we have.5. Placing the pluses and minuses:   - Arrange the 162 pluses in two (9 times 9) squares, one in the top right corner and one in the bottom left corner.   - Fill the remaining cells in the (18 times 18) square with minuses.6. Verify the arrangement:   - Each row and each column in the (18 times 18) square has exactly 17 signs.   - Each row and each column has 9 pluses and 8 minuses.7. Count the contributions to (S):   - For each minus, count the number of pluses in its row. Each minus sees 9 pluses in its row.   - For each plus, count the number of minuses in its column. Each plus sees 8 minuses in its column.8. Calculate the total sum (S):   - Each of the 144 minuses counts 9 pluses:     [     144 times 9 = 1296     ]   - Each of the 162 pluses counts 8 minuses:     [     162 times 8 = 1296     ]   - Therefore, the total sum (S) is:     [     S = 1296 + 1296 = 2592     ]9. Conclusion:   The maximum value of (S) is (2592).The final answer is (boxed{2592})."},{"problem":"## Task 7 / 71Let p_{n} be the n-th prime number.

Establish the Maximum Number of Dominant Pairs:   - The number of dominant pairs is equal to the number of ordered pairs of players ( X ) and ( Y ) in which ( X ) dominates ( Y ).3. Prove Each Player Can Dominate at Most One Other Player:   - Suppose a player ( A ) dominates both players ( B ) and ( C ). This means ( A ) defeats both ( B ) and ( C ).   - Since ( A ) dominates ( B ), ( B ) must defeat ( C ). Similarly, since ( A ) dominates ( C ), ( C ) must defeat ( B ).   - This leads to a contradiction because ( B ) cannot both defeat and be defeated by ( C ). Therefore, each player can dominate at most one other player.4. Consider the Case Where Each Player Dominates Exactly One Other Player:   - Choose a player ( Q_1 ). For each ( i ), let ( Q_{i+1} ) be the player who ( Q_i ) dominates.   - Since there are a finite number of players, eventually we will find a pair ((x, y)) for which ( Q_x = Q_y ).   - This implies there exist some players ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_k ) such that ( P_{i+1} ) dominates ( P_i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k ) and ( P_{k+1} = P_1 ).5. Prove by Induction That ( P_n ) Defeats ( P_1 ) for All ( n leq k ):   - Base case: ( n = 2 ). Since ( P_2 ) dominates ( P_1 ), ( P_2 ) defeats ( P_1 ).   - Inductive step: Suppose for some ( i ) that ( P_i ) defeats ( P_1 ). Since ( P_{i+1} ) dominates ( P_i ) and ( P_i ) defeats ( P_1 ), ( P_{i+1} ) must also defeat ( P_1 ).   - By induction, ( P_k ) must defeat ( P_1 ). However, ( P_1 ) dominates ( P_k ), leading to a contradiction.6.

On a plane, a square is drawn, with its sides horizontal and vertical. Several segments parallel to the sides are drawn inside it, such that no two segments lie on the same line and do not intersect at a point that is internal for both segments. It turns out that the segments divide the square into rectangles, and any vertical line intersecting the square and not containing segments of the partition intersects exactly k rectangles of the partition, while any horizontal line intersecting the square and not containing segments of the partition intersects exactly ell rectangles. What could be the number of rectangles in the partition?","solution":"Answer. k ell.First solution. Take a horizontal line h passing through the top side of the square, and move it downwards. Consider the moment when it passes through some segment I of the partition (by the condition, such a segment is unique at this moment; let a rectangles be adjacent to it from above and b from below). The number of rectangles intersected by h at this moment decreases by a and increases by b; since it should not change, we get that a=b.Now let's prove that the number of rectangles is k ell, by induction on k. If k=1, the statement is obvious. Suppose now k>1. Consider all the rectangles of the partition adjacent to the bottom side of the square; there are ell of them, because a horizontal line passing close enough to this side intersects exactly them. Divide them into groups of consecutive rectangles of equal height (see Fig. 6). The upper boundary of each such group is one segment.Consider one such group with the upper segment I. Note that the vertical segments bounding this group continue above I. Indeed, otherwise, say, the upper end of the left vertical segment J lies on I; then to the right of J there is one rectangle, and to the left - more than one (since J is a boundary for the group). This is impossible.Remove this group, and \\"extend\\" the rectangles lying above I to the bottom side of the square. Since the same number of rectangles are adjacent to I from above and below, any horizontal line will still intersect ell rectangles.Perform this operation with each group (see Fig. 7). We will remove exactly ell rectangles; meanwhile, each vertical line will intersect one rectangle less than before, that is, k-1 rectangles. By the induction hypothesis, the total number of rectangles will become (k-1) ell, which means that before the reconstruction it was (k-1) ell + ell = k ell, as required.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_8b5e293e563ce6c828ceg-4.jpg?height=183&width=315&top_left_y=840&top_left_x=236)Fig. 6![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_8b5e293e563ce6c828ceg-4.jpg?height=183&width=327&top_left_y=840&top_left_x=593)Fig. 7![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_8b5e293e563ce6c828ceg-4.jpg?height=196&width=324&top_left_y=838&top_left_x=949)Fig. 8Second solution. Consider any rectangle P of the partition and a vertical line v intersecting it (not containing a segment of the partition). Let v intersect i-1 rectangles of the partition lying above P; in this case, we say that P has a vertical number i on the line v. Similarly, define the horizontal number of the rectangle P on a horizontal line intersecting it.Consider any horizontal segment I of the partition and move the vertical line v intersecting I from left to right. Consider the moment when v contains some segment of the partition (lying above or below I). As shown at the beginning of the previous solution, the same number of rectangles are adjacent to this segment from both sides. Therefore, the vertical number of any rectangle P adjacent to I does not change at this moment; moreover, the numbers of adjacent rectangles on the same side of I are equal, and for those adjacent on different sides, it differs by 1. Thus, any rectangle P has the same number on all vertical lines containing it. Similar statements are true for horizontal numbers.Now fix a number i and consider all rectangles P_{1}, ldots, P_{x} having a vertical number i (let them be numbered according to the abscissas of their left boundaries from left to right). Move the vertical line v from the left side of the square to the right. At each moment (except those when it contains a segment of the partition), v intersects exactly one of the rectangles P_{s}; therefore, the right side of the next rectangle P_{s+1} lies on the same line as the left side of the previous rectangle P_{s} (see Fig. 8). Then these rectangles are adjacent to the same vertical segment of the partition from different sides, so the horizontal number of the rectangle P_{s+1} is 1 more than the horizontal number of P_{s}. It is clear, finally, that the horizontal numbers of the rectangles P_{1} and P_{x} are 1 and ell; therefore, x=ell.Thus, for each of the k vertical numbers, there are exactly ell rectangles with that number; therefore, the total number of rectangles is k ell.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_8b5e293e563ce6c828ceg-5.jpg?height=216&width=474&top_left_y=1158&top_left_x=513)Fig. 9Remark.

Xiao Liang, who did not participate initially, later scored 30 sit-ups in a makeup test. We are to determine the impact of Xiao Liang's score on the average and variance of the sit-ups done by the class.1. Understanding the Average Calculation:   The average number of sit-ups done by the 47 students is 30. Xiao Liang's score is also 30 sit-ups, which is equal to the average of the other students.   - The total number of sit-ups done by the 47 students is 47 times 30.   - Adding Xiao Liang's score, the total number of sit-ups becomes 47 times 30 + 30.   - The total number of students is now 48.   Therefore, the new average is calculated as:   [   text{New Average} = frac{47 times 30 + 30}{48} = frac{48 times 30}{48} = 30   ]2. Understanding the Variance Calculation:   The variance of the 47 students' scores is 15. Variance measures the average of the squared differences from the Mean. Since Xiao Liang's score is exactly the mean of the other scores, adding his score to the dataset does not change the sum of the squared differences from the mean.   However, the formula for variance is:   [   text{Variance} = frac{sum (x_i - mu)^2}{n}   ]   where x_i are the data points, mu is the mean, and n is the number of data points.   - Before Xiao Liang's score was added, n = 47.   - After adding his score, n = 48.   Since the sum of the squared differences (x_i - mu)^2 remains unchanged but the denominator n increases from 47 to 48, the variance decreases.3. Conclusion:   Since the average number of sit-ups remains the same (30 sit-ups) and the variance decreases due to the increase in the total number of students (from 47 to 48) without changing the sum of the squared differences, the correct option is:   [   boxed{D}   ]   The average number remains the same, and the variance decreases."},{"problem":"Given alpha in (0, frac{pi}{2}) and beta in (frac{pi}{2}, pi), with cosbeta = -frac{1}{3} and sin(alpha + beta) = frac{4 - sqrt{2}}{6}.- (I) Find the value of tan 2beta;- (II) Find the value of alpha.","solution":"(The full score for this question is 14 points)Solution:(I) Since beta in (frac{pi}{2}, pi) and cosbeta = -frac{1}{3}, we can find that sinbeta = sqrt{1 - cos^2beta} = frac{2sqrt{2}}{3}...2 pointsTherefore, tanbeta = frac{sinbeta}{cosbeta} = frac{frac{2sqrt{2}}{3}}{-frac{1}{3}} = -2sqrt{2}...4 pointsThus, tan 2beta = frac{2tanbeta}{1 - tan^2beta} = frac{4sqrt{2}}{7}...7 points(II) Since alpha in (0, frac{pi}{2}) and beta in (frac{pi}{2}, pi),Therefore, alpha + beta in (frac{pi}{2}, frac{3pi}{2}),Given that sin(alpha + beta) = frac{4 - sqrt{2}}{6},Thus, cos(alpha + beta) = -sqrt{1 - sin^2(alpha + beta)} = -frac{4 + sqrt{2}}{6}...9 pointsTherefore, cosalpha = cos(alpha + beta - beta) = cos(alpha + beta)cosbeta + sin(alpha + beta)sinbeta = left(frac{4 + sqrt{2}}{6}right) times left(-frac{1}{3}right) + frac{2sqrt{2}}{3} times left(frac{4 - sqrt{2}}{6}right) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2},Since alpha in (0, frac{pi}{2}),Therefore, alpha = frac{pi}{4}...14 pointsThe final answers are boxed{frac{4sqrt{2}}{7}} for (I) and boxed{frac{pi}{4}} for (II)."},{"problem":"Example 2 Find sum_{0}^{1000}left[frac{1}{3} times 2^{i}right].

When a^{prime} cdot b^{prime} equiv 2(bmod 3), consider the following 3 sets:A_{i}{n mid n=k r+t, 0 leqslant t leqslant r-1, and k equiv i(bmod 3)}(i=1,2,3), then the set of natural numbers is partitioned into 3 sets A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}.Next, prove that this partition satisfies the condition.Let n=k r+t quad(0 leqslant t leqslant r-1),then n+a=left(k+a^{prime}right) r+t, n+b=left(k+b^{prime}right) r+t.Since a^{prime} b^{prime} equiv 2(bmod 3). Therefore, 0, a^{prime}, b^{prime} form a complete residue system modulo 3, so k, k+a^{prime}, k+b^{prime} form a complete residue system modulo 3, so n, n+a, n+b are in different subsets.Next, prove necessity.

Hence, the line intersects both coordinate axes, making statement A correct.- Statement B: If A=0, the line equation simplifies to By+C=0.

Each player earned a different number of points. The player who won the second prize earned as many points as the last four placed players combined. What was the result of the match between the 3rd and 7th place players?","solution":"I. solution. Each player played 7 matches, so the first place could have a maximum of 7 points (as is customary, each match counts for 1 point), and the second place could have a maximum of 6. If the second place had 6.5 points, that is, only a 0.5 point loss compared to the possibility, then they would have scored at least 0.5 points in their match against the first place, and thus the first place could not have achieved 7 points; their point totals would be equal, which contradicts the conditions of the problem.On the other hand, the second place had at least 6 points, as it was the same as the total points of the 5th to 8th places, and among the latter, the 6 points from the 6 matches played among themselves (5th-6th, 5th-7th, 5th-8th, 6th-7th, 6th-8th, 7th-8th) are certainly included. Therefore, the point total of the second place and the combined point total of the 5th to 8th places are exactly 6, so the latter did not score a single point against the 1st to 4th places, which means the 3rd place won the match in question.text { László Németh (Győr, Benedek-rendi Czuczor G. g. II. o. t.) }II. solution. We saw in the first solution that the second player could have a maximum of 6 points. We will show that it cannot be less. The total points are 28 (since the total points are the same regardless of how each match ends; if, for example, every match ends in a draw, then each player's point total is 7 cdot 0.5 = 3.5, and the total points are 8 times that). If the second player had only 5.5 points, then the 5th to 8th players together would also have 5.5 points, and the third would have a maximum of 5, and the fourth a maximum of 4.5 points. Together, this would be a maximum of 20.5 points, so the first would have at least 7.5 points, which is not possible.Let's see if and how many points the third player could have lost to the seventh. The first player has 6.5 or 7 points, the second has 6, and the 5th to 8th together have 6, so the third and fourth together have 9.5 or 9 points. More points go to the third than to the fourth, so the third has at least 5 points, and at most 5.5 points. Thus, the third could end with a maximum of 2 points lost, and if they lost at least 0.5 points to the seventh, they could have lost a maximum of 1.5 more points, and they had to win at least 0.5 points against the first and second.The first either won or drew against the second. In the former case, the second won against everyone else, so the third could only win the mentioned at least 0.5 points from the first (and only in a draw), and the fourth had to lose to the first, the second, and the third. In the latter case, the first could not lose more points, so the third could only draw with the second. In this case, too, all three had to win against the fourth, as they could not lose more points.In both cases, we found that the first has 6.5 points, the second has 6, the 5th to 8th have the same, the third has 5, and the fourth has at most 4. This would be a maximum of 27.5 points together, which is not possible. Therefore, the third place must have won against the seventh (and it also follows that the 5th to 8th place players each lost to the third).Note. Several people examined what possibilities there are for the second player to lose 1 point. This required them to try many more possibilities, but it also turned out that the third place must have won the match against the seventh in every case."},{"problem":"[Example 3.2.5] Let x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{n} take values in some interval of length 1, and letbegin{array}{l}x=frac{1}{n} sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{j}, y=frac{1}{n} sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{j}^{2} .end{array}Find the maximum value of f=y-x^{2}.","solution":"We first calculate f=y-x^{2}.

By definition, a set A is a subset of a set B, denoted A subseteq B, if every element of A is also an element of B.

Therefore, statement B, asserting varnothing subseteq {0}, is correct.- For statement C, we evaluate whether {a,b} is a subset of {b,a}. A set is always a subset of itself regardless of the order of its elements because the subset relation is only concerned with the presence of elements, not their order.

Define the edge sets:   - Let ( B ), ( R ), and ( G ) be the number of blue, red, and green edges, respectively.3. Establish connectivity conditions:   - If any one company cancels all its flights, the remaining graph (formed by the other two companies' edges) must still be connected.   - This implies that removing all red edges leaves a connected graph, so the subgraph formed by blue and green edges must be connected. Therefore, ( B + G geq 14 ) (since a connected graph with 15 vertices must have at least 14 edges).   - Similarly, removing all blue edges leaves a connected graph, so ( R + G geq 14 ).   - Removing all green edges leaves a connected graph, so ( B + R geq 14 ).4.

The pairing is as follows: the pair of any given order is the one obtained by swapping Dömötör and Elek in it.

Find the minimum number of good permutations.[Analysis] According to the definition of a good permutation, for k= 1,2, cdots, n, we need sum_{i=1}^{k} b_{i}>0.Therefore, the fewer positive numbers in a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{n}, the fewer choices there are for the first few terms in the sequence b_{1}, b_{2}, cdots, b_{n}, and thus the total number of good permutations might be smaller. The most extreme case is when there is only one positive number in a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{n}.","solution":"Let a_{1}>0, a_{2}, a_{3}, cdots, a_{n} all be less than 0. In this case, it is easy to see that a good permutation must have a_{1} in the first position, and the order of the last n-1 positions a_{2}, a_{3}, cdots, a_{n} is not required. Therefore, the number of good permutations is (n-1)!.To prove: (n-1)! is the minimum number of good permutations.For convenience, we generalize the definition of a good permutation in the problem. If for i=1,2, cdots, k, we have sum_{j=1}^{i} a_{j}>0, then the permutation a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{k}(k leqslant n) is called a \\"k-element good permutation\\".It is easy to see that the good permutation required in the problem is an n-element good permutation. The good permutations mentioned below include any k-element good permutations.For any a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{n} that satisfy the conditions, place a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{n} on a circle, and the number of circular permutations is (n-1)!. We only need to prove: For any circular permutation, there is at least one corresponding n-element good permutation, and different circular permutations correspond to different n-element good permutations.Let a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{n} have a circular permutation c_{1}, c_{2}, cdots, c_{n} (with the convention c_{n+i}=c_{i}). Consider the set A of all good permutations generated by the circular permutation c_{1}, c_{2}, cdots, c_{n} (a positive number is a one-element good permutation, so this set is non-empty). Since A is a finite set, according to the extreme principle, take the longest good permutation in it, and assume that this good permutation is an l-element good permutation c_{1}, c_{2}, cdots, c_{l}. We want to prove l=n.(1) If l=n, then the conclusion is proved.(2) If l < n, thenbegin{array}{l}sum_{j=1}^{l} c_{j}>0 Rightarrow c_{l+1}+c_{l+2}+cdots+c_{n}<0 Rightarrow c_{l+2}+c_{l+3}+cdots+c_{n}>0 .end{array}Let t be the smallest t such that c_{t}+c_{t+1}+cdots+c_{n}>0. Then c_{t}, c_{t}+c_{t+1}, cdots, c_{t}+c_{t+1}+cdots+c_{n-1} are all positive. Hence, c_{t}, c_{t+1}, cdots, c_{n} is an (n-t+1)-element good permutation. Therefore, c_{t}, c_{t+1}, cdots, c_{n}, c_{1}, c_{2}, cdots, c_{l} is a good permutation longer than l, which is a contradiction (if c_{t}, c_{t+1}, cdots, c_{n} overlaps with c_{1}, c_{2}, cdots, c_{l}, then removing the overlapping items from c_{1}, c_{2}, cdots, c_{l} still results in a good permutation longer than l). Therefore, l=n.In summary, a circular permutation corresponds to at least one good permutation, and different circular permutations correspond to different good permutations.

I will conclude by giving my favorite example of the use of complex numbers: the prime number theorem. The most natural proofs of this difficult theorem all involve complex numbers:Theorem 8. The proportion of prime numbers less than n is equivalent to frac{log n}{n}.## - Proof of the D'Alembert-Gauss Theorem -We have seen how useful it can be to take the roots of a polynomial, so useful that we will use this technique to give a sketch of the proof of the D'Alembert-Gauss theorem itself. Without going into details, the construction made in the first part, consisting of adding to a set mathbb{R} the root of an algebraic equation, is in fact perfectly general. Starting from a polynomial P with real coefficients, this construction allows us to construct a set K containing mathbb{C} (which also has an addition and a multiplication compatible with that of mathbb{C}) on which the polynomial P is split. This set is called the splitting field of the polynomial P. We now need a tool to relate these roots, which belong to a set K that we control very poorly, to the coefficients of the polynomial, which are real. This link is provided by the theory of symmetric polynomials.Definition 9. A polynomial in the variables left(X_{1}, ldots, X_{n}right) is symmetric if it is invariant under permutation of its variables.Definition 10. Let 1 leq k leq n. We define the k-th elementary symmetric polynomial sigma_{k} in the variables left(X_{1}, ldots, X_{n}right) bysigma_{k}left(X_{1}, ldots, X_{n}right)=sum_{S in{1, ldots, n},|S|=k} prod_{i in S} X_{i}## Proposition 11.prod_{i=1}^{n}left(X-lambda_{i}right)=X^{n}+sum_{k=1}^{n}(-1)^{n} sigma_{k}left(lambda_{1}, ldots, lambda_{n}right) X^{n-k}This proposition is almost obvious: it suffices to expand. We can therefore express the coefficients (real) of our polynomial P in terms of its roots (belonging to its splitting field). We even have more:Theorem 12. Let Q be a symmetric polynomial with real coefficients in n variables left(X_{1}, ldots, X_{n}right). Then there exists a polynomial P with real coefficients and n variables such that:left.Qleft(X_{1}, ldots, X_{n}right)=Pleft(sigma_{1}left(X_{1}, ldots, X_{n}right)right), ldots, sigma_{n}left(X_{1}, ldots, X_{n}right)right)Proof. This theorem has a simple algorithmic proof: we order the monomials of Q lexicographically (i.e., we associate with each monomial the sequence of exponents of the variables left(X_{1}, ldots, X_{n}right), and we classify this with the dictionary order). We then subtract from Q a term in the symmetric polynomials chosen to kill the largest monomial, and we iterate.Thus, any symmetric polynomial in the roots of P (in the splitting field) can be expressed in terms of the coefficients of P (the reals), and is therefore real. We are now able to prove the D'Alembert-Gauss theorem.We reason by induction on the 2-adic valuation of the degree of p. The base case is that every polynomial of odd degree has a root: we look at its values at pm infty (which is an analytic result, it is indeed impossible to give a purely algebraic proof of the D'Alembert-Gauss theorem).Let us show the result at rank k. We write the degree n of P in the form 2^{k} m, with m odd, and we denote its roots left(r_{1}, ldots, r_{n}right), in K. Let t be a real number, we define:q_{t}(z)=prod_{1 leq i, j leq n}left(z-r_{i}-r_{j}-t r_{i} r_{j}right)The coefficients of this polynomial are symmetric in the r_{i}, and are therefore real according to the previous discussion. Since it is of degree 2^{k-1} m(n-1), we can apply the induction hypothesis: one of its roots r_{i}+r_{j}+t r_{i} r_{j} is in fact complex. Since this result is true for all t, and there are infinitely many real numbers, we can even find a pair (i, j) and two real numbers t and s such that r_{i}+r_{j}+s r_{i} r_{j} and r_{i}+r_{j}+t r_{i} r_{j} are both complex. Thus, r_{i} r_{j} and r_{i}+r_{j} are complex, and r_{i} and r_{j} are therefore the roots of the polynomial with complex coefficients X^{2}-left(r_{i}+r_{j}right) x+r_{i} r_{j}. By the usual formulas, these roots are complex, which closes the induction.## - Applications to Plane Geometry -The idea of using complex numbers in geometry is to associate each point in the plane with its complex coordinate (which we call its affix), and to do the calculations on these coordinates. We will denote the point in uppercase, and its affix in lowercase. This very powerful method has many advantages over classical Cartesian geometry. Essentially:- we work with one coordinate instead of two,- trigonometric calculations are violently simplified by the exponential notation,- we have a new operation, multiplication, which has very strong geometric properties.The following few examples of results are thus immediate consequences of the geometric interpretation of complex multiplication.Proposition 13. quad-A B perp C D Leftrightarrow frac{d-c}{b-a} is purely imaginary- A B | C D or A B C D are collinear Leftrightarrow frac{d-c}{b-a} is realMore generally, the oriented angle between the lines A B and C D (in this order) is the argument of frac{d-c}{b-a}. The interpretation of multiplication in terms of similarities shows, for example:Proposition 14. The triangles A B C and D E F are similar (with the same orientation) if and only iffrac{a-c}{b-c}=frac{d-f}{e-f}Finally, the inscribed angle theorem is rewritten as:Proposition 15. The points A B C D are concyclic or collinear if and only iffrac{a-c}{b-c}: frac{a-d}{b-d} in mathbb{R}The symbol : here corresponds to a division. The quantity used in this proposition is called the complex cross-ratio, and is also a key element of complex projective geometry."},{"problem":"9.

Substituting this into the second equation gives -m + 4(2m - 11) = 5, which simplifies to 7m = 49, leading to m = 7.We substitute m back into n = 2m - 11 to find n = 2(7) - 11 = 3.Finally, substituting m = 7 and n = 3 into the third equation m - 2n = lambda, we find lambda = 7 - 2(3) = 1.Therefore, the value of lambda is boxed{1} for the vectors to be coplanar."},{"problem":"6.

How many integers between 1 and 2005 (inclusive) have an odd number of even digits?","solution":"11. The answer is 1002. If the unit digit of an integer n is even, then the unit digit of n+1 is odd, while all other digits of n and n+1 are the same. Therefore, if n has an even number of even digits, then n+1 has an odd number; and if n has an odd number of even digits, then n+1 has an even number. Thus, exactly one of n and n+1 has an odd number of even digits. By dividing the integers from 2 to 2005 into the 1002 pairs (2,3),(4,5),(6,7), ldots,(2004,2005), it follows that exactly 1002 of them have an odd number of even digits.

For two A-type buses and one B-type bus, the total cost is 280 million yuan, leading to the equation:[2x + y = 280]From these equations, we aim to derive the equation x - y = 20 and interpret its meaning.First, let's solve the system of equations step by step:Given:[left{begin{array}{l}x + 2y = 260 2x + y = 280end{array}right.]To eliminate one of the variables, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1, and then subtract the second from the first, which gives us:[2(x + 2y) - (2x + y) = 2(260) - 280]Expanding and simplifying:[2x + 4y - 2x - y = 520 - 280][3y = 240]However, to derive x - y = 20, we approach it differently by directly subtracting the second equation from twice the first equation:[2(x + 2y) - (2x + y) = 2(260) - 280][2x + 4y - 2x - y = 520 - 280][3y = 240]This step was incorrect for our goal.

Let's directly address the correct manipulation to derive x - y = 20:To find x - y, we directly subtract the second equation from twice the first equation:[2(x + 2y) - (2x + y) = 2(260) - 280][2x + 4y - 2x - y = 520 - 280][3y = 240]This approach was mistakenly repeated and did not lead to the correct manipulation. The correct step to derive x - y = 20 is as follows:Subtract the second equation from the first equation multiplied by 2, or directly manipulate them correctly to isolate x - y without unnecessary steps. The correct manipulation is to subtract the second equation from the first, or find another method to directly derive x - y = 20. Let's correct the approach:Given:[left{begin{array}{l}x + 2y = 260 2x + y = 280end{array}right.]Subtract the second equation from twice the first to eliminate y:[2(x + 2y) - (2x + y) = 520 - 280][2x + 4y - 2x - y = 520 - 280][3y = 240]This repeated mistake does not lead to the correct derivation of x - y = 20. The correct step to derive x - y = 20 without introducing errors is as follows:To correctly derive x - y = 20, we look at the system of equations and aim to subtract one from the other in a way that isolates x - y. The correct manipulation involves subtracting the first equation from the second, or finding a direct method to isolate x - y:Given the system:[left{begin{array}{l}x + 2y = 260 2x + y = 280end{array}right.]We aim to directly derive x - y = 20 by correctly manipulating these equations. The correct step involves subtracting the equations in a manner that directly leads to x - y = 20 without the incorrect steps previously shown. Let's directly solve for x - y correctly:Subtract the first equation from the second:[(2x + y) - (x + 2y) = 280 - 260][2x + y - x - 2y = 20][x - y = 20]This equation, x - y = 20, means that the price of each A-type bus is 20 million yuan more expensive than each B-type bus, not 20,000 yuan as stated in the solution.

The only way to use just 6 to cover the perimeter is to put all their centers on the circle radius √3/2, in which case they do not cover the center of the disk. So we need at least 7 disks. We show that 7 suffice. Take 6 equally spaced disks with centers √3/2 from O. Take two adjacent disks, centers X and Y, with perimeters meeting at D inside the large disk.

Consider the polynomial ( x^7 - k^7 ):   Since ( k cdot cosleft(frac{4pi}{7}right) ) is a root, the polynomial ( P(x) ) must divide ( x^7 - k^7 ). We can factor ( x^7 - k^7 ) as:   [   x^7 - k^7 = (x - k)(x^6 + kx^5 + k^2x^4 + k^3x^3 + k^4x^2 + k^5x + k^6)   ]3. Choose ( k = 1 ) to minimize ( |P(1)| ):   For ( k = 1 ), the polynomial simplifies to:   [   x^7 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)   ]   The polynomial ( P(x) ) is then:   [   P(x) = x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1   ]4. Evaluate ( P(1) ):   [   P(1) = 1^6 + 1^5 + 1^4 + 1^3 + 1^2 + 1 + 1 = 7   ]   This confirms that ( |P(1)| = 7 ), which is minimized for ( k = 1 ).5. Find the remainder when ( P(2017) ) is divided by 1000:   [   P(2017) = 2017^6 + 2017^5 + 2017^4 + 2017^3 + 2017^2 + 2017 + 1   ]   We need to compute this modulo 1000. First, reduce 2017 modulo 1000:   [   2017 equiv 17 pmod{1000}   ]   Therefore:   [   P(2017) equiv 17^6 + 17^5 + 17^4 + 17^3 + 17^2 + 17 + 1 pmod{1000}   ]6. Compute powers of 17 modulo 1000:   [   17^2 = 289   ]   [   17^3 = 17 cdot 289 = 4913 equiv 913 pmod{1000}   ]   [   17^4 = 17 cdot 913 = 15521 equiv 521 pmod{1000}   ]   [   17^5 = 17 cdot 521 = 8857 equiv 857 pmod{1000}   ]   [   17^6 = 17 cdot 857 = 14569 equiv 569 pmod{1000}   ]7. Sum the results modulo 1000:   [   P(2017) equiv 569 + 857 + 521 + 913 + 289 + 17 + 1 pmod{1000}   ]   [   P(2017) equiv 3167 pmod{1000}   ]   [   P(2017) equiv 167 pmod{1000}   ]The final answer is ( boxed{167} )."},{"problem":"4. Misha, over the course of a week, picked an apple each day and weighed it. Each apple weighed a different amount, but the weight of each apple was a whole number of grams and ranged from 221 grams to 230 grams (inclusive). Misha also calculated the average weight of all the apples he picked, and it was always a whole number. The apple picked on the seventh day weighed 225 grams. How much did the apple picked on the sixth day weigh?","solution":"Answer: 230 grams.Solution: Each apple weighed 220 grams plus an integer from 1 to 10. From the numbers 1 to 10, we need to choose 7 numbers such that their sum is divisible by 7. One of these numbers is 5, so we need to choose 6 from the numbers 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10. The smallest sum of six of these numbers is 23, and the largest is 44. Adding 5, we get numbers from 28 to 49. In this range, there are 4 numbers divisible by 7: 28, 35, 42, 49. Meanwhile, the sum of the weights for the first 6 days must be divisible by 6. From the numbers 23, 30, 37, 44, only the number 30 satisfies this condition. Thus, the total weight for the first 6 days was 220 cdot 6 + 30 (we will simply write 30, and add the multiple of 220 at the end). The sum of the weights for the first 5 days must be divisible by 5. The possible range for 5 days is from 16 to 40, and the numbers that fit are 20, 25, 30, 40. However, the total weight for 5 days is less than that for 6 days, so it must be less than 30, i.e., 20 or 25. However, the difference between 30 and 25 is 5, and the number 5 is already used. Therefore, the weight of the apples for 5 days is 220 cdot 5 + 20, meaning the apple picked on the 6th day weighed 220 cdot 6 + 30 - (220 cdot 5 + 20) = 230 grams. This value is valid, as the apples picked over the week could have weighed 221, 223, 222, 226, 228, 210, 205 grams."},{"problem":"Find all polynomials P such thatPleft(x^{2}-2 xright)=(P(x-2))^{2}","solution":"A Q(x)=P(x-1) polynomial (1) implies the condition Qleft(x^{2}-2 x+1right)=(Q(x-1))^{2}, which is equivalent toQleft(x^{2}right)=(Q(x))^{2}condition.

Therefore, the last digits of the decimal representation of the numbers x, 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, and 6x are all different, and thus also form a complete set of digits participating in the decimal representation of the number x.

Therefore, x ends in the digit 7, 2x in the digit 4, 3x in the digit 1, 4x in the digit 8, 5x in the digit 5, and 6x in the digit 2.

Understanding the Josephus Problem:   The Josephus problem for step size 2 can be described as follows: Given ( n ) people standing in a circle, every second person is eliminated until only one person remains. The position of the last remaining person can be found using the formula:   [   J(n) = 2 left( n - 2^L right) + 1   ]   where ( L ) is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to ( n ).2.

This can be done by converting ( n ) to its binary representation and identifying the highest bit set to 1.3. Applying the Formula:   Once we have ( L ), we can substitute it into the formula to find the position of the last remaining card.Let's apply this to ( n = 52 ):1.

Initial Consideration:   - We need to find the smallest number of multiplication signs (denoted as \\"•\\") to make the equation (1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * ldots * 60 * 61 * 62 = 2023) true.   - If we use only addition and subtraction, the maximum sum is (1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + 62), which is less than 2023.2. Sum Calculation:   - Calculate the sum (S) of the first 62 natural numbers:     [     S = frac{62 cdot (62 + 1)}{2} = frac{62 cdot 63}{2} = 1953     ]   - Since (1953 < 2023), we need at least one multiplication to increase the total.3. Parity Consideration:   - The sum (S = 1953) is odd.   - If we place one multiplication sign between (a) and (a+1), the result will be:     [     S - a - (a+1) + a(a+1) = 1953 - a - (a+1) + a(a+1)     ]   - This expression simplifies to:     [     1953 - a - a - 1 + a^2 + a = 1953 - 1 + a^2 - a = 1952 + a^2 - a     ]   - Since (a^2 - a) is always even, the result (1952 + a^2 - a) is even. Therefore, it cannot be 2023, which is odd.4.

However, the slope given is negative, which means we are looking for an angle in a different quadrant where the tangent has the same absolute value but is negative. Since tan theta is positive in the first and third quadrants and negative in the second and fourth quadrants, and given that the range of the slope of a line is between 0^{circ} and 180^{circ} (which excludes the third and fourth quadrants for the purpose of this problem), we find the equivalent positive slope in the second quadrant. The equivalent angle in the second quadrant that gives the same tangent value (but positive) is found by subtracting the angle from 180^{circ}.

Case 1: ( n ) is odd:   - Counterexample for ( k = 2n - 1 ):     Consider a set ( A ) of ( 2n - 1 ) elements, all congruent to ( 1 mod n ). Any subset of ( A ) will have a sum congruent to the number of elements in the subset modulo ( n ). Since ( n ) is odd, any subset with an even number of elements will have a sum congruent to an even number modulo ( n ), which cannot be zero modulo ( n ). Hence, ( k = 2n - 1 ) is not sufficient.   - Proof for ( k = 2n ):     Consider any set ( A ) of ( 2n ) elements. We can partition ( A ) into two disjoint subsets ( A_1 ) and ( A_2 ) each containing ( n ) elements. By the Pigeonhole Principle, there exists a subset of ( A_1 ) whose sum is divisible by ( n ). If this subset has an even number of elements, we are done. If it has an odd number of elements, consider the subset of ( A_2 ) whose sum is divisible by ( n ). If this subset has an even number of elements, we are done. If both subsets have an odd number of elements, their union will have an even number of elements, and the sum of their elements will be divisible by ( n ). Thus, ( k = 2n ) is sufficient.4. Case 2: ( n ) is even:   - Counterexample for ( k = n ):     Consider a set ( A ) of ( n ) elements, where ( n - 1 ) elements are congruent to ( 1 mod n ) and one element is congruent to ( 0 mod n ). Any subset of ( A ) with an even number of elements will have a sum congruent to an even number modulo ( n ), which cannot be zero modulo ( n ). Hence, ( k = n ) is not sufficient.   - Proof for ( k = n + 1 ):     Consider any set ( A ) of ( n + 1 ) elements.

Comparing the variances step by step:- s_{A}^{2}=0.5 is less than s_{B}^{2}=0.6, indicating A is more stable than B.- s_{B}^{2}=0.6 is less than s_{C}^{2}=0.9, indicating B is more stable than C.- s_{C}^{2}=0.9 is less than s_{D}^{2}=1.0, indicating C is more stable than D.Since s_{A}^{2} is the smallest among the given variances, we conclude that person A has the most stable shooting performance.

Thus, its nth term a_n is given by a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term and d is the common difference.To find a_1, we plug n=1 into the given expression for a_n:a_1 = 43 - 3 cdot 1 = 40.The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence, S_n, can be computed by the formula:S_n = frac{n}{2}left(2a_1 + (n-1)dright).By substituting the values of a_1 and d into the formula above, we get:S_n = frac{n}{2}left(2 cdot 40 + (n-1)(-3)right),which simplifies to:S_n = frac{n}{2}(80 - 3n + 3).Further simplifying and reordering terms, we obtain:S_n = frac{n}{2}(83 - 3n).Recognizing this as a quadratic function in n with a negative leading coefficient, we know that its graph is a downward-opening parabola, which has a maximum value at the vertex. The vertex of the parabola given by the function f(n) = -an^2 + bn + c is at n = -frac{b}{2a}.In our function S_n = -frac{3}{2}n^2 + frac{83}{2}n, the vertex occurs at:n = -frac{frac{83}{2}}{2 cdot -frac{3}{2}} = frac{83}{6}.Since n must be a positive integer, the integer value of n that is closest to frac{83}{6} and does not exceed it is n=13.

If we now look at how the squares can lie over four adjacent columns, we see that there are 7 possibilities. One way to see this is by looking at the leftmost column of such a set of four adjacent columns. The possibilities for the leftmost column are 1 through 7 (if you start from column 8, you end up outside the figure).

The rules for team challenge finals are as follows: based on the class as a unit, each class must have at least 20 participants, and the number of participants must be even.

A answers one of the first three questions incorrectly and both of the last two questions correctly.Given that the probability of answering the first three questions correctly is frac{1}{2} each, and the probability of answering the last two questions correctly is frac{1}{3} each, we calculate as follows:- For the first scenario, the probability is simply the product of the probabilities of answering the first three questions correctly: {(frac{1}{2})}^{3} = frac{1}{8}.- For the second scenario, we calculate the probability of answering at least one of the last two questions correctly after answering the first three questions correctly. This is the complement of answering both incorrectly, so we use the combination formula to account for the different ways to choose which questions are answered correctly:{C}_{3}^{2}×{(frac{1}{2})}^{3}×[1-{(frac{2}{3})}^{2}] = 3×frac{1}{8}×left(1-frac{4}{9}right) = frac{3}{8}×frac{5}{9} = frac{15}{72}.- For the third scenario, we calculate the probability of answering one of the first three questions incorrectly and both of the last two questions correctly:{C}_{3}^{1}×{(frac{1}{2})}^{3}×{(frac{1}{3})}^{2} = 3×frac{1}{8}×frac{1}{9} = frac{3}{72}.Adding these probabilities together gives us the total probability of A advancing to the next round:P(A) = frac{1}{8} + frac{15}{72} + frac{3}{72} = frac{9+15+3}{72} = frac{27}{72} = frac{3}{8}.Therefore, the probability of A advancing to the next round is boxed{frac{3}{8}}.Part 2:To determine which way of participation increases the chances of the class team succeeding, we calculate the probabilities P_{1} and P_{2} for Way 1 and Way 2, respectively.- For Way 1, the probability of at least one of the two students answering correctly in a group is 1-left(1-pright)^{2}.

AF = 3, BD = CE = 12. Let the incenter be I. The triangle AFI has ∠AFI = 90 o , ∠FAI = A/2, and FI = r. So r/AF = tan A/2. Similarly, r/BD = tan B/2, r/CE = tan C/2. So the given relation is 2 tan A/2 + 5 tan B/2 + 5 tan C/2 = 6. We have A/2 = 90 o - (B/2 + C/2), so we can eliminate A/2, using tan A/2 = cot(B/2 + C/2) = (1 - tan B/2 tan C/2)/(tan B/2 + tan C/2). Hence 5 tan 2 B/2 + 5 tan 2 C/2 + 8 tan B/2 tan C/2 - 6 tan B/2 - 6 tan C/2 + 2 = 0 (*). It is not immediately clear where we go from here. But we are asked to prove that ABC is isosceles. Since the given relation is symmetrical in B and C, presumably AB = AC and angle B = angle C, in which case (*) reduces to (3 tan B/2 - 1) 2 = 0. So our goal must be to show that 3 tan B/2 - 1 = 3 tan C/2 - 1 = 0. If we use 3 tan B/2 - 1 and 3 tan C/2 - 1 as variables, we have (3 tan B/2 - 1) 2 = 9 tan 2 B/2 - 6 tan B/2 + 1, (3 tan C/2 - 1) 2 = 9 tan 2 C/2 - 6 tan C/2 + 1, (3 tan B/2 - 1)(3 tan C/2 - 1) = 9 tan B/2 tan C/2 - 3 tan B/2 - 3 tan C/2 + 1. Comparing to (*), we see that it can be written as 5 (3 tan B/2 - 1) 2 + 5 (3 tan C/2 - 1) 2 + 8(3 tan B/2 - 1)(3 tan C/2 - 1) = 0. But 8 2 < 4·5·5, so this implies 3 tan B/2 - 1 = 3 tan C/2 - 1 = 0. So tan A/2 = 4/3 and we have found all the angles in the triangle. We have AF = r cot A/2 = 3, BD = CE = r cot B/2 = 12.

Therefore, ( a = BC = DB + CD = 10 + 8 = 18 ).2. The distances from the touchpoints to the vertices are related to the semi-perimeter ( s ) as follows:   [   s - b = 10 quad text{and} quad s - c = 8   ]   Adding these two equations, we get:   [   (s - b) + (s - c) = 10 + 8 implies 2s - (b + c) = 18   ]   Since ( s = frac{a + b + c}{2} ), we can substitute ( a = 18 ) into the equation:   [   2s - (b + c) = 18 implies 2s - (b + c) = 18   ]   Subtracting the above equation from ( 2s = a + b + c ), we get:   [   a = 18   ]   Therefore, we have:   [   b + c = 2s - 18   ]3. Subtracting the two equations ( s - b = 10 ) and ( s - c = 8 ), we get:   [   (s - b) - (s - c) = 10 - 8 implies c - b = 2   ]4. Now, we use Heron's formula to find the area of the triangle. The area ( Delta ) of the triangle can also be expressed in terms of the inradius ( r ) and the semi-perimeter ( s ):   [   Delta = r cdot s   ]   Given that the radius ( r = 4 ), we have:   [   Delta = 4s   ]5. Using Heron's formula, the area ( Delta ) is also given by:   [   Delta = sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}   ]   Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:   [   4s = sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}   ]   Squaring both sides, we obtain:   [   (4s)^2 = s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) implies 16s^2 = s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)   ]   Dividing both sides by ( s ), we get:   [   16s = (s - a)(s - b)(s - c)   ]6. Substituting ( s - a = s - 18 ), ( s - b = 10 ), and ( s - c = 8 ), we have:   [   16s = (s - 18) cdot 10 cdot 8   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   16s = 80(s - 18)   ]   Solving for ( s ), we get:   [   16s = 80s - 1440 implies 64s = 1440 implies s = frac{1440}{64} = 22.5   ]7. Now, we have ( s = 22.5 ). Using the equations ( s - b = 10 ) and ( s - c = 8 ), we find:   [   b = s - 10 = 22.5 - 10 = 12.5   ]   [   c = s - 8 = 22.5 - 8 = 14.5   ]8. Therefore, the lengths of the sides ( AB ) and ( AC ) are:   [   AB = c = 14.5 quad text{and} quad AC = b = 12.5   ]The final answer is ( AB = boxed{14.5} ) and ( AC = boxed{12.5} )."},{"problem":"A group of three logicians are to distribute 10 gold coins.

The cells of a 2 times 2019 table must be filled with numbers (exactly one number in each cell) according to the following rules. In the top row, there should be 2019 real numbers, none of which are equal, and in the bottom row, there should be the same 2019 numbers, but in a different order. In each of the 2019 columns, there should be two different numbers, and the sum of these two numbers should be a rational number. What is the maximum number of irrational numbers that could be in the first row of the table?(S. Kudrya)","solution":"Answer: 2016.Solution. Estimation. We will prove that in the first row of the table, where numbers are arranged according to the rules, there are no fewer than three rational numbers (and, accordingly, no more than 2016 irrational numbers). Each number appearing in the table is written in exactly two cells, one of which is in the top row, and the other in the bottom row. Consider some column, let the number in its top cell be (a_1), and in the bottom cell (a_2) (we will briefly denote such a column as ((a_1, a_2))). We will color the column ((a_1, a_2)). We will find the column where the number (a_2) is in the top cell and color it. If this column is ((a_2, a_1)), we will end the process. Otherwise, if this column is ((a_2, a_3)), where (a_3 neq a_1), we will continue: we will color the column where the number (a_3) is in the top cell, and so on - until we reach the column where (a_1) is in the bottom cell (this will definitely happen, since the numbers equal to (a_2, a_3, ldots) are colored in pairs). At the end of the process, we will get a set of colored columns ((a_1, a_2), (a_2, a_3), ldots, (a_k, a_1)), which we will call a cycle of length (k). If there are still uncolored columns, we will highlight another cycle, and so on. In the end, the set of all columns of the table will be divided into non-intersecting cycles. Since the sum of the lengths of all cycles is 2019, there will be a cycle of odd length.Consider this cycle: ((a_1, a_2), (a_2, a_3), ldots, (a_{2t+1}, a_1)), where (t geq 1). By the condition, (a_1 + a_2 = b_1, a_2 + a_3 = b_2, ldots, a_{2t+1} + a_1 = b_{2t+1}), where all (b_i) are rational numbers. Then (2a_1 = (a_1 + a_2) - (a_2 + a_3) + (a_3 + a_4) - ldots - (a_{2t} + a_{2t+1}) + (a_{2t+1} + a_1) = b_1 - b_2 + b_3 - ldots - b_{2t} + b_{2t+1}) is a rational number, so (a_1) is rational. Similarly, all numbers (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2t+1}) are rational, and there are no fewer than (2t+1 geq 3).Example. We will provide an example of a table filled according to the rules, in the top row of which there are 2016 irrational numbers:[begin{array}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}hline 1 & 2 & 3 & 1+sqrt{2} & 1-sqrt{2} & 2+sqrt{2} & 2-sqrt{2} & ldots & 1008+sqrt{2} & 1008-sqrt{2} hline 2 & 3 & 1 & 1-sqrt{2} & 1+sqrt{2} & 2-sqrt{2} & 2+sqrt{2} & ldots & 1008-sqrt{2} & 1008+sqrt{2} hlineend{array}]Remark. Note that the condition of the odd length of the row of the table is significant. For an even length of the row, it is not difficult to construct examples of tables in which all numbers are irrational.The condition that a number does not stand under itself is also important, otherwise a cycle of length 1 could appear, and the answer to the problem would be 2018.Comment. The correct estimation (no more than 2016 irrational or, equivalently, no fewer than 3 rational numbers) is proven - 5 points.The statement about the partition of the permutation into independent cycles is accepted without proof.If the estimation is not proven, it is proven that in the columns forming a cycle of odd length, all numbers are rational - 2 points (out of 5 possible points for the estimation).A correct example with 2016 irrational numbers is provided - 2 points.Proof of the irrationality of square roots of natural numbers that are not perfect squares, cube roots of natural numbers that are not perfect cubes, etc., is not required."},{"problem":"[ Two pairs of similar triangles ] [Properties and characteristics of a parallelogram ]Points M and N are located on sides A B and A D of parallelogram A B C D, such that A M: M B=1: 2, A N: N D=3: 2.

We start with the given condition that ( 8^n + n ) is divisible by ( 2^n + n ).

Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:   [   8^n + n = (2^n)^3 + n   ]3.

Question: For what value of a is l(a) maximized? Find this maximum l(a).---The function f(x) = ax^2 + 8x + 3 is a quadratic function with a negative leading coefficient a, meaning it opens downwards. We need to find the maximum positive number l(a) such that |f(x)| leq 5 for all x in the interval [0, l(a)].First, we need to determine the points where f(x) = 5 and f(x) = -5. These points will help us find the interval where |f(x)| leq 5.1.

This means all the ladybugs are liars. But in this case, the first ladybug actually told the truth, which cannot be. Therefore, the first three ladybugs cannot lie simultaneously, so either the second or the third told the truth, and the other two are liars. Thus, each of the other ladybugs told the truth.Therefore, there are two ladybugs with four spots on their backs, and several ladybugs with six spots on their backs, and in total, the spots on the backs of all the ladybugs are either 30 or 26.

Since each carriage is shared by three people, the number of carriages used is frac{x}{3}. Therefore, the total number of carriages is frac{x}{3} + 2.2. When two people share a carriage, nine people have to walk. This means that not all people can be accommodated in the carriages when each carriage is shared by two people. The number of carriages used in this scenario is frac{x-9}{2}, because nine people are walking and not using the carriages, and the remaining people are sharing the carriages, two per carriage.3.

Laplace-Beltrami Operator on the Sphere:   The Laplace-Beltrami operator Delta on the sphere S^{n-1} is a generalization of the Laplace operator to curved surfaces. For a function f on S^{n-1}, the Laplace-Beltrami operator is given by:   [   Delta f = frac{1}{sqrt{g}} frac{partial}{partial x^i} left( sqrt{g} g^{ij} frac{partial f}{partial x^j} right)   ]   where g is the determinant of the metric tensor g_{ij} of the sphere.2.

Eigenfunctions:   The eigenfunctions corresponding to these eigenvalues are the spherical harmonics Y_{k,m}, where m is a multi-index that labels the different spherical harmonics of degree k.4. Multiplicity of Eigenvalues:   The multiplicity of the eigenvalue lambda_k = -k(k+n-2) is given by the dimension of the space of spherical harmonics of degree k on S^{n-1}.

Radius of the Sphere:   Since the sphere has radius R, the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the sphere of radius R is related to the operator on the unit sphere by a scaling factor. Specifically, the eigenvalues on the sphere of radius R are scaled by a factor of 1/R^2. Therefore, the eigenvalues on the sphere of radius R are:   [   lambda_k = -frac{k(k+n-2)}{R^2}   ]Conclusion:The eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a sphere of radius R in Euclidean space of dimension n are:[lambda_k = -frac{k(k+n-2)}{R^2}]with multiplicities:[text{dim}(mathcal{H}_k) = binom{n+k-1}{k} - binom{n+k-3}{k-2}]The final answer is ( boxed{ lambda_k = -frac{k(k+n-2)}{R^2} } ) with multiplicities (text{dim}(mathcal{H}_k) = binom{n+k-1}{k} - binom{n+k-3}{k-2})."},{"problem":"[ Area and orthogonal projection ]Find the area of the section of a regular triangular prism ABCA1B1C1 by a plane passing through vertex C and the midpoint of side B1C1 of the base A1B1C1, and parallel to the diagonal AC1 of the lateral face AA1C1C, if the distance between the line AC1 and the cutting plane is 1, and the side of the base of the prism is sqrt{14}.","solution":"Let's denote the side of the base of the prism by ( a ) ( ( a = sqrt{14} ) ).

To determine the range of values for a, we proceed as follows:1. Understand the Behavior of f(x):   - The function f(x) increases based on the value of |x-a|.    - Since e^x is always increasing for any x, |x-a| must also be increasing in the given interval for f(x) to be increasing.2. Analyze the Monotonicity of |x-a|:   - For f(x) to be increasing on [1, +infty), the expression inside the exponential function, |x-a|, must be increasing in this interval.   - The absolute value function |x-a| increases when x geq a. This is because, to the right of a, moving further away from a increases the difference |x-a|, which in turn increases f(x).3. Conclude the Range for a Based on Monotonicity:   - Since |x-a| must be increasing on [1, +infty) for f(x) to be increasing, it implies that the interval [1, +infty) must be part of the interval where |x-a| is increasing.   - Therefore, we have that [1, +infty) subseteq [a, +infty). This relationship implies that a leqslant 1 because for [1, +infty) to be fully contained within [a, +infty), the starting point of [a, +infty) (which is a) must be less than or equal to the starting point of [1, +infty) (which is 1).4. State the Final Answer:   - Given the above analysis, the range of values for a that ensures f(x) is increasing on the interval [1, +infty) is a leqslant 1. Therefore, the final answer for the range of a is (-infty, 1].So, the range of values for a is boxed{(-infty, 1]}."},{"problem":"Problem 4. Let n in mathbb{N}^{*}, n geq 2.

What is the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of the block?","solution":"I. solution: In the conventional numbering of houses on a street, house numbers always increase by 2, so the house numbers on a continuous segment form an arithmetic sequence. On one side, all house numbers are either odd or even. Let the number of the first house on the segment be a_{1}, and the number of houses be n, then the number of the last house is a_{n}=a_{1}+2(n-1), and thus their sum is:S_{n}=frac{left(a_{1}+a_{n}right) n}{2}=frac{left[2 a_{1}+2(n-1)right] n}{2}=left(a_{1}+n-1right) n=117and from thisa_{1}=frac{117}{n}-n+1Accordingly, n can only be one of the divisors of 117, and specifically 5 or a larger number, since there are at least 5 houses on the street segment, and also such that a_{1} is positive. Already at this point, writing 117 as a product of prime powers 117=3^{2} cdot 13, the divisors are: 1,3,9,13,39,117, among which only n=9 meets the requirements, and with this a_{1}=5. Thus, the fifth house bears the number 5+4 cdot 2=13. (This house is also the fifth from the end of the segment.)László Magdolna (Budapest, Martos Flóra Secondary School, 3rd year)II. solution: The sum is odd, so it can only be about the odd side of the street segment. And the number of houses on the segment is also odd, because the sum of an even number of odd addends is even. The sum of an odd number of consecutive terms of an arithmetic sequence is equal to the product of the middle term (denoted by m) and the number of terms n=2 k-1. Thus, on the one handm n=117on the other hand, the middle (k-th) term of a 2 k-1=2(k-1)+1 term sequence in our case is at least 1+2(k-1)=2 k-1, i.e., m geq 2 k-1=n. According to this, 117=m n geq n^{2}, and thus n leq 10. However, n geq 5, so only 9 is the appropriate size among the divisors of 117 for n. From this, the sought house number is again 13.Gergely Márton (Pannonhalma, Bencés Secondary School, 3rd year)III. solution: Our row of houses is on the odd side. If we add up n odd numbers starting from 1, the sum is n^{2}. Since 117 is not a perfect square, the first house in our row cannot be 1. Thus, 117 must be writable as the difference of two square numbers: 117=b^{2}-c^{2}, where b is the number of houses from the beginning of the street to the end of our row, and c is the number of houses preceding our row. Nowb^{2}-c^{2}=(b-c)(b+c)=117=1 cdot 117=3 cdot 39=9 cdot 13based on the above, we select the solution similarly.Gergely Márton (Pannonhalma, Bencés Secondary School, 3rd year)Remarks. 1. Here, to speak simply, we assumed that there is a house on every plot. Of course, we always assumed that there are no merged or divided plots on the street segment (e.g., 11-13, or 7 / a).2.

Using the Pigeonhole Principle: Consider all sums of the form ( sum_{i=1}^n b_i x_i ) where ( b_i in {0, 1} ). There are ( 2^n ) such sums. If ( 2^n > n^3 ), then by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least two distinct sums that have the same remainder when divided by ( n^3 ).3.
