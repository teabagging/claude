Let p(n) be the probability that his final score is n. Find lim p(n). Solution","solution":": 2/7. For i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, let p i (n) = prob that the final score is n+i if the player stops when his total score is at least n. We note that p(n) is also the probability that the player's total equals n on some throw if he throws repeatedly. Now we can see that p 5 (n) = 1/6 p(n-1), because the only way to achieve a final score of n+5 without passing through n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4 is to reach n-1 and then throw a 6. Similarly, p 4 (n) = 1/6 p(n-1) + 1/6 p(n-2), because to reach n+4 without passing through n, n+1, n+2, n+3 you must either to through n-1, which requires reaching n-1 and then throwing a 5, or not, in which case you must reach n-2 and then throw a 6. Similarly, p 3 (n) = 1/6 p(n-1) + 1/6 p(n-2) + 1/6 p(n-3), p 2 = 1/6 p(n-1) + 1/6 p(n-2) + 1/6 p(n-3) + 1/6 p(n-4), and p 1 (n) = 1/6 p(n-1) + 1/6 p(n-2) + 1/6 p(n-3) + 1/6 p(n-4) + 1/6 p(n-5). Adding, we get: 1 = p(n) + p 1 (n) + p 2 (n) + p 3 (n) + p 4 (n) + p 5 (n) = p(n) + 5/6 p(n-1) + 4/6 p(n-2) + 3/6 p(n-3) + 2/6 p(n-4) + 1/6 p(n-5). In the limit, p(n-5) = p(n-4) = ... = p(n). Hence we get: p 1 (n) = 5/6 p(n), p 2 (n) = 4/6 p(n), p 3 (n) = 3/6 p(n), p 4 (n) = 2/6 p(n), p 5 (n) = 1/6 p(n). But they sum to 1, so p(n) = 2/7. The objection to the above is that it fails to establish that lim p(n) exists. So one should arguably add the following. We have (as above) p(n) = 1/6 p(n-1) + 1/6 p(n-2) + 1/6 p(n-3) + 1/6 p(n-4) + 1/6 p(n-5) + 1/6 p(n-6) (*). Let m(n) = min{ p(n-1), p(n-2), p(n-3), p(n-4), p(n-5), p(n-6) }. Then (*) establishes that p(n) ≥ m(n), and so m(n+1) ≥ m(n). Similarly, let M(n) = max{ p(n-1), p(n-2), p(n-3), p(n-4), p(n-5), p(n-6) }. Then (*) shows that p(n) ≤ M(n), so M(n+1) ≤ M(n). Thus m(n) is a monotonic increasing sequence and M(n) is a monotonic decreasing sequence. But m(n) is obviously bounded above by any M(m), and M(n) is bounded below by any m(m). So both sequences converge. Suppose they converged to different limits. So m(n) converges to m and M(n) converges to M with M - m > 36k > 0. Take n sufficiently large that m(n) > m - 6k. At least one of the terms on the rhs of (*) must equal M(n) and the others are at least m(n), so p(n) ≥ 5/6 m(n) + 1/6 M(n) > 5/6 (m - 6k) + 1/6 M > 5/6 m - 5k + 1/6 (m + 36k) = m+ k. But that means that m(n) > m+k for all sufficiently large n. Contradiction. Hence M and m are the same and p(n) must have the same limit. 21st Putnam 1960 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 15 Feb 2002"},{"problem":"12.

(1) Find the functional relationship between y and x, and directly state the range of values for the independent variable x; (2) At what price should each product be sold to maximize the monthly profit? What is the maximum monthly profit?","solution":"Step-by-Step Solution:(1) To find the functional relationship between y and x, we start with the given conditions. The cost price is 40 yuan, and the initial selling price is 50 yuan. The initial sales volume is 210 units per month. With each 1 yuan increase in the selling price, the sales volume decreases by 10 units. Therefore, if the selling price increases by x yuan, the new selling price becomes (50 + x) yuan, and the sales volume becomes (210 - 10x) units. The profit, y, is the product of the sales volume and the profit per unit, which is the selling price minus the cost price. Thus, we have:[y = (210 - 10x)(50 + x - 40) = (210 - 10x)(10 + x)]Expanding this, we get:[y = 210(10 + x) - 10x(10 + x) = 2100 + 210x - 100x - 10x^2 = -10x^2 + 110x + 2100]Given that the selling price cannot exceed 65 yuan, and the initial selling price is 50 yuan, the maximum increase, x, can be 65 - 50 = 15 yuan. Therefore, the range of x is 0 < x leqslant 15, and x must be an integer.So, the functional relationship between y and x is:[y = -10x^2 + 110x + 2100]with the range of x being 0 < x leqslant 15 and x is an integer.(2) To maximize the monthly profit, we analyze the quadratic function y = -10x^2 + 110x + 2100. Completing the square, we get:[y = -10(x^2 - 11x) + 2100 = -10left(x^2 - 11x + frac{11^2}{4}right) + 2100 + 10 cdot frac{11^2}{4}][y = -10left(x - frac{11}{2}right)^2 + 2402.5]Since the coefficient of x^2 is negative (-10), the parabola opens downwards, indicating a maximum value at the vertex. The vertex occurs at x = 5.5, giving a maximum y value of 2402.5. However, since x must be an integer, we consider the closest integers to 5.5, which are 5 and 6.For x = 5, the selling price is 50 + 5 = 55 yuan, and the profit y is:[y = -10(5)^2 + 110(5) + 2100 = 2400 text{ yuan}]For x = 6, the selling price is 50 + 6 = 56 yuan, and the profit y is:[y = -10(6)^2 + 110(6) + 2100 = 2400 text{ yuan}]Therefore, the profit is maximized when the selling price is set at either 55 yuan or 56 yuan per unit, and the maximum monthly profit is:[boxed{2400 text{ yuan}}]"},{"problem":"Find the P G C D of all numbers of the form n^{13}-n.Translate the above text into English, please keep the original text's line breaks and format, and output the translation result directly.","solution":"We will find all primes that divide n^{13}-n for all n, i.e., p mid (n^{12}-1) for all n coprime with p.

The segments L_{1} B and A N are projections of the parallel segments L_{1} N_{1} and N O onto the line L_{1} N, and L_{1} N_{1}=2 N O.

Since L_{1} N perp alpha, this distance is the segment A B, so A B=1.Let L_{1} N=d. Since N_{1} B is the height of the right triangle L_{1} N_{1} N, then L_{1} B cdot L_{1} N=L_{1} N_{1}^{2}=2 and, therefore, L_{1} B=frac{2}{d}.

However, for l to be perpendicular to the plane alpha, it is necessary but not sufficient that l is perpendicular to two lines m and n within alpha. A crucial condition that is missing here is that m and n must intersect, i.e., mcap nneq varnothing. Without this condition, we cannot guarantee that l is perpendicular to every line in alpha, hence making option A incorrect.Option B: It suggests that if mbot alpha and lbot m, then lparallel alpha. This statement is flawed because l being perpendicular to m does not imply l is parallel to alpha. In fact, l could very well lie within the plane alpha if it intersects m at the right angle within alpha. Thus, option B is incorrect.Option C: This option claims that if mbot alpha and alpha bot beta, then mparallel beta. This reasoning is incorrect because m being perpendicular to alpha and alpha being perpendicular to beta does not necessarily mean m is parallel to beta. It's possible for m to lie within beta if beta is oriented such that m intersects it perpendicularly. Therefore, option C is incorrect.Option D: Here, it is stated that if mbot alpha, nbot beta, and mparallel n, then alpha parallel beta. Given the conditions, if two lines m and n are parallel and each is perpendicular to a different plane (alpha and beta respectively), it logically follows that the planes alpha and beta must be parallel to each other. This is because the direction perpendicular to both planes is uniquely defined by the direction of m and n, and since m and n are parallel, the planes must also be parallel to maintain the perpendicularity condition.Therefore, after analyzing each option based on the given conditions and geometric principles, the correct answer is:boxed{D}"},{"problem":"Using the completing the square method to transform 2x^{2}-4x-3=0, the result is ( ).A: 2left(x-1right)^{2}-4=0B: 2{(x-1)}^{2}-frac{5}{2}=0C: {(x-1)}^{2}-frac{5}{2}=0D: (x-1)^{2}-5=0","solution":"To solve the given quadratic equation 2x^{2}-4x-3=0 using the completing the square method, we follow these steps:1.

When the slope of the required line does not exist, the line is x=-3, which satisfies the condition.   When the slope of the required line exists, we assume the equation of the line is y=k(x+3), which can be rewritten as kx-y+3k=0. According to the problem, we have frac{|2+3k|}{ sqrt{{k}^{2}+1}}=3.

Since the center of the circle is on the line x-y-2=0, the coordinates of the center of the circle are (-1,-3).   The radius of the circle is sqrt{(-1-0)^{2}+(-3-2)^{2}}= sqrt{26}.   Therefore, the equation of the circle is (x+1)^{2}+(y+3)^{2}=26.   Hence, the answer is boxed{(x+1)^{2}+(y+3)^{2}=26}.4. Analysis: This problem tests the application of plane vectors in a circle and the theorem of intersecting chords, which is a medium-level problem.   Solution: According to the problem, the center of the circle is (2,0) with a radius of 1. The circle intersects the x-axis at points (1,0) and C(3,0).   A line passing through the external point P(3,4) intersects the circle at points A and B. Then, PC is tangent to the circle, and | overset{→}{PC}|=4.   By the theorem of intersecting chords, overrightarrow{PA}cdot overrightarrow{PB}={ overset{→}{PC}}^{2}={4}^{2}=16.   Hence, the answer is boxed{16}."},{"problem":"15th Irish 2002 Problem A3 Find all positive integer solutions to p(p+3) + q(q+3) = n(n+3), where p and q are primes.","solution":"(p,q,n) = (2,3,4), (3,2,4), (3,7,8), (7,3,8).

The prism has a regular octagonal base, and all edges are of length 1.

Intersection Points:   For a point ( P ) inside the prism, let ( P_i ) be the intersection point (not equal to ( M_i )) of the line ( M_iP ) with the surface of the prism. The problem states that each ( P_i ) lies on a different face of the prism and does not belong to any edge.3. Volume Constraints:   Assume ( M_9P ) intersects a face, say ( B_1B_2T_1T_2 ). Then ( M_{10}P ) can intersect either the same face or the bottom base. By the problem conditions, ( P ) must be in the volume ( B_1B_2T_2T_1M_9 ) and also in the volume ( B_1B_2ldots B_8M_{10} ). These two volumes intersect in the bottom half of the prism, implying ( P ) is located in the bottom half.

Assume the ray ( N_1Q ) intersects the segment ( B_2B_3 ). Then ( Q ) is in the triangle ( triangle B_2B_3N_1 ), and only one of the six rays ( N_3Q, N_4Q, ldots, N_8Q ) can intersect this triangle. Hence, ( N_1Q ) cannot intersect ( B_2B_3 ).5. Intersection Analysis:   Similarly, if ( N_1Q ) intersects ( B_3B_4 ), then ( Q ) is in ( triangle B_3B_4N_1 ), and only two of the five rays ( N_4Q, N_5Q, ldots, N_8Q ) can intersect this triangle. Hence, ( N_1Q ) cannot intersect ( B_3B_4 ). Continuing this analysis, ( N_1Q ) cannot intersect ( B_4B_5, B_8B_1, B_7B_8, B_6B_7 ), so it must intersect ( B_5B_6 parallel B_1B_2 ).6. Opposite Parallel Faces:   Likewise, ( N_2Q ) intersects the opposite parallel segment ( B_6B_7 ), ( N_3Q ) intersects ( B_7B_8 ), and so on. Thus, all the rays ( M_iP ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, 10 ) intersect the opposite parallel faces or bases of the prism.7.

To achieve this distribution, we must:- Choose 3 balls to go into the first box,- then choose 2 of the remaining 3 balls to go into the second box,- by default, 1 of the remaining ball goes into the third box,- and the last box remains empty.Also, there are A_4^3 ways to assign these quantities to the boxes since we could have any of the 4 boxes be the one with 0 balls, and the remaining 3 quantities can be distributed in 3! = 6 ways among the other 3 boxes.We calculate the number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 6, 2 balls out of the remaining 3, and finally the 3 out of 4 boxes for the 3, 2, and 1 using the combinations and arrangements:m = C_6^3 cdot C_3^2 cdot C_1^1 cdot A_4^3= 20 cdot 3 cdot 1 cdot 24= 1440Therefore, the probability p that the balls are distributed in the configuration of 3, 2, 1, and 0 in the boxes is given by the ratio of m to n:p = frac{m}{n} = frac{1440}{4096} = frac{45}{128}Therefore, the probability that the 4 boxes contain exactly 3, 2, 1, and 0 balls is boxed{frac{45}{128}}."},{"problem":"In any finite grid of squares, some shaded and some not, for each unshaded square, record the number of shaded squares horizontally or vertically adjacent to it; this grid's [i]score[/i] is the sum of all numbers recorded this way. Deyuan shades each square in a blank  ntimes n grid with probability k; he notices that the expected value of the score of the resulting grid is equal to k, too! Given that k > 0.9999, find the minimum possible value of n.[i]Proposed by Andrew Wu[/i]","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the minimum value of ( n ) such that the expected score of an ( n times n ) grid, where each square is shaded with probability ( k ) and ( k > 0.9999 ), is equal to ( k ).2. Score Calculation:   The score of the grid is defined as the sum of the number of shaded squares horizontally or vertically adjacent to each unshaded square. This can be interpreted as the number of pairs of adjacent squares with opposite colors.3. Expected Score Calculation:   The expected score of the grid is the expected number of pairs of adjacent squares with opposite colors. By the Linearity of Expectation, we can calculate this as follows:   - There are ( 2n(n-1) ) pairs of adjacent squares in an ( n times n ) grid (considering both horizontal and vertical pairs).   - Each pair can be either (shaded, unshaded) or (unshaded, shaded), giving us 2 ways.   - The probability of a pair being (shaded, unshaded) is ( k(1-k) ).   Therefore, the expected score ( E ) is:   [   E = 2n(n-1) cdot 2 cdot k(1-k)   ]4. Setting Up the Equation:   Given that the expected score is equal to ( k ), we have:   [   4n(n-1)k(1-k) = k   ]5. Simplifying the Equation:   Dividing both sides by ( k ) (since ( k > 0 )):   [   4n(n-1)(1-k) = 1   ]6. Substituting ( k ):   Given ( k > 0.9999 ), we substitute ( k = frac{9999}{10000} ):   [   4n(n-1)left(1 - frac{9999}{10000}right) = 1   ]   Simplifying inside the parentheses:   [   4n(n-1) cdot frac{1}{10000} = 1   ]7. Solving for ( n ):   [   4n(n-1) = 10000   ]   Solving this quadratic equation:   [   n(n-1) = 2500   ]   [   n^2 - n - 2500 = 0   ]8.

Solution: From the given information, we have frac{c}{a} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} (equation 1).Since the ellipse passes through point P(frac{sqrt{6}}{2}, frac{1}{2}), we have frac{(frac{sqrt{6}}{2})^{2}}{a^{2}} + frac{(frac{1}{2})^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1 (equation 2).Also, a^{2} = b^{2} + c^{2} (equation 3).Solving equations 1, 2, and 3, we get a^{2} = 2, b^{2} = c^{2} = 1.Thus, the equation of the ellipse is frac{x^{2}}{2} + y^{2} = 1.2.

Proof: Method 1: Let K be the foot of the perpendicular from point F to line OM.The equation of line OM is y = frac{t}{2}x, and the equation of line FN is y = -frac{2}{t}(x - 1).Solving the system of equations, we get x = frac{4}{t^{2} + 4}, so K(frac{4}{t^{2} + 4}, frac{2t}{t^{2} + 4}).Thus, |OK| = sqrt{frac{16}{(t^{2} + 4)^{2}} + frac{4t^{2}}{(t^{2} + 4)^{2}}} = sqrt{frac{4}{t^{2} + 4}} and |OM| = sqrt{4 + t^{2}}.Since |ON|^{2} = |OK| cdot |OM| = sqrt{frac{4}{4 + t^{2}}} cdot sqrt{4 + t^{2}} = 2, we have |ON| = sqrt{2}.Thus, the length of line segment ON is a constant value, boxed{sqrt{2}}.Method 2: Let N(x_{0}, y_{0}).

Since two different lines can have at most one point in common, this is the maximum number of distinct intersection points.b) We have just seen that exactly 6 intersection points can be generated if no two lines are parallel and no three intersect at the same point.If (a) and (b) are parallel, but (c) and (d) are neither parallel to each other nor to (a) (and (b)), then (c) and (d) each have two intersection points with (a) and (b). If the intersection point of (c) and (d) is not one of these four, there are a total of 5.

There cannot be any more, as two different lines can intersect at most at one point.It remains to show that exactly two intersection points are not possible:Assume there were such a configuration. Then the three lines (a, b), and (c) cannot be pairwise parallel, as this would (as shown above) result in exactly 0 or exactly 3 intersection points with (d).They also cannot intersect at a common point (P), as this would (if (d) passes through (P)) result in exactly 1 or (if (d) does not pass through (P)) exactly (1+3=4) intersection points. They also cannot be pairwise non-parallel, as the coincidence of two of their three intersection points would immediately imply that the third is also identical, placing us in the previous case.Thus, of the three lines (a, b), and (c), exactly two must be parallel and the third not parallel to them. Without loss of generality, let (a | b) and (b nVdash c). Similarly, we can consider the three lines (b, c), and (d), of which again two must be parallel and the third not parallel to them. In the case (b | d), we get the contradiction (a|b| d) analogously to above, resulting in exactly 3 intersection points, and in the remaining case (c | d), we get exactly 4 intersection points (as shown above), so not exactly 2.Therefore, every number of intersection points from 0 to 6, except for 2, can be realized."},{"problem":"460° is ( )A: An angle in the first quadrantB: An angle in the second quadrantC: An angle in the third quadrantD: An angle in the fourth quadrant","solution":"Answer: Based on the periodicity of angles, which is 2kpi, we solve as follows:  460° = 360° + 100°  On the coordinate system, it is located in the second quadrant.

By looking modulo 3, we have 5^{m} + 1 equiv 2^{m} + 1 equiv a^{2} pmod{3}. The powers of 2 modulo 3 alternate between 2 if m is odd and 1 if m is even, so 2^{m} + 1 is either 2 or 0 modulo 3. Since the squares modulo 3 are 0 and 1, we deduce that 2^{m} + 1 must be 0 modulo 3, hence m is odd. By looking modulo 7, we get 5^{m} equiv a^{2} pmod{7}. The squares modulo 7 are 0, 1, 2, 4, and the powers of 5 modulo 7 alternate between 1, 5, 4, 6, 2, 3. Thus, 5^{m} is 0, 1, 2, or 4 if and only if m is 0, 2, or 4 modulo 6, which is impossible since m is odd.

The cubes modulo 7 are 0, 1, 6. The powers of 5 modulo 7 alternate between 1, 5, 4, 6, 2, 3. Thus, we get that m equiv 0 pmod{6} or m equiv 3 pmod{6}; in all cases, 3 divides m. We then look modulo 9: we have 5^{m} + 4 equiv a^{3} pmod{9}. Since m is divisible by 3, 5^{m} and a^{3} are cubes. The cubes modulo 9 are 0, 1, 8. Thus, 5^{m} - a^{3} can be 0, 1, 2, 7, 8 modulo 9, but not 4, which is contradictory. Therefore, k neq 3.Suppose k=3 is superb: there exist three strictly positive integers m, n, and a such that 5^{m} + 63n + 49 = a^{4} = (a^{2})^{2}. In particular, 2 is superb, which is contradictory.Note that 5 is superb: by taking a=3, we have a^{k} = 3^{5} = 243 = 5^{1} + 63 times 3 + 49, so 5 is superb.

Identify the Original Function: The original function given is y = -3x + 2.2. Apply the Shift: To shift the graph down by 3 units, we subtract 3 from the original function. This is based on the rule that to shift a graph vertically, we add (to shift up) or subtract (to shift down) a constant from the function's output. Therefore, we perform the operation:   [   y = (-3x + 2) - 3   ]3. Simplify the New Function Expression: Simplifying the expression obtained in step 2, we combine like terms:   [   y = -3x + 2 - 3 = -3x - 1   ]4. Conclusion: The new function expression, after shifting the original graph down by 3 units, is y = -3x - 1.Therefore, the corresponding function expression of the resulting graph, after the shift, is boxed{y = -3x - 1}.[Analysis]  This solution directly applies the rule of shifting linear functions vertically. By subtracting 3 from the original function, we achieve the desired downward shift. This approach is straightforward and relies on understanding how vertical shifts affect the function's equation.[Comments]  This problem tests the understanding of how geometric transformations, specifically vertical shifts, affect the equation of a linear function.

Using this property and reduction formulas, we can find equivalent angles for the given expressions:- For cos(-585^circ): since cosine has a period of 360^circ, we have cos(-585^circ) = cos(-585^circ + 360^circ) = cos(-225^circ). And again, cos(-225^circ) = cos(135^circ). Finally, we can find that cos(135^circ) = -cos(45^circ) because cosine is negative in the second quadrant and 135^circ is directly across the unit circle from 45^circ.- For tan 495^circ: using the periodicity of 180^circ for tangent, we have tan 495^circ = tan(495^circ - 2 cdot 180^circ) = tan(135^circ). Tangent of an angle in the second quadrant (tan 135^circ) will be negative because tan(theta) = frac{sin(theta)}{cos(theta)} and sine is positive while cosine is negative in the second quadrant.- For sin(-690^circ): with a period of 360^circ for sine, we get sin(-690^circ) = sin(-690^circ + 2 cdot 360^circ) = sin(30^circ).Now, substituting the simplified forms of these trigonometric functions back into the original expression, we have:frac {cos(-585^circ)}{tan 495^circ +sin(-690^circ)} = frac {-cos 45^circ}{-tan 45^circ + sin 30^circ} = frac {-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}}{-1 + frac{1}{2}}Solving further, we get:frac {-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}}{-1 + frac{1}{2}} = frac {-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}}{-frac{1}{2}} = frac {sqrt{2}}{2} cdot frac{2}{1} = boxed{sqrt{2}}"},{"problem":"A function f(x) defined on mathbb{R} satisfies: f(x+2)= frac{1-f(x)}{1+f(x)}.

The midpoints of the legs A D and B C are E and F, respectively. The points Q and S lie on the midline E F, because by the property of the angle bisectors, for example, Q is equidistant from A B and C D, and thus half the distance of the trapezoid's height m. Furthermore, angle P Q R and angle P S R are right angles, because, for example, the angle bisector of angle A D C is parallel to the external angle bisector at A, and thus perpendicular to A Q. Therefore, the quadrilateral N is a cyclic quadrilateral. - Moreover, Q lies on the Thales circle above the diameter A D, Q E = A D / 2, and similarly S F = B C / 2. Based on this, Q S can be calculated, equal to the absolute value of the difference between (A D + B C) / 2 and E F = (A B + C D) / 2.If Q and S do not coincide, P and R lie on different sides of the line Q S, which is the midline E F. Therefore, Q S divides N into triangles Q S P and Q S R, whose heights m_{P} and m_{R} perpendicular to Q S can be expressed based on the fact that, for example, triangles A B P and Q S P are similar:m_{P} = frac{m}{2} cdot frac{Q S}{A B pm Q S}, text{ similarly } m_{R} = frac{m}{2} cdot frac{Q S}{Q S pm C D}(the lower signs in the double signs are valid if the points appear in the order E, Q, S, F on the midline).

Through the center of a sphere with radius sqrt{2}, 6 lines parallel to the edges of a certain regular tetrahedron are drawn. The points of intersection of these lines with the sphere are the vertices of a convex polyhedron. Calculate the volume and surface area of this polyhedron.","solution":"Solution. Let the initial tetrahedron be denoted by T. The tetrahedron T has 6 edges, so 6 lines intersect the sphere at 12 points. Therefore, the polyhedron, which we will denote by M, has 12 vertices. Since all lines pass through the center of the sphere, the polyhedron M is centrally symmetric with respect to the center of the sphere O.Consider three lines parallel to the three edges of the tetrahedron T passing through a fixed vertex A of the tetrahedron T. Choose a direction on each of them corresponding to the extension of the corresponding edge of the tetrahedron beyond the vertex A and consider the three rays emanating from the center of the sphere in the specified directions. These rays form angles of 60^{circ} with each other, so the three points of their intersection with the sphere, together with the center of the sphere, form the vertices of a regular tetrahedron, the side of which is equal to the radius of the sphere. The face of this tetrahedron, formed by the three vertices lying on the sphere, is, obviously, a face of our polyhedron.When considering the three additional rays to those described above, we obtain another tetrahedron, centrally symmetric to the one just described, and, accordingly, another triangular face of our polyhedron.By performing the same procedure for each vertex of the tetrahedron T, we obtain 8 regular tetrahedra contained in our polyhedron, and, accordingly, 8 of its faces, which are regular triangles. The volume of each such tetrahedron is, as is easy to calculate, 1 / 3, and the area of one face, respectively, sqrt{3} / 2. Therefore, the contribution of the found tetrahedra to the volume of the polyhedron is 8 / 3, and to the surface area, respectively, 4 sqrt{3}.Now fix any edge a of the tetrahedron T. Consider now the four rays passing through the center of the sphere, parallel to the four edges of the tetrahedron adjacent to the edge a. (As in the first consideration, choose a direction on each of them corresponding to the extension of the corresponding edge of the tetrahedron beyond the vertex belonging to the edge a.) Obviously, these four rays intersect the sphere at four points, forming, together with the center of the sphere, a regular quadrilateral pyramid, the base of which is a face of our polyhedron. As is easy to calculate, the area of the base is 2, and the volume of the pyramid, respectively, 2 / 3.The number of such quadrilateral pyramids is equal to the number of edges, i.e., 6, so their contribution to the volume is 4, and to the surface area, respectively, 12.It remains to be convinced that these 8 tetrahedra and 6 quadrilateral pyramids exhaust our polyhedron. (It is obvious that all these 14 pyramids intersect each other only along the boundary.) This is easiest to do by drawing a sketch. First, note that the three lines parallel to the three edges of the base of the initial tetrahedron lie inthe same plane alpha, which cuts our polyhedron along a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle of a great circle, along which the plane alpha cuts the sphere. This hexagon divides our polyhedron into two centrally symmetric parts, so it is enough to draw a sketch of one of the two halves. On the upper hemisphere, there are only three more vertices of the polyhedron, forming a triangular face b, obtained by the construction described above. It is easy to see that the face b is parallel to the cutting plane alpha, and above the plane alpha there are exactly three more such faces, each of which is formed by one vertex of the face b and two nearest adjacent vertices of the hexagon. The other three faces, formed by one side of the triangular face b and one parallel side of the hexagon - squares, which are the bases of the described quadrilateral pyramids.Therefore, we have exhausted the entire polyhedron M, so its volume is 12 + 4 sqrt{3}, and the surface area is 4 + 8 / 3 = 12 / 3.Answer: The volume is 12 + 4 sqrt{3}, the surface area is 4 + 8 / 3 = 12 / 3."},{"problem":"[quad Area of a TrapezoidZad [Isosceles, Inscribed, and Circumscribed Trapezoids]The diagonal of an isosceles trapezoid bisects its obtuse angle.

Homogenization: Since the inequality is homogeneous, we can assume without loss of generality that ( sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 1 ).3. Simplification: We start by simplifying the left-hand side of the inequality:   [   sum_{i<j} x_{i}x_{j} left(x^{2}_{i}+x^{2}_{j} right) = sum_{i<j} left(x_i^3 x_j + x_j^3 x_i right).   ]   This can be rewritten as:   [   sum_{i<j} x_i^3 x_j + sum_{i<j} x_j^3 x_i = sum_{i=1}^n x_i^3 sum_{substack{j=1  j neq i}}^n x_j = sum_{i=1}^n x_i^3 (1 - x_i).   ]4. Objective: We need to show that:   [   sum_{i=1}^n x_i^3 (1 - x_i) leq frac{1}{8}.   ]5. Convexity Argument: Consider the function ( f(x) = x^3 (1 - x) ). The second derivative of ( f ) is:   [   f''(x) = 6x(1 - 2x).   ]   This shows that ( f(x) ) is convex on ( (0, 0.5) ).6. Optimal Construction: We claim that any optimal construction can have at most one ( x_i ) in the range ( (0, 0.5) ). If there are two such ( x_i ) and ( x_j ), we can perform an operation to decrease ( x_i ) by a small amount ( epsilon ) and increase ( x_j ) by the same amount, which increases the sum due to the convexity of ( f ) on ( (0, 0.5) ).7. Reduction to Two Nonzero Elements: The optimal configuration contains at most two nonzero elements. If there are more than two nonzero elements, we can reduce the problem to two elements by similar convexity arguments.8. Final Step: We need to prove:   [   x_i x_j (x_i^2 + x_j^2) leq frac{1}{8} quad text{given} quad x_i + x_j = 1.   ]   Let ( a = x_i x_j ). Then:   [   x_i^2 + x_j^2 = (x_i + x_j)^2 - 2x_i x_j = 1 - 2a.   ]   Thus, we need to show:   [   a(1 - 2a) leq frac{1}{8}.   ]   This simplifies to:   [   -2 left(a - frac{1}{4}right)^2 leq 0,   ]   which is clearly true with equality when ( a = frac{1}{4} ). This implies ( x_i = x_j = frac{1}{2} ).9.

How many ways is this possible? How many of these ways involve the rook reaching the goal in 5 moves?","solution":"I. Solution. a) It is enough to determine the number of different paths leading from the starting point to the goal, which constantly approach each other, since on each path the rook can move in exactly one way: completing each step before changing direction. For example, on both paths in Figure 1, the rook reaches the goal in 5 steps, with step lengths of 2,1,2,6,3 and 5,3,1,4,1 squares, respectively.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_8043402a13f37c257e57g-1.jpg?height=637&width=550&top_left_y=337&top_left_x=755)Due to the rules, we can only arrive at the squares in the leftmost column and the bottom row of the board from their lower or left neighbors, respectively, and this is expressed by the 1s written on the corresponding squares of the chessboard in Figure 2. For the other squares, we can arrive from both the lower and left neighbors, and the number of paths leading to each square from the starting point is the sum of the number of paths leading to the two neighbors (which must be crossed first). These sums were written on the squares, row by row, moving upwards and from left to right. According to the final entry in the goal square, the number of paths - and the number of ways the rook can move - is 3432.| 1 | 8 | 36 | 120 | 330 | 792 | 1716 | 3432 || :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || 1 | 7 | 28 | 84 | 210 | 462 | 924 | 1716 || 1 | 6 | 21 | 56 | 126 | 252 | 462 | 792 || 1 | 5 | 15 | 35 | 70 | 126 | 210 | 330 || 1 | 4 | 10 | 20 | 35 | 56 | 84 | 120 || 1 | 3 | 6 | 10 | 5 | 21 | 28 | 36 || 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 || * | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |Figure 2b) According to the two 5-step examples in Figure 1, the rook covers the 7-square width and height between the 1st and 8th rows and columns of the chessboard in 3 and 2, or 2 and 3 steps, respectively: 2+2+3=1+6=7, and 5+1+1=3+4=7. (The bold digits represent the horizontal steps.) Indeed, since the required 5-step number is odd, the number of steps in the two directions must be different, and due to the alternating direction of the steps, the difference can be at most 1.First, we determine how many ways the rook can cover 7 squares in 2 or 3 steps. It is easy to see that in 2 steps, there are 6 ways, because the rook must stop in exactly one of the 2nd, 3rd, ..., 7th rows (or columns), and this row can be chosen in 6 ways. (In the examples, the 2nd row and the 4th column.)In 3 steps, 2 different stopping points must be chosen from the 6. If we first stop in thetext { 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, } 6 text{th. }column, the second stopping point can be chosen in5,4,3,2,1ways, because this is the number of remaining columns between the 8th column and the first chosen stopping column. (The first stopping point cannot be chosen in the 7th column.) The sum of the found numbers is 15.Based on this, the number of 5-step movement modes is 15 cdot 6 cdot 2=180. Indeed, each such mode can be obtained by inserting the 2-step coverage of the height into each of the 15 possibilities of covering the width in 3 steps, at the stopping points, and finally multiplying by 2 because in each movement mode, the width and height can be swapped.

This is only possible in a specific position of the rings, as is the opening of the lock.On the rings, six letters are engraved; four of them (one per ring) form the known key word when in the open position.a) How many different key words are possible with this construction at each lock? A \\"key word\\" is any (even nonsensical) combination of four letters.b) Compare the security of this lock with that of a similar lock that has six rings with four letters each.c) How many different rings with six different letters from the 26 letters of the alphabet can the manufacturing company produce?Rings are considered the same if they have the same letters (regardless of order) and the notch is under the same letter.d) How many locks with different key words can be made from these rings?","solution":"a) First, one can set the first ring in six different positions. Then, for each of these positions, six positions of the second ring are possible. Thus, there are already 36 different possibilities for the first two rings.For each of these, the third ring can again be set in six different ways, resulting in 216 settings.Finally, this number is multiplied by six again when the last ring is set, so that a total of 1296 different settings result.In general, it can be shown that with n rings each with m numbers, m^{n} different keywords can be formed.b) From the solution of a) it follows immediately:1. A lock with four rings, each with six letters, contains 1296 keywords,2. A lock with six rings, each with four letters, contains 4096 keywords.The security of the second lock is therefore in the ratio of 4096: 1296 approx 3: 1 to that of the first, i.e., the second lock is about three times as secure as the first.c) It is necessary to determine how many possibilities there are to select k (in our case k=6) different elements from n (in our case n=26) different elements.First, one can select a letter from the 26 letters in 26 different ways.For each of these 26 possibilities, there are now 25 possibilities for selecting a second letter, making a total of 26 cdot 25.However, it is easy to see that each combination of letters appears twice: for example, to c the letter d is chosen once and to d the letter c is chosen once. Therefore, the product 26 cdot 25 must still be divided by two to obtain the number of different possibilities. For each of these possibilities, there are again 24 new selection possibilities for the third letter, but each combination of letters appears multiple times: for example, to (a b) the letter c is added once, to (b c) the letter a is added once, and to (a c) the letter b is added once. There are no other combinations of the three elements a, b, and c. Thus, the number of 26 cdot 25 cdot 24 combinations is now reduced to frac{26 cdot 25 cdot 24}{1 cdot 2 cdot 3}=2600.One can see how the development continues:In general, the number of combinations of k elements from n elements is given byx=frac{n cdot(n-1) cdot(n-2) cdot ldots cdot(n-k+1)}{1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdot ldots cdot k}in our case, therefore, x=230230.Since each of the rings can have the notch under any letter, this number must still be multiplied by six: 230230 cdot 6=1381380. Thus, there are 1381380 different rings.d) Since each of the 26 letters can appear on each of the four rings of a lock, the task is to determine how many different combinations of 4 out of 26 letters there are, where the order matters but each letter can repeat up to four times.First, one can select 26 letters; for each of these 26 possibilities, one can again choose a second letter in 26 different ways, so that one already has 26 cdot 26=26^{2} possibilities.One then considers further that the number is again multiplied by 26 when selecting the third letter: 26^{3}. When selecting the fourth, there are then 26^{4}=456976 different possibilities. Clearly, the same formula as in a) applies generally."},{"problem":"10.221.

Calculate the perimeter of the shape formed by the green squares.

The top right corner of the first drawn square will be marked as A_{1}, the top right corner of the second drawn square as A_{2}, and so on.From the vertex A_{0} to the vertex A_{1}, one can move 4 mathrm{~cm} to the right and 4 mathrm{~cm} up. To reach the vertex A_{2}, one needs to move another 3 mathrm{~cm} to the right and another 3 mathrm{~cm} up, and to reach the vertex A_{3}, another 3 mathrm{~cm} to the right and another 3 mathrm{~cm} up.

From the starting point, the sum of all movements must equal the length of the side of the large square, which is 2020 mathrm{~cm}. For the first square, the movement is 4 mathrm{~cm}, and for each subsequent square, it is 3 mathrm{~cm}.Let n be the total number of squares of side length 4 mathrm{~cm} in this sequence.Then we have 4 mathrm{~cm} + (n-1) cdot 3 mathrm{~cm} = 2020 mathrm{~cm}.This simplifies to 3n + 1 = 2020, from which we get n = 673.The perimeter of the resulting shape can be obtained by subtracting the sum of the perimeters of the small squares of side length 1 mathrm{~cm} that overlap from the sum of the perimeters of all squares of side length 4 mathrm{~cm}.The desired perimeter is 673 cdot 16 mathrm{~cm} - 672 cdot 4 mathrm{~cm} = 8080 mathrm{~cm} = 808 mathrm{dm}.## Solution, second methodAs in the first method, determine that the total number of squares is 673.The first and last squares in the sequence contribute to the perimeter of the shape with 4+4+3+3=14 mathrm{~cm}, while all others contribute with 3+3+3+3=12 mathrm{~cm}.

The function f(p)=frac{p}{2}+frac{2}{p} is strictly increasing both to the left (smaller p values) and to the right (larger p values) of the previously found minimum point.

Each even-indexed difference is smaller than the term preceding it, and (excluding d_{1}) each odd-indexed one is larger than the term preceding it, because in the so-called second difference sequence left(e_{k}=d_{k+1}-d_{k}right), the terms -2,10,-6,14,-10,18,-14,22 are of alternating signs.Relying on this, let's try the odd and even indexed terms of the original sequence separately.

According to the problem, we need to find the smallest natural number n such thatfrac{n(n+1)}{2}=k cdot 10^{4}and rearranged:n(n+1)=k cdot 2 cdot 2^{4} cdot 5^{4}=k cdot 2^{5} cdot 5^{4}=k cdot 32 cdot 625with an appropriate natural number k.n and n+1 are two consecutive integers, so they cannot have a common divisor greater than 1. Therefore, only one of them can be even; and that one must be divisible by 32. Similarly, only one of them can be divisible by 5; which means it must also be divisible by 625.It is possible that the same number is divisible by both 32 and 625, which gives n=32 cdot 625=20000, or n+1=32 cdot 625, so n=19999. However, it is also possible that one of n and n+1 is divisible by 32 and the other by 625. This represents two cases, depending on whether n or n+1 is divisible by 32.Let's first consider n=32 x and n+1=625 y, with suitable integers x and y. Thus, 625 y=32 x+1, or in standard form:625 y-32 x=1This is a so-called two-variable linear Diophantine equation. Its general form is a cdot x+b cdot y=c, where a, b, c are given integers; and the equation is Diophantine because we seek solutions (x, y) in the integers. It is known that such equations have solutions if and only if the greatest common divisor of a and b divides c. In this case, this is clearly satisfied. Now we will solve the equation in this specific case. We consider the smaller of the coefficients of the unknowns, which is 32, and find the number closest to 625 that is divisible by 32, which is 640. Writing the initial equation as 640 y-15 y-32 x=1 and factoring out the 32, we get 32(20 y-x)-15=1, and we introduce the new unknown u=20 y-x, where u is also an integer; thus we have:32 u-15 y=1This is a Diophantine equation for u and y. Using a similar procedure as before, we write this as 15(2 u-y)+2 u=1, which gives:15 v+2 u=1, quad text{where} quad v=2 u-y text{ is an integer.}We need one more step: we write the equation as 2(7 v+u)+v=1, or:2 w+v=1, quad text{where} quad w=7 v+u text{ is an integer.}Now we can express v in terms of w: v=1-2 w. Then, using the relations (3), (2), and (1), we can express u, y, and x in terms of w:u=w-7 v=w-7(1-2 w)=15 w-7, y=2 u-v=2(15 w-7)-(1-2 w)=32 w-15, x=20 y-u=20(32 w-15)-(15 w-7)From the procedure, it follows that x and y can only be of this form, where w is an integer. Conversely, if w is an integer, then substituting the values of x and y into the initial equation, they satisfy it. Since n is positive, x and y must also be positive, which is only possible if w is positive. The smallest n is obtained when x (and y) are minimal. This happens when w=1, so x=332 and y=17. This gives n=332 cdot 32=10624. (Similarly, n+1=17 cdot 625=10625).We must not forget the other case, where n=625 y and n+1=32 x. This leads to the equation 625 y-32 x=-1. Performing the procedure here, we get:y=32 w+15 quad text{and} quad x=625 w+293Now, for n (and thus x and y) to be positive, it is sufficient that w geq 0; and clearly the minimal possibility is when w=0. We get:n=625 cdot y=625 cdot 15=9375which indeed provides the solution, since 9375<10624<19999<20000.Remarks. 1.

Therefore, the possible angles are:   [   10^circ, 20^circ, 40^circ, 50^circ, 70^circ, 80^circ   ]2. Check for acute triangle conditions:   For a triangle to be acute, all its angles must be less than (90^circ). The angles listed above satisfy this condition.3. Sum of angles in a triangle:   The sum of the angles in any triangle must be (180^circ). We need to find combinations of three distinct angles from the set ({10^circ, 20^circ, 40^circ, 50^circ, 70^circ, 80^circ}) that add up to (180^circ).4. Eliminate invalid angles:   - If we include (10^circ) in the triangle, the remaining two angles must sum to (170^circ), which is impossible since the maximum sum of two angles from the set is (80^circ + 70^circ = 150^circ).   - If we include (20^circ) in the triangle, the remaining two angles must sum to (160^circ), which is also impossible for the same reason.5. Check remaining combinations:   - For (40^circ), the remaining two angles must sum to (140^circ). Possible pairs are ((50^circ, 90^circ)), ((70^circ, 70^circ)), and ((80^circ, 60^circ)). None of these pairs are valid since (90^circ) and (60^circ) are not in the set, and (70^circ) cannot be repeated.   - For (50^circ), the remaining two angles must sum to (130^circ). Possible pairs are ((70^circ, 60^circ)) and ((80^circ, 50^circ)). Neither pair is valid since (60^circ) is not in the set, and (50^circ) cannot be repeated.   - For (70^circ), the remaining two angles must sum to (110^circ). Possible pairs are ((40^circ, 70^circ)) and ((50^circ, 60^circ)). Neither pair is valid since (60^circ) is not in the set, and (70^circ) cannot be repeated.   - For (80^circ), the remaining two angles must sum to (100^circ). Possible pairs are ((20^circ, 80^circ)) and ((40^circ, 60^circ)). Neither pair is valid since (60^circ) is not in the set, and (80^circ) cannot be repeated.6. Conclusion:   After testing all possible combinations, we find that no set of three distinct angles from ({10^circ, 20^circ, 40^circ, 50^circ, 70^circ, 80^circ}) sums to (180^circ). Therefore, it is impossible to form such a triangle.(boxed{0})"},{"problem":"Given the function f(x) = 1 + frac{1}{x}, find the average rate of change of f(x) on the interval [1, 2].","solution":"The value of the function at the endpoints of the interval [1, 2] can be calculated by substituting x into the function f(x):For x=1, we have f(1) = 1 + frac{1}{1} = 2.For x=2, we have f(2) = 1 + frac{1}{2} = frac{3}{2}.The average rate of change of a function over an interval [a, b] is given by the formula:text{Average rate of change} = frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}.Applying this formula, the average rate of change of the function f(x) on the interval [1, 2] is:frac{f(2) - f(1)}{2 - 1} = frac{frac{3}{2} - 2}{1} = frac{frac{3}{2} - frac{4}{2}}{1} = frac{-frac{1}{2}}{1} = -frac{1}{2}.Therefore, the average rate of change of f(x) on the interval [1, 2] is boxed{-frac{1}{2}}."},{"problem":"6.

Determine the height h of the prism:   Given that the volume of the prism is 3sqrt{7} and the base triangle ABC has sides AB=2 and AC=3, we can express the volume as S_{triangle ABC}h. The area of triangle ABC is frac{1}{2}times AB times AC times sin theta = frac{1}{2}times 2times 3times sin theta = 3sin theta. Thus, we have:   [3sin theta times h = 3sqrt{7}]   Simplifying, we find:   [hsin theta = sqrt{7} quad Rightarrow quad h = frac{sqrt{7}}{sintheta}]2. Find the radius r of the circumscribed circle of triangle ABC:   The radius r can be calculated using the formula r=frac{BC}{2sintheta}. The length of BC is found using the Pythagorean theorem:   [BC = sqrt{AB^2 + AC^2} = sqrt{4 + 9} = sqrt{13}]   Therefore, the radius r is:   [r = frac{sqrt{13-6costheta}}{2sintheta}]3. Determine the radius R of the circumscribed sphere:   The radius R of the sphere is related to r and h by:   [R^2 = r^2 + left(frac{h}{2}right)^2]   Substituting the expressions for r and h, we get:   [R^2 = frac{13-6costheta}{4sin^2theta} + frac{7}{4sin^2theta} = frac{20-6costheta}{4sin^2theta} = frac{5-3costheta}{sin^2theta}]4. Minimize the function f(theta) = frac{5-3costheta}{sin^2theta}:   We differentiate f(theta) with respect to theta and set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:   [f'(theta) = frac{(3costheta-1)(costheta-3)}{sin^3theta}]   Solving f'(theta) = 0 gives costheta = frac{1}{3}, which corresponds to theta = arccosfrac{1}{3}. Analyzing the sign of f'(theta), we find that f(theta) is decreasing before theta = arccosfrac{1}{3} and increasing afterwards, indicating a minimum at theta = arccosfrac{1}{3}.5. Calculate the minimum value of f(theta):   Substituting costheta = frac{1}{3} into f(theta), we find:   [sintheta = sqrt{1-left(frac{1}{3}right)^2} = frac{2sqrt{2}}{3}]   Thus, the minimum value of f(theta) is:   [frac{5-1}{left(frac{2sqrt{2}}{3}right)^2} = frac{9}{2}]6.

We now present two solution paths.₪ First solution, combinatorial. We construct a simple undirected bipartite graph Gamma as follows:- the vertex set consists of two copies of V(G), say V_{text {out }} and V_{text {in }}; and- for v in V_{text {out }} and w in V_{text {in }} we have an undirected edge v w in E(Gamma) if and only if the directed edge v rightarrow w is in G.Moreover, the desired sub-digraphs of H correspond exactly to perfect matchings of Gamma.However the graph Gamma is 2-regular and hence consists of several disjoint (simple) cycles of even length. If there are n such cycles, the number of perfect matchings is 2^{n}, as desired.Remark. The construction of Gamma is not as magical as it may first seem.Suppose we pick a road v_{1} rightarrow v_{2} to use. Then, the other road v_{3} rightarrow v_{2} is certainly not used; hence some other road v_{3} rightarrow v_{4} must be used, etc. We thus get a cycle of forced decisions until we eventually return to the vertex v_{1}.These cycles in the original graph G (where the arrows alternate directions) correspond to the cycles we found in Gamma. It's merely that phrasing the solution in terms of Gamma makes it cleaner in a linguistic sense, but not really in a mathematical sense.『 Second solution by linear algebra over mathbb{F}_{2} (Brian Lawrence). This is actually not that different from the first solution. For each edge e, we create an indicator variable x_{e}. We then require for each vertex v that:- If e_{1} and e_{2} are the two edges leaving v, then we require x_{e_{1}}+x_{e_{2}} equiv 1(bmod 2).- If e_{3} and e_{4} are the two edges entering v, then we require x_{e_{3}}+x_{e_{4}} equiv 1(bmod 2).We thus get a large system of equations. Moreover, the solutions come in natural pairs vec{x} and vec{x}+overrightarrow{1} and therefore the number of solutions is either zero, or a power of two. So we just have to prove there is at least one solution.For linear algebra reasons, there can only be zero solutions if some nontrivial linear combination of the equations gives the sum 0 equiv 1. So suppose we added up some subset Sof the equations for which every variable appeared on the left-hand side an even number of times. Then every variable that did appear appeared exactly twice; and accordingly we see that the edges corresponding to these variables form one or more even cycles as in the previous solution. Of course, this means |S| is even, so we really have 0 equiv 0(bmod 2) as needed.Remark. The author's original proposal contained a second part asking to show that it was not always possible for the resulting H to be connected, even if G was strongly connected.

Using the fact that the sum of the number of books donated by any 6 classes is no less than 50 %, we can solve for the range of x, and the maximum value of x is the required maximum percentage.【Solution】Solution: According to the analysis, let Class A be the class that donates the most books, x % is the percentage of the number of books it donates out of the total, and the remaining 9 classes can be divided into three groups A, B, and C, with the percentages of the number of books they donate being a %, b %, and c %. Then:2(100-x)=2(a+b+c)=(a+b)+(b+c)+(c+a) geqslant 50+50+50,Solving this, we get: x leqslant 25.therefore The maximum percentage of the number of books donated by the class that donates the most books cannot exceed 25 %.When each of the 9 classes donates a percentage of the total number of books equal to frac{75}{9} %=8 frac{1}{3} %, then the sum of the number of books donated by any 6 of them is exactly 50 % of the total, and Class A's donation is exactly 25 %.Therefore, the answer is: 25 %."},{"problem":"(14) There are 20 cards, each with a number from 1,2,3, cdots, 20, placed in a box.

Find all integers n geqslant 1 such that for every prime p < n, n - leftlfloorfrac{n}{p}rightrfloor p is not divisible by a square different from 1.","solution":"Solution to Exercise 15: Let's analyze the problem: we are looking for integers n that satisfy a certain property. We can start by finding the small values of n that work: by testing integers n between 1 and 20, we find {1,2,3,5,7,13}.One of the first things to do when faced with this problem is to give meaning to n-leftlfloorfrac{n}{p}rightrfloor p. Since frac{n}{p} is the division of n by p, we can try to see if this quantity can be interpreted from the Euclidean division.Note that n-leftlfloorfrac{n}{p}rightrfloor p is the remainder of the Euclidean division of n by p. Indeed, if n = pq + r with q an integer and 0 leq r leq p-1, we have leftlfloorfrac{n}{p}rightrfloor = leftlfloor q + frac{r}{p}rightrfloor = q so n - leftlfloorfrac{n}{p}rightrfloor p = r.Next, we observe that all the solutions found except 1 are prime numbers: we will try to show that an integer n satisfying the property must be prime, for example by taking p as one of its divisors.Let n > 1 be an integer satisfying the property. We deduce from this that if n is not prime, if p is a divisor of n, then n - 4 is not divisible by p if p geq 5.By the same reasoning, n-8 and n-9 are not divisible by p if p geq 10.Now let's analyze the prime factors of n-8 and n-9: they can be divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7. For the factor 3, since 3 divides n-4, n equiv 1 pmod{3}, so n-8 equiv 2 pmod{3} and n-9 equiv 1 pmod{3}, so they are not divisible by 3.Moreover, n-8 is not divisible by 2 because n is not. Since n-8 and n-9 are coprime, three cases arise:- If n-8 = 5^y with y a positive integer, we have n-4 = 5^y + 4 = 3^x.  Here, since 4 is a square, we would like to show that 3^x is a square to factorize the equation. For this, we look modulo 4 because we have squares and 5 equiv 1 pmod{4}.  Looking modulo 4, we have 3^x equiv 1^y equiv 1 pmod{4}. Otherwise, since the order of 3 modulo 4 is 2, 2 divides x so x is even. Let x = 2k, we have (3^k - 2)(3^k + 2) = 5^y so 3^k - 2 is positive and 3^k - 2 and 3^k + 2 are powers of 5. Here we have a product of terms equal to a power of 2, so we try to compute their gcd to hope to bound one of the terms. In particular, the gcd of 3^k + 2 and 3^k - 2 divides (3^k + 2) - (3^k - 2) = 4 which is not divisible by 5, and it divides their product, i.e., 5^y, so it is 1. Since 3^k - 2 and 3^k + 2 are powers of 2 with gcd 1, the smallest one is 1, so we have 3^k - 2 = 1 which gives k = 1 so x = 2. We get n = 3^x + 4 = 9 + 4 = 13.- If n-8 = 7^y with y a positive integer, we have n-4 = 7^y + 4 = 3^x.  Since 4 is a square, we would like to show that x is even to factorize, for this we look modulo 7. Note that if y = 0, there is no solution to this equation. Otherwise, we have 3^x equiv 4 pmod{7}, and the powers of 3 modulo 7 are 1, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, so the order of 3 is 6 and we must have x equiv 4 pmod{6} so x is even. Let x = 2k, we have (3^k - 2)(3^k + 2) = 7^y so 3^k - 2 is positive and 3^k - 2 and 3^k + 2 are powers of 7.  In particular, the gcd of 3^k + 2 and 3^k - 2 divides (3^k + 2) - (3^k - 2) = 4 which is not divisible by 7, and it divides 7^y so it is 1. Since 3^k - 2 and 3^k + 2 are powers of 2 with gcd 1, the smallest one is 1, so we have 3^k - 2 = 1 so k = 1 so x = 2, we get 7^y = 3^x - 4 = 5 which is impossible.- Otherwise, n-9 = 2^y with y a positive integer, we have n-4 = 2^y + 5 = 3^x. Note that since n-4 geq 7, we have x geq 1 and y geq 1.  Here we don't have a square a priori, but we can try to get information about the parity of x and y. Since we have powers of 2 and 3, we will look modulo 3 and 4. Note that if y = 1, the equation becomes 3^x = 7, there is no solution. Since x geq 1, looking modulo 3, we have 2^y equiv -5 equiv 1 pmod{3} and the order of 2 modulo 3 is 2, so we get that y is even. Since y geq 2, we have 3^x equiv 1 pmod{4} and since the order of 3 modulo 4 is 2, x is even. We write x = 2b, y = 2c, we have 5 = (3^b - 2^c)(3^b + 2^c) so 3^b - 2^c is positive and since 3^b - 2^c < 3^b + 2^c, 3^b - 2^c and 3^b + 2^c are 1 and 5 respectively. We deduce that 3^b times 2 = (3^b + 2^c) + (3^b - 2^c) = 6 so b = 1 so x = 2, we fall back into the previous case n = 13.In particular, we have obtained that n = 13 or n < 11 and n is prime, i.e., n is 2, 3, 5, 7 or 13. Let's verify that these are solutions:- There is no prime number strictly less than 1 and 2, so 1 and 2 are solutions.- The remainder of the division of 3 by 2 is 1, which has no square factors, so 3 is a solution.- The remainders of the Euclidean divisions of 5 by 2 and 3 are 1 and 2, which are without square factors, so 5 is a solution.- The remainders of the Euclidean divisions of 7 by 2, 3, and 5 are 1, 1, and 2, which are without square factors, so 7 is a solution.- The remainders of the Euclidean divisions of 13 by 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11 are 1, 1, 3, 6, and 2, which are without square factors, so 13 is a solution.The set of solutions is therefore {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 13}.Comment from the graders: This arithmetic problem was solved by few students, all of whom demonstrated that they are extremely comfortable.

The Zmei is considered defeated if he has no heads left. Find the probability that Ilya will eventually defeat the Zmei.","solution":"Strikes by Ilya Muromets, in which the number of heads changes, are called successful.Let's find the probability that at some point there will be a last successful strike. This means that starting from this point, there will be no more successful strikes, that is, all strikes will be unsuccessful. The probability of this is 1 / 3 cdot 1 / 3 cdot 1 / 3 cdot ldots =0.Thus, there will be no last successful strike, but there will be an infinite subsequence of successful strikes, which we will consider, ignoring all other strikes.The probability of a successful strike is 2 / 3. The conditional probability that the number of heads increases when a strike is successful is 1 / 4 : 2 / 3 = 3 / 8.Similarly, the conditional probability that the number of heads decreases when a strike is successful is 5 / 12 : 2 / 3 = 5 / 8.This leads to a standard one-dimensional random walk problem. Suppose that as a result of a certain series of successful strikes, the number of heads of the Serpent has decreased by one compared to what it was. Let's call this event D, and its probability x.There are two possibilities.1) As a result of the first successful strike, the number of heads decreased by one (event M, probability 5 / 8). In this case, event D has already occurred - its conditional probability is 1.2) As a result of the first successful strike, the number of heads increases by one (event N, probability 3 / 8). In this case, event D will occur only if the number of heads decreases by 2 - by one, and then by another one. Therefore, the conditional probability of event D in this case is x^2.By the formula for total probability, x = P(D) = P(D mid M) cdot P(M) + P(D mid N) cdot P(N) = 5 / 8 + 3 / 8 x^2.From this, x = 1 or x = 5 / 3. The second root is extraneous. Therefore, event D is certain.Thus, sooner or later, the number of heads will inevitably decrease from three to two.

Therefore, the height S H of the pyramid passes either through the center of the inscribed circle or through the center of one of the exscribed circles of the base A B C. Since, by the condition of the problem, the pyramid is not regular (S A > S B), the height passes through the center H of the exscribed circle, and this circle touches the side B C and the extensions of the sides A C and A B.

Find left(p+q+r+sright)left(a+b+cright).","solution":"Solution 1We graph the 10 shots on a grid. Suppose that a made shot is represented by a step of (0,1), and a missed shot is represented by (1,0). Then the basketball player's shots can be represented by the number of paths from (0,0) to (6,4) that always stay below the line y=frac{2x}{3}. We can find the number of such paths using a Pascal's Triangle type method below, computing the number of paths to each point that only move right and up.Therefore, there are 23 ways to shoot 4 makes and 6 misses under the given conditions. The probability of each possible sequence occurring is (.4)^4(.6)^6. Hence the desired probability is[frac{23cdot 2^4cdot 3^6}{5^{10}},]and the answer is (23+2+3+5)(4+6+10)=boxed{660}.Solution 2The first restriction is that a_{10} = .4, meaning that the player gets exactly 4 out of 10 baskets.  The second restriction is a_nle.4.  This means that the player may never have a shooting average over 40%.  Thus, the first and second shots must fail, since frac{1}{1} and frac{1}{2} are both over .4, but the player may make the third basket, since frac{1}{3} le .4  In other words, the earliest the first basket may be made is attempt 3.  Using similar reasoning, the earliest the second basket may be made is attempt 5, the earliest the third basket may be made is attempt 8, and the earliest the fourth basket may be made is attempt 10.Using X to represent a basket and O to represent a failure, this 'earliest' solution may be represented as:OOXOXOOXOXTo simplify counting, note that the first, second, and tenth shots are predetermined.  The first two shots must fail, and the last shot must succeed.  Thus, only slots 3-9 need to be counted, and can be abbreviated as follows:XOXOOXOThe problem may be separated into five cases, since the first shot may be made on attempt 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

Therefore the player made 4 shots out of 10. He must make the 10th shot, because if he doesn't, then a_9=frac{4}{9}>.4. Since a_nleq .4 for all n less than 11, we know that a_1=a_2=0. Now we must look at the 3rd through 9th shot.Now let's take a look at those un-determined shots. Let's put them into groups: the 3rd, 4th, and 5th shots in group A, and the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th shots in group B. The total number of shots made in groups A and B must be 3, since the player makes the 10th shot. We cannot have all three shots made in group A, since a_5leq .4. Therefore we can have two shots made, one shot made, or no shots made in group A.Case 1: Group A contains no made shots.The number of ways this can happen in group A is 1. Now we must arrange the shots in group B accordingly. There are four ways to arrange them total, and all of them work. There are textbf{4} possibilities here.Case 2: Group A contains one made shot.The number of ways this could happen in group A is 3.  Now we must arrange the shots in group B accordingly. There are six ways to arrange them total, but the arrangement \\"hit hit miss miss\\" fails, because that would mean a_7=frac{3}{7}>.4. All the rest work. Therefore there are 3cdot5=textbf{15} possibilities here.Case 3: Group A contains two made shots.The number of ways this could happen in group A is 2 (hit hit miss doesn't work but the rest do). Now we must arrange the shots in group B accordingly. Note hit miss miss miss and miss hit miss miss fail. Therefore there are only 2 ways to do this, and there are 2cdot 2=textbf{4} total possibilities for this case.Taking all these cases into account, we find that there are 4+15+4=23 ways to have a_{10} = .4 and a_nleq .4. Each of these has a probability of .4^4cdot.6^6=frac{2^4cdot 3^6}{5^{10}}. Therefore the probability that we have a_{10} = .4 and a_nleq .4 is frac{23cdot2^4cdot3^6}{5^{10}}. Now we are asked to find the product of the sum of the primes and the sum of the exponents, which is (23+2+3+5)(4+6+10)=33cdot20=boxed{660}."},{"problem":"3.

Each number can be represented as a binary string of length ( lceil log_2(n) rceil ).   - Suppose ( k ) sheets of paper are used. Each sheet can be thought of as representing a specific bit position in the binary representation of the numbers.   - On the front of the ( i )-th sheet, write all numbers whose ( i )-th bit is ( 1 ). On the back, write all numbers whose ( i )-th bit is ( 0 ).2.

In the company, some pairs of people are friends (if A is friends with B, then B is also friends with A). It turned out that among any 100 people in the company, the number of pairs of friends is odd. Find the largest possible number of people in such a company.(E. Bakayev)","solution":"Answer: 101.Solution: In all solutions below, we consider the friendship graph, where vertices are people in the company, and two people are connected by an edge if they are friends.If the graph is a cycle containing 101 vertices, then any 100 vertices will have exactly 99 edges, so such a company satisfies the conditions of the problem. It remains to show that there cannot be a company of 102 people (then a company of more than 102 people cannot exist either). Below we provide several different ways to do this; in each way, we assume, for the sake of contradiction, that such a company has been found.First solution. Consider an arbitrary set of 101 vertices and the induced subgraph on these vertices, let it have k edges. By removing an arbitrary vertex from this subgraph (say, of degree d), we get 100 vertices with an odd number of edges k-d. Thus, the degree of any vertex in our subgraph has a parity different from the parity of k, meaning that the degrees of all vertices in the subgraph have the same parity. However, as is well known, in a graph with an odd number of vertices, all vertices cannot have an odd degree. Therefore, all these degrees are even, and the number of edges k is odd.Now let the entire graph with 102 vertices have ell edges. When any vertex (say, of degree d) is removed, we get a subgraph with an odd number of edges ell-d; similarly to the above reasoning, we get that in the entire graph, all vertices have the same parity of degrees. Note that our graph cannot be empty (i.e., have no edges) or complete (i.e., have all C_{102}^{2} edges), otherwise, on any 100 vertices, there will be either 0 or C_{100}^{2}=99 cdot 50 edges, which is an even number. Therefore, there is a vertex connected to at least one other vertex but not to all. In other words, there are vertices u, v_{1}, and v_{2} such that u is connected to v_{1} but not to v_{2}. The degrees of vertices v_{1} and v_{2} in the original graph have the same parity, so after removing u, they will have different parities. This is impossible by the above proof.Second solution. There are n=C_{102}^{2}=51 cdot 101 ways to remove two vertices from 102, leaving 100. Number these ways from 1 to n. Let a_{i} be the number of edges on the remaining 100 vertices in the i-th way; by assumption, all numbers a_{i} are odd, and thus their sum S is also odd (since the number n is odd).On the other hand, consider any edge uv. This edge is counted in the number a_{i} exactly when vertices u and v are not removed in the i-th way, i.e., when some pair of the remaining 100 vertices is removed. This happens in k=C_{100}^{2}=50 cdot 99 ways. Thus, each edge is counted in S an even number of times k, so S must be even. Contradiction.Third solution. Call a vertex even if its degree is even, and odd otherwise. Consider two cases.Case 1. Suppose the total number of edges in the graph is odd. Then, by removing any pair of vertices, we must remove an even number of edges (to leave an odd number). On the other hand, if we remove vertices with degrees d_{1} and d_{2}, the number of removed edges is d_{1}+d_{2} if these vertices are not connected by an edge, and d_{1}+d_{2}-1 if they are connected. Therefore, vertices of the same parity are never connected by an edge, and vertices of different parities are always connected.Thus, if the graph has k even vertices and ell odd vertices, even vertices have (even) degree ell, and odd vertices have (odd) degree k. This is impossible, since k+ell=102.Case 2. Suppose the total number of edges in the graph is even. Similarly, we get that vertices of the same parity are always connected by an edge, and vertices of different parities are never connected. Therefore, if the graph has k even vertices and ell odd vertices, even vertices have (even) degree k-1, and odd vertices have (odd) degree ell-1. This again contradicts the equality k+ell=102.Remark. Of course, there are other examples of a company of 101 people satisfying the condition.Comment. The statement that in any graph, the number of vertices of odd degree is even, is accepted without proof.Only the answer -0 points.Only an example of a company of 101 people satisfying the condition is provided -1 point.Noting only that to complete the solution, it is sufficient to show that the company cannot have exactly 102 people does not add points. If this observation is missed in the solution, points are not deducted.Proving only that the company cannot have 102 people -6 points.Below are some advances in proving this fact. Points for different advances do not add up; 1 point can be added for a correct example of a company of 101 people.Proving only that in any company of 101 people satisfying the condition, all vertex degrees have the same parity -2 points.In addition to this, proving that in the entire company of 102 people, all vertices have the same parity -4 points.Proving that the graph is either a complete bipartite graph or the union of two complete graphs (as shown in the third solution) -4 points.If one of the above cases is missed (without sufficient reason) -3 points instead of 4.Only one of the two cases from the third solution is fully resolved -4 points."},{"problem":"2.

Obviously among any three 7-element subsets there are two intersecting subsets.Let A be any of the 2 k+1 subsets. It intersects k other subsets B_{1}, ldots, B_{k}. The remaining subsets C_{1}, ldots, C_{k} do not intersect A and are therefore pairwise intersecting. Since each C_{i} intersects k other subsets, it intersects exactly one B_{j}. This B_{j} can not be the same for all C_{i} because B_{j} can not intersect k+1 subsets.Thus there are two different C_{i} intersecting different B_{j}; let C_{1} intersect B_{1} and C_{2} intersect B_{2}. All the subsets that do not intersect C_{1} must intersect each other; there is A among them, therefore they are A and all B_{i}, i neq 1. Hence every B_{j} and B_{j}, i neq 1, j neq 1, intersect.

The desired expected value is:   [   sum_{x=1}^{1920} x frac{binom{2020-x}{100}}{binom{2020}{101}}   ]   since once the minimum number is fixed, we have to choose 100 numbers higher than that minimum (out of 2020-x available choices).5.

We will call a pile with one stone \\"unitary,\\" and a pile with a prime number of stones - \\"prime.\\" A prime pile of p stones can only be divided into p unitary piles.For Miron to win, it is sufficient for him to repeat Varya's moves until only one pile of 10 stones remains. At this point, apart from it, there will be some number (possibly zero) n of prime piles on the table. If n is even, Miron needs to divide the last full pile into 5 piles of 2 stones each; if n is odd, then into 2 piles of 5 stones each or 10 piles of 1 stone each. Now all non-unitary piles are prime, and before Varya's move, their number is odd, while before Miron's move, it is even.

For Miron to win, he does not necessarily have to exactly repeat Varya's moves. He needs to ensure that after each of his moves, an even number of full piles remain.

The inverse proposition would be: If the alternate interior angles are equal, then the two lines are parallel. This inverse proposition is indeed true because if alternate interior angles are equal, it is a property that guarantees the lines are parallel. Therefore, this does not meet the requirement of being false.- Option B: The original statement is that vertical angles are equal. The inverse proposition would be: If two angles are equal, then they are vertical angles. This statement is false because angles can be equal without being vertical angles; they could be corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, etc., in various geometric configurations. Thus, this inverse proposition is false and meets the question's requirement.- Option C: The original statement is that in a right triangle, the two acute angles are complementary. The inverse proposition would be: If two angles are complementary, then they form a right triangle. This statement is true because the definition of complementary angles is two angles whose sum is 90 degrees, which necessarily implies that if they are in a triangle, that triangle must have a right angle. Hence, this does not meet the requirement of being false.- Option D: The original statement is that the supplements of the same angle are equal. The inverse proposition would be: If two angles have equal supplements, then they are the same angle. This statement is true because if two angles have equal supplements, then by definition, they add up to 180 degrees with their respective supplements, implying they must be equal angles themselves.

Solution Put u = x 2 y+y 2 z+z 2 x, v = xy 2 +yz 2 +zx 2 , and w = xyz. We have 0 = (x+y+z) 2 = x 2 +y 2 +z 2 +2(xy+yz+zx), so xy+yz+zx = -3.

Also (x+y+z)(xy+yz+zx) = u+v+3w, so u+v = -3w. Multiplying out, we find uv = (x 3 y 3 +y 3 z 3 +z 3 x 3 ) + 3x 2 y 2 z 2 + xyz(x 3 +y 3 +z 3 ) = -27 + 3w 2 + 3w 2 + 3w 2 = 9w 2 - 27. Hence u is a root of the quadratic u 2 + 3wu + (9w 2 -27) = 0. Completing the square in w (not u) we get (3w + u/2) 2 + 3u 2 /4 - 27 = 0, so 3u 2 /4 - 27 ≤ 0 and hence u ≤ 6. For equality we need w = -1. Remembering that x+y+z = 0, xy+yz+zx = -3, x, y, z are the roots of k 3 - 3k + 1 = 0. If we put k = 2 cos θ, then 8 cos 3 θ - 6 cos θ + 1 = 0. But cos 3θ = 4 cos 3 θ - 3 cos θ, so cos 3θ = -1/2. Hence 3θ = 2π/3, 4π/3 or 8π/3, so x, y, z = 2 cos 2π/9, 2 cos 4π/9, 2 cos 8π/9. Comment. This is all fairly unmotivated.

Let's choose a vertex A of the highest degree n and consider the subgraph G formed by the vertices to which edges from A lead. It is clear that there are no edges in this subgraph.

Thus, the total number of edges in the original graph does not exceed n(30-n) leq 15^{2}.Example. Divide 30 vertices into two groups of 15 and draw all edges connecting vertices from different groups. The resulting graph has no triangles and has 225 edges.b) Estimate.

The sum of the numbers in each row (and in each column) is even, equaling twice the largest of the three written numbers. Therefore, the sum of all the numbers in the table must also be even. Since in case a) the sum of the numbers is 45, the task cannot be completed.Since the sum of the numbers in case b) is even (10 cdot 11 / 2 - 1 = 54), we will try to fill the table in the required manner. Among the nine given numbers, there are five even numbers (which we will denote by the symbol S) and four odd numbers (which we will denote by the symbol L). Symbolically, then, in each row and column, one of the equations S = L + L, S = S + S, or L = S + L must hold. If we look at the number of even and odd numbers used in these equations and also consider that we must use more even numbers than odd ones, we conclude that at least one row and one column must be of the type S = S + S.We can swap the rows of our table among themselves without violating the condition given in the problem. The same applies to the columns. We can therefore assume that both the first row and the first column contain only even numbers (they are of the type S = S + S). Let's look at their common cell (the top left corner of the table), in which one of the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 must be written.We will list for each of the five candidates all the suitable equations to meet the condition of the problem for the first column and the first row:begin{gathered}2 = 6 - 4 = 8 - 6 = 10 - 8, quad 4 = 6 - 2 = 10 - 6, quad 6 = 2 + 4 = 8 - 2 = 10 - 4, 8 = 2 + 6 = 10 - 2, quad 10 = 8 + 2 = 6 + 4 .end{gathered}We see that only the numbers 4 and 8 cannot be written in two \\"disjoint\\" ways, so in the common cell, one of the numbers 2, 6, or 10 must be written, and the table must then be (up to the order of rows, columns, and possibly flipping along the diagonal) filled with even numbers in one of three ways (asterisks here denote the four odd numbers 3, 5, 7, 9 written in some order), which we will further examine:| 2 | 8 | 10 || :---: | :---: | :---: || 4 | * | * || 6 | * | * |Type A| 6 | 2 | 8 || :---: | :---: | :---: || 4 | * | * || 10 | * | * |Type B| 10 | 4 | 6 || :---: | :---: | :---: || 2 | * | * || 8 | * | * |Type CIn the table of type A, we would have to have 8 = 3 + 5 and 10 = 3 + 7 in the 2nd and 3rd columns, but the number 3 cannot be in both columns, so the required filling of the table of type A does not exist.In the table of type B, we have the numbers 8 and 10 again in the 3rd row and 3rd column, and from the already mentioned equations, we see that the table can be completed in only one suitable way| 6 | 2 | 8 || :---: | :---: | :---: || 4 | 9 | 5 || 10 | 7 | 3 |rightarrow| 2 | 6 | 8 || :---: | :---: | :---: || 7 | 10 | 3 || 9 | 4 | 5 |We have already transformed the table (by first swapping the first column with the second and then the second row with the third) into one of the possible forms where the number 10 stands in the middle of the table, as required by the problem.Finally, in the table of type C, we have only one way to express 8 = 5 + 3 in the 3rd row and 6 = 9 - 3 in the 3rd column. This determines the position of not only the numbers 3, 5, and 9, but also the remaining number 7. The resulting table clearly does not meet the problem's requirements.It remains to determine the number of different tables that can be created from the filled table of type B so that the number 10 is in the middle. In the middle row or column, along with 10, there must be the numbers 6 and 4, or 7 and 3, respectively, so we have a total of 4 cdot 2 = 8 possibilities (we place the 6 in one of the four fields adjacent to the middle 10, the 4 will then be in the opposite field, the 7 will be placed in one of the two remaining fields adjacent to the 10; the numbers in the corner fields are then uniquely determined)."},{"problem":"4.

Since the sum of the measures of an interior angle and its adjacent exterior angle is always 180^{circ} (because they are supplementary), we can set up the equation:[x + 5x = 180^{circ}]Simplifying this equation, we get:[6x = 180^{circ}]Dividing both sides by 6 to solve for x, we find:[x = frac{180^{circ}}{6} = 30^{circ}]Knowing that the sum of all exterior angles of any polygon is 360^{circ}, and now that we have found each exterior angle to be 30^{circ}, we can determine the number of sides (n) of the polygon by dividing the total sum of exterior angles by the measure of one exterior angle:[n = frac{360^{circ}}{30^{circ}} = 12]Therefore, the polygon is a dodecagon, which has 12 sides.

The probability P_{ij} represents the likelihood that elements i and j are both present in the sample.Since 1 in {1, 2, 3, ldots, m} and n in {m+1, m+2, ldots, n}, the probability that element 1 is chosen from the first subpopulation is determined by the number of ways to choose the second element from the remaining m-1 elements in the first subpopulation. Similarly for element n in the second subpopulation.Therefore, the expression for P_{1n} is given by:P_{1n} = frac {C_{m-1}^{1}}{C_m^2} times frac {C_{n-m-1}^{1}}{C_{n-m}^2} = frac {(m-1)(n-m-1)}{C_m^2 C_{n-m}^2}Simplifying the expression, we get:P_{1n} = frac{(m-1)(n-m-1)}{frac{m(m-1)}{2} times frac{(n-m)(n-m-1)}{2}} = frac {4}{m(n-m)}So, the expression for P_{1n} is boxed{ frac{4}{m(n-m)}}.2.

There are m(n-m) different ways to select such pairs (i, j), resulting in a combined probability sum of 4.Therefore, the total sum of all P_{ij} is the sum of the probabilities from the three cases:text{Sum of all } P_{ij} = 1 + 1 + 4 = boxed{6}."},{"problem":"14.

Rewrite the given equation of the circle: The given equation is x^{2}+y^{2}-4x-2y+1=0. To rewrite it in the standard form of a circle's equation, we complete the squares for x and y:   [   x^{2}-4x+y^{2}-2y+1=0 implies (x^{2}-4x+4)+(y^{2}-2y+1)=4   ]   This simplifies to:   [   (x-2)^{2}+(y-1)^{2}=4   ]   Therefore, the circle C can be rewritten as (x-2)^{2}+(y-1)^{2}=4.2. Identify the center and radius of the circle: From the rewritten equation, we identify the center of the circle C as (2,1) and the radius r=2.3. Determine the intersection with the x-axis: The distance from the center (2,1) to the x-axis is the absolute value of the y-coordinate of the center, which is |1-0|=1. Since this distance 1 is less than the radius 2, the circle intersects the x-axis at two distinct points.4. Determine the intersection with the y-axis: The distance from the center (2,1) to the y-axis is the absolute value of the x-coordinate of the center, which is |2-0|=2. This distance is equal to the radius of the circle, indicating that the circle is tangent to the y-axis. Therefore, there is exactly one intersection point with the y-axis.5. Conclusion: Combining the intersections, we find that the coordinate axes intersect the circle at a total of 3 points: two on the x-axis and one on the y-axis.Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{C}."},{"problem":"Given c>0, let p: y=c^x is monotonically decreasing on mathbb{R}, and q: the range of g(x)=ln(2cx^2-2x+1) is mathbb{R}.

This tells us that four of her marks were 50,76,76,94.Since the median of her marks is 76 and she has six marks in total (that is, an even number of marks), then the two marks of 76 must be 3rd and 4th when the marks are arranged in increasing order. Let the second lowest mark be M, and the second highest be N. So the second lowest mark M is between (but not equal to) 50 and 76, and the second highest mark N is between (but not equal to) 76 and 94. We still need to use the fact that the mean of Veronica's marks is 74 , sobegin{aligned}frac{50+M+76+76+N+94}{6} & =74 M+N+296 & =444 M+N & =148 M & =148-Nend{aligned}We know already that M is one of 51 through 75, but the possibilities for N and the equation (*) restrict these possibilities further.Since N can be any of 77 through 93 , there are exactly 17 possibilities for N.

Every minute thereafter, Denys writes the number a+b between all pairs of consecutive numbers a, b on the board. How many odd numbers will be on the board after 10 such operations?[i]Proposed by Michael Kural[/i]","solution":"1. Reduction to modulo 2:    We start by reducing all numbers to pmod{2}. This is valid because the parity (odd or even nature) of the numbers will determine the number of odd numbers on the board.2. Define variables:   Let a_n be the number of 00, b_n be the number of 01, c_n be the number of 10, and d_n be the number of 11 in adjacent pairs after n operations.3. Lemma 1:    [   a_n + b_n + c_n + d_n = 2^n   ]   Proof:    The number of numbers on the board after n operations satisfies the recurrence A_n = 2A_{n-1} - 1. This is because each number generates a new number between each pair, doubling the count and then subtracting 1 for the overlap. Solving this recurrence with A_1 = 3, we get A_n = 2^n + 1. Therefore, the number of adjacent pairs is A_n - 1 = 2^n.4. Lemma 2:    [   a_n = 0, quad b_{n+1} = b_n + d_n, quad c_{n+1} = c_n + d_n, quad d_{n+1} = b_n + c_n   ]   Proof:    The operations map as follows:   [   00 mapsto 000, quad 01 mapsto 011, quad 10 mapsto 110, quad 11 mapsto 101   ]   From these mappings, we see that a_{n+1} = 2a_n. Since a_1 = 0, we have a_n = 0 for all n. The other recurrences follow from the mappings without overcounts.5. Lemma 3:    Let the number of 1s after n operations be X_n. Then,   [   X_n = X_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}   ]   Proof:    The mappings 01 mapsto 011 and 10 mapsto 110 each add one more 1. Thus, the number of 1s increases by the number of 01 and 10 pairs.6. Lemma 4:    Let k_n = b_n + c_n. Then,   [   k_n = frac{2}{3} cdot 2^n + frac{1}{3} cdot (-1)^n   ]   Proof:    We have the recurrence:   [   k_n = b_n + c_n = b_{n-1} + c_{n-1} + 2d_{n-1} = k_{n-1} + 2k_{n-2}   ]   The characteristic equation for this recurrence is:   [   x^2 - x - 2 = 0   ]   Solving this, we get the roots x = 2 and x = -1. Using initial conditions k_1 = 1 and k_2 = 3, we find:   [   k_n = frac{2}{3} cdot 2^n + frac{1}{3} cdot (-1)^n   ]7.

Define the sequence: A sequence is quadratic if for each ( i in {1, 2, ldots, n} ), we have ( |a_i - a_{i-1}| = i^2 ).3. Express the difference: Let ( d_i = a_i - a_{i-1} ). Then ( |d_i| = i^2 ).4. Sum of differences: The total change from ( a_0 ) to ( a_n ) is:   [   a_n - a_0 = sum_{i=1}^n d_i   ]   We need to show that ( sum_{i=1}^n d_i = c - b ).5.

One can easily find that f(1)=41 is a prime, then f becomes negative for n between 2 and 18, and then f(19)=761 is again a prime number. And as 41 + 761 = 802 is already the largest option, the answer must be boxed{802}.Solution 2We will now show a complete solution, with a proof that no other values are prime. Consider the function g(x) = x^2 - 360x + 400, then obviously f(x) = g(x^2).The roots of g are:[x_{1,2}  = frac{ 360 pm sqrt{ 360^2 - 4cdot 400 } }2  = 180 pm 80 sqrt 5]We can then write g(x) = (x - 180 - 80sqrt 5)(x - 180 + 80sqrt 5), and thus f(x) = (x^2 - 180 - 80sqrt 5)(x^2 - 180 + 80sqrt 5).We would now like to factor the right hand side further, using the formula (x^2 - y^2) = (x-y)(x+y). To do this, we need to express both constants as squares of some other constants. Luckily, we have a pretty good idea how they look like.We are looking for rational a and b such that (a+bsqrt 5)^2 = 180 + 80sqrt 5. Expanding the left hand side and comparing coefficients, we get ab=40 and a^2 + 5b^2 = 180. We can easily guess (or compute) the solution a=10, b=4.Hence 180 + 80sqrt 5 = (10 + 4sqrt 5)^2, and we can easily verify that also 180 - 80sqrt 5 = (10 - 4sqrt 5)^2.We now know the complete factorization of f(x): [f(x) = (x - 10 - 4sqrt 5)(x + 10 + 4sqrt 5)(x - 10 + 4sqrt 5)(x + 10 - 4sqrt 5)]As the final step, we can now combine the factors in a different way, in order to get rid of the square roots. We have (x - 10 - 4sqrt 5)(x - 10 + 4sqrt 5) = (x-10)^2 - (4sqrt 5)^2 = x^2 - 20x + 20,and (x + 10 - 4sqrt 5)(x + 10 + 4sqrt 5) = x^2 + 20x + 20.Hence we obtain the factorization f(x) = (x^2 - 20x + 20)(x^2 + 20x + 20).For xgeq 20 both terms are positive and larger than one, hence f(x) is not prime. For 1<x<19 the second factor is positive and the first one is negative, hence f(x) is not a prime. The remaining cases are x=1 and x=19. In both cases, f(x) is indeed a prime, and their sum is f(1) + f(19) = 41 + 761 = boxed{802}.Solution 3Instead of doing the hard work, we can try to guess the factorization. One good approach:We can make the observation that f(x) looks similar to (x^2 + 20)^2 with the exception of the x^2 term. In fact, we have (x^2 + 20)^2 = x^4 + 40x^2 + 400. But then we notice that it differs from the desired expression by a square: f(x) = (x^2 + 20)^2 - 400x^2 = (x^2 + 20)^2 - (20x)^2.Now we can use the formula (x^2 - y^2) = (x-y)(x+y) to obtain the same factorization as in the previous solution, without all the work.Solution 4After arriving at the factorization f(x) = (x^2 - 20x + 20)(x^2 + 20x + 20), a more mathematical approach would be to realize that the second factor is always positive when x is a positive integer. Therefore, in order for f(x) to be prime, the first factor has to be 1.We can set it equal to 1 and solve for x: x^2-20x+20=1x^2-20x+19=0(x-1)(x-19)=0x=1, x=19Substituting these values into the second factor and adding would give the answer."},{"problem":"For every 3 chocolates that Claire buys at the regular price, she buys a fourth chocolate for 25 cents.

Suppose the last time A changes the sign of the sum (including changing from 0 to positive) is the k-th time A fills in a symbol.

The sum of the numbers on each arc is divisible by the product of the numbers on the next arc in the clockwise direction. What is the greatest possible value of the largest of the written numbers?","solution":"We will prove that the numbers on the circle do not exceed 2001.Lemma 1. Let ( x ) and ( y ) be natural numbers. If ( xy = x + y ), then ( x = y = 2 ), and if ( x > 0, y > 0, x leq y ), then the sum ( x + y ) decreases as ( x ) increases.Proof. This follows from the decrease of the function ( f(x) = x + frac{c}{x} = left(sqrt{frac{c}{x}} - xright)^2 + 2sqrt{c} ), where ( c > 0 ), on the interval ( (0, sqrt{c}) ).Divide the sum of the numbers in each pair by the product of the numbers in the next (clockwise) pair and multiply the resulting quotients. By the condition, we get an integer. On the other hand, this product is the product of numbers of the form ( frac{a+b}{ab} ). From this and Lemma 1, it follows that if at least one pair is different from (2, 2), then there is a pair of the form (1, ( k )). Start with this pair and move clockwise around the circle. First case. Subsequent pairs have the form (1, ( k+1 )), (1, ( k+2 )), ..., (1, ( k+999 )). Thus, ( k+1000 ) is divisible by ( k ), from which 1000 is divisible by ( k ). But then ( k leq 1000 ) and ( k+999 leq 1999 ).Second case. There is a pair of the form (1, ( l )) such that the next pair ( (a, b) ) is different from (1, ( l+1 )). By the condition, ( ab ) is a divisor of the number ( s_1 = 1 + l ). If ( ab = l + 1 ), then by Lemma 2, ( s_2 = a + b leq 2 + frac{1}{2}(l + 1) ).If ( ab leq frac{1}{2}(l + 1) ), then by Lemma 2, ( a + b leq 1 + frac{1}{2}(l + 1) ). Therefore, in this case, inequality (*) also holds. For the next pair ( (c, d) ), Lemma 2 gives ( s_3 = c + d leq cd + 1 leq 3 + frac{1}{2}(l + 1) ), and so on. For the sum ( s_{1000} ) of the numbers in the pair preceding (1, ( l )), we get[ s_{1000} leq 1000 + frac{1}{2}(l + 1). ]On the other hand, ( s_{1000} ) is divisible by ( l ), so ( s_{1000} geq l ). The last two inequalities give ( l leq 2001 ). Then from the above estimates, it follows that for any pair different from (1, ( l )), the inequality ( s leq 2001 ) holds. Therefore, each number in these pairs does not exceed 2000.Thus, the estimate of 2001 is proven.

Find the largest value of n for which this is possible.","solution":"Solution to Exercise 5: We will show that it is not possible for ( n geqslant 5 ), and that it is possible for ( n leqslant 4 ).To do this, we first observe that if it is possible for an ( n ), it is possible for all ( k leqslant n ). Indeed, if we take an ( n times n ) grid satisfying the hypotheses, and then restrict ourselves to the sub-grid formed by the first ( k ) rows and columns, this sub-grid also satisfies the hypotheses. Therefore, to conclude, it suffices to show that it is not possible for ( n=5 ) and to provide a construction for ( n=4 ).In the case ( n=5 ), consider a ( 5 times 5 ) colored grid. For each column, there is at least one color present at least 3 times, according to the pigeonhole principle. Therefore, there are 3 columns for which this color is the same (by symmetry, let's say 3 columns containing at least 3 white cells), for the same reason. Let's call these columns ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ). There are at least 3 white cells in column ( a ), and we call the rows ( x ), ( y ), and ( z ). If column ( b ) or column ( c ) contains at least 2 white cells in rows ( x ), ( y ), and ( z ), then (for example, if cells ((b, x)) and ((b, y)) are white) the intersections of rows ( x ) and ( y ) with columns ( a ) and ( b ) are all white. Otherwise, on each of the two columns ( b ) and ( c ), the cells in the last two rows are white, and thus by considering these two rows and columns ( b ) and ( c ), we find that the grid does not satisfy the hypothesis.For the case ( n=4 ), the following construction works:![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_7f99ab0e41c82ac4a4c9g-06.jpg?height=422&width=437&top_left_y=1296&top_left_x=844)Grader Comments: For this exercise, the writing is often unclear.

However, often students do not identify enough symmetries in the problem to reduce it to a single case. A tip to avoid mistakes is to specify which generality is preserved before using the phrase, to ensure that one has not overused the formula. For example, in the case ( n=5 ): \\"There are three cells of the same color in the first column. Without loss of generality, and by swapping the color of each cell in the grid, we can assume that these three cells are white.\\" However, after writing this, we are no longer allowed to make the same assumption for the three cells of the same color in the second column."},{"problem":"Write the proposition \\"A quadrilateral with four equal sides is a square\\" in the form of \\"if p then q\\", and write its converse, inverse, and contrapositive propositions.

Transformation of the Variable: Given the domain for x as x∈[-frac{2π}{3},frac{2π}{3}], we can transform the variable by setting t=cos x. This transformation bounds t within the interval [-frac{1}{2},1] because the cosine function achieves its maximum value of 1 and minimum value of -frac{1}{2} within the given domain for x.2. Expression Simplification: The function in terms of t becomes f(t)={(1+t)}^{2023}+{(1-t)}^{2023}. By applying the binomial theorem, this simplifies to 2+2{C}_{2023}^{2}{t}^{2}+2{C}_{2023}^{4}{t}^{4}+cdots+2{C}_{2023}^{2022}{t}^{2022}. This simplification reveals that f(t) is an even function, which means f(t)=f(-t).3. Analysis of f(t): Since f(t) is even, we can focus on the interval tin [0,1] without loss of generality. Within this interval, f(t) is monotonically increasing because each term in the expanded form of f(t) increases as t increases from 0 to 1.4. Finding the Range of f(t):    - The minimum value of f(t) occurs at t=0, which gives f(t)_{min }=f(0)=2.   - The maximum value of f(t) occurs at t=1, which gives f(t)_{max}=f(1)={2}^{2023}.5. Conclusion: The range of the function y=left(1+cos xright)^{2023}+left(1-cos xright)^{2023}, given x∈[-frac{2π}{3},frac{2π}{3}], is therefore [2,2^{2023}].Therefore, the answer is: boxed{[2,2^{2023}]}."},{"problem":"8.

Suppose it has length ( m ) (this may be zero).   - Step 3: Assign the next ( m+1 ) values unassigned to ( tau ) (in left to right order) the values [m+n, m+n-1, dots, n]   - Step 4: Replace ( n ) with ( n+m+1 ). If ( n geq 101 ), stop. Otherwise, go to Step 2.6. Validity of Algorithm: The above algorithm creates a valid permutation with its ( S )-value being ( s_1s_2 dots s_{99} ).7. Conversion to Target Permutation: Show that each permutation ( sigma ) of ( [100] ) can be converted to ( tauleft(S(sigma)right) ) after a sequence of operations. Fix any permutation ( sigma ) and consider the following:   - If there are two integers ( m ) and ( m+1 ) such that ( m+1 ) appears before ( m ) in ( sigma ) and are not adjacent, swap them.   - Else, stop.8. Termination of Process: The above process cannot go on indefinitely. If it did, some number in ( [100] ) would move back infinitely often, which is impossible since there are only 100 places it could have been in. Thus, we stop at some stage and ( sigma ) becomes some new permutation ( sigma' ).9. Claim 2: ( sigma' equiv tauleft(S(sigma)right) ).   Proof: We will use induction. Let the location of ( 1 ) in the permutation ( sigma' ) be in the ( i )-th position. Now ( 2 ) is either after ( 1 ) or before ( 1 ). Suppose ( 2, 3, dots, m ) all lie to the left of ( 1 ) consecutively with ( m ) maximal. We show that ( sigma' ) starts with ( m ) and thus we may induct down to the permutation after ( 1 ) by shifting all the values down by ( m ). Suppose there are numbers before ( m ) and let ( n ) be the smallest among them. Then ( n-1 ) lies to the right of the ( [m, dots, 1] ) block and we could have swapped ( n ) for ( n-1 ); a contradiction. Thus, we can induct down and prove the claim. (blacksquare)10. Conclusion: With the two claims in hand, it is clear that each connected component of ( G ) is described by the string value each vertex has. It follows that the number of connected components of ( G ) is the number of strings in ( {<, >}^{99} ), which is ( 2^{99} ).The final answer is ( boxed{ 2^{99} } )."},{"problem":"In triangle ABC, angle C= frac{pi}{2}, angle B= frac{pi}{6}, and AC=2.

Note that all these 100 routes must be distinct and must be distinct from R and S (or we would have more than one route through two stops). But any route T must have a stop in common with R and a stop in common with S. If neither of those stops is X, then it must pass through some R i and some S j , so it must be the route (R i , S j ). If it passes through X, then it cannot have any other stops in common with R or S. But it must have a stop in common with Q = (R 1 , S 1 ). Q has 9 other stops, call them Q 1 , Q 2 , ..., Q 9 . So T must pass through X and some Q i . But there is a unique route (X, Q i ) through X and Q i . Thus we have R, S, 10 2 routes (R i , S j ), and 9 routes (X, Q i ), total 111.

We need to find the largest positive integer ( n ) such that ( n ) cannot be expressed as the sum of a positive integral multiple of 42 and a positive composite integer. In other words, we need ( n ) such that ( n = 42k + c ) where ( k ) is a positive integer and ( c ) is a positive composite integer.2. We start by considering the sequence of numbers of the form ( 42k + n ) for ( k geq 0 ). We need to ensure that none of these numbers are composite for ( k geq 1 ).3. We first consider the smallest primes less than 42, as these will be the starting points for our sequences. The primes less than 42 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, and 41.4. We need to find a sequence of primes ( p_1, p_2, p_3, ldots ) such that ( p_i equiv p_1 pmod{42} ) and ( p_i ) is prime for all ( i ). The sequence must start with a prime less than 42.5.

Area of the triangle ( ABC ):   If ( A = (a, b) ), ( B = (c, d) ), and ( C = (e, f) ), the area ( K ) of the triangle ( ABC ) can be calculated using the determinant formula:   [   K = frac{1}{2} left| a(d - f) + c(f - b) + e(b - d) right|   ]   Therefore, ( K^2 ) is:   [   K^2 = frac{1}{4} left( a(d - f) + c(f - b) + e(b - d) right)^2   ]3. Expected value of ( K^2 ):   We need to find the expected value ( E(K^2) ). Using the linearity of expectation and symmetry, we can write:   [   E(K^2) = frac{1}{4} E left( left( a(d - f) + c(f - b) + e(b - d) right)^2 right)   ]4. Expanding the square:   [   left( a(d - f) + c(f - b) + e(b - d) right)^2 = a^2(d - f)^2 + c^2(f - b)^2 + e^2(b - d)^2 + 2a(d - f)c(f - b) + 2a(d - f)e(b - d) + 2c(f - b)e(b - d)   ]5. Using symmetry and independence:   By symmetry and independence of the points, the cross terms (like ( 2a(d - f)c(f - b) )) will have an expected value of zero because the expectation of a product of independent random variables where one has mean zero is zero. Therefore, we only need to consider the terms involving squares:   [   E(K^2) = frac{1}{4} left( E(a^2(d - f)^2) + E(c^2(f - b)^2) + E(e^2(b - d)^2) right)   ]6. Calculating ( E(a^2(d - f)^2) ):   Since ( a, d, f ) are chosen independently from (-4) to (4), we have:   [   E(a^2) = frac{1}{9} sum_{i=-4}^{4} i^2 = frac{1}{9} cdot 60 = frac{60}{9} = frac{20}{3}   ]   Similarly, for ( d ) and ( f ):   [   E((d - f)^2) = E(d^2) + E(f^2) - 2E(df) = 2E(d^2) - 2E(d)E(f) = 2 cdot frac{20}{3} = frac{40}{3}   ]7. Combining the results:   [   E(a^2(d - f)^2) = E(a^2) cdot E((d - f)^2) = frac{20}{3} cdot frac{40}{3} = frac{800}{9}   ]   Since the same calculation applies to the other terms:   [   E(K^2) = frac{1}{4} left( 3 cdot frac{800}{9} right) = frac{1}{4} cdot frac{2400}{9} = frac{600}{9} = frac{200}{3}   ]The final answer is (boxed{frac{200}{3}})."},{"problem":"6.

A point moves along the edges of the cube A B C D A^{prime} B^{prime} C^{prime} D^{prime}. From any vertex, it can move to one of the three edges (emanating from this vertex) at random with equal probability, equal to 1 / 3. The vertices B^{prime} and C^{prime} are special in that, once the point reaches either of them, it stops moving. If the point starts moving from vertex A, what is the probability that it: 1) stops at vertex B^{prime} ; 2 ) stops at vertex C^{prime}; 3) never reaches either vertex B^{prime} or vertex C^{prime}?","solution":"27.12. Note that from any vertex of the cube, the point will land in one of the vertices B^{prime}, C^{prime} with a probability not less than 1 / 9 (since for any vertex of the cube, different from B^{prime} and C^{prime}, there exists a route passing through no more than two edges and connecting it to B^{prime} or C^{prime}). Therefore, the probability that the point does not land in either B^{prime} or C^{prime} in two moves is no more than 1-1 / 9=8 / 9, and the probability that the point does not land in either B^{prime} or C^{prime} in 2 k moves is no more than (8 / 9)^{k}. Consequently, the probability that the point never lands in either B^{prime} or C^{prime} does not exceed (8 / 9)^{k} for any k in N, and thus is 0. Therefore, the point will land in B^{prime} or C^{prime} with probability 1. Next, let p denote the probability that the point will land in B^{prime} from A (and, therefore, with probability 1-p the point will land in C^{prime} from A), and let q denote the probability that the point will land in B^{prime} from B (and, therefore, with probability 1-q the point will land in C^{prime} from B). By symmetry, the probability that the point will land in B^{prime} from D is (1-p), from A^{prime} in B^{prime} is q, and from C or D^{prime} in B^{prime} is (1-q). If the point is at A, then with probability 1 / 3 it will land in A^{prime}, with probability 1 / 3 it will land in D, and with probability 1 / 3 it will land in B. Therefore, the probability rho that the point will land in B^{prime} from A isfrac{1}{3}(1-p)+frac{1}{3} q+frac{1}{3} qi.e., 4 p-2 q=1. Similarly, the probability q that the point will land in B^{prime} from B is frac{1}{3}+frac{1}{3}(1-q)+frac{1}{3} p, i.e., 4 q-p=2.

Eliminate the denominators: To do this, we cross-multiply, which gives us (x+2)(1-x) = m(x-1). Simplifying the left side, we get x+2 = -mx + m because 1-x = -(x-1).2. Determine the condition for the equation to have a root: The equation has a root when the denominator on both sides is not zero, which means x-1 neq 0 and 1-x neq 0. Both conditions lead to x neq 1. However, for the equation to make sense and to find the specific value of m, we consider the scenario where the equation simplifies to a form where x can be substituted. Thus, we mistakenly considered x-1=0 to find a specific solution, which should be corrected to finding a value of x that satisfies both sides of the equation after eliminating denominators correctly.3. Correcting the approach: The correct step after eliminating denominators should focus on equating the numerators correctly, which leads to a misunderstanding in the initial solution. The correct approach is to realize that eliminating denominators as described initially was incorrect. Instead, we should equate the numerators directly due to the mistake in the process described. 4. Find the value of m directly: Given the mistake in the process, we directly look at the conditions set by the equation. The equation frac{x+2}{x-1}=frac{m}{1-x} implies that for the equation to hold true without finding a specific x, we need to ensure the numerators and denominators are proportionally equivalent. This means x+2 must be directly proportional to m in the same way x-1 is to 1-x. This leads to a misunderstanding in the solution process.5. Correct solution: Recognizing the error in the process, we see that the initial step to eliminate denominators was incorrectly described, and the subsequent steps led to a confusion. The correct process involves equating the numerators after understanding that x+2 and m must be related in a way that does not depend on finding a specific value of x by setting x-1=0. Therefore, the correct interpretation of solving the equation frac{x+2}{x-1}=frac{m}{1-x} involves recognizing the error in the solution process and understanding that the value of m should be determined by the relationship between the numerators and denominators directly, without incorrectly setting x-1=0 to find x=1. Given the confusion in the explanation and the realization that the solution provided does not follow a logical step-by-step process as intended, we acknowledge the mistake in the explanation. The correct approach should involve a direct comparison of the terms after correctly applying the principles of proportionality in the equation, without incorrectly assuming a value for x.However, following the steps provided in the solution despite the misunderstanding:- We incorrectly set x-1=0 to find x=1.- Substituting x=1 into x+2 gives us 1+2=3.- This led to the incorrect conclusion that -m=3, and thus m=-3.Given the errors in the process, the final answer provided was m=-3, which was derived from a flawed process.

Let's write this as![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_b937612abb2773f7abffg-104.jpg?height=102&width=307&top_left_y=1246&top_left_x=404)From this, it is clear that x=2. If we write this value in the dividend and the quotient, we can find the second digit of the quotient; using it, we can find the third digit of the dividend; from this, we can find the third digit of the quotient, and so on. The process will end when the last obtained digit of the quotient is 7, and the written dividend is divisible by 3 without a remainder.It is easy to see that this number is the desired one, since if we move the 7 from the beginning to the end in it, we get the number we wrote as the quotient, i.e., one-third of it.Since up to this point we were necessarily obtaining the next digit from the already written ones, the indicated number will be the smallest with the required property. The calculations can be arranged as follows: in the top line, we will write the digits of the dividend, in the second line - the number, dividing which by 3 gives the next digit of the quotient, and in the third line - this digit; begin{array}{llllllllllllllllllll}7 & 2 & 4 & 1 & 3 & 7 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 0 & 3 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 2 & 7 & 5 & 8 & 6 & 2end{array} 71241123279311013142482217251862 begin{array}{llllllllllllllllllll}2 & 4 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 0 & 3 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 2 & 7 & 5 & 8 & 6 & 2 & 0end{array}begin{array}{rrrrrrrrr}0 & 6 & 8 & 9 & 6 & 5 & 5 & 1 20 & 26 & 28 & 19 & 16 & 15 & 5 & 21 6 & 8 & 9 & 6 & 5 & 5 & 1 & 7end{array}Thus, the smallest number with the required property is: 7241379310344827586206896551.Third solution. Analogously to the first solution of problem 34 a), using similar notation, we will have:left(7 cdot 10^{m}+Xright) cdot frac{1}{3}=10 X+7from whichX=frac{7 cdot 10^{m}-21}{29}Thus, the problem reduces to determining a number of the form 70000 ldots which, when divided by 29, gives a remainder of 21. We leave it to the reader to verify that in this case, we arrive at the same result as in the first two solutions.Note. Similarly, we can solve the following problem:Find the smallest number starting with a known digit that decreases by 3 times when the first digit is moved to the end. To be able to search for solutions starting with the digits 1 and 2, we will assume that 0 can stand at the beginning of the number.If the number starts with the digit 0, it is easy to verify that the only number with the required property is 0. Let's write down the other numbers with this property:| 1 | 034 | 482 | 758 | 620 | 689 | 655 | 172 | 413 | 793 || :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- || 2 | 068 | 965 | 517 | 241 | 379 | 310 | 344 | 827 | 586 || 3 | 103 | 448 | 275 | 862 | 068 | 965 | 517 | 241 | 379 || 4 | 137 | 931 | 034 | 482 | 758 | 620 | 689 | 655 | 172 || 5 | 172 | 413 | 793 | 103 | 448 | 275 | 862 | 068 | 965 || 6 | 206 | 896 | 551 | 724 | 137 | 931 | 034 | 482 | 758 || 8 | 275 | 862 | 068 | 965 | 517 | 241 | 379 | 310 | 344 || 9 | 310 | 344 | 827 | 586 | 206 | 896 | 551 | 724 | 137 |In the same way, we can solve the problem:Find the smallest integer starting with a given digit a and decreasing by moving this digit to the end by a factor of 3.

Calculate the maximum real part:   The maximum real part of the sum is:   [   Re(z_0) + Re(z_1) + Re(z_2) + Re(z_3) + Re(z_{10}) + Re(z_{11}) + Re(z_7) + Re(z_8) + Re(z_9) + Re(z_4) + Re(z_5) + Re(z_6)   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   2Re(z_{11}) + 2Re(z_{12}) + 2Re(z_1) = 2(8) + 4(8cos(30^circ)) = 16 + 16sqrt{3}   ]   Therefore, the maximum possible value of the real part of ( sum_{j=1}^{12} w_j ) is:   [   16 + 16sqrt{3}   ]   This can be written as ( m + sqrt{n} ) where ( m = 16 ) and ( n = 768 ).The final answer is ( 16 + 768 = boxed{784} )"}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(i=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return i.problem.toLowerCase().includes(e)||i.solution.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},I={class:"card-container"},z=["disabled"],E={key:0},M={key:1};function L(i,e,h,d,o,r){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔 AI effective tips collection 🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),g(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,o.searchQuery]])]),t("div",I,[(a(!0),n(x,null,y(r.filteredPoems,(s,u)=>(a(),w(m,{key:u,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:o.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...s)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...s))},[o.isLoading?(a(),n("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),n("span",E,"See more"))],8,z)):_("",!0)])}const O=f(F,[["render",L],["__scopeId","data-v-4c8462d6"]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/48.md","filePath":"drive/48.md"}'),N={name:"drive/48.md"},R=Object.assign(N,{setup(i){return(e,h)=>(a(),n("div",null,[v(O)]))}});export{W as __pageData,R as default};
