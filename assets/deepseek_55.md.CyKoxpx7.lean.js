This cycle completes in 2-4 weeks.Make a habit to avoid heavy food. Use warm water drinking max possible times. Avoid cold drinks etc. If you can boil holy basil leaves and/or ginger in water and drink daily twice at leat, your symptoms will start easying in 3-4 days or so. If you get vomit once or twice, don't mind.Then use Rumalya tablet 2 nos.  twice a day with warm water for two weeks or more. Continue on getting relief. No side effects on prolonged use even.

Is kidney stone likely the cause of the pain?","Doctor":"Dear Sir,thank you for your consultation.I have gone through your history very carefully.it is good to know that you have no blood pressure problem and urinary problem.I am telling you parents having stone never have any effect on their childre because it is not a familial problem.but certainly the location of pain and the typical feature points finger to some kidney stone,but never confirms it.for confirmation you should go for lower abdomen X-Ray and ultrasonogram.this will clinch the diagnosis if there is any stone at all in your kidney or any place of your urinary system like bladder.so to know for sure you have to undergo these investigations.my best wishes to you.thank you."},{"Patient":"hello,i have ongoing upper back pain on the right side where i was hurt with my playmate s elbow while playing volleyball...it was about a week ago and NOW it hurts...the pain increases when i breathe in. i also feel lightheaded my puls is strangly weak and than races when i start walking...it was ringing in my left ear for a short while, i had a few sudden attacks of pain in my chest during the day,i could not breathe normally and then it stopped, also when i was walking lightheaded my teath were i don t know the word...shivering?shaking like when you re cold but i wasn t cold and my body was shaking too...i feel much better now but the pain in my back won t and my chest slightly hurt everyonce in a while .

Not only to avoid bending and lifting weight but also to avoid sexual activity during this time because it can aggravate the pain.There is no medicine to cure this, exercise can improve the strength of the back muscle  but need to do it with care and supervision.

You did not mention that you had had MRI of the back which gives a lot of information in terms of the vertebra,spinal stenosis and bulging disc. You might have a herniated disc pressing the nerve and giving you this pain. Kidney pain is more in the costal area or the side of the back and will improve after antibiotics. However, you need a kidney ultrasound to evaluate for kidney stone or cysts.Those can get infected and be painful.I hope that my advise has helped you.Dr.Sara"},{"Patient":"my friend has had mid back pain for months. she has had every type of test you can think of and on heavy duty pain meds to no avail.

First, elevated white cell  and UTI means that she has an infection that needs antibiotics. The bleeding polyp is causing the anemia . She needs to make sure that the polyp's biopsy is negative for malignancy, because it is common at her age. Her back pain could be secondary to arthritis,bulging disc vs spinal stenosis. I would recommend her heating pad,physical therapy to improve her back muscles and massage therapy to alleviate the tension in the muscles.I hope that my advise has been helpful .Dr.Sara"},{"Patient":"I am 16 and I have smoked weed nearly 2 years, in the last week Ive been getting intense pressure and popping sounds in the lower back of my head and upper neck.The pressure gets more and more intense as I come off the high.

Core stabilizing spine exercises will help.You may consult physiotherapist for further guidance.

Recently I went to an urgent care due to really bad radiating pain from my low back, to the belt line of my left buttock, and it shot down my leg. They diagnosed me with Degenerative Disc Disease, which was causing sciatica.(L5,S1) (DDD runs on my mother s side of the family, her, her 3 siblings,and her dad. But I do understand that it is something that happens to pretty much everyone over time.) MY LOW BACK HURTS on a daily basis but is getting worse. Urgent care wrote me for methyl-prednisolone, ibuprofen 800, and Norco 5mg, for the sciatica, which helped minimize the pain but I can still feel it. I just looked into the mirror and my right love handle is noticeably bigger than the left. Any clue as to what this is? I also have this weird pain that comes from time to time, usually after eating a majority of the time, where it almost feels like a pressure type of pain (it s like I can feel it gaining pressure or the pain progressing) about 5 inches above my belly button center of my chest, maybe like the sternum area, and i can feel it in my back in the middle but under my shoulder blades.

I must carry on for several years at least as I have a 15 year old Daughter and 17 year old Son who for the time being need me . My problem is that I ve NEVER been one for putting chemicals into my body so I regularly cut down and down until I virtually can t move in the hope of regaining some sort of mobile life , which would make my children extremely happy . I m not naive enough to think that I am immune to depression and I am concerned that I may be on that road . I m a single dad and my life is my children. As foreign as it is to me to be a victim, I am concerned that with the addition of depression, my children s lives could be affected and that is unacceptable. I see a very competent doctor but I don t like a complaining person and feel I may underestimate when conferring with him. I ve contacted this site with the hope that I can keep my dignity and maybe even get a suggestion to help my rapidly escalating fatigue, this is the most debilitating as the pain can be coped with but the fatigue is something will power or longing cannot seem to be controlled. I thank you in advance for anyone who may have time to give a quick sugestion or so Many many thanks Bruce","Doctor":"For severe back pain you can take some pain killer like biozobid-plus or zerodol-mr only when the pain is worse enough or disturb your routine work.

Look for some swelling in lower limbs or any radiating pain to legs. If not, OK.Hot water bath, some spray or light herbal oil massage over back at night will strengthen the lumbar sacral region to overcome fatigue.Additionally, if need be, Rumalya forte Ayurvedic tabs will help a lot.

You should try to lessen the qty of CHEWING tobacco gradually and leave it one day by determination.The neck region and L4-5 pain can best be managed by physio, Yoga, deep breathing and taking simple precautions like not bending too much, avoiding jerks etc.Herbal antiinflammatory and pain managers like guggul and Shigru capsules are best to your needs. These are not pain killers but gradually control pain by antiarthritic effects. 1/2 a spoon of turmeric powder in warm milk or water everyday once or twice additionally will also help. With all these take warm water.I would recommend a very light purgative Tarunikusumakar chooran 1 tsp at night for consecutive three days. Thereafter once a week. Commonly available in india.

The pain is no longer confined to the back area (right side), but i felt like its radiating to the right abdominal area too. The pain can be described as if the muscles are very fatigued. i have not felt any numbness. I find it difficult to find a comfortable sleeping position. I have a moderate lumbar scoliosis, and i noticed that pain started when i started gaining weight..please help.","Doctor":"Dear- thanks for using our system and will give you my medical opinion about your problem. Low back pain is one of the most common causes of visiting the doctor . Most of the time is related to spinal stenosis,arthritis and bulging disc.Overweight aggravates it due to the pressure over the nerve and vertebrae. In addition to this,you have scoliosis that makes it difficult to find a comfortable position. I recommend you to loose weight,start exercise that will improve muscle strength of the back, use an orthopedic or hard mattress and a back support if lifting heavy things. If it doesn't improve, you might need an MRI of lumbosacral for further evaluation of your problem.Dr.Sara"},{"Patient":"my right kidney is .8cm thick while my left is 1.8cm.

I am scheduled for fibroid embolization but my kidney is really painful","Doctor":"Dear- thanks for your question and will give you my medical opinion. The size or thickness of your kidney is not a cause of pain. You can have cysts,stones or any other lesion in the kidney that can be causing that. However,you mentioned that have huge uterine fibroids, those can be painful and may need surgical removal in order to improve that. Sometimes, fibroid embolization helps but you might need surgical removal if no improvement. Your back pain could be related to sciatic too. Kidneys are not typically the main reason for back pain. It is advisable to have urine samples and kidney ultrasound for a complete evaluation of the kidneys.I hope that my advise has been helpfulDr.Sara"},{"Patient":"I have pain in my upper-back in the muscles below the shoulder blades. When I eat or a little over-eat the pain begins and the discomfort subsides with a little massage in the area. I also get mild pain while swallowing food down the food pipe when acidity is high. The pain subsides with use of antacids.","Doctor":"Dear-thanks for using our service, I reviewed your question in detail. Your back pain could be secondary to gas, because it gets worse when you eat or over-eat. It gets better when you massage the area because it helps the movement of the gas.The other situation that aggravates it is the excessive acid reflux, which can irritate the walls of the esophagus and give you pain which can radiates to the back. This pain can be so severe that can mimic a heart attack. Antiacids helps this situation and you can add Ranitidine or Cimetidine, both control the acid production and relieves the reflux.Avoid food like spicy,coffee and alcohol too.All of those changes will improve your symptoms,I hope that my advise has been helpful.Dr.Sara"},{"Patient":"SO i have these horrible cramps in my lower back and I went to use the bathroom and a big clot, between nickle and quarter sized, came off of the tissue..and i was wearing a regular tampon.

You want to make sure that this is not a problem having  your regular pap or cytology test with your doctor.The back cramps are coming from your menstrual period , some women are more prone to others , but is considered normal, unless it is a new problem .

You have been pregnant recently and the weight on your back could aggravated your pain. You should have a MRI of lumbosacral to see what is the level of damage.

And i am ALWAYS exhausted.","Doctor":"Dear-thanks for using our service .I read your question in detail and will give you my medical advise to your complaints. First of all,stomach cramps that moves from the right to the left could be related to gas. You need to review what food you are eating and if some of them produce gas.Examples as lettuce,broccoli,cauliflower,carbonated drinks , can produce it.You might had vomit due to gas or reflux. The headache could be related to indigestion to and back pain could be arthritic but gas can go to the back and give back pain. I recommend you to improve healthy diet and do exercise regularly . That will help the digestion and pain. If you still exhausted, make sure that you don't have anemia or an electrolyte imbalance.I hope that my advise has been helpfulDr.Sara"},{"Patient":"I am taking currently starting to take Percocet.

Thank you. vjp","Doctor":"Dear-thanks for using our service and will give you my medical advise.First of all, the composition of Percocet is narcotic and acetaminophen. The 5mg is the narcotic part and 500mg is acetaminophen. The component that gives you constipation is the narcotic part (5mg) for which an increase in acetaminophen dose will give you risk of liver damage but not constipation. I will advise you to try physical or massage therapy and epidural block if no improvement. It depends of the level of damage that you will improve fast or not. If you have not had MRI of lumbosacral in more than 2 years, it is advisable to have it.Dr.Sara"},{"Patient":"hi , dr prasad . i have  a question for u . i have some black spot on left portion os stomach . it does nt pain or anything . but sometime i feel like somebody just pinch me with a pin ,thts it . is there any thing tht i should be worried abt thnks","Doctor":"HI.Thanks for your query and an elucidate history.The lack spot on the abdomen on the left side with the feeling of pinching with a pin is suggestive of some sort of dermatitis.If this is long standing Melanoma has to be ruled out.

It should be excluded. I think intervertebral disc space in cervical spine is compressed putting pressure on nerves and , may be some vessels too, causing first set of symptoms narrated by  you.If it's so please manage by traction or cervical collar support.Similarly for leg pains if any which is caused by lumbo sacral region. If not affected, other things may be thought of.Heartburn n constipation: have lot of walks, water intake, fibers in food and some safe herbals sometimes  since constipation is the habit of intestines and its not a disease. By above methods, peristaltic movements of intestines will be restored. For heartburn, primarily little qtys of cold milk with a cookie or half slice of bread may be taken frequently. It will neutralise excess acid. If not settled, antacid ( prefer herbal powder like Avipattikar chooran - little bitter) may be tried. If doesn't settle in a week, further checks for oesoophagitis etc may be done. So exclude simple things first. No need to take stress. Life is for limited validity like prepaid sim. Don't panic.

You might have a bulging disc or spinal stenosis, however, it is most likely that is a bulging disc pressing the nerve that is causing this problem.

In term of the knee,Baker cyst sometimes requires surgery to relieve the pain. The numbness of the left knee is from the neuritis and the accumulation of fluid.Thanks for using our serviceDr.Sara"},{"Patient":"My husband has pain in the right side of his back around the hip area, is not the joint, is more where the bone called the ilium ends near the sacrum?

Sclerotic changes consist of inflammation of sacroileac joint of pelvis which turns to fibrosis & finally the bones of the joint unite to form sclerosis of joint.    The fused bones can exert pressure on sciatic nerve,leading to back ache/ sciatic pain.THr pressure on nerve roots at spinal level also can same symptoms.     You are refering to old report.

Some painkillers like ibuprofen and some muscle relaxant like thiocolchicoside for a few days added with local painkiller gel application to avoid systemic side effects of above painkillers. Even after this precautions and medications pain persists, I would have advised the metal implant removal surgery n then an MRI to know the exact pathology inside. U can discuss with your orthopaedic surgeon the above options n get a proper management under his guidance. U should continue neurobion to prevent any further damage to your nerves.

I felt a pain to left of l4 l5 and it shot to straight across to left of my lower back and stopped. it felt like an electrical shock. two days later when I sat down the pain was horrible. I was diagnosed with lumbago and a S1 ligament/joint strain. my mri revealed an asymmetric disc bulge to left at L4-L5 which contacts descending left L5 nerve root in the lateral recess and also results in mid left foraminal narrowing at this level. I have a had two epidurals and one trigger point injection. trigger point injection had kenalog, which hurt like a bee sting and continued to hurt for weeks. this area sometimes still feels like a bee sting. now my back doctor wants to give me facet injections at L4 to S1. pain is really bad to left of L5-S1. pain radiates down to tailbone and both sides of sacrum can hurt. sitting and bending backwards can really hurt. the area can feel like a rug burn. pain from bulging disc no longer goes down left leg. Also I no longer have pain to left of L4, but my doctor wants to put a facet injection in this area. I a very fearful of these injections. I also have mild diffuse degenerative disc disease thoughout the lumbar spine without central canal stenosis and facet arthropathy at L5-S1 resulting in mild bony foraminal narrowing. my back doctor thinks MVA jumpstarted facet pain. could pain be caused by facets?","Doctor":"Hello There ! Its good that there is no radiating pain from the disc bulge. Facet  pain could be one factor , however there could be pain originating from other aspects too in your case like ligaments , due to the mva. If there are no motor and sensory defects , like muscle weakness , numbness  or sensory loss ,my suggestion would be to give a try to conservative pain management remedies. a PHYSIOTHERAPIST has a host of tools to manage your pain and can also assess where it comes from . Kinesiotaping , Ultrasound , TENS etc and gentle manual therapy  as indicated can be applied with excellent results for  pain in low back and sacral areas. Be aware of your postural habits though , some lifestyle changes could be suggested by your physio to help you correct your body mechanics and  manage pain better. tc"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

I am also feeling dizzy and tired all the time. I seem to be able to control the dizzy ness by eating something. Can you tell me if this is all symptoms of pneumonia. At the hospital a ct scan revealed an infection in my right lung.","Doctor":"Dear- Pneumonia is a debilitating disease that can make you feel weak and dizzy while you have it and few weeks later.The pain that you are having is from the inflammation of the lungs or the membrane that covers them which is the pleura. You can have radiation to the pain to upper and lower back,this will start getting better as soon as the pneumonia subsides. The dizziness is from the same infectious process. You need to keep a healthy food intake and adequate water too to avoid more complications.Antibiotics should clear the infection, specially if they were able to isolate the causing agent.I hope my advise has been helpfulDr.Sara"},{"Patient":"I had a laparoscopic hysterectomy on sept 24, 2013 w uterus, cervix, tubes removed.

Your cough could be secondary to bronchitis or sinus infection with post nasal drip that produces cough. The back pain is due to irritation of the area from coughing or it could be irritation of the membrane that covers the lung that get inflamed due to the infection and can gives you pain.

They actually can get away with that in Florida! I have been bounced around so many jobs that it s not even funny! At one job I fell in the rain on one step!

The pain seems to be originating from an irritated nerve in the c8 or T1 area of the spine. There is also a noticeable shift to the right in my vertebrae at the T1/2 spots that can be seen and felt. I have had x-rays and a CT scan but my GP says there is nothing out of the ordinary, even though she was initially shocked by the displacement of my vertebrae from a physical inspection. Lately, symptoms seem to be getting worse with more neck pain, restricted neck movement, referral pain in my left arm, muscle weakness, chronically cold hands, and a moving/crawling sensation near my right temple and eye. I don t know exactly what to do since my GP doesn t seem to be taking my pain very seriously. If you have any advice it would be greatly appreciated.

Your lower lumbar and/ or Coccygial vertebra are exerting pressures on nerves emanating from those regions. Where ever these nerves supply, pain is felt.Pressure could be due to various regions. IVD gaps reduced due to degeneration, trauma etc or osteophytes grown due to age/ ors.Pain killers is no solution. Try physiotherapy and better to do Yoga postures. Warm water treatment over the region while bathing ( pour warm water). Then apply some natural relaxant. To my own patients I successfully recommend Rumalya herbal liniment for very gentle massage. Rumalya forte tab also give strength to muscles and joints. Both are pure non toxic Ayurveda products.Hope it helps you.

I d rather not go on a script if I can help it.","Doctor":"Your case seems to be of inter vertebral disc involvement, thus exerting pressure on nerves emanating out of spinal chord. Due to changes in said region and bending in vertebral column, blood vessels also get compressed somewhere and supply to brain is hampered with all the feelings you mentioned.While lying down, the column is straightened and supply of blood resumes. It may also raise BP temporarily because heart tries forcibly to send blood to brain. This is a natural mechanism.Medicine is not the proper answer.  You should try to do physiotherapy, Yoga postures, deep breathing for ultimate benefit.Constipation is not directly connected.

He sent me to Physical Therapy,this is my third week (no better) my PT says she doesn t know if she can me. I m not sure what to do next.","Doctor":"If there is no trauma or no intervertebral disc space reduction seen which exerts pressure on local nerves, other reason may be osteophytes, sometimes not caught radiologically when in cartilagenous stage.If that also not the reason, there is vitiation of 'Apaan Vayu' - that stays in Coccygial region to lumbar region - going by Ayurveda principles. Basic thing is the same. Theories are explained differently.To my own patients who are sincere to follow, I would recommend Yoga postures to follow those are simple and free of cost. Some deep breathing also helps.Pain killers is no remedy. Rather Ayurveda's Rumalya forte tablets and Rumalya liniment's gentle massage over the region after hot fomentation, have given stable results to many of my patients. These are not pain killers but safe herbal products which strengthen muscles and joints of the area that helps maintain proper gap in IVD spaces and also strengthen nerves. This is holistic approach of Ayurveda. Totally safe. But slow to act because these are not synthesised drugs.So Yoga and herbals are choicest for you if you like to get permanent relief. Some Ayurveda doctor may guide you more on what to eat, what not to eat and other precautions for rapid effect. You may also revert to us through HCM once you decide to start it.Hope it helps you."},{"Patient":"I am having lower back pain when sitting or trying to get up.

My usual painkillers don't seem to help at all now, cocodomal.  Also have tailbone pain, seems to be some debate between doctors as to where this is referred pain or a difficult issue and subsequently is ignored completely.","Doctor":"The only solution which is a basic principle in such lumbo sacral vertebral degeneration/ spondylosis/ arthritis or for that matter whole of the inter vertebral joints is to maintain intervertebral gap. If that gap is reduced by whatever disease or causes as explained above, the nerves originating/ emanating from those sites get compressed. Whole nerve or part thereof - medial or lateral filaments - where ever they supply, pain is bound to take place. Denervation is only removal of feeling of pain and not the real treatment.Surgeons have done their best and may do again.To my own patients I would have suggested to get the support of Ayurveda medicine at some good Ayurveda hospital. There are no pain killers in Ayurveda but cause may be tried to be managed by Panchakarma techniques.May also make use of International Day of Yoga on 21 June where you can learn 35 minute package free if cost.

It s muscular, I m pretty sure, because I can feel it when I massage it. Ibuprofen doesn t seem to do anything for it unlike most of my other minor muscle aches from time to time. Anything I can do?","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM. The pain area which you pointing out is typical for SIJ (Sacro-illiac joint) dysfunction, which means it is not muscular, but related to the SI joint.  The temporary soothing effect of massage is just due to the relaxation of the tight muscles which go into spasm as protective mechanism, due to stiffness of joints.  These simple exercises can relieve your discomfort and pain. 1. Do self stretching Exercises for back, and hamstrings. Step 1. Lie on your back and bend both your knees, lift them up slowly with hands placed under the knees on both sides. Pull towards your head until you feel the stretch in your lower back and let go. Do it for 4-5 times at one go and 3 times a day. Step 2. Hamstrings stretch. Lie Supine, and bend one knee, the other leg has to be straight. Place both your hands under the bent knee, slowly move it up to 90 degree and then keep straightening it upwards until you feel the back of your leg stretched.Repeat thrice at one go, and 3-5 times a day. 2. Do dry icing over the painful area for 10-15 minutes to reduce any inflammation around the area.  3. Lie on your back and bend both your knees , place a pillow between both knees and press it for 5 seconds and let go. Do it for 3-5 times at one go and 3 times in a day. Donts:-1. Avoid bending activities .Hope this information is helpful to you.

I cant seem yo move properly and this strain has had a painful impact on me . Can this be scatica ?","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM. Yes , according to the history you have provided me, the pain radiating to your left leg definitely looks due to sciatica, which is caused by disc protrusion in your lumbar spine. The level at which the disc is protruded can be ruled out by an X-ray or a MRI of lumbar spine. You can do some simple physiotherapy exercises at home like , hamstring stretches and bridging / back lifting exercise to start with, and here are some do's and dont's that will help you avoid pain. Dos :-1. Use lumbar brace while on job. 2. Sit in right posture3. Core strengthening exercises, to get you back on normal pain free activities of daily living.  Donts :- 1. Lift heavy objects.2.

Instead I would advise to my own patients to get the additional support of Ayurveda's pain management oils such as Mahanarayan oil, Mahavishgarbh oil, Mahamash oil or Rumalya liniment of Himalya etc....vast range. Selection of oil by your Ayurveda doctor may be on the basis of condition assessed. Generally the oils are applied  after hot fomentation over back for better absorption.It will support you 100%.

It could be due to many factors such as arthritic conditions developed, any reduction in intervertebral gap because of TB if bones, arthritis, local lesion etc. It all and many others may press the nerves.Since screws are already there and operation of vertebral columns, spinal cord etc is not advisable to be performed again n again, pain killers too have limitations. In such cases, I would firmly tell my own patients to get additional support of Ayurveda's pain management oils such as classic Mahavishgarbh oil, Guduchyadi oil, M.Narayan oil or Patent Rumalya liniment by Himalya herbals to be applied lightly over back after hot fomentation. There may be some oral anti arthritic or pain management medicines. These collectively relax muscles, work as anti inflammatory and nervine tonics. Selection of oils or oral med. will be done by your local Ayurveda physician on the basis of current conditions.Absolutely safe. May be little smelly.

Ibuprofen or Naproxin?","Doctor":"I would not recommend to take either of these with history of stones until or unless you can't move.There are better and harmless options available for managing pain and stones both. Safe, economic, no side effects alternatives in Ayurveda may prevent you from catching side effects of pain killers and dissolving stones and expeliing without surgery ( depends on size and location of stones). The worst may be no response of these herbal medicines.Gokshar guggul, Cystone/ Neeri tablets, Panchakol herbal powder ( five herbs group) decoction prepared at home and Rumalya and / or Mahanarayan oil have the qualities needed for your treatment .

It is due to irritation of nerves caused by prolapsed lumbar disk. Accoding to my valued peer Dr,narender saini sir's suggestion-Herniation of disc has various magnitude, if its a small herniation than that will not put any pressure on the root or cord, and thus will not be symptomatic, this is usually present in many of us, but if the herniation increases and start compressing the cord, backache develops, and if it compresses the root, radiating pain in the leg develops. Your pain if does not goes away with acetaminophan hydrocodone you need higher pain meds under doctor guidance  like naproxen, opiod analgesia and so on. Also to confirm diagnosis a MRI is needed if not yet done. You need to take rest for sometime time and lie in position that gives you least pain. after 3 weeks you can consult a physiotherapist to begin some physical exercise to strenghten your back muscles.I hope this helpsWish you all the best.Thank you for using healthcare magic."},{"Patient":"I have RSD and some back problems.

The report from the hospital said no appendicitis but extrarenal pelvis on rt. I have been seen by a urologist who said my right kidney is shaped differently from the left, and they have known for a long time that my right kidney is slow drainingk. Prior to this visit, I was seen in another ER where they did a renal aorta/retro scan on me and said there was a back-up in the right kidney, thus sending me to a urologist. A temporary stent was put in and removed a week later with no appreciable reduction in pain. I have had repeated bladder infections, all of them resulting in blood in the urine. I have had a nuclear test on the kidneys, cystoscopy (interstitial cystitis), abdominal and pelvic MRI, abdominal and plelvic CT Scan w/o contrast (looking for a stone), 3 stool cultures and 5 blood tests. The last stop is a colonoscopy with a gastroenterologist. The report from the first ER was sent out of the hospital to be read since the radiologists all leave at 8:00 p.m. I received a copy and CD of the test. In it they state that there are no abnormalities of the gallbladder. My gallbladder was removed in June of 2011. This makes me wonder if we don t need a more qualified radiologist to read this test.

I can manage quite well, put up with a lot of chronic pain that varies from a 6-10 (10 being must take Advil and go to bed). I could probably just keep on living this way, but what really gets me down is that I have found it next to impossible to exercise consistently and regularly. Even Pilates!! Walking, cycling, yoga, pilates, Barr, ligth weight training, all cause flare ups to the point I end up having to completely stop exercising and get on NSAIDS (that don t really help). Basically I have less pain when I not active, once I get active I am experience a lot of soreness, pain which also interferes with my sleep. All this means I am not very active just to manage my chronic pain. So... I see a surgeon tomorrow... what are the top 5 questions I should ask him?? Thank you for your help.

Get a Doctor's opinion, physical examination of vitals to see that you do not have Hypertension, Blood reports to see that you do not have Thyrotoxicosis and other medical problems, CT scan brain for headaches and other tests as may be advised by your Doctor.

They come and go, the discomfort is a dull irritated feeling around my urethra as well as an ache to the left side of my vulva. It's quite a hard feeling to explain.

Please also note that I look tired all the time even if I get sleep [pronounced dark circles].  Everyone always tells me I look like crap even if I feel ok at that moment [i.e. the pain is dull or at a tolerable level -mild discomfort is the best it gets]. I have had the following images taken: 1) CT 2) ultrasound.  I have had blood work and urine work done more than once.  The images show two kidney stones in right side.  But, the urologist is CERTAIN that the stones are NOT causing my pain, but he does not know why I have this pain, the source of this pain or how I got this pain.  The urologist referred me to the Gastro doctor - we did blood work and urine - ultrasound - took the RX Prilosec ---reviewed the CT -- Gastro says everything [all anatomy depicted in the full abdominal ultrasound] is fine and that he does NOT know why I have this pain - Gastro says next step is to look inside stomach or do a endoscopy on both ends but that he says highly highly unlikely that the endo will shed any light on this right side abdominal pain that is definitely NOT muscular or tied to my obliques.    So, here I am, still with this pain and left without answers.  I am going for yet another opinion and peak next week at a Cedars Sinai Gastro.  Please, any ideas what this pain is due to and why I have it, what it is etc? Also, what should I do at this point.

Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.As you have not mentioned anything about the size of the stones in kidney, it might not be possible to opine if they were the culprits for your pain or not. Other investigations being normal, if I were your doctor, I would advise you to stop eating from out side if you do, as many components of food from outside, specially the fast food might contain some ingredients to which your intestines might be more sensitive and give rise to such symptoms. I would advise you to add more of roughage and enough liquids in your diet,and to avoid any alcoholic beverages and smoking if you do. In addition, I would advise you to go for a routine test of your stool for ova and cyst, which when treated surprisingly cure many of the chronic abdominal pain. I am sure your clinician must have examined your abdomen clinically to rule out chances of any recurrent appendicitis. Also I would go for a routine/microscopic and culture sensitivity test for urine to rule out a silent UTI which is not uncommon. In case of female patients, a PID (pelvic inflammatory disease have to be ruled out) by a gynaecologist. Till then, you could go for some anti spasmodic drug and a proton pump inhibitor and a probiotic drug for a symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I ve put this off for a long as I can, but getting around this pain is getting really old. My question is; do I have reasonable chance to get some long term relief? I m in reasonably good health but I do smoke a pack a day. Thanks for your consideration.","Doctor":"Hi,From your information it seems you have a condition where there is a nerve compression for a prolapsed disc or a stenosis (narrowing of the canal caused by either the disc or extra bone formations or even a shift in the vertebral position).All these causes a bad back but essentially leads to pains shooting down the limb and disturbances in sensation.So to answer your question, if the MRI does show a nerve affection or an unstable vertebral bone and it correlates with your symptoms and signs,then there is a good chance that you will get pain relief.However this is along standing condition and your back muscles will be weak and contracted which means  intensive physiotherapy will be required.Furthermore you are a moderately heavy smoker and this will in no way help pain relief or a quick recovery so think about quitting!"},{"Patient":"When I yawn, my legs tingling nearly to pain or collapsing.

It shootsthrough my back, down my right buttock and into the top of my thigh. It just seems to be getting worse and it s affecting my job. I am currently on co-codomol tablets for pain from endometriosis and PCOS. I was wondering if they are related or if there may be a different problem?","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to Health Care Magic.Thanks for writing.I am Dr.Saddiq-ul-Abidin. I have read your question completely, I understand your concern and will try to help you in best way possible.I am sorry to know about the problem you have been facing, Your pain does not seem to be related to endometriosis or PCOS, it is quite a characteristic pain which happens in nerve impingement due to muscle spasm or spine issues.That's why when there is pressure on the nerve while you sit , the pain shoots down along the nerve pathway all to way to your thigh.There are certain measures which you can take for it  some will benefit in short term and some will benefit in long term.1) Take Rest and avoiding sitting when you can.2) Warm compresses, warm water bottle under this area will help to relieve muscle spasm  and will loosen up inflamed tissues.3) Rubbing voltral gel over the area can be helpful.4) You may be suffering from low bone density because of low calcium and vitamin D due to your hormonal imbalances I will suggest you to take Vitamin D and calcium supplements 1 tab daily.5) You can take Centrum for women daily one tablet.I would also suggest similar patients in my clinic to take muscle relaxant like Movax 4mg twice a day this really helps. You are already taking a heavy pain killer so I would not suggest you to increase the dose.I this doesn't settle in a week or so, Get a check-up by Neuro-spinal surgeon he might want to get your X-ray lumber spine done, or you MRI spine, this will make causes and treatment options clearer to you and your doctor. Hopefully things will settle down soon.I hope this answered your question.If you have more queries I am happy to answer.Otherwise rate and close the discussionRegrads.Dr.Saddiq ul AbidinM.B.B.S(Licensed Family Physician)Resident Medicine."},{"Patient":"I am 50 years old and had emergency herniated disc operation 6 weeks ago ( went through my neck) ever since I have had stomach bloating, feeling full all the time, abdominal discomfort above my belly button and short of breath.

I am active, exercising 3 to 4 times a week and eat a healthy diet. I was hospitalized in July for 5 days with an infectious colitis I brought back from Mexico. I believe the bacteria was Clostridium Jejunum. I was on metronidazole and cipro in the hospital. I also had pylonephritis about 4 years ago in my right kidney for which I was also hospitalized for 5 days. Since my recent hospitalization in July of 2012 I have had right back/flank pain. The pain started when I was in the hospital and hasn t let up. It is progressively getting worse. I asked my doctor in the hospital how my kidney function was and she said rock solid so I was convinced it would go away. Finally, 3 months later I made an appointment because it wasn t getting any better. The cytology report came back as follows: Clinical Information and/or Impression: A) 40Ml Cloudy yellow fluid Specimen is received unfixed and labeled with the patient s name. ____________________________________________________________________________ DIAGNOSIS: A) Urine (ThinPrep preparation): Benign urothelial and squamous cells. No evidence of malignancy identified. They also did a creatine level which came back 0.9. I have no other levels so it is really hard to tell if it is trending up or not, but I think I remember asking in the hospital in July and it was 0.8 (not positive though). There was also trace amounts of blood in my urine. She sent me for a CT that came back normal for my kidneys and bladder. No stones or anything they could see. However, she did say there was an ovarian cyst on the right side 3.9cm by 2.5cm. She wants to watch this and does not seem concerned about my kidney. Could this be causing my back pain and the blood/cells in my urine? Should I see a urologist for my flank pain or continue taking IBU to help the pain?","Doctor":"Hi, I did review your concern. Generally ovarian cysts cause back pain but usually do not cause blood in urine. Hence, i would advice you to go see a urologist. I would recommend not to take ibuprofen, since long term ibuprofen can itself damage your kidneys and cause analgesic nephropathy. if you have fever, night sweats or other problems it could be infection. another cause could be something in the kidney causing hematuria. so consult a urologist and see how it goes from there. better be earlier than late in cases of kidney.i hope this helpswish you a superhealthy life ahead."},{"Patient":"for last 4 months I have had bad back pain which has now spread into my legs I also have a lot of pain around the pubic bone area.

October 2009 I found out I had a nodule located on my thyroid which a biopsy proved inconclusive to being malignant or benign. So my doctors decided to do a surgery removing only the left side of my thyroid due to the location of the nodule. Results from that surgery proved to be malignant hurthle cell carcinoma. 4 months after that surgery I underwent a total thyroidectomy and also had 7 lymph nodes removed due to calcification. For a few months following that I lost my voice randomly and developed nodules on my vocal cords from what they said was the endotrachael tube and had to see a speech therapist. I also had a calcium drop from 10.1 (pre-surgery) to 8.4(post-surgery) consistently. 6 months after my second surgery I took the radioactive iodine and then did the body scan. Although the doctors said it turned out good I was told there was supposed to be 0 traces of iodine in my system with the exception of my thyroid. I did the scan 4 days after swallowing the iodine and the scan showed it in my bladder and kidneys. is this due to just being excreted? And if so is that normal for 4 days after the scan? Also I did a thyroglobulin test that i was told was supposed to be 0 and it was .6, could this be significant? All that was specifially to ask this, A few months after the treatment I started developing lower back pain, when I saw my endocrinologist I informed him of it but since I was having a hard time adjusting to the proper dosage of snythroid(for a 3 month period I was hypothyroid) he convinced me I was just achy and having body pains due to being hypo. For 4 months now I have been pretty much within normal ranges on my TSH and FT4 but my back pain won t go away. Even just standing for 20 minutes or more causes horrible pain if I have to bend over or sit down or move positions. It almost takes me breathe away. Could this be my calcium change? Or possible cancer in the bone? Or is it possible for your vertebreas to fuse together? HELP ME","Doctor":"As mentioned in your narrative you have got rid with just a muscle spasm nothing else. For this you have to take some pain killer with muscle relaxant like tab dan-mr or tab osteonac-th after meals when your back pain is worse enough to disturb your routine work along with tab shalcal 500 mg once daily preferably in afternoon with tab rantac or tab famotid empty stomach. You can also use volidup gel or powergesic-plus gel for local application as it is quite helpful in relieving your back pain and muscle spasm.

Core stabilizing spine exercises will help.You may consult physiotherapist for further guidance. He may start TENS, or ultrasound which is helpful in your case.I will advise to check your vit B12 and vit D3 level.If MRI shows disc compressing on nerve root then surgical decompression is permanent solution.Hope this answers your query.

Started with tingling in 2 middle toes on my left foot. Then severe deep pain on the left lower section of my back with extreme skin sensitivity like a sunburn. After that a small rash on my lower left hip on the side that turned into blisters...slightly varied in size & somewhat running in lines but not quite...like 2 or 3 together in a line. The rash is extremely painful, not itchy and I am so sensitive there and elsewhere that I can t stand clothing touching me. I live in Ontario, Canada, and proceeding this rash I spent two days pulling river rocks out of a lawn and a wheel-barrow full of rocks fell over hitting me in the lower leg and possibly in the back, plus I was whiplashed in a car accident years ago...so the back pain could be related to both the rash and prior or recent injuries. There is a small black dot in the middle of the rash...could be a tiny freckle or an insect bit but I would think that a rash from a tick bit would be itchy and this one is not. I m 56 years old and considered myself in good health prior to this. Also feel exhausted, pain keeps me up at night and the first day of the rash I felt light headed but have not felt particularly feverish. I have no idea whether I had chicken pox as a child but if I did then I would guess I may have shingles. I would appreciate your ideas on what this may be.

Virus of chicken pox remains dormant in ganglia of peripheral nerves, if body's immunity is lowered or in times of stress it gets reactivated and presents as Herpes Zoster, rashes and lesions follow a dermatomal distribution and are very painful.

Especially right elbow pain, feeling some lump little above the neck on right side, if I press there, it is paining till right hand.  Recently started paining from right side buttok (sometime pelvic) to leg.  Sometime severe, sometime mild.  Fatigue, giddiness also there.  I am suffering with migraine and hypothyroidism since years.  Pl. suggest!!","Doctor":"Here you have ask treatment for back pain but in your explanation you have given symptom of neck pain radiating to arm and hand, back pain, as well Migrain and headache along with painful lump on your neck.As per the symptoms there could be multiple possibilities or problems with you.Neck pain radiating to arm and hand could be related to cervical spine issue along with lump at cervical spine.Pain in back to buttock could be related to lumbar level spinal issue along with sciatic nerve disturbamce.Headache and Migrain could be related to deficiency of minerals vitamins and protein in body or too much of physical or mental stress.How ever to conform the diagnosis you have to visit a ortho and neuro doctor and here they will check with physical tests as well may ask for MRI scan of spine and brain if needed. Now here ortho will guide yo for treatment based on severity of problem. If there is mild to moderate spinal problem then it can be treated with few medication along with physiotherapy treatment. If there is any thing major then ortho may ask for surgical correction. For lump over your neck also if it is painful and increasing in size then need to go for surgical excision along with biopsy.I also suggest to take a postural correction advice as well spinal exercise advise from physio to follow it regularly in future for prevention of further issues.For Migrain and headache treatment will be guided by your neuro physician based on physical examination and MRI report.

It can be due to soft tissue weakness or inflammation, it can be related to spinal issue or disc problem, it can be due to nerve compression at back. In your explanation you have also inform that now it's becoming better. So if its becoming better I suggest no need of any sarapin shot. As well I suggest to use hot and cold pack alternately for relaxing your soft tissues further. Here I suggest also take advice on postural correction and spinal exercises and do follow it for prevention of back pain in future.In case if you still get pain then understand one thing pain is protective mechanism of our body. When pain comes its alarm there is some thing wrong. So I suggest instead of treating pain as a symptom do find out the cause of pain and treat the cause first and then the symptom.Your problem does not look major as per your explanation so will get over soon. But any time if it becomes more then visit ortho or physio doctor to know the cause of pain and take treatment according to it.

Around that time, I also kind of felt this feeling like there was something in my penis, as when I am desperately holding back urine, trying not to pee, But when I tried to pee, only little dribbles would come out. I sort of assumed that this was some kind of constipation problem, because I was trying to move my bowels too, without that much success, even though I had eaten a fair amount yesterday. But it didn't quite feel like constipation. As these last eight hours progressed, the pain in my lower back became increasingly intense (although it went away at times, particularly when  I was lying on my back or on my left side, or when I had walked around a little). At some point I got the idea that it was a kidney stone, so I started drinking water. I also took ibuprofen, and, about, two hours ago, Nyquil (I was thinking it might knock me out and make me sleep through this whole terrifying ordeal). I was trying to use the bathroom every five or ten minutes, but nothing was happening, other than some dribbles, and a few little bits of fecal matter, and some farting...but nothing really substantial. About an hour ago, I noticed that the pain had substantially decreased. I went to pee and a good healthy stream came out. My questions are as follows: i) how likely was it that what I had / have was a kidney stone?; ii) what should I do in terms of following up on this?; iii) how likely is it -- given that I still feel a kind of dull ache in that place in my back (but much less, and of a different kind, than before) -- that I am at least temporarily done with this ailment, whatever it was?","Doctor":"Hey..I'm pretty much sure that this isn't a case of kidney stone. But is surely a case of constipation....due to the increased abdominal pressure required to pass stools you get lower back ache. I advise you to take a laxative and consume high fibre food. Laxative to be taken- Macrogol granules --2 teaspoon in a glass of water at night. For lower back ache --Zerodol P tablet twice a day after food for 5  days and tablet Esogard twice a day before food for 5 days."},{"Patient":"I am a 29 year old female, 5 9, 142lbs. I had spinal fusion surgery december 2010 with instrumentation from T4 to L4. I have had increasing back pain since late July which has gotten progressively worse in August. For the past 3-4 weeks I had noticed in an increase in needing to urinate but I just thought I was drinking more. I also was having stomach pain/cramping and a lot of back pain but I attributed the stomach pain to IBS and the back pain to just worse back pain since I ve had surgery. Since this past week my back is swollen in spots. Friday night pain got worse, I had chills and muscle spasms. Then by Monday my entire spine felt like it was on fire with a lot of pain and stiffness particulary in my mid-upper back and neck. I went to see my general pracitioner Monday this week who found bacteria, white blood cells, nitrites and blood in my urine. She prescribed sulfameth trimethoprim to take with aleve. I have been on this since Monday. The burning sensation along my spine has decreased however there is alot of pressure in my back...just feels huge. I am having more pain in the mid-lower left side and there is swelling there and am very fatigued. I may have had a slight fever if any but my regular body temps always 96-97. Yesterday I developed more abdominal pain that wasn t there before and I am still having muscle spasms. My question is whether or not I need to seek additional medical treatment or if this is a normal response to antibiotic treatment and just wait it out . I have called my surgeons office and dr office but still haven t been called back and I don t know what to do. I am fearing a kidney infection and of course I m very concerned about any infection settling in my hardware along my spine. How do they check for a kidney and or spinal infection? Can you please recommend a course of action. I really don t want to go to an ER because I always feel like that s for trauma stuff but I don t know what other options I have at the moment. Please give me some guidance. Thank you.","Doctor":"As you have mentioned in your history it is clear that you are suffering from disc prolapse.

I suggest you to take pain killer not on regular basis but only when your back pain is unbearable or disturbing your routine activities.You can also use volidup gel or powergesic-plus gel for local application. It is also very beneficial in relieving the back pain and provide you some comfort. Apart from these you can also go for some physiotherapy exercises after an expert opinion of physiotherapist.

If there is major problem at spinal level then it will be surgical correction and if there is mild to moderate issue it will be treated with physiotherapy exercises and treatment along with some medication as per your body need like calcium, vitamin d , muscle relaxants etc.You can also use hot pack for some more relief in pain.For your abdominal pain I suggest if it is first time it may be gastritis also so change your food habits. Do not take oily and spicy food. Maintain food timing. Keep water intake of 3-4 liter per day. And do walking regularly in night before you go to sleep. Have one anta acid pill daily morning with empty stomach for 15days  and see how you feel. If it goes in 2 to 3 days well and good or else you need to visit a physician and may need to do ultrasound abdomen to rule out other possibility. Later can plan treatment as per the ultrasound report.Possibility are many with abdominal pain like gastritis, gastric ulcer, kidney stone since it is also associated with back pain, gallbladder stone, liver issues etc. How ever the conformation can be done only with ultrasound and proper physical examination only.Take care"},{"Patient":"i am a male 40 yrs old.i have been having a mild back ache on the upper back.it is at times on the left and at times on the right.i at times also have a mild ache on the chest.it comes and goes.certain days there could be no pain at all.when it is hot, there is no pain.i am having hypo thyroid and taking 50mg eltroxin.","Doctor":"Hypothyroid patient use to have side effects like fatigue, weakness and pain in muscles, stiffness in muscles, increase body weight due to water retention, and increased heart rate etc Here you have explain you have mild back pain which is radiating to the chest. There could be few possible causes for this. 1. It may be because of muscle weakness and stiffness in back muscle as a side effect of hypothyroidism or mechanical back pain too.2. Chest pain could be because of increase water retention in body and increase heart rate putting more pressure on heart.Here for both above cases I suggest to do thyroid test and if its not in control do proper treatment.Even after that if you have mild back pain I suggest to get examine your back with physio or ortho and take treatment. As well follow postural correction and spinal exercises as per physiotherapist guideline.For chest pain check if it is increasing walking up hill or while exerting yourself with breathing difficulty. If it is increasing then do ECG and tredmill test and based on result consult a cardiologist for proper examination and evaluation.

I have had a slight pain in my lower back but much more pain in both legs, like they are being squeezed very hard ever since.  What can this be?","Doctor":"Pain in back and pain in leg this could be related to each other or it could be separate issues also. You can check one thing lying position on your back legs straight. Now when you lift your leg up straight ( any one leg ) then how is your pain in leg and back. If you say pain is more in back and at the same time in leg also then it can be associated to each other and you have problem at limbosacral spinal level. Now if there is pain only at back and there is no pain in leg follow the another test. Long sitting position that is sitting only but keeping your leg straight ask some one to hold your calf muscle bulk and squeeze it or press it hard and check do you have pain in leg. If you say yes then it can be due to problem with blood circulation in legs.How ever the conformation can be done by only specialist like ortho or physio and you may need to under go for MRI of back as well dopler study for legs if needed.And based on result of physical examination and MRI ortho doctor for mild to moderate issue will suggest to take physiotherapy treatment and exercises along with medication. For major damage at spinal level he will suggest for needed surgical correction.Now if there is circulation problem in lower limb here doctor may ask you to visit a vascular  surgeon or some medications again for it.Doing exercises suggested by physio for back pain radiating to legs along with use of hot and cold pack at back also gives good relief.Take care."},{"Patient":"I have intense pain in my back above the waist on the right side.

I then started having back pain on both side of my lower and upper back so severe I find it hard to breath, and it wakes me up at night, but goes away after a short time and then comes back. Then yesterday, I started having really horrible tailbone pain and found it hard to sit or stand or lay down. I feel the urge to go to the bathroom and I have no luck getting anything out and it hurts my back like crazy to try. I looked at my bottom in a mirror and it doesn't look like a hemorrhoid, it looks more like skin grew over my anus and now there is no view of a hole anymore and there is a red streak that started out small this morning and now it has spread up to my spine from the aaus and I feel excruciating pain when I sit, stand, lay or even try to go to the bathroom in my spine and hips.

I have fibromyalgia, IBS, Interstitial cystitis, Migraines, and Bipolar as my history. I have been taking Neurontin and elavil though for those things.","Doctor":"Here you have told as per your past and current history you have irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, migtain, and fibromylgia. Now recently you have started developing back pain along with muscle spasm feeling in your leg.Here your back pain can be related with multiple issues. It can be due to fibromylgia where it is affecting your spinal muscles, it can be due to IBS where due to overstrain on soft tissue it is causing pain, it can be due to problem at lumbosacral spinal level where there might be issue at lumbar spinal curve or disc related problems disturbing the nerves coming from.that perticular level, it can also be due to interstitial cystitis which is disturbing the soft tissue and creating more inflamation in soft tissue.How ever the conformation can be done by MRI of lumbosacral spine and physical test examination by orthopedic doctor. As per the report and orthopedic examination, ortho doctor will suggest you either surgical correction for severe damage in spine and disc or  conservatibe management with physiotherapy treatment and exercises for mild to moderate issues.Here if you have any issue with your digestive system as well for passing motion then you can also check once with gastro entrologist.For back pain you can also use hot and cold pack to have some more relief at home it self.As well do take suggestion on postural correction and physiotherapy spinal exercises properly. This will help to improve strength and stamina of your spine.If your MRI is normal and it gets conform that back pain is due to fibromylgia. I suggest first keep some rest to body and mind, do pranayama and yoga to heal body from inside. Along with this again physiotherapy treatment and suggestion will help you a lot.Also do changes in your life style like keep food habit regular and have simple food with Lora of fruits and fibre, maintain sleeping time etc.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hey, I'm 14 and my back is killing me when I move, breathe or move my shoulders. the pain is just below the middle of my shoulder blades, and it feels like someone is repeatingly stabbing me.

You have also inform that you are not over weight. Then I would like to know for what resion you are taking oxylite pro. Because it helps to improve metabolism in body but along with that it also have side effects of constipation, muscle twitching, restlessness, heart attack etc. So this can also cause back pain issue.I suggest if possible you should avoid this oxylite pro and to improve metabolism you can take vitamine b rich diet and do exercise like running and cycling as well paying on ground as much as you can. Next is I suggest to check with physio and if you have only muscular pain at back due to spinal muscle weakness then do regular back exercises as well initially you can also take some physiotherapy treatment for relaxing your soft tissues at spinal level. Later doing spinal exercises will help you for improving strength and stamina of your spine. Here I also suggest to take suggestion on postural correction from physio.If you have pain from your back to your legs along with numbness and tingling sensation then you need to get MRI of your lumbosacral spine and need to check the issues related with disc and nerve.

For supper I ate barbeque and started experiencing stomach pain and back pain along with feeling my heartbeat in my stomach. What could cause that???","Doctor":"Oxyelite pro is mainly use to burn fat faster by increasing metabolism and so that it helps to reduce weight. However it is also having some side effects like muscle twitching, increased heart rate, constipation, decrease appetite, restlessness etc.Here you have complain you had increase heart rate. As well pain in back. It could be related to the consumption of oxyelite pro also. Oxyelite Pro is a vasoconstrictor, which shrinks the diameter of blood vessels and impedes blood flow. With an increased heart rate, vasoconstriction can increase blood pressure, which can increase one's risk for a heart attack or stroke. When used with exercise, this can be potentially dangerous.Hot Flashes:  Some users of Oxyelite Pro have reported hot flashes. This is from the increase in thermogenic compounds which can increase the metabolism. The side effect of increased metabolism is sudden hot flashes. From all above data it looks like you had stomach pain due to constipation or hot flashes as well back pain could be due to muscle twitching and increased heart rate is already a side effect of oxyelite pro.Here I suggest to stop having it and follow a natural way of reducing weight like doing regular exercises as well maintaining healthy balance diet. This will be much better for your physical health too.In case after stopping this oxyelite pro still you have the same symptoms then I suggest to visit a doctor for detail examination of your heartand stomach health along with back issues.Take care."},{"Patient":"hi Making this query for my father, who is 58 yrs his HB count shows 19.

But I need to know what about other parameters like is he having sugar ( diabetes)?Well if he is not diabetic then next is what about hypertension, cholesterol or any other medical history.?If he is healthy and this is first time some thing happening  different then I suggest to check on his back pain. Is it coming from back to leg along with numbness and tingling sensation. If yes then his problem is at spinal level which is affecting the nerve coming from that particular level and so that he has pain and sensory changes at lower end of the leg where ever the nerve supplies.But if there is no symptoms of radiating pain then it could be some thing related to vascularity where his lower limb circulation might be affected. Now to have conformation on this there is physical test that is hold and squeeze his calf muscle and check about pain if he complain of pain then the test is positive showing abnormality in circulation for lower limb. How ever the conformation can be done only after dopler test for lower limb.Here just with symptoms of redness in finger tip, fatigue, pain is not enough for any diagnosis it can also be related to simple fever where you will have similar symptoms. soni suggest to take him to doctor in case the symptoms are not going on its own and get him examine properly and do needful.Take care."},{"Patient":"what is the half life of Klor-Con?

In your case it may be spinal muscle which are week and so that patient is having back pain. Along with this pain if patient also have disc related issue at lumbar spine then he will also have symptoms at thigh level with radiating pain or increased sensitivity in thigh muscles.  Here I suggest you nothing to worry just finish your antibiotic medication course for uti and then check, most probably all symptoms will go away and later you should do spinal strengthening exercises. But if still back pain and increased sensitivity at thigh level continue then consult orthopedic and take mri of your back to rule out issues with lumbar level.

But your explanation is not clear which medication it is and for what it is, as well you have not inform about your previous medical history so specific guidline is not possible but can suggest in general as bellow.First you consult a doctor and do your blood test for complete blood count, vitamin b, calcium check. Then also go for ECG. Now based on report if any thing gets detected follow treatment. If all reports are normal then you need to visit a gastro  entrologist because it can be related to gastritis.

If the soreness comes back then you need to visit again either orthopedic to check the spinal issues or else you need to visit dermatologist for examination of your affected area skin.

I have been told that I now have PHN and have recently suffered a flare up of shingles.I am absolutely at the end of my tether, painkillers don't work and just about get through each day at work, but am emotionally and physically exhausted the rest of the time.  This effects all parts of my life and my husband and I have slept with a pillow between us for a year now - I can't bear the thought of that area being touched.  Sometime the pain is most severe just under my back shoulder and on a scale of 1 - 10, it is a 10!  I sometimes think that I can't go on.","Doctor":"HIWell come to HCMAbdominal pain that you are having could be nonspecific if all the test turned unremarkable, some time emotional stress could be the reason for this, if I would be your treating physician then I would treat this case with the following medicines, if this fails to responds then this can be further investigated and MRI Gastroscopy would be advisable,1) Tab Clinidium with Chlordiazepoxide three times in day take care and have a nice day."},{"Patient":"Hi, I had my tubes cut and burned and tide almos two years ago after a c-sec. Last month I had my reg period. This month I am about 2 weeks late. Lower abdomen pain and sometimes back pain that comes and goes. I am very regular and if I have abdomen pain my period usually follows right after. But this time I am still waiting for it and nothing! Could I be pregnant?","Doctor":"Dear patient With your both tubes ligated and cut  There is very rare chance of you getting pregnant.  But cases have been reported of pregnancy  after tubal ligation. Also your periods are very regular till date and this is first time they are late. So possibility  of pregnancy  should be considered.  I would advise 1. Urine pregnancy test  2. Ultrasound  of abdomen and pelvis.  Both are sensitive  In diagnosis of pregnancy and ultrasound  also rules out other uterine conditions.  So get this done.  You should visit expert gynecologist with report."},{"Patient":"I suffer from stenosis of the lumber region. Neurosurgeon says nothing sinister there and prescribed Dicloflex 75 mg. I find them good. Is it ok to take these tablets continuously. Since last Feb. 2014 have just used 2 months of prescription. Mary","Doctor":"Dear patient Lumbar canal stenosis has good results with conservative  management. It depends on severity of stenosis. If lumbar canal is stenosis is more than 50 % surgery is must. If stenosis is less than 60% conservative management  has good results. Dicloflex  can be taken but has side effects on long duration  that includes 1.  Gastritis with ulcer and if not treated  may  lead to perforation 2. Kidney damage with  fibrosis 3. Mouth ulcers . So long term use is not advised . Ask for better alternative  and go for physiotherapy.  Epidural steroid injection has also better effects on symptoms  and is opd procedure without any significant side effects.

Prolapse leads to stretch pelvic floor muscles and intestines with it and hence pain occurs. This typically happens on standing and mobilization as with gravity pelvic organs prolapse occurs and you get pain. But when you rest in supine position  pelvic  organs go into their place and  prolapse is reduced by itself which relieves you of stretch and pain. You need to visit expert gynecologist  and ask for treatment  of uterine prolapse.  You may either opt for hysterectomy with pelvic floor repair if your family is complete or asks for sling surgery  and pelvic floor repair if you want to preserve uterus.  All the best."},{"Patient":"im an 18 year old girl that has been having this weird pressure in her lower back which makes it difficult to sit for long periods of time. this has been happening for a week now together with nausea, thirst, fullness in the lower abdomen, diarrhea, and fatigue....im not sure if this could be because of stress or because i might be pregnant but the possibility might be very slim since last time i was active we could not do anything since it was painful and he came but with a condom","Doctor":"If you had sex with condom then its not possible that you get pregnant. As well if you have got period after that then its conform that you are not pregnant. Here you need to check your back pain started after abdominal problem or before it. If back pain started before abdominal issue then back pain could be different and abdominal pain could be different.How ever the conformation will.be done by physical examination and few tests. so I suggest you to visit specialist and get your self examine, here for back pain if it is from long time with radiating pain to legs doctor will ask you for MRI of back. As well for abdominal discomfort, heavy ness and nausea you need to do ultrasound abdomen.Based on report you can discuss it with your specialist and plan for treatment. In general here still till the time diagnosis is not conform I suggest to improve your food habits by having good amount of water and fruits in your diet, avoid spicy food. At the same time for your back use hot pack to relax the soft tissue. This will also give you some more relief.As per your explanation looks like you have got disturb gastro intestinal system and due to that you have diarrhea and due to that more pressure on back muscles there is heavyness feeling too.How ever the conformation will be only by physical examination and needed tests.Take care"},{"Patient":"My 73 year old father had a direct laryngoscopy on 8-1-2014. Afterwards in recovery he complained of burning pain in his back and there was a red square on his skin where he said it hurt. on 8-10-2014 we took him to the ER with pain in his back and side and they said he had pneumonia. During the next few weeks after several more trips to the ER and two to his Family Physician and two stays in the hospital treating pneumonia, all with constant back and side pain on 9-6-2014 an xray of his chest to look for pneumonia (again) exposed a T6 and T7 compression fracture of the spine that was acute. Is there something in this procedure that caused this fracture? He walked into the procedure and lived independently at home before the procedure with no complaints of pain. he does have osteoporosis which this ENT knew of before the procedure. He had a clear chest xray and was released by his family doctor for the procedure on 7-18-2014. From 8-1-2014 to 9-6-2014 he progressively worsened with pain to the point of walking leaned over at a 90 degree angle and now he cannot walk and will be in long term care. Did this procedure cause his fractures?","Doctor":"Laryngoscopy is a procedure done by specialist till your neck level or upper respiratory level to view the larynx and surrounding area for problems like voice change, hoarseness of voice, dyspnea, irritative cough etc. It can not affect back spine in a practical way. There is possibility that his spine was extremely weak due to osteoporosis and due to some improper posture while doing the procedure spine came under pressure and he started having the problem.Burning sensation and pain in back shows damage to either soft tissue near the spine or damage to spinal nerve or disc at that level. How ever the conformation can be done by MRI of affected spinal level. Based in result here you have to take opinion from spinal surgeon or orthopedic doctor on further treatment planning. Boost the patient with calcium and vitamin D as directed by doctor. In severely damage spine here doctor may ask for surgical correction also. In that case you can also take secondary opinion and go ahead with needed treatment. After this consult a physiotherapist for rehabilitation part and also take suggestion in posrtuee as well spinal exercises which will help the patient further to improve strength and stamina of spine.You can also use hot pack at home for some more relief and soothing effect on soft tissues.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi I am a 35 year old, post-op transsexual, who prior to surgery was diagnosed with Kyphosis aftre an accident in which I had a unstable burst T12 fracture.

However since the gender re-assignment surgery, the pain has gotten worst and I have found myself virtually housebound, as my mobility is severly restricted by the pain.The pain altrenates depending on what posture I adopt, while sitting it is in my upper back and lower legs, while standing it is in my upper & lower legs, and pelvic and lumbar region of my back. I am currently being treated with pain relief alone, MST tablets 20mg BD, and Oramorph 10ml 4 times a day, Arcoxia anti-inflammatory, amitryptyline for nerve pain, and paracetemol.

For this as you have told you have all ready consulted doctor and he has given you some time to wait till this time I suggest to visit one more orthopedic doctor and neuro spinal Surgeon to discuss your case further in detail and take secondary opinion. Based on the common opinion I suggest to go ahead with treatment planning.Now till the time you go for surgery at home you can do some conservative primary treatment that is taking physiotherapy treatment and physiotherapy specialise spinal exercise program design as per your problems and issues.You can also use hot pack and cold pack on your back painful area to have some more relaxing effect on your soft tissue.Also take postural suggestion for sitting, standing, as well sleeping from physiotherapist to help you in your daily life.Take care."},{"Patient":"My daughter is has constant stomach pain, along with low back pain. The stomach pains persist and don t go away for a few days. She is 23 years old, and eats well. She is not overweight either.

Few of them are gastritis, gastric ulcer, constipation, urinarybtract infection, liver issue or ovarian cyst, etc. How ever there is only one way to rule out the cause is doing ultrasound of abdomen. And as per the ultrasound report later you can visit doctor for detail discussion on treatment.As per me, now I can not diagnose it with any perticular condition since there is no proper history available like when she has more pain? Which part of abdomen she has pain ?Is it increasing from past few days or is it same in terms of pain intensity? As well physical examination also has to be done to see bloating in stomach.

As per your explanation again you had sex in a fertile time period so it can be related to pregnancy. How ever conformation will be possible only after ultrasound and pregnancy test.Here home based pregnancy test with urine drop  can also give good result if it is done one week later of missing period. And ultrasound abdomen immediate can give idea on other issue related to abdomen pain apart from pregnancy and again if it is done 2 weeks later of missing period can give good idea on pregnancy too.Now as of now since you are not well and lots of different symptoms are there so I suggest go for visit of gynecologist and if needed do ultrasound. And based on report go ahead with treatment. Pregnancy test will be needed if you miss your period for more then one week.For lower back pain you can visit physiotherapist and take suggestion on treatment and exercises for spine. Also follow use of hot pack on your pain area at lower back to have some more relief.Take care."},{"Patient":"I woke up this morning with a dull throb in my lower back on the right side.

It does seem to be closer to my spine but it's hard to tell for sure...What do you suggest?","Doctor":"Here you have told you are having this kind of thrombing back pain on and off. And now it's more  from one day. I suggest not to treat the symptom but take proper treatment for the cause.Now to find out the cause you need to check with spinal MRI of your back. And as per the report I suggest to consult orthopedic doctor take suggestion in treatment. It can be with medication and physiotherapy to relax the muscles and reduce inflammation at painful soft tissue. Or else if there is major issue with MRI report then ortho may suggest for surgical correction also.In both above cases you need to follow up with physio for postural correction and advice as well spinal exercuses to improve strength and stamina of spine.If there is no problem in MRI spine and after all if there is still pain in abdomen also then you need to check with ultrasound of abdomen and as per report as well cause of pain need to follow up further treatment for it.For this I suggest to consult your gynec and take proper suggestion and treatment.Usually dull thrombing pain is usually related with spinal problem only.

Here your back pain could be related to various things like muscular pain, due to kidney issue, or disturb spinal disc at that level.How ever the conformation will be done only by physical examination and different reports like ultrasound abdomen to see the kidney issues and x ray or MRI of spine to see spinal issues.If your back pain is radiating to your legs along with numbness or tingling in legs then it can be related to lumbar disc or at that level nerve compression also. Otherwise it will be a muscular pain or pain due to kidney infection.How ever the swelling over that area represent the inflammation at lumbar level where its paining. Usually when ever there is swelling I suggest to use hot and cold pack in combination to reduce swelling as well reduce pain and I suggest same for you too.further diagnosis and treatment can be plan only after physical examjnatiin and diagnosis so I suggest to visit your specialist doctor as early as possible.

As per me the full form of pms is pre menstrual syndrome. Another thing you have told is you have already gone for hysterectomy in that case pms should not be possible with you. Now the next thing you are assuming is urinary tract infection. Lett me tell you urinary tract infection will have some more symptoms like burning micturation as well lower abdominal pain and fever. Kindly check do you have any symptoms like this if not then again it cannot be uti. There are different causes due to which person may have back pain some of them are back muscle weakness, spinal cord problem, disc problem, kidney stone etc, to rule out any of this you need to undergo for mri of lumbar spine as well ultrasound of abdomen based on the report you can visit specialist for detailed treatment discussion.

If yes then it shows me there is a problem at lumbar spine level. This could be lumbar disc issue with loss of normal lumbar curve. However the conformation will be done only by MRI scan. When there is no radiating pain to legs and no symptoms like numbness or tingling then the problem could be only as back muscle weakness or very mild issue at spinal level.Here the conservative treatment will be with few of  pain relieving medication along with muscle relaxants as suggested by your orthopedic doctor and also take physiotherapy treatment along with do spinal exercise to strengthen the spinal muscles.For major damage showing report in MRI spine, orthopedic surgeon will suggest for surgical option.

How ever the conformation will be done by MRI scan of spine.Here based on MRI scan report if it is showing major problem at disc level then orthopedic doctor will suggest for surgical correction.

Thanks","Doctor":"Here your main question is on lower back pain but while giving the symptom explanation you have told a lot about your gastric problem rather then lower back pain. As per my suggestion this both may or may not be related. Let's take a look on your gastric issue:You have symptoms like after food frequent motion, and after that pain in stomach, as well you Don't feel to eat any thing. This all symptoms are indicating towards inflammatory bowel syndrome as well gastric ulcer. To get conformation you need to visit gastro-entrologist  and need to have check properly. You may need to go for endoscopy too. And the report will let you know your problem. As per that discuss with your doctor for possible treatment and early relief.Now let's take a look on back pain: this can be due to back muscle weakness or loss of spinal curve as well spinal disc related issue. I suggest to treat your major problem first that is gastric problem and then if back pain is still not gone then visit a orthopedic take a x ray or MRI and based on report take proper suggestion. Here with minor problem doctor will suggest conservative management like physiotherapy and medication. And for any major issue doctor may suggest for surgical correction. In both the cases my suggestion is follow spinal exercises to improve strength and stamina of your spin.You can also use hot pack in your painful area to have some more relaxing and pain relieving effect on soft tissue.I also want to suggest one more thing correct your life style, food habit, posture of work, Don't take much of tea and coffee as well never take it as only tea or coffee always have some thing along with that to improve your gastric health further.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi I got the Implanon inserted 2 and a half months ago and I ve recently started to get lower back pain..

As well there are many other safer ways are also available to prevent pregnancy so I suggest to think on that option rather then this.Now for your lower back pain since it is only at back level looks like muscular pain and you can take some pain killer along with muscle relaxant tablets. Along with this do take some physiotherapy treatment and follow spinal exercise for better result.For major back pain radiating to legs along with numbness, it need to check with MRI of back to rule out other spinal issue. And based on the MRI report the treatment will be planned. Here it can be conservative with medical management for minor problem or surgical correction for major issues.

As well have good breakfast, average lunch, and minimum dinner preferably before or by 8:00pm not after that, don't have tea and coffee more as well always have some thing along with tea and coffee.

You have told about medial nerve block this is something where your doctor will give steroid injection to particular nerve, which pains you a lot.

For proper treatment, i suggest you to go ahead with spinal mri both for cervical as well as lumbar and as per the report i suggest you to visit orthopaedic doctor. Here if there is a major problem with spine with loss of spinal curve, and disc problem ( disc prolapse or disc degeneration) then doctor will suggest you for surgical correction and later he will ask you to follow up with spinal exercise program. But if there is no much damage in spine then doctor will suggest you for few medications ( muscle relaxant, pain killer, vitamine B etc) and physiotherapy treatment ( conservative management ).

Next your question is how to treat back pain: I suggest if your pain is only at back and not radiating to your legs as well there is no signs like numbness in leg and tingling sensation.

Few basic things while sitting and working is:Make use of back rest complitly that means lean back complete and work keeping your chair as close as possible to your desk, then Dont bend your back or Dont mibe your neck while working on computer just to see the screen. Instead of that correct the screen to suit your eye sight level, Dont bend your knee beyond 90 degree in chair and maintain it beyond it. Instead of that keep it little straight or fold and keep stretching every 15-30 minutes to stretch the nerves and soft tissues.,Twist your back to each side on chair or in standing every 30 minutes.

I am receiving ongoing treatment for this. I was prescribed Percocet for the pain. I began taking them daily, approximately 10 to 25 mgs per day. I also noticed that this caused frequent constipation. I used Milk of Magnesia and laxative pills multiple times a week for this. (I know that continuous use of these things is not recommended, but I figured I would probably only be using them short term.) I stopped taking the Percocet 6 days ago; however, the constipation remained. For the first three days after I stopped taking the pain medication, I ate very little, drank massive amounts of water, and took Colace stool softeners. I could only pass liquid, and I could feel there was a mass that I can only assume is fecal matter in my lower abdomen or possibly colon. Then I tried prune juice, organic bowel cleansing powder, and still only liquid would pass; I could tell that the mass was not moving very much. Yesterday, I tried taking Milk of Magnesia again, then later magnesium citrate, and a saline laxative enema, and this morning, I took about 50 mls of mineral oil. Only liquid will pass.I do have an uncomfortable bloating feeling; however, I do not have abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting. I can feel liquid moving through my abdomen when I take it in, but this mass remains. I have now exhausted every option I could think of. What would you recommend at this point?","Doctor":"Here your main concern  is back pain, for this I suggest to check do you have radiating pain from your back to legs or numbness or tingling sensation from your back to legs. If yes then it could be related to nerve compression at your back along with lumbar disc problem. How ever the conformation can be done only with MRI scan. But if you have only pain at your back and it does not radiate to buttocks or legs then it will be only muscular back pain. For both of this issue you have to visit orthopedic doctor. Suppose if there is major problem in MRI scan report then ortho surgeon may ask for surgical correction. And followed with physiotherapy treatment to relax the soft tissues and for suggestion on spinal exercise.But if there is no major problem in MRI scan then doctor will suggest for medication for relaxing the soft tissues as well some of vitamin B , calcium and vitamine d tablets based on requirement and further treatment again with physiotherapy management.Now the next concern is on your abdominal discomfort and bloating of abdomen. Here for diagnosis two test has to be done. One is ultrasound abdomen and second is colonoscopy to check the problems with abdomen and colon.After this as per the report treatment has to be taken.

How ever the conformation will be done only with pat scan. Now chemo usually is recommended after removal of any cancer with opertation also to kill the remaining cancer cells from the body. It can be chemo or radio therapy based on your doctor diagnosis and treatment planning. Apart from this the neck pain could also be a resion of muscle weakness as spinal level.

I was then given the antibiotics and have now stopped seeing that partner. I have now been with my current partner for two years, and we have been trying for a baby for nine months. Over the last few weeks i have been getting lower abdominal pains which are constantly there, but go from a dull to a sharp pain. I have seen several gps, the first doctor said it was ibs, the second doctor said it was a pulled muscle, and the third doctor said it could be an infection, so i was told to go the STI Clinic. I had tests done and the nurse there seemed to think it could be PID again, so both me and my partner have been given antibiotics which we have both nearly finished. I am still suffering with the pains, and especially after sex. I am growing really concerned as to whether I am infertile and thats why we didnt conceive, or whether the pains and PID could be linked to that?

Your concerns are about the dyspareunia, meaning painful sex, pain in lower abdomen and infertility. The cause is obviously the PID which you have already been diagnosed with .The therapy of both the partners is the most proper treatment and needs to be repeated every month for three months. I would suggest you the following:Repeat the course of an antibiotic, metronidazole, anti-fungal every month for 3 months for both of you. Ultrasonographic evaluation of ovulation.Diagnostic Laparoscopy with tubal patency test.Hormonal Assay of both of you.Semen analysis of your partner.These will help you to get the exact diagnosis and give a plan for treatment."},{"Patient":".hi, i am 23 yrs old guy. i recently found out that i have disc slip in L4-L5 and the pain is bit on higher side though i ride my bike and i travel around 8 km avrg every day. so thought to buy a car so that i ll hav back support while riding , but some say its not good to ride car with back pain and some say it is good what should i do, go for a car or just reduce the travel and opt a bus.

So many times it is related to muscular pain due to weakness of back muscles or over strain pain in back.You can use hot pack at home and do good spinal exercise with suggestion of specialist to strengthen your back and improve back muscle stamina.To check on heart, check that do you get this heart pain along with breathing difficulty ? and how often it happens? Here you have mention only heart beats become fast. It can also be due to anxiety. So do yoga, pranayama regularly and take proper sleep also.Many times just because pain in body also heart beat becomes more so it can be inter related too.As per your question i have suggested you couple of things here in general.specific suggestion is not possible since there is lack of information from your end on past medical history for heart, back, acidity problem as well tablet for what it is?

I want to know that, what is my disease & whether my treatment is going in a correct way? Please suggest me.","Doctor":"Here as per your explanation. I suggest the treatment what your doctor have given is right. Acenac mr is basically for pain and muscle spasm ,  evion LC is with vitamine E which will help for muscles and skin., As per your question here you are not sure what is your problem, here as per your explanation I feel its related to your back. Either it will be related to spinal muscle spasm at your back or it may be related to disc issues at back. At clinic i do various test to check but here you can check on your own do you aave radiating pain ,numbness, tingling sensation from your back to legs if yes then it can be related to disc. How ever conformation ca be done only by MRI. And you can take steps as per it. For severe damage at disc level ortho will suggest for surgery.In your case since its started recently will not be serious. There might be minor or no problem can be detected. For any of this still since there is pain you have to do conservative management that is take the tablet suggested by your doctor and take a back strengthening exercise program from a specialist like physiotherapist. And do it regularly. This will help for to improve strength and stamina of your spine.Your testicle pain may or may not be related with this.

Now to have permanent relief from pain and tingling most important thing is you have to do regular back strengthening, stretching, and twisting exercises.

As your father is too old what I guess I suggest him to take pain killer not on regular basis but only when his back pain is unbearable or disturbing his routine activities.You can also use volidup gel or powergesic-plus gel for local application. It is also very beneficial in relieving the back pain and provide him some comfort. Apart from these he can also go for physiotherapy exercises after an expert opinion of physiotherapist.

You got hit five days back, and you have still problem in every activity. It suggests that you are having a severe back muscle spasm, which requires oral muscle relaxants like tablets containing Chlorzoxazone  250 mg or central muscle relaxants, along with analgesics. Only analgesics would not be sufficient.Also you need rest as work like sitting for long or standing for long may increase the pain further. I would also like to suggest to go for Ultrasound (lower abdomen) to see whether there is any impact of hit on underlying organs.

I don t understand what it is as I don t worry about my weight in the slightest, I have always been slim.","Doctor":"Here you are talking some thing about stone its not clear. Is it some thing you are taking about kidney stone? As well there is no idea about your age, over all weight, how much it was ? and how much it is now? You need to provide your details properly. I will give here generalize answer since many things are not clear.For burning sensation in stomach, it can be acidity problem also, as well it can be gastric ulcer also, here you need to consult a doctor for evaluation and treatment. As well need to change your food habits. Keep snacks minimum, have more of cut fruits in diet. And keep one time for your food intake. Break fast keep it good, lunch keep it average and dinner keep it early by 8:00pm or before and keep it minimum.Next for your chest pain again it can also be related to gastric issue in your case. Since you are not more in weight and loosing weight I am not suspecting any thing with heart. But do consult a doctor if you start getting breathlessness along with chest pain.For your back pain if its only at back then it could be related to spinal muscle weakness or over use soreness. Here you need to check on your working posture as well sleeping posture and the bed also should be suitable for spine. Detail guidelines you will get from physiotherapist. You need to visit physiotherapist and based on your back pain assessment they will suggest you exercise program which you should follow up. This will improve strength and stamina of spinal muscles.As well physio will only advise on ergonomic too and you should follow with that too.Any time if you have radiating pain from back to legs with numbness do consult orthopedic too and go for needed test.Also you can use hot and cold pack on your back for some more pain relief by relaxing and having soothing effect on soft tissues.Take care."},{"Patient":"I pulled my back muscle about 3-4 months age.

Can you advise on my back problem.","Doctor":"As per your explanation I suggest you to visit a physiotherapist and take a good exercise program for your entire spine health. This will help you to improve the strength, stamina and flexibility of your spine.Here you have mention some times morning when you get up you feel pain at your back. It tells me two things. Either your back is weak or there is a problem with your bed as well sleeping posture. If your back is weak again there could be two resion. Either its spinal muscular weakness or it may be related to disc problem. The only way to conform is by doing MRI and checking out your self do you feel any radiating pain from your back to legs ?If yes then it could be related to disc problem.And if there is only spinal muscular weakness Dont worry that will recover once you start following proper spinal exercise program.But I must suggest here do check your bed level  ( it should have even surface )and it should not be too soft or too hard. You can also use hot and cold pack at your painful area to have more of relaxing and sothing effect which will also help for relieving pain if there is any pain.At anytime if you feel the pain have increased in intensity and more frequent as well radiating to legs then do consult specialist for that.Understand one more thing pain is a symptom so Don't treat the pain treat the cause of the pain which will help you to have permanent relief. Taking some time paracetamol is ok but Dont make it your habit. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi dr. I suffer from diverticulitis, I was in the hospital for 3 days March 13 .  I was put on. Gluten free diet by my Dietition and I'm slowly introducing some fiber into my body. However, I saw my GI dr. Last week, I was feeling good until I started taking Metamucil almost a week ago which he told me to do.  I have some Dicyclomine hci 10mg here, which my other GI dr had prescribed when I was seeing her.  Do u think the Dicyclomine would hurt me if I took one for this belly ache, it's not severe pain but I know it's there.  Can u pls give me your thoughts. Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. There is no evidence that dietary modifications are helpful in the management of diverticulitis. If you have simple diverticulitis (no abscesses or perforations) or fever, I suggests that you stay on semi-solid foods (soup, yogurt, etc.) for a week or so, and take over-the-counter pain medication, preferably aspirin. To prevent recurrent diverticulitis, I advise a high-fiber diet, and abstinence from smoking and NSAID use. Anecdotally, Rifaximin, which is a locally acting antibiotic that is poorly absorbed from the gut, may provide symptom relief. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"I have an 8 year old active, healthy daughter who has frequent abdominal pain usually just prior to or during a bowel movement. However, what concerns me is that the last attack while she was still 7 yrs old (1 month ago) she had what looked to be the first menstrual cylce. However, this cycle or bloody, mucus discharge, only lasted a matter of hours and was over. Despite the discharge, the abdominal pain stopped upon having a bowel movement. Any ideas? Is this normal, abnormal? Should I be worried and take her to see her regular pediatrician?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query. Read the history and understood it. The most probable cause of pain in a child -Tummy tonsils- meaning enlargement of the lymph nodes of the abdomen.-Appendicitis- by default this has to be ruled out in every case of pain in -abdomen of a child.-Worms.The best diagnosis is a high resolution ultrasonography. some blood, urine and stool tests.A therapeutic trial with a course of an antibiotic, metronidazole and probiotics under the guidance of a pediatrician / Surgeon always helps to solve the problem and to get a diagnosis.Also given is a dose of medicines active against worms in intestine.I hope a consultation with a Pediatric Surgeon, investigations and a course of an antibiotic and metronidazole should solve the problem.If this is indicative of appendicitis , please go for the surgery of appendectomy."},{"Patient":"hi ,almost one year I do have lower back pain that I can not seat more than half an hour and when I want to stand up to stay tall it takes some time and there is another thing may be its related is about 3month ago all of my neck lymph nodes came out and I felt lumpy things along with pain after 2 weeks they gone and transferred to my breast close to my under arm I think it was my under arm lymph nodes I did blood test and ultrasound for my neck and my breast and every thing is ok but still I have a weak pain at the same time when I went to specialist for my lower back pain he said you have mild sacroiliac artritis and today he got my blood test and my bone scan result he reffered me to romatologist when I explained all of these to him he said you have autoimune desease.now my question is do you think all of things(my lower back pain and my lymph nodes)are related together which one is trigger for the other since I have lots of weakness as well.Thank you","Doctor":"here for normal individuals who does not have auto immune disease, back pain and  lymph node problem at neck level cannot be related to each other but since you are already diagnosed with autoimmune disease it can be related in your case. As per my suggestion you should visit rhematoid specialist and take  specific guidelines from him for your back pain. You can also visit physiotherapist who will guide you with spinal exercise program which will help you to improve strength, stamina as well as flexibility for your spine. Another problem what you explain hear about your lymph node swelling i suggest if its increasing in size then you should take a note on that and visit doctor and take his opinion. You may go for lymph node biopsy to rule out there is no other abnormality other then inflammation.here you also need to understand what happens with the people who have autoimmune disease. There are various type of autoimmune disease but the common problem with all these patients are the body's immune system gets activated against the body's normal cell so that there used to be a inflammation in the body which will create pain and disturbance in normal functioning of body's system. usually we have found people who are on anti inflammatory diet ( omega 3)  or  anti inflammatory drugs used to help against rhematoid conditions. Also doing regular exercise helps to generate certain hormones in body which have healing as well anti inflammatory effect on body cells. So that also helps with this kind of patients.Take care."},{"Patient":"i have had pain in my upper back towards the right side, pain in the neck and also pain from right shoulder down to fingers already had a mri/mra of chest and mri of neck and x-ray of neck and upper spine and a nerve conduction done everything can back normal don't know what it could be any suggestions would help","Doctor":"Hello, I have studied your case.

In medical term it is called as medial border scapular muscle pain.It happens due to loss of cervical curve or else over use injury. But conformation can be done only from cervical x ray.

Also avoid doing any thing which pains you on that shoulder as for example: doing over head activity must be painful.You can also use hot and cold pack frequently and regularly at home to reduce inflammation and produce healing effect at micro level in soft tissue which will also help you for some more pain relief. Also correct your work posture to suit your body need.

I was told I  may have the precursors to gouty arthritis.  I was given ultram for the pain.  Now, in addition to the back pain I am experiencing pins and needles in my back and sometimes chest area especially at times of temperature change like hot baths or a cool breeze.  I am constantly fatigued but I have a poor diet and don't exercise except for my job as a warehouse worker.  Lately I've had some trouble swallowing as well and once or twice unexplained general weakness. Any ideas?","Doctor":"For generalize weakness I suggest to take vitamin b complex as its a energy Booster vitamin,  for gouty arthritis take omega 3suppliment as it is a natural anti-inflammatory supplement and there are many other benefits available along with it.  To reduce uric acid level or production you need to consult a dietician too.  I can suggest some thing that avoid any fruits or vegetable which contain too many seeds like tomato,  brinjal,  red chilli,  etc. And yes doing regular work out is also very important.  Our body also have got healing capacity for any thing goes wrong in the body.  And it works best when we are active doing enough walking a day,  and when body sweats.

So start some good calcium and via d supplement too.  For vitamin d I believe the natural sunlight source is best but for a faster result you can also take some supplement for time being.

But one more thing you can try at home is just take rest keep doing heat foamentation and post that apply a good pain releiving ointment.  And correct your posture for sitting standing and walking activity.  Most important thing when u go for mri do compare it with your previous mri report.  And then if every thing is fine I suggest you should follow a good spinal exercise program.  Which can strengthen your spinal muscles so that the muscles ability to take load can be improved next time.  But of course it's not suggested to lift heavy wait at least for next few weeks.

He is on 100mg of Lyrica twice daily, 10mg amitriptyline once daily, 100mg of tramadol hydrochloride every four hours, 60mg of codeine phosphate hemihydrate with 100mg of paracetamol every four hours, 20mg omeprazole twice a day, and sleeping tablets at night. He can hardly walk up and down our stairs in our home. He is like an old man trapped in a young man's body and we are desperate as we feel we have no where else to turn, we have literally tried everything, ie. physio which the physio therapist said he can not work with my husband ubtil his pain is managed, he has tried reki, acupuncture, meditation and all of the above medication which he is still on. Please can you give us something to go with as we are at our wits end. Thanks, kind regards Miriam","Doctor":"hi miriamNothing to despair as MRI is clear.All he should do is wear a lumbo-sacral brace during daytime,avoid bending,lifting,physical therapy,massage with muscle relaxant gels and reduction of either tramadol or codein,increase of dose of amitryptaline to 25mg instead of 10 mg and use gabapentin 300mg  twice instead of lyrica.Addition of methycobalamin 1000mcg if your doctor agrees.too many opioids make a patient lethargic, and if pain can be relieved by local measure,gels,brace,massage would be saferbest wishes,regards"},{"Patient":"Hi, this is Atif Noor (male, age 31).

Then gradually started jogging and now I do 40 minutes jogging 2-3 days a week. But for few months, I have developed a pain in right side of lower back (may be in pelvic bone).

At this point in time the pain was excruciating, I was a level 9/10 most of the time for about 2& 1/2months, then it would ease a little, then get worse again, the Dr trying any/every type of PT to see what felt better worse, ...& made me undergo a procedure where a dye dwas pumped into each disc affected, & when he hit the one, I screamed bloody murder, & almost passed out, gasping for air, & seeing stars dancing around my head, ... That pain level was about a12 on the 1/10 scale, ... I had the robo-cop/ironman/6million man fusion surgery, with the 2rods, 62&3/4 screws, & 3little clamps holding my lower back together, ...

A consultation with an orthopedician is well appreciated. Loss of excess body weight and using lumbar supporting belt will be helpful also. Hope this may help you. Let me know if anything not clear.

If compression  is more than 30 % of height of vertebra  it should be managed with surgery. So your mri report indicates the amount of  compression  and hence guides treatment.

This sensation is very bothersome and I fear that it will get worse even though I have been tested for practically everything.

Human spine  contains vertebra  and between two vertebra is intervertebral  disc which is named  according to the  location of vertebra.  So l45 disc is located between l4 and L5  vertebra and L5s1  is  between L5 and s1.  These two discs are located in bottom of spine. Now prolapse means this discs has come out of its space and compressing  structures in spinal canal which includes nerves and the car.  So your mri report is suggestive  of  disc prolapse at l45 and l5s1 levels with compression  of  thecal matter and nerve roots.  For assessing severity  of  prolapse  canal diameters are  required which is lacking in your report. So considering your report you require conservative  management.  Avoid forward bending and weight lifting.  Sleep on hard bed. Take tab diclofenac plus thiocolchicoside combination twice a day and tab ultracet one at bedtime. Start physiotherapy with  1. Back strengthening exercises 2 back extension excersise and 3. Abdominal strengthening excersise.  Do this on regular basis and you will get long term relief.

That being said its still not easy to wait for the time until you can have pregnancy test that determines if the cycle has resulted in a pregnancy. But remember that you have done all you can and its time to let nature run its course. Also try not do home based pregnancy test and jump into conclusions because home test have fairly high false results.Try not to obsess about symptoms. Instead keep your mind occupied with things you like doing, try deep breathing as calming technique when you are feeling anxious. Use positive thinking or neutral thinking such as, \\"I don’t know the outcome yet, but I've done all I can to make it happen.\\" Try talking to your partner for moral and emotional support.Coming back to your query, vaginal burning which you have before your AF doesn't mean you will have bleeding.

After reading it I think of the following causes and investigations to be done accordingly. This can be due to the stress and anxiety you have about something for which you should not really bother about, like getting paranoid over getting pregnant. Random pains and uncomfortable feeling in abdomen over 5 months needs to be investigated:*Routine blood investigations like Complete blood picture, blood sugar, urea, creatinine, liver function tests, thyroid function tests.*Urine -routine and microscopy*Stool: routine, microscopy, occult blood, culture and sensitivity.*Ultrasonography of abdomen,*Colonoscopy All these investigations should be within normal limits for one to say you have IBS which is a more possibility in your case.

I finally saved up enough money for an MRI, and they said nothing is wrong with me.  How is this possible?  I can't keep living in this constant pain, I have no quality of life - always on the verge of tears.

Avoid bending or lifting weight objects. You may also apply Kati Basti, an ayurvedic oil that is applied for 30 minutes after warming it up . It gives tremendous relief.

So if urine pregnancy test and ultrasound  report is positive  need to consult obgy  specialist asap. If pregnancy  test is negative  then only thing that remains  is infection.

It is not related to the back ache that you have been experiencing due to a pinched nerve. It is mostly related to either pooling of blood in your lower limbs or thyroid/ liver/ kidney issues.

I know the pain must have gotten severe after stopping and hence you are taking such a high dose of Tylenol. Even though you are taking NAC, 6 grams is a overdose. The daily approved maximum dosage is 4 gm provided liver functions are all good. You should discuss with your physician and cut down of the Tylenol dose and instead substitute it with injections or tablets like Ultram and Toradol provided there are no contraindications.

You also mentioned that it was diagnosed to be from TB of spine. Has it been confirmed by a tuberculin skin test or a biopsy of the vertebrae affected? If on taking TB medications, the pain or numbness do not begin to resolve with in 2-3 months then it is most probably not TB spine. Yes it is true that TB spine is nontransmissible unless there is direct exposure to the infected tissue without proper gear.

Since she has shooting pains in both lower limbs nerve compression  can also be there. Parathyroid  gland secretes hormone calcitonin which maintain bone density.

If report shows abnormalities  take a visit to orthopaedic  surgeon."},{"Patient":"hi, for the past couple days now i haven't been able to keep down my food. everything i eat i feel like its just sitting in my stomach and not digesting at all. i sometimes purge to make it go away. and other times i will throw up on my own. i've also had constipation and i feel as though i'm losing a lot more hair than i usually do. also, i have a stuffy nose and my lower to middle back has been hurting me. i haven't been able to go to the doctors, so i was wondering if you can tell me what you think is wrong?","Doctor":"Dear patient Upper abdominal  pain  and  indigestion  is mostly due to gastritis and upper gi tract ulcer. Constipation  adds to it  and leads to  further decreased  intake and aggravate  gastritis. This both leads to stress and anxiety  which leads to hair loss.  So take a call for gastroenterology  specialist and get yourself  examined.  Endoscopy  of upper gi tract  may be needed. Start tab pantocid 40mg twice a day.  Take syp  lactulose  10 ml three times a day. Take regular small but  frequent diet. Take lots of liquids and fibre diet. All the best."},{"Patient":"My boyfriend is a 33 year old healthy male. 2 weeks ago he had a laprascopic apendectomy. He was discharged on percocet, he was readmitted 4 days later for severe abdominal pain that went right to left and moved to below his rib cage when he lied down. CT showed fluid in the abdomen and a drain was placed ~ 100 ml fluid was drained and he was discharged on flagyl and bactrin.  1 week later he is back in the hospital and had to have fluid drained again, this time from his pelvic area. His only symptom is severe abdominal pain, no fever, no decreased appetite, and he doesnt have an elevated WBC. No one seems to know what is causing this and they are running every test under the sun on the fluid (anearobic, aerobic cultures and fungal tests, gram stain...everything) Hes on dilodid for pain. Could there be another post surgical complication causing this?","Doctor":"HI.Thanks for your query for your boyfriend.The fluid can be due to peritonitis , in response to the bacterial infection by non-specific bacteria.Or you have to discuss about some infections like Tuberculosis which takes many weeks / days to heal up. IT is possible that your friend is suffering from tuberculosis of the abdomen and anti-TB treatment can be started even on empirical basis as it has antibacterial properties on other bacteria too where they will be resistant to the routine antibiotics,"},{"Patient":"I have been running a fever for about 8 days my lower back and kidneys ache as well as my eyes and head, ive had a loss of appetite and feel drained and fatigued, ive been to a doctor and have been on antibiotics for 6 days now with no sign of improvement","Doctor":"Dear patient Ther are two possibilities  considering your symptoms 1. Renal stone with secondary infection 2. Viral fever . Possibilities  of renal calculi with urinary tract infection is likely. I would advise ultrasound of abdomen  and pelvis to locate the site of stone.

Do not neglect your health."},{"Patient":"I've suffered with chronic severe back pain, In the lower back just above the buttocks.

If it's for long duration and  not relieved with medications it should be investigated.  First of all with Xray of  lumbosacral spine anteroposterior and lateral views to rule out bony abnormalities  such as spondylolysis  and spondylilisthesis.  Next is MRI of lumbosacral spine with screening of whole spine to rule out canal stenosis and disc prolapse. So visit radiology center nearby you and get it done.

The back pain is most probably from muscle strain due to non-ergonomic position. The knot sized swelling is mostly a hair follicular infection. The pain from muscular strain can be dealt with by applying hot water packs in the affected area. You should also take complete bedrest for a period of day keep all activities to bare minimum. Once the pain decreases it should help to do back-muscle strengthening exercises. This should prevent further episodes. The best person to see for the pain now would be a physical therapist instead of chiropractitioner. In all probability it will be covered by your insurance. You can also take over-the-counter medications too provided there are no contraindications."},{"Patient":"I have a ten year old boy who has been complaining of different pains on and off for two months now. the two most complained about places are the mid to lower back and pain in his right side just below his ribcage> Both are sensitive to touch and are reccurrent.

I have tried everything, osteopathy, physio and have been seeing a chiropractor for the last 6 months and cannot get anymore than a couple of days without pain. Should I be considering surgery, I am at my wits end! Thanks","Doctor":"Hi,If the pain has been getting worse and you are not able to manage it in spite of all the therapies you have gone through, I think it would be worthwhile to consider surgery. You need to discuss with the physician and also get a thorough neurological examination done so as to accurately decide which nerve impingement is causing most problems and at what level a microdiscectomy would most help. If it is at multi levels, you will probably require fusion surgery. Your spinal surgeon is best equipped with making the decision based on his clinical findings and what the imaging shows. Microdiscectomy is the most oft done procedure and has a really good rate of success of about 95%. Hope this helps you make a decision."},{"Patient":"Ibwasvin a car accident. 8 weeks ago. I have neck an lower pain. I have been to a doctor an have had Ct scans which showed degeneration. Of the lower spine. I am also suffering from a concussion.

Also never had lower back pain before. Why now","Doctor":"Hi,The injury you had sustained during the accident might have precipitated the event. Initially when there is little pain, out body itself tries to rectify it but once it gets out of hand the pain recurs and increases in severity. That is when generally scans will show a bulging disc or a herniated disc impinging upon the nerve. So I would advise you to fix up an appointment with your spine surgeon or physician and get a MRI done to evaluate the spine. Once the report is out you can decide on how to go about it. Initially pain medication along with physical therapy will do the trick. But for some surgery is an option for relentless pain."},{"Patient":"Hi. I woke-up this morning not feeling the greatest b/c at first my lower-back had a dull pain. I still have this mild ache 4hrs later which is kinda going down my right leg.

The last few days i have been very hungary but as soon as I get food infront of me I loose most of my appetite and have had some diarhea/loose stool. To include this morning. Any ideas? Thank you. Amanda","Doctor":"Hi,Going through your symptoms, I think the lower back pain radiating to your leg is a different entity from the pain in the mid to lower abdomen. The pain in your lower back is most probably a muscular strain and you need to initially treat it with hot pack application and over the counter pain medications. If that doesn't help fix an appointment with your physical therapist. Interferential therapy certainly helps in decreasing the pain meanwhile. Once the pain comes down discuss with your physical therapist about the need for exercises to strengthen core muscles. It will go a long way in helping you from getting the pain again. Swimming too is a very good exercise. But all these need to be started after the pain has receded."},{"Patient":"Yes.

Please remember and you must have observed that when you do not have stress your problem with IBS is reducedChange of lifestyle.I think 'may be' you are not coping with something. Vacation outside of your area, mobiles phones to be off.You must have noticed already that these changes help a lot. Try to avoid anything which you are / have to do against your will and wish. Getr into the hobbies which make you forget the world around you.
