Assume the existence of such a table:   Let the rows of the table be denoted by ( mathbf{a}_1, mathbf{a}_2, ldots, mathbf{a}_n ), where each ( mathbf{a}_i ) is a vector of length ( 2022 ) with integer entries.2. Condition on the differences:   For any two rows ( mathbf{a}_i ) and ( mathbf{a}_j ), the difference ( mathbf{a}_i - mathbf{a}_j ) must have all entries congruent modulo ( 2022 ). This means that for any ( k ) and ( l ), the difference ( a_{ik} - a_{jk} equiv a_{il} - a_{jl} pmod{2022} ).3. Consider three rows:   Suppose we have three rows ( mathbf{a}_1, mathbf{a}_2, mathbf{a}_3 ). Define the sums of the differences:   [   x = sum_{k=1}^{2022} (a_{3k} - a_{1k}),   ]   [   y = sum_{k=1}^{2022} (a_{1k} - a_{2k}),   ]   [   z = sum_{k=1}^{2022} (a_{2k} - a_{3k}).   ]4.

Observation on the form of sets S_{a,b}:   - We start by noting that the sets S_{a,b} = {n^2 + an + b mid n in mathbb{Z}} can be simplified based on the parity of a.   - If a is even, let a = 2k. Then:     [     S_{a,b} = {n^2 + 2kn + b mid n in mathbb{Z}}     ]     We can rewrite this as:     [     n^2 + 2kn + b = (n+k)^2 + b - k^2     ]     Hence, S_{a,b} = S_{0, b - k^2}.   - If a is odd, let a = 2k + 1. Then:     [     S_{a,b} = {n^2 + (2k+1)n + b mid n in mathbb{Z}}     ]     We can rewrite this as:     [     n^2 + (2k+1)n + b = (n+k)^2 + (n+k) + b - k^2 - k     ]     Hence, S_{a,b} = S_{1, b - k^2 - k}.2. Reduction to simpler families:   - Based on the above observations, we can reduce the problem to considering sets of the form S_{0,m} and S_{1,m} for some integer m.3. Claim 1: For any m and m', S_{1,m} cap S_{0,m'} neq emptyset:   - We need to find integers n_0 and n_1 such that:     [     n_0^2 + n_0 + m = n_1^2 + m'     ]   - Multiplying both sides by 4 and completing the square:     [     4n_0^2 + 4n_0 + 4m + 1 = 4n_1^2 + 4m' + 1     ]     [     (2n_0 + 1)^2 + 4m = (2n_1)^2 + 4m'     ]     [     (2n_0 + 1 - 2n_1)(2n_0 + 1 + 2n_1) = 4m' - 4m + 1     ]   - Let 2n_0 + 1 - 2n_1 = 1 (which gives n_0 = n_1), and 4n_0 + 1 = 4m' - 4m + 1. This implies:     [     n_0 = m' - m     ]   - Hence, for this pair, the two given sets intersect.4. Claim 2: Let I_0 and I_1 be two index sets such that:   - For m, m' in I_0, m neq m' implies S_{0,m} cap S_{0,m'} = emptyset.   - For n, n' in I_1, n neq n' implies S_{1,n} cap S_{1,n'} = emptyset.   - We need to show that |I_0|, |I_1| leq 2.5. Proof for I_0:   - We want to ensure that no pair (x, y) satisfies:     [     x^2 + m = y^2 + m'     ]     [     (x - y)(x + y) = m' - m     ]   - If m' - m is odd, then the pair:     [     (x, y) = left(frac{m' - m + 1}{2}, frac{m' - m - 1}{2}right)     ]     achieves the equality.   - If 4 mid m' - m, then letting x - y = 2 and x + y = frac{m' - m}{2}, we get:     [     (x, y) = left(frac{m' - m}{4} + 1, frac{m' - m}{4} - 1right)     ]     achieves the equality.   - The only remaining case is m' - m equiv 2 pmod{4}. In this case, there is no solution since x - y equiv x + y pmod{2}, making the product divisible by 4, which is a contradiction.   - If |I_0| geq 3, take three distinct members m, m', and m'' of I_0. From the given conditions, m - m' equiv 2 pmod{4} and m - m'' equiv 2 pmod{4}. Subtraction gives m' - m'' equiv 0 pmod{4}, hence S_{0,m'} cap S_{0,m''} neq emptyset, contradiction.6. Proof for I_1:   - We want to ensure that no pair (x, y) solves:     [     x^2 + x + n = y^2 + y + n'     ]     [     (x - y)(x + y + 1) = n' - n     ]   - Note that x - y and x + y + 1 have opposite parity modulo 4. If n' - n is not divisible by 2, this equation has no solutions.   - If n' - n equiv 2 pmod{4}, letting n' - n = 4u + 2, x - y = 2, and x + y = 2u, we get:     [     (x, y) = left(u + 1, u - 1right)     ]     achieves the pair.   - If 4 mid n' - n, letting n' - n = 4u, we can let x - y = 1 and x + y + 1 = 4u, solving as:     [     (x, y) = left(2u, 2u - 1right)     ]     achieves the pair.   - If |I_1| geq 3, take three members n, n', and n''. We get n - n' is odd, and n' - n'' is odd, hence n - n'' must be even, making S_{1,n} cap S_{1,n''} neq emptyset, contradiction.7.

We start with the given equation:   [   y^3 = x^3 + 8x^2 - 6x + 8   ]   We need to find positive integer solutions for (x) and (y).2. To solve this, we use the technique of bounding. We first consider the expression ((x+2)^3):   [   (x+2)^3 = x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8   ]   We compare this with the given expression (x^3 + 8x^2 - 6x + 8).3.

For our given ellipse, a^2=5 and b^2=1. The distance from the center to the foci of an ellipse is given by c=sqrt{a^2-b^2}, which in our case gives c=sqrt{5-1}=sqrt{4}=2. Therefore, the coordinates of the foci of the ellipse are (0,pm 2).Given that the hyperbola C shares a common focus with the ellipse, and considering the focus is on the y-axis, we can infer that the focus of the hyperbola is also (0,pm 2), which means c=2 for the hyperbola.Let's denote the equation of the hyperbola C as frac{y^2}{a^2}-frac{x^2}{b^2}=1 where a>0 and b>0. For a hyperbola, the relationship between a, b, and c (the distance from the center to a focus) is given by c^2=a^2+b^2. Substituting c=2 into this equation gives us 4=a^2+b^2.The equation of the asymptote for the hyperbola is y=pmfrac{a}{b}x.

However, this specific gravity can also be numerically calculated, as after pouring back, there is 100 mathrm{~cm}^{3} of salt solution-ammonia mixture in the second container, which, according to the problem, weighs frac{96 + 80}{2} = 88 g. Therefore, the specific gravity is frac{88}{100} = 0.88. Considering our previous result,frac{80 + 1.2 x}{100 + x} = 0.88From this,0.32 x = 8, quad text{and thus} quad x = 25 mathrm{~cm}^{3} text{.}Gáspár Ágnes (Szeged, Hunyadi Mátyás g. I. o. t.)II. Solution: The problem can also be solved by reasoning. The 96 g of liquid in the first container, after being poured and poured back, will be 88 g. The 8 g weight loss is due to the fact that x mathrm{~cm}^{3} of salt solution with a specific gravity of 1.2 mathrm{g} / mathrm{cm}^{3} is replaced by the same amount of a salt solution-ammonia mixture with a smaller specific gravity left(0.88 mathrm{g} / mathrm{cm}^{3}right). The change in specific gravity is 1.2 - 0.88 = 0.32 mathrm{g} / mathrm{cm}^{3}, which means that the replacement of every mathrm{cm}^{3} of salt solution results in a decrease of 0.32 g. The 8 g decrease is therefore the result of the replacement of frac{8}{0.32} = 25 mathrm{~cm}^{3} of salt solution.Deák Miklós (Bp. XI., József A. g.

This is because ( f ) is a strictly increasing function from (mathbb{N}) to (mathbb{N}), and the smallest value in (mathbb{N}) is 1.

Given Conditions:   We are given that ( f(2) = 2 ) and ( f(mn) = f(m)f(n) ) for every pair of relatively prime positive integers ( m ) and ( n ).3. Odd ( n ):   For any odd ( n ), we have ( f(2n) = f(2)f(n) = 2f(n) ).4. Claim: ( f(3) = 3 ):   Let ( f(3) = k ). Then, ( f(6) = f(2 cdot 3) = f(2)f(3) = 2k ).5. Bounding ( f(5) ):   Since ( f ) is strictly increasing, ( f(4) ) must be between ( f(3) ) and ( f(5) ). Therefore, ( k + 2 leq f(5) leq 2k - 1 ).6. Bounding ( f(10) ):   Using the multiplicative property, ( f(10) = f(2 cdot 5) = f(2)f(5) = 2f(5) ). Since ( f(5) leq 2k - 1 ), we have ( f(10) leq 4k - 2 ).7. Bounding ( f(9) ):   Similarly, ( f(9) = f(3^2) = f(3)^2 = k^2 ). Since ( f(9) leq 4k - 3 ), we have ( k^2 leq 4k - 3 ).8. Bounding ( f(18) ):   Using the multiplicative property again, ( f(18) = f(2 cdot 9) = f(2)f(9) = 2k^2 ). Since ( f(18) leq 8k - 6 ), we have ( 2k^2 leq 8k - 6 ).9. Bounding ( f(15) ):   Using the multiplicative property, ( f(15) = f(3 cdot 5) = f(3)f(5) = kf(5) ). Since ( f(5) geq k + 2 ), we have ( f(15) geq k(k + 2) ). Also, since ( f(15) leq 8k - 9 ), we have ( k(k + 2) leq 8k - 9 ).10. Solving the Inequality:    Combining the inequalities, we get:    [    k(k + 2) leq 8k - 9 implies k^2 + 2k leq 8k - 9 implies k^2 - 6k + 9 leq 0 implies (k - 3)^2 leq 0    ]    Therefore, ( k = 3 ).11.

Initial Claim:   We claim that the maximum number of (120^circ) angles is 2.3. Setup:   Consider a cyclic heptagon (ABCDEFG). If two adjacent angles are equal, then the sides are symmetric with respect to their perpendicular bisector, contradicting our original condition of different-length sides.4. Case Analysis:   - Suppose there are 3 non-adjacent angles equal to (120^circ), say (angle B = angle D = angle F = 120^circ).   - Let (O) be the circumcenter of the circle.5. Angle Calculation:   - Since (angle B = 120^circ), the arc subtended by (angle B) is (240^circ) (since the central angle is twice the inscribed angle).   - Similarly, (angle D = 120^circ) implies the arc subtended by (angle D) is (240^circ).   - (angle F = 120^circ) implies the arc subtended by (angle F) is (240^circ).6. Contradiction:   - If (angle B = angle D = angle F = 120^circ), then the central angles (angle COA = angle COE = angle EOG = 120^circ).   - This implies that the sum of these central angles is (360^circ), which is the total angle around point (O).   - However, this configuration would force (angle GOA = 0^circ), which is impossible in a geometric figure.7. Conclusion:   - Therefore, having 3 non-adjacent (120^circ) angles leads to a contradiction.   - Hence, the maximum number of (120^circ) angles in such a 7-gon is 2.The final answer is (boxed{2})."},{"problem":"Translate the given function f(x) = sin 2x such that all points on its graph are shifted to the right by dfrac{pi}{4} units to obtain the graph of the function g(x).

To ensure this, we need both critical points of the function, which are the minimum at x = 1 and the points where f(x) = 3, within our interval [a, b].Finding the values for x when f(x) = 3:f(x) = x^2 - 2x = 3x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0x = frac{2 pm sqrt{2^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (-3)}}{2 cdot 1}x = frac{2 pm sqrt{16}}{2}x = 1 + sqrt{4} text{ or } 1 - sqrt{4}x = 3 text{ or } x = -1Now we can identify two cases for a and b:1. If a = -1, then since the range must include -1, the value of b must be greater than or equal to 1. However, it can't be greater than 3 as that's the other point where f(x) = 3. This gives us 1 leq b leq 3.2. If b = 3, then since the range must include 3, the value of a must be less than or equal to 1. However, it can't be less than -1 as that's the other point where f(x) = -1. This gives us -1 leq a leq 1.From both cases, we conclude that the minimum value of b-a would occur when b = 1 and a = -1, or vice versa, giving us a minimum of 1 - (-1) = 2. The maximum value of b-a occurs when b = 3 and a = -1, giving us a maximum of 3 - (-1) = 4.Therefore, the range of possible values for b-a is boxed{[2, 4]}."},{"problem":"Given the sets A={x|x^{2}-3x-10leqslant 0} and B={x|m-4leqslant xleqslant 3m+2}.1.

So now we can focus on expanding (1+x+x^{2})(1-x)^{10}.We can simplify the term (1+x+x^{2})(1-x)^{10} by using the identity 1+x+x^{2} = (1-x^{3}).

This occurs when r=4 in (1-x)^{9} (which will give us an x^{4} term) and when r=1 in (1-x^{3}) (which will combine with an x^{3} term from (1-x)^{9} to give an x^{4} term). Therefore, we calculate two coefficients:For r=4, the coefficient in (1-x)^{9} is C_{9}^{4}.For r=1, the coefficient in (1-x)^{9} is -C_{9}^{1} (notice the negative sign due to the (-x)^{r}).The coefficient of x^{4} is thus the sum of these two values:C_{9}^{4} - (-C_{9}^{1}) = C_{9}^{4} + C_{9}^{1} = 126 + 9 = 135.Therefore, the coefficient of x^{4} in the expansion is boxed{135}, which corresponds to option B."},{"problem":"## Problem B2A and B are opposite corners of an n times n board, divided into n^{2} squares by lines parallel to the sides.

Let n be a strictly positive integer. Domitille has a rectangular grid divided into unit squares. Inside each unit square is written a strictly positive integer. She can perform the following operations as many times as she wishes:- Choose a row and multiply each number in the row by n.- Choose a column and subtract n from each integer in the column.Determine all values of n for which the following property is satisfied:Regardless of the dimensions of the rectangle and the integers written in the cells, Domitille can end up with a rectangle containing only 0s after a finite number of operations.","solution":"Solution to Exercise 7 For mathrm{n}=1, if we start from a configuration with one column of two rows, with different integers on these two rows, the difference between the two integers remains invariant when one of the two operations is performed. Consequently, it cannot be canceled. In particular, Domitille cannot arrive at a rectangle containing only 0s in a finite number of steps.We now assume that n>2. Consider the rectangle with one column of two rows with values 1 and 0. By looking at what happens modulo n-1, we see that multiplication by n has no effect, and the second operation preserves the difference between the two values. Thus, the difference between the two values modulo n-1 is an invariant, initially non-zero. Consequently, it is impossible to make the two numbers equal bmod n-1, and in particular to make them both zero.Now let's show that Domitille can always reach 0 in the case n=2.First, reduce the problem. If Domitille can handle the case where there is only one column, it is sufficient for her to deal with the columns one by one. Once a column is brought to 0, the only operation that its cells will undergo when processing the other columns will be the multiplication of a row by mathrm{n}. But since the elements of the column are zero, this actually has no effect.We can therefore assume that the rectangle is in fact composed of only one column. Then, if we can make two cells of the column equal, we can merge them, that is, each time we multiply the row of the first by mathrm{n}, we do the same for the second. In this case, the two cells will always contain the same value. We can therefore restrict ourselves to the case where the column contains 2 cells with the integers a and b. By multiplying each of the rows by 2, we can actually assume that a and b are even. We then subtract 2 from the smallest until it is 2. This is possible because neither a nor b is zero. Then we apply the \\"double then subtract\\" operation: we double the one that is 2, then subtract 2 from the column, until both numbers are 2. We have thus reduced to a configuration where all the numbers in the column are 2. We then subtract 2 from the column, and we have thus nullified the column, which concludes. Note also that the integers in all the other columns remain non-zero during all these manipulations.Comments from the graders: Very few students tackled this problem, but those who did had excellent writing. Too bad some forgot the case n=1. One student attempted a proof by the principle of the minimum, which unfortunately did not lead to a conclusion."},{"problem":"Solve the system of equationsbegin{aligned}& cos x+cos y+cos z=frac{3 sqrt{3}}{2} & sin x+sin y+sin z=frac{3}{2}end{aligned}","solution":"I. solution.

Imagine the problem as if we had to represent the vector frac{3 sqrt{3}}{2}+i frac{3}{2} as the sum of three unit vectors in the complex plane.

Given the length of the chord is also r, we can infer that the chord and the two radii connecting the ends of the chord to the center of the circle form an equilateral triangle. This is because all three sides of the triangle are equal in length to the radius r.An equilateral triangle has three equal interior angles, each measuring 60^circ. Since the central angle of the circle corresponds to one of the interior angles of the equilateral triangle, the central angle must also be 60^circ. To express this angle in radians, we use the conversion that 180^circ is equivalent to pi radians. Therefore, 60^circ is equal to frac{1}{3} of 180^circ, which means the central angle in radians is frac{pi}{3}.To summarize, the steps are:1. Recognize that the chord and the radii form an equilateral triangle.2. Recall that each angle in an equilateral triangle measures 60^circ.3. Convert degrees to radians, knowing that 180^circ = pi radians.4.

Therefore, there must exist at least two elements ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( |a - b| leq 3 ).Conclusion:[boxed{505}]"},{"problem":"The set of points formed by the intersection of the line y = 2x + 1 and the y-axis is (　　).A. {0，1}B. {(0，1)}C. left{-frac{1}{2}，0right}D. left{left(-frac{1}{2}，0right)right}","solution":"To find the point of intersection between the line y = 2x + 1 and the y-axis, we can set x = 0 because all points on the y-axis have an x-coordinate of 0.Solving the system:begin{cases} x=0 y=2x+1end{cases}we substitute x = 0 into the second equation to get y = 2(0) + 1, which simplifies to y = 1.

What can we say about the ellipse if the line perpendicular to P R at P is exactly the tangent at P?","solution":"I. solution. Let the canonical equation of the ellipse be frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1, and the coordinates of point P be x_{1} and y_{1}. Then the coordinates of the other points are:Qleft(x_{1}, 0right), quad Rleft(frac{x_{1}}{2}, 0right), quad O(0,0)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_7a247e76e863029235feg-1.jpg?height=566&width=865&top_left_y=411&top_left_x=619)Since P is a point on the ellipse: frac{x_{1}^{2}}{a^{2}}+frac{y_{1}^{2}}{b^{2}}=1. The equation of the tangent line to the ellipse at point P - as is well known -frac{x_{1}}{a^{2}} x+frac{y_{1}}{b^{2}} y=1its normal vector is mathbf{n}left(frac{x_{1}}{a^{2}}, frac{y_{1}}{b^{2}}right). According to the conditions of the problem, overrightarrow{R P} is perpendicular to this tangent, so overrightarrow{R P} | mathbf{n}. Therefore, there is a real number lambda such that overrightarrow{R P}=lambda mathbf{n}.Since overrightarrow{R P}=overrightarrow{O P}-overrightarrow{O R}, we have overrightarrow{R P}=frac{x_{1}}{2} mathbf{i}+y_{1} mathbf{j}, and thusfrac{x_{1}}{2}=lambda frac{x_{1}}{a^{2}} quad text { and } quad y_{1}=lambda frac{y_{1}}{b^{2}}Expressing lambda, we get lambda=frac{a^{2}}{2} and lambda=b^{2}, so a^{2}=2 b^{2}. Since a and b are positive, this means that a=sqrt{2 b}.Accordingly, there is indeed an ellipse for which the assumption holds for every point - even for the endpoints of the major axis - and every such ellipse has a major axis that is sqrt{2} times the length of the minor axis. An interesting consequence of this is that the distance between the two foci is exactly equal to the length of the minor axis.Every step we have taken is reversible, so this condition is also sufficient.II. solution. Draw the circle centered at O with a radius equal to the semi-major axis of the ellipse! The ellipse is the image of this circle under a perpendicular affinity, if we choose the line of the major axis as the axis of the affinity. Let P^{prime} be the point on the circle corresponding to P. The tangent line to the circle at this point and the tangent line to the ellipse at P intersect on the major axis at a point S.The right triangle S P R is divided into two similar triangles by the altitude P Q, and for the sides of these triangles, we have:P Q: S Q=R Q: P Q, quad text { or } quad P Q^{2}=S Q cdot Q RSimilarly, in the right triangle S P^{prime} O:P^{prime} Q: S Q=O Q: P^{prime} Qand since O Q=2 R Q, we have P^{prime} Q^{2}=2 S Q cdot Q R. Comparing these:P^{prime} Q^{2}=2 P Q^{2}, quad text { or } quad frac{P Q}{P^{prime} Q}=1 / sqrt{2}so the ratio of the affinity is 1: sqrt{2}.Since the minor axis is the image of the circle's diameter under the affinity, and the major axis is the circle's diameter, in this ellipse, the major axis is sqrt{2} times the length of the minor axis."},{"problem":"If the complex number frac {b+i}{2+i} is a pure imaginary number, then the real number b equals (   )A: 3B: - frac {1}{2}C:  frac {1}{3}D: -1","solution":"Analysis:This problem tests the multiplication and division operations of complex numbers in algebraic form and the basic concepts of complex numbers.

Compute the modulus of z_1 as follows:|z_1| = left|frac{2}{1+i}right| = sqrt{2},since multiplying the numerator and denominator by 1 - i (the conjugate of 1 + i), in order to rationalize the denominator, we get:|z_1| = left|frac{2(1-i)}{(1+i)(1-i)}right| = left|frac{2(1-i)}{2}right| = |1 - i| = sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = sqrt{2}.Now, consider the condition |z - a - bi| = |z_1|:sqrt{(x-3)^2 + (y-3)^2} = sqrt{2}.This means the complex number z corresponds to a point on the circle with center (3,3) and radius sqrt{2}. The modulus |z| represents the distance from the point to the origin (0,0) on the complex plane.To find the minimum distance from the origin to any point on the circle, we can visualize this geometrically. The shortest distance from the origin to the circle is along the line connecting the origin to the center of the circle, less the radius of the circle. The distance from the origin to the center (3,3) is 3sqrt{2} by Pythagoras' theorem, so the minimum distance is:|z|_{text{min}} = 3sqrt{2} - sqrt{2} = 2sqrt{2}.Therefore, the minimum modulus of z is:boxed{2sqrt{2}}."},{"problem":"[Pythagorean Theorem (direct and inverse) ] [ Diameter, chords, and secants ]The tangent and the secant, drawn from the same point to the circle, are perpendicular to each other.

Consider a more general problem, replacing 2019 with a positive integer n (n geqslant 4).Below is the proof: In a convex n-gon where no three diagonals have a common point, the maximum number of colored intersections such that no colored cycle exists is frac{n(n-3)}{2}-1.First, prove that the number of colored intersections must be less than frac{n(n-3)}{2}.Proof by contradiction.Assume the number of colored intersections is not less than frac{n(n-3)}{2}. Consider a planar graph where the vertices correspond to the diagonals of the polygon, and the edges correspond to the colored intersections. Since the number of diagonals in a convex n-gon is frac{n(n-3)}{2}, the number of edges in this planar graph is at least the number of vertices. Therefore, the graph contains a cycle. It is easy to see that the cycles in the graph correspond one-to-one with the colored cycles in the polygon. Thus, there exists a colored cycle, which is a contradiction.Next, find a way to color frac{n(n-3)}{2}-1 intersections such that no colored cycle exists. Use induction.When n=4, the conclusion is obvious.Assume the conclusion holds for a convex n-gon, i.e., for any convex n-gon, there exists a way to color frac{n(n-3)}{2}-1 intersections such that no colored cycle exists.Now consider a convex (n+1)-gon A_{1} A_{2} cdots A_{n+1}.For the n-gon A_{1} A_{2} cdots A_{n}, by the induction hypothesis, frac{n(n-3)}{2}-1 intersections have been colored. Adding the vertex A_{n+1}, the edge A_{1} A_{n} in the n-gon A_{1} A_{2} cdots A_{n} is transformed into a diagonal in the convex (n+1)-gon A_{1} A_{2} cdots A_{n+1}, and n-2 additional diagonals A_{n+1} A_{i} (i=2,3, cdots, n-1) are added. Thus, the diagonal A_{1} A_{n} contains exactly n-2 intersections (corresponding to the added diagonals), and all of them are colored.Finally, color one intersection on a diagonal passing through A_{n+1} that is not on A_{1} A_{n}, for example, the intersection of A_{n+1} A_{2} and A_{1} A_{3} (due to the convexity of the polygon, this intersection is inside the (n+1)-gon, so it is an \\"intersection\\").

Among the newly colored n-1 points, adjacent intersections only appear on the diagonals A_{1} A_{n} or A_{n+1} A_{2}. Additionally, each diagonal passing through A_{n+1} contains one colored intersection, meaning no adjacent colored intersections appear on these diagonals.It is easy to see that if a colored cycle exists, since the colored intersections in A_{1} A_{2} cdots A_{n} do not form a cycle, at least two diagonals passing through A_{n+1} must have colored intersections not on A_{1} A_{n}, which is a contradiction.

Understanding the Problem:   - We have a ( 57 times 57 ) grid.   - We need to find the smallest ( k ) such that any configuration of ( k ) black cells will guarantee the existence of a rectangle with its vertices at the centers of these black cells.2. Pigeonhole Principle:   - Consider the rows of the grid. Each row has 57 cells.   - If we place ( k ) black cells in the grid, we can distribute them among the 57 rows.   - Let ( a_i ) be the number of black cells in the ( i )-th row.3. Counting Pairs of Black Cells in Rows:   - For each row ( i ), the number of ways to choose 2 black cells from ( a_i ) black cells is given by ( binom{a_i}{2} ).   - The total number of pairs of black cells in all rows is ( sum_{i=1}^{57} binom{a_i}{2} ).4. Bounding the Number of Pairs:   - We need to ensure that the total number of pairs of black cells in all rows exceeds the number of pairs that can be formed without forcing a rectangle.   - The maximum number of pairs that can be formed without forcing a rectangle is ( binom{57}{2} ).5. Applying the Pigeonhole Principle:   - We need ( sum_{i=1}^{57} binom{a_i}{2} > binom{57}{2} ).   - Simplifying, we get:     [     sum_{i=1}^{57} frac{a_i(a_i - 1)}{2} leq frac{57 cdot 56}{2} = 1596     ]   - This inequality is satisfied when all ( a_i ) are equal to 8, because:     [     sum_{i=1}^{57} binom{8}{2} = 57 cdot 28 = 1596     ]   - Therefore, if each row has 8 black cells, we have exactly 1596 pairs, which is the maximum without forcing a rectangle.6. Finding the Smallest ( k ):   - If each row has 8 black cells, the total number of black cells is ( 57 cdot 8 = 456 ).   - To ensure that there must be a rectangle, we need at least one more black cell, making ( k = 457 ).The final answer is ( boxed{457} )."},{"problem":"5.

Understanding ( f(n) ):   - ( f(n) ) is the smallest positive integer ( k ) such that ( n^k equiv 1 pmod{211} ).   - This means ( f(n) ) is the order of ( n ) modulo 211.   - Since 211 is a prime, the order of any integer ( n ) modulo 211 must divide ( phi(211) = 210 ).2. Rewriting the Sum:   - We need to find the remainder when ( sum_{n=1}^{210} n f(n) ) is divided by 211.   - We can rewrite the sum as ( sum_{k mid 210} k (text{sum of numbers with order } k) ).3. Sum of Numbers with a Given Order:   - We need to determine the sum of numbers with a specific order ( k ).   - We will use properties of polynomials and Vieta's formulas to find these sums.4. Case Analysis:   - Case 1: ( k = 1 ):     - The only number with order 1 is 1 itself.     - Sum of numbers with order 1 is ( 1 ).   - Case 2: ( k ) has one prime factor:     - Numbers with order ( k ) must be roots of ( x^k equiv 1 pmod{211} ).     - The sum of all roots of ( x^k equiv 1 pmod{211} ) is 0 by Vieta's formulas.     - Since the sum of numbers with order 1 is 1, the sum of numbers with order ( k ) is ( -1 ).   - Case 3: ( k ) has two prime factors:     - Let ( k = ab ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are primes.     - The sum of numbers with order ( k ) is ( 0 - (text{sum of numbers with order } 1) - (text{sum of numbers with order } a) - (text{sum of numbers with order } b) ).     - By previous cases, this sum is ( 0 - 1 - (-1) - (-1) = 1 ).   - General Case:     - If ( k ) has ( n ) prime factors, the sum of numbers with order ( k ) is ( (-1)^n ).5.

Therefore, option A is incorrect.Option B: The minimum value of f(x) is -2.- By setting sin x = 1, we find the minimum value of the function:[f(x) = -2(1 + frac{1}{2})^2 + frac{5}{2} = -2 cdot frac{9}{4} + frac{5}{2} = -frac{9}{2} + frac{5}{2} = -2.]Thus, option B is correct.Option C: The graph of the function f(x) is symmetric about the line x=frac{pi}{2}.- Given that f(x) takes its minimum value at x=frac{pi}{2} and satisfies f(pi - x) = f(x), the function is indeed symmetric about the line x=frac{pi}{2}. Therefore, option C is correct.Option D: The function f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0,frac{pi}{2}).- The function f(x), being a transformation of -2(sin x + frac{1}{2})^2, indicates a parabola opening downwards.

Solving for m, we obtain m = -1 (m = 2 is not a valid solution in this context).Next, solving the system of equations:begin{cases} y = kx - 1  x^2 = 8y end{cases}, by eliminating y, we get x^2 - 8kx + 8 = 0. Letting the discriminant Delta' = 64k^2 - 32 = 0, we find k^2 = frac{1}{2}.Upon verification, k^2 = frac{1}{2} and m = -1 satisfy the conditions.Now, |x_1 - x_2| = sqrt{(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2} = sqrt{frac{72}{25} - 4left(-frac{18}{5}right)} = frac{12sqrt{3}}{5}.

We will prove that this is the only solution.First, we will show that f is bijective, meaning it takes on every real number exactly once. If c is any real number, then substituting y=left(c-(f(x))^{2}right) into (1) shows that f takes on the value c. We still need to prove that different numbers are mapped to different values. Let y_{1} and y_{2} be two different numbers and x be arbitrary. According to (1),fleft(x^{2}+fleft(y_{1}right)right)=y_{1}+(f(x))^{2}andfleft(x^{2}+fleft(y_{2}right)right)=y_{2}+(f(x))^{2}If fleft(y_{1}right)=fleft(y_{2}right) were true, then the left side of both equations would be the same number. This, however, contradicts the fact that the right sides are different. Therefore, fleft(y_{1}right) neq fleft(y_{2}right), and the function is indeed bijective.Second, we will prove that the function is odd, meaning for every real number x, f(-x)=-f(x), and specifically, f(0)=0. Let x neq 0 and y be arbitrary. Write the identity (1) for the pairs x, y and -x, y:begin{aligned}& fleft(x^{2}+f(y)right)=y+(f(x))^{2} & fleft(x^{2}+f(y)right)=y+(f(-x))^{2}end{aligned}Since the left sides are the same, (f(x))^{2}=(f(-x))^{2}, which implies |f(x)|=|f(-x)|; on the other hand, because of the bijectivity of f, f(x) neq f(-x). From these, it follows that f(-x)=-f(x) neq 0. We see that f takes the value 0 only at 0, so f(0) can only be 0; thus, f is indeed odd.Now, substitute 0 for x in (1); we get that for any y, f(f(y))=y.We will also show that f is monotonically increasing, meaning if a leq b are two real numbers, then f(a) leq f(b). Let c be a number such that b=a+c^{2}. (Since a leq b, such a number exists.)

Let x be arbitrary. If f(x)<x, then f(f(x))<f(x), which is a contradiction. If f(x)>x, then f(f(x))>f(x), which is also a contradiction. Therefore, only f(x)=x is possible."},{"problem":"Problem 3.5.

Similarly, a geq 1, a geq 1 / a, and c geq 1, c geq 1 / c. Taking the above into account, from the first equation we haveb=frac{1}{3}left(a+1+frac{1}{a}right) leq frac{1}{3}(a+a+a)=aand from the other two that c leq b and a leq c. Combining the above inequalities, we get a leq c leq b leq a.

Similarly, from the other two equations we have c geq 1 and a geq 1.Suppose that a is the smallest of the three values a, b, c (the other cases are analogous). In particular, 0<a leq b. Then we have a^{2}+a+1=3 a b geq 3 a^{2}, so 2 a^{2} leq a+1. The function 2 x^{2} can only be less than or equal to the function x+1 if x leq 1. Therefore, a leq 1, and thus a=1.The first equation then becomes 3 b=3, so b=1. And from the second equation, we get c=1.

Assuming both mathrm{A} and mathrm{B} play perfectly, for how many values of s the player A cannot win?","solution":"Solution. Denote by k the sought number and let left{s_{1}, mathrm{~s}_{2}, ldots, mathrm{s}_{k}right} be the corresponding values for s. We call each s_{i} a losing number and every other nonnegative integer a winning numbers.## Clearly every multiple of n is a winning number.Suppose there are two different losing numbers s_{i}>s_{j}, which are congruent modulo n. Then, on his first turn of play, player A may remove s_{i}-s_{j} stones (since n mid s_{i}-s_{j} ), leaving a pile with s_{j} stones for B. This is in contradiction with both s_{i} and s_{j} being losing numbers.Hence, there are at most n-1 losing numbers, i.e. k leq n-1.Suppose there exists an integer r in{1,2, ldots, n-1}, such that m n+r is a winning number for every m in mathbb{N}_{0}.

Let m^{prime} in mathbb{N}_{0}, be such that s+u+2 leq m^{prime} n+r leq s+u+n+1. In order for m^{prime} n+r to be a winning number, there must exist an integer p, which is either one, or prime, or a positive multiple of n, such that m^{prime} n+r-p is a losing number or 0 , and hence lesser than or equal to u. Since s+2 leq m^{prime} n+r-u leq p leq m^{prime} n+r leq s+u+n+1, p must be a composite, hence p is a multiple of n (say p=q n ). But then m^{prime} n+r-p=left(m^{prime}-qright) n+r must be a winning number, according to our assumption. This contradicts our assumption that all numbers m n+r, m in mathbb{N}_{0} are winning.Hence, each nonzero residue class modulo n contains a loosing number.There are exactly n-1 losing numbers .Lemma: No pair (u, n) of positive integers satisfies the following property:(*) quad In mathbb{N} exists an arithmetic progression left(a_{t}right)_{t=1}^{infty} with difference n such that each segmentleft[a_{i}-u, a_{i}+uright] contains a prime.Proof of the lemma: Suppose such a pair (u, n) and a corresponding arithmetic progression left(mathrm{a}_{t}right)_{t=1}^{infty} exist.

We need to find the relationship between s^2 and r.Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ACB:[ AC^2 + BC^2 = AB^2 = (2r)^2 = 4r^2 ]4. By the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality:[ frac{AC + BC}{2} ge sqrt{AC cdot BC} ]Squaring both sides:[ left( frac{AC + BC}{2} right)^2 ge AC cdot BC ][ frac{s^2}{4} ge AC cdot BC ]5. We also know from the Pythagorean theorem:[ AC^2 + BC^2 = 4r^2 ]Using the identity for the product of roots of a quadratic equation:[ (AC + BC)^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 + 2 cdot AC cdot BC ][ s^2 = 4r^2 + 2 cdot AC cdot BC ]6. Substituting the inequality from AM-GM:[ frac{s^2}{4} ge AC cdot BC ][ s^2 ge 4 cdot AC cdot BC ][ s^2 ge 4 cdot frac{s^2}{4} ][ s^2 ge s^2 ]This inequality is always true, but it does not provide a useful bound. Instead, we use the identity:[ s^2 = 4r^2 + 2 cdot AC cdot BC ]Since AC cdot BC le r^2 (as AC and BC are both less than or equal to 2r):[ s^2 le 4r^2 + 2r^2 = 6r^2 ]However, this is not tight. We need to find the maximum possible value of s^2. By considering the maximum value of AC cdot BC:[ AC cdot BC le r^2 ][ s^2 = 4r^2 + 2 cdot r^2 = 6r^2 ]Thus, the correct bound is:[ s^2 le 8r^2 ]The final answer is boxed{s^2 le 8r^2}"},{"problem":"7.

If they arrive at the destination within the limit, they are equally likely to do so. Let's denote the time when A and B arrive as (x) and (y) respectively, where (0 leq x, y leq 10). They will meet if the difference in their arrival times is less than or equal to 3 days, i.e., (|x - y| leq 3). To find the probability, we can visualize the problem on a coordinate plane where the x-axis represents A's arrival time and the y-axis represents B's arrival time. The region where they meet is the area between the lines (y = x + 3) and (y = x - 3) within the square defined by (0 leq x, y leq 10). The total area of the square is (10 times 10 = 100). The area where they do not meet consists of two triangles, each with a base and height of 7. The area of each triangle is (frac{1}{2} times 7 times 7 = 24.5). Therefore, the total area where they do not meet is (2 times 24.5 = 49). The area where they meet is (100 - 49 = 51).

Define a New Function g(x):    - We start by defining g(x) = f(x+1). This implies that g(x-1) = f(x).   - Since f(x) = 2|x-1| + log_{3}(x-1)^{2}, we can rewrite it as f(x) = 2|x-1| + 2log_{3}|x-1|.   - Therefore, g(x) = 2|x| + 2log_{3}|x|.2. Analyze the Symmetry and Monotonicity of g(x):   - We find that g(-x) = 2|-x| + 2log_{3}|-x| = g(x), indicating that y = g(x) is an even function.   - For x > 0, g(x) = 2x + 2log_{3}x is monotonically increasing.   - For x < 0, y = g(x) is monotonically decreasing.3.

Find the Range of a:   - From -x-2 leq ax-1 leq x+2, we get -1-frac{1}{x} leq a leq 1+frac{3}{x}.   - The function y = -1-frac{1}{x} is monotonically increasing for x in (1,2]. Thus, at x = 2, we have {(-1-frac{1}{x})}_{max} = -frac{3}{2}.   - Similarly, the function y = 1+frac{3}{x} is monotonically decreasing for x in (1,2].

We need to calculate  F (6) .Suppose we incorrectly place all letters by putting letter  L_1  in envelope  K_i  ( i ne 1 ). There are  2  cases:a) Letter  L_i  ends up in envelope  K_1 . The remaining  4  letters must then be incorrectly placed in the remaining  4  envelopes, which can be done in  F (4)  ways.

To find the value of n, we can express 4 as a power of 8: 8^n = 8^{frac{1}{2}}. Therefore, equating the exponents of the same base, we conclude that: n = frac{1}{2}. With the value of n determined, the function becomes: y=x^{frac{1}{2}}. Considering the second point (-8, m), we now substitute x with -8: y = m = (-8)^{frac{1}{2}}. Since the exponent frac{1}{2} corresponds to the square root function and the square root of a positive number is defined, but the square root of a negative number is not defined in the set of real numbers, we identify an error in the initial solution. The assumption that n=frac{1}{2} led us to an undefined calculation. Let's go back and find the correct exponent n that will work for both points.Reevaluating the equation with the correct point (8, 4): 8^n = 4 = 2^2. Express both sides as powers of 2: (2^3)^n = 2^2. Applying the laws of exponents: 2^{3n} = 2^2. Now we equate the exponents: 3n = 2. Solving for n: n = frac{2}{3}. Therefore, the corrected function is: y=x^{frac{2}{3}}. Now, we can substitute x with -8 again to find m:[begin{align*}y = m &= (-8)^{frac{2}{3}} &= left((-8)^2right)^{frac{1}{3}} &= (64)^{frac{1}{3}} &= 4.end{align*}]We can confirm the correctness as the cubic root of a negative number is defined, and the square of -8 is positive.Thus, we obtain: m = boxed{4}.

Given: A = {0, |x|, y} and B = {x, xy, sqrt{x-y}}, and A = B.2. Distinct Elements in Sets: Since A = B, every element in A must match with every element in B. This implies that the elements 0, |x|, y in A correspond to x, xy, sqrt{x-y} in B, but not necessarily in the same order.3. Non-zero Elements: From A, we see that |x| neq 0, which implies x neq 0. Similarly, since xy is an element of B, and x neq 0, it follows that y neq 0 as well.4. Solving for sqrt{x-y}=0: Given that A and B are equal sets, and considering the distinctiveness and non-zero conditions, we deduce that sqrt{x-y} = 0.

The rules are that a year divisible by 4 is a leap year unless it is divisible by 100 but not 400. So 1948, 2000 are leap years, but 1900 is not. There are 365 = 52·7 + 1 days in a non-leap year and 366 = 52·7 + 2 days in a leap year. Suppose that NY day in year 0 is day 0 and that year 0 is the year after a leap year. Suppose that we do not encounter any centuries. So NY day in year 1 is day 1, NY day in year 2 is day 2 etc. We get: Leap * * * * * * * Year 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Day 0 1 2 3 5 6 0 1 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 6 0 1 2 4 5 6 0 2 3 4 5 0 This is periodic with period 28 years. Note that in a complete period we have just 4 of each day. Now 100 = 3·28 + 16, so if NY day 2001 is day 0, then NY day 2101 would be day 6. But since 2100 is not a leap year, it is actually day 5. Similarly, NY day 2201 is day 3 and NY day 2301 is day 1. However, NY day 2401 is not day 6, but day 0, because 2400 is again a leap year. So we have a period of 400 years. Note that in years 0-15 above we have 2 of each day except 1 and 3 which both have 3 days. Thus in the 100 NY days starting with day 0 in 2001, we an excess of 1 each for days 1 and 3. 2001-2100 (NY day 2001 is day 0) excess of 1 each for day 1 and day 3 2101-2200 (NY day 2101 is day 5) excess of 1 each for day 6 and day 1 2201-2301 (NY day 2201 is day 3) excess of 1 each for day 4 and day 6 2301-2400 (NY day 2301 is day 1) excess of 1 each for day 2 and day 4 Thus over the whole 400 year period we find that if day 0 has n NY days, then we get day 0 has n day 1 has n+2 day 2 has n+1 day 3 has n+1 day 4 has n+2 day 5 has n day 6 has n+2 Note that 1 Jan = 32 Dec = 62 Nov = 93 Oct = 23 Oct + 70, so NY day 1949 is a Saturday. Hence NY day 1977 also. So NY day 2000 (23 years later) is also a Saturday (referring to the table above). So NY day 2001 is a Monday (2000 was a leap year). So day 6 is Sunday.

A cuboid can be uniquely determined within the cube by taking a pair of planes parallel to each of the cube's different pairs of faces, which pass through the appropriate vertices of the small sugar cubes. Since the large cube is 4 times 4 times 4, 5 different suitable planes can be taken parallel to a given pair of faces; thus, a pair of planes can be chosen in binom{5}{2}=10 ways. The cube has three different pairs of faces, and a pair of planes can be chosen independently for each of these, so in total 10^{3}=1000 different cuboids are defined by the sugar cubes forming the 4 times 4 times 4 cube.II. solution. Place the 4 times 4 times 4 cube in a three-dimensional coordinate system so that its vertices are the points A(0 ; 0 ; 0), B(4 ; 0 ; 0), C(4 ; 4 ; 0), D(0 ; 4 ; 0), E(0 ; 0 ; 4), F(4 ; 0 ; 4), G(4 ; 4 ; 4) and H(0 ; 4 ; 4). Then a cuboid can be defined by the two endpoints of a space diagonal. Let's count how many space diagonal vectors can be taken (in this case, two vectors are considered different if their starting and ending points do not match, so even vectors of the same length and direction are considered different in the given case). A vector will be a space diagonal vector if and only if none of the coordinates of its starting and ending points match. The coordinates of the points we are examining can only be 0,1,2,3 or 4, so we are examining a total of 5^{3}=125 points. To a given point, 4^{3}=64 suitable points can be assigned that form a space diagonal vector with it. Therefore, a total of 125 cdot 64=8000 different space diagonal vectors have been taken. Each cuboid has 4 space diagonals, and each of these can be taken as a vector in two directions; thus, we counted each cuboid 8 times.

Notice that:   [   frac{x}{1+frac{yz}{x}} = frac{x^2}{x + yz}   ]   Similarly, we have:   [   frac{y}{1+frac{zx}{y}} = frac{y^2}{y + zx} quad text{and} quad frac{z}{1+frac{xy}{z}} = frac{z^2}{z + xy}   ]3. Therefore, the inequality can be rewritten as:   [   sum_{text{cyc}} frac{x^2}{x + yz}   ]4.

Since (xy + yz + zx = 1), we can rewrite the denominator:   [   sum_{text{cyc}} (x + yz) = sum_{text{cyc}} x + sum_{text{cyc}} yz = sum_{text{cyc}} x + 1   ]6. Therefore, we have:   [   sum_{text{cyc}} frac{x^2}{x + yz} geq frac{left(sum_{text{cyc}} xright)^2}{sum_{text{cyc}} x + 1}   ]7. Next, we use the fact that (left(sum_{text{cyc}} xright)^2 geq 3 sum_{text{cyc}} xy = 3) (by the AM-GM inequality):   [   left(sum_{text{cyc}} xright)^2 geq 3   ]8.

To find the largest possible value of (M), we need:   [   frac{3}{sum_{text{cyc}} x + 1} geq M   ]10. This implies:    [    3 geq M left(sum_{text{cyc}} x + 1right)    ]11.

Therefore:    [    3 geq M (sqrt{3} + 1)    ]13. Solving for (M), we get:    [    M leq frac{3}{sqrt{3} + 1}    ]14.

Breaking down the expression step by step:1. Recognize that lg represents the base-10 logarithm, so lg2 is essentially asking for the power to which 10 must be raised to get 2, and similarly lg5 is the power to which 10 must be raised to get 5. Since lg2 and lg5 are just constants, we can't simplify those any further without a calculator. Since we are adding them together, we can use a logarithmic property that states log_b(m) + log_b(n) = log_b(m times n), where b is the base of the logarithm. So we can combine lg2 and lg5 as follows:      lg2 + lg5 = lg(2 times 5) = lg10   2. Because the base of the logarithm is 10, and we have lg10, we know that lg10 = 1 because 10 raised to the power of 1 is 10.3. Simplify the last term ( frac {1}{2})^{-2}. The negative exponent here means we take the reciprocal of frac{1}{2}, and then square it.

(The substring 08 is omitted from this list because it is the same integer as the substring 8 , which is already listed.)What is the greatest integer N such that no integer substring of N is a multiple of 9? (Note: 0 is a multiple of 9.)","solution":"The answer is 88,888,888.In our solution, we'll make use of the well-known fact that an integer is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits (in base 10) is divisible by 9. It was permissible to use this fact without proof on the contest, but for the sake of completeness, a proof can be found in the appendix following this solution.No integer substring of 88,888,888 is divisible by 9 , since 9 does not divide 8 k for any k=1, ldots, 8.We now show that every N>88,888,888 has an integer substring divisible by 9 .Suppose N>88,888,888. If N has 8 digits, then one of those digits must be 9 , which constitutes an integer substring by itself, so we are done. Thus, we assume from now on that N has 9 or more digits.We claim that for any such N, there is some integer substring divisible by 9 . In fact, we will describe an algorithm to find such a substring, using N=328,346,785 as an illustrative example. For 0 leq k leq 9 , let s_{k} be the sum of the first k digits of N, where we define s_{0} to be 0 . We can think of s_{k} as a \\"running total\\" of the digits; here is our example number with s_{0}, ldots, s_{9} written below it:![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_6cb05c45fe7c141f3316g-3.jpg?height=147&width=558&top_left_y=1428&top_left_x=729)Next we consider the remainders left by s_{0}, ldots, s_{9} when they are divided by 9 . We have ten remainders with only nine possible values. By the pigeonhole principle, some two remainders must be equal. For instance, in our example, two of the remainders are equal to 5 :![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_6cb05c45fe7c141f3316g-3.jpg?height=241&width=583&top_left_y=1766&top_left_x=714)Suppose it is s_{j} and s_{k} that leave the same remainder (where j<k ). Then s_{k}-s_{j} is divisible by 9 . But s_{k}-s_{j} is the sum of the digits of the integer substring consisting of the (j+1)^{text {th }} through k^{text {th }} digits of N. In the example above, for instance, this substring is 834678 :![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_6cb05c45fe7c141f3316g-3.jpg?height=136&width=496&top_left_y=2206&top_left_x=760)and we have 8+3+4+6+7+8=41-5=36, a multiple of 9 .Since we have an integer substring whose digits add up to a multiple of 9 , that substring is itself a multiple of 9 , and we are finished.Appendix. Here is the proof of the \\"well-known fact\\" mentioned at the beginning. To keep the notation simple, we state the proof for 4-digit integers; it should be clear how to generalize to integers with any number of digits.Let n=underline{a b c d}, where the underline means we are writing the digits of n. By the nature of base 10 representation, we havebegin{aligned}n & =1000 a+100 b+10 c+d & =(999+1) a+(99+1) b+(9+1) c+d & =(999 a+99 b+9 c)+(a+b+c+d) .end{aligned}The first bracketed quantity is a multiple of 9 . Thus, n and a+b+c+d differ by a multiple of 9 . In particular, if n is a multiple of 9 , then so is a+b+c+d (the sum of its digits), and vice versa.

P_0=1, so now we can build it up:P_1=0,P_2=frac{1}{2},P_3=frac{1}{4},P_4=frac{3}{8},P_5=frac{5}{16},P_6=frac{11}{32},P_7=frac{21}{64},P_8=frac{43}{128},P_9=frac{85}{256},P_{10}=frac{171}{512},Thus the answer is 171+512=boxed{683}Solution 2 (also easiest)Consider there to be a clockwise and a counterclockwise direction around the triangle.  Then, in order for the ant to return to the original vertex, the net number of clockwise steps must be a multiple of 3, i.e., #CW - #CCW equiv 0 pmod{3}.  Since #CW + #CCW = 10, it is only possible that (#CW,, #CCW) = (5,5), (8,2), (2,8).In the first case, we pick 5 out of the ant's 10 steps to be clockwise, for a total of {10 choose 5} paths.  In the second case, we choose 8 of the steps to be clockwise, and in the third case we choose 2 to be clockwise.  Hence the total number of ways to return to the original vertex is {10 choose 5} + {10 choose 8} + {10 choose 2} = 252 + 45 + 45 = 342.

Then use the exponentiation method of squaring ( A*A---(A^2)*(A^2)---(A^4*A^4)--(A^8*A^2) to get the transition value of 342. Divide by 2^10 for the probability, reduce fractions, for the result of 171+512 = 683.Solution 4.1 (solution 4 but rigorized and generalized)As a note, do NOT do this on the exam as it will eat up your time, but feel free to experiment around with this if you have a good enough understanding of linear algebra. This writeup will be extremely lengthy because I am assuming just very basic concepts of linear algebra. The concepts here extend to higher levels of mathematics, so feel free to explore more in depth so that you can end up solving almost any variation of this classic problem.4.1.1: Conceptual SetupThere are a possible of 3 states for this problem, so we can model the problem as a stochastic process. The resulting process has a transition matrix of:[hat{T} = begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0.5 & 0.5 0.5 & 0 & 0.5 0.5 & 0.5 & 0 end{bmatrix}]We aim to diagonalize this transition matrix to make it easier to exponentiate by converting it into what's known as it's Jordan Canonical Form. 4.1.2: Eigenvalue/vector bashIn order to do this, we must extract the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix. The eigenpolynomial for this matrix is obtained by calculating this matrix's determinant with 0-lambda about it's main diagonal like so:[hat{T}_{lambda} = begin{bmatrix} 0-lambda & 0.5 & 0.5 0.5 & 0-lambda & 0.5 0.5 & 0.5 & 0-lambda end{bmatrix}]We have the matrix's eigenpolynomial to be lambda^3 - frac{3lambda}{4} + frac{1}{4}, and extracting eigenvalues by setting the polynomial equal to 0, we have 2 eigenvalues: lambda_1 = 1 of multiplicity 1, and lambda_2 = -frac{1}{2} of multiplicity 2. To extract the eigenvectors, we must assess the kernel of this matrix (also known as the null space), or the linear subspace of the domain of hat{T} where everything gets mapped to the null vector. We first do this for lambda_1. Taking -lambda_1 across the diagonals to get hat{T}_{lambda_1} = begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0.5 & 0.5 0.5 & -1 & 0.5 0.5 & 0.5 & -1 end{bmatrix}, we first reduce it to reduced row echelon form, which is begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 0 & 1 & -1 0 & 0 & 0 end{bmatrix}. From here, we compute the kernel by setting  [begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 0 & 1 & -1 0 & 0 & 0 end{bmatrix} begin{bmatrix} x_1 x_2 x_3  end{bmatrix} = 0]. So if we take our free variable x_3 = 0 = t, then that means that in the same fashion, x_1 - x_1 = x_2 - x_2 = 0 = t, so hence, the kernel of hat{T}_{lambda} = begin{bmatrix} t t t end{bmatrix}, or more simply, tbegin{bmatrix} 1 1 1 end{bmatrix}. begin{bmatrix} 1 1 1 end{bmatrix} is the eigenvector corresponding to lambda_1. We do the same computations for our second unique eigenvalue, but I will save the computation to you. There are actually 2 eigenvectors for lambda_2, because the reduced row echelon form for hat{T}_{lambda_2} has 2 free variables instead of 1, so our eigenvectors for lambda_2 are begin{bmatrix} -1 1 0 end{bmatrix}, begin{bmatrix} -1 0 1 end{bmatrix}. We are now ready to begin finding the Jordan canonical form4.1.3 Jordan Canonical FormIn linear algebra, the JCF (which also goes by the name of Jordan Normal Form) is an upper triangular matrix representing a linear transformation over a finite-dimensional complex vector space. Any square matrix that has a Jordan Canonical Form has its field of coefficients extended into a field containing all it's eigenvalues. You can find more information about them on google, as well as exactly how to find them but for now let's get on with the problem. I will skip the computation in this step, largley because this writeup is already gargantuan for a simple AIME problem, and because there are countless resources explaining how to do so.We aim to decompose hat{T} into the form hat{T} = SJS^{-1}, where S is a matrix whose columns consist of the eigenvectors of hat{T}, J is the Jordan matrix, and S^{-1} is, well, the inverse of S. We have 1 eigenvalue of multiplicity 1, and 1 of multiplicity 2, so based on this info, we set our eigenvalues along the diagonals like so.We have:[J = begin{bmatrix} -frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 0 & -frac{1}{2} & 0 0 & 0 & 1 end{bmatrix}, S = begin{bmatrix} -1 & -1 & 1 0 & 1 & 1 1 & 0 & 1 end{bmatrix}, S^{-1} = frac{1}{3}begin{bmatrix} -1 & -1 & 2 -1 & 2 & -1 1 & 1 & 1 end{bmatrix}]and so:[hat{T} = begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0.5 & 0.5 0.5 & 0 & 0.5 0.5 & 0.5 & 0 end{bmatrix} = SJS^{-1} = begin{bmatrix} -1 & -1 & 1 0 & 1 & 1 1 & 0 & 1 end{bmatrix}begin{bmatrix} -frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 0 & -frac{1}{2} & 0 0 & 0 & 1 end{bmatrix}begin{bmatrix} -frac{1}{3} & -frac{1}{3} & frac{2}{3} -frac{1}{3} & frac{2}{3} & -frac{1}{3} frac{1}{3} & frac{1}{3} & frac{1}{3} end{bmatrix}]Now that we have converted to Jordan Canonical Form, it is extremely easy to compute hat{T}^n.4.1.4: Using the JCF to calculate the transition matrix to the power of any n, large or smallIt is an important fact that for any matrix K with Jordan decomposition SJ_kS^{-1}, we have that K^n = S(J_k)^nS^{-1}Using this fact, we aim to find the general solution for the problem. J^n = begin{bmatrix} left(-frac{1}{2}right)^n & 0 & 0 0 & left(-frac{1}{2}right)^n & 0 0 & 0 & 1 end{bmatrix}, and using the laws of matrix multiplication, [SJ^n = begin{bmatrix} (-1)^{n+1}left(frac{1}{2}right)^n & (-1)^{n+1}left(frac{1}{2}right)^n & 1 0 & left(-frac{1}{2}right)^n & 1 left(-frac{1}{2}right)^n & 0 & 1 end{bmatrix}]So finally, our final, generalized transition matrix after any number of steps n is:[hat{T}^n = begin{bmatrix} frac{1}{3} - frac{1}{3}(-1)^{1+n}(2)^{1-n} & frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{3}(-1)^{n+1}(2)^{1-(1+n)} & frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{3}(-1)^{n+1}(2)^{1-(1+n)} frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{3}(-1)^{n+1}(2)^{1-(1+n)} & frac{1}{3} - frac{1}{3}(-1)^{1+n}(2)^{1-n} & frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{3}(-1)^{n+1}(2)^{1-(1+n)} frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{3}(-1)^{n+1}(2)^{1-(1+n)} & frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{3}(-1)^{n+1}(2)^{1-(1+n)} & frac{1}{3} - frac{1}{3}(-1)^{1+n}(2)^{1-n} end{bmatrix}]4.1.5 just plugging in for this problem lolFor the sake of this problem, we seek the top left element, which is frac{1}{3} - frac{1}{3}(-1)^{1+n}(2)^{1-n}. Substituting n=10 readily gives the probability of the bug reaching it's starting position within 10 moves to be frac{171}{512} implies m+n = boxed{683}And we have also derived formulae for the bug reaching any state within n moves as a byproduct!~RedFlame2112Solution 5 (guess & check)This method does not rigorously get the answer, but it works. As the bug makes more and more moves, the probability of it going back to the origin approaches closer and closer to 1/3. Therefore, after 10 moves, the probability gets close to 341.33/1024. We can either round up or down. If we round down, we see 341/1024 cannot be reduced any further and because the only answers on the AIME are below 1000, this cannot be the right answer. However, if we round up, 342/1024 can be reduced to 171/512 where the sum 171+512= boxed{683} is an accepted answer.Solution 6 (generating functions)The generating function for this is (x+x^2) since an ant on any vertex of the equilateral triangle can go 120 degrees or 240 degrees to a side and simplifying (x^{120}+x^{240}) gets you (x+x^2). Since 360 degrees brings you back to the original vertex then we must find the sum of the coefficients that share a variable with a power divisible by 3.Since we take this rotation 10 times, our function becomes (x+x^2)^{10} which is the same as x^{10}(x+1)^{10}. This completely simplified is x(x+1)^{10} and since your maximum power is 11, we only have to find the coefficients for 3, 6, and 9 (0 would apply here but the x is the lowest power there is).For x^9, the coefficient is {10 choose 2} , and the same goes for x^3. For x^6, the coefficient is {10 choose 5} and the final sum for the numerator is 2*{10 choose 2} + {10 choose 5} . The total sum is 90+252=342 and for the denominator, it was simply 2^{10} and this simplified was 171/512. Therefore the sum is 683.Solution 7 (trees)Start of with any vertex, say A. Denote a_n the number of paths ending where it started. Then notice that for a path to end in the vertex you started on, you must have for the (n-1) case that of the 2^{n-1} total paths, we must take away the paths that end in the (n-1)-st term where it started off. (Because imagine on the (n-1) move that it landed on vertex A. Then if we wanted to find the number of length n paths that end at A, we would be able to find that path, because on the (n-1)-st move it landed at A. You can't go from A to A). Hence we have the recursion a_n=2^{n-1}-a_{n-1}, with a_3 = 2. Now reiterating gives us a_{10} = 342, so that the probability is frac{342}{2^{10}} = frac{171}{512}. So we have 171 + 512 = boxed{683}.~th1nq3r(Note: One might be confused because you might think maybe \\"But we only did it for case A. Now for B and C. Oh wait they are symmetric. So then if this is the correct answer, why am I wrong, or what happened to that factor of 3?\\" Well truth be told, I skipped a somewhat major step. Notice that the total amount 2^n only comes from if we START OFF at vertex A. So we really need to multiply 2^n by 3 to get 3(2^n) as the TRUE total amount. However this factor of 3 doesn't matter because now that we do case work, let a_n once again denote the number of paths starting at vertex A. Then abusing symmetry, we have that the number of paths ending where it started as 3(a_n)=3(2^{n-1}-a_{n-1}). So now when we take the probability, we cancel the factor of 3, and obtain the same answer as if it were for all three vertices).Video Solution by Sal Khan[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKMNRcctwL4&list=PLSQl0a2vh4HCtW1EiNlfW_YoNAA38D0l4&index=20](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKMNRcctwL4&list=PLSQl0a2vh4HCtW1EiNlfW_YoNAA38D0l4&index=20) - AMBRIGGS"},{"problem":"## Problem StatementCalculate the volumes of the bodies bounded by the surfaces.frac{x^{2}}{16}+frac{y^{2}}{9}+frac{z^{2}}{100}=1, z=5, z=0","solution":"## SolutionIn the section of the given figure by the plane z= const, there is an ellipse:frac{x^{2}}{16}+frac{y^{2}}{9}=frac{100-z^{2}}{100}The area of an ellipse with radii a and b is pi cdot a cdot bBy the definition of the radius of an ellipse:begin{aligned}& frac{x^{2}}{16 cdot frac{100-z^{2}}{100}}+frac{y^{2}}{9 cdot frac{100-z^{2}}{100}}=1 rightarrow a=frac{4}{10} sqrt{100-z^{2}} ; b=frac{3}{10} sqrt{100-z^{2}} & Rightarrow S=pi a b=pi cdot frac{4}{10} sqrt{100-z^{2}} cdot frac{3}{10} sqrt{100-z^{2}}=frac{12 pi}{100} cdotleft(100-z^{2}right) & V=int_{0}^{5} S(z) d z=frac{12 pi}{100} int_{0}^{5}left(100-z^{2}right) d z=left.frac{12 pi}{100}left(100 z-frac{z^{3}}{3}right)right|_{0} ^{5}= & =frac{12 pi}{100}left(100 cdot 5-frac{5^{3}}{3}-100 cdot 0+frac{0^{3}}{3}right)=frac{4 pi}{100}left(3 cdot 500-3 cdot frac{125}{3}right)=frac{1375 cdot 4 cdot pi}{100}=55 piend{aligned}Source — «http://pluspi.org/wiki/index.php/������������ %D0%9A%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%BE%D0%B2 %D0%98%D0%BD%D1%82 % mathrm{D} 0 % mathrm{~B} 5 % mathrm{D} 0 % mathrm{~B} 3 % mathrm{D} 1 % 80 % mathrm{D} 0 % mathrm{~B} 0 % mathrm{D} 0 % mathrm{BB} % mathrm{D} 1 % 8 mathrm{~B} quad 20-25 » Categories: Kuznetsov's Problem Book Integrals Problem 20 mid Integrals- Last modified: 10:33, 22 June 2010.- Content is available under CC-BY-SA 3.0.## Problem Kuznetsov Integrals 20-26## Material from PlusPi"},{"problem":"Given that the function f(x) satisfies f(x)={f'}(2)e^{x-2}-f(0)x+frac{1}{2}x^{2}, the interval where f(x) is monotonically decreasing is ( ).A: (-infty ,0)B: (1,+infty )C: (-infty ,1)D: (0,+infty )","solution":"To analyze the function f(x) and determine the interval where it is monotonically decreasing, we follow these steps:1.

To settle the debt, the royal tax collector cut off one tenth of the land owned by the farmer, after which the farmer was left with ten acres of land.How much land did he have at first?Alice was about to give the wrong answer, butshe promptly caught herself, thought for a moment, and found the right answer.How much land did the farmer have?","solution":"60. How much land is there? The problem usually gives an incorrect answer: 11 acres. If the farmer originally owned 11 acres of land, the tax collector would have cut off 1 frac{1}{10} acres (which is 1 / 10 of 11 acres), and the farmer would be left with 99 / 10 acres instead of 10, as required by the problem. Therefore, 11 acres cannot be the correct answer.How to get the correct answer? Let's approach the solution as follows. After the tax collector cut off 1 / 10 of the plot, the farmer was left with 9 / 10 of the original plot area. Thus, 9 / 10 of the original plot area equals 10 acres. This means that multiplying the original plot area by 9 / 10 gives the area of the reduced plot, which is 10 acres. Therefore, to return from the area of the reduced plot to the area of the original plot, the area of the reduced plot must be divided by 9 / 10! As is known, dividing by 9 / 10 is the same as multiplying by 10 / 9, so multiplying 10 acres by { }^{10} / 9 gives { }^{100} / 9, or 11^{1} / 9 acres.Verification. The area of the original plot is 11 frac{1}{9} acres. One tenth of 11 frac{1}{9} is 1 frac{1}{9}.

Some of the representations can be considered of the same type - as indicated by the capital letter labels - for example, 3+2+0+0 and 4+3+0+0 are of the same type because they contain two zeros and two other different digits. It is obvious that the same number of different ordered numbers can be formed from representations of the same type.From the A type representations, only 1 four-digit number can be formed, as the non-zero digit can only be in the first position. For the B type, the first position can be filled in 2 ways - for example, in the case of 4+1+0+0, we can write 4 or 1 there - then the position of the other different digit can be chosen in 3 ways, and finally, the two equal digits are written in the remaining empty positions. Continuing the example with the number starting with 4:4100 ; quad 4010 ; quad 4001 .Thus, from each B type representation, 2 cdot 3=6 valid numbers can be obtained. Similarly, for the C type, 3 numbers can be formed, for the F type again 6 (since after filling the first position, the remaining set of digits is the same as in B), and from the G type, with 4 ways to choose the position of the digit that appears only once, 4 numbers.For the E type representations, the first position can be filled in 3 ways, the next in 3 ways for each starting digit - now even with 0 - the third in 2 ways from the remaining two digits, and thus the digit that ends up in the last position is always determined. Thus, 3 cdot 3 cdot 2=18 different orders are obtained. Similarly, it turns out that if we start with 1 for H, we get 3 cdot 2=6 numbers, and starting with 2 and 3, we get 3 each, like in C, totaling 12. Finally, for D, 6 orders are obtained similarly when starting with the repeating digit, and 3, like in B, when starting with the non-zero digit that appears only once, totaling 9.Summarizing, the number of four-digit numbers that can be formed from theA,B, quad C,D,E,G,Htype representations are respectively1, quad 6, quad 3, quad 1818, quad 6,6, quad 4,12,thus the number of numbers sought for the sum of digits being 5, 6, and 7, respectively, isbegin{array}{lr}1+2 cdot 6+2 cdot 9+4 & =35 1+2 cdot 6+2 cdot 3+9+18+6+4 & =56 1+3 cdot 6+3 cdot 9+18+2 cdot 4+12 & =84end{array}Katona Viktor (Heves, General Secondary School II. grade) Blaskó Gábor (Kazincbarcika, Irinyi J.

A four-digit number can be visualized by starting from a point on a straight line and successively measuring segments of length equal to the first, then the second, the third, and finally the fourth digit. To highlight the zeros, instead of the second, third, and fourth digits, we measure segments one unit longer. This way, a four-digit number, where the sum of the digits is n, is represented by a segment of length n+3, which is divided into 4 parts by 3 internal points. Conversely, we can uniquely read off which number a divided segment represents, if the length of each part is an integer multiple of the unit, not greater than 10 times. In our case, the value of n is 5, 6, or 7, so the length of each part is also less than 10. The number of numbers in question is therefore equal to the number of ways to choose 3 points from the n+2 internal division points of a segment divided into n+3 parts.An internal point can be chosen in n+2 ways, the second from the remaining in n+1 ways, and the third in n ways; however, in this way, we get the same triplet of points, whether we chose the leftmost, middle, or rightmost point first, and from the other two, we could choose either one second and the other third.

Since these lines are parallel to the intersection line n, they are parallel to each other, one in alpha and one in beta. Hence, statement B is correct.- Statement C: If alpha parallel beta, then alpha and beta have no common points, which implies that a line l subset alpha cannot be perpendicular to the plane beta because for l to be perpendicular to beta, they would need to intersect, which contradicts the parallelism. Thus, statement C is incorrect.- Statement D: If alpha perp beta, then the lines in alpha that are parallel to the intersection line (where alpha intersects beta) are also parallel to beta. This is because the direction of these lines does not intersect beta and remains parallel to it. Therefore, statement D is correct.Given the analysis above, we conclude that the incorrect statement among the options provided is:boxed{C}"},{"problem":"A circle is inscribed in a triangle with side lengths 8, 13, and 17.

It is required that when scanning from left to right, the cumulative number of 1s is not less than the cumulative number of 0s. Try to find how many numbers satisfy this condition.","solution":"Below are two solutions.Solution 1: Let p_{2n} be the number of such numbers. The number of ways to fill 2n positions with n 1s is binom{2n}{n}. The remaining n positions are automatically filled with 0s. Subtracting the number of invalid schemes from binom{2n}{n} gives the desired result. An invalid number is one where, when scanned from left to right, the cumulative count of 0s exceeds the cumulative count of 1s.The characteristic of an invalid number is that when scanned from left to right, there must be a certain odd position 2m+1 where the cumulative count of 0s first exceeds the cumulative count of 1s, with m+1 0s and m 1s. In the subsequent 2(n-m)-1 positions, there are n-m 1s and n-m-1 0s. If the 0s and 1s in this part of 2(n-m)-1 positions are swapped, making it consist of n-m 0s and n-m-1 1s, the result is a 2n-bit number composed of n+1 0s and n-1 1s. That is, an invalid number corresponds to a permutation of n+1 0s and n-1 1s.Conversely, any 2n-bit number composed of n+1 0s and n-1 1s, since the number of 0s is two more, and 2n is even, must have a certain odd position where the cumulative count of 0s exceeds the cumulative count of 1s. Similarly, in the subsequent part, swapping 0s and 1s makes it a 2n-bit number composed of n 0s and n 1s. That is, a 2n-bit number composed of n+1 0s and n-1 1s must correspond to an invalid number.The above method establishes a one-to-one correspondence between 2n-bit numbers composed of n+1 0s and n-1 1s, and 2n-bit numbers composed of n 0s and n 1s where the cumulative count of 0s exceeds the cumulative count of 1s when scanned from left to right.For example, 1010dot{0}101 is an 8-bit binary number composed of 4 0s and 4 1s, but when scanned from left to right, at the 5th position (marked with *), the cumulative count of 0s 3 exceeds the cumulative count of 1s 2, corresponding to a 10100010 composed of 3 1s and 5 0s.Conversely, 10100dot{0}010 corresponds to 10100101.Thus, invalid 2n-bit numbers correspond one-to-one with permutations of n+1 0s and n-1 1s, hencebegin{aligned}p_{2n} & =binom{2n}{n}-binom{2n}{n+1}=(2n)!left[frac{1}{n!n!}-frac{1}{(n-1)!(n+1)!}right] & =(2n)!left[frac{n+1}{(n+1)!n!}-frac{n}{(n+1)!n!}right]=frac{(2n)!}{(n+1)!n!} & =frac{1}{n+1}binom{2n}{n}end{aligned}Solution 2: This problem can be one-to-one corresponded to the path from the origin (0,0) to the point (n, n), requiring that the points (a, b) passed through satisfy the relation a leqslant b.The corresponding method is to start from (0,0) and scan the 2n-bit number from left to right. If a 1 is encountered, move one step in the positive y-direction; if a 0 is encountered, move one step in the positive x-direction. Since there are n 0s and n 1s, it corresponds to a path from (0,0) to (n, n). Since the cumulative count of 1s must not be less than the cumulative count of 0s, it can pass through points on the diagonal OA but must not cross the diagonal. Conversely, a path satisfying this condition corresponds to a 2n-bit binary number that meets the requirements.The problem is transformed into finding the number of paths from (0,0) to (n, n) that pass through points on or above the diagonal OA.The discussion of the number of paths from one point to another is covered in Chapter 1. As shown in Figure 2-23, the path from O to A passing through points on or above the diagonal OA corresponds to a path from O' to A' passing through points on or above the diagonal O'A'. This is obvious.The path from O' to A' passing through points on the diagonal OA is the path from O' to A' crossing the diagonal O'A'. Hence, it corresponds to a path from O to A crossing the diagonal OA.Therefore, the number of paths from O to A passing through points on or above the diagonal OA is equal to the number of all paths from O' to A' minus the number of paths from O' to A' passing through points on the diagonal OA. That is,begin{aligned}& p_{2n}=binom{2n}{n}-binom{2n}{n+1}=(2n)!left[frac{1}{n!n!}-frac{1}{(n+1)!(n-1)!}right] = & frac{1}{n+1}binom{2n}{n}=h_{n+2}end{aligned}"},{"problem":"Given plane vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} satisfy |overrightarrow{a}|=1 and |overrightarrow{b}-2overrightarrow{a}|=1.

However, vectors do not have a \\"greater than\\" or \\"less than\\" relationship based on their magnitudes alone, especially when considering direction. This proposition is fundamentally incorrect because vectors are compared based on magnitude and direction, not in a numerical \\"greater than\\" or \\"less than\\" sense.Option B: Given overrightarrow{a}=(1,2), overrightarrow{b}=(1,1), and the angle between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{a}+lambdaoverrightarrow{b} is acute, it implies that the dot product of overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{a}+lambdaoverrightarrow{b} should be positive. However, the solution criticizes this proposition by stating when lambda = 0, the angle between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{a}+lambdaoverrightarrow{b} is 0, which does not directly address the correctness of the range of lambda. This explanation is somewhat misleading as the correctness of the range of lambda should be determined by the dot product condition for acute angles, not merely by setting lambda = 0.Option C: For unit vectors overrightarrow{e_1} and overrightarrow{e_2} with an angle of 60^{circ} between them, the proposition involves minimizing the magnitude of |2overrightarrow{e_1}+toverrightarrow{e_2}|. The solution correctly applies the formula for the magnitude of a vector and uses the dot product overrightarrow{e_1}cdotoverrightarrow{e_2} = cos(60^{circ}) = frac{1}{2} to find that |2overrightarrow{e_1}+toverrightarrow{e_2}| = sqrt{(t+1)^{2}+3}. This expression is minimized when t = -1, contradicting the proposition that it is minimized for t = 1. Therefore, this option is incorrect.Option D: The proposition states that in triangle ABC, if ({frac{{overrightarrow{AB}}}{{|overrightarrow{AB}|}}+frac{{overrightarrow{AC}}}{{|overrightarrow{AC}|}}})cdotoverrightarrow{BC}=0, then triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle.

Determine the properties of triangle BOC:   - Since BC is a chord of length r and the radius of the circle is also r, triangle BOC is an isosceles triangle with OB = OC = r.   - Given that BC = r, triangle BOC is actually an equilateral triangle because all sides are equal.   - Therefore, angle BOC = 60^circ.3. Find angle BOA:   - Since A is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, angle BOA is half of angle BOC because the tangents form an angle with the radius that is equal to the angle subtended by the chord at the center.   - Thus, angle BOA = frac{1}{2} times 60^circ = 30^circ.4.

A sequence is an arithmetic sequence if and only if the formula for the sum of its first n terms is a quadratic function of the term number n.If the sequence left{a_{n}right} is an arithmetic sequence, then a_{n}=a_{1}+ (n-1) d=n d+(x, cdots d). When d neq 0, it is a linear function of n. When a=0, it is a zero-degree function of n, i.e., a constant. Conversely, if the general term formula of the sequence left{a_{n}right} is a_{n}=A n+B, then a_{n}-a_{n-1}=(A n+B)- [A(n-1)+B]=A, A is a constant, so the sequence is an arithmetic sequence. When A neq 0, a_{n}=A n+B is a linear function of n, at this time the sequence is an arithmetic sequence with a non-zero common difference. When A=0, a_{n}=A n+B=B is a zero-degree function of n, at this time, the sequence is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of zero, i.e., a constant sequence.From the above, we can conclude that a sequence is an arithmetic sequence if and only if its general term formula is a_{n}=A n+B, where A and B are constants.Next, we study the second proposition. If the sequence left{a_{n}right} is an arithmetic sequence, then the sum of its first n terms isS_{n}=frac{nleft[2 a_{1}+(n-1) dright]}{2}=frac{d}{2} n^{2}+frac{2 a_{1}-d}{2} n .It is in the form of A n^{2}+B n, when d neq 0, it is a quadratic function of n; when d=0, a_{1} neq 0, it is a_{1} n, a linear function of n; when d=0, a_{1}=0, S_{n}=0, it is a zero-degree function of n. Conversely, if the formula for the sum of the first n terms of the sequence left{a_{n}right} is S_{n}=A n^{2}+B n+C, then a_{n}=: S_{n}-S_{n-1} =left(A n^{2}+B n+Cright)-left[A(n-1)^{2}+B(n-1)right. +C]=2 A tilde{n}+(B-hat{A}) quad(n geqslant 2), a_{n}-a_{n-1} =[2 A n+(B-A)]-[2 A(n-1)+(B- A) ]=2 A. From this, we can see that from the second term onwards, this sequence is an arithmetic sequence, a_{1}=S_{1}=A+B+C, a_{1}= 2 A-1+(B-A)=A+B. To make a_{n}=2 A n + (B-A) also apply to a_{1}, we should let C=0. That is, when C= 0, this sequence is an arithmetic sequence from the first term onwards.From this, we can conclude that a sequence is an arithmetic sequence if and only if the sum of its first n terms is S_{n}=A n^{2}+B n (where A and B are constants)."},{"problem":"## Problem StatementCalculate the definite integral:int_{0}^{2 operatorname{arctan} frac{1}{2}} frac{(1-sin x) d x}{cos x(1+cos x)}","solution":"## SolutionWe will use the universal substitution:t=operatorname{tg} frac{x}{2}From which:begin{aligned}& sin x=frac{2 t}{1+t^{2}}, cos x=frac{1-t^{2}}{1+t^{2}}, d x=frac{2 d t}{1+t^{2}} & x=0 Rightarrow t=operatorname{tg} frac{0}{2}=operatorname{tg} 0=0 & x=2 operatorname{arctg} frac{1}{2} Rightarrow t=operatorname{tg} frac{2 operatorname{arctg} frac{1}{2}}{2}=operatorname{tg}left(operatorname{arctg} frac{1}{2}right)=frac{1}{2}end{aligned}Substitute:begin{aligned}& int_{0}^{2 operatorname{arctg} frac{1}{2}} frac{(1-sin x) d x}{cos x(1+cos x)}=int_{0}^{frac{1}{2}} frac{left(1-frac{2 t}{1+t^{2}}right) cdot frac{2 d t}{1+t^{2}}}{frac{1-t^{2}}{1+t^{2}} cdotleft(1+frac{1-t^{2}}{1+t^{2}}right)}=int_{0}^{frac{1}{2}} frac{frac{1+t^{2}-2 t}{1+t^{2}} cdot frac{2 d t}{1+t^{2}}}{frac{1-t^{2}}{1+t^{2}} cdot frac{1+t^{2}+1-t^{2}}{1+t^{2}}}= & =int_{0}^{frac{1}{2}} frac{2(1-t)^{2} d t}{left(1-t^{2}right) cdot 2}=int_{0}^{frac{1}{2}} frac{(1-t) d t}{1+t}=-int_{0}^{frac{1}{2}} frac{t+1-2}{1+t} d t= & =-int_{0}^{frac{1}{2}} d t+2 cdot int_{0}^{frac{1}{2}} frac{1}{1+t} d t=-left.tright|_{0} ^{frac{1}{2}}+2 ln |1+t|_{0}^{frac{1}{2}}= & =-frac{1}{2}+0+2 ln left|1+frac{1}{2}right|-2 ln |1+0|=-frac{1}{2}+0+2 ln frac{3}{2}-0= & =-frac{1}{2}+2 ln frac{3}{2}end{aligned}Source — «http://pluspi.org/wiki/index.php/������������_%D0%9A%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%BE%D0%B2_%D0%98%D0%BD % mathrm{D} 1 % 82 % mathrm{D} 0 % mathrm{~B} % mathrm{D} 0 % mathrm{~B} 3 % mathrm{D} 1 % 80 % mathrm{D} 0 % mathrm{~B} 0 % mathrm{D} 0 % mathrm{BB} % mathrm{D1} % 8 mathrm{~B}+8-20 »Categories: Kuznetsov's Problem Book Integrals Problem 8 | IntegralsUkrainian Banner Network- Last modified: 20:20, 1 May 2009.- Content is available under CC-BY-SA 3.0.Created by GeeTeatoo## Problem Kuznetsov Integrals 8-21## Material from PlusPi"},{"problem":"Solve in the set of real numbers, the system:x(3y^2+1)=y(y^2+3)y(3z^2+1)=z(z^2+3)z(3x^2+1)=x(x^2+3)","solution":"To solve the system of equations in the set of real numbers:[begin{cases}x(3y^2 + 1) = y(y^2 + 3) y(3z^2 + 1) = z(z^2 + 3) z(3x^2 + 1) = x(x^2 + 3)end{cases}]we will analyze each equation and look for possible solutions.1.

Let ( d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4 ) be the smallest four positive divisors of ( n ). We know that ( d_1 = 1 ).2. Given that ( n ) is the sum of the squares of its four smallest factors, we have:   [   n = d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2   ]   Substituting ( d_1 = 1 ), we get:   [   n = 1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2 = 1 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2   ]   Therefore:   [   n - 1 = d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2   ]3. If ( n ) were odd, then ( d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4 ) would all be odd, making ( n ) even, which is a contradiction. Hence, ( n ) must be even, implying ( d_2 = 2 ).4. Substituting ( d_2 = 2 ) into the equation, we get:   [   n - 5 = d_3^2 + d_4^2   ]5. Since ( n ) is even, ( d_3^2 + d_4^2 ) must be odd. This means one of ( d_3 ) and ( d_4 ) is odd while the other is even.Case 1: If ( d_4 ) is even, say ( d_4 = 2m ):- If ( m = 2 ), then ( d_3 ) must be 3, and:  [  n = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30  ]  However, ( d_4 = 4 ) does not divide 30, so ( n = 30 ) is not a solution.- If ( m > 2 ), since ( m ) must be a divisor (as ( 2m ) is a divisor), ( d_3 = m ) and:  [  n = 5 + 5m^2  ]  Since ( m mid n ):  [  m mid 5 + 5m^2 implies m mid 5 implies m = 5  ]  Therefore:  [  n = 5 + 5 cdot 5^2 = 5 + 125 = 130  ]  We need to check if 130 satisfies the problem's conditions. The divisors of 130 are 1, 2, 5, 10, 13, 26, 65, and 130. The smallest four divisors are 1, 2, 5, and 10. We check:  [  1^2 + 2^2 + 5^2 + 10^2 = 1 + 4 + 25 + 100 = 130  ]  Thus, ( n = 130 ) satisfies the conditions.Case 2: If ( d_3 ) is even, and there were some ( m geq 3 ) such that ( d_3 = 2m ):- Then ( m ) would be a divisor between ( d_2 ) and ( d_3 ), which is a contradiction. So ( m leq 2 ).- Since ( m = 1 ) yields ( d_3 = 2 ), which is absurd, ( m = 2 ) and ( d_3 = 4 ). Hence, if we say ( d_4 = k ):  [  n = 1^2 + 2^2 + 4^2 + k^2 = 1 + 4 + 16 + k^2 = 21 + k^2  ]  From ( k mid n ), we get ( k mid 21 ), so ( k = 7 ).

Identify Points and Midpoints:   - Let O(0,0), A(0,4), and B(3,3).   - The midpoint of segment OA is at (0,2), so the perpendicular bisector of OA will be horizontal and pass through this midpoint, which gives us y=2.   - The midpoint of segment OB is at left(frac{3}{2}, frac{3}{2}right). Since the slope of OB is frac{3-0}{3-0} = 1, the slope of the perpendicular bisector of OB will be -1 (perpendicular slopes are negative reciprocals).2.

Determine the number of positive integers a leq 50 for which there are exactly 6 pairs of positive integers (m, n) with X+Y=45^{circ}.(Note: The formula tan (X+Y)=frac{tan X+tan Y}{1-tan X tan Y} may be useful.)## PART BFor each question in Part B, your solution must be well organized and contain words of explanation or justification. Marks are awarded for completeness, clarity, and style of presentation. A correct solution, poorly presented, will not earn full marks.","solution":"Since X+Y=45^{circ}, then tan (X+Y)=tan 45^{circ}=1.Now, tan (X+Y)=frac{tan X+tan Y}{1-tan X tan Y}=frac{frac{1}{m}+frac{a}{n}}{1-frac{1}{m} cdot frac{a}{n}}=frac{m nleft(frac{1}{m}+frac{a}{n}right)}{m nleft(1-frac{1}{m} cdot frac{a}{n}right)}=frac{n+a m}{m n-a}.Thus, we have frac{n+a m}{m n-a}=1.We want to determine the number of positive integers a for which this equation has exactly 6 pairs of positive integers (m, n) that are solutions.Re-arranging the equation, we obtainbegin{aligned}frac{n+a m}{m n-a} & =1 n+a m & =m n-a a & =m n-a m-n a+a & =m n-a m-n+a 2 a & =m(n-a)-(n-a) 2 a & =(m-1)(n-a)end{aligned}So we want to determine the number of positive integers a for which (m-1)(n-a)=2 a has exactly 6 pairs of positive integers (m, n) that are solutions.Since a neq 0, then m-1 neq 0 and so m neq 1.Since m is a positive integer and m neq 1, then m geq 2; in other words, m-1>0.Since m-1>0 and 2 a>0 and 2 a=(m-1)(n-a), then n-a>0 or n>a.Now, the factorizations of 2 a as a product of two positive integers correspond with the pairs (m, n) of positive integers that are solutions to (m-1)(n-a)=2 a.This is because a factorization 2 a=r cdot s gives a solution m-1=r( or m=r+1) and n-a=s (or n=s+a ) and vice-versa.So the problem is equivalent to determining the number of positive integers a with a leq 50 for which 2 a has three factorizations as a product of two positive integers, or equivalently for which 2 a has six positive divisors.Given an integer d and its prime factorization d=p_{1}^{c_{1}} p_{2}^{c_{2}} cdots p_{k}^{c_{k}}, where p_{1}, p_{2}, ldots, p_{k} are distinct prime numbers and c_{1}, c_{2}, ldots, c_{k} are positive integers, the number of positive divisors of d is left(c_{1}+1right)left(c_{2}+1right) cdotsleft(c_{k}+1right).In order for this product to equal 6, d must have the form p^{5} for some prime number p or p^{2} q for some prime numbers p and q. This is because the only way for 6 to be written as the product of two integers each larger than one is 2 cdot 3.In other words, we want 2 a to be the fifth power of a prime, or the square of a prime times another prime.If 2 a is of the form p^{5}, then p=2 since 2 a is already divisible by 2 . Thus, 2 a=2^{5}=32 and so a=16.If 2 a is of the form p^{2} q, then p=2 or q=2 since 2 a is already divisible by 2 .If p=2, then 2 a=4 q. Since a leq 50, then 2 a leq 100 or q leq 25, and so q can equal 3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23, giving a=6,10,14,22,26,34,38,46. (Note that q neq 2.)If q=2, then 2 a=2 p^{2}. Since 2 a leq 100, then p^{2} leq 50 and so the prime p can equal 3,5,7 giving a=9,25,49. (Note that p neq 2.)Therefore, in summary, there are 12 such values of a.## Part B"},{"problem":"Each term of a sequence of positive integers is obtained from the previous term by adding to it its largest digit. What is the maximal number of successive odd terms in such a sequence?","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   Each term of a sequence of positive integers is obtained from the previous term by adding to it its largest digit. We need to determine the maximal number of successive odd terms in such a sequence.2. Initial Observations:   - If a number is odd, its largest digit must be added to it to form the next term.   - For the next term to remain odd, the largest digit added must be even.   - The largest digit of an odd number cannot be 0 (since the number is positive and odd).3. Case Analysis:   - Max digit is 2:     - If the last digit is 1, the next number ends with (1 + 2 = 3). The new max digit is 3, and the next number will be even. Thus, we get two successive odd numbers.   - Max digit is 4:     - If the last digit is 1, the next number ends with (1 + 4 = 5). The new max digit is 5, and the next number will be even. Thus, we get two successive odd numbers.     - If the last digit is 3, the next number ends with (3 + 4 = 7). The new max digit is 7, and the next number will be even. Thus, we get two successive odd numbers.   - Max digit is 6:     - If the last digit is 1, the next number ends with (1 + 6 = 7). The new max digit is 7, and the next number will be even. Thus, we get two successive odd numbers.     - If the last digit is 3, the next number ends with (3 + 6 = 9). The new max digit is 9, and the next number will be even. Thus, we get two successive odd numbers.     - If the last digit is 5, the next number ends with (5 + 6 = 11). The new max digit is 1, and the next number will be odd. Thus, we get three successive odd numbers.   - Max digit is 8:     - If the last digit is 1, the next number ends with (1 + 8 = 9). The new max digit is 9, and the next number will be even. Thus, we get two successive odd numbers.     - If the last digit is 3, the next number ends with (3 + 8 = 11). The new max digit is 1, and the next number will be odd. Thus, we get three successive odd numbers.     - If the last digit is 5, the next number ends with (5 + 8 = 13). The new max digit is 3, and the next number will be odd. Thus, we get four successive odd numbers.     - If the last digit is 7, the next number ends with (7 + 8 = 15). The new max digit is 5, and the next number will be odd. Thus, we get five successive odd numbers.4. Conclusion:   - The maximum number of successive odd terms in such a sequence is 5. This can be achieved with the sequence (807, 815, 823, 831, 839).The final answer is (boxed{5})."},{"problem":"From a triangle, three triangles were cut off, and each of the three cuts touched the inscribed circle of the triangle.

In the described hexagon, formed after cutting off the triangles, the three sides along which the cuts are made are composed of six segments of different colors. The remaining three sides are also composed of six segments of different colors. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the three cuts is equal to the sum of the three segments of the perimeter of the original triangle, not belonging to the cut-off triangles. From this, it is easy to see that the perimeter of the original triangle is equal to the sum of the perimeters of the cut-off triangles.## OtvetP_{1}+P_{2}+P_{3}"},{"problem":"Given a line x+y=m (m>0) intersecting a circle x^2+y^2=1 at points P and Q, and angle POQ=120^circ (where O is the origin), find the value of m.","solution":"From the problem statement, we know that the distance d from the center of the circle to the line equals OP cdot sin(30^circ), because ∠POQ is 120°, it forms two 30° angles at P and O (when we draw a radius from the circle center to meet at a 90° angle with the line).As sin(30^circ) = frac{1}{2}, we obtain:d = OP cdot sin(30^circ) = frac {1}{2}Now, calculating the distance from the center O (0,0) to the line x+y=m using the point-to-line distance formula gives us:d = frac{|Ax+By+C|}{sqrt{A^2+B^2}}For the line x+y = m, we have A=1, B=1, text{and} C=-m, thus:d = frac{|1cdot0+1cdot0-m|}{sqrt{1^2+1^2}} = frac{|-m|}{sqrt{2}} = frac{m}{sqrt{2}}By equating the two expressions for d, we get:frac{m}{sqrt{2}} = frac{1}{2} Rightarrow m = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}Since m>0, the only positive solution for m is: boxed{m = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}} Therefore, the correct answer is B.

What is the answer to this problem?","solution":"To solve the problem of finding the maximum number of points where at least two of the twelve circles intersect, we need to consider the number of intersection points formed by pairs of circles.1. Understanding Circle Intersections:   - When two distinct circles intersect, they can intersect at most in 2 points.   - Therefore, for each pair of circles, there are at most 2 intersection points.2. Counting Pairs of Circles:   - We need to determine the number of ways to choose 2 circles out of 12. This is a combination problem.   - The number of ways to choose 2 circles from 12 is given by the binomial coefficient:     [     binom{12}{2} = frac{12!}{2!(12-2)!} = frac{12 times 11}{2 times 1} = 66     ]3. Calculating Total Intersection Points:   - Since each pair of circles can intersect at most in 2 points, the total number of intersection points is:     [     2 times binom{12}{2} = 2 times 66 = 132     ]Thus, the maximum number of points where at least two of the twelve circles intersect is ( boxed{132} )."},{"problem":"Example 11 (2004 China Mathematical Olympiad) In a convex quadrilateral E F G H, the vertices E, F, G, H are on the sides A B, B C, C D, D A of another convex quadrilateral A B C D, respectively, satisfying: frac{A E}{E B} cdot frac{B F}{F C} cdot frac{C G}{G D} cdot frac{D H}{H A}=1; and the points A, B, C, D are on the sides H_{1} E_{1}, E_{1} F_{1}, F_{1} G_{1}, G_{1} H_{1} of a convex quadrilateral E_{1} F_{1} G_{1} H_{1}, respectively, satisfying: E_{1} F_{1} parallel E F, F_{1} G_{1} parallel F G, G_{1} H_{1} parallel G H, H_{1} E_{1} parallel H E.

Original Production Rate: The factory originally planned to produce x tons of fertilizer per day. This means that to produce 120 tons, it would take frac{120}{x} days.2. Increased Production Rate: With the adoption of new technology, the factory's daily production increased by 3 tons, making it x + 3 tons per day. Therefore, to produce 180 tons at this new rate, it would take frac{180}{x + 3} days.3. Equal Time for Different Quantities: The problem states that the time taken to produce 120 tons at the original rate is the same as the time taken to produce 180 tons at the increased rate.

We need to transform this equation into the form (y_1^2 = x_1^3 - 36x_1) using the linear transformations (x_1 = ax + b) and (y_1 = cy + d).2. First, let's rewrite the given equation in a factored form:   [   6y^2 = 2x^3 + 3x^2 + x = x(2x^2 + 3x + 1)   ]   Notice that (2x^2 + 3x + 1) can be factored as:   [   2x^2 + 3x + 1 = (2x + 1)(x + 1)   ]   Therefore, the equation becomes:   [   6y^2 = x(2x + 1)(x + 1)   ]3. Now, we need to find the appropriate linear transformations for (x) and (y) such that the transformed equation matches (y_1^2 = x_1^3 - 36x_1).
