All N such that t^{2} leq N<t^{2}+t for some positive integer t.ब Solution 1 (local). If t^{2} leq N<t^{2}+t then the sequence s_{n}=t n+1 satisfies both conditions. It remains to show that no other values of N work.Define a_{n}:=s_{n}-s_{n-1}, and let p be the minimal period of left{a_{n}right}. For each k in mathbb{Z}_{geq 0}, let f(k) be the integer such thats_{f(k)}-s_{k} leq N<s_{f(k)+1}-s_{k} .Note that fleft(s_{n-1}right)=s_{n} for all n. Since left{a_{n}right} is periodic with period p, f(k+p)=f(k)+p for all k, so k mapsto f(k)-k is periodic with period p. We also note that f is nondecreasing: if k<k^{prime} but fleft(k^{prime}right)<f(k) thenN<s_{fleft(k^{prime}right)+1}-s_{k^{prime}}<s_{f(k)}-s_{k} leq N,which is absurd. We now claim thatmax _{k}(f(k)-k)<p+min _{k}(f(k)-k) .Indeed, if fleft(k^{prime}right)-k^{prime} geq p+f(k)-k then we can shift k and k^{prime} so that 0 leq k-k^{prime}<p, and it follows that k leq k^{prime} leq fleft(k^{prime}right)<f(k), violating the fact that f is nondecreasing. Therefore max _{k}(f(k)-k)<p+min _{k}(f(k)-k), so f(k)-k is uniquely determined by its value modulo p. In particular, since a_{n}=fleft(s_{n-1}right)-s_{n-1}, a_{n} is also uniquely determined by its value modulo p, so left{a_{n} bmod pright} also has minimal period p.Now work in mathbb{Z} / p mathbb{Z} and consider the sequence s_{0}, fleft(s_{0}right), fleft(fleft(s_{0}right)right), ldots. This sequence must be eventually periodic; suppose it has minimal period p^{prime}, which must be at most p. Then, sincef^{n}left(s_{0}right)-f^{n-1}left(s_{0}right)=s_{n}-s_{n-1}=a_{n},and left{a_{n} bmod pright} has minimal period p, we must have p^{prime}=p. Therefore the directed graph G on mathbb{Z} / p mathbb{Z} given by the edges k rightarrow f(k) is simply a p-cycle, which implies that the map k mapsto f(k) is a bijection on mathbb{Z} / p mathbb{Z}. Therefore, f(k+1) neq f(k) for all k (unless p=1, but in this case the following holds anyways), hencef(k)<f(k+1)<cdots<f(k+p)=f(k)+p .This implies f(k+1)=f(k)+1 for all k, so f(k)-k is constant, therefore a_{n}= fleft(s_{n-1}right)-s_{n-1} is also constant. Let a_{n} equiv t. It follows that t^{2} leq N<t^{2}+t as we wanted.『 Solution 2 (global). Define left{a_{n}right} and f as in the previous solution. We first show that s_{i} not equiv s_{j}(bmod p) for all i<j<i+p. Suppose the contrary, i.e. that s_{i} equiv s_{j} (bmod p) for some i, j with i<j<i+p. Then a_{s_{i}+k}=a_{s_{j}+k} for all k geq 0, therefore s_{s_{i}+k}-s_{s_{i}}=s_{s_{j}+k}-s_{s_{j}} for all k geq 0, thereforea_{i+1}=fleft(s_{i}right)-s_{i}=fleft(s_{j}right)-s_{j}=a_{j+1} quad text { and } quad s_{i+1}=fleft(s_{i}right) equiv fleft(s_{j}right)=s_{j+1} quad(bmod p) .Continuing this inductively, we obtain a_{i+k}=a_{j+k} for all k, so left{a_{n}right} has period j-i<p, which is a contradiction. Therefore s_{i} not equiv s_{j}(bmod p) for all i<j<i+p, and this implies that left{s_{i}, ldots, s_{i+p-1}right} forms a complete residue system modulo p for all i. Consequently we must have s_{i+p} equiv s_{i}(bmod p) for all i.Let T=s_{p}-s_{0}=a_{1}+cdots+a_{p}. Since left{a_{n}right} is periodic with period p, and {i+1, ldots, i+k p} contains exactly k values of each residue class modulo p,s_{i+k p}-s_{i}=a_{i+1}+cdots+a_{i+k p}=k Tfor all i, k. Since p mid T, it follows that s_{s_{p}}-s_{s_{0}}=frac{T}{p} cdot T=frac{T^{2}}{p}. Summing up the inequalitiess_{s_{n}}-s_{s_{n-1}} leq N<s_{s_{n}+1}-s_{s_{n-1}}=s_{s_{n}}-s_{s_{n-1}}+a_{s_{n}+1}for n in{1, ldots, p} then impliesfrac{T^{2}}{p}=s_{s_{p}}-s_{s_{0}} leq N p<frac{T^{2}}{p}+a_{s_{1}+1}+a_{s_{2}+1}+cdots+a_{s_{p}+1}=frac{T^{2}}{p}+T,where the last equality holds because left{s_{1}+1, ldots, s_{p}+1right} is a complete residue system modulo p. Dividing this by p yields t^{2} leq N<t^{2}+t for t:=frac{T}{p} in mathbb{Z}^{+}.Remark (Author comments). There are some similarities between this problem and IMO 2009/3, mainly that they both involve terms of the form s_{s_{n}} and s_{s_{n}+1} and the sequence s_{0}, s_{1}, ldots turns out to be an arithmetic progression. Other than this, I don't think knowing about IMO 2009/3 will be that useful on this problem, since in this problem the fact that left{s_{n+1}-s_{n}right} is periodic is fundamentally important.The motivation for this problem comes from the following scenario: assume we have boxes that can hold some things of total size leq N, and a sequence of things of size a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots (where a_{i}:=s_{i+1}-s_{i} ). We then greedily pack the things in a sequence of boxes, 'closing' each box when it cannot fit the next thing. The number of things we put in each box gives a sequence b_{1}, b_{2}, ldots. This problem asks when we can have left{a_{n}right}=left{b_{n}right}, assuming that we start with a sequence left{a_{n}right} that is periodic.(Extra motivation: I first thought about this scenario when I was pasting some text repeatedly into the Notes app and noticed that the word at the end of lines are also (eventually) periodic.)"},{"problem":"Given proposition p: The line 6x+2y-1=0 is parallel to the line y=5-3x; proposition q: The line 6x+2y-1=0 is perpendicular to the line 2x+6y-4=0, which of the following statements is correct (quad)?A: p vee q is a false propositionB: (neg p) wedge q is a false propositionC: p wedge q is a true propositionD: (neg p) vee q is a true proposition","solution":"AnalysisThis question examines the truth of propositions and the determination of the truth of compound propositions formed by simple logical connectives.

Applying AM-GM to each term:   For each term, we can write:   [   frac{de}{a(b+1)} geq frac{2sqrt{de cdot a(b+1)}}{a(b+1)} = frac{2sqrt{dea(b+1)}}{a(b+1)}   ]   Since (abcde = 1), we have (de = frac{1}{abc}). Substituting this in, we get:   [   frac{2sqrt{frac{1}{abc} cdot a(b+1)}}{a(b+1)} = frac{2sqrt{frac{b+1}{bc}}}{a(b+1)} = frac{2sqrt{frac{b+1}{b}}}{a(b+1)} = frac{2sqrt{frac{1}{b} + 1}}{a(b+1)}   ]   This approach seems complex, so let's consider a simpler application of AM-GM directly to the sum.4.

Final simplification:   Since the product inside the root is 1, we have:   [   5 sqrt[5]{1} = 5 cdot 1 = 5   ]   Therefore:   [   frac{de}{a(b+1)} + frac{ea}{b(c+1)} + frac{ab}{c(d+1)} + frac{bc}{d(e+1)} + frac{cd}{e(a+1)} geq 5 cdot 1 = 5   ]   This is incorrect, as we need to show (geq frac{5}{2}). We need to re-evaluate the application of AM-GM.7.

Calculation of r:   - Using the given values r_A = 16, r_B = 25, and r_C = 36, we calculate:     [     r = sqrt{r_A r_B} + sqrt{r_B r_C} + sqrt{r_C r_A}     ]   - Substituting the values:     [     r = sqrt{16 cdot 25} + sqrt{25 cdot 36} + sqrt{36 cdot 16}     ]   - Simplifying each term:     [     r = sqrt{400} + sqrt{900} + sqrt{576}     ]     [     r = 20 + 30 + 24     ]   - Adding these values:     [     r = 74     ]The final answer is boxed{74}"},{"problem":"Find the standard equation of the parabola with the origin as the vertex, the coordinate axes as the axes of symmetry, and passing through point P(-4, -2).","solution":"According to the problem, the parabola passes through point P(-4, -2).

This is equal to sum_{l=0}^{n-1} binom{n-1}{l}^2. This is a simplification of Vandermonde's identity, which states that sum_{k=0}^{r} binom{m}{k} cdot binom{n}{r-k} = binom{m+n}{r}.

We have cards with numbers 5, 6, 7, ..., 55 (each card has one number). What is the maximum number of cards we can select so that the sum of the numbers on any two selected cards is not a palindrome? (A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward.)","solution":"SOLUTION. To be able to express ourselves more concisely, we will choose numbers directly, not cards.First, note that for the sum s of any two given numbers, 11= =5+6 leqq s leqq 55+54=109. Among the numbers from 11 to 109, the palindromes are precisely all multiples of 11 and the number 101. Now, realize that the divisibility of the sum of two numbers by a given number d (in our case, d=11) depends only on the remainders of the two addends when divided by the given d. This useful rule will be applied by dividing all the given numbers from 5 to 55 into groups according to their remainders when divided by 11, and writing these groups into rows so that the sum of two numbers from different groups on the same row is divisible by 11; we will explain the meaning of the parentheses at the end of each row shortly.[]At the end of each row, we have added the maximum number of numbers that can be selected from that row without the sum of any two of them being a multiple of 11. For example, in the third row, we have a quintet of numbers with a remainder of 8 and a quartet of numbers with a remainder of 3. It is clear that we cannot simultaneously select one number from each of these groups (their sum would be a multiple of 11), but we can simultaneously select all five numbers from the quintet (the sum of any two of them will give the same remainder as the sum 8+8, i.e., a remainder of 5). Let us add that the scheme of six rows has another huge advantage for us: the sum of any two numbers from different rows is not a multiple of 11 (neither is the sum of their two remainders).From the given division of all the given numbers into six rows, it follows that we cannot select more than 5 cdot 5+1=26 numbers in the required way. However, if we selected 26 numbers, there would have to be one of the numbers 49 or 50 mathrm{a} and from the other four rows, one number each from 51, 52, 53, and 54 - then we would get the palindrome 49+52 or 50+51. Therefore, it is not possible to select more than 25 numbers, and a selection of 25 numbers is possible: on the first five rows, we can select, for example, all the numbers from the left groups except for the number 52 and one number (e.g., 11) from the last row. Then the sum of any two selected numbers will not be divisible by 11 (thanks to the grouping of numbers), let alone equal to the last \\"critical\\" number, the palindrome 101 (which is why we excluded 52 when choosing 49).Answer.

Petya started buying books (each book costs an integer number of rubles) and receiving change in small denominations (1-ruble coins). When buying an expensive book (not cheaper than 100 rubles), Petya paid only with hundred-ruble bills (the minimum necessary number of them), and when buying a cheap book (cheaper than 100 rubles), he paid with small denominations if he had enough, and if not, with a hundred-ruble bill. By the time the hundred-ruble bills ran out, Petya had spent exactly half of his money on books. Could Petya have spent at least 5000 rubles on books?(Tatyana Kazitsyna)","solution":"Solution 1. Let's see how much small change Petya could have received.Consider the very last cheap purchase that increased the amount of small change. Let the cost of this purchase be x, then before this, there was no more than x-1 rubles of small change, and thus, after this, it would become no more than x-1+100-x=99 rubles. Since expensive purchases do not reduce the amount of small change, all previous purchases together with the considered one gave a total of no more than 99 rubles of small change. Therefore, all cheap purchases together brought no more than 99 rubles.Let there be n purchases more expensive than 100 rubles. Each of them adds no more than 99 rubles of small change. If there were no other purchases at all, then the amount spent on expensive purchases would be no less than 2n hundreds, and the change would be no more than 99n - less than half of what was spent. Therefore, there are other purchases. But then Petya had no less than 2n+1 hundred-ruble bills, and the small change at the end became no more than 99n+99. Thus, (2n+1)50 leq 99n+99, from which n leq 49. Therefore, the small change will not exceed 99 cdot 49 + 99 < 5000 rubles. This means that less than 5000 rubles were spent.Solution 2. Suppose some item was bought for x rubles of small change. This small change appeared as change from previous purchases. Increase the cost of these purchases by the corresponding amounts, totaling x rubles, and cancel the current purchase. Similarly, get rid of all purchases made with small change. On each step, the amount of small change decreases, so no new purchases with small change will appear.There is a purchase costing no more than 50 rubles (small), otherwise less than half of all the money would remain. There is only one small purchase, as a second small purchase would have been made with the change from the first, and there are no more purchases with small change now.The difference between the change for the small purchase and its price is no more than 99-1=98 rubles. For each other purchase, this difference is negative and even (since the sum of the price and the change is a multiple of 100, i.e., even). Therefore, this difference is no less than -98 and no more than -2. Thus, there are no more than 98:2=49 other purchases, and for each of them, no more than two hundred-ruble bills were given (otherwise, the specified difference would be no more than 99-201<-98). Therefore, the total number of hundred-ruble bills was no more than 1+2 cdot 49=99, and half of this sum is no more than 9900:2=4950<5000."},{"problem":"5. Given the number 800 ldots 008 (80 zeros).

For investigating divisibility by 11, it is significant on which positions the replaceable digits stand.First case. We replace two zeros in positions of the same parity (both even or both odd). For divisibility by 11, the sum of the two new digits must be divisible by 11, and since each digit is within the range [1 ; 9], the sum must be 11. Note that divisibility by 9 is automatically satisfied in this case (the sum of the digits of the number is 16+11=27). The following pairs of digits fit: 2--9,3--8,4--7, 5--6. Let's count the number of ways to perform the replacement. First, we choose one of these four pairs of digits (4 ways), then place the smaller digit in the position of any of the zeros (80 ways); finally, place the larger digit in the same parity position (39 ways) - in total, we get 4 cdot 80 cdot 39=12480 ways.Second case. We replace two zeros in positions of different parity. Then, for divisibility by 11, these digits must be the same (denote each by k), and for divisibility by 9, 16+2 k: 9 must hold. This condition is satisfied only by k=1.

To encourage the early purchase of tickets, the directors of the Union decided that:- the tickets will be numbered starting from number 1 and sold in ascending order of their numbering;- at the end of the party, each participant will receive R0.01 for each ticket sold that has a number greater than the number of their ticket.a) If 100 tickets are sold, how much will the person who bought the ticket with number 1 receive at the end of the party? And the one who bought the ticket with number 70?b) What will be the profit of the Union if 100 tickets are sold?c) How many tickets should the Union sell to achieve the maximum possible profit?","solution":"Solutiona) After the sale of ticket number 1, 100-1 = 99 tickets were sold. Therefore, the person who bought the first ticket will receive 99 times 0.01 = 0.99 reais. Similarly, after the sale of ticket number 70, 100-70=30 tickets were sold, so the person who bought this ticket will receive 30 times 0.01 = 0.30 reais.b) 1st solution: The value of selling 100 tickets is R600.00. The Grêmio will have to return R0.01 to the person who bought the 99th ticket, 2 cents to the person who bought the 98th ticket, and so on, up to R0.99 to the person who bought the 1st ticket. In total, the Grêmio will have to return, in reais,frac{1}{100} + frac{2}{100} + frac{3}{100} + cdots + frac{99}{100} = frac{1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + 99}{100} = frac{frac{99 times 100}{2}}{100} = 49.50and the total profit will be R600.00 - R49.50 = R550.50.Observation: We notice that this solution is based on the idea used to prove the well-known formula for the sum of consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression.2nd solution: With tickets numbered 1 and 100, the Grêmio has a profit, in reais, of(6 - 99 times 0.01) + (6 - 0 times 0.01) = 11.01With tickets numbered 2 and 99, the profit will also be(6 - 98 times 0.01) + (6 - 1 times 0.01) = 11.01Applying the same argument to the pairs of tickets numbered 3 and 98, 4 and 97, ..., 50 and 51, we get a total of 50 pairs, each giving the Grêmio a profit of R11.01. Therefore, the Grêmio's profit will be 50 times R11.01 = R550.50.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_01_c051a4aaadd76ab6970bg-20.jpg?height=45&width=1528&top_left_y=1551&top_left_x=338)frac{1}{100} + frac{2}{100} + frac{3}{100} + cdots + frac{x-1}{100} = frac{1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + (x-1)}{100} = frac{frac{(x-1) x}{2}}{100} = frac{x^2 - x}{200}Thus, denoting by ( L(x) ) the profit of the Grêmio from selling ( x ) tickets, we have:L(x) = 6x - frac{x^2 - x}{200} = frac{1201x - x^2}{200} = frac{x(1201 - x)}{200}The graph of ( L(x) ) is a parabola, and the maximum value of ( L(x) ) occurs when ( x = 600.5 ). To see this, it is not necessary to use the formula for the maximum or minimum points; it is enough to observe the symmetry of the graph of this parabola, drawn below:![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_01_c051a4aaadd76ab6970bg-20.jpg?height=552&width=662&top_left_y=2094&top_left_x=797)Since the number of tickets is an integer, the maximum profit of the Grêmio will be achieved when 600 or 601 tickets are sold. Since these points are symmetric with respect to 600.5, the profit will be the same in either case. This profit is ( L(600) = frac{600(1201 - 600)}{200} = 1803 ) reais. 2nd solution: We can think that the buyer of ticket number ( n ) pays the Grêmio R6.00, and that from this amount, the Grêmio will withdraw R0.01 for each of the previous buyers. Thus, denoting by ( f(n) ) the profit (in reais) of the Grêmio from ticket number ( n ), we have:f(n) = 6 - (n-1) times 0.01 = 6.01 - 0.01 times nIt follows that the profit of the Grêmio per ticket decreases by R0.01 for each ticket sold (i.e., the function ( f ) is decreasing). Since the profit of the Grêmio from ticket number 601 is ( f(601) = 6 - (601-1) times 0.01 = 0 ) reais and the function ( f ) is decreasing, we see that the profit of the Grêmio is positive for all tickets numbered less than 601, and negative for all tickets numbered greater than 601. Therefore, the total profit of the Grêmio will be the highest possible when 600 (or 601) tickets are sold, as only after the sale of ticket number 601 will the Grêmio start to incur losses (i.e., negative profit) with each additional ticket sold.3rd solution: The buyer of the last ticket does not receive anything back, that is, the Grêmio will profit R6.00 from his ticket; the buyer of the second-to-last ticket receives R0.01 back, so the Grêmio will profit R5.99 from his ticket. Thus, the total profit of the Grêmio (in reais) from the sale of the tickets is6.00 + 5.99 + 5.98 + cdots + (text{profit from ticket number } 1)and it follows that this total profit increases with the addition of new buyers as long as the profit from ticket number 1 is positive.The profit from ticket number 1 is ( 6 - (x-1) times 0.01 ) reais, where ( x ) is the number of tickets sold. The equation ( 6 - (x-1) times 0.01 = 0 ) has the root ( x = 601 ), so the profit from ticket number 1 is positive if ( x < 601 ). Therefore, the maximum profit will be achieved when the Grêmio sells 600 tickets (or 601, since ticket number 601 yields a profit of 0 reais)."},{"problem":"6.

Since e^x is monotonically increasing for all x, and -frac{1}{x} is also monotonically increasing in the interval (frac{2}{3},1) (since the denominator gets smaller as x increases, making the negative fraction less negative), it follows that f(x) is monotonically increasing in this interval.

Initial Setup: We start with a square paper (FOLD) with side length (2). The center of the square is the midpoint of both diagonals, which we will call (C).2.

Another method for finding this sum is given in the solution to problem 55.","solution":"71. a) At the moment when a person discovers that the matchbox taken out of the pocket is empty, the second box can contain 0 matches (i.e., be also empty), 1 match, 2 matches, 3 matches, and so on up to ( n ) matches inclusive. The considered experiment consists of the person repeatedly drawing one match at random from the first or the second box until one of the boxes is empty. In different outcomes of the experiment, the total number of matches drawn will naturally be different; therefore, different outcomes will not be equally probable and cannot be used to calculate probabilities. This difficulty can be overcome by a method similar to the one we used above in solving problem 65: we will assume that when the drawn box turns out to be empty, the person refills it (practically, this can be achieved, for example, by replacing the empty box with a new full one) and continues to draw matches at random from one or the other box. We agree to consider that this sequential drawing of matches stops after the ((2n+1))-th match is drawn; since initially there were a total of (2n) matches in both boxes, it is clear that by this moment at least one of the boxes will be found empty (and will be refilled again). Now we can rephrase the given problem as follows: a certain person draws a match from one of two boxes (2n+1) times in a row, with each time the probability of drawing a match from one or the other box being the same. The number of matches in each box can be considered unlimited (since we agreed to refill an empty box again). At some point, the person draws the ((n+1))-th match from one of the boxes (in the original formulation, this would mean that he found the box empty); what is the probability that by this moment (n-k) matches have been drawn from the second box?In the new formulation, the problem is solved quite simply. Each separate draw can, obviously, have two outcomes (a match can be drawn from the first or the second box); (2n+1) sequential draws can have (2^{2n+1}) different outcomes. This is the total number of equally probable outcomes of the considered experiment. Favorable outcomes are those in which out of the first (2n-k) draws, (n) matches are drawn from the first box and (n-k) from the second, and the ((2n-k+1))-th match is again drawn from the first box, or, conversely, out of the first (2n-k) draws, (n) are made from the second box, (n-k) from the first, and the ((2n-k+1))-th draw is also from the second; the results of the last (k) draws can be anything. But the number of outcomes of (2n-k) draws in which (n) matches are drawn from the first box and (n-k) from the second is equal to the number of combinations (C_{2n-k}^{n}) of (2n-k) elements taken (n) at a time. Combining these outcomes with the (2^k) possible outcomes of the last (k) trials, we find that the number of outcomes in which (n+1) matches are first drawn from the first box, and by this moment (n-k) matches have been drawn from the second box, is (C_{2n-k}^{n} cdot 2^k). Exactly the same number of outcomes will be those in which the ((n+1))-th match is first drawn from the second box, and by this moment (n-k) matches have been drawn from the first box. Thus, the total number of favorable outcomes of the experiment here is (2 C_{2n-k}^{n} cdot 2^k = 2^{k+1} C_{2n-k}^{n}).

We will paint the entire board in a checkerboard pattern so that the central cell of the board is black.

Consider an arbitrary black cell A that can be reached in fewer than 10 moves from the center. Since by the time the chip reaches cell A, an even number of moves, less than 10, has been made, one can simply move the chip to an adjacent cell and back until exactly 10 moves have been made. Therefore, we need to count the number of black cells that can be reached in no more than 10 moves.In 0 moves, you can only reach the starting cell, in 2 moves you can reach the starting cell and 4 cdot 2=8 new cells, in 4 moves you can reach the cells that have already been reached and 4 cdot 4=16 new cells, and so on.

Hence, left{a_{n+1}-alpha a_{n}right} and left{a_{n+1}-beta a_{n}right} are geometric sequences with common ratios beta and alpha respectively. So, a_{n+1}-alpha a_{n}=beta^{n-1}(1-alpha cdot 1)= beta^{n}. Similarly, a_{n+1}-beta a_{n}=alpha^{n}.

Find m+n.","solution":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that Club Truncator will finish the season with more wins than losses. Given that the probabilities of winning, losing, or tying any match are each frac{1}{3}, we can use combinatorial methods and symmetry to find the desired probability.1. Define the problem in terms of combinatorics:   - Club Truncator plays 6 matches.   - Let ( W ) be the number of wins, ( L ) be the number of losses, and ( T ) be the number of ties.   - We need to find the probability that ( W > L ).2. Calculate the total number of possible outcomes:   - Each match has 3 possible outcomes (win, lose, tie).   - Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes for 6 matches is ( 3^6 = 729 ).3. Calculate the probability of having an equal number of wins and losses:   - We need to consider cases where ( W = L ).   Case 1: ( W = 3 ) and ( L = 3 )   - The number of ways to arrange 3 wins and 3 losses in 6 matches is given by the binomial coefficient:     [     binom{6}{3} = 20     ]   - Each of these arrangements can have any combination of ties in the remaining matches, but since there are no remaining matches, this is the only arrangement.   Case 2: ( W = 2 ), ( L = 2 ), and ( T = 2 )   - The number of ways to arrange 2 wins, 2 losses, and 2 ties in 6 matches is given by the multinomial coefficient:     [     frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = 90     ]   Case 3: ( W = 1 ), ( L = 1 ), and ( T = 4 )   - The number of ways to arrange 1 win, 1 loss, and 4 ties in 6 matches is given by the multinomial coefficient:     [     frac{6!}{1!1!4!} = 30     ]   Case 4: ( W = 0 ), ( L = 0 ), and ( T = 6 )   - The number of ways to arrange 0 wins, 0 losses, and 6 ties in 6 matches is given by:     [     frac{6!}{0!0!6!} = 1     ]4. Sum the probabilities of these cases:   - The total number of favorable outcomes for ( W = L ) is:     [     20 + 90 + 30 + 1 = 141     ]   - The probability of having an equal number of wins and losses is:     [     frac{141}{729}     ]5. Use symmetry to find the probability of ( W > L ):   - The probabilities of ( W > L ) and ( L > W ) are equal due to symmetry.   - The probability of ( W = L ) is ( frac{141}{729} ).   - Therefore, the probability of ( W neq L ) is:     [     1 - frac{141}{729} = frac{588}{729}     ]   - Since ( W > L ) and ( L > W ) are equally likely, the probability of ( W > L ) is:     [     frac{1}{2} times frac{588}{729} = frac{294}{729} = frac{98}{243}     ]6.

Therefore, the total area of the quadrilateral is twice the area of the grey stripes.3.

Finding the Equation of the Ellipse CGiven that the ellipse C shares common foci with the hyperbola x^{2}-y^{2}=1, we know the hyperbola's focal distance is c=sqrt{2}. For an ellipse, the relationship between a, b, and c is c^2=a^2-b^2. Therefore, we have:[a^2-b^2=2 quad (1)]Since the ellipse passes through the point (1,frac{sqrt{6}}{3}), substituting this point into the ellipse equation gives us:[frac{1}{a^2}+frac{frac{2}{3}}{b^2}=1 quad (2)]Solving equations (1) and (2) together, we find two possible values for a^2: 3 and frac{2}{3}. However, since a>b, we discard a^2=frac{2}{3}, leaving us with a^2=3. Substituting a^2=3 into equation (1), we can solve for b^2 but it's not required for the equation of the ellipse.

However, we need to ensure that ( x + y ) does not divide ( z ) for any ( z ) in ( M ).3. Constructing the Subset ( M ):   Let's consider the largest element in ( M ) to be ( n ). We will analyze the cases when ( n ) is even and when ( n ) is odd.4. Case 1: ( n ) is even:   - Consider the pairs ({1, n-1}, {2, n-2}, ldots, {frac{n}{2}-1, frac{n}{2}+1}, {frac{n}{2}}).   - Each pair ({a, b}) is such that ( a + b = n ). If we take more than one element from any pair, their sum will be ( n ), which is not allowed.   - Therefore, we can take at most one element from each pair.   - The number of such pairs is (frac{n}{2}), and we can take one element from each pair plus the middle element if ( n ) is even.   - Thus, (|M| leq leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor + 1).5. Case 2: ( n ) is odd:   - Consider the pairs ({1, n-1}, {2, n-2}, ldots, left{leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor - 1, leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor + 1right}).   - Similar to the even case, we can take at most one element from each pair.   - The number of such pairs is (leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor), and we can take one element from each pair.   - Thus, (|M| leq leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor + 1).6. Applying to ( n = 2006 ):   - Since ( 2006 ) is even, we have (|M| leq leftlfloor frac{2006}{2} rightrfloor + 1 = 1003 + 1 = 1004).7. Constructing a Valid Subset ( M ) with 1004 Elements:   - Consider the subset ({1003, 1004, ldots, 2006}).   - This subset has 1004 elements.   - For any three elements ( x, y, z ) in this subset, ( x + y ) will be greater than ( z ) because the smallest sum ( 1003 + 1004 = 2007 ) is greater than the largest element 2006.   - Therefore, this subset satisfies the condition.Conclusion:The largest possible size of ( M ) is 1004.The final answer is (boxed{1004})."},{"problem":"18.

Proof:The derivative of g(x) is g'(x) = frac{2a}{x} - frac{2 ln{x}}{x} = frac{2(a - ln{x})}{x}.Thus, g(x) is an increasing function in (0, e^a) and a decreasing function in (e^a, +infty).The derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = 2e^{2x} - 2ae^{x} = 2e^{x}(e^{x} - a).When a leq 0, f'(x) > 0 always holds, so f(x) is monotonically increasing on mathbb{R}, and the proposition is true.When a > 0, f(x) is a decreasing function in (-infty, ln{a}) and an increasing function in (ln{a}, +infty).Let h(x) = ln{x} - x, then h'(x) = frac{1 - x}{x} = 0, which gives x = 1.h(x) is a decreasing function in (1, +infty) and an increasing function in (0, 1), and h(1) = -1  x and e^{a} > ln{a}, so the functions f(x) and g(x) also have the same increasing interval.In conclusion, the proposition is true.2.

Since e^{x} > ln{x} from part 1, we have e^{x} - ln{x} > frac{k}{2} always holds.Let t(x) = e^{x} - ln{x}, then t'(x) = e^{x} - frac{1}{x}. t'(x) is monotonically increasing, and since t'(frac{1}{2}) = sqrt{e} - 2  0, there exists a unique zero point x_0 of t'(x) in (0, +infty), and x_0 in (frac{1}{2}, frac{2}{3}).When x in (0, x_0), t(x) is a decreasing function, and when x in (x_0, +infty), t(x) is an increasing function.Thus, the minimum value of t(x) is t(x_0) = e^{x_0} - ln{x_0} = frac{1}{x_0} + x_0, and since x_0 in (frac{1}{2}, frac{2}{3}), we have t(x_0) in (frac{13}{6}, frac{5}{2}).Since t(x_0) > frac{k}{2} and k is a positive integer, we have k leq 4, so the maximum value of k is boxed{4}."},{"problem":"Two wooden sticks have lengths of 5 and 7, respectively.

Hence, f(x)-x=x^{2}-3 x+2=(x-2)(x-1). Therefore, the roots of f(x)-x are 1 and 2 .We now determine f(f(x))-x. Note that f(f(x))=left(x^{2}-2 x+2right)^{2}-2left(x^{2}-2 x+2right)+2= x^{4}-4 x^{3}+6 x^{2}-4 x+2. Therefore,f(f(x))-x=x^{4}-4 x^{3}+6 x^{2}-5 x+2 .Note that 1 is a root of f(f(x))-x.

Therefore, the real roots of f(f(x))-x are 1 and 2 .(b) The answer is 43 .First, we claim that if r is a root of f(x)-x, then r is a root of f(f(x))-x. Since r is a root of f(x)-x, f(r)-r=0, i.e. f(r)=r. Therefore,f(f(r))-r=f(r)-r=0 .Hence, any root of f(x)-x is a root of f(f(x))-x. Consequently, f(x)-x is a factor of f(f(x))-x.Note that f(f(x))-x=fleft(x^{2}-a x+bright)-x=left(x^{2}-a x+bright)^{2}-aleft(x^{2}-a x+bright)+b-x,=x^{4}-2 a x^{3}+left(a^{2}+2 b-aright) x^{2}-left(2 a b-a^{2}+1right) x+left(b^{2}-a b+bright) text {. }Since f(x)-x=x^{2}-(a+1) x+b, f(f(x))-x factors asf(f(x))-x=left(x^{2}-(a+1) x+bright)left(x^{2}-(a-1) x+(b-a+1)right) .Since both factors are monic, every root of f(f(x))-x is an integer if and only if the discriminants of both of these quadratic factors are perfect squares. These two discriminants are(a+1)^{2}-4 b=a^{2}+2 a+1-4 band(a-1)^{2}-4(b-a+1)=a^{2}+2 a+1-4 b-4 .The first discriminant is four larger than the second discriminant. The only two perfect squares that differ by 4 are 4 and 0 . This statement is true since if r, s are non-negative integers such that r^{2}-s^{2}=4, then (r-s)(r+s)=4. Since r, s are non-negative, (r-s, r+s)=(2,2) or (1,4). In the latter case, r-s=1 and r+s=4. Therefore, r=5 / 2 and s=3 / 2, which are not integers. Therefore, (r-s, r+s)=(2,2), i.e. r=2, s=0. Hence, the larger perfect square is 2^{2}=4 and the smaller perfect square is 0 .Therefore, a^{2}+2 a+1-4 b=4. Rearranging this and factoring yields(a+1)^{2}=4(b+1) .Since (a+1)^{2} and 4 are perfect squares, b+1 is a perfect square. Therefore, there exists a positive integer m such that b+1=m^{2}. Then b=m^{2}-1. Consequently, (a+1)^{2}=4 m^{2}. Since a is a positive integer, a+1=2 m. Hence, a=2 m-1. Therefore, (a, b)=left(2 m-1, m^{2}-1right).We now verify that all such (a, b) have the property that the roots of x^{2}-(a+1) x+b and x^{2}-(a-1) x+(b-a+1) are all integers, implying that every root of f(f(x))-x is an integer. Substituting (a, b)=left(2 m-1, m^{2}-1right) into these two polynomials yield x^{2}-2 m x+m^{2}-1= (x-(m-1))(x-(m+1)) and x^{2}-(2 m-2) x+left(m^{2}-2 m+1right)=(x-(m-1))(x-(m-1)). Since mathrm{m} is a positive integer, all four roots of f(f(x))-x is an integer. (Alternately, note that since the leading coefficient of each of the quadratic factors is 1 , the roots of the quadratic factors are all integers if and only if the discriminant of the quadratic factors are both perfect square.)Since 1 leq a, b leq 2011, it remains to find the number of positive integers m such that 1 leq 2 m-1, m^{2}-1 leq 2011. Since 1 leq m^{2}-1 leq 2011,2 leq m^{2} leq 2012. Hence, 2 leq m leqlfloorsqrt{2012}rfloor=44, where lfloor trfloor denotes the largest integer less than or equal to t. There are 43 solutions for m, namely m=2,3, ldots 44. These values of m clearly satisfy 1 leq 2 m-1 leq 2011.Therefore, the number of ordered positive integer pairs (a, b) that results in f(f(x))-x having all integer roots is 43 ."},{"problem":"Xiaoli has 18 yuan, and Xiaogang has 24 yuan.

For each of the middle digits, there are 10 possibilities, and for the first digit, there are 3 possibilities depending on the sum of the already chosen digits (either 1, 4, 7 or 2, 5, 8 or 3, 6, 9).

To form such a number, the digits following the 6 can be freely chosen from 9 possible digits (since 6 is not allowed), and the other digits (except the first) can be freely chosen from 10 possible digits.

The number of such numbers is the same as the number of (n)-digit numbers, which is (10^n - 10^{n-1}).The second category includes numbers obtained by appending a digit other than 6 to an (n)-digit number containing 6. Since there are 9 such digits, the number of such numbers is (9 f(n)).Thus, the total number of ((n+1))-digit numbers containing 6 is[f(n+1) = 10^n - 10^{n-1} + 9 f(n)]Since there is only one 1-digit number containing 6, (f(1) = 1). Using this initial value and the derived recurrence relation, we get (f(2) = 18), (f(3) = 252), (f(4) = 3168), and (f(5) = 37512).2. It is clear that if the number of elements in an arithmetic sequence is divisible by 3 and the common difference is 1 modulo 3, then exactly one-third of the elements are divisible by 3. This statement also holds for the union of multiple such sequences, provided they have no common elements. To prove that one-third of the five-digit numbers containing 6 are divisible by 3, we need to group these numbers into disjoint arithmetic sequences with 3 elements and a common difference of 1 modulo 3. This can be done as follows:Numbers ending in 6 form an arithmetic sequence starting at 10006 and ending at 99996, with 9000 elements and a common difference of 10. Numbers ending in other digits are grouped such that only the last digit differs. In each group, numbers ending in 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 form a 6-element sequence with a common difference of 1, and numbers ending in 7, 8, 9 form a 3-element sequence with a common difference of 1.Since all these sequences meet our criteria, we have proven that one-third of the five-digit numbers containing 6 are divisible by 3, which is (37512 / 3 = 12504).III. solution. Again, first determine the total number of five-digit numbers containing 6, and then prove that one-third of these numbers are divisible by 3.1. There are 90000 five-digit numbers in total. Determine the number of five-digit numbers not containing 6. Such a number is obtained by choosing the first digit from the 8 digits excluding 0 and 6, and the other four digits from the 9 digits excluding 6. The number of five-digit numbers not containing 6 is (8 cdot 9^4 = 52488). Therefore, the number of five-digit numbers containing 6 is (90000 - 52488 = 37512). This is a number divisible by 3.2.

Shmarov)","solution":"Answer. 1.First solution. We will prove by induction on N that there is one more even matching than odd. For N=1, the statement is obvious: there is only one matching, and it is even. Now we will prove the statement for 2N points, assuming it is true for 2(N-1) points. Let the marked points be A_{1}, A_{2}, ldots, A_{2N} in the order of traversal of the circle clockwise.Lemma. Suppose a chord A_{1}A_{i} is involved in the matching. Then for even i, it intersects an even number of chords, and for odd i, an odd number.Proof. Let the chord A_{1}A_{i} intersect exactly k chords. Consider the points A_{2}, ldots, A_{i-1}; exactly k of them are the endpoints of chords intersecting A_{1}A_{i} (one endpoint of each chord). The remaining i-2-k points are paired with points connected by chords that do not intersect A_{1}A_{i}. Thus, the number i-2-k is even, meaning that the numbers i and k have the same parity. The lemma is proved.Now we will divide all matchings into 2N-1 groups Pi_{2}, ldots, Pi_{2N}: the group Pi_{i} will contain those matchings in which point A_{1} is connected to A_{i}. Now, remove the chord A_{1}A_{i} from each matching in Pi_{i}; we will get all possible matchings on the remaining 2N-2 points. By the induction hypothesis, among them, there is one more even matching than odd. At the same time, if i is even, then according to the lemma, the parity of the matching does not change when removed, and if i is odd, it changes. Thus, in each of the N sets Pi_{2}, ldots, Pi_{2N}, there is one more even matching than odd, and in each of the N-1 sets Pi_{3}, ldots, Pi_{2N-1}, there is one more odd than even. In total, there are more even matchings than odd by N-(N-1)=1, which is what we needed to prove.Second solution. We will provide another proof of the induction step.Let the marked points be A_{1}, ldots, A_{2N}. Consider all matchings in which A_{2N-1} and A_{2N} are connected by a chord. This chord does not intersect any other. Thus, by removing it from each of the considered matchings, we will get all matchings on the points A_{1}, ldots, A_{2N-2}, and the parity of each of them will be preserved. By the induction hypothesis, among our matchings, there is one more even than odd.To complete the proof, it is sufficient to show that among all other matchings, there are equally many even and odd. Consider any of them; suppose it contains chords A_{2N-1}A_{i} and A_{2N}A_{k}. Now, \\"swap\\" the points A_{2N-1} and A_{2N}, that is, replace the chords with A_{2N}A_{i} and A_{2N-1}A_{k}. In this case, if the original chord intersected with some of the others, then the new chord will also intersect with it. On the other hand, if the chords A_{2N-1}A_{i} and A_{2N}A_{k} did not intersect, then the new chords will intersect, and vice versa. Thus, to each remaining even matching, we have associated an odd one, and vice versa; different matchings, obviously, correspond to different ones.

On the other hand, this digit is at most 4, because according to the third row, twice the preceding digit is a single-digit number. Thus, the first digit of the root is 4, and the complete divisor in the third row is a number between 80 and 89.The second digit of the root is 1, because if it were more, then the subtrahend in the fourth row would be a three-digit number, but it cannot be less, i.e., 0, because then the remainder in the fifth row would have to match the dividend in the third row. Thus, the subtrahend in the fourth row is 81, the remainder in the fifth row is (overline{x 7}), the dividend is (overline{x 7 x x}), and the temporary divisor is 82.The third digit of the root is at least 2, because the subtrahend in the sixth row is more digits than (overline{82 x}), the complete divisor, and at most 9. The hundreds digit of the subtrahend in the sixth row is either 7, like the hundreds digit of the dividend in the fifth row, or 6, but by adding 1 to the subtrahend, it becomes 7, which can only happen if the subtrahend is in the form (overline{x 699}). The subtrahend is the product (overline{82 x} cdot x) (where (x) stands for the same digit in both places). Here, (overline{2 x} cdot x < 300). Thus, the hundreds digit of the product can be 6 only if (8 cdot x) (which is even) ends in 6 with no remainder, or ends in 4 with a remainder of 2. The hundreds digit can be 7 only if (8 cdot x) ends in 8 with a remainder of 1. 6 is the double of 8 at 2 and 7 times, and 4 is the triple and 8 times of 3. Thus, the subtrahend is (822 cdot 2 = 1644), (823 cdot 3 = 2469), (827 cdot 7 = 5789), or (828 cdot 8 = 6624). None of these are in the form (overline{x 699}), and the hundreds digit is only 7 in the third one, so the square root could only have been taken from (417^2 + 1).

Proof: From ( P(2^{p-2}, 2^{p-2}) ), we have:   [   tau(2^{p-1}) = tau(2a_{2^{p-2}})   ]   Since ( tau(2^{p-1}) = p ) (because ( 2^{p-1} ) has ( p ) divisors), we get:   [   tau(2a_{2^{p-2}}) = p   ]   Since ( p ) is prime, the only integers ( n ) for which ( tau(n) = p ) are of the form ( q^{p-1} ) for some prime ( q ). Therefore:   [   2a_{2^{p-2}} = 2^{p-1} implies a_{2^{p-2}} = 2^{p-2}   ]   which proves the claim. (blacksquare)2. Claim 2: If ( n ) is a positive integer and ( p ) is prime such that ( p > n ge 2 ), then:   [   a_{p-n} + a_n = p   ]   Proof: From ( P(p-n, n) ), we have:   [   tau(p) = tau(a_{p-n} + a_n)   ]   Since ( tau(p) = 2 ) (because ( p ) is prime), we get:   [   tau(a_{p-n} + a_n) = 2   ]   This implies that ( a_{p-n} + a_n ) is a prime number.3. Subclaim 2.1: If ( n ) is a positive integer and ( p ) and ( q ) are primes such that ( p > q > n ge 2 ), then:   [   a_{p-n} ne a_{q-n}   ]   Proof: Suppose there exists ( n, p, q ) such that ( a_{p-n} = a_{q-n} ). Then this means ( a_{p-n} + a_n = a_{q-n} + a_n = r ) for some prime ( r ).   Since ( p > q ge 3 ), this means there is a positive integer ( k ) which lies strictly between ( p ) and ( q ), where ( k ) is composite. Since ( a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots ) is an increasing sequence, this means that ( a_{k-n} + a_n = r ), which implies that ( a_{k-n} + a_n ) is prime.   However, from ( P(k-n, n) ):   [   tau(k) = tau(a_{k-n} + a_n) implies tau(k) = 2   ]   which implies that ( k ) is prime, which is a contradiction. (blacksquare)4. Now, we prove Claim 2. Let ( m ) be the smallest prime such that ( 2^{m-2} > p ), and let ( S ) be the set of all positive integers less than ( 2^{m-2} ) which are of the form ( q-n ) for some prime ( q ), and ( T ) be the set ( {s_k mid k in S} ).   Since ( s_k < s_{2^{m-2}} = 2^{m-2} ), this means all the elements of ( T ) must be less than ( 2^{m-2} ) as well. We know that all of the elements from ( T ) must be of the form ( p-n ) as well, which implies that ( T subseteq S ).   Furthermore, according to Subclaim 2.1, we find that ( a_{p-n} ne a_{q-n} ) for any primes ( p ) and ( q ) satisfying ( p > q > n ge 2 ). This implies that all the elements of ( T ) are distinct. This shows that ( |S| = |T| ), which implies that ( S = T ).   Therefore, ( a_{p-n} = p-n ) for all ( n ) and prime ( p ) satisfying ( p > n ge 2 ). (blacksquare)5. Finally, we use induction to complete the proof that ( a_n = n ) for all positive integers ( n ).   The base cases are when ( n = 1 ) and ( n = 2 ), which easily follows from Claim 1.   For the inductive step, suppose that we know that ( a_n = n ) for all ( n = 1, 2, 3, ldots, k ).   According to Bertrand's Postulate, there exists a prime ( p ) such that ( k < p < 2k ). Also, ( p - k < 2k - k = k ). From our induction hypothesis, this implies that ( a_{p-k} = p - k ). Hence, from Claim 2:   [   a_k + a_{p-k} = p implies a_k + (p - k) = p implies a_k = k   ]   which completes the proof.

Luíza, a curious mathematician, found a piece of paper stating that the total score of all participants was 210 points.a) How many players participated in the tournament?b) The following image was the logo of the tournament and was on the paper that Luíza found.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_01_09dbad5281c800d666d6g-21.jpg?height=536&width=529&top_left_y=1543&top_left_x=867)Luíza paused for a few seconds observing it and noticed that there was a knight in the center, with the black squares illustrating the ones the knight could move to in one move. She then wondered:- If this board were infinite, and the knight maintained the movement pattern, how many squares could the knight reach in two moves?Initially, she thought \\"64,\\" but quickly realized she was wrong. Now, it's up to you, answer Luíza's question correctly.c) Luíza received a message from a friend who participated in the tournament, informing her that he scored 12 points. Luíza replied: “- Don't be sad, you'll win the next championship!\\". How did Luíza know that her friend had not won the tournament?","solution":"Solutiona) Let x be the number of chess players. Since in each match exactly one point is contested, the total number of points is equal to the number of games. Each athlete will play (x-1) cdot 2 matches, as they will play against all the others twice. However, the matches a times b and b times a will be counted both in the list of games of \\" a \\" and in that of \\" b \\". Thus, the total number of games can be obtained by the equationbegin{array}{r}frac{x cdot(x-1) cdot 2}{2}=210 x cdot(x-1)=210end{array}Since x is a positive integer, we can analyze all 8 ways to write 210 as a product of 2 positive integers: 1 cdot 210, 2 cdot 105, 3 cdot 70, ldots, 14 cdot 15 and conclude that only one of them is formed by consecutive numbers. Therefore,begin{aligned}x cdot(x-1) & =15 cdot 14 x & =15end{aligned}Thus, there were 15 players in the tournament.b) First, notice that with two moves, regardless of the chosen square, the knight can return to the starting square, which is the common destination possible from the eight highlighted squares after the first move. Each square, by repeating the move made, will have a unique square that can only be reached by it. Finally, imagining a circle centered on the central square and containing all the knights on its boundary, we can see that every pair of knights can have a common square besides the central square, except for the knights that are diametrically opposite. Since each knight reaches 8 squares on the second move, but 7 excluding the central square and 6 of them are accessible to another knight, then on the second move, a total of frac{8 cdot 6}{2}+8 new positions are obtained, in addition to the central square.

Consider the situation where all numbers mentioned in both the first and second questions are in the same positions in the answers.As the desired set, we will take the set where k_{i}, l_{i} in {a_{2i-1}, a_{i}}, i=1,2, ldots, 50, and, moreover, in each quartet left(a_{4m-3}, a_{4m-2}, a_{4m-1}, a_{4m}right), m=1,2, ldots, 25, there were no comparisons of adjacent pairs of numbers from this quartet in the first two questions. We will show that such a set exists.Let X be the set of numbers that did not appear in the first two questions.

Each of the 100 numbers is part of at least one uncovered pair, and therefore, must appear in at least one of the subsequent questions.Suppose that in this situation, all uncovered pairs can be covered in two questions; then each of the 100 numbers must appear in exactly one of such questions. Considering quartets of the form (a_{4i-3}, a_{4i-2}, a_{4i-1}, a_{4i}), i=1,2, ldots, 25, we note that if one number from such a quartet appears in a question, then the other three must also (otherwise, not all pairs of adjacent numbers in this quartet will be covered). But then the number of numbers in the set about which the question is asked must be divisible by 4. Since 50 is not divisible by 4, we have a contradiction.

The first question is about the set M_{1}={1,2, ldots, 50}, the second is about the set M_{2}={51,52, ldots, 100}. The set M_{3} will consist of the 25 leftmost numbers of the set M_{1} and the 25 leftmost numbers of the set M_{2}, and the set M_{4} will consist of the 25 rightmost numbers of the set M_{1} and the 25 rightmost numbers of the set M_{2}. The answer to the question about the set M_{3} will clearly determine the numbers a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{25}, and the answer to the question about the set M_{4} will determine the numbers a_{76}, a_{77}, ldots, a_{100}.

Sharik and Matroskin are skiing on a circular track, half of which is an uphill climb and the other half is a downhill descent. Their speeds on the climb are the same and four times slower than their speeds on the descent. The minimum distance by which Sharik lags behind Matroskin is 4 km, and the maximum distance is 13 km. Find the length of the track.","solution":"Answer: 24 km. Solution. The minimum lag of Sharik behind Matroskin occurs when Sharik is at the lowest point of the track, and Matroskin is climbing the hill (if Matroskin were descending at this time, it would mean that half of the track is less than 4 km, which is obviously impossible). And it remains until Matroskin reaches the highest point. After that, Sharik climbs another 4 km uphill, while Matroskin descends. If Matroskin had been descending all this time, he would have moved away from Sharik (or rather, from the highest point) by 16 km. But the distance stopped increasing when Matroskin was 13 km ahead of Sharik, which means Matroskin had reached the lowest point of the track and started climbing the hill. Since the lag increased by 3 km for each kilometer Sharik traveled, and it increased by a total of 9 km, Sharik had 4-(13-4)/(4-1) = 1 km left to the highest point when Matroskin reached the lowest point. Therefore, the length of the descent is 13-1 = 12 km, and the entire track is 24 km."},{"problem":"Given that the function f(x) is an odd function defined on the domain mathbb{R} and is monotonically increasing on the interval [0,+infty), if dfrac {|f(ln x)-f(ln dfrac {1}{x})|}{2} < f(1), then the range of x is (quad)  A: (0, dfrac {1}{e})  B: (0,e)  C: ( dfrac {1}{e},e)  D: (e,+infty)","solution":"Since f(x) is an odd function defined on mathbb{R};  therefore f(ln x)-f(ln dfrac {1}{x})=f(ln x)+f(ln x)=2f(ln x);  therefore from dfrac {|f(ln x)-f(ln dfrac {1}{x})|}{2} < f(1), we get |f(ln x)| < f(1);  therefore -f(1) < f(ln x) < f(1);  Furthermore, since f(x) is increasing on [0,+infty), therefore f(x) is increasing on (-infty,0];  therefore f(x) is increasing on mathbb{R};  therefore -1 < ln x < 1;  therefore dfrac {1}{e} < x < e,  therefore the solution set of the original inequality is ( dfrac {1}{e},e)  Hence, the correct choice is: boxed{C}.

Suppose this is not true, and there are at least 13 acquaintances among the members. Then, by the pigeonhole principle, there are 2 girls who together know at least 6 boys. However, they cannot know more boys, as there are only 5 boys, and they can know at most one of them together. Thus, there are 2 girls who together have 6 acquaintances, and each of them knows every boy, and one of them is known by both. In this case, however, each of the other girls can have at most 2 acquaintances, one from the above girls and one from the other boys they know, otherwise, one of them would have 2 common acquaintances. Thus, the 5 girls together have at most (6 + 3 cdot 2 = 12) acquaintances, which contradicts our assumption.In the first figure, it is shown that 12 acquaintances are possible in a way that meets the conditions.

Suppose there are more than 21. Then, by the pigeonhole principle, there is a girl who has at least 4 acquaintances. If another girl together with her knows all the boys, then the two of them together have at most 8 acquaintances, and the others, according to the reasoning used in the previous cases, can have at most 2 each, so the total number of acquaintances is at most (8 + 5 cdot 2 = 18), which is a contradiction. Therefore, there is no girl who knows all the \\"free\\" boys not known by the first girl.However, 22 acquaintances can only arise if the first girl knows exactly 4 boys, and each of the other girls knows 2 \\"free\\" boys and 1 boy from the acquaintances of the first girl. ((22 = 4 + 6 cdot 3, 22) more acquaintances cannot arise.) This means that among the 6 girls, there are definitely two who have a common acquaintance among the 4 boys known by the first girl (again using the pigeonhole principle, (6 > 4)). But these two girls also know 2 out of the 3 \\"free\\" boys, so they have a common acquaintance among the \\"free\\" boys, which contradicts the conditions of the problem. Therefore, the number of acquaintances is indeed at most 21.That 21 acquaintances are possible is shown by the table in the second figure. The rows represent the girls, and the columns represent the boys. A 1 is written at the intersection of a row and a column if the corresponding boy and girl know each other.

Express (k) in terms of (u) and (v):   Let (k = 3x^2 - 4xy + 3y^2). Define (u = x + y) and (v = x - y). Then,   [   k = frac{u^2 + 5v^2}{2}   ]   This transformation helps us analyze the properties of (k).2. Consider any prime (p) dividing (k):   Since ((k, 30) = 1), it follows that (p ge 7). If (p) divides both (u) and (v), then (k ge 3p^2 ge 147). We assume (p nmid u) and (p nmid v).3. Analyze the quadratic residue ((-5/p)):   We need to consider the cases based on the value of (p mod 4).   Case 1: (p equiv 1 pmod{4})   - Here, ((-1/p) = 1), so ((5/p) = 1).   - By quadratic reciprocity, ((5/p)(p/5) = 1), which implies ((p/5) = 1).   - Since (p neq 5), it follows that (p equiv pm 1 pmod{4}). Consequently, (p equiv 1 pmod{20}) or (p equiv 9 pmod{20}).   Case 2: (p equiv 3 pmod{4})   - Here, ((-1/p) = -1), so ((5/p) = -1).   - By quadratic reciprocity, ((5/p)(p/5) = 1), which implies ((p/5) = -1).   - Hence, (p equiv pm 2 pmod{5}). This yields (p equiv 7 pmod{20}) or (p equiv 3 pmod{20}).4. Combine the cases:   Combining the results from both cases, we find that (p in {1, 3, 7, 9} pmod{20}) for any prime (p) dividing (k = 3x^2 - 4xy + 3y^2 = frac{u^2 + 5v^2}{2}).5. Find the smallest such prime (p):   The smallest prime (p) in the set ({1, 3, 7, 9} pmod{20}) is (23). Therefore, (k ge 23).6. Verify with an example:   We need to find (u) and (v) such that (u^2 + 5v^2 = 46). One solution is ((u, v) = (1, 3)), which gives ((x, y) = (2, -1)). Thus, (k = 23).7. Check divisibility:   For ((x, y) = (2, -1)), we have (k = 23).

For example:Find the smallest positive period of f(x)=(sin x)^{2008}+(cos x)^{20107}.Solution: fleft(frac{pi}{2}-xright)=(cos x)^{2000}+(sin x)^{2007}, it is easy to see that f_{1}(x)=(sin x)^{2007} is an odd function, and f_{1}(x+T)=f_{1}(x) Leftrightarrow sin (x+T)=sin x. Therefore, the smallest positive period of f_{1}(x) is the same as that of sin x, both being T_{1}= 2 pi; f_{2}(x)=(cos x)^{20018} is an even function, and f_{2}(x+T)=f_{2}(x) Leftrightarrow|cos (x+T)|=|cos x|, so the smallest positive period of f_{2}(x) is the same as that of |cos x|, both being T_{2}=pi. Hence, the smallest positive period of fleft(frac{pi}{2}-xright) is the least common multiple of T_{1} and T_{2}, which is 2 pi. Since the smallest positive period of f(x) is the same as that of fleft(frac{pi}{2}-xright), the smallest positive period of f(x) is 2 pi.In general, if f_{1}(x) represents one of the six basic trigonometric functions (sin x, cos x, tan x, cot x, sec x, csc x), and f(x)=a f_{1}^{2 n}(x)+b cos ^{2 m-1} xleft(n, m in mathbf{N}^{*}, a b neq 0right), then the smallest positive period of f(x) is 2 pi.Note: When finding T_{1} and T_{2}, it is essential to consider that the domain of f_{1}(x) and f_{2}(x) is the common domain D, otherwise the conclusion may not hold.Counterexample: Let n in mathbf{Z}, the odd function f_{1}(x)=sin pi x, x neq 2 n, and the even function f_{2}(x)=left{begin{array}{l}0, x neq 4 n  1, x=4 nend{array}right., then T_{1}=2, T_{2}=4, and the least common multiple of T_{1} and T_{2} is 4, but the smallest positive period of f(x)=f_{1}(x)+f_{2}(x)=sin pi x, x neq 2 n is T=2.Why is this so? The reason lies in the fact that when finding T_{1}, the domain of f_{1}(x) is mathbf{R}, not the common domain D={x mid x neq 2 n, n in mathbf{Z}, x in mathbf{R}} of f_{1}(x) and f_{2}(x). In fact, the smallest positive period of f_{1}(x)(x in D) is T_{1}=2."},{"problem":"Each pair of vertices of a regular 67-gon is joined by a line segment. Suppose n of these segments are selected, and each of them is painted one of ten available colors. Find the minimum possible value of n for which, regardless of which n segments were selected and how they were painted, there will always be a vertex of the polygon that belongs to seven segments of the same color.","solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of segments ( n ) such that, regardless of how these segments are selected and painted with one of ten colors, there will always be a vertex of the polygon that belongs to seven segments of the same color.1. Understanding the Problem:   - We have a regular 67-gon.   - Each pair of vertices is joined by a line segment.   - We need to find the minimum ( n ) such that there is always a vertex connected to seven segments of the same color.2. Total Number of Segments:   - The total number of segments in a 67-gon is given by the combination formula:     [     binom{67}{2} = frac{67 times 66}{2} = 2211     ]3. Pigeonhole Principle Application:   - We need to ensure that for any selection of ( n ) segments and any coloring, there is a vertex connected to seven segments of the same color.   - We will use the pigeonhole principle to determine the minimum ( n ).4. Claim 1: ( n = 2011 ) is a possible value:   - Suppose we have ( n = 2011 ) segments.   - By the pigeonhole principle, if we divide these 2011 segments among 10 colors, at least one color will have:     [     leftlceil frac{2011}{10} rightrceil = 202 text{ segments}     ]   - Consider these 202 segments of the same color. Each segment connects two vertices, so there are ( 2 times 202 = 404 ) vertex incidences.   - Since there are 67 vertices, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one vertex must be connected to:     [     leftlceil frac{404}{67} rightrceil = 7 text{ segments of the same color}     ]   - Therefore, ( n = 2011 ) ensures that there is always a vertex connected to seven segments of the same color.5. Claim 2: ( n = 2010 ) has a counterexample:   - To show that ( n = 2010 ) is not sufficient, we need to construct a scenario where no vertex is connected to seven segments of the same color.   - This is more complex and typically involves a detailed combinatorial argument or construction. However, the essence is that with ( n = 2010 ), it is possible to distribute the segments and colors in such a way that no vertex ends up with seven segments of the same color.The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 2011 } )"},{"problem":"80.

Clearly, in the isosceles triangle A T C, the segment T H is the height, and therefore it is also the median. Thus, 3 - x_{1} = A H = H C = x_{2} - 3, from which we get x_{1} = 6 - x_{2}.Let M be the point with coordinates (0, 3). Since T H = T M = 3 and T A = T B, the right triangles A T H and B T M are equal by the leg and hypotenuse. Therefore, 3 - x_{1} = H A = M B = 3 - b, that is, x_{1} = b = frac{x_{1} cdot x_{2}}{12} (by Vieta's theorem), from which we find x_{2} = 12. Finally, x_{1} = 6 - x_{2} = 6 - 12 = -6 and b = x_{1} = -6.Another solution. As in the previous solution, let the abscissas of points A and C be x_{1} and x_{2}, respectively; we will also use the fact that point B has coordinates (0 ; b). Immediately, we understand that O A = |x_{1}| = -x_{1}, O C = |x_{2}| = x_{2}, and O B = |b| = -b.Let's find the second intersection of the circle with the y-axis, let this be point D with coordinates (0 ; d) (Fig. 12). The chords A C and B D of the circle intersect at the origin O; from the properties of the circle, we know that O A cdot O C = O B cdot O D. We get -x_{1} cdot x_{2} = -b cdot d, from which, replacing x_{1} cdot x_{2} with 12b by Vieta's theorem, we get d = 12.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_86512448fd32765ac040g-40.jpg?height=521&width=571&top_left_y=83&top_left_x=437)Fig. 12: to the solution of problem 10.7It remains to note that triangle BTD is isosceles, and the midpoint of its base, point M, has coordinates (0 ; 3).

If f^{-1}(x) is an odd function over its domain, then the positive real number a equals ______.","solution":"Since f^{-1}(x) is given to be an odd function over its domain, it follows that the original function f(x) must also be odd over its domain. For a function to be odd, it must satisfy the property that f(-x) = -f(x). Let us use this property to find the value of a.For f(x) to be odd, we require f(0) = 0. Let's calculate f(0):f(0) = 2^0 - a cdot 2^0 = 1 - a.Setting this equal to zero gives us:1 - a = 0.Solving for a, we find:a = 1.Thus, the original function simplifies to:f(x) = 2^x - frac{1}{2^x}.To verify that f(x) is indeed an odd function, we can show that f(-x) = -f(x) holds:f(-x) = 2^{-x} - frac{1}{2^{-x}} = frac{1}{2^x} - 2^x.-f(x) = -left(2^x - frac{1}{2^x}right) = frac{1}{2^x} - 2^x.Therefore, the two expressions are equivalent, confirming that f(x) is an odd function.In conclusion, the value of a that makes the inverse function f^{-1}(x) an odd function is:boxed{a = 1}."},{"problem":"Example 18.

Calculate the number of ways to draw 2 balls of different colors:   - To draw 2 balls of different colors, one must be red and the other yellow.   - The number of ways to draw 1 red ball from the 3 available is C_{3}^{1} = 3.   - The number of ways to draw 1 yellow ball from the 2 available is C_{2}^{1} = 2.   - Thus, the total number of ways to draw 1 red and 1 yellow ball is the product of these two, which is C_{3}^{1} cdot C_{2}^{1} = 3 cdot 2 = 6.3. Calculate the probability:   - The probability of drawing 2 balls of different colors is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.   - Here, the number of favorable outcomes (drawing 2 balls of different colors) is 6, and the total number of outcomes (drawing any 2 balls) is 10.   - Therefore, the probability P is dfrac{6}{10} = dfrac{3}{5}.In conclusion, the probability that the two balls drawn are of different colors is boxed{dfrac{3}{5}}."},{"problem":"13.

Let E^{prime} and F^{prime} be the points of intersection of E Q with A P and F Q with B P, respectively, and let T be the point of intersection of the lines P Q and C D.

Let O be the center of the circumcircle of triangle A P B, then O K and O L are the perpendicular bisectors of segments A P and B P, respectively. Let angle D A P=varphi for brevity. Then angle C B P=varphi, since the angles angle D A P and angle C B P subtend the same arc. Therefore, triangles C B P and D A P are similar by two angles and, hence,frac{A P}{B P}=frac{A D}{B C}=frac{A E}{B F}=frac{A E cos varphi}{B F cos varphi}=frac{A E^{prime}}{B F^{prime}}Thus,frac{P E^{prime}}{P F^{prime}}=frac{A P-A E^{prime}}{B P-B F^{prime}}=frac{A P}{B P}=frac{P K}{P L}Let the lines K O and P Q intersect at point K^{prime}, and the lines L O and P Q intersect at point L^{prime}.

Clearly, it also lies on line ell. Then the lines A S, D H, and E Q are parallel, and since A E=E D, line E Q is the midline of trapezoid A D H S. Therefore, E Q intersects line ell at the midpoint of segment S H. Similarly, line F Q also intersects line ell at the midpoint of segment S H. But then lines E Q, F Q, and ell intersect at the midpoint of segment S H and this point is point Q. Therefore, Q also lies on line ell.

Prove that no matter how the piles are divided, the sum of all the products remains constant.","solution":"Explanation: This is a constant value problem, meaning the sum of the products of the number of balls in each pile is independent of the method of division and depends only on the number of balls n.We can start with the simplest cases, making n specific and simple. The simplest cases are when n=1,2,3,4,5.For convenience, let's denote this sum of all products as f(n).When n=1, there is only one ball, so obviously f(1)=0.When n=2, two balls are divided into two piles, each with one ball, and cannot be divided further, so f(2)=1 times 1=1.When n=3, we can use a diagram to represent it, where (3) represents 3 balls, (2) and (1) represent 2 balls and 1 ball, respectively. The arrow rightarrow indicates the process of dividing the piles.Thus, f(3)=1 times 2+f(1)+f(2)=3.When n=4, there are different ways to divide the piles:So, f(4)=1 times 3+f(1)+f(3)=6;(4) longrightarrowleft{begin{array}{l}text { (2) } xrightarrow{text { reduced to the case of } n=2 text { }} f(2)=1  text { (2) } xrightarrow{text { reduced to the case of } n=2 text { }} f(2)=1end{array}right.So, f(4)=2 times 2+f(2)+f(2)=6.When n=5, there are different ways to divide the piles:So, f(5)=1 times 4+f(1)+f(4)=10;So, f(5)=2 times 3+f(2)+f(3)=10.From the above special cases, what inspiration do we get?Taking n=5 as an example, let's reconsider the problem of dividing piles.From the requirements of the problem, the final result is always to divide into piles of one ball each. Therefore, it is equivalent to each pair of balls being separated once. Let these 5 balls be {A, B, C, D, E}. When these 5 balls are in one pile, each pair of them can form a pair, i.e., {A B, A C, A D, A E, B C, B D, B E, C D, C E, D E}, a total of 10 pairs. If these 5 balls are divided into two piles, one with two balls, for example, {A, B}, and the other with three balls, for example, {C, D, E}, this division actually separates A C, A D, A E, B C, B D, B E, a total of 6 pairs. The product of the number of balls in these two piles is exactly 2 times 3=6. If {A, B} is further divided into {A} and {B}, this is equivalent to separating the ball pair A B. If {C, D, E} is divided into {C} and {D, E}, this separates C D and C E, two pairs. Finally, if {D, E} is divided into {D} and {E}, this separates the ball pair D E. From the above, we know that f(5)=10, which is exactly the number of all possible pairs of 5 balls.Therefore, in the general case, the final result of dividing n balls into piles is the number of all possible pairs of these n balls, i.e., frac{n(n-1)}{2}.Thus, f(n)=frac{n(n-1)}{2}.In this way, from the relationship between \\"separating pairs\\" and \\"dividing piles,\\" we can prove the problem.If you have learned about recurrence relations, following the process of the simple cases above, we can also derive the recurrence relation:f(n)=m(n-m)+f(m)+f(n-m) text {. }Dividing n balls into piles is a general problem. When thinking about this problem, we start with simple cases, i.e., n=1,2,3,4,5, and use a trial-by-trial method to explore, thereby gaining an essential understanding of the problem, i.e., dividing n balls into piles, one by one, until they cannot be divided further, is essentially separating all possible pairs of these n balls. This approach of starting with simple cases not only helps in guessing the result but also provides a solution strategy."},{"problem":"## Task A-2.1.Determine all pairs (a, b) of integers such that the area of the triangle whose vertices are the points where the parabola y=x^{2}+a x+b intersects the coordinate axes is 3.","solution":"## Solution.Let A and B be the intersections of the parabola with the x-axis, and C be the intersection with the y-axis.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_30_659ee8c29a87e0ecc7d7g-07.jpg?height=810&width=666&top_left_y=1077&top_left_x=615)Then A=left(x_{1}, 0right), B=left(x_{2}, 0right), where x_{1}, x_{2} are the roots of the function f(x)=x^{2}+a x+b and |A B|=left|x_{1}-x_{2}right|.By Viète's formulas, we haveleft(x_{1}-x_{2}right)^{2}=left(x_{1}+x_{2}right)^{2}-4 x_{1} x_{2}=a^{2}-4 b, quad text { i.e. } quad|A B|=sqrt{a^{2}-4 b} . quad 2 text { points }The point C has coordinates (0, b), so the length of the height of triangle A B C is |b|.The area of triangle A B C is3=frac{sqrt{a^{2}-4 b} cdot|b|}{2}from which it follows that left(a^{2}-4 bright) cdot b^{2}=36.Since b^{2} divides the number 36, it follows that b^{2} in{1,4,9,36}.We consider four cases:1.

Given the quadratic polynomial ( p(x) ) with integer coefficients, we know that ( p(41) = 42 ). We need to find ( p(1) ).2. We are also given that for some integers ( a, b > 41 ), ( p(a) = 13 ) and ( p(b) = 73 ).3. Let's consider the polynomial in terms of a shifted variable: ( P(x) = p(x + 41) ).

We will prove that the question is equivalent to counting the number of ways to split 2014 into three ordered non-negative addends 2014=x+y+z, for which the non-strict triangle inequality holds, i.e., x+y geq z, x+z geq y, y+z geq x.Necessity. If we choose a and b, then we have formed three numerical segments, in which there are 2014 numbers in total. It is clear that if the number of numbers in one of them is greater than the sum of the numbers in the other two, we will not be able to shuffle the numbers in the specified way.Sufficiency. Choose a=x+1, b=x+y+2, that is, divide the sequence into parts with x, y and z numbers. We will prove that we can shuffle the numbers in the specified way. Assume x geq y geq z. It is known that y+z geq x, and the other inequalities are automatically satisfied. Now we will swap numbers from y and z in pairs until the number of untouched numbers in y and z is exactly x. After that, we swap all numbers from x with all untouched numbers from y and z and obtain the desired permutation.Why is this possible? First, the number of numbers in y and z is at least x by the triangle inequality, and each action reduces the number of untouched numbers by 2. But x+y+z=2014, so x and (y+z) have the same parity, which means we will eventually get the required result.Counting the ways: We will iterate over x.

A decagon has 10 vertices. Step 1: We choose one vertex from the decagon. There are 10 choices for this step.Step 2: We then choose a second vertex to form a diagonal. However, the chosen second vertex must not be adjacent to the first vertex, so it cannot be either of the two neighbors of the chosen vertex. Since each vertex has 2 neighbors, this leaves us with 10 - 1 - 2 = 7 non-adjacent vertices to choose from (the -1 is because we can't choose the same vertex again).Step 3: Each diagonal is counted twice because choosing vertex A and then vertex B forms the same diagonal as choosing vertex B and then vertex A. To correct for this, we divide the count by 2.Using these steps, the total number of diagonals D in a convex decagon is calculated as follows: D = frac {10 times 7}{2} = frac {70}{2} = 35 So the convex decagon has boxed{35} diagonals."},{"problem":"Definition: If the function y=f(x) has a point x_{0}(a < x_{0} < b) in the given interval [a,b] within its domain, satisfying f(x_{0})= dfrac {f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}, then the function y=f(x) is called an \\"average value function\\" on [a,b], and x_{0} is one of its mean value points.

The domain of f(x) is all real numbers (mathbb{R}).1. Odd Function Property: We verify if f(x) is an odd function. An odd function satisfies f(-x) = -f(x). For f(x) = x - sin x, we find f(-x) = -x - sin(-x) = -x + sin x because sin(-x) = -sin(x). Therefore, f(-x) = -f(x), confirming that f(x) is indeed an odd function.2. Monotonicity: To determine if f(x) is increasing or decreasing, we calculate its derivative: {f'}(x) = 1 - cos x. Since cos x leq 1 for all x in mathbb{R}, it follows that {f'}(x) = 1 - cos x geq 0.

Square both sides: This step seems a bit off since we don't actually square both sides of the equation. Instead, we complete the square to make it easier to solve. Let's correct this step:   - First, we move the constant term to the other side:        x^{2}-2x=1      - Then, we complete the square by adding (frac{-2}{2})^2 = 1 to both sides:        x^{2}-2x+1=2      - This gives us a perfect square on the left:        (x-1)^{2}=23.

The perpendicular bisector of a side of a triangle is the line that is perpendicular to that side and bisects it.

At this point, there are two scenarios.(1) If points A and B are not connected, this can be further divided into two scenarios: the four points connected to points A and B are not repeated; the four points connected to points A and B have one repetition (if the points connected to A and B have two repetitions, a quadrilateral will be formed).By the pigeonhole principle, it is known that among the four points connected to point C, there must be two points in one of the above two groups, forming a triangle or a quadrilateral, which is a contradiction.(2) If points A and B are connected, assume point A is connected to A_{1}, A_{2}, and A_{3}, and point B is connected to B_{1}, B_{2}, and B_{3}, as shown in Figure 6.Similarly, by the pigeonhole principle, a contradiction is derived. The lemma is proved.For the original problem, there are two scenarios to discuss.(1) The maximum degree of all points is 4.By the lemma, it is known that there are two points with a degree of 4, and the degree of the remaining points is 3. Assume these two points are A and B. At this point, the degree of the points other than A and B is all 3.(i) If points A and B are not connected, this can be further divided into two scenarios: the four points connected to points A and B are not repeated; the four points connected to points A and B have one repetition (if the points connected to A and B have two repetitions, a quadrilateral will be formed). In addition, there is at most one point D.But each group of points needs to draw two more edges (not to the points in the same group, but to the other group, drawing at most one edge), so the edges drawn to point D are more than 4, which is a contradiction.(ii) If points A and B are connected, assume point A is connected to A_{1}, A_{2}, and A_{3}, and point B is connected to B_{1}, B_{2}, and B_{3}, as shown in Figure 6. The other two points are C and D.Similarly, it is known that A_{i} and B_{i} (i=1,2,3) each draw one edge to point C or D. Therefore, one of the points C and D draws three edges, forming a quadrilateral, which is a contradiction.(2) The maximum degree of the points is not less than 5, assume the maximum degree is i (i geqslant 5).Assume the point with a degree of i is A, and the i points connected to it are A_{1}, A_{2}, ..., A_{i}; the other 9-i points are B_{1}, B_{2}, ..., B_{9-i}. Then the points B_{j} (j=1,2, cdots, 9-i) can only be connected to A_{1}, A_{2}, ..., A_{i}. Among them, B_{j} cannot be connected to two points at the same time (otherwise, a quadrilateral will appear).Therefore, the maximum number of line segments that can be connected between B_{1}, B_{2}, ..., B_{9-i} and A_{1}, A_{2}, ..., A_{i} is 9-i.Then consider how many line segments can be connected within B_{1}, B_{2}, ..., B_{9-i}.According to the assumption, it is necessary to connect 16-(9-i)-i=7 more line segments.The maximum number of line segments that can be connected among 9-i points ismathrm{C}_{9-i}^{2}=frac{(9-i)(8-i)}{2}.By i geqslant 5, it is known that mathrm{C}_{9-i}^{2} leqslant 6<7, which is a contradiction, and this scenario is excluded.In summary, the maximum number of line segments cannot be 16.

Let the set A=left{a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{2m-1}right}, and a_{1} < a_{2} < cdots < a_{2m-1}. Define x_{i}=a_{2i-1}-a_{2i-2} for i=2,3,cdots,m.

According to the problem, the product of the digits (ab) is 17 more than their sum (a + b). This can be written as:   [   ab = a + b + 17   ]3. Rearrange the equation to isolate the product and sum terms on one side:   [   ab - a - b = 17   ]4. Add 1 to both sides to facilitate factoring:   [   ab - a - b + 1 = 18   ]5.

From the relationship between the roots and coefficients of a quadratic equation, we have:1. The sum of the roots: a + b = m2. The product of the roots: ab = nGiven that m > 0 and n > 0, it implies that both a and b are positive. Since a, b, and -1 can be arranged to form either an arithmetic progression (AP) or a geometric progression (GP), and considering their signs, the only feasible sequences are a, -1, b or b, -1, a. Therefore, we have ab = (-1)^2 = 1, leading to n = 1.For the case of forming an arithmetic progression:1. When -1, a, frac{1}{a} form an AP, we have the middle term a equal to the average of the other two, leading to the equation 2a = frac{1}{a} - 1. Simplifying this gives 2a^2 + a - 1 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation, we discard a = -1 (since a is positive) and find a = frac{1}{2}. Consequently, b = frac{1}{a} = 2, and thus m = a + b = frac{1}{2} + 2 = frac{5}{2}.2. When -1, frac{1}{a}, a form an AP, we have the middle term frac{1}{a} equal to the average of the other two, leading to the equation frac{2}{a} = a - 1. Simplifying this gives a^2 - a - 2 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation, we discard a = -1 (since a is positive) and find a = 2. Consequently, b = frac{1}{a} = frac{1}{2}, and thus m = a + b = 2 + frac{1}{2} = frac{5}{2}.Combining both cases, we conclude that m = frac{5}{2}.

How many lines are there such that a rotation of at most 180^{circ} about them can map mathcal{O} onto itself?","solution":"Solution. Since in a rotation about an axis, only the points on the axis are fixed, and the center K of the octahedron is also fixed, the possible axes must pass through the center of the octahedron. Thus, every such axis intersects the surface of the octahedron at exactly two points (P and P') symmetrically placed with respect to K. We distinguish three cases based on whether these two points are vertices, interior points of edges, or interior points of faces.1. Case, if P is a vertex. There are three such lines, which connect pairs of opposite vertices. The 90^circ rotations about these lines are suitable. It is sufficient to verify this on the vertices: P and P' remain fixed, while the remaining four vertices form the four vertices of a square, and the 90^circ rotation about the P P' axis acts as a 90^circ rotation about the center of the square, thus the vertices are indeed cyclically mapped to each other.2. Case, if P is an interior point of an edge AB. The image of the edge AB under rotation is also an edge. Furthermore, since P is fixed during the rotation, the image of the edge AB also passes through P. This can only be true if the image of AB is itself, so the image of A is B (since A cannot be fixed). This implies that P must necessarily be the midpoint of the edge AB.There are 6 lines connecting the midpoints of opposite edges, and every 180^circ rotation about these lines is suitable. Indeed, the endpoints of the edge AB containing P, and the edge A'B' containing P', are swapped by the rotation, while the segment connecting the remaining two vertices intersects P P' perpendicularly at K, so the rotation also maps these two vertices to each other.3. Case, if P is an interior point of the equilateral triangle face ABC. Similarly to the second case, it can be shown that the image of the triangle ABC must necessarily be itself. Since the vertices of ABC are not fixed, there are two possibilities: A' = B, B' = C, and C' = A; or A' = C, C' = B, and B' = A. In both cases, the fixed point P must be equidistant from all three vertices, so P is the center of the face ABC.There are 4 lines connecting the centers of opposite faces, and the 120^circ rotations about these lines are suitable. Indeed, the axis P P' intersects the face ABC perpendicularly, so the 120^circ rotation about P P' acts as a 120^circ rotation about P in the plane of ABC, thus mapping the vertices A, B, and C to each other. Similar reasoning applies to the opposite face.In total, there are 13 suitable axes."},{"problem":"If a^5 +5a^4 +10a^3 +3a^2 -9a-6 = 0 where a is a real number other than -1, what is (a + 1)^3? textbf{a)} 1qquadtextbf{b)} 3sqrt 3qquadtextbf{c)} 7qquadtextbf{d)} 8qquadtextbf{e)} 27","solution":"1.

For example, the word HHTTH would correspond to the coin flip sequence where the first two flips were heads, the next two were tails, and the last was heads. We are given that exactly three of the five coin flips came up heads, so our word must be some rearrangement of HHHTT.

In the source rectangle R, the cross S is uniquely determined by the position of the center block, and the crosses corresponding to different source rectangles must be different. Moreover, by the definition of the cross, the number of rows and columns of the source rectangle is at least 3; a source rectangle with an even number of rows does not contain a lying cross; a source rectangle with an even number of columns does not contain a standing cross.Now consider the m times n grid P_{m, n}. The number of source rectangles of size (2k+1) times l is (m-2k)(n-l+1), where k, l satisfy3 leqslant 2k+1 leqslant m, 3 leqslant l leqslant n.For each (2k+1) times l source rectangle, the center block of a lying cross must be in the (k+1)-th row and in the 2nd to (l-1)-th columns, so this source rectangle corresponds to l-2 lying crosses.begin{array}{l}text { Hence } A=sum_{k=1}^{left[frac{m-1}{2}right]} sum_{l=3}^{n}(l-2)(m-2k)(n-l+1) =left[sum_{k=1}^{left[frac{m-1}{2}right]}(m-2k)right]left[sum_{i=1}^{n-2} l(n-l-1)right], text { where, } sum_{k=1}^{left[frac{m-1}{2}right]}(m-2k) =left[frac{m-1}{2}right] frac{(m-2)+left(m-2left[frac{m-1}{2}right]right)}{2} quad=left[frac{m-1}{2}right]left(m-left[frac{m+1}{2}right]right), sum_{i=1}^{n-2} l(n-l-1)=left(sum_{l=1}^{n-2} lright)(n-1)-sum_{l=1}^{n-2} l^{2} =frac{(n-2)(n-1)^{2}}{2}-frac{(n-2)(n-1)(2n-3)}{6} =frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} .end{array}Thus, A=left[frac{m-1}{2}right]left(n-left[frac{m+1}{2}right]right) frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}.Similarly, the number of source rectangles of size k times (2l+1) in the grid P_{m, n} is (m-k+1)(n-2l), and each k times (2l+1) source rectangle corresponds to k-2 standing crosses.

Morgane starts by placing m-a tokens, which she chooses to be of colors 1,2, ldots, n, then again 1,2, ldots, n, etc. Thus, she has placed (m-a) / n geqslant n-1 geqslant a tokens of each color, as illustrated below (on the left) in the case where n=5 and m=23.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_12e54482cd1ee5ef6f56g-07.jpg?height=477&width=1254&top_left_y=978&top_left_x=401)Then she chooses a tokens of color m, and inserts a new token of color 1 just between these tokens and the tokens of color 1 that follow, as illustrated above (on the right) in the case where n=5 and m=23: we have drawn in black (with white text) the tokens thus inserted.After proceeding in this manner, Morgane observes that any sequence of n+1 consecutive tokens contains at least n consecutive tokens from the configuration she had obtained before inserting her a extra tokens, and these n tokens are indeed of each of the colors 1,2, ldots, n. As announced, the integer m is therefore well n-colorable.Conversely, suppose that, starting from the integer m=n^{2}-n-1, Morgane was able to achieve her goal. Since m / n<n-1, one of the colors, say color 1, is represented at most n-2 times, and at least once. Morgane isolates a token of color 1, then separates the m-1=(n+1)(n-2) remaining tokens into n-2 groups of n+1 consecutive tokens. Since she is satisfied, each of these groups contains at least one token of color 1: this gives her a minimum of n-1 tokens of color 1 in total, which is absurd!Thus, the integer m=n^{2}-n-1 is not n-colorable, and it is the largest integer that is not n-colorable.Remark: By adapting the reasoning above, we can prove that an integer m is n-colorable if and only if there exist natural numbers k and ell such that m=k n+ell(n+1), that is, if m leqslant(n+1)lfloor m / nrfloor.Comment from the graders The problem consisted of two parts: in one, it was necessary to prove that every integer m geqslant n^{2}-n is of the form a n+b(n+1), and therefore n-colorable; in the other, it was necessary to prove that the integer m=n^{2}-n-1 is not n-colorable. Each of these two parts, taken in isolation, was accessible, but many students only managed to solve one or the other of these parts. In particular, many students, after triumphing over one of the two parts, claimed to reuse their arguments for the other part, but such a strategy almost always failed.Thus, several students found a coloring algorithm for large m, and correctly demonstrated that this algorithm failed for m=n^{2}-n-1, but it would have been conceivable that m=n^{2}-n-1 could be colored in another way. Similarly, some students found a necessary condition on m to be n-colorable, thus proving that m=n^{2}-n-1 is not n-colorable, but nothing indicated that this condition was also sufficient, and therefore that the integers m geqslant n^{2}-n are n-colorable."},{"problem":"During a homework inspection, a school decides to check the homework of students whose student ID numbers end in 5 from each class.

István g. I. o. t.)II. solution. The sum of the angles in question is obtained by subtracting the sum of the interior angles at the vertices J, K, L, M, N of the triangles BJL, CKM, DNL, EMJ, and ANK from the sum of the interior angles of these triangles, which is 5 cdot 180^{circ}. Among these 10 angles, 2 are vertical angles and thus equal, and each is an exterior angle of the common pentagon JKLMN; hence, the above subtraction is equal to twice the sum of these exterior angles.The sum of the interior and exterior angles at each vertex of a common pentagon is 180^{circ}, so the sum of the exterior angles is obtained by subtracting the sum of the interior angles from 5 cdot 180^{circ}. The sum of the interior angles, as is well known, is 3 cdot 180^{circ}, so the sum of the exterior angles is 2 cdot 180^{circ}, and the above subtraction is 4 cdot 180^{circ}. Therefore, the desired sum, the remainder of the subtraction, is 1 cdot 180^{circ} = 180^{circ}.Bárász Péter (Budapest, Fazekas M. gyak. g. I. o. t.)III. solution.

In this way, we need to turn at the vertices A, B, C, D, E by the supplementary angles of alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and varepsilon, respectively, and we complete two full turns. Thus,begin{gathered}180^{circ}-alpha+180^{circ}-beta+180^{circ}-gamma+180^{circ}-delta+180^{circ}-varepsilon=720^{circ} alpha+beta+gamma+delta+varepsilon=180^{circ}end{gathered}Herneczki István (Sopron, Széchenyi I. g.

The answer is (A). Let P_{n} be the probability that the game does not end with the n-th goal (nor before). Suppose that after an odd number (2 k-1) of goals the game is not yet over: the difference in the number of goals scored by the two players is then equal to 1 in absolute value, since it is necessarily odd and cannot be greater than 2. Consider the 2 k-th and the (2 k+1)-th goal: the game ends only if both are scored by the player who was already ahead, which happens with probability 1 / 2 cdot 1 / 2=1 / 4. With probability 3 / 4, instead, after the (2 k+1)-th goal the goal difference will again be equal to 1, and the game will not be over.

Therefore, for the ellipse, the focal length c can be found using c^2 = a^2 - b^2 where a^2 = 10 and b^2 = m. As a result, we get:c^2 = 10 - m. tag{1}For the hyperbola, the focal length c is found using c^2 = a^2 + b^2 where a^2 = 1 and b^2 = b (with b > 0), leading to:c^2 = 1 + b. tag{2}Since the foci are the same for both the ellipse and the hyperbola, setting equation (1) equal to (2), we get:10 - m = 1 + b. tag{3}Now, as P lies on both the ellipse and the hyperbola, we can use its coordinates to set up the additional equations: frac{left(frac{sqrt{10}}{3}right)^2}{10} + frac{y^2}{m} = 1 tag{4} left(frac{sqrt{10}}{3}right)^2 - frac{y^2}{b} = 1. tag{5}From equation (4), we simplify and find an expression relating y^2 and m: frac{10}{9} + frac{y^2}{m} = 1 Rightarrow frac{y^2}{m} = 1 - frac{10}{9} Rightarrow frac{y^2}{m} = frac{-1}{9}. tag{6}Similarly, from equation (5), we find an expression relating y^2 and b: frac{10}{9} - frac{y^2}{b} = 1 Rightarrow frac{y^2}{b} = frac{10}{9} - 1 Rightarrow frac{y^2}{b} = frac{1}{9}. tag{7}Now, using (6) and (7), we have: -m = 9y^2 Rightarrow m = -9y^2 tag{8} b = 9y^2. tag{9}Substituting (8) and (9) into equation (3), we have:10 - (-9y^2) = 1 + 9y^2 Rightarrow 10 + 9y^2 = 1 + 9y^2 Rightarrow 10 = 1.This doesn't make sense unless y^2 = 0, which can't be true since P has a non-zero y-coordinate. We realize that we must solve for y^2 directly from (6) and (7). Using the fact that y^2 must be the same in both equations, we set the ratios equal to each other: frac{m}{-1/9} = frac{b}{1/9} Rightarrow -9m = b. tag{10}Combining (3) and (10), we get two equations:begin{align}10 - m &= 1 + b, -9m &= b.end{align}Solving them simultaneously will give us values for m and b. Substituting b = -9m into the first equation: 10 - m = 1 - 9m Rightarrow 10 - 1 = -9m + m Rightarrow 9 = -8m Rightarrow m = -frac{9}{8},but this would give us a negative value for m, which is not possible since m is supposed to be a squared value (specifically, b^2 for the ellipse). Checking our process, we realize we made an error in the sign when deriving equation (6) from (4). Correcting equation (6), we get: frac{10}{9} + frac{y^2}{m} = 1 Rightarrow frac{y^2}{m} = 1 - frac{10}{9} Rightarrow frac{y^2}{m} = frac{-1}{9}. tag{6}Thus, equation (6) should be: frac{y^2}{m} = frac{1}{9}.Now, knowing the correct signs, let's recalculate m and b:Equating ratios, we have: frac{-1}{9m} = frac{1}{9b} Rightarrow m = b.Substituting this into equation (4), we get: 10 - m = 1 + m Rightarrow m = frac{10 - 1}{2} = frac{9}{2}.But this presents a contradiction, since we were looking for m as a positive integer (since it's squared in the ellipse equation). Therefore, we seek to revisit the problem steps to ensure there is no mistake. Upon further examination, we see that our mistake lies in the way we attempted to combine equaiton (4) and (5). Instead, we should try directly substituting the values into equations (4) and (5): frac{1}{9} + frac{y^2}{m} = 1 Rightarrow frac{y^2}{m} = 1 - frac{1}{9} Rightarrow frac{y^2}{m} = frac{8}{9} Rightarrow y^2 = frac{8}{9}m. tag{6} frac{10}{9} - frac{y^2}{b} = 1 Rightarrow frac{y^2}{b} = frac{10}{9} - 1 Rightarrow frac{y^2}{b} = frac{1}{9} Rightarrow y^2 = frac{1}{9}b. tag{7}From equations (6) and (7), we have: frac{8}{9}m = frac{1}{9}b. tag{11}Substituting equation (11) into equation (3), we get: 10 - m = 1 + frac{8}{9}m Rightarrow 9 = m + frac{8}{9}m Rightarrow 9m + 8m = 81 Rightarrow m = frac{81}{17}.This attempt to solve the problem has led to a value for m that is not an integer. Therefore, we must correct our approach from the start. Looking closely at equations (4) and (5), we see that we improperly transcribed them using the wrong values for the x-coordinate of the point P. Let's correct the transcription using the point Pleft(frac{sqrt{10}}{3}, yright): frac{left(frac{sqrt{10}}{3}right)^2}{10} + frac{y^2}{m} = 1 Rightarrow frac{1}{9} + frac{y^2}{m} = 1 Rightarrow frac{y^2}{m} = 1 - frac{1}{9} Rightarrow frac{y^2}{m} = frac{8}{9} Rightarrow y^2 = frac{8}{9} m. tag{6} left(frac{sqrt{10}}{3}right)^2 - frac{y^2}{b} = 1 Rightarrow frac{10}{9} - frac{y^2}{b} = 1 Rightarrow frac{y^2}{b} = frac{10}{9} - 1 Rightarrow frac{y^2}{b} = frac{1}{9} Rightarrow y^2 = frac{1}{9} b. tag{7}Equating the two expressions for y^2 from equations (6) and (7), we get: frac{8}{9} m = frac{1}{9} b Rightarrow 8m = b. tag{12}Substituting equation (12) into equation (3), we get: 10 - m = 1 + 8m Rightarrow 9m = 9 Rightarrow m = 1. tag{13}Using equation (13) to find b: b = 8m Rightarrow b = 8 times 1 Rightarrow b = 8. tag{14}Finally, the equations for the ellipse and the hyperbola can be expressed as:- For the ellipse: boxed{frac{x^{2}}{10} + y^{2} = 1} (using m = 1).- For the hyperbola: boxed{x^{2} - frac{y^{2}}{8} = 1} (using b = 8)."},{"problem":"SG. 3 The 3 points (1,3),(2,5),(4, a) are collinear.

In the Paris region, fixed telephone numbers consist of the digits 01 followed by eight other digits (for example, 01.99.98.10.00 or 01.00.00.35.77, etc.). To limit accidental calls, it has been decided that if a telephone number is dialed with only one digit wrong, the call will always reach an unassigned number: for example, if 01.99.98.10.00 is assigned, then 01.89.98.10.00 and 01.99.98.10.30 are unassigned. What is the maximum number of different telephone numbers that can be assigned in the Paris region? Justify your answer carefully.## Preliminary RemarksWhen a question asks \\"what is the maximum number of...\\", the proof involves two steps: it is necessary to show, on the one hand, that a certain number can be obtained (often by providing an example), and on the other hand, that it is impossible to obtain more. Perhaps some have thought that the words \\"at most\\" mean that it is only necessary to find an upper bound. This interpretation does not hold: it would have been enough to say (10^8) to solve the problem!The first part was worth 3 points and the second part, 4 points. However, certain gross errors justified a 0 on their own: non-integer or greater than the total number of available numbers, arithmetic operation errors... The ideas are sometimes so confused that pinpointing the exact error is very difficult, especially since there are often several!On the other hand, as long as a copy did not contain a gross error of this kind and contained at least one correct statement (excluding the remark that there are (10^8) numbers in total), it deserved a point. Many believed that since there are 72 ways to make a mistake on a number, no more than one number in 73 could be assigned. This is one of more than thirty different results found in the copies, and it is false because an incorrect number can correspond to several assigned numbers. However, those who made this reasoning but noticed and explained their error (and did not make any other) earned an additional point.Some AdviceBe precise and detailed in your writing. Clearly show the logical structure so that it is clear which arguments support which statements. Always clearly define the objects you are manipulating. Avoid circumlocutions; introduce rather notations and definitions. Be careful with pronouns, \\"this,\\" \\"that,\\" and other ambiguous words. Be careful with \\"in the same way,\\" \\"likewise,\\" \\"by analogy\\"... Each time you write such vague or elliptical formulations, ask yourself two questions. The most important: \\"Am I sure I have a clear idea of what I am writing?\\" And then, \\"Will the grader understand the same thing?\\" But remember: what is well conceived is clearly expressed.When the answer is \\"no,\\" try to detail it. Tell yourself that the more you detail, the more chances you have of catching an error you didn't see and thus obtaining a correct result at the end. In the solution below, deliberately very detailed, absolutely every sentence, and almost every word, serves a purpose. When you write your own,you can skip certain steps in your copy, but certainly not in your thinking.","solution":"## SolutionThe 01 has no importance here; we will therefore drop it and treat the numbers as if they only contained 8 digits. We will say that two numbers are adjacent if they differ in only one position, calling \\"position\\" one of the 8 positions where the digits of a number are located.First, let's show that it is indeed possible to assign 10000000 numbers.Choose the first 7 digits of the number arbitrarily, which represents 10^{7}, or ten million distinct possibilities. To each of these, associate an eighth digit so that the sum of the eight digits is divisible by 10. For example, to 4427667, which satisfies: 4+4+2+7+6+6+7=36, we associate 4 so that (4+4+2+7+6+6+7)+4=40 is divisible by 10, and we decide that among the numbers starting with 4427667, it is 44276674 that will be assigned: this is always possible regardless of the first seven digits. If one and only one of the eight digits is changed, the sum increases or decreases by a difference of two distinct digits, necessarily between 1 and 9. The new sum cannot be divisible by 10, so the obtained number cannot be assigned. This example alone shows that it is possible to assign 10000000 distinct numbers that meet the condition of the problem. And this is not the only example!Now let's show that it is never possible to assign more than 10000000 numbers.## Variant AConsider a set of assigned numbers conforming to the conditions of the problem. Two of them can never have the same digits in the first 7 positions (following the 01), because then these numbers would be adjacent (they would differ only by the last position). Therefore, for each sequence of 7 digits, there is at most one assigned number that starts with this sequence. There are therefore at most 10000000 assigned numbers.## Variant BFirst, we note that each number is adjacent to exactly 72 other numbers. Indeed, consider a number X. If X^{prime} is another number adjacent to X, X^{prime} is entirely determined by the choice of the position i where it differs from X, and the digit that occupies this i-th position, provided that this digit is different from the i-th digit of X (otherwise we would have left.X^{prime}=Xright); conversely, each of these choices provides a number adjacent to X. Since there are 8 positions, and for any chosen position, 9 digits can occupy it, there are therefore 8 times 9=72 possibilities in total.Consider a set of assigned numbers conforming to the conditions of the problem. Let a be the number of assigned numbers, n=10^{8} the total number of numbers. We call m the number of pairs (A, B) where A is an assigned number and B is a number adjacent to it (and therefore not assigned). Estimate m in two different ways:- There are a ways to choose A. According to what precedes, for each value of A, there are 72 ways to choose B. Therefore, m=72a.- There are n-a ways to choose B. Fix the value of B, and choose a position i. Then among the numbers that are adjacent to B by the position i, at most one is assigned (since these 9 numbers are all adjacent to each other). Therefore, there are at most 8 assigned numbers adjacent to B. Note! Nothing allows us to assert a priori that there are exactly 8.But we have m leq 8(n-a). Combining the two conditions, we get: 72a leq 8(n-a), or 80a leq 8n, so a leq frac{n}{10}=10000000."},{"problem":"(11) Given the parabola C: y^{2}=2 p x(p>0) and the moving line l: y=k x+b(k, b are parameters, and k neq 0, b neq 0) intersecting at points Aleft(x_{1}, y_{1}right), Bleft(x_{2}, y_{2}right), with the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system being O, and the slopes of lines O A, O B being k_{O A}, k_{O B} respectively, if k_{O A} cdot k_{O B}=sqrt{3} always holds, then when k varies, the fixed point through which the line l always passes is ( )(A) (-sqrt{3} p, 0)(B) (-2 sqrt{3} p, 0)(C) left(-frac{sqrt{3} p}{3}, 0right)(D) left(-frac{2 sqrt{3}}{3} p, 0right)","solution":"11.

However, the standard solution states that this condition leads to a right triangle. This is based on the assumption that in a right triangle, the angles have specific relationships, but without further context, this statement seems to rely on additional information not provided in the problem statement. Therefore, we accept the given solution's conclusion for the sake of this explanation.- Option B: The condition angle A:angle B:angle C=1:1:2 implies that the angles of the triangle are in a ratio where one angle is twice the size of each of the other two. Since the sum of angles in any triangle is 180^circ, we can set up the equation A+B+C=180^circ. Substituting the given ratio, we get 1x+1x+2x=180^circ, leading to 4x=180^circ, so x=45^circ. This means angle A=angle B=45^circ and angle C=90^circ. Therefore, triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at C.- Option C: The equation b^{2}=a^{2}-c^{2} can be rearranged to a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}. According to the Pythagorean theorem, this condition is satisfied if and only if triangle ABC is a right triangle, with the right angle opposite side a. - Option D: Given the ratio a:b:c=2:3:4, we can express the sides as a=2x, b=3x, and c=4x for some positive real number x. Substituting these into the Pythagorean theorem to check if it holds, we find a^{2}+b^{2}=(2x)^{2}+(3x)^{2}=4x^{2}+9x^{2}=13x^{2}, and c^{2}=(4x)^{2}=16x^{2}. Since a^{2}+b^{2}=13x^{2} neq c^{2}=16x^{2}, the triangle does not satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, and thus, it is not a right triangle.Therefore, the correct answer, which identifies the option that does not describe a right triangle, is (boxed{text{D}})."},{"problem":"Three, (20 points) Find the maximum value of the function f(x)=frac{sqrt{x}}{x^{2}+1}.","solution":"Three, take k>0 ( k is a parameter to be determined), thenbegin{array}{l} f(x)=frac{sqrt{x}}{x^{2}+1}=frac{2 sqrt{k x}}{2 sqrt{k}left(x^{2}+1right)} leqslant frac{x+k}{2 sqrt{k}left(x^{2}+1right)} . text { Let } y=frac{x+k}{x^{2}+1} . text { Then } y x^{2}-x+y-k=0 .end{array}Since the domain of the function f(x) is [0,+infty), equation (2) has a solution in [0,+infty).Thus, Delta=1-4 y(y-k) geqslant 0.Hence y leqslant frac{k+sqrt{k^{2}+1}}{2}.When y=frac{k+sqrt{k^{2}+1}}{2}, Delta=0, at this time, from equation (2) we getx=frac{1 pm sqrt{0}}{2 y}=frac{1}{2 y}=frac{1}{sqrt{k^{2}+1}+k}=sqrt{k^{2}+1}-k .Inequality (1) holds with equality when x=k, and inequality (3) holds with equality when x=sqrt{k^{2}+1}-k.To make the equalities in inequalities (1) and (3) hold simultaneously, we should have k=sqrt{k^{2}+1}-k, solving this gives k=frac{sqrt{3}}{3}.

The vertex represents the minimum value of the function, which is 1.Now, there are two conditions to consider given the range of function f(x) when x in [m, 0]:1. Since the range of f(x) includes its minimum value of 1 when x in [m, 0], the left endpoint m must be less than or equal to the axis of symmetry (x = -2), so the minimum value is included in the interval, i.e., m leq -2.2. Additionally, we need the function to reach 5 within the interval [m, 0]. Setting f(x) to 5, we have      f(x) = (x+2)^2 + 1 = 5 implies (x+2)^2 = 4.      Taking the square root of both sides, we find x+2 = pm2. Hence, x = 0 or x = -4. Since 0 is already the right endpoint of the interval, we only need to ensure that -4 is within or equal to the left endpoint, so m geq -4.Combining both these conditions, we get -4 leq m leq -2. Therefore, the range of values for m is [-4, -2].[boxed{-4 leq m leq -2}]"},{"problem":"6. The set contained weights of 43, 70, and 57 grams, with an equal number of each type.

Let's divide the initial set of weights into triples 43+70+57. In each triple, the total weight is 170 g. Note that no more than 4 cdot 70=280 g has been lost.

In the second case, 228 g have been lost. This is only possible if 4 weights of 57 g have been lost. Indeed, the number of lost 70-gram weights must be even (otherwise, the lost weight would be odd).

This is because the sum of the interior angles is 4 cdot 180^{circ} or 720^{circ} and so each angle is frac{1}{6} cdot 720^{circ} which equals 120^{circ}.Thus, angle D E P=180^{circ}-120^{circ}=60^{circ}, which means that triangle D E P is a 30^{circ}-60^{circ}-90^{circ} triangle.Since D E=2, then E P=1 and D P=sqrt{3}.Since the coordinates of E are (1,0), then the coordinates of D are (1+1,0+sqrt{3}) or (2, sqrt{3}).

To show that the largest integer sought is an integer c, there are therefore necessarily two distinct parts: the analysis, in which it is established that any integer n satisfying the stated property satisfies n geqslant c, and the construction, in which an example of c real numbers x_{1}, ldots, x_{c} in the interval ] -1,1 [ is given, satisfying the two mentioned equalities.Analysis: Let n be the smallest integer satisfying the property stated in the problem and let x_{1}, ldots, x_{n} be real numbers in the interval ] -1,1 [ for whichx_{1}+ldots+x_{n}=0 quad text { and } quad x_{1}^{2}+ldots+x_{n}^{2}=2020First, since x_{i}^{2}-1 for all real i leqslant k, we know that0=x_{1}+x_{2}+ldots+x_{n}>(-k)+x_{k+1}+x_{k+2}+ldots+x_{n}Furthermore, for all i leqslant k, the real number x_{i} belongs to the interval ]-1,0[, so x_{i}^{2}1010, which means k geqslant 1011. Thus, for any non-zero real numbers satisfying the two equalities, there are at least 1011 strictly negative real numbers. Moreover, if left(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n}right) is an n-tuple satisfying the two equalities in the problem, the n-tuple left(-x_{1}, ldots,-x_{n}right) also satisfies the two equalities in the problem. Therefore, there are also at least 1011 strictly positive real numbers. In total, there are at least 2022 real numbers, so n geqslant 2022.Construction: Conversely, we show that n=2022 satisfies the property stated in the problem. The simplest way to do this is to look for a 2022-tuple of the form (x,-x, x,-x, ldots, x,-x) with a well-chosen x. By injecting this 2022-tuple into the right equation, we get 2022 x^{2}=2020, sox= pm sqrt{frac{2020}{2022}}By construction, for such an x, the 2022-tuple (x,-x, x,-x, ldots, x,-x) satisfies both equalities.In conclusion, the smallest integer n satisfying the property stated in the problem is n=2022.Comment from the graders: The problem was very difficult and was solved by only a handful of students. While it was difficult to solve the problem completely, some parts of the proof were nevertheless accessible and could earn many partial points, such as providing a construction for 2022 or showing that n>2022. Thus, even if very few students managed to provide a correct reasoning that proves there are no 2021 real numbers satisfying the two equations, most students who tackled the problem saw these two parts and earned valuable partial points. Being able to scrape partial points without necessarily finding the solution to a problem is an important asset for the olympiads. The key to the problem was to separate the positive real numbers from the negative real numbers and then establish inequalities between the different quantities (using simple majorizations like x^{2} leqslant|x| or even x_{1}+ldots+x_{k}<k) to finally combine them correctly. There were therefore several opportunities to earn additional partial points by establishing one or the other of the intermediate inequalities. We detail here the reasoning encountered and why they do not allow for a conclusion.triangleright We remind that the real numbers belonged to the interval ]-1 ; 1[, meaning they could not take the value pm 1. It is regrettable to see that several students did not take this important detail into account.triangleright Several students claim that a good way to proceed is to pair the real numbers with their opposites, and that therefore n is odd. But of course, just because a practical way to find real numbers is to choose real numbers and their opposites does not mean there is no better way to do it and in particular that there is no solution in the case n=2021. In the same vein, some students claim that in the case where n=2021, there must be three real numbers with a sum of zero, but this is obviously not true.triangleright Many students give very vague reasoning in which the real numbers are taken to the limit at pm 1. But here, we are given an integer n and we assume that there is a solution to the system of two equations with n unknowns, so it does not really make sense to take the real numbers to the limit."},{"problem":"If the radius of circle O is 6 cm, then the length of the longest chord in circle O is     cm.","solution":"Since the radius of circle O is 6 cm,  the diameter of circle O is 12 cm,  which is the length of the longest chord in the circle.

Check all possible pairs of quadratic residues modulo 7:   [   begin{aligned}   &0 + 0 equiv 0 pmod{7}    &0 + 1 equiv 1 pmod{7}    &0 + 2 equiv 2 pmod{7}    &0 + 4 equiv 4 pmod{7}    &1 + 1 equiv 2 pmod{7}    &1 + 2 equiv 3 pmod{7}    &1 + 4 equiv 5 pmod{7}    &2 + 2 equiv 4 pmod{7}    &2 + 4 equiv 6 pmod{7}    &4 + 4 equiv 1 pmod{7}   end{aligned}   ]   The pairs ((a^2 pmod{7}, b^2 pmod{7})) that sum to 2 are ((0, 2)) and ((1, 1)).5. Now, consider the condition (7 mid (a + b)). This means (a + b equiv 0 pmod{7}).6. For the pair ((a^2 equiv 1 pmod{7}, b^2 equiv 1 pmod{7})), (a) and (b) can be (1) or (6 pmod{7}). Therefore, the possible values are:   [   begin{aligned}   &a equiv 1 pmod{7}, b equiv 6 pmod{7}    &a equiv 6 pmod{7}, b equiv 1 pmod{7}   end{aligned}   ]7. For the pair ((a^2 equiv 0 pmod{7}, b^2 equiv 2 pmod{7})), there are no integer solutions since 2 is not a quadratic residue modulo 7.8. Now, we need to find specific values of (a) and (b) that satisfy these conditions. We can try:   [   begin{aligned}   &a = 7k + 1, b = 7m + 6    &a = 7k + 6, b = 7m + 1   end{aligned}   ]   and check if (a^2 + b^2 = 2018).9. Trying (a = 43) and (b = 13):   [   43^2 + 13^2 = 1849 + 169 = 2018   ]   This satisfies the equation (a^2 + b^2 = 2018) and (a + b = 56), which is divisible by 7.10. Similarly, (a = 13) and (b = 43) also works.The final answer is ( boxed{ (a, b) = (43, 13) } ) or ((13, 43))."},{"problem":"7. Let x_{0} be the largest (real) root of the equation x^{4}-16 x-12=0.

Dividing by 0 is one of the most common errors in all algebra and arithmetic papers, and is yet easily avoidable: it must be remedied!triangleright Several students attempt to use inequalities, but quickly find themselves multiplying by b+d without checking the sign of this quantity. Multiplying by a negative number changes the direction of the inequality, so the entire proof falls apart from there. It was possible to reason with inequalities, but this was very laborious, and only one paper did it perfectly.Finally, too many students forget to verify their solutions.

Let's take a point K on NM such that AK | CM, then ACMK is a parallelogram. We will prove that triangles KON and COM are equal by two sides and the angle between them. In triangle AKN, angle N is 60^{circ}, and AK | BC, so triangle AKN is equilateral, hence NK = NA = MC. Point O lies on the axis of the equilateral triangle NBM, so NO = OM. Medians in an equilateral triangle are also angle bisectors, so angle KNO = angle CMO = 30^{circ}.From the equality of triangles KON and COM, it follows that OK = OC and triangle OKC is isosceles. The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other at the point of intersection.

Given Conditions and Initial Observations:   - We are given a function ( f ) mapping the set of positive integers to the set of non-negative integers.   - The function satisfies:     1.

Analyzing Condition (2):   - From ( f(2008) = 0 ), we know that ( f ) evaluated at 2008 is zero.   - Since ( f ) is non-negative, ( f(2008) = 0 ) implies that ( f ) must be zero for any divisor of 2008. This is because if ( 2008 = mn ), then ( 0 = f(2008) = f(m) + f(n) ), and since ( f(m) ) and ( f(n) ) are non-negative, both must be zero.3. Divisors of 2008:   - The prime factorization of 2008 is ( 2008 = 2^3 times 251 ).   - The divisors of 2008 are ( 1, 2, 4, 8, 251, 502, 1004, 2008 ).   - Therefore, ( f(d) = 0 ) for each divisor ( d ) of 2008.4.

Coprime Argument:   - Suppose ( m ) is any positive integer coprime with 2008. Then there exists an integer ( a ) such that ( am equiv 1 pmod{2008} ) (by Bezout's identity).   - Consider ( n = 39a ). Then ( nm equiv 39 pmod{2008} ), so ( f(nm) = f(39a cdot m) = f(39) + f(a) + f(m) ).   - Since ( nm equiv 39 pmod{2008} ), we have ( f(nm) = 0 ). Thus, ( 0 = f(39) + f(a) + f(m) ).   - Given ( f(39) = 0 ) (from condition 3), we have ( 0 = f(a) + f(m) ). Since ( f(a) geq 0 ) and ( f(m) geq 0 ), it follows that ( f(a) = 0 ) and ( f(m) = 0 ).6. General Case:   - If ( m ) is not coprime with 2008, let ( d = gcd(m, 2008) ). Then ( m = da ) where ( gcd(a, 2008) = 1 ).   - We have ( f(m) = f(da) = f(d) + f(a) ).   - Since ( d ) is a divisor of 2008, ( f(d) = 0 ). Also, since ( a ) is coprime with 2008, ( f(a) = 0 ).   - Therefore, ( f(m) = 0 + 0 = 0 ).7.

Gimn., II. o. t.)Note. In the problem statement, some may find the part \\"is there a smallest among the quotients obtained this way\\" somewhat strange, as we are accustomed to the fact that among given numbers, there is always a smallest. However, this is not always the case. For example, there is no smallest integer, rational number, or even real number. There is also no smallest positive rational number: for any positive rational number g, g / 2 is smaller and also a positive rational number. Similarly, if we consider the reciprocals of all natural numbers, there will be no smallest among the resulting quotients. Therefore, it was not superfluous to include this part in the question.But when can we be sure that there is a smallest among certain numbers, what tells us that in a set of numbers, there is definitely a smallest element? Well, this is indicated by the number of elements in the set, the cardinality of the set. If the set contains a finite number of numbers, that is, if we can count the numbers and say how many numbers are in the set (ten, a hundred, etc.), then there is definitely a smallest (and largest as well) among the numbers in the set. However, if the set contains an infinite number of numbers, then it is possible, but not certain, that there is a smallest among the numbers.We would like to draw attention to the fact that in mathematics, the word \\"infinite\\" is not always used in a finite sense. In the above example, a set is finite if we can count its constituent numbers and say how many elements the set contains. A set is infinite if we cannot count its constituent elements, as in the case of integers or real numbers."},{"problem":"Let S be the universal set, and B subset A subset S.

The third unique specimen was a crocodile with a cane. Find the mathematical expectation of the random variable \\"the number of crocodiles with a cane that Leshа had by the time he completed his collection.\\"","solution":"Answer: approximately 3.59.Solution. Let's assume there are a total of n crocodiles in the collection. We will number the exhibits in the order in which they appeared in the collection. For example, the crocodile with glasses was the first, so it is a crocodile of type 1. After some number of attempts, a crocodile of type 2 appeared, which had not been seen before (with a newspaper), and so on.Consider the moment when the k-th crocodile appeared in the collection. We are interested in the expected number of crocodiles of this type that will be purchased before the collection is completed.Starting from the moment when the k-th crocodile appeared, it will take varphi_{k} purchases for the next missing exhibit (number k+1) to appear. The probability that it will appear in each separate attempt is frac{n-k}{n}. Therefore, mathrm{E} varphi_{k}=frac{n}{n-k}, and the number of \\"extra\\" crocodiles that will appear on average ismathrm{E} varphi_{k}-1=frac{n}{n-k}-1=frac{k}{n-k}Of these extra frac{k}{n-k} crocodiles, some (let xi_{k}) belong to type k, and since in each attempt each of the k types of extra crocodiles appears with equal probabilitymathrm{E} xi_{k}=frac{1}{k} cdot frac{k}{n-k}=frac{1}{n-k}Similarly, between exhibits number k+1 and k+2, on averagemathrm{E} varphi_{k+1}-1=frac{n}{n-k-1}-1=frac{k+1}{n-k-1}extra crocodiles will appear, of which on average mathrm{E} xi_{k+1}=frac{1}{n-k-1} belong to type k, and so on.Therefore, the total number X_{k} of extra crocodiles of type k isX_{k}=xi_{k}+xi_{k+1}+xi_{k+2}+ldots+xi_{n-1}and the expected value of this quantity ismathrm{E} X_{k}=frac{1}{n-k}+frac{1}{n-k-1}+ldots+1=H_{n-k}where H denotes the harmonic number: H_{m}=1+frac{1}{2}+frac{1}{3}+ldots+frac{1}{m}.Adding to all these extra crocodiles of type k the first such crocodile (not extra), we find that the average number of such crocodiles is H_{n-k}+1.In the conditions of the problem, n=10, k=3, so the expected number of crocodiles with a cane, that is, crocodiles of type 3, is H_{7}+1 approx 2.59+1=3.59.Remark.

[We are given that n is independent of the points chosen.] Take any point A of the graph. We count the number N of pairs (B, C), where the point B is joined to A, the point C is not joined to A, and the points B and C are joined. For any point C not joined to A, there are just n points joined to C and A. There are 3k+6 points joined to A and hence (12k - 1 - (3k+6) ) = 9k-7 points not joined to A. So N = (9k-7)n. Now given a point B joined to A, it is joined to 3k+5 other points, n of which are also joined to A, so it is joined to (3k+5-n) points which are not joined to A. So N = (3k+6)(3k+5-n). Thus we have: 9k 2 + 33k - 12kn + 30 + n = 0. Hence n = 3m for some integer m and m = (3k 2 + 11k + 10)/(12k - 1), so 4m = k + 3 + (9k+43)/(12k-1). If k ≥ 15, then 0 < (9k+43)/(12k-1) < 1, which would make m non-integral.

Proving 2 Intersections is Impossible:   - Assume for contradiction that there exists a set of four distinct lines ell_1, ell_2, ell_3, ell_4 that intersect at exactly two points X_1 and X_2.   - Without loss of generality, let ell_1 pass through X_1 and ell_2, ell_3 pass through X_2.   - Since neither ell_2 nor ell_3 can intersect ell_1 (as this would create more than 2 intersection points), both must be parallel to ell_1. However, this would imply that ell_2 and ell_3 are parallel to each other, so they can't both pass through X_2, leading to a contradiction.Hence, the possible number of intersection points for four distinct lines in the plane are 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6.The final answer is boxed{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6}."},{"problem":"Example 7 As shown in the figure, in the right triangle triangle ABC, it is known that BC=a.
