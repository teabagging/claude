I have a temporary filling fitted but since my trauma a gap has been created too and the edge of the filling is a little sharp. I must admit, I do feel around in my mouth constantly and often get food trapped in the gap causing the tooth to get inflamed.

Brush your teeth twice daily and rinse your mouth after every meals. Also monitor your blood-sugar level to monitor diabetes mellitus. Include vitamin-c rich fruits into your diet. Take plenty of water and fluids too. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"my tooth is hurting i have a toothache and i took alot of medicine what shoul i do now","Doctor":"Dear friend. Thanks for sharing your concern. Tooth pain arises only when the bacterial invasion occurs and it reaches to dentin and then to pulp. After reaching pulp it causes inflammation and infection to your pulp tissues. Sometimes periapical infection and abscess is also seen in chronic cases. Therefore i would suggest you to visit your dentist soon and get  the concerned tooth examined. So that it can be well diagnosed and suitably treated,without excessive damage due to self medication. Lots of pain killers have diverse side effects too.so please avoid them on regular basis. Hope it helps. Thanks. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello, I had a wisdom extraction about 5 1/2 weeks ago. I was sedated by the IV the dentist inserted in my arm. I noticed my vein had damage which is common from an IV insertion. It was a little hard and of course bruised. I expected the swelling to go down by now. Instead, the lump which is the width of my vein has slowly moved up about half an inch. It has increased in firmnessand aalmost feels like there is a tube almost an inch long in my vein. When I press on the lump it moves and feels like there is an edge to the lump at both ends. I have received bruising after pressing on it. When I bend my arm or flex my bicep it feels like its pushing against my bicep. I am a phlebotomist and draw blood mainly on geriatrics for 7 years. I've seen veins with scar tissue and hematoma, but never anything like this. Also my veins are very prominent. Could there be debris or something left behind from the IV?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for asking the query, Your clinical history suggest that you had developed a sweeling at the injected side of your arm which you are feeling as haematoma. If you are comfortable with your day to day activities it is advisable to apply a bandage at the side, so that the haematoma resolves faster. If the skin over the haematoma is showing any signs of unhealthiness, its better to consult a physician and get the checkup done. Follow the post operative instructions given by the Dentist properly. Maintain a good oral hygiene. Hope this helps out. Regards.."},{"Patient":"I went to the dentist 2 days ago due to pain/itching in the gums between my implant and molar. The onset of the pain was 3 days prior to my appointment. The implant was done 2 years ago and I had this same pain at one point during the process for which the dentist prescribed an antibiotic and it resolved.  The night before my appointment, I noticed my gums were painful in my entire mouth (something I've never experienced).  The morning of my appt, my gums were so painful that I mentioned I wanted to forgo the routine cleaning I was to have in addition to having my dentist check the gum pain at my implant.  My x-ray proved no infection at the implant and I had the cleaning.  I have very little plaque buildup and take very good care of my teeth regularly.  My dentist mentioned enamel wear due to bruxism but didn't feel it necessary to prescribe a splint.  Since the exam and cleaning 2 days ago, my gums are so painful that brushing and flossing are very painful as well as eating.  I woke from sleep at 2 am and my gums were extremely painful and it was excruciating to clench my teeth together.  The teeth pain was a new symptom.  In the 2 hours that I've been awake, the tooth pain has greatly subsided, but the gum pain remains.  Also, my submanibular lymph nodes on both sides are very tender.  I see no rash or discoloration in my gums/mouth.  One last comment:  I consumed about 10-15 sugar-free mints the evening prior to my dentist appt.  I had never had them before.  I'm wondering if the sudden whole-mouth gum pain could be an allergic reaction to them.  Thank you for your help.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for asking the query, For succesful placement of Dental implants the periodontium and the supporting structures like gums, alveolar bone should be healthy.

I woke up this morning with pus draining from a small hole in my upper gum line very close to my upper jaw bone/ joint . I can push on my cheek and it flows out in a thick very smelly line. I don t have any teeth on this side...just a bridge and it is anchored to my front teeth. My sinus on this side has been creating misery and when I look down my nose...my cheek clearly is extended. I have had sinus surgery in the past but it was over 15 years ago and most of this side has been removed. I was in a car accident that caused me to break every bone in my face...jaw was 14 fractures all by itself. I am now completely terrified of any problem because I just want to be normal...pain free and no more problems! Now this...should I be alarmed by this or could pus be a really bad sinus infection and draining thru my mouth is the only path it can go. Thank you for your help...if you can.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for asking he query, As you have mentioned you have bridge on the affected side, due to poor oral hygiene and food lodgement there can been inflammation of the surrounding tissues and abscess formation.

Get the abscess drained by the Dentist. Go for scaling, polishing and curettage at the required site. Take a course of tab Augmentin 625 mg , tab acecolofenac serratiopeptidase thrice for 3-5 days .

In this problem, there is laxity of the junction between our food pipe and the stomach, that leads to acid refluxing up in to the food pipe from the stomach. The diagnosis is usually made from clinical symptom and an endoscopy.  Most patients get good relief in symptoms from medications: acid suppressants and prokinetic agents. There are several of them available in the market and your doctor can prescribe you the same. In addition, there is a big role of life style changes which I strongly advocate. Some of these include:  *avoiding hot, spicy and fatty meals  *Instead of large meals at one go, take small frequent meals  *Do not lie down within an hour of your last meal  *Elevate head end of your bed by a brick  *Avoid cola beverages, nuts, chocolates  *No smoking and alcohol  *Weight reduction for those who are overweight  I am sure that with above measures coupled with medications, you can get good relief in your symptoms."},{"Patient":"I have my wisdom tooth for 8 years now.

Pain and difficulty in opening the mouth are the sings of Temporomandibular joint problems. TMJ problems may arise due to altered biting habits may lead to pain in front of ears. This makes mouth opening, biting and swallowing difficult. Teeth grinding habit often alters the biting habit and leads to occlusal disharmony. Exact diagnosis can be made only after clinical examination. So please visit a dentist and get the evaluation done. You may need an OPG radiograph done for you, which will help in ruling out the problem. Accordingly treatment can be planned. i hope this helps , take care."},{"Patient":"Pain, swollen gums and feels like a blister in space where right bottom molar was (extracted 9 years ago).

They went down bout a day later but right behind the front two teeth is VERY painfull and soar. Makes it hard to eat, almost feels like a cut or something. Do you have any idea what that is?","Doctor":"hello there , TMJ problems can be associated primarily with the pain and soreness in the upper front teeth and swollen gums as you have mentioned .

Invisalign (and similar brands) are becoming more and more popular. Instead of brackets and wires, the Invisalign system consists of a series of plastic retainer-like trays that you wear for short periods of time to gradually correct tooth alignment. While braces are usually the best option for major dental corrections, Invisalign can be a much more comfortable and faster option.

I HAVE A BIG GAP BETWEEN MY FRONT UPPER TWO TEETHS. WHAT ARE THE TECNIQUE AND APPROX COST FOR FILLING THIS GAP? THANK YOU.","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for writing to us. A diastema is a space or gap between two teeth. It appears most often between the two upper front teeth. However, gaps can occur between any two teeth. Sometimes, a diastema is part of a set of problems that require orthodontic treatment. If you want it done in one visit, then bonding is the way to go. Bonding is considered a permanent material, but that doesn't mean it will never need to be redone, it most likely will at some point. Orthodontics might be the best choice, but it takes longer and will be more expensive, people get braces, which move the teeth together. Often, no matter where the diastema is, you must wear a full set of braces — on both your upper and lower teeth. That's because moving any teeth affects your entire mouth. Wishing you good health...

The pain has been okay but this morning they were extremely swollen and bleeding . My whole jaw is sore to talk or eat, is this something I should worry about? I also have an appointment sometime next week to go to the dentist to see when we could extract them.","Doctor":"Hello, I am Dr.Neha Gupta (dentist) and am glad to address to your query here. The most common cause of pain from impacted tooth is the inflammation in the soft tissue covering over the offending tooth(Pericoronitis), mostly caused by food impaction in the soft tissue space over the tooth and/or bite injury over the soft tissue covering the impacted tooth, by upper molar tooth. As your third molar has remote possibility to be erupted in the mouth(as cover by bone and no space to be be erupted) the symptom like pain may frequently appear. The Third molar has no function for mastication(chewing) or maintaining occlusion, so it is always better to extract the tooth when it starts causing problem. In an experienced surgeons hand your impacted tooth can easily be extracted without causing much problem. You may have a mild pain and facial swelling for couple of days after extraction( as some amount of bone is to be removed) and you can also join to your work in couple of days. Take care and please keep me informed of your progress at healthcaremagic through my profile directly.

Do not worry if your dentist has examined thoroughly and suspects pus in your oral cavity then she must have drained them too.Any pus anywhere in oral cavity should be drained well before further treatment. Also you have already started with your antibiotic dosage due to heart murmur,so even if there is any infection and pus remaining, your sufficient dosage of antibiotic will help in this case. just take your medication properly in this case. Now the blister that you would have seen could be pitting edema(swelling after extraction which generally occurs).

Pimple you can notice is nothing but the abscess draining in the oral cavity that needs to be drained and compressed in position followed by a course of antibiotic and analgesic will subside the symptoms. once the abscess is drained the infected tooth can be treated by root canal procedure to devitalise it permanently . get an x ray done the affected area and approach a dentist for the treatment. i hope this helps, take care."},{"Patient":"I have been diagnosed with a tooth infection.

Deep dental caries,periodontitis,pericoronitis due to impacted wisdom teeth all these can cause pus accumulation and discharge. Since you are pregnant,your gums will be tender,soft causing gingivitis. So the abscess has to be diagnosed and curetted. Decayed teeth can be restored.

Could it be some sort of bacteria under my teeth?","Doctor":"HI ROCKYY, Thanks for posting your query. The foamy liquid is due to the abscess formed at the periapical area of involved tooth. The pus usually contains bacteria. I would suggest you get the tooth either root canal treated or extracted depending on the condition of tooth. Take complte course of antibiotics too. The sour taste will disappear once the pus drains out completely. Maintain good oral hygiene. Please get the treatment soon as it can lead into sinus infection if left untreated. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello. I m a 26 year old female who is, overall, in very good health. I had a root canal done on tooth number 29 about ten years ago after an injury to the tooth. All seemed well until I noticed a swelling under this tooth a few weeks ago that hurt when pressed. I immediately called the dentist and was seen the next day. The dentist did an X-ray and I was told I had an abscess . She prescribed me 150mg Clindamycin over ten days for the infection and referred me to an endodontist. The endodontist retreated the root canal a couple weeks later and seemed happy with his work. A few hours after the retreated root canal tooth became horribly painful and I noticed some swelling. That night, swelling continued to intensify and spread to my cheek, but pain subsisted. I called my endodontist and he said that this was a flare-up of my old infection and I needed a called a 24-hour pharmacy to get me a prescription amoxicillin (500mg). The next day I went to the endodontist office and they had to make an incision to reduce some of the swelling and allow the abscess to drain. I was also given a prescription for metronidazole (500mg) to take in addition to the amoxicillin. Thankfully the swelling in my cheek subsisted gradually and now a week later my face looks normal, however I still have a fair amount of swelling and tenderness in my gum under the retreated root canal and my jaw hurts a little. Every time I call the endodontist the receptionist tells me to call back in a few days because the swelling should be gone and every few days when I call the swelling remains the same and yet I am told to call back again in a few days...very frustrating and worrisome. My questions are as follows, how long should it realistically take for the swelling and tenderness in my gum under my tooth to go away? Is there any chance of this infection spreading to my cheek again as I am now finished with my antibiotics? Should the tooth be treated again or possibly extracted? When they open the area again to permanently seal the root canal or do any other work is there a possibility of the infection spreading again? Thanks!","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to hcm forum, Since you got the re-rct for a traumatically injured tooth,chance of root fracture/spread of infection into adjacent tissue spaces has to be ruled out. Usually the pain and swelling after access opening and pulp extirpation lasts for 2 weeks. As the pain remains, in your case the tooth has to be checked for any fracture or infected pulp remaining within the pulp canal. If required,adjacent teeth also has to be root canal treated. If the symptoms persists,get it extracted. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"My mom is having this oosing white liquid coming out of her gums behind her top front teeth .

There are a number of possible causes of pain after the completion of a root canal. After a root canal is completed no living pulp tissue remains inside the tooth, but nerve endings remain in the ligaments that attach the tooth to the surrounding bone. These ligaments have nerve fiber associated with them that can feel pain. They are the source of any post root canal pain. visit the dentist and get an IOPAR done and plan yor reatment according to that.

There may be pain for a little while once a patient gets a denture for the first time until such a time the mouth gets adjusted to them. Denture pain frequently happens when the dentures produce sore spots, which are caused by the loosening or the rubbing of dentures on the gums. The gum ridge may tighten up because of the absence of teeth. A mild herbal mouthwash is the best solution for sensitive mouths. Good hygiene will also go a long way to soothe tender gums.

Based on what you have stated, I would like to ask a few more questions for a proper answer. -Does the sensitivity leave within a few seconds from when the cold leaves the tooth? if so, then most likely the sensitivity is due to exposed root which is common.  The best way to reduce this sensitivity is to use Sensodyne or another antisensitive toothpaste.  You have to use this two-three times a day religiously for 3-4 weeks for it to START working.  You brush your teeth for two full minutes, spit out the excess, do not rinse out the film, do not eat or drink for 30-60 minutes.  This gives it time to work.  It takes weeks for it to gradually start working but you will notice the difference. -Does the sensitivity persist for 15-45 seconds or longer after removal of the stimulus? if so then your dentist is right, you need root canal therapy because you have irreversible pulpitis. The composite is most likely to help close the gaps to make your teeth more aesthetic. Best wishes and good health Dr. Ward"},{"Patient":"thankyou.

He x-rayed my molar and found it to be a perfectly healthy tooth, no decay or sign of it so far... He suggested that he thought my wisdom tooth coming through at the same side was putting pressure on the other teeth as it forces it s way through, this making my molar sensitive to bite on.

Decay, a loose filling/crown and/or a cracked tooth are possible causes.See a dentist to diagnose the problem before the pain worsens. Decay will need to be removed, and a loose filling/crown replaced by your dentist. If the pain is caused by pulp tissue damage, your dentist may send you to an endodontist, a specialist who will perform a root canal treatment to clean out the damaged pulp, disinfect the root canal and fill and seal the remaining space to save the tooth. A cracked tooth may be difficult to treat not only if it involves the pulp, but also depending on the location and depth of the crack. With out seeing the Xray's and doing the clinical examination it is difficult to diagnose."},{"Patient":"My dentist last March 7 did a cut on my both gums because my gums overlapped on my molar.

Thanks for sharing your concern.

Also,could you please explain what do you mean by, lost the sharpness of taste? because this shows that you are taking about numbness in tongue? you can take vitamin b supplements for 15 days and observe the changes.

My nose was alittle swollen, the dentist injected injected an antibiotic during root canal, the following day I blew my nose when the mucus came out it was thicker then usual and noticed it kind of looked like rubber glue. When looking into my nose I noticed a white patch in there and my nostril looks swollen. I ve recently been on antibiotics for sinus infection after getting Cat Scan and seeing an ear nose and throat doctor, but before all this happened I had pain on the right side of my face in the jawbone area underneath my ear doctors thought it was mastiod, bone infection and turned out not to be. Cat Scan did determine I had mucus and sinusitis. my question iscould the white patch on my nostrils be sinusitisor the antibiotics that the dentist inject in my tooth and gums.","Doctor":"Dear friend. Thanks for sharing your concern. Your history requires little more clarity, you  have mentioned that  you got root canal treatment done. This is done  to treat a tooth which has involved the pulp and periapical area. It is not done for gum swelling. The cause for your gum swelling is the abscess, which was due to infected tooth. Your dentist has injected local anesthetic  to relieve pain during root canal treatment procedure. Its effect last for few hours only, this will not lead to sinusitis. Please mention which tooth are you talking about ? is it your upper left side first molar? Here i would like to mention that if this is the tooth on which RCT has been done, then in rare chances it can lead to oro antral fistula. The white patch and mucus thicker than usual could be the result of this. For this i would suggest you to revisit your dentist for clinical evaluation. Have you mentioned to your dentist about your recent sinusitis and the antibiotics that you were  taking prior to dental treatment? Your  pain underneath your ear on right side  is not related to this. It could be due to impacted tooth in the lower jaw or a periapical infection on right side , for this you must get an xray done to rule out any impaction or infection. . Hope i have answered your query. Thanks. Take care."},{"Patient":"firstly i bited my cheek once due to which white patch developed and its not healing , also i started bad breath, feel heaviness on left cheek , sometimes feel left face is swallen...dont know but only thing coming in my mind is i am having cancer ....i have shown to ENT and dentist and they said its ok and nothing of that sort but still i have doubts and its not going from my mind","Doctor":"Dear friend. Thanks for sharing your concern. when you have already visited ENT doctor and dentist, and they have suggested you that it is not cancer then you should be relaxed,that it is not cancer. Now i would like to ask you why do you feel it is cancer? it has no such signs and  symptoms,which could be correlated to cancer. you have already mentioned that it has arised from the self induced injury to cheek. now the symptoms, that you are experiencing  like  swelling and heaviness that is just due to tissue injury and inflammation. once the tissue repairs or heals you will feel absolutely normal.Also you must avoid this habit further. Regarding your bad breath, that is due to improper oral hygiene or chronic sinusitis.You must rule out these too. use antiseptic mouth wash for 15 days twice daily and look for the changes.

I m hoping it is not an infection and just some type of canker soar that will heal on its own.. what do you think?","Doctor":"Hello, I am Dr.Neha Gupta (dentist) and am glad to address to your query here. Options are plenty when it comes to clearing mouth blisters but first it is necessary to find out the underlying cause. in most cases, mouth blisters is not a serious issue and many times vanish without any treatment. Eating spicy and hot foods can aggravate the pain associated with mouth blisters. Hence, staying away from these food items is important to ensure that mouth blisters last only for a short while. Including less spicy and salty foods in the diet may prevent recurrence of mouth blisters. In case, vitamin B12 deficiency is diagnosed, taking vitamin supplements may help to clear mouth blisters. Cold sores that appear around the mouth may be treated with topical ointments On the other hand, antibiotic treatment at the earliest is the key to get rid of syphilis. Mouth blisters remedies like rinsing the mouth with Neem water or water containing zinc can work wonders to alleviate the pain and shrink the mouth blisters. As turmeric displays antiseptic properties, it can also be helpful to cure mouth blisters. Prepare a solution by adding turmeric in boiling water. Once the boiling water returns back to room temperature, rinse the mouth with the solution to get rid of blisters.

Poor fitting is generally the cause of most denture wearers' problems. Dentures fit over the bony ridge of your gum and bone. It may take some time for new dentures to be adjusted properly to fit exactly where they need to be. It will also take some time for you to become accustomed to the feel of your dentures. During this transition time it is quite common to develop mouth sores. Keep your dentures clean to avoid bacteria build up. Make a mouthwash using aniseed and peppermint leaves to relieve denture pain Gargle with salt water two or three times a day to prevent mouth sores from getting infected and ease denture pain. Give your mouth a rest. Be sure to remove your dentures for at least six hours every day. Have your dentures checked once a year, relined every two to three years, and replaced every five to six years.

On the same side of flesh that lays against my lower teeth . They aren t particularly painful unless my teeth put pressure on them by biting my lower lip, and I believe they might be from my actual teeth cutting into my lip. Admittedly, the teeth on my lower jaw are pretty jagged and not very straight. The cuts just sort of look like precise deep-ish indents that are colored red or dark pink, much darker than the rest of my inner lip. They are only visible if I pull my lower lip down to see the innermost side of the lip.","Doctor":"DEAR FRIEND. Thanks for sharing your concern. your history suggests that the cuts inside your lower lip is due to the traumatic bite caused from crowded lower(anterior) front teeth. For temporary relief,you can apply gel on the affected area( dologel). For permanent relief,please visit your orthodontist and get appliance to correct your Mal aligned teeth. If the cuts persists,it can lead to ulceration and canker sore too. meanwhile you can take capsules becosules for 15 days. also maintain very good oral hygiene, as Crowding of teeth also results in plaque accumulation and thereby gingivitis . hope it helps thanks."},{"Patient":"hi i have major tooth problems and am in desperate need of care but unfortunately i am a victim of domestic violence and am all messed up from my bf beating me up on a regular basis for over four years ....im unemployed because i hav a hole in my back and need back surgery so any money i get i have to use for dr visits and pain meds","Doctor":"DEAR FRIEND.

I would hold off on smoking a cigarette for at least two weeks from the time of the extraction.  As a health care provider I would encourage you to quit smoking before the time of the appointment to help reduce the risk of post operative complications, and to remain that way. Your body heals by forming a blood clot which is a matrix for the healing tissue and bone to form on.  Cigarettes affect this in many ways, the suction you form on the cigarette itself can pull the clot from the socket and cause dry socket.  The smoke is hot and irritating which can cause pain, delayed healing and also dry socket.  The chemicals in cigarettes causes vasoconstriction, since the mouth heals through microvasculature, vasoconstriction can cut blood supply to the healing site and delay the healing or even cause failure of the clot from progressively healing leading to once again:  dry socket.  I have to disagree with Dr. Rajinder Bajoria, there are plenty of documented and well researched correlations between smoking and complications post oral surgery. Healing of the socket typically takes a good two weeks.  But remember it takes a year for the healing to really succeed.  There are documented cases of people developing infections in their third molar sites a year from the time of the surgery.  The initial healing is what most people notice which is within the first few weeks.  The rest goes undetected. Best Wishes and good health Dr. Ward"},{"Patient":"i had my wisdom teeth removed almost 2 weeks ago, and on friday i went into the office to get my dry sockets packed.

After that, take a small gauze piece on which you can put iodoform paste OR zinc eugenol paste and slowly place it in the extracted socket. Place it loosely and not very tightly in the socket.as it will get hardened and difficult to remove later.

I am sure at my last dental visit when having X-ray for root canal that I seen a horizontal tooth, could this be the problem, do I need to see another dentist?","Doctor":"Pimple on gums can be because of gingival abscess which can occur because of impaction of foreign objects such as tooth brush bristles or some hard food stuff on gums or can occur because of periodontal abscess which occurs because of spread of inflammation from gums to the periodontal tissues. Bump on gums can also occur because of infected tooth adjacent to the gums. Abscess or infection if present in the tooth can move from tooth to bone and surrounding tissues and can cause bump on gums. It might be a canker sore. If bump on gums is because of gingival abscess, then the cause of abscess is removed. Drainage can be established with warm saline rinses 3-4 times a day. If pimple on gums is because of periodontal abscess, then scaling, root planning is done. Periodontal surgery may or may not be required. If bump on gums is because of infected tooth, then root canal treatment of infected tooth is done to remove the infection. If it is a canker sore, then it will heal on its own in 7-10 days.

Roots of upper teeth are close to the sinus and mouth sinus communication could have occurred during tooth extraction. This complication is more common when teeth project into sinus when there is considerable bone present between floor of sinus and root apices. In most cases, opening which occurs is small and blood clot filling the extraction socket will close the openings unless the sinus is infected. If opening is of considerable size, then sutures are placed across the socket to approximate gingival tissues.  Some absorbable material may also be used. Large openings can be closed with buccal flap.

Wisdom teeth are last teeth to come and it is difficult to clean till the wisdom teeth so wisdom teeth are more susceptible to infections. If wisdom tooth is partially impacted, then flap of gum tissue is created in partially erupted tooth in which food impaction can occur and can lead to soreness and swelling. If there is acute infection present in relation to partially impacted wisdom tooth, then debridement of area, operculectomy that is surgical removal of flap is done. If the condition recurs, then extraction of wisdom tooth is required. You can do warm saline rinses 3-4 times a day to reduce the swelling and avoid any food accumulates in the area which can aggravate the swelling. You can take some otc anti-inflammatory pain med for some relief. If pain and swelling doesn’t regress, then you can visit your dentist for evaluation.

If tooth is broken, then you need treatment for your broken tooth. If nerve of the tooth is not exposed, then tooth can be restored with dental filling or crown but if nerve of the tooth is exposed or necrosed, then root canal treatment followed by dental crown is required for the tooth. If tooth is badly mutilated, then post and core procedure is required after root canal therapy. If broken tooth is unrestorable, then tooth extraction followed by replacement of missing tooth with dental implants or dental bridge is required. Only pain meds will be of little help. Hot compresses are not indicated as they will aggravate the swelling. You can do warm saline rinses to reduce the swelling.You need to get treatment done for infected tooth.

If an abscess is formed, post root canal pain can be relieved temporarily by providing drainage, but the treatment will more probably have to be repeated I hope this information has been both informative and helpful Regards"},{"Patient":"Yesterday I had 2 cavities replaced (I had 30+yr old ones) . I had a needle for numbing. Later that night I became extremely itchy. But I couldn t relieve it with scratching bc I was frozen in the area still. So I rubbed it (probably too much as now I have like a wind- burn , scabby rash on the area. This morninng I woke up to a blood filled pillow (even with sticky clot-like stuff) My ear had been bleeding all night. (same side as the work I had done) I went to ER and they said no ruptures. I haven t been sick. I was in the ER for 3 mins..they said if it is still bleeding in 2 days come back so they can burn it. So online I am coming to the conclusion that it may have been a broken blood vessel in my ear from an alergic reaction to something the dentist use (laytex, needles, whatever). My question: 1) What should I be asking my dentist? (i.e. precautions for next time? Is there an x-ray he can do to see if there s anything else wrong -- like Ear cancer?? 2) Is it possible he made an error with respect to the needle??","Doctor":"Hi.. Thanks for posting your query. As you said,you have got your decayed teeth filled under local anaesthesia. Usually,filling of decayed teeth does not require local anaesthesia. In your case,the decay has involved pulp/periapical area resulting pain sensation. The ear pain and bleeding may or may not be associated with filling undertaken. An x-ray will help to rule out the lesion/anomaly underlying. Any perforation/ledge formation during the procedure can cause such bleeding.Needle breakage during LA administration can cause complication. I would suggest you to visit a dentist as well as an ENT specialist regarding this. Hope this helps.

As you c/o bleeding while brushing teeth,your gums may be highly inflammed,ie,gingivitis.

Improper brushing techniques. First of all I want to tell you that please do not be panic regarding dental treatments. If your dentist is doing any procedure,which will be painful,then surely he/she will administer local anaesthetic solution. Meanwhile,brush your teeth twice daily in proper manner.

Is it dangerous?","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for your questions. First cavities are caused by bacterial infections in your teeth.  The bacteria produce acids that eat away at the outer surface of your teeth (enamel) and then spread to the inside of your teeth. Cavities are prevented by: -decreasing frequency of sugar intake, especially sticky, tacky snacks -avoiding beverages high in caffeine, sugar and acids: coffee, energy drinks, fruit drinks, sports drinks -following the 3-2-1 rule:  brush 3 times a day, floss 2 times and gargle with Listerine 1 time daily -do not sip on soda pops or fruit drinks, drink them and then switch to water, the longer you spend sipping on a soda the more exposure you have to acids that eat away at your teeth. -go to the dentist annually and have a cleaning twice a year. -if you have cavities get them fixed right away before they progress and become worse. The hole in your tooth is called a cavity.  The gums growing into the hole is called hyperplastic overgrowth.  You are having an irritation in the area, the gums are swelling and growing due to this issue and filling in the void of your tooth. If the cavity is in the top of the tooth, you may actually have hyperplastic pulp also known as a pulp polyp. You need to have the cavity filled, possibly a root canal and crown, or an extraction of the tooth depending on how bad the hole is. This is not necessarily dangerous, but could lead to more discomfort and a more severe infection down the road.  Don't sit on this until it becomes painful, have it repaired and addressed as soon as you can.

Do not directly brush the extraction site for the first 3-4 days after surgery to prevent dislodging of the blood clot from the socket. You are required to make a post-op appointment in one week to check on the healing of this area.  If sutures were placed they will be removed at this time.

The options though for you is not only extraction. Before deciding on extraction an endodontist has to be consulted and opinion has to be taken whether root canal treatment can be re done. In that case the present filling what has been done will be removed and the root canals would be prepared again and new filling will be done. If retreatment cannot be done, which may be due to various reasons like perforated canal, fractured root, periodontal (gum) problem etc., then extraction has to be done. I recommend you to consult an good endodontist before going for extraction.

Inflammation around wisdom tooth is because it may be impacted And infected.since wisdom tooth does not carry any function in our mouth its an extra tooth and since in your case its getting infected i would also advice you to extract it. You can increase your mouth opening by doing an excercise of slowly opening your mouth twice daily .you may even try keepin a small stick in between yoir upper and lower teeth that will hold your mouth open.

The pain is also relieved by tipping my head upside down, I have no idea why, should I seek emergency care?","Doctor":"hello and welcome, Your clinical symptoms suggest you may have severe periondontal infection . It is caused due to gingival inflmmation and accumulation of granulation tissue deep in the gum pockets which leads to pain in the gums , pressure sensation in the jaws , redness and bleeding gums. i would suggest you to consult a dentist and get an OPG radiograph done which will show the picture of damaged tissues , amount of bone loss , level of alveolar bone and gums .

This swelling of jaw is very painful and patient is unable to open the mouth.It is not always that wisdom teeth causes problems but if they are impacted they can be really dreadful and if ignored they can cause several complications ranging from gum diseases, decay and damage of other teeth. So getting the treatment for wisdom teeth is very important and the treatment is extraction of wisdom teeth.In addition to this, you must be open with your dentist regarding any reservations that you may have about the procedure. You have to discuss the dangers as well as the advantages of doing the procedure. Furthermore, you also have to decide whether you feel that the procedure would be good for you. After the discussion, if you are still not satisfied with all the information that the doctor gave you, it is best to have a second opinion about the matter."},{"Patient":"For the last 7 years I ve notice my bottom teeth doesn t line up with my top teeth. Is there a reason why my teeth is changing? I m 27 and I ve only had one wisdom tooth pulled out but my other three are coming in. However, I feel that it may not be because of my wisdom tooth. When I move my jaw slightly to see how my teeth would look lined up my smile becomes straight as well. Is this something that will need jaw surgery or would invisalign or braces help?","Doctor":"HELLO AND WELCOME, As per the details,I feel you have got a prognathic mandible/retrognathic maxilla. The teeth will get malaligned due to the force of wisdom teeth eruption too. Usually orthodontic appliances are used to treat such cases. If there is prognathic mandible,orthognathic surgery is necessary for normal occlusion. The clinical diagnosis can be interpreted using radiological examination like  OPG. Based on that treatment can be planned. hope this helps."},{"Patient":"hi, i had a bridge (permanent cap) for three missing teeth for 12 yrs and recently popped off. No pain involve. My dentist told me i needed a new porcelain bridge and before that can be done he needs to build-up on one tooth structure because it broke and he said my gum had receeded-the reason the bridge popped off (nothing to hold onto). Is getting a new porcelain permanent bridge the only option. He has not mentioned any option. Thanks","Doctor":"dear friend. thanks for sharing your concern. i think whatever your dentist has suggested is right. when an old bridge pops off , it breaks some tooth structure  also with it. exactly  the same as happened in your case. in that case it cannot be cemented back on the previous location. The broken tooth has to be rebuilt so that it can support the crown and bridge placed on it. I would suggest you to take a x ray and check for bone support around these teeth,if there is adequate bone support and your medical conditions are favourable, then you can go for implants also. Treatment with implants is little costlier than bridge.you will have to check with your oral surgeon regarding its placement,duration and durability. hope it helps . thanks"},{"Patient":"hello doctor , i m a 23 years old female . i am asking about dental local anesthesia i have to get all my teeth filled and crowned , i have been using anesthesia for 7 months nw with approximately 2 injections per week. at the beginning it was going fine but during the past three weeks i am feeling very dizzy and fainting all the time and this feeling increases on the day i visit my dentist . i would like to know if repetitive doses of anesthesia for a long period of time is dangerous and could cause me further problems . thank you","Doctor":"dear friends,thanks for sharing your concern,local  anesthetic (LA) will temporarily  interrupt conduction when absorbed into the nerve. a blockade of afferent nerve transmission produces anesthesia and lack of all sensations. blockade of those fibers transmitting pain , sensation only results in regional analgesia.the perception of heat cold and pressure are abolished by higher concentration of anesthetic agent then are required for interruption for pain.the local anesthetic produces loss of function in following order, pain , temperature, proprioception and skeletal muscle tone .the return  sensation in the reverse order is expected.some times patient under the effect of anesthesia traumatize  their tongue cheek or lips for this reason  longer acting agents may be contra indicated.remember the local anesthetic solution are eventually absorbed in to the general circulation and can have toxic manifestation in overdosage.yes repipititive usage of local anaesthesia have too many side effects like syncope,muscle trismus,haematoma,and adverse effects on CNS(central nervous system),and CVS(Cardio vascular system.therefore i would suggest, minimal usage of anaesthesia is best,if required post treatment analgesics could be prescribed.please donot be apprehensive about dental treatment.if required you can take anti anxiety agents like alprazolam.hope this helps.thanks."},{"Patient":"I had a cole sore develop a week ago and then started to get flu like symptoms, sore throat shooting aches and pains, extreme headache and fever, recently the gums surrounding my two front teeth have become swollen, what does this mean?

Sometimes it s bad enough to take pain medication and other times it is not. 3 days after I had it done i needed panadine forte for two days to cope with the pain. I now have a funky taste in my mouth and my tounge has a thick fur covering it. My taste has gone a little and I have been getting headaches . I should mention the extraction took 1hr and 40 minutes. The dentist had to cut into my gum and eventually removed the tooth in 11 pieces. It was very traumatic!! I have been flushing it every day even using a syringe to make sure I get all the food out as the hole is very deep. Is it normal after such a bad extraction to have this pain still? I should also mention my stitches came out the day after the tooth was pulled and I had to go ba k and get new stitches which also came out the next day. Any advises or ideas on of this is normal or should I go back to the dentist or wait it out another few days. Thanks so much.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to the forum. Well, the healing process truly depends on each person. This will give you time to rest, deal with any pain you might have, and to heal properly (assuming no difficulties arise after the extraction). Also, when you get a tooth pulled, you will have a blood clot that will form in the pocket of where the tooth once was (this is what SHOULD happen). The blood clot is VITAL to the healing process. For a week or two, you need to be careful. Do not drink from a straw, smoke cigarettes, or drink hot fluids. This can cause the blood clot to come out and create what is called a \\"dry socket\\" which can be EXCRUCIATINGLY painful. You CAN drink warm fluids, just not hot. If you happen to be a smoker, try to cut down as much as you can. If you smoke a cigarette, take a piece of gauze, cut off a strip, fold it in half, and tuck it up where the tooth was pulled. This will at least be SOME protection for the blood clot, though it still doesn't guarantee that it won't come out. Using an ice pack on that side of your face will help with pain. After the first day, you can alternate between cold AND warm compresses. Of course, be sure to follow any instructions your dentist will give you. I hope this information has been both informative and helpful for you.

Thank you so much.","Doctor":"Dear Maureen, Only a dentist can examine & let you know whether there is some decay or gum problem with your back teeth. Mostly the pain must be due to Shingles (Herpes Zoster- a virus infection). which has affected the nerve  supplying to your left side. This Shingles generally happens when your immunity is low & you are under stress. Good nutrition & rest is the key along with Anti-viral therapy. Get well soon."},{"Patient":"My son had a x-ray on two teeth at the dentist , he say s he can see a shadow under them so he s sending him to the hospital for another x-ray, does this mean it could be cancer or is there other things it could be. when he asked the dentist how long a wait it would be he replied five to six weeks does this sound cause for concern.","Doctor":"Dear fried Thanks for sharing your concern. What made you think that it is a cancer? Dont be worried at all. For detecting cancer an its type biopsy is done not an x ray. Your dentist must be needing a bigger x ray like OPG for that he could have asked your son to visit hospital. In x ray you can see hard and soft tissues like teeth, bone, cyst, periodontal abscess , periapical granuloma , necrotic areas , bening tumours or quite rarely it may be malignancy too . Dark shadow or areas seen in the x ray films is called radiolucent areas . Any pathology associated with the tooth can appear radiolucent . You have not mentioned the other symptoms, like pain and mobility in the tooth. Any associated bleeding? Exact diagnosis can be made by clinical examination and related x rays. i suggest you to get an OPG radiograph done that shows the exact relation of the pathology with adjacent teeth , jaws and other vital structures. thanks"},{"Patient":"hi. I had a few brown dots on the tip of my tongue and it doesn t hurt or anything its just annoying that it s there. It has been here for a long time looking exactly the same. I brush my teeth and clean my tongue 2 to 3 times daily, so i am not sure why it s there. Do you know why i have this and how i can get rid of this?","Doctor":"Thanks for sharing your concern. Painless brown dots seen on the tongue is the called HAIRY tongue or black hairy tongue. This condition is characterised by hypertrophy of the filiform papillae of the tongue with lack of,  normal desquamation which may be extensive and form a thick matted layer on the doorsal surface. The colour of the papillae various from yelloish white to brown or even black depending upon their staining from such extrinsing factor as tobocco, certain foods, medicine or chromogenic organism of the oral cavity. Sometimes antibiotic like AUREOMYCIN, SODIUM PERBORATE, SODIUM PEROXIDE may  cause this. Are you smoking? Discontinuation of the habit might help. This is the benign condition. Food debris often collect deep between papillae and produces irriation of tongue. In such cases the TONGUE MAY BE BRUSHED with a tooth brush to promote desquamation and remove the debris.

Very annoying as it feels like I always have food crumbs on the side of my mouth, plus it s still sensitive. Btw, it happened three days ago. Should I go to a doctor and if so what kind?","Doctor":"Tongue biting and cheek biting can occur because of stress or anxiety or can occur unconsciously. Some sharp tooth or some missing tooth can also lead to tongue biting and cheek biting. Tongue and cheek biting is a deleterious habit and can lead to irritation and also increases the incidence of canker sores. Tongue biting can also cause bleeding on tongue. You need to make a self conscious effort to stop this habit of tongue biting. If there are any sharp teeth or missing teeth or your bite is not correct, then you need to consult a dentist. Your dentist can correct the sharp teeth if present. If there is some missing tooth present, then get them replaced. If bite is not correct, then you can get braces treatment or invisaligns done to correct the bite. Chewing sugar free gums may provide some help. If bleeding occurs on tongue biting, then you can keep a piece of ice or ice cold water on it and can use an antimicrobial mouth wash to reduce chances of infection."},{"Patient":"Hi there, my number 2 s are missing, I have a dentist appointment on Thursday and I dont know how to ask my dentist I want my gaps filled, I have know people that have had caps put over their number 3 s and made them look like a full set but I have asked my dentist a number of time but they say they cant do nothing,,,i really want it done!","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for the query.

If the gap in the area where lateral incisor is missing is very less then slicing and rebuildup can be done which more cosmetic .

The 2 on top are also partially out but not completely but overall in this process my overbite has gotten more visible and today when my upper right wisdom pain started i was feeling around in my mouth with my tounge and i felt a hard bone like bump towards the right side of the roof of my mouth not too close to the wisdom tooth but its not painful and im not sure if it new or i just never realized it before is it just a bone over growth or is it something to do with my wisdom teeth Thank you for your time and help AAAA","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM. Thank you for your query. This bony growth that you have recently noticed could be a less exposed end of your upper jaw, now that your wisdom tooth is coming into place you could have noticed a change in your jaw. This should not be of any worry. But an oral examination would always be best, consult your dentist for the same. Also, if you do experience any other symptoms you could visit your dentist at the earliest. If you do feel discomfort with the muscle flap that is still covering your wisdom teeth, there is a small procedure that can help expose the wisdom teeth quicker and thus avoid pain and discomfort. This is done by making a small excision on that flap. It is a safe and small procedure. Discuss the possibilities with your dentist. I hope I have succeeded in providing the information you were looking for. Please feel free to write back to me for any further clarifications. I would gladly help you.

According to the history given , it could be gingival irritation or formation of pocket or sometimes infection in the teeth too. In many cases the bleeding may be due to overextension of the margins of the crown into the gum. Sometimes there could be sharp margins too. Check for them too. I would advise you to go for oral prophylaxis first.  and this should be followed by replacement of crown. Check for occlusal fittings too.

From what i've read online it cannot be good, any suggestions or help?","Doctor":"Hi, The lump underneath the tooth with a cavity maybe a periapical abcess, ie: pus formation, forming a lump due to infection in the tooth. This needs to be treated along with your other cavities. The abcess suggests that the tooth in question is already dead which needs a root canal treatment to drain the pus, along with a course of antibiotics to eliminate infection. once the pus is drained the lump will resolve immediately. The dental offices are very patient friendly now a days and you should not worry at all. In today's day and age the dental treatment is almost painless in most of the cases. If you are still worried just go for a basic checkup on your first visit and start the treatment in your later visits once you get familiar with the doctor and the clinic.

No pain killers have helped me with pain and I can t sleep as the lower left side of my jaw and molars are constantly throbbing, it has literally been nonstop.

This occurs as a result of inflammation caused by the extraction procedure itself. The intensity and duration of pain gradually reduce and disappears. However if some amount of bone was removed then the post-operative pain or if there is some wound contamination the pain may persist. One can have some amount of swelling and fever with these conditions. You have not reported any swelling or fever. Let me know if you have some amount of swelling which is gradually increasing or if you develop fever. You may continue Diclomol for two more days and hopefully your pain should subside. In addition icing the part might give added benefits. If the pain persists or any of the aforementioned symptoms arises, it warrants attention by your doctor to rule out localised infection.

Over-the-counter analgesics are common for treatment of wisdom tooth pain. Clove oil can also be used with a pinch of pepper powder and one quarter teaspoon of rock salt to make a paste to be applied directly to the painful tooth or gum. Chewing garlic or onions is thought to be good for teeth. The gentle massaging of the cheek and the application of ice to the jaw can also help manage wisdom tooth pain.

Usually traumatic extractions lead to complications such as hematoma formation which is due to collection of blood outside the bloodvessel. Palpable lymphnodes are due the infection .

Numb sensation in the tongue or parasthesia is caused due to damage of lingual nerve due to traumatic removal of the tooth. In your case i suspect , damage to the peripheral nerve branches during extraction may have developed this loss of sensation which is temporary.

According to your question,you didn't exactly say what's your symptoms.The most frequent cause of gastritis results from habitually overeating and eating improperly cooked foods:excessive take of tea,coffee and alcoholic drinks. Symptoms are loss of appetite vomiting,headache and nausea.Chronic cases can be heartburn,fullness in the abdomen and even constipation. So you're asking how you can remove your gastric problem.There are some home remedies out there is the coconut water.It gives the stomach the rest and provides vitamins and minerals. The stomach can be returned to a normal condition if nothing but coconut water is given during the next 24 hours. I recommend also to have five small meals for your stomach to work properly. And since some of cases they tend to bloat,I recommended to drink only 8-10 glasses of water only. Lastly,avoid worries and mental tension. Cortisol known as the stress hormone let your stomach to produce more acid that can results to gastritis.

Soreness in the roof of mouth (palatal region) or ulcers can be due to multiple reasons, the most prominent being an upset stoamch or a previous course of certain antibiotics. The child may also feel soreness due to intake of hot or spicy food. The best thing would be to get it clinicaly assessed by a dentist nearby. Also, it is possible that the child is unable to localise the soreness which may be towards the throat or tonsil region as the rise in temperature could be due to some throat infection as well which might be posing difficulty for the kid to eat.

She has a BSe degree in Nursing and worked as a registered nurse in a hospital outside London. She is currently married and has a six year old son. My wife has had some dental work; tooth extraction with braces in 2004. She has been suffering from left sided chronic headache disorder for five years but increasingly worst since the beginning of year 2008. Due to her increasing and ongoing chronic headaches, she is unable to work at this movement. She has one sided headache(left) from the centre point of head involving, left side eye, cheek, lower jaw, neck, ear, and shoulder, all on left side all the time. She has seen numerous specialists regarding this problem including several neurologist both here in England and in India. She has been further investigated by ENT, Maxillofacial surgeon, chronic pain specialists and Rheumatologist who have given her various diagnosis such as trigeminal neuralgia , cluster headache , migraine, hemicranias, facial pain, post natal hormonal changes and other diagnosis. She has had several investigations such MRI, CT scan, Lumber puncher; results being normal. She is waiting to have PET scan soon. She has had physiotherapy, Acupuncture, Ayervedic treatment so forth which has not been helpful till now. She has had repeated blood works done and her ESR (High Erythrocyte Sedimentation rate) and CRP (C Reactive Protein) have noted to be high most of the time. Numerous above specialists have tried treating my wife with several medications such as : Propanolol, Diazepam, Toprimate, Sodium Valporate, Carbamezipine, Pregablin which have been discontinued in overtime as they have not been helpful. She is currently prescribed with Amitriptyline 75mg daily at night and Oramorph (Morphine Sulphate) which have noted to be helpful to a certain extent but not ultimate cure. My wife continues to experience debilitating headaches as no one have been able to find a definitive diagnosis or treatment up to today.

In your case if the pain is so severe like brain freeze  i suspect , some remnants of the infected nerve or canal left unexplored which is causing discomfort. You can get it confirmed by a x ray done for your upper teeth, accordingly if there is infection root canal should be repeated. if pain is due to gum infection , deep scaling and root planing of teeth by a dentist will solve the problem. i hope this helps, take care."},{"Patient":"its my girl friend who has the problem .

Although thumb sucking is a normal habit it causes serious teeth problems if it continues long after the eruption of permanent teeth. Prolonged finger sucking can create crowded, crooked teeth and  bite problems. You may also develop speech problems or problems with swallowing properly. Protrusion and displacement of front teeth are usual results of thumb sucking. This can affect  your facial appearance and cause further emotional problems. you can follow few steps to avoid the habit : Ask your family member to  carefully remove your fingers from mouth during sleep Don't be in anxiety or fear. If you have any emotional problems, or under stress and you need comforting, you may need to resolve those issues first before  successfully stoping the habit.

We do have a rx for amoxicillin that he is to begin taking 24 hours prior to the oral surgery .","Doctor":"hi and welcome , After reading your history i suspect the wisdom tooth you are talking about is of upper jaw. Infection in the wisdom tooth like formation of periodontal abscess may spread to adjacent teeth and some times to maxillary sinus. Infected and swollen  sinus may drain thick and discoloured mucus. excess mucus may run down the throat known as post nasal drip . the mucus drip may plug into sinus spaces leading to sinus infection. i would suggest you to get an OPG radiograph done to confirm the sinus infection ,accordingly treatment can be planned. Get the infected wisdom tooth extracted , sinus infection can be treated effectively by antibiotic coverage. i hope this helps, take care."},{"Patient":"Hello, a few months back, above just one of my teeth , my gum started hurting very badly.

Once the superficial deposits like calculus and plaque are removed, the gums slowly shrink back to their normal self although this might take some time. Also, deep curettage can be done along with root planing which is not a painfull procedure when done under local anaesthesia. This procedure is not very invasive and can work wonders for improving the gingival health. If after these and a regular oral hygiene maintenance also your problem remains, then the mucogingival surgery is the last resort. If you're not convinced by your present clinician then a second opinion would help well and you would have more clarity about these treatment options. I hope this advice solves your problem. Take care :)"},{"Patient":"i have a off white crust around the my lips in the morning. this has been going on for almost 3 weels now. the crust also presents itsself as a coating inside my mouts that causes cronic dry mouth. the crust is thick can be removed after a lond period of soaking with a warm washcloth. even after that can cause bleeding and tearing of the skin around my lips. please any ideas??","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting your query. patches of dry skin occur due to a chronic condition known as angular stomatitis If you frequently lick your lips, this can introduce bacteria or fungus into the open skin patches. Allergies or irritation also can cause angular stomatitis. If your patchy areas of skin do not respond to over-the-counter treatments, a physician may take a cotton swab to test for the presence of bacteria or fungus, including Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus topical antibiotic treatment to reduce the bacteria in the skin. Drinking plenty of water and using a humidifier in order to restore moisture to the skin also can help to reduce skin dryness.

Also I was curious on why I m 21(22 in may) and haven t gotten my wisdom teeth in yet.","Doctor":"hi and welcome to HCM, As you have mentioned the first molar you got extracted was involved with abscess. so after extraction the socket needs to be curretted to remove the pus pocket and all the debris and irritants , disinfection of the socket is done and then the wound is packed with cotton gauze . any remnants of abscessed tissue in the socket may lead to infection and pain. Secondly you may have developed a condition of Dry socket due to dislodgement of bloot clot from the extraction wound which leads to delayed healing, pain and discomfort. you need to get it clinically examined by a dentist to confirm and make a diagnosis. Pain the other teeth may be due to gingival infection which can be cured by scaling and root planing. About wisdom teeth , they normally erupt at the age of 18 to 27 years so you can still wait as you will get the eruption signs once they appear. i would suggest you to get an OPG radiograph done which will show the wisdome tooth appearing as well as infection in other teeth if any , will help in deciding treatment. i hope i answered all your doubts, take care."},{"Patient":"will nitrofurantoin macro help with a tooth infection?","Doctor":"hi and welcome, Nitrofurantoin is the medication used to deal with gram negative anaerobic bacteria and its use is rare dentistry.

Periodontitis or pyorrhea is a set of inflammatory diseases affecting the periodontium , i.e., the tissues that surround and support the teeth . Periodontitis involves progressive loss of the alveolar bone around the teeth, and if left untreated, can lead to the loosening and subsequent loss of teeth. Ideally, a periodontist ie: a gum surgeon must examine you and the treatment may consist of the following: -deep scaling -non surgical placement of drugs (antibiotics) in pockets to prevent further infection and bone loss -flap surgery (in very advanced cases where non surgical intervention does not work) -splint loose teeth (If present) However, until you visit your dentist you may use a good chlorhexidine mouthwash and warm saline gargles twice daily to flush out the stuck food from the pockets thus preventing further infection.

Periapical cyst related to roots of the teeth may cause swelling.

Prolonged mouth opening during extraction also leads to pain and discomfort in the jaw.

Dry socket is painful condition caused due to dislodgement of blood clot from the extraction socket or due to prolonged or traumatic extractions. traumatic extractions may injure the nerve fibres which leads to numbness in chin and lips which is transistory and will subside in time . i would suggest you to consult a dentist and get a clinical examination done accordingly treatment can be done followed by a course of medication will help you out. i hope this helps, take care."},{"Patient":"I am suffering from Apthous ulcer in right side cheek.

Any ulcerated area on the gums or the healing wound may become worse if dentures are used over it. i guess you have inflammed alveolar ridge or ulcerated area which is sore and hurts on application of biting forces. i would suggest you to discontinue the use of denture till the area is healed as the pressure of the denture may worsen the area. you can apply antiseptic oral ointment like dentogel over the affected area which helps in healing. mouth rinsing with lukewarm saline water may give soothing effect. i hope this helps, take care"},{"Patient":"I have a crown on one of my lower molars in the back of my mouth.

The loosening of teeth is due to gum problem. Receeding of gums takes place due wrong brushing technique. The gums become inflamed and bleed easily. Minimal trauma causes injury to gums and bleeding. Plaque/ tartar deposition on the teeth causes staining of teeth and also damages the gums. First of all you have to improve your brushing technique- brushing strokes should be soft and not harsh. It should be up and down and not side ways. You can visit your dentist and see the demonstarion of brushin. Secondily, the plaque/ tartar should be removed (scaling). Thirdly, the inflammation of the gums should be relieved. You should take saline gargles. Removal of plaque/ tartar and saline gargles will provide relief to gums.

Please drink lot of water which will help in your dry mouth situation. Please get your teeth examined by a dentist & gums by a Periodontist. Also; either a OPG or X-rays will have to be done to rule out space related issues. The reason your lower incisor is getting more crooked is that the lower wisdom teeth are pushing it as they are erupting in your mouth as your jaw size is small compared to your teeth.

She advised me either to have it extracted (which means she could offer an expensive implant) or to have a root canal done followed by a perio cleaning. My intuition told me it was not an endo problem because the tooth did not ache, only was slightly sensistive. However, later it started aching. I rushed to an endodontist, who did the first part of RCT (put some medication ). Questions: Was it the right thing to do? What is the next step? To have gum grafting? Can I have a gingival mask?","Doctor":"The normal depth of gingival sulcus is 2mm.Periodontal pocket occurs in case of chronic gum inflammation. In case of periodontal pockets, there is loss of bone and ligament and the sulcus gets deepened.  So you require pocket reduction surgery for this. Pocket reduction surgery is done to reduce the depth of the periodontal pockets and to allow less of plaque and calculus deposits and greater access for hygiene.  Pocket reduction surgery reduces the bacterial spread, stops the bone loss and enhances the smile of the patient.  If the surgery is not performed, then more destruction of gums can take place and the tooth may eventually become loose and fall. Get the surgery asap to avoid any complication.  The surgery will be performed under local anesthesia or general anesthesia.  The gums are pulled back from the teeth and bacteria and calculus will be eliminated. There will be significant reduction in periodontal pocket depth after the surgery and the condition of gums and teeth will improve significantly. Till the time you get surgery for pocket reduction done, maintain a good oral hygiene and brush and floss regularly."},{"Patient":"I went to my dentist last week with toothache , he took an xray explained I have an infection under my tooth.

Once you have been diagnosed to have renal cancer, your doctor would have done tests 1.to stage the cancer:  whether it is confined to kidney or has spread beyond that. 2. your general health : whether you will be able to withstand the curative treatments. The prognosis ( survival and quality of life) depends on the stage of the disease and general health status to withstand the treatment. I will be able to give you a better idea if you can give the details of the reports of your tests."},{"Patient":"I have a small bruise inside my top lip. The dental hygienist noticed it 10 days ago and it s still there. It hasn t gone away but seemed a little longer before and is now shorter but slightly puffier. I will get it looked at today but am a wreck. Can a mouth bruise take a while to go away if it was from biting, which I may have doe but don, t actually remember?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting your query Development of a bruise on your lip is suggestive of a bleeding disorder or bleeding due to raised blood pressure. In hope you are not taking any medicines like aspirin. You need to consult your physician to get a complete blood coagulation profile checked with APTT and platelet count to rule out other possible causes like thrombocytopenia. Your blood pressure also needs monitoring to find out if it is well controlled with medicines. This can also happen due to a viral infection in the recent past- decreases the synthesis of platelets from the bone marrow. Presence of any autoimmune disorders also needs to be ruled out. The treatment is based on the diagnosis and severity of the problem. Treatment is usually done by fluid infusion, steroids, immunoglobulins, etc according to the severity of the condition.

Ear feels like it s getting blocked.. could this be the result of the amox? Worried about taking any more. Pain in tooth was extending up to left ear and weakness down left arm . When i took painkillers (which i was on round the clock for 5 days) the arm seemed to pick up. Dentist didn t take out all the infection. He took out some and then put medication into the tooth. therefore I still have some infection in there. My concern is could the infection be spreading ? Thanks for your help.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to hcm forum, According to your dental history i would like to inform you that whenever their is infection, antibiotics are a must . I appreciate that you took antibiotics as prescribed to you. sometimes infection so severe that it takes time to resolve. I assume that you are undergoing a root canal treatment for your tooth, therefore i would like you to know that a minimum of three sittings will be required  for the infection to disappear completely. Tooth and the ear are supplied by a same nerve , which is causing pain in tooth as well as ear. Do not worry, as the infection subsides, all the symptoms will disappear, kindly follow the instructions given by your dentist, Perform warm saline rinses(3-4 times/day). i hope i answered your query, i wish you good health, take care."},{"Patient":"How serious can a lump in the next be? My mom has had a lump in the right side of her next (about where a lymph node would be) that has been swollen for nearly 2 weeks after receiving a root canal . She was put on antibiotics and none of them seemed to work. The lump has become larger, harder, and she has begun to feel more ill. Fatigue , exhaustion, overall sick. Blood work was taken over a week ago and we still haven t heard back and are unable to get in touch with the doctor. Is this something that can wait until we finally hear from the doctor, or should we head to the emergency room?","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for the query. Lump in the area of the teeth where RCT was performed suggests of any periapical cyst formation, because of  infection it may lead to lymphadenopathy, which will present with fatigue, fever, pain, and swelling. Just  taking antibiotics will not help you. See your dentist , get an x-ray done of the area affected and rule out the exact cause for the formation of lump . It has to be treated according to the diagnosis , if it is a cyst then a surgical excision is required, if lymph node enlargement due to re infection of the RCT then RCT has to be repeated .

Have been taking clindamycin for 4 weeks (150 mg x 4 a day) and am in slightly less pain. Today I inspected the lower socket and still see a small hole, I used orajel and got some relief but pain has now returned. Could this be an exposed nerve or dry socket and not an infection. I have no fever or swelling except for a little gum swelling.","Doctor":"hello & welcome after wisdom tooth removal pain & slight discomfort is obvious, but if its getting worse after 3-4 days of extraction than this may be a case of dry socket, for that you have to visit your dentist. but if there is no such complaint than this may be because of improper oral hygiene because after wisdom tooth extraction bone remain exposed for some time and any food lodgement can cause pain, so maintain proper oral hygiene start up with warm saline rinses, betadine rinses. you can take painkiller like ibuprofen (SOS) thanks & take care"},{"Patient":"i started with a toothache after a filling.

Pain after the removal of multiple teeth is common but doesnot persist for long time . primary healing will take place in 1 to 2 days which will almost relieve the pain . If the extracted area is well maintained and medication taken properly may be it is through IV line or oral your pain will be relieved. Yes, if  the extraction is associated with more trauma  or infection present in the teeth  then the healing will be delayed and you might end up with pain for  longer time might be for a week .

Asthamatic patients often have mouth breathing habit, which in turn leads to xerostomia.dryness of the mouth or xerostomia often invites oral problems like you mentioned in your patient inflammation of gums and sore throat. so i suspect it is a secondary cause of breathing habits. you can go for clinical evaluation and guide the patient accordingly.

In the meantime, take anti-inflammatory pills (paracetemol, or whatever you prefer) and clean your teeth thoroughly - use an extra-strong mouthwash (don't use mouthwash too often, because it dries the mouth, but sometimes it's a good way to kill bacteria).

Impacted wisdom tooth can lead to headaches.Impacted wisdom tooth can causes severe pain which may also be radiating to head and neck region and causes pain and swelling of the jaws. Impacted wisdom tooth can also lead to crowding of front teeth and bad breath and difficulty in mouth opening. If wisdom teeth are impacted, then you can get them removed.

Presence of radiating pain in the ear and under the jaw is because of infection in the teeth or surrounding gingival flap infection i.e. development of pericornitis, and tender lymph nodes.

It has been there for 3 days. it is small in circumference but sticks out a bit. like a tiny ball is stuck underneath the skin. It is located about a half inch from my last molar. It feels like a firm piece of cartilage because its not squishy but can be pushed and wiggled a bit. It doesn t hurt unless I put pressure on it. It is just very annoying. I had a cold about 3 and a half weeks ago and I am still having flem in the morning. Could this be a swollen sinus that is affected by the daily flem?","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for the query. The history given suggests it  may be  a  salivary duct  obstruction  known as sialolithiasis it pains only on applying presure on to it.  Usually sialolithiasis occurs in the floor of the mouth involving submandibular duct obstruction but presents with pain and swelling of the gland . It could be because of any infection caused by trauma in that area. I would advice you to see your dentist to rule out the exact cause for the formation of  lump in the palatal area.

There is possibility  of  gingival hyperplasia in the posterior area  which may be because of the tonsilitis and also could be because of any infection in the teeth or gum of the last molar , if it is wisdom teeth then it could be pericornitis , or cheek bite because of sharp cusps  can lead to this condition.

That night, I was in a lot of pain so I took ibuprofen . My cheek was swollen and the nest day I noticed a bruise . I kept ice on it most of the afternoon an evening, but didn t see a change. This morning, I woke up feeling like my throat was swollen. It is difficult to swallow , kind of like I m getting a sore throat (but it doesn t hurt). I called the dentist 1st thing this morning, the receptionist said that she d have someone call me (still waiting). Any advise?","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for the query. Pain in the teeth immediately after filling the cavity may be because of the infection in the teeth . If there is periapical infection in the teeth it will lead to abscess formation followed by swelling in the cheek or gum . As you said you have placed ice on the area all through the day , this will aggreviate the swelling and lead to throat swelling as well. It appears you have developed sore throat along with it . I would suggest you to see your dentist as early as possible , get an x- ray done to rule out the extent of infection in the teeth and surrounding the teeth . A course of antibiotics  and analgesic should be taken . Hope this information helps you.

But as you had an accident leading to breakage of the front teeth, Root canal treatment followed by placement of three unit bridge was correct decision. If natural teeth were protruded, then while making bridge this alignment can slightly be improved by adjusting the placement of the bridge. But this carries physiological limits with it. If the bridge is in the place properly, then never think that it will let the underneath teeth to protrude more than present. This is because bridge itself is an obstruction for teeth movement. But still movement can occur only if the abutment teeth are peridontically weak or patient presents with poor oral hygiene. Keep your cleaning habits proper. Visit your dentist regularly for clinical examination so that any slight movement can be anticipated & treated immediately. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi! I m 14 years old an i have had braces on for about a year and a half. But my gums are highly inflamed and seem to be growing downwards making my teeth look small. It makes me very self confident! I told my orthodontist And he said it was fine just I need to brush better. But I was looking to have my gums lazer removed. Is this possible while wearing my braces? Or will it mess up the process. Thanks so much!","Doctor":"When you have braces on and they are tightened to get your teeth straightened out in a row. The orthodontist will always advice you to have the best of oral hygiene so as to ensure that you keep your gums healthy and infection at bay. The best of brushing and flossing techniques when used even with braces on will ensure that you have gums that are not swollen. Gum swelling can also result in the gums bleeding. The first thing for you to realize it is quite common when you are new to braces to see the gums swollen. This could be the result of a gum infection called gingivitis. The first thing to do is to ensure that your teeth are perfectly clean of all tartar and plaque before you go ahead and have the braces put on. Ensure that you have an appointment with the dentist who will clean your teeth thoroughly of all plaque and tartar. Once that is done you need to ensure that you do brush and floss well so as to make certain that teeth and gums have no thriving bacteria on them. Gum swelling need not be only because of the braces but other factors as well. It could even result from hormonal fluctuation and therefore, if the gum swelling persists it’s a good idea to rule all of these out. In fact, lots of people notice that once they have the braces removed, the swelling automatically reduces and the gums get back into shape. The best way to keep your gums healthy, even with braces on and ensure that you don’t have to deal with Braces and Swelling Gums is to have a good toothbrush. The use of an electric toothbrush with braces on is a good idea as it will be able to reach every little corner of your mouth and ensure that no food particles remain embedded in them. When you have Braces and Swelling Gums another indication is that you need to further take care of your gums and teeth. This is similar symptom to gingivitis which causes bleeding and swelling of the gums. You can also try using a medicated mouthwash after every time that you brush and floss your teeth. This will reduce the swelling of the gums and make them healthier. Another thing that you need to keep a check on is that you aren’t brushing or flossing too hard. If you go on and brush hard enough it will irritate the gums and make them bleed, get infected and this will result in swelling. Dentists have specific booklets about how to go ahead and brush one’s teeth. This has the right brushing and flossing techniques.Ensure that you brush and floss after every meal and you will notice that the gum swelling surely disappears. Good oral hygiene will certainly help you keep your teeth intact and soon after you will have the best smile possible."},{"Patient":"I had root canal therapy last year but could not afford it so the office sent me home with out putting a crown on it and with a temporary filling to cover the hole. Two days ago that filling came out. I still can not afford the dentist . I was curious as to how dangerous my situation is or isn t. Also if there is any sort of filler or sealant I could purchase my self to fill the hole safely and to keep out any infection. I also need to know the best way to keep the open hole clean until I figure out what to do. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi, Thank you for the query. Loss of temporary restoration should be replaced with a permanent restoration with GIC or  miracle mix  ,at least till you get a crown done for it. If the teeth is left unfilled then there are chance of re infection and breakage of the teeth when you bite on it . I suggest you to see your dentist and get the permanent filling done and plan for getting a crown placed on to it as early as you can and make sure you donot eat anything hard on the teeth  . Hope this information helps you. Take care."},{"Patient":"hi there, i m 29 years old and i have the excessive saliva problem for the past 5, 6 years.

Although recovery time is considered to be 2-3 days, there is a chance it might take a while longer. There is also a chance that there could have been some damage to a blood vessel during the extraction process.

After the surgery, I have followed all post operative conditions and made sure to avoid getting dry socket. After a day I had experienced a significant amount of swelling on my right side but it gradually decreased and was fine until tonight (4 days later). I was awoken in the middle of the night due to pain in the right side of my mouth and I found my inner cheek is now swollen on the right side. It seemed to me that everything was going fine, I am not sure what this sudden swelling means inside my mouth. The pain is so bad that I cannot sleep, especially not if I lay down on my right side. What do you think about this?","Doctor":"Swelling is another common problem after the extraction of wisdom tooth. Rather the painful swelling is a good sign and is indicator of normal progress of healing process of wound. There is no fixed time frame for its duration and level of severity. These can be different from person to person. To reduce the amount of swelling one can do cold fermentation with ice. It should be done for 20 minutes and then take break of 20 minutes. Do this for one hour within 12 hours of surgery. Do not do hot fermentation.  The post operative instructions of the dentist explain all this including the start and reduction of swelling. Normally it takes 7 days for swelling to subside and if this does not happen within this expected time then one should call up the dentist to checkup. In cases where swelling once goes away and then sets in again, this can be due to infection in the wound."},{"Patient":"Mu husband has a swelling in his left parotid gland .

Impacted wisdom tooth eruption can also cause pain in the jaws and teeth. Constant cheek irritation by broken tooth can also cause pain and tenderness.  If tooth is broken, then you need treatment for your broken tooth. If nerve of the tooth is not exposed, then tooth can be restored with dental filling or crown but if nerve of the tooth is exposed or necrosed, then root canal treatment followed by dental crown is required for the tooth. If tooth is badly mutilated, then post and core procedure is required after root canal therapy. If broken tooth is unrestorable, then tooth extraction followed by replacement of missing tooth with dental implants or dental bridge is required. Only pain meds will be of little help. Hot compresses are not indicated as they will aggravate the swelling. You can do warm saline rinses to reduce the swelling.  You need to get treatment done for infected tooth. If you have cost constrains, then you can visit a dental school where treatment is done by dental students under supervision of experienced dentists. You can also look for free dental clinics near you or can talk to your local dentist if you can pay in installments for treatment. By the time you visit your dentist, you can avoid eating from side of broken tooth. You can also apply orajel for some relief.

The treatment of microscopic colitis has not been standardized because there have not been adequate large scale, prospective, placebo controlled treatment trials. The following strategies are safe and may relieve diarrhea in some patients: Avoid nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Trial of lactose elimination (just to eliminate the possibility that intolerance to lactose in milk is aggravating the diarrhea) Antidiarrhea agents such as loperamide (Imodium) or diphenoxylate and atropine (Lomotil) Bismuth subsalicylate such as Pepto-Bismol budesonide (Entocort EC) 5-ASA (mesalamine) compounds such as Asacol, Pentasa, or Colazal Controlled trials showed that budesonide (Entocort, a poorly absorbed steroid) is effective in controlling diarrhea in more than 75% of the patients with collagenous colitis, but the diarrhea tends to recur soon after stopping Entocort.

The mixture can be made by mixing ½ tablespoon salt to 8 oz. of warm water. You must do mouth wash rinses every hour. *Applying a cold compress helps reduce swelling. Make sure not to apply ice directly over the skin as it can damage the skin and increase the pain.You can wrap the ice cubes in a bath towel and then apply over the affected region. The time for application is 20 minutes off and 20 minutes on. *Take OTC drugs like ibuprofen"},{"Patient":"I had root canal on a tooth a few months ago and all has been well until a few days ago.

The pain is worse at night and i ve taken advil which helps for many hours until the next night.

Mucoceles are lumps formed as a result of saliva the escapes into the tissue from damaged salivary glands (minor). They are translucent and bluish grey in color. The main cause is trauma. Usually they burst down but if not then requires surgical removal under local anesthesia. The bump in the gum can be hard or soft swelling.

It can occur because of stress or anxiety or can occur because of traumatic bite present. It causes soreness of jaw, headaches, sensitivity of teeth etc. Teeth grinding can cause wearing of the tooth structure which may involve dental pulp and cause soreness of tooth. If dental pulp is also involved due to tooth wearing, then you will require root canal treatment. You have to visit your dentist to get your teeth evaluated. Your dentist may take an x-ray to see that whether dental pulp is involved in sore teeth or not.  Its better if you get a custom made mouth guard from a dentist than using the mouth guard which you got from pharmacy. Mouth guard should be made according to patient’s teeth and alignment of his teeth. Mouth guard absorbs the chewing forces and prevent damage to teeth and surrounding tissues. Main causes of teeth grinding are stress or traumatic bite. You need to reduce your stress levels. If there is traumatic bite present which is causing teeth grinding, then dentist can correct it.  By the time, you visit your dentist you can take OTC pain meds."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have been experiencing a feeling of rawness in my mouth for over 12 weeks, it changes area but is concentrated at the gums at the back of my wisdom teeth .

I have been to my doctor 8 weeks ago when it began and was told there is nothing wrong, i have also been to the dentist who told me it was in my head and could be due to stress .","Doctor":"Tongue biting and cheek biting can occur because of stress or anxiety or can occur unconsciously. Some sharp tooth or some missing tooth can also lead to tongue biting and cheek biting. Tongue and cheek biting is a deleterious habit and can lead to irritation and also increases the incidence of canker sores. Tongue biting can also cause bleeding on tongue. You need to make a self conscious effort to stop this habit of tongue biting. If there are any sharp teeth or missing teeth or your bite is not correct, then you need to consult a dentist. Your dentist can correct the sharp teeth if present. If there is some missing tooth present, then get them replaced. If bite is not correct, then you can get braces treatment or invisaligns done to correct the bite. Chewing sugar free gums may provide some help. If bleeding occurs on tongue biting, then you can keep a piece of ice or ice cold water on it and can use an antimicrobial mouth wash to reduce chances of infection."},{"Patient":"I have a red bump on my gums between two molars.

Amount of pain which occurs after tooth extraction is dependent on procedure which is used for the extraction of the tooth and the degree of trauma to the adjacent tissues.Pain can be managed after tooth extraction withover the counter pain medicaments.Analgesics are given after the tooth extraction to relieve the pain.During the first 24 hours after tooth extraction, you should take soft and liquid diet and should avoid taking food from the side where tooth was extracted. It is advised to do warm saline rinses 24 hours after the tooth extraction to reduce the pain and swelling. Take rest.You should avoid spitting, sucking, drinking anything with straw for minimum of 24 hours after tooth extraction and should not smoke for minimum of 2 days after tooth extraction.Smoking can create negative pressure and can cause dislodgement of clot and lead to dry socket. It is also common to have pain in the jaw after the extraction as the mouth is held open for long time during the tooth extraction. Massaging the muscles gently, hot compresses application and over the counter analgesics can reduce the soreness of the jaw.

Tonsililitis chronica is  an infection and oval shaped  swelling of the lymph gland tissue located on both sides on the back of the throat caused because of the bacterial or viral infection .

Thanks in advance!","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM An erupting tooth is associated with pain in the gums but throbbing pain does not occur. Throbbing pain indicates infection and pus accumulation. You can take over the counter analgesics but you should consult a dentist at the earliest. If there is pus accumulation, it has to be drained. Wisdom teeth ae associated with impactation, growth in different directions and infection. So, a clinical examination, X-ray of the wisdom tooth area is required. Surgical removal of the tooth and drainage of pus may be called for. So, visit your dentist at the earliest.

You are not clear in what exactly was done with dental lasers. No dentist can fix any gap between the teeth using lasers. What i feel is that the gap was fixed with composite resin restoration which requires a light cure gun at the end, and you are confused with the light cure gun as dental lasers.

Can you show me the different types of dentures that are lighter weight. I swear the ones I was shown had a redish look to them but not when they brought them in yesterday","Doctor":"Lightweight skeleton dentures leave the roof of your mouth clear so that you can still taste your food and so that there is nowhere for debris to collect when you eat.The metal conducts heat so that you get the correct temperature sensation from the food in your mouth and the clasps grip your teeth tightly so that the dentures stay firmly put when you chew sticky food.The cost of a denture depends on the type of base material used and the quality of the teeth used. The cheapest teeth, wear rapidly, chip and look poor after a short period of time. The very best teeth are all porcelain which are very expensive but look excellent. In between there are many extremely good acrylic teeth to choose from.The cost will be between £800 and £1000."},{"Patient":"I had all 4 wisdom teeth extracted this past Monday (currently Friday night).

Is this normal or should I be concerned about the possibility of dry sockets? Also, how long would this typically take to heal? I uploaded a picture of the gum area. Thanks","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM It has been four days only since you got your wisdom teeth extracted. After extraction of the tooth a space is created where the teeth once were present. This space will initially be filled with blood and slowly the granulation tissue will grow into it. Granulation tissue is fibrous tissue with newly erupted blood vessels. Slowly entire area will be converted into a firm soft tissue as your gums. So, there is nothing to worry. Do not be over concerned with that area. Leave it on its own to heal. In the meanwhile you can take saline gargles and pain killers if it hurts. In case there is excessive pain you can report it to your dentist to rule out infection.

A doctor will need to take a closer look at it to evaluate. Do you present with any other symptoms like fever, chills, joint pains etc which could be signs of infection.

Plaque and food accumulates in relation to teeth cause gingivitis. Gingivitis can also occur because of vitamin C deficiency. To avoid bleeding during brushing, it is important to brush and floss regularly and maintain a good oral hygiene to avoid deposits around teeth. You can also use a mouth wash to reduce bacteria in your mouth. Mouth wash is a chemical adjunct to plaque removal.  If gums are swollen, then you can do warm saline rinses 3-4 times a day.

In case of recent history of cold...you might experience similar symptoms seen with sinusitis and pharyngitis...If you dont have any symptoms pertaining to your upper respiratory tract then the reason could be attributed to the root canal treatment performed.....throbbing kind of pain is usually associated with infections...root canal failure can be attributed to various reasons...improper filling of the root canals, any left over accessory canal, filling beyond the root apex...dead space in the root canal will all lead to accumulation of the micro organisms and would trigger pain.... a radiograph needs to be taken to assess the aptness of the root canal...Consult your dental surgeon for clinical evaluation and management..."},{"Patient":"Hello...on Nov. 5th, 2012, I had a full upper denture and partial lower denture procedure. Overall, things went well and the pain was manageable but I did notice a pain in my throat on the right side for the first few weeks, similar to having a swollen gland when ill with a cold. The pain along with the general pain from having 22 teeth extracted gradually subsided and I have been back to my dentist for a few adjustments due to sore spots and have had no other complaints. Now, almost two months later, my dentures are very loose and ill-fitting and I am using every type of OTC treatment to make them comfortable enough for me to eat, work and talk (I am a 9-1-1 dispatcher). Over the last two days another painful area has developed in my throat, this time on the left side and much more severe. It seems to me that it is somewhat aligned with the area where the base of my tongue evolves. It is very painful to the touch and I take Ibupropen to dull the ache. My dentist is evaluating me for a realignment on January 7, but is out of the office until that time. Should I be alarmed at this acute discomfort or is it a typical malady? Thank you in advance for your assistance! Pat/Female/57","Doctor":"hi Pat, first you have to be very specific that you are wearing partial denture in anterior or posterior region, because this pain may be due to overextended denture as you are saying that they are ill fitting. to rule out this stop wearing your denture for 1-2 days, if you start getting relief than this is the only cause & you have to go for realignment. After extractions we always wait for few months before making denture because bone resorption is very fast in first few months of extraction. if you feel any gland enlargement, and don't get any relief than better visit your  ENT surgeon & in the mean time you can start up with course of antibiotic including azithromycin 500mg once daily for 3 days & ibuprofen 400 mg (SOS) , don't do any heat application by yourself. take care"},{"Patient":"my son baby 7 months old is suffering from loose motion 8 to 9 times a day in fluid form. treated with antibiotics no effect please reply......","Doctor":"Hello. .

And I had low Vitamin B , not sure which one, but they have started me on a Complex B supplement . My doctor has started me on 50mcg Synthroid . I have been on it for about 6 weeks, with no change in the gums, etc. Is it possible that an increased amount of Synthroid might relieve the swollen gums? My dentist wants to do a full scale scraping of my gums, where they peel back my gums for a deep, deep cleaning and I am hesitant as I feel this may be hormonal versus bacteria, in origin. PS: I have had normal, dental cleanings for years with no issues. It was not until the sudden onset of the swollen, red, bleeding gums . So I guess my question is two fold. One, with increased thyroid treatment, will my gum issue resolve and secondly, is it appropriate for me to tell my dentist to Hold Off on the full peel back because my gums are swollen and bleed when agitated?","Doctor":"hello & welcome as you are diagnosed with Hashimotos disease, your treatment will be bidirectional. Along with your thyroid management your dental health management is also necessary. To increase the dose of Synthroid is not the solution of this problem. scaling & curettage (deep cleaning) will help to reduce inflammation of your gums and will reduce bleeding too. Along with the dental treatment you have to maintain your oral hygiene too. Warm saline rinses 3 times a day, message of gums with TAN-X gum paint for 2-3 minutes twice a day, and 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthwash twice a day & brushing with extra soft brush will help you. have a nice day & take care."},{"Patient":"Dear Dr, i would like your opinion on a braces matter i went for a consultation for ice braces & the doctor told me i will need only 8 months for the braces . i am getting married first of Sep & i told him if i needed longer time i wont be able to do it. he is a very reputable doctor & wont decieve me for the money as he already has a thousands of patients. i am however worried about the 8 months time frame . is it possible to have crowding corrected in 8 months ? thanks alot","Doctor":"hello and welcome to hcm forum, i would be glad to answer your query, first of all i , with all due respect to you and your dentist i would like to inform you that being a dentist we cannot assure you of the time period a tooth takes to moves from its original position to a new position. you have not mentioned your age here, but i believe you might be older than 20. ideally, orthodontic treatment is done during the growth years (puberty), but in some cases, we do perform orthodontic treatment  beyond that age as well, as in your case orthodontic treatment can be done but the time & the results cannot be decided before. As the teeth and jaws have developed fully, therefore to retain them in a new position , you will need permanent retainers which hold the teeth in an appropriate place, do not worry these are not visible to anyone. i would advise you to get the orthodontic treatment done but avoid unrealistic expectations, just have faith in your dentist. i wish you good health, take care."},{"Patient":"Okay so I ve been experiencing large amount of pain the last few days and.I thought it was due to my.wisdom teeth growing in but it seems to be my tooth next to my wisdom that.is.causing the pain I know the fact that this tooth has a very bad cavity.that exposes.the nerve isnt helping, I just want to know how can I fix.this I really want to get the tooth removed but I don t have dental insurance and or enough money to go get this down what should I do?","Doctor":"Hello there....If your wisdom tooth is angulated (mesio-angular/horizontally impacted tooth)  towards the second molar (the one adjacent to wisdom tooth), food gets impacted between these two teeth...the food impacted cannot be cleaned by you....this starts damaging your 2nd molar...

All that you need to do is to go to the dentist for a second time and explain the pain and how you feel. The dentist will then be able to ascertain the reason for the pain after the filling and address the concerns.

Swelling occurs because of the inflammatory exudate that develops following surgical removal..this fluid with some amount of blood, gets collected beneath your mucosa and results in swelling... this swelling starts by the end of 1st day, increases in size and then gradually decreases by 4-5 th day.... Continue with the same medication your doctor has prescribed....we usually dont advice resorbable (dissolving) sutures for the extracted sockets owing to the chances of infection...get your sutures removed by 7-8th day... If the same amount of swelling or pain persists even after the 6th day consult your doctor for further evaluation and management."},{"Patient":"Hi! I first started having some minor pains in one of my wisdom teeth . My dentist said that one will never fully come in because it doesn t have enough room. Lately, I ve had major pain in the area of my wisdom tooth (bottom left) and then the pain moved into the back of my mouth and my mouth seemed extremely tight. Then it became painful to swallow and also, sometimes my lower and upper left gums start hurting. If I don t talk or move my mouth a lot, it becomes painful to sleep etc.","Doctor":"Hello there....this is a consequence of an unerupted lower third molar... pain from the lower impacted third molar usually radiates to the throat region, middle ear and left temple region (side of your head above the ear)..If the pain is severe that would  even hurt when you swallow... If left untreated there are chances for the tooth to get infected and would result in decreased mouth opening (trismus).... Get you wisdom tooth removed from a Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon as they are experts in handling these kind of teeth...."},{"Patient":"I got all four wisdom teeth removed 8 days ago. One was a difficult removal. (She had to cut it in haf etc) I didnt get stitches.

Exposing red tissue. Is this something to worry about?","Doctor":"Hello there...since it has already been 8 days following the removal do not worry about the red tissue what you see...It is the granulation tissue that fills up the socket and since the tooth removal has been carried out, the marginal gingiva would appear little erythematous... stop middling the gum, there...That would result in infection...It would take 15-21 days for the entire mucosal covering. Dont worry about that.....You can use a gum astringent if you find your gum to be swollen and continue with warm saline rinses... In case you have pain with any discharge that tastes bitter or salty, consult your doctor for clinical evaluation and management...."},{"Patient":"For about 4 months now I have had a small rad spot right on my gum underneath my tooth.

Once the symptoms of sinusitis and cold are treated your problem of bad smell would regress.... When you have deposits getting accumulated over your teeth, the gums get inflamed and swollen....There are millions of microorganisms in the oral cavity...As when you eat they start decomposing the food particles and that results in foul smell...get a thorough oral prophylaxis done and then can use mouth rinses to keep away from bad breadth... the above findings - cold and deposits over your teeth, might concurrently be present....then you have to get treated for both...I advice you to consume lots of water...

If the upper third molars is placed towards the cheek, as when you occlude your teeth the mucosa falls between your teeth and causes cheek bite...If you have sharp cusps this would also cause cheek bite as when you occlude...If upper third molar is the cause then you need to get it removed.... Sharp cusps can be managed by grinding them..

I have no idea whats wrong with my mouth.","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to HCM I would like to tell you that all your symptoms indicate that you are having gingivitis. You need to go for oral prophylaxis in that case.Also follow certain instructions like:- 1. Floss first then brush your whole mouth including your gums, cheeks, roof of mouth, tongue and take a full 3 minutes brushing your teeth. 2. Sugar free Chewing gum: Since dry-mouth can increase bacterial build-up and cause or worsen bad breath, chewing sugarless gum can help with the production of saliva, and thereby help to reduce bad breath. Chewing may help particularly when the mouth is dry, or when one cannot perform oral hygiene procedures after meals. 3. Gargling right before bedtime with chlorhexidine mouthwash. 4. Maintaining proper oral hygiene, including daily tongue cleaning, brushing, flossing, and periodic visits to dentists and hygienists. Flossing is particularly important in removing rotting food debris and bacterial plaque from between the teeth, especially at the gum line.

Surgical extraction of wisdom tooth is done in most of the cases. Dentist will numb you and then will remove the tooth. For some pain relief, you can do warm saline rinses 3-4 times a day. Warm saline rinses will reduce swelling of gums in that area and will provide some relief. You can also apply orajel over site. You can take pain meds. Avoid eating from side of affected tooth and maintain good oral hygiene. Food accumulation in relation to wisdom tooth will aggravate the pain. You can try these remedies for pain relief."},{"Patient":"I have undergone flapsurgery twice. Even then gum pocket develops in the lower jaw - left side on wisdom tooth +8 What is the remedy.

These defects are breeding grounds for bacteria and a place for debris to get stuck causing chronic inflammation and risk of attachment loss.  Sometimes the wisdom teeth need to be extracted to prevent the progression of the disease from moving anteriorly in your mouth.  Ways that you can help with the reduction of pockets:  see your dentist/periodontist on a regular basis usually every three months.  brush 3 times a day, floss 2 times a day and use listerine 1 time a day.

This could be the result of a gum infection called gingivitis. The first thing to do is to ensure that your teeth are perfectly clean of all tartar and plaque before you go ahead and have the braces put on. Ensure that you have an appointment with the dentist who will clean your teeth thoroughly of all plaque and tartar. Once that is done you need to ensure that you do brush and floss well so as to make certain that teeth and gums have no thriving bacteria on them. Gum swelling need not be only because of the braces but other factors as well. It could even result from hormonal fluctuation and therefore, if the gum swelling persists it’s a good idea to rule all of these out."},{"Patient":"my four wisdom teeth extration areas are well healed now since the oct 24 2012 surgery.

I mean I know there are thousands of them online ..... but still I would like to know from you. P.S. Lack of oral hygiene isn t the cause. I brush my teeth twice a day or sometimes even more, use tongue cleaner to clean my tongue, floss and also rinse/gargle with mouthwash( Listerine ). Thanks !!","Doctor":"Halitosis -  bad breadth  has many reasons right from the food you eat to the acid secreted in your stomach. the main factors are with oral hygiene maintenance. Inspite of brushing regularly..there are deposits that get accumulated on the teeth surface, that does not come out with your brushing...You have to get your teeth cleaned from a dental surgeon. Hence we recommend to get the teeth cleaned every 6 months. These deposits causes gum enlargement. Bacteria thrive in these spaces and decomposes the food you eat leading to halitosis. If you feel your mouth is getting dried...have plenty of water...dry mouth would also cause bad breadth."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor..i just had my wisdom tooth removed 3 days back.....as common i am having swollen cheeks...but apart from this im also having some bleeding from my throat (i suppose tonseils)... when i cough and spit the flum out...7/10 times i have some stint of blood mixed with it...also while swallowing food it is paining in my throat.

You can get them from multiple reasons including trauma, stress, changes in diet etc.  I recommend giving it 10 days to heal and if the problem has not resolved by then, see your dentist.  You could also have a periodontal or tooth infection in that area. Good Luck"},{"Patient":"Hi my name is XXXXXX.

Management of bad breath: 1. Floss first then brush your whole mouth including your gums, cheeks, roof of mouth, tongue and take a full 3 minutes brushing your teeth. 2. Eating a healthy breakfast with rough foods helps clean the very back of the tongue. 3. Chewing gum: Since dry-mouth can increase bacterial build-up and cause or worsen bad breath, chewing sugarless gum can help with the production of saliva, and thereby help to reduce bad breath. Chewing may help particularly when the mouth is dry, or when one cannot perform oral hygiene procedures after meals. 4. Gargling right before bedtime with an effective mouthwash. 5. Maintaining proper oral hygiene, including daily tongue cleaning, brushing, flossing, and periodic visits to dentists and hygienists. Flossing is particularly important in removing rotting food debris and bacterial plaque from between the teeth, especially at the gum line."},{"Patient":"I had a big white blister above my front damaged teeth , i popped it and yellow puss came out, it then went, but kept on reappearing every year for last 5 years!!

For the last four days my crooked tooth has started giving some trouble..can i go to the dentist for some medicine before i complete my thalium stress test and then proceed for my dental procedure?","Doctor":"Hello there... Removal of the wisdom tooth at times require a small surgical procedure. For any surgical procedure be it any where in the body requires thorough systemic examination. Cardiovascular normalcy is very much needed for any surgical procedure. Few drugs such as Ecosprin are prescribed by the Physicians and Cardiologists to maintain the hemodynamics in terms of preventing internal blood clots. So that, no cardiac problems arises. It has become mandatory for people in their early 40 's to take the ecosprin as a preventive measure from heart attack's. This drug causes thinning of blood and prevents clotting. Surgical procedures are always involved with bleeding. Even a small procedure like extracting a tooth involves some amount of blood. Ecosprin causes irreversible platelet aggregation that would prevent blood from clotting. That is the reason we usually ask the patient to stop the medication 3 days prior to the removal of tooth and continue the medication after one day of tooth removal. There are fresh set of platelets that get formed in your blood in these three days and would retain the clotting mechanism. For the pain you have you can always use analgesics. Your dental surgeon is justified asking you for a cardiac advice. Do get the cardiologist advice before you proceed with the dental procedures."},{"Patient":"hi,at the base of my tounge ,skinn is thickening and sometime when iam talking its make me some discomfort.it may have the size of 1.5mm and it at the left side of my tounge and nearer to the middle.iam 26 years old lady and mother of a 3 years boy.there s no other difficulties i have now.but iam very much worrying whether it is a cancer .my email id is YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to HCM Dental Health Public Forum, You dont have to worry about the condition, You might have bitten your tongue or it can be aphthous ulcer or  it might be some pathological growth which can be diagnosed only seeing physically.

There are many dental and oral conditions which give the same clinical appearance as you say. It can be either due to periodontal abcess ( cause due to gum infection ) , periapical abcess (caused due to carious tooth which has reached the nerve of the tooth and made it infectious) , erupting and infectious tooth whish again causes gum infection.

Take some rest & start with amoxiclav-625 twice a day along with zerodol-SP twice a day.Also take some multivitamin & antacid like rabeprazole 20 mg if acidity persists.Take all this for 5 days because ibuprofen is very mild analgesic.

Excess dosage of anesthesia, rapid absorption etc can lead to severe adverse reaction involving central nervous system and heart. Nervousness, lethargy, dizziness, sickness can occur because of allergic reaction. Adverse drug reaction with local anesthesia can be fatal.You can visit a physician for evaluation.

I put pressure on and it and after a while it stops. I really don t know what to do about it at this point . I have had 7 surgerys and the last one I notice this vessel after they shove the breathing tube in my mouth it scratched the roof of my mouth and that s when I noticed it.","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for your question. You may have a hemangioma on the roof of your mouth.  Or it may be normal vasculature.  The best bet is to address this with your dentist to have it viewed.  The roof of your mouth is heavily vascular, you have several arteries that supply the blood from the roof of your mouth coming from foramens in your skull from behind your front teeth and next to your molars.  The area if injured tends to bleed a lot and does require good pressure to gain control of the bleeding.  By scratching I am assuming with a oropharyngeal tube in surgery or by accident with a tortilla chip. These items can cause trauma and cutting of the blood vessels.  If you have something where you gently scratch the roof or your mouth with a finger and it bleeds then I recommend getting into a dental office for proper evaluation for pathologies.

If you have limited jaw opening I recommend a few exercises to help increase mobility and ease the pain in your jaw:Take a tube sock, fill it with white rice, microwave for two minutes, when it is cool enough that it doesn't burn place in over your jaw joints 20 minutes on 10 minutes off for 1 hour three times a day for 5 days. This is warm moist heat that penetrates deep into the muscles and helps clean out the lactic acid build up causing some of the discomfort.  This will also help increase blood flow to help deliver anti inflammatories better.Take Motrin (Ibuprofen) 600mg every 6 hours for 5 days, do not drink alcohol, and if taking other medications make sure there aren't interactions.  Do not exceed 3200mg a day and do not take if pregnant.  Gently open your mouth, if it is restricted gently force it open further with your pointer finger and thumb in a scissoring manner.  Do this for 20 minutes twice a day until mobility improves.  Follow all of this with plenty of water to wash out the lactic acids built up in the muscles.  8 8oz glasses a day.  Follow up with your dentist if problems persist.Best regardsDr. Ward"},{"Patient":"hi i think i have an abcess but im unsure, I have a canine tooth in my gum that never came down into line i have had pain in it since yesterday but it has never bothered me before i have just noticed what i think mite be an abcess above the tooth on my gum nearly in line with my nose it is very painful every few hours and brings on temperature and headache","Doctor":"Hello there.....what is your age? the canine tooth usually erupts between 10-13 years....

Every taste bud detects five primary tastes: sour, sweet, bitter, salty, umami (salts of certain acids). All tastes come from a combination of these basic taste sensations. You might have damaged your taste buds, due to smoking, or have a vitamin or mineral deficiency (B-12 or zinc). But there is a third possibility, which has to do with a sinus drainage: most of what people perceive as taste is due to their ability to smell.

They almost look like bruises. I am 20 years old, never smoked before and rarely drink alcohol. Whay could this possibly be?","Doctor":"Hello there....What do u mean by bump? swelling? There are few age related swellings /lesions in the palate that arise with indefinite etiology...One need not have a history of  smoking or alcohol consumption to have them. They might be associated with minor salivary glands of the palate also. Impacted  upper third molars erupting palatally would also give such a clinical picture. Since yours is the right age for the eruption of wisdom teeth, that might also be the cause. Get yourself evaluated from a Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon only."},{"Patient":"Hi Dr.I have undergone extraction procedure of my upper molar tooth and took antibiotics (Ampiclox and trinidazole) for a week, I have come to realize some small particle (portion of one root) remained. so far no serious pain felt, however am worrying if there any complication might come later. pls help me what to do","Doctor":"Hello there... Root fracture occurs for various reasons. It depends on the root morphology and the way it is removed....The dental surgeon  has to remove the tooth completely. A maxillary molar (upper molar) usually has three roots. Morphology at times can be different.  There are situations where in you can retain the fractured roots. It is a fact that any root piece measuring less than 4 mm (few consider it 2-3mm)  can be retained as it gets resorbed. Molar teeth are usually close to the maxillary sinus. Improper attempt to remove the root stump would displace it into the sinus resulting in unnecessary complications. So for the benefit of the patient we inform them and leave the root stump for resorption. It resorbes most of the times or it stays dormant. Any root fragment measuring more than 4mm should not be retained as it would lead to complications in the future in terms of cyst or interfere with healing or with your replaced teeth."},{"Patient":"Hi, I m 39. I recently recovered from a gum infection under my right rearmost molar. Very painful. Now I am experiencing more pain and tenderness in the gum that presses against the back of my right wisdome tooth. I think it s infected (when I swallow I also hear crackling in my ears. Hoping to get some advice before going down the rabbit hole of seeing doctors or specialists (I don t have insurance at the moment). Here are the details: - seven months ago I had my teeth cleaned; all was normal except at the end of my checkup, my dentist said I should keep an eye on my right rear wisdom tooth because there was a bit of movement. - six months ago I noticed an odd sense of pressure in my right ear. - this roughly coincided with a throat infection ( antibiotics cleared it up) - hurt as hell - not sure if it s related. - following the throat infection, I experienced ongoing tightness of the throat. Sometimes hard to swallow and speak. Continues to this day. - about nine weeks ago I experienced soreness in my gum behind my right wisdom tooth. It went away eventually (lots of rinsing). - ear pressure continues.... - six weeks ago I developed severe pain in my right jaw. Antibiotics cleared it up for about a week, but the pain came back. - when it came back, I was in agony with pain in my jaw. Couldn t sleep or think... A few days later I had developed a periodontal (gum) abscess below my rear right molar - the tooth in front of the questionable wisdom tooth. - my dentist drained the abscess (yes, sorry... gross) and put me on antibiotics. (Diagnosis was a periodontal pocket which has since healed quickly.) - this cleared things up (severe, life altering head throbbing pain is gone thank god) and things were back to normal. - that was a week ago. - however, now I am experiencing the same pain behind my wisdom tooth. The gum is sore in a small region behind the tooth. I have pressure in my right ear and it s sometimes hard to swallow.","Doctor":"Hello there...After all that do you mean that your wisdom tooth is retained? Periodontal abscess or any kind of abscess related to the wisdom tooth i advice go for the removal. Pain with relation to the lower wisdom tooth will have a characteristic pain radiating to the ear on that side, to the throat, side of your head (temple region), that side of the jaw, difficulty in swallowing . We call this referred pain...The other complication you see are the space infections and restricted mouth opening. antibiotics wont help once the space infections sets in...Surgical intervention becomes mandatory. Get your wisdom tooth removed. Consult a Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon for clinical evaluation and management."},{"Patient":"I had my wisdom teeth taken out 6 days ago. Now I have a knot in my cheek along my buttom jaw, like a rock and it had drainage that smelled and tasted horrible. I went back to my oral surgeon and he said it wasn t infected and then packed it. I still feel like it s leaking and it s incredibly painful. I m not really sure what I should do.","Doctor":"Hello, Residual drainage can occur for a few days after extraction of the wisdom teeth because the extraction can be a bit different from the other teeth. When the drainage accumulates, it subsequently is invaded by the bacteria giving rise to the horrible smell. This is not infection and usually does not require antibiotics. The cavity that is present would decrease in size with packing so also the drainage. However, there can be quite a bit of pain and swelling till about 2 weeks after extraction and especially following packing but this would also subsequently come down if there is no infection."},{"Patient":"My sgpt report is 84.2 than what is the possibility of jaundice?","Doctor":"You probably mean \\"jaundice\\". An elevated SGPT means that your liver is not working properly, but not enough explanation can be given unless the results of the entire liver profile are given. The chance of jaundice happening is more dependent on what your bilirubin level is instead."},{"Patient":"So my gums were swelling a bit and when I placed pressure on my teeth it was a strange pressure. my teeth felt loose but when I tried to move the teeth with my finger they seemed very much so intact. So I upped to brushing three times a day instead of two-did a salt rinse and placed salt on what I possibly thought might be infected places..flossed lots..and did antiseptic mouth wash. Last night the pressure in my mouth finally went away in my gums and face and I was able to *eat* properly and it felt so great but even now my teeth feel like they have these weird gaps...

I went back to the dentist to have them look at it and they took an xray of my lower left side where they extracted the tooth and they said that it doesn t look like i have a infection or dry socket. So what could be causing such horrible pain in my jaw?","Doctor":"Hello, It is normal to experience severe pain even after a couple of days of surgery. Sometimes, one has to take off a bit of bone during extraction of the tooth because the tooth can be impacted and deep seated within the jaw. In these cases, there can be severe pain especially with chewing. Go on taking the analgesics on a regular basis, the pain would take some time in coming down in intensity. If there is no other problem like infection then there is no need for worry."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 21 years old and recently (for the last 2 months or so) I have had 2 enlarged circumvallate papilli on the back of my tongue and white spots at the back of my tongue as well.

It can happen with food you eat,the way you clean your tongue, the medication you take or because of any underlying systemic condition. Since your doctors have already seen you, there's shouldn't be systemic cause. When your mouth gets dried up very fast there is a white layer that forms which gets discolored by the food you eat.

Its now monday night and i only feel a small amount of dull soreness which should be normal but im concerned it could be the beginning of dry socket. Would i know if my clot was dislodged as it happened? Thanks","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to HCM I would like to tell you that after tooth extraction, a blood clot slowly forms in the hole left in the bone by the removed tooth. This blood cloth is the initial phase of the healing process. The blood clot’s formation can be slowed down when a person smokes, either from the suction done during the smoking action, or from the chemical toxins that come from a cigarette. This can lead to complications such as a dry socket, which is a temporary and very painful condition that occurs when the blood clot forms slowly. It is therefore recommended to wait at least 48 to 72 hours before smoking after a dental extraction. Smoking is very bad for someone’s health and stopping completely is mostly recommended.Continue your medicines as prescribed by your dentist.Along with that do betadine gargles 3-4 times a day.Get a check-up done after a week.

Hi, I am doing invisaligns and I now have to move halfway through my treatment This was at a cost of 6000, composed of a 1500 down payment and 250 monthly payments. I still have 2000 to pay. However, since I am moving I have to terminate my program with my current dentist . I have done 9 months already and I still have 9 months to go. My orthodontist suggested that I pay the last 2000 and she will hand over the remaining trays. It will then be up to me to correctly switch them every 2 weeks and also get a new orthodontist that can do regular checks and continue the treatment. I have done some research and asked a few orthodontist friends and they have told me that the actual cost of invisaligns to the dentist may range between 1000-3000, then you have to think about general revenue and other fees such as overhead fees. I feel it is not fair for me to pay the full 6000 if my dentist will not have to provide me any services for the last 9 months of my treatment.

In case of severe gum infection, periodontitis, pain is usually localized but can radiate deep into the jaw. If wisdom tooth is impacted that is there is not enough space for wisdom tooth to erupt, then severe pain occurs which may also be radiating to head and neck. TMJ pain, infected tooth and systemic problems like heart disorders can also lead to radiating pain in teeth. Without clinical examination, it is difficult to give definite diagnosis. You can visit your dentist for definite diagnosis and treatment. If there is gum infection present, then dental cleaning, root planning and periodontal surgery can be done for the tooth. If impacted wisdom tooth is reason of radiating pain, then surgical extraction of wisdom tooth can be done. If tooth is infected, then treatment is done for infected tooth.

Persistent right maxillary mucosal thickening with interval packing material 3. Mild left maxillary and bilateral anterior ethmoid mucosal thickening. Can you please tell me what this all means. Thank you, Anita","Doctor":"Hello there...Osteomyelitis of maxilla is usually seen in patients undergoing extractions with a chronic history of maxillary sinusitis or pan sinusitis. Patients with chronic sinusitis have to be treated with appropriate antibiotics as a prophylactic measure to prevent post extraction complications such as osteomyelitis being one amongst them. I have recently operated 2 cases of osteomyelitis of left maxilla with same clinical presentation. Maxillary sinus is a void space that fills up the middle part of face, just above the maxillary bone on both the sides that keeps the air humid and moist and makes the skull feel very light. It is covered by an epithelial lining that purifies the air we breathe in. In chronic cases of infections or sinusitis the lining thickens and stops functioning normally. The same way there are other sinuses such as ethmoidal, sphenoidal sinuses and so on. All of them have the same function. Owing to the infection there is accumulation of pus that gives a heavy feeling in that side of the face. This causes radiation pain over that side of maxillary teeth. Most of the dentists fail to diagnose and end up extracting the maxillary teeth. This most oftenly manifests in the form of osteomyelitis. what was the reason behind getting your teeth extracted?please mention it.... Osteomyelitis is the inflammation of the bone where bone fails to get its normal blood supply eventually leading to necrosis of the bone. That requires a surgical correction. Please consult a Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon for clinical evaluation."},{"Patient":"I have had lower right wisdom tooth extracted two weeks ago. I had to take augmentin for infection also for last four days. Right now I am not able to open my mouth more than two fingers. The dentist had advised me to try to increase opening my mouth by using increasing numbers of icecream sticks. Is it advisable? How long does it take to recover and what is the line of treatment? AAAA","Doctor":"Difficulty in mouth opening can occur after wisdom teeth extraction due to muscle trismus. TMJ dysfunction may also rarely occur after wisdom tooth extraction and can lead to difficulty in mouth opening. In case of muscle Trismus, patient is advised to stretch his mouth. In stretching of mouth you don’t have to wide open the mouth but open the mouth till pain is there and don’t go beyond that. If you can easily put your 3 fingers in mouth that means the opening is normal and if it is less then you have to try to open more and more gradually till you are able to put 3 fingers in the mouth.TMJ dysfunction after teeth extraction is unusual and temporary and to treat condition, heat therapy, anti-inflammatory meds and splint therapy can be given. You can continue with warm saline rinses for faster healing to take place. Keep tooth extraction socket area clean to avoid any secondary infections. It may take 3 weeks to 3 months for complete healing of wisdom tooth extraction socket to take place depending on method of teeth extraction and trauma to supporting tissues during tooth extraction. If mouth opening doesn’t seem to get better, then you can visit your oral surgeon for evaluation."},{"Patient":"Dear Dentists, I had the right upper molar nr.1 extracted 3 weeks ago as the tooth was originally filled in a long time ago and the filling fell out then the tooth broke down. So there were 2 smaller pieces of tooth extracted and also the 3rd bigger piece was extracted. It was an easy extraction, took 3 mins. The dentist pulled out the tooth and she told me she might not be able to do the extraxtion as my jaw is very narrow and the tooth is close to my sinus I guess, but she did it. The place of the tooth healed very nicely though it was bleeding a lot directly after the extraction. Then the around 6 days after the extraction on the roof of my mouth close to he gum of the etxracted tooth. It felt like a tiny breadcrumb is stuck there, but it wasn\`t I checked it with my tongue . Then I had clogged ear on the extraction site, sometimes a feeling of having a lump or something in my troat which sometimes makes me difficult to swallow on the right side . I My gums were and are not inflammed. The little breadrcumb thing on the gum /roof of mouth changed it\`s shape. It\`s hardened and the flattened or maybe moved. It gets harder like the gum and when I touch it with my tongue I feel no pain at all. Is maybe something in my gum, I remember used the gauze for 3 hours after extraction and it pulled my tooth when I changed it in every 20 mins as the dentist said. Eveyr time I changed it ( it was dry , the dentist didn\`t tell me I need to make it wet as I figured it out later and every time I chnaged it I felt a pain at one point of the tooth around the area where the 3rd piece of tooth turned and twisted and extracted by the dentist. Could you please tell me what is causing the clogged ear and the difficulty of swallowing sometimes on the side of the extraction? I am 3 weeks after the extraction now. The blood clot is developing nicely I can feel it with my tongue, but it\`s still softer than the gum. Is that normal? I am still doing the warm salt water rinsing since the 2nd day after the extraction. I also developed something on to top of my tongue, like red patches , it feels like I burned it but didn\`t eat anything like that not even spicy. What is that? Should I worry about that or it goes away by itself? Thanks in advance for your answer Judit","Doctor":"Hi Welcome to HCM I went through your history & would like to tell you that post extraction there is pain & swelling, difficulty in swallowing in some cases & its nothing to worry about.Healing requires time & there is formation of granulation tissue that appears whitish in color. Later on it merges with normal gingiva. Still if you feel that something is inside then you should get an IOPA done of associated region. Meanwhile you can do warm saline rinses. You also mentioned that you are experiencing burning sensation in tongue & that might be due to side-effects of antibiotic that you might be taking.I would suggest you to take some multi-vitamin therapy for that & avoid spicy food.Consult your dentist for further problem.

There is no definite cause of canker sores but it is known that bacterial infections, vitamin deficiency, allergies etc can lead to canker sores.  Without clinical examination, it is difficult to give definite diagnosis. If there is throat infection present, then you can visit your physician for treatment. If there is acute gum infection present which has lead to these symptoms, then dental cleaning and or periodontal surgery will be required to correct it. In case of gum infection, maintain good oral hygiene by brushing and flossing regularly and also use a mouth wash. You can also do warm saline rinses 3-4 times a day to reduce the gum swelling. Canker sores are self limiting and will heal on its own in 7-10 days. If canker sores are causing pain, then you can apply orajel over it.

This will result in less toothbrush abrasion to the tooth surface and less irritation to your gums. Brush gently and carefully around the gum line so you do not remove more gum tissue.Frequent consumption of highly acid foods can gradually dissolve tooth enamel and lead to dentin exposure. They may also aggravate the sensitivity and start the pain reaction.Daily use of a fluoridated mouth rinse can decrease sensitivity. Ask your dentist about available products for home use.Get professional tooth cleaning, oral hygiene instructions, and fluoride treatments every six months (or sooner depending on your condition)."},{"Patient":"Hi.

There is no swelling , or odors, or anything else.","Doctor":"chewing is a process where upper & lower teeth come in contact with each other & help in churning the food. so when the upper wisdom tooth is removed, then the lower tooth will not help you in chewing, instead if you keep that lower tooth for many years then it might harm its adjacent tooth because of occlusal drift. occlusal drift means that when the opposing tooth is absent, the tooth slowly starts moving up.this will probably take few years, so if you can't afford the removal right now then you can get it removed even after 8-10 months or even an year. For the pain which you are having, usually after wisdom tooth removal pain persists for about a week, but in few difficult cases pain will be there for about 10-13 days. It  is a good thing there is no swelling. the dull aching pain will reduce as the healing process slowly completes.

Is it cotton or part of the paste","Doctor":"dry socket is because after extraction  the blood clot got dislodged from the socket. so ideally the dry socket should be curetted which means it should be cleaned & irrigated with medicine & obtundent dressing which is already given to you must be placed. the brown discharge or paste is the dressing. it will take around a week for the pain to subside. you should go for regular dressings, & maintain that area clean. food lodgement in the socket can again cause infection & give more trouble. use betadine mouthwash twice a day to help in healing. betadine should be diluted with equal amount of water, & after rinsing with it you should not intake water for atleast 20  mins."},{"Patient":"Hi ... i have seveor pain in my 30th # lower teeth since 5 days i used lots of medicines but effect of those medication is limited till 5 to 6 hrs only after that again pain starts... just an hour ago i visited to my dentist , he prescribed me Moxikind cv. 625, sartin d, and ketrol DT. are these medication is good cure my problem.... kindly help me","Doctor":"Hello, WC to Health Care Magic It is difficult to diagnose from the description you have given.

My dizziness , as I thought, maybe is caused by my astigmatism , but my taste buds are weird, like as if I have fever , there s a metallic taste in my mouth but I ve checked my temperature and it s normal. This started happening yesterday night. And I get tired easily. I m only 14","Doctor":"Metallic taste/ dysgeusia is distorted sense of taste in mouth. It can occur because of poor oral hygiene, aging, mouth breathing, smoking, dry mouth or because of certain infections like common cold, sinusitis, salivary gland infections, sore throat, streptococcal throat, viral infections. It can also occur because of tongue biting, head nose or mouth injury or chemical poisoning. At times ortho appliances, nasal polyps, allergies, Bell ’s palsy etc also causes metallic taste. Certain antibiotics, antithyroid drugs and bronchodilators can also cause metallic taste. The most common cause of metallic taste in mouth is bad oral hygiene or infections in mouth. So you are advised to maintain a good oral hygiene. Brush your teeth twice a day, floss, clean your tongue properly. You can also use an antimicrobial mouthwash for this. If the condition persists even after maintaining a good oral hygiene, then you need to consult your dentist. Your dentist after clinical diagnosis will find out the cause for the condition and will treat it."},{"Patient":"I have had a painful toothache in my front right top tooth, it started thursday night i called my dentist and the earliest he could see me is monday, at that point it felt like a cavity so I was not that worried. it has been getting progressively worse, face swelling , lips swelling, pain from my tooh up my nose and into my eye and right temple.

Hi Dr. Bhatti, Please bear with me, rather slow typing on IPad. Rather long history in attempt to resolve my problem with no avail. Root canal performed by dentist in 2007. Will have to refer to record for exact date. After root canal performed had to travel out of town to attend funeral. During lengthy vehicle travel, experienced fluid drainage from upper right side if mouth. Repeatedly having to spit, bad taste. While staying at hotel noticed small blue particles in fluid. Also experienced severe headaches, burning of mouth, redness of tissue on face (I have photos) extending to bridge over nose. During this time, Rheumatologist had perscribed Cellcept (Feb 2007-Feb 2008). Had tonsillectomy w/ adenoids removed Feb 2008). Tonsils positive for actinomycetes. Extreme pain, swelling redness resulted in 16 root canals within 6 months. No periodontal disease , always healthy, never smoked, no alcohol, not over weight and dental check ups, cleaning ex rays every 6 months through out life time. All root canals failed, and extracted one by one. Tooth number 5 was tooth that abscessed initially. Deep tissue biopsy of area in April of 2012 positive for anerobic bacteria. Oral Surgeon did not request identification on order, therefore, anerobic bacteria not identified or treated. Constant pain, with immediate flare, redness and swelling upon eating aand drinking. Numerous CT Scans, MRI s, have identified activity. Have been sent from specialist to specialist for past 4 years, all the while suffering pain, drainage to the point of nearly giving up. Constant draining from mouth, difficulty sleeping, mucus thick, chocking. Physically, lethargy, unable to work and have any life whatsoever. Presently, seeking to travel to large metro area for assessment at teaching hospital. Very ill, weak, etc. condition debilatating. Questions or suggestions?","Doctor":"Your signs and symptoms described reveal that you have some chronic infections in your mouth which are bothering.  First of all forget about individual teeth having problem but just concentrate on improving your oral hygiene.  If there are active infections with symptoms like pain, fever, visible pus discharge, start one course of antibiotics under the guidance of some doctor.  I cannot prescribe antibiotics here because I cannot decide you one will suit you better.  Next, if you dont have these active signs but just constant irritation or mild pain, start improving your oral hygiene with the help of mouthwashes or just warm salt water gargling 3 times a day (provided you are not hypertensive).  The oral rinses containing hydrogen peroxide are very good to tackle infections, so check with your pharmacy if they have one.  Next step is consulting again your dentist and starting some treatments to address these.  Your weakness maybe due to lack of appetite or inadequate nutrition.  You can take some B complex vitamins to address this.  Start eating properly and if you have problem eating because of one or 2 teeth, ask your dentist to correct them.  I am sure this should solve your problems.  All the Best!!!"},{"Patient":"i doctor i had the habbit of chewing pan and then i quit it completely after nearly 9 months i just started agin and it s again 15-days, i seriously want to quit it, i associated my habit with so many things which i find near and dear if i quit this this will happen....(good or bad), i promised on myself, and people close to me and god too...but again i pacify myself in giving excuses....i already spoiled my teeth and underwent treatment and i was so happy when i quit now i re-started and feel so guilty and i really want to kick it out from my life forever.....( i don t smoke or drink,and dosn t have any other habits...)","Doctor":"if you are having this this habit since many years, then suddenly quitting it is not a good idea. it will hamper your mental peace & balance, you get depressed at times or become very restless. so first slowly try reducing the no. of pan you eat everyday. for eg. if you eat 3-4 pan per day  then for a month make it 2, then next month make it 1, then after few months make it  1 alternative days, then later on cut down to 1 pan in 2 or 3 days. like this slowly quitting the habit will help you for long term rather than suddenly quitting."},{"Patient":"I have been having slightly runny green poo and it smells for the last 4 days and now running a temperature, with a few stomach cramps.

She gave me a filling in two teeth...both the second last molar from the back on the upper left and right side. The filling on the left has given me no trouble since but the one on the right has been painful ever since, not all the time but when I am eating food. I went back to a different dentist on Tuesday (as the other one was a few hours away from where I work) and he filed down the filling for me as it was a little high. However, it is still hurting when I eat...could you advise as to why this is? Could the filling have irritated the nerve or something, or do you think it just needs a while to settle down?","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for your question. You have little ligaments around the tooth called periodontal ligaments.  This flex up and down when you bite firmly against them.  When you get a filling that is high, you have more pressure onto these ligaments leading to pain and inflammation.  The longer you have this trauma the longer it takes to heal.  The tooth may be adjusted correctly and you need to have the inflammation go down.  Give your tooth some rest and allow it to heal for several weeks.  It can take 3 weeks for this pain to subside.  If it doesn't get better or gets worse, do not hesitate to be reevaluated.  Best wishes.

Even you have not mentioned any more symptoms related to it which shows absence of pain & discomfort.

The pain could be related to remaining infection in the tooth you have had done, or the tooth next to it was the one needing the root canal.  The level of pain you are experiencing means you have a dying nerve and are suffering from irreversible pulpitis.

But it can't account for wait gain of 5 pounds.Your wait gain may be due to some other reason like due to some dietary habit or any other systemic disease.Consult your physician for further opinion.

Caught it early and got antibiotics yo fight the infection. Was not givin pain killers but have been smoking weed to counter act the pain. With this have and adverse affect on the healing process? Also should i not smoke cigarettes? I know i shouldnt smoke at all but thats not the question. I just want to know is smoking a cigarette will impede the healing process!","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for your question. It is extremely foolish to smoke in general.  It is foolish to smoke either cigarettes or marijuana especially when healing from a tooth abscess.  The smoke is full of chemicals that hinder the healing process by causing vasoconstriction of the blood vessels going to the area that provide the antibodies needed to fight the infection as well as the repairative material that rebuilds the damaged tissue.  The suction of the smoking and the smoke itself can cause destruction of the blood clot leading to a very painful dry socket.  The smoking also reduces the ability of your body to fight the infection and prevents optimal levels of the antibiotic to get to the area. Take NSAIDs instead to help with pain and swelling.

My parents have fervent disagreements because some people happened to be blind after their dental extraction (esp in the upper jaw, which related to the eye s nerves). I m currently doing a research of the correlation between upper teeth and eye, some cases happened to be blind, some say it is not true, some agree that it is true. I m so confused right now, this is one of the vital decisions I would ever make, which affects my whole entire life. So, please give me the precise answer, I would appreciate it. Thanks in advance! Donna Lu.","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for your question. This is not true.  Your nerves for vision are distant, encased in bone and not associated with your teeth.  I have not heard of anyone becoming blind after an extraction of a tooth unless an instrument was dropped into the eyeball of the patient.  Even so I still have not heard of a case such as this, but I'm sure it has happened.  We have our patients wear eye protection at all times.  In our consent forms if this was a risk we would have it in there.  I have not seen a single form with risk of eye damage. Blindness may occur if you get an infection in the socket, don't come in for treatment and acquire orbital cellulitis which can lead to blindness. I think you can rest easy knowing you won't go blind getting your teeth extracted. Remember the saying \\"Don't believe everything you see on the internet\\" - Abraham Lincoln.

I had noticed some periodic tenderness when I brushed that area, but I thought it was just an irritated gum. After the decay was found, an x-ray was taken of the tooth (which took three tries because of the difficulty of getting a good view of the tooth). The x-ray showed quite a lot of decay inside the tooth, but there is no decay on the outside. My dentist said that is pretty rare, but can happen due to bacteria getting inside the tooth. I have always taken good care of my teeth , and the others are in good shape, so I m really surprised and upset that this has happened. Previous x-rays didn t show any problem with this tooth, so this must be something that has developed pretty quickly. The options I was given were 1) Do nothing for now (I don t want to do this) 2) Do root canal and a crown, which would cost maybe 2500 total and require several appointments; or 3) tooth extraction. The affected tooth is above a bottom molar that has never come in fully, and the two teeth don t meet for much chewing. I also had an impacted wisdom tooth removed behind that area years ago, and that area will always be tender. Bottom line is that I can t and don t chew much directly on those back teeth on that side. I really hate to lose that tooth, but I m also reluctant to start down that root canal/crown road with the expense (I don t have dental insurance) and the possibility of trouble with it later.

Thanks!","Doctor":"well as you already said you are hating to spend the money but from the bottom of your heart you know what you require - ROOT CANAL . about the xray i have to say that it is not rare because dental decay is usually like this what appears on top is just like the tip of an iceberg. the decay is much greater inside. so trusting by your hygienist who should not be doing a root canal you require a root canal. however you can delay it with painkillers if it pains , but keep the area very clean. thanks"},{"Patient":"I got my wisdom teeth out Monday (3 of them) and on the bottom right it s just very messy looking.

Tea tree oil has very good healing and antibacterial properties which would help alleviate the pain and kill the bacteria. You only need about 6-8 tablespoons of salt and about a cup of water.

It had been 5 years since I had seen a dentist (I m 26), and I expected to have a few cavities since I know no matter how well you take care of your teeth, there is no guarantee that you will never have a cavity. I picked a random dentist to go to, since I live in a different city now and can t go to my old dentist. I ended up having to get 4 white fillings for the teeth in the bottom left part of my mouth. I had pain in my jaw and teeth the next day, but assumed that was normal and waited a week. I had to go back 2 more times so she could check it out and try to fix it. She tried to adjust the bite, but both times I had zero relief. The main reason I was getting worried was because the dentist nor her office were very professional. Every visit I had to wait 2 hours to see her, with an empty waiting room, and empty back rooms (it was an open office/cubicle type deal). I ve always been very comfortable with dentists, so I was trying to give her the benefit of the doubt, but after a total of 4 visits I decided to try a different dentist. The next dentist was super nice, I got in fast, but he took xrays and said that the fillings looked okay. He then told me about/showed me a cavity that I needed to get filled ASAP, and he was a little upset that she completely missed it, cause it could have gotten really bad if neglected. So, I let him give me an amalgam filling in the top right portion of my mouth. Now, I have pain in both areas! It s a constant jaw/ toothache , but when I chew or drink anything cold, it s a sharp pain in both areas. Sometimes my ears are even affected, kind of like a mild ear infection , and it s fuzzy and sort of muffled. I ve been taking ibuprofen and tylenol (alternating) and waiting it out to see if the amalgam side gets better after a week or two. I ve read things about both types of fillings and how it usually takes a few weeks for the root to get used to the new filling, but it s been over a month with the white fillings and just a week with the silver, and I the pain hasn t subsided at all. It hasn t gotten worse, so I guess that could be good. I m waiting one more week on the amalgam, and if it still hurts, I m going to call the dentist and let him know. I m getting a little worried about all of this, and am starting to fear dentists! When I was 8, I busted my front tooth and had to get a bonding, and I didn t have a hard time with that, so I don t think it s my pain tolerance . I just really need some advice, for piece of mind! Help!","Doctor":"Dear rebecca.eve.underhill as far as i understood your situation,there are 2 possibilities 1-there is over filling of tooth,this should be checked properly by the dentist. 2-there is microleakage in filling causing innervation of nerve fibres in tooth when you drink something cold and seems cavity is very deep that is near or about to touch the pulp chamber,as whenever you eat something all your occlusal pressure goes to the pulp chamber leading to pain,in this type of condition filling is not advisable your dentist should go for the root canal treatment of the tooth after radiographic examinition. i hope its clear to you have a good health,take care,cheers"},{"Patient":"Hi I am 41 years old. I exercise regularly. My resting heart rate is 50bpm. I am 5ft 7inches tall. weigh 65 kg. After 35 minute training session on a bike yesterday I felt a sharp pain in lower left abdomen. has continued today but only seems to happen when I am seated or adjust my position when seated. Localised pain above left hip to the left of abdomenal muscle. It is only a fleeting sharp pain but wondered if it is something I should get checked out. I eat a diet of steamed white fish with steamed brocoli and new potatoes every day. Lunch is rice and tuna, every day too. I don't drink alcohol during the week but do enjoy a glass of red, or two on a weekend. I use a heart rate monitor during exercise and noticed yesterday my resting heart rate was 39bpm. normally around the 50bpm mark but dropped to 45 last week. not sure if that is relevant but thought I would mention it. Many thanks David","Doctor":"Hi David.Thanks for your query.Read the history and understood your problem.Sharp pain in the left lower abdomen, more so if in seated position or on adjustment of position in the chair, localized pain above the left hip to left abdominal muscles indicates that you should get this checked by a Doctor, preferably a Surgeon. Such type of pain can be a local problem of the muscles or a compression of the spinal cord by disc and causing the neurological referred pain.I would advise you the following:Examination by a SurgeonMRI of the spineOpinion of a PhysiotherapistFurther treatment as per the clinical examination and the reports. The cardiac problem , slow heart beats must be checked by the Caridologist and investigated further for opinion and treatment,"},{"Patient":"Hi i would like inform u that i have a problem of h .pori what are the medicine or do u have any injection couse of pain killer","Doctor":"Hello H.

Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for posting your query. This pain came from a cavity that had virtually reached the root. you have to visit dentist for root canal treatment if there is no other cause i.e. fracture. Till then you can apply  tea tree oil and a clean medicine dropper. With care, put 3-4 drops of the oil onto the affected tooth/teeth and leave it for at least 30 minutes. Tea tree oil has very good healing and antibacterial properties which would help alleviate the pain and kill the bacteria. You only need about 6-8 tablespoons of salt and about a cup of water. Just wait for the salt to completely dissolve before you gargle the solution for about 1-2 minutes. Repeating the process a few times may be necessary to make the pain subside significantly.

They drilled, got the puss out, suctioned and what not. Im going back on the 31st for the second visit im guessing for a cap? What will they do now? Will i need a shot this time or..?","Doctor":"hello and welcome, since you do not have pain in your first visit while removing pulp tissue which is non-vital,you will not get pain in your following visits too. in case of root canal treatment,more chance of getting pain is in first visit,ie,while removing pulp in the canal. since the tooth is non-vital,in next visit,biomechanical preparation using k-and h-files and cleaning and shaping of canals using saline-sodium hypochlorite solution has to be done. then after drying the canal using paper points,it has to be obturated with gutta-percha points using sealer by lateral condensation technique. take complete antibiotics-analgesics course. regards dr.bindiya"},{"Patient":"Had my wisdom teeth removed in Saturday.

This might be dry socket (Alveolar osteitis) , a painful phenomenon that most commonly occurs a few days following the removal of mandibular (lower) wisdom teeth. It occurs because the blood clot within the healing tooth extraction site is disrupted. A dry socket typically causes a sharp and sudden increase in pain commencing 2–5 days following the extraction of a mandibular molar, most commonly the third molar. Because dry socket is not an infection, the use of antibiotics has no effect on it. You can take anti-inflammatory drug like ibuprofen after discussing with your dentist.

Most canker sores go away on their own in a week or two. Check with your doctor or dentist if you have unusually large or painful canker sores or canker sores that don't seem to heal.

Thanks","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for posting your query. Since you had a complicated extraction procedure,the pain and difficulty will be more in such cases. The extraction socket and surrounding tissue may be completely worn out. You need more care and rest to heal the socket soon. The pain also can be due to arise of dry socket. Obtundant dressing using zinc oxide eugenol and iodoform gauze should be given. dressing must be changed daily. Take warm saline gargle frequently. betadine irrigation of socket will help to remove the debridement. Do not irritate the area using finger/toothpick as it can delay healing. Maintain good oral hygiene. You may take Diclomol and hopefully your pain should subside. In addition icing the part might give added benefits.

There isnt any pain or anything and I think use a little bit of force I may be able to pull it out....I am positive that it is not food. Should I be worried about this? Should I take it out?","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to HCM I read you query & would like to clarify that bleeding can be due to some food lodgement in associated area.In case of orthodontic treatment you need to take special care of your oral hygiene. Don't experiment anything by your own & when you go for next appointment get it checked. Meanwhile start using 0.2%chlorhexidine mouthwash 10ml half an hour after brushing. Maintain proper oral hygiene as well. Take Care Regards Dr.Neha"},{"Patient":"what happens if someone eats white pus from a pimple?","Doctor":"Certainly this is not advicable..

It sounds like you have an active infection called pericoronitis.  You need to have your wisdom teeth inspected by a dentist and most likely extracted at this time.  The risk of keeping them in is that this infection could lead to a more severe one rapidly. Best Wishes and Good Health Dr. Ward"},{"Patient":"I have been experience tooth/gum/jaw pain for almost two weeks now. I have good oral health, just had a cleaning about a month ago, xrays were done and no decay was found. I used a whitening tooth paste for about 3 days and it seems like that is when the pain may have started but it could be complete coincidence. I stopped using it, am now using sensodyne and have even changed my toothbrush (soft). The dull ache seems to now be more focused on my lower front teeth but does tend to travel here and there. Today I chewed a piece of gum and it actually made the pain go away for a little bit. The pain is constant. A dull ache, no sharp or shooting pain at all. My gums seems to be whiter in color also. Please help. I am taking advil and even 3 of them at a time is not making the ache go away.","Doctor":"Hello & welcome, The pain you are experiencing right now seems more likely due to sensitivity caused by teeth cleaning which you have undergone a month ago. This happens prominently in patients whose teeth are covered by large amount of plaque or even there is calculus formation on the teeth surface. In such cases, gingiva recesses from it's normal position to some what lower position due to inflammation exposing that part of the tooth which is covered with gingiva all the time. This makes the tooth more sensitive & it is most commonly seen after scaling or cleaning of the teeth specially in Lower Anterior teeth. Visit your dentist as soon as possible to evaluate the condition clinically & get appropriate treatment done accordingly. Controlled release painkillers would provide more relief as compared to other drugs. Avoid chilled or cold water or drinks as this may aggravate the pain. Use soft tooth brush. You may make the bristles more soft by dipping them in warm water for a few seconds just before brushing. Use warm water to rinse your mouth after brushing instead of cold water. Yes, Anti hypersensitivity toothpaste is also useful but its use should be for prolonged period to get complete benefit. Take care."},{"Patient":"hi , i have 3 bumps directly under the surface under my tongue and behind my bottom front teeth . first one on the way down is in the middle . then one (the biggest on the right maybe 1/10 inch) then one on the left. they are not painful at all. infact they are pleasureful to push on and i feel like i want to crush them. maybe related to stress they do have quite a bit of free moving space and are like fleshy and then hard inside. any ideas?","Doctor":"Hello & welcome, If you have no pain in the bumps, that means those are not really harmful or they are not associated with certain infection. Bumps on the area behind the lower anteriors may be so called torus mandibularis which is abnormal growth of mandibular bone lingualy and their presence is absolutely harmless . This growth can be seen most likely in the premolar area of the mandible. If it is bigger in size than usual, it may interfere with the function of the tongue or patient may feel discomfort due to it. No treatment is necessary as such. Only you can do is to visit your dentist & get clinically examined to rule out any other problem related to floor of the mouth below tongue. Normally salivary gland ducts & their openings can also feel like bumps if they are slightly bigger in size, but this condition is very rare & patient may not even notice it. Don't ever try to push them or or put pressure on them as there are chances of getting hurt & it may then get infected later on. Just keep your oral cavity clean by proper brushing techniques & even by use of antiseptic mouthwash occasionally. Take care."},{"Patient":"so in october I got all four of my wisdom teeth removed and I got an infection from where I hadnt gotten the stitches out soon on the left side of my jaw where a lump formed.

Sn july I was feeling the bump and now.its gotten bigger and hurts for everythinh when before it would just hurt to light pressure. My cheek is a little swollen now and you can see the outline of it. I dont know whether its infected or just swollen . It feels heavy.especially when I wake up from sleeping","Doctor":"Hello & welcome, As you have undergone extensive procedure of wisdom teeth removal , swelling and infection are the conditions commonly associated with it after the procedure. If there is lump present, that clearly indicates the presence of associated infection & sometimes it might become quiet painful. Visit your dentist who removed your wisdom teeth, get clinical examination thoroughly done to diagnose any remaining suture material in the wound or presence of any type of secondary infection. Antibiotics & Anti-inflammatory drugs are very vital in such condition to arrest the infection from spreading in surrounding tissue. Even, if your dentist finds that the infection is severe, then Antibiotics might be needed to be administered by intra-venous rout for faster results. Don't take these drugs without consulting your dentist as random use of the drugs may worsen the situation. Keep your oral cavity clean as much as possible with proper use of brushing done regularly & with antiseptic mouthwash. Avoid hot fomentation or eating hot food or drinking hot drinks like tea & coffee as heat may aggravate the swelling. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, well this is hard to explain, my gum is a little swollen and it hurts, only in one spot though, in the very back, and i noticed that between my tooth and the gum there was something stuck there, as soon as i take it out it was something white that didn t have a normal smell, i don t know if it could be rests of food or what, i need help, also i would like to know, i ve been very paranoid because some of my tooth feel just a little bit loose, should i be worried?","Doctor":"hello it seem your gums have got highly inflammed called gingivitis. this occur because of food acculumation in between gums and teeth because of improper cleening under the action of bacteria gums get inflammed leading to swelling tooth loosening bleeding foul smell.white hard material may be calculus , it is a calcified structure stuck on tooth in case of bad oral hygiene.i would advice you to go for deep cleanin of your teeth called scaling ,use betadiene mouthrinse twice daily and learn the proper brushin technique. regards dr.sapna"},{"Patient":"I have had trouble with my 6th right molar for about 3 years.

After reading your symptoms, it looks like an abcess to me. Sometimes if the infection has been there for a long time and is only subdued due to repeated medicines then it becomes chronic and therefore may appear as a hard lump.

Hope you feel better soon. Regards"},{"Patient":"Lately I have been having serious foamy spit. It sucks because I can t go anywhere without having to keep spitting others wise if i swallow it the bubbles give a bad stomach ache. And yes too much air in the belly does not feel good. It s as if I washed out my mouth with hydrogen peroxide because its very thick and it s only a matter of seconds before I need to spit again. My saliva is filled with hundreds of tiny bubbles and its very white. My mom says I m too acidic is this true. Idk if that s possible because I eat pretty healthy and I ve never had this before and it keeps getting worse its been going on for almost a month now so please help!","Doctor":"Hello & welcome,Foam like substance in the spit along with stomach discomfort indicates the presence of digestion problem though your are eating healthy. Digestion irregularities are associated with increased acidity in the stomach which in turn may present with foamy saliva.This is because, if whatever we eat, is not digested properly, naturally body has to produce more & more acid to digest the food we ate. Now, during sleep this acid containing fluid is being regurgitated by the patient making the throat & oral cavity sore. To compensate this soreness or irritation, large amount of saliva is produced by body to wash the mucosal lining. You should visit your dentist to evaluate the condition clinically to get the proper diagnosis as treatment will be varying depending upon it.Keep your oral cavity clean as much as you can. Avoid over eating. Though food is healthy, over eating may make you suffer from indigestion.Use of Anti Acidic drugs are of special importance but should be taken after visiting your dentist or your Physician only.Take care."},{"Patient":"My bottom right teeth hurt when i chew on my right side.

During the day, when I m not eating, it just feels sore. I dont have redness or swelling in my mouth nor on my neck.","Doctor":"Hello & welcome, Actually giving advise on your condition without clinical examination is difficult as symptoms mentioned are not very clear. Still, i will put the best out from whatever you mentioned. First, if you are having pain in lower teeth ,there might be caries associated with a single or multiple teeth which should be diagnosed soon. Visit your dentist to evaluate your oral cavity clinically. Check whether there is an impacted or partially erupted third molar on lower right side of the jaw. This is because, third molars which are partially erupted or which are fully impacted may present with such painful symptoms especially when these molars are inclined mesially or horizontally. Such horizontally or mesially impacted third molars put heavy pressure on the front tooth which then transmits the force to all the teeth present mesial to it. Partially erupted molars usually have a flap of mucosa covering them underneath which food tends to accumulates thereby infection the area. This presents with soreness in the oral cavity specially on the affected side. Soreness below jaw bone may be due to infection being drained in associated sbmandibular or sublingual lymph nodes. Pain on eating may be associated with periodontal fibers of the teeth being traumatized due infection or biting any hard objects. Visit your dentist, get x-ray done to confirm the diagnosis. Keep your oral cavity clean always to avoid accumulation of the plaque & food debris which may aggravate the situation. Use of antibiotics or any other drugs will be decided by your dentist only after thorough examination. Take care."},{"Patient":"I have a dental question.

However, there is does not resolve my pain.","Doctor":"your suspicion seems to be right. it  seems the way the upper and lower teeth interact with each other is not correct . this is also causing jaw discomfort. get yourself examined by an occlusion specialist as this is an intricate matter and not all dentists understand occlusion very well."},{"Patient":"I have had, i guess you call it an infection, on the roof of my mouth.

I get a incredible headache when i eat. What could this be?( i have had my bottom two wisdom teeth out but still have the top two)","Doctor":"Hello & welcome, Your symptoms of swelling on palatal side of upper anterior tooth ( incisor ) shows the presence of underlying abscess or pus formation around the tooth. This can occur more likely due to deep caries in the tooth which has propagated through dentine &  reached the live pulp tissue of the tooth thus infecting it. Another possibility is just a Gum infection or periodontal infection which is deep seated in below cervical line of the tooth or this may be due to trauma to periodontium or the tooth itself. First of all, get an x-ray taken by visiting your dentist to evaluate the presence of caries & abscess or the periodontal condition of the tooth. Root canal treatment will be best if there is abscess due to caries followed by ceramic crown placement. If the fault is within the periodontium or Gingival infection, then Scaling & root planing will suffice. Antibiotics are definitely required to get rid of infection & will be given to you by your dentist. Avoid hot food stuff intake or hot drinks like Tea & coffee until swelling subsides completely. Keep your oral cavity clean by properly brushing your teeth regularly. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello, I have been having a problem with a bitter and burning sensation in the back of my throat along with a sulfur taste and smell coming from my stomach...is this GERD?","Doctor":"Yes...

One of the stitches in my gum came out today, the spot where the stitch was has had a lump all along. The stitch is gone but the lump is still there. It doesn t hurt at all and it s not discolored. Is it normal for there to be some swelling just from the stitch being there or do I need to have the lump looked at?","Doctor":"Hello & welcome, Sutures are generally removed  7 - 10 days after removal of wisdom tooth without any problem. You already have completed 10 days after extraction so sutures should be looked for removal now. Yes, having a lump or swelling all along  the extraction wound is quiet normal but only for a week after extraction & not more than that. Swelling in your case might be due to sutures are still there or wound have got infected secondarily. Remember one important thing, sutures though necessary for proper approximation of wound flaps, if not removed on correct time, increases the chances of wound getting infected several times. This can also happen if oral hygiene is not maintained properly by the patient. So, look for proper cleaning with soft brush to avoid damage to your wound. Use of Local Antiseptic mouth wash is preferred here to rinse oral cavity thereby removing any accumulated food debris which may infect the wound. Visit you dentist to get the wound clinically examined. Antibiotics may be given if the infection is slightly on higher side. But that too, depends on your dentist's perception. Avoid forceful gargling after brushing or even after eating food. Take soft food until swelling subsides. Even blowing air forcefully may hurt your wound so should be avoided. Take care."},{"Patient":"I just had 6 molars extracted out of my mouth on Friday morning. It is now Sunday night. I had an infection in 2 of the molars on the bottom right side. I finished a full prescription of antibiotics before the teeth were pulled, but i do believe that the infection was still there a little bit. Well, it is now the third day after the teeth were pulled, and the one side seems like it is healing just fine, where the other side, where i had 4 teeth pulled, 2 on top, and 2 on bottom, seems to be healing differently. There is a thick white film over the two teeth that had the infection, covering the hole where the teeth were pulled from, and all i can see is white. Is that normal??

The whitish film that you observe is a part of healing known as granulation tissue.You don't worry for that & regarding dry socket i would like to ask you that whether you have history of smoking? The blood clot’s formation can be slowed down when a person smokes, either from the suction done during the smoking action, or from the chemical toxins that come from a cigarette. This can lead to complications such as a dry socket, which is a temporary and very painful condition that occurs when the blood clot forms slowly. Take some rest & start with amoxiclav-625 twice a day along with zerodol-SP twice a day.Also take some multivitamin & antacid like rabeprazole 20 mg if acidity persists.Also do warm saline rinses 3-4 times a day.

Never ever do this again as allergic reactions go on increasing in the severity with each episode & you may put yourself in life threatening situation. Now, your face & cheeks are swelled along with tongue & throat that's hurting that means you are in advanced stage of infection because of fractured tooth which is acting as main focus of infection. Only piece of crab remaining in oral cavity can not present with such swelling unless it's an allergic reaction itself. So, as you are in advanced stage of infection, intake of Antibiotics & painkiller on your own is not at all advisable here. Visit your dentist as quick as possible & get evaluated. This is because, if there is abscess formation it might need to be drained by incision which can be done by dentist only.

When I bite on the tooth if feels as though it is moving up and down and it is very tender. I am being told that I need to have a root canal and have the bridge made over. My problem is I don t have six-thousand dollars. Should my dentist be able to take off my existing bridge to perform the root canal and then put my old bridge back in place? Or is their a much more inexpensive to correct this problem. My dentist states that there is a space around the wisdom took which is allowing food and will, if it has not yet, cause decay.","Doctor":"Hello & welcome, Improper placement or making of the bridge, creates the problem which you are facing & that is food collection. Food accumulation around tooth or under the bridge causes decaying or caries in the abutment tooth (support tooth). And if you are getting the feeling of tooth going slightly down on application of pressure, then that particular tooth has been decayed to pulp level & there is abscess formation around the tooth. Abscess present around the tooth gives cushioning effect on application of pressure along with pain & swelling. If this is the case, it can definitely be treated with Root canal treatment followed by placement of new bridge with proper crown preparation by dentist. Definitely the role of antibiotics & painkillers is vital here as there is infection along with abscess formation. Yes you should go for making new bridge because doing root canal treatment only will not clear the main problem associated with the bridge ( gap underneath ). This can only be treated with repeated crown cutting & impression taken with due care by the dentist. If there is food accumulation around wisdom tooth which thereby infect it, you should go for x-ray & even extraction of the same tooth if dentist feels that prognosis is poor.

There can also be secondary caries associated with restored teeth. Pain can also be due to toothbrush injury because of hard brushing habit.

Since your symptoms are involving multiple system and entire tests are negative, there are strong possibilities that your symptoms could be due to anxiety.

I just had a large brownish bad smelling lump pop out of it, i felt an instant relief of pressure (not that I was aware of this sensation until now) but now the extraction site is sensitive and a throbbing sensation is there. What has happened?","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for your question. What you had pop out was either the blood clot that had formed when you had the tooth extracted or old food debris.  This is the same way the other parts of your body shed a scab.  This one happened to be in your mouth.  You are experiencing the sensitivity and throbbing because now you have raw tissue exposed to the outside environment.  This is a normal part of healing.  I would suggest rinsing your mouth out with warm salt water to help keeping the area clean and reduce the swelling.  10oz warm water, 1/2 tsp salt swish and spit 4-6 times a day especially after eating.  Also you can take NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, at this point I would take 600mg every 6 hours as needed for pain.  If the pain continues or gets worse, go into your dentist to be evaluated for infection formation.

Yes I trust the treatment plan that your dentist is providing based on the information given to me by you.  The tooth that is broken off at the gum line is serving no purpose and would be better removed than retained.  You are at an increased risk of infection and abscess formation leaving the broken tooth in.  when you get a bridge you need to have strong abutment teeth to hold the bridge in place.  If the teeth are mobile then they are not good candidates for bridge support.

I also notice it when i perform oral sex on my significant other.

It is directly associated with failure in maintaining oral hygiene to optimum level or due to faulty brushing & cleaning habits. First , visit your dentist for proper clinical examination to find out any other related cause if any. Get your teeth cleaned (scaling) by dentist thoroughly. Use soft tooth brush by applying light pressure against teeth surface. Use antiseptic mouth wash for short period. Even you can brush your teeth lightly after having your meals to remove any accumulated food debris which is difficult to remove with just gargles. You can use gum paints along with Antibiotics to reduce the bleeding from gingiva. Take care."},{"Patient":"I am 55, and not in the best physical condition of my life.

I do not feel physically exhausted, nor even particularly fatigued when this happens, but the choking sensation is preventing me from pushing myself further.","Doctor":"There are several causes of dry mouth, also called xerostomia. These include :- Side effect of certain medications: Dry mouth is a common side effect of many prescription and nonprescription drugs, including drugs used to treat depression, anxiety, pain, allergies, and colds . Side effect of certain diseases and infections: Dry mouth can be a side effect of medical conditions, including Sjögren's syndrome, HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, anemia, cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and mumps. Side effect of certain medical treatments.:Damage to the salivary glands, the glands that produce saliva, for example, from radiation to the head and neck and chemotherapy treatments for cancer, can reduce the amount of saliva produced. Nerve damage : Dry mouth can be a result of nerve damage to the head and neck area from an injury or surgery. Dehydration: Conditions that lead to dehydration, such as fever, excessive sweating, vomiting, diarrhea, blood loss, and burns can cause dry mouth. Surgical removal of the salivary glands. Lifestyle. Smoking or chewing tobacco can affect saliva production and aggravate dry mouth. Continuously breathing with your mouth open can also contribute to the problem. Steps you can take that may help improve saliva flow include:- Sucking on sugar-free candy or chewing sugar-free gum. Drinking plenty of water to help keep your mouth moist. Protecting your teeth by brushing with a fluoridetoothpaste, using a fluoride rinse, and visiting your dentist regularly. Breathing through your nose, not your mouth, as much as possible. Using a room vaporizer to add moisture to the bedroom air. Using an over-the-counter artificial saliva substitute. Hope I have answered your query.

There was a bout with infection in the gums where there were puss pockets but that has subsided now after a couple doses of antibiotics. Could the teeth being extracted cause this? could the infection have affected my brain. Also I suffer from MS but I have been seeing a nuerologist and everything seems to be ok. I have had 2 MRI s done in the past month and a half. Thanks","Doctor":"Hello & welcome, First & most important thing here is, just go for check up of your newly made Denture. This is so because, denture if over extended on palatal side, causes feeling of nausea thereby leading to dizziness. Although this nausea & dizziness can be due to gastric irritation by the antibiotics taken by you, checking denture for over extension will be primary advise. And if denture is found overextended, then can be treated by grinding & reducing extension of the denture to proper limits by your dentist. Absolutely, oral infection & brain has nothing to do with each others. Tooth extraction can cause pain but not nausea. You should not wear your denture if there is any residual infection in extraction socket which should be treated immediately. You can undergo blood sugar examination as diabetes patients suffer from delayed wound healing & difficulty in wearing denture.

If the bumps are on the top of your tongue, chances are they are the circumvallate papillae which help in taste.  If they are on the sides of your tongue then chances are they are the foliate papillae.  It is highly unlikely to develop oral cancer from one year of use, but does increase you chances of developing it.  I would recommend discontinuing the use of chewing tobacco and use substitutes like xylitol gum.  Your wisdom teeth can contribute to the pain and you should probably be evaluated to have them taken out.  See if the pain stops after discontinuing the usage of the chew. It may take two weeks for the tissue to heal post exposure to the irritant. Best wishes and good health.

A filling is a way to restore a tooth damaged by decay back to its normal function and shape. Dentist first removes the decayed tooth material, cleans the affected area, and then fills the cleaned out cavity with a filling material. There are different filling materials :- Gold filling Amalgam filling Composite filling Porcelain filling No,one type of filling is best for everyone. What's right for you will be determined by the extent of the repair, whether you have allergies to certain materials, where in your mouth the filling is needed, and the cost.

I brush twice a day, floss and also use mouth wash. i ve tried spray products, and always chew gum but regardless my girlfriend can still smell it/taste it. i always suffer from dry mouth regardless but i know that s not the cause. i ve ran out of idea s what to do. Any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for your question. If you have dry mouth this is mostly likely the culprit.  You need to brush your tongue.  A lot of the bacteria that causes bad breath lives on the dorsal (top) surface of your tongue.  You should get a ora tongue brush.  You brush back and forth a few times then scrape the tongue forward removing bacteria.  If you have dry mouth, the bacteria doesn't get flushed of like normal from saliva so it stays on your tongue more and grows. Swish with Listerine for 1 minute, spit do not rinse, let it sit in your mouth for at least a half hour to help knock down the bacterial load in your mouth.  Flossing is also very important for you. For dry mouth try biotene products and see if this helps you breath. Cut back on coffee, tobacco, onions, garlic to improve breath as well.

With the normal wear and tear daily, these papillae are shed off. But sometimes, due to certain conditions, this normal process of shedding of papillae is altered. The papillae then keep growing in size. Food particles get stuck up in these outgrowths. The food debris becomes a breeding ground for many bacteria and fungi, giving rise to a dark, fuzzy look called as the black tongue. Its chief cause is improper oral hygiene.But it can be due to fungal infection also. Its treatment includes maintaining proper oral hygiene by regulare brushing & flossing.Pineapple is also used as a black tongue treatment. In this treatment, small pieces of pineapple are to be sucked for about forty seconds keeping them near the base of the tongue. They are then slowly chewed over a period of eight minutes. This process is to be repeated two times daily for duration of seven to ten days till the time the discoloration fades away.

It is very ill advised to stop your medication treatment on your own without consulting your dentist.  This can cause serious adverse effects.  Chances are the symptoms are due to the tylenol 3 because of the narcotics in combination with not eating enough and drinking enough fluids post surgery.  Increase your fluid intake to 8 8oz glasses of water a day and have a high protein high vitamin diet.  You should consume more calories post surgery to help with the healing.

Your tooth received trauma from the fall, it has killed the nerve and blood supply to the tooth.  The tooth now needs to have a root canal to remove the necrotic tissue from the inside.

Exposure of the underlying bone and nerves results in severe pain.Its chief cause are:- -smoke -have poor oral hygiene -have wisdom teeth pulled -have greater than usual trauma during the tooth extraction surgery -Rinsing and spitting a lot or drinking through a straw after having a tooth extracted also can increase your risk of getting dry socket. Its symptoms are:- -Severe pain within a few days after a tooth extraction -Partial or total loss of the blood clot at the tooth extraction site, which you may notice as an empty- (dry) socket -Visible bone in the socket -Pain that radiates from the socket to your ear, eye, temple or neck on the same side of your face as the extraction -Bad breath or a foul odor coming from your mouth -Unpleasant taste in your mouth -Swollen lymph nodes around your jaw or neck If you experience all these symptoms then better consult your dentist & go for some socket dressings like- zinc oxide eugenol dressing & iodoform dressing.

I have had a burning sensation in my lower abdomen for around 7 weeks now (Also some weakness) all bloods were checked and Thyroid - all fine. I have a history of reflux, around 5 weeks ago I ran out of omeprezole and was taking one zantic tablet per day instead. This is when my symptoms became worse, I experienced black stools and slight constipation and then loose stools alternating. Also started to experience some difficulty swallowing (Not liquid or solids - just general swallowing). At times I had breathlessness and a heavy sensation in my chest,as well as some days where I was so weak I could hardly get out of bed. At this stage I sent in stool samples and had all bloods done again - all fine. My doctor told me to try taking more omeprezole (20mg  twice a day). This was 2 weeks ago and although the chest pain has improved and the bowel movements are better - I still have the mild burning in the lower abdomen, the uncomfortable swallowing and at times a sort of tense neck with a tight feeling on the right side. The worst thing is that I still have periods of awful weakness. I'm beginning to think I'm going mad. I am becoming very panicky and very depressed at times. I was completely fit and healthy before this - it has all been rather sudden, my only ever complaint was acid reflux. I am 42 years old. I have no coughing or blood coming from anywhere. It's the weak ness that scares me the most. I have an OGD next week and am terrified as I think only something like cancer can cause this kind of weakness. Now I'm starting to loose sleep with the worry.Thanks for listeningJulie","Doctor":"Hi Julie.Thanks for your query.Read and understood your history related to the burning pain in lower abdomen as well as the Zantac and Omeprazole consumption.Since all the tests you say are normal in spite of the black stools, something is looking contradictory.I would advise you to undergo OGD and also insist on Colonoscopy and CT scan of the abdomen as there is a chance diagnosis of cancer as you are suspecting. But there is a more chance that there may just be a non-cancerous problemlike an infection or so.Get the investigations done. Take a course of an antibiotic, metronidazole, probiotic.Continue Zantac and Omeprazole too as their role of action are different.

The bad taste you are sensing is bacteria, food debris and exudate.  This infection can become quite painful.  It would be best to have your wisdom teeth taken out.  They are allowing a passage between your mouth to inside your bone putting you at risk for a very painful infection.  Best bet is that your taste would go away with the removal of the teeth.

Will I face any problems or pain infuture after extraction of teeth?","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for your questions. The risks of losing your sight from an extraction of third molars is close to impossible. Most common side effects of third molar extractions are temporary: -Swelling -Bleeding -Pain -Bruising -Stiffness in Jaw Less likely side effects -breaking of parts of jaw requiring the bone to be smoothed with a file....pieces of bone this big:  {     } -numbness or loss of feeling in the lower lip (1% chance with 0.1% being permanent) -infection -alterations in the sense of smell or taste (highly unlikely) -breaking of the roots requiring more invasive surgery (if this occurs you wouldn't even know when they were doing it) -TMD -Death (most often associated with inhaling the extracted tooth into the lungs-we use precautions to prevent this) or allergic or physiological reactions to heavy sedatives used in sedation cases. I have extracted hundreds of wisdom teeth in the past year and only one had numbness from the surgery due to the close approximation of the IAN and they recovered within two weeks time.

Any time you have a red lesion on the side of the tongue that persists longer than a few weeks it is important to have it evaluated in person by a dentist and possibly biopsied.  Oral cancer can occur at any age and is very common on the side of the tongue.  The tried and true method of identification is through biospy.  Many lesions can appear flat, red and on the side of the tongue. Highly unlikely that it is cancer at your age, but safe to rule out if it doesn't go away.

Based on what you have described you have either a perio or a dental abscess.  This is causes either by a severe infection below the gum line associated with the gingiva around the tooth or due to a tooth that has has the nerve die and is now necrotic.  Since the nerve is dead, you don't have any feeling in it and you won't experience pain.  The reason why it doesn't hurt is because the abscess is draining and there isn't a build up of pressure.  You need to go to a dentist to get it evaluated and determine the origin of the infection to have it treated. If you went to a dentist and they have no idea what it is, then I strongly encourage you to find another dentist and get evaluated.  Most dentist know what this is right off the bat.

Have a dentist appointment booked for next Thursday but I m a bit worried... what could it be? she is fit and healthy but possibly doesn t have the best oral hygiene but we re trying.... thanks","Doctor":"hello and welcome, the black/blue mark may be due to dental carries.visit your dentist and get it checked.the carries can be excavated and filled with vitapex-gic or any other tooth coloured material. as the tooth is erupted recently,gums look ugly as the adjacent teeth are yet to erupt,which is known as ugly duckling stage.the gums looks regular and proper tooth alignment occurs only after eruption all anterior teeth. oral hygiene maintenance is very important.poor oral hygiene will result in plaque and food debris accumulation.this results in gingivitis.get the scaling done by your dentist. use soft-bristled toothbrush to clean your teeth twice daily.wash your mouth after every meals . always brush your teeth from up to down in upper arch and down to up in lower arch. use chlorhaxidine containing mouthwash to prevent plaque accumulation. regards DR.BINDIYA"},{"Patient":"I fell asleep earlier today and when I woke up a few hours earlier a part of my gum over my lower wisdom tooth of the left side was swollen and in a lot of pain. Well it was kind of going over the other tooth as well so I pushed it back. When I did that, the swelling went down and nothing but blood came out of it. What could cause.this to happen?","Doctor":"It is pericoronitis. The gum over the wisdom tooth is inflamed. You can start with tinimox tab twice daily for 5 days and Flozen AA tab twice daily after food and Pantaprozole 40mg before food to avoid gastric irritation and can apply dentogel over affected area twice or thrice daily and maintain the area clean and use some luke warm water and salt in it rinse thoroughly. If it is still persisting, it might require small surgery called operculectomy i.e excision of the gums covering the tooth. this is done if the wisdom is properly erupted without troubling the adjacent tissues otherwise wisdom tooth needs to be extracted.

I have no idea what any of this is","Doctor":"hello and welcome, is this the first time you are getting such lesions or how often you get this type of lesions.. according to your description,it can be a case of either benign migratory glossitis or aphthous ulcer. final diagnosis can be made only after seeing biopsy. benign migratory glossitis is a psoriasisform mucositis of dorsum of tongue. its dominant charecteristic is a constantly changing pattern of serpiginous white lines surrounding areas of smooth,depapillated mucosa. the changing appearance has led some to call this the wandering rash of tongue,with the depapillated areas.no treatment is usually necessary for benign migratory glossitis and stomatitis. symptomatic lesions can be treated with topical prednisolone and a topical or systemic antifungal medication.occasional symptomatic cases  respond well to topical tetracycline or systemic,broad-spectrum antibiotics. if this lesion is aphthous ulcer, it can be treated by tab.flanzen and tab.wysalone. regards DR.BINDIYA."},{"Patient":"After a nasty attack 18 months ago, I was left with a broken jaw in 3 places. After two ops it was fixed to the best they can with 5 plates. Since then I ve not been able to open my mouth properly, would say there s a gap of 1.5 cm between teeth when fully open. During the last few wks I m suffering constant pain all down the left side of my face, hurts more when I move head up and down. Any ideas...thanks","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for your question. You need to have your jaw rebroken clinically and realigned correctly.  Your bite is now off and this is affecting how your jaw moves around the jaw joint.  Surgery would be the best option for you and possible orthodontic intervention to help get your teeth to touch correctly. Best wishes to you. Dr. Ward"},{"Patient":"I have had an abscess tooth on the lower side on and off for 6 months, I cannot afford a dentist . he emergency room has given me antibiotics every time, The tooth is no longer sore or hurt but I now have 2 painful lumps on my jaw bone. I live in a rural area and there are no free dental clinics. I am taking antibiotics again but the lumps are still painful and still swollen.","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for your question. The only thing you can do is extract the tooth.  If this has been bothering you for 6 months, you should have been putting money to the side to help cover the cost of the extraction.  Taking antibiotics long term is only placing a bandade on it and not treating the problem.  This can cause the bacteria to become immune to the antibiotics and become more dangerous.  The lumps are either abscesses, inflamed lymph nodes or the combination of the two.  Google free dental clinics near your area, if you have to travel 50 miles, it would be worth it if you cannot afford the treatment.  This can be deadly and should not be left to linger. I speak these words out of concern for your health and hope that you get this taken care of soon.

Your tooth has a large cavity which has infected the nerve, the nerve is inflamed and swollen.  The cold relieves the pain because it causes the pressure to decrease for a minute.  The damage to the nerve is irreversible and the tooth if restorable needs to have the decay removed, a root canal performed and a crown or large restoration placed in the tooth.  Or if the tooth is non-restorable, the tooth needs to be pulled before you get a large infect in your jaw.

So im freaking out, even tho he said dont lose sleep over it!?! Ive smoked since 16, im 30, i smoke up to a pack a day, dont drink a lot! How do i know if its jusr something irritated my gums or its cancerous?","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for your question. Most likely you have a periodontal abscess that needs to be cleaned out through scaling and root planing.  Most common place for oral cancer is floor of the mouth.  Since this was a pus forming area in the gums it was most likely due to an overhang on a restoration, calculus, plaque or food debris, fractured root on tooth and not cancer.  However, I strongly encourage you to quit smoking because you are at hight risk for getting cancer.  Worry about cancer and quit before you get it, not after.  You should rest easy knowing it is highly unlikely cancerous. Best regards Dr. Ward"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am having horrible pain under my jaw line on my left side. I imagine it is a lymph node that is swollen. However, it is not the typical swelling and symptoms that go along with a regular infection. This has happened before, but it comes on very suddenly and feels as though it swells up very fast. The pain feels like it s right under my tongue . In the past, the swelling and pain go away in about 30 seconds to a minute and I never experience any other symptoms. This however, is not going away quickly. It s been like this for about 10 minutes at this point. It is hard to swallow or open my mouth at all.","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for your question.

Based on what you described, I would recommend going in to a dentist to be evaluated and possibly get a biopsy.  The sides of the tongue can have multiple pathologies that are causing these issues.

When I open it as far as I need, say, to put a fork in my mouth to eat, it clicks, just between the edge of my mouth and ear . It sounds a bit like an elastic band breaking. It only started today about halfway done my lunch. When I went to Guidance (I was at school), the lady I talked to said I should tell my mom to get it checked. What exactly is it? I am only 14 years old, turned so on January the 2nd. I have only had cavities once. I got 8 at the same time, but they were all baby teeth and I ve lost them by now. I ve never done anything to my jaw that I know of directly. My last visit to the dentist was in March(this month). I got my teeth cleaned and checked, as well as a flouride treatment. I also am known to grind my teeth at night, and used to have headgear. My orthodontist decided my condition was not too bad so I didn t get braces.","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for your question. In your head you have a groove in the skull and a rounded joint on the jaw, between these two bones that make of the temporal mandibular joint is a cartilage disc.  This disk is attached by muscles and elastic ligaments.  when you open your jaw it rotates then slides down and forward, when this happens the disc slides back.  When you close it goes back forward.  Sometimes these ligaments become loose and there is a lag in the sliding of the disc. A closing click arises during closing of the jaw and is caused by the condyle (the rounded part of your jaw joint) rapidly repositioning posteriorly (towards the back), displacing the disc anteriorly (towards the front) or medially (towards the side).  An opening click arises in the opposite of what was just said. If you get a line of 100 people 40-60 of these people will have clicking, cracking or popping in their jaws without any issues. Hope this helps give you comfort. Best wishes and good health Dr. Ward"},{"Patient":"I have a sore tongue (on the left side) that has been sore for 3 years. There is nothing you can see but it is sore. I think it started after I had been taking Prilosec for about 15 years. Doctors tell me it doesn t have anything to do with it. I have seen my dentist , 2 oral surgeons, ENT, and they just say they can t see anything. It is really annoying. Any ideas?","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for your question. For a sore tongue that has been sore for three years but does not have any physical markings I would suggest that the tongue may not be the source of the pain.  You may be experiencing what is called referred pain.  In other words you feel the pain in your tongue but it may be originating in another part of your body, like an ulcer in your stomach, or a tumor in your jaw (these are just examples not me stating you have these).  Your tongue pain may be caused by glossitis, inflammation in the tongue as well.  Causes of this include vitamin B12 deficiency,  Sjogren's syndrome, and side effects of medications or chemotherapy. Since you are chronically taking prilosec, this may be due to a vitamin B12 deficiency.  According to one study I read when used over a long period of time, such as three years or more, prilosec can cause a vitamin B-12 deficiency. Signs of a B-12 deficiency include a sore tongue, unusual and unexplained weakness and numbness and tingling in the hands and feet. I hope this helps you in your discovery of your problem.  I recommend taking a Multi-B vitamin and see if the issue subsides in a few weeks.

We use retractors to keep your tongue out of the way and to protect your throat from inhaling (aspirating) the tooth.  This is a common trauma seen after third molar extractions.  The bump on the roof of your mouth could be a growth. -Lymphoid aggregates are a common finding in that area treatment is not required and they are benign. They are common findings of the Waldeyer's Ring. -Torus Palantinus:  an outgrowth of bone also benign, although rare to extend that far back -Fordyce Granules are sebbaceous glands (sweat glands in the mouth) and are a nomral finding -Nicotine Stomatitis if you smoke this can also cause the red blotches -Erythroplasia is a malignancy that needs to be taken out These are a few lesions found near the uvula.  Unfortunately, I cannot diagnose you without proper evaluation and biopsy.  But rest assured at your age and location of lesion, it is most likely a benign issue that either needs to be monitored or taken out with a small window of healing. Best wishes and health, I hope this gives you peace of mind. Dr. Ward"},{"Patient":"Hi. Today I had an old filling removed from a lower moler. The tooth also has a small crack in the rear of the tooth. Anyway, the old silver amalgam filling was grinded out. The old filling was very large, as the dentist mentioned to me. So he finished grinding it out. He mentioned seeing the crack. He then put in a temporary filling. It is very white in color. So I scheduled an appointment for 3 weeks from now. But now that the anesthetic has worn off, the tooth is so sensitive to pressure that I cannot make contact between my upper and lower tooth without piercing pain. It doesn t hurt badly at rest. But only when biting or under pressure. Is this normal for a temporary filling? Thanks!","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for your question. This typically is not normal for a temporary filling.  This may indicate that the bite is too high on the restoration and will need to be reduced to help remove the irritation. Depending on the crack, what happens with this is when you bite down you open the crack which changes the pressure around the nerve, when you let go, it closes and changes the pressure again, this leads to pain in the nerve.  This may indicate that the crack has entered into the pulp requiring a root canal or it causes enough irritation to the pulp that the dentist needs to grind the tooth until the crack goes away. I have worked on many patients with cracks in their teeth and the pain goes away once it's drilled out.  Other times it goes right into the pulp and needs to have a root canal.  In other cases the crack is so deep that the tooth is non-restorable and needed to be extracted.  Hang in there. Best Wishes Dr. Ward"},{"Patient":"I had my lower right wisdom tooth extracted Tuesday at 10am. Early Wednesday morning at 4 am I woke up vomiting and did not stop until I received an injection at my family doc s office at 1030 am. I still feel extremely nauseous in waves. Also there s a consistent tightness in my chest. Should I be worried or is this a side effect of the mild constipation I m experiencing due to the codeine?","Doctor":"HELLO AND WELCOME, codeine is an opium alkaloid, its degree of analgesia is comparable to aspirin.it can relieve only mild to moderate pain. constipation is the prominent side effct of this drug when used as an analgesic. it is also used as an antitussive drug and also to control diarrhoea. the nausea ,vomitting and dizziness are the other side effects. so the symptoms you experience are the side effects of the drug used. if the symptoms persist ,visit your dentist and ask him for anti-emetic drug like domperidone and a purgative drug. regards DR.BINDIYA"},{"Patient":"My son has a big bump on gum on top of his front tooth .

Put some dental relief on it. It looks better but it s still big! U think the surgery to take it out is necessary? It s going cost me 2000 with my insurance. That s alot.","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for your questions. The bump you are describing is an abscess.  You need to have your child brought in to a dental clinic to have the infection removed via extraction of the teeth or root canal therapy and possible antibiotic therapy. Are you brushing and flossing your child's teeth?  His oral health today will affect his oral health tomorrow.  You may be putting him to bed with other fluids besides water.  Water should be the only thing that a child goes to bed with.  Anything else will rot their teeth (baby bottle rot). If your dentist is costing you 2000.00 on top of insurance coverage for a tooth extraction, I highly recommend getting a consult by another dentist.  This sounds extremely high. Do not sit on this problem with your child.  Since his condition and age, not seeking immediate attention can be considered child neglect and state services can get involved. Best wishes!

Is it my wisdom teetg or do i have an infectiob hheeelllpppp!","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for your questions. Based on what you are describing it can be a multitude of things: -An inflamed pulp in the tooth with a large filling which is causing the tooth to become necrotic and infected -A third molar which is coming in and causing soft tissue pain -The tooth next to it may have what was stated above The best bet is if you have pain in the tooth that is throbbing and keeping you up at night you have irreversible pulpitis which is an inflammatory response leading to a dying blood supply and pulp in the tooth. You need to go to a dentist for radiographs (x-rays) and a pulp vitality test to determine if it's the tooth causing the pain, which one is causing the pain or if you have a wisdom tooth coming in. These kind of issues are best diagnosed with evaluation.  Dental pain can have a multitude of causes and each one needs to be diagnosed with proper testing by a licensed dentist. Best of luck and good health Dr. Ward"},{"Patient":"My last wisdom tooth is coming in and it almost seems as if it doesn t have enough room. I have pain but its bearable and I can handle it. Not too extreme. But I noticed that when I push on it, it has some puss coming out. I am washing with hydrogen peroxide and also talking ampocilin antiobiotics. I can t afford to get it pulled. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for writing your query. I read your problem,first thing i would like to inform you that wisdom teeth are vestigial and they play very little role in chewing food and if they do not have enough space to come out in the oral cavity then there are chances of recurrent infection known as pericoronitis which will cause pain and swelling again and again and destroy the underlying bone. So i will suggest you please visit an oral surgeon in your area as soon as possible and get the clinical examination done including x-rays and go for extraction of the same if needed. Nothing to get worried,mean while you can use betadine mouthwash twice a day. Take Care. Dr. Gunjan Gupta"},{"Patient":"Hey!

I am worried perhaps my body isn t soaking up the water?","Doctor":"hello and welcome, these are usual symptoms associated with abrasion,erosion and attrition. visit your dentist to get the diagnosis. if it is attrition,there will be physiologic wearing away of a tooth as a result of tooth-to-tooth contact,as in mastication.usually it occurs in elderly patients.in this case ,enamel has been completely worn away,resulting in extrinsic yellow or brown staining of exposed dentin.this usually treated by artificial replacement of teeth. if it is abrasion,there is pathologic wearing away of tooth substance.it usually occurs on exposed root surfaces of teeth and also on incisal or proximal surfaces.improper brushing technique,habitual opening of bobby pins with teeth,habitual pipe smokers,improper use of dental floss and toothpicks are the usual causes of abrasion.it is usually treated by tooth coloured restorations like glass ionomer cement.or by tissue grafting. if it is erosion,it is an irreversible loss of dental hard tissue by a chemical process that doesnot involve bacteria.dissolution of mineralised tooth structure occurs upon contact with acids that are introduced into oral cavity from intrinsic-vomiting,or extrinsic sources-acidic beverages,citrus fruits.in this case,avoid intake of excessive acidic foods or beverages. yours is more chance of erosion case-in case of dry mouth,use sugarless chewing gum or mints to increase residual salivary flow.the  use of oral pilocarpine may also be beneficial. take care."},{"Patient":"My back molar tooth has a yellow/ whiteish circle like with a small dot in it on my gum.

I would advise you to take plenty of water, lime juice and chew sugar free gums. Also get your diabetes checked.

The first and second probability seems to have more chances, as it is not exactly clear from the site that you have mentioned in the case history. In case of salivary duct enlargement it is because of salivary duct stone blocking the path of the saliva secretion, which usually causes pain on times of having food. the second possibilty (more commoner), may be a mucocele, which may be caused by Pinching trauma of Forceps which are used for extractions. lastly engorged vein underneath the tongue are very rarely the cause for such discomfort.

Some times the food also gets lodged in between the flap and the tooth resulting in infection due to degradation of food there leading to pain and bad odor (halitosis). Getting the pus removed again and again may not resolve your problem permanently if the tooth is infected. Ideally you need to get the offending tooth extracted and the pus drained. Your dentist may take an xray of the area to confirm the diagnosis. Meanwhile you can start with antibiotics and anti inflammatory drugs to reduce the infection. You should also do warm saline gargles 3-4 times/day to help in dissolution of the stuck food and removal of pus from the area. Mouthwash rinses twice daily after brushing are also recommended.

Can you suggest any temp. solution to get rid of this pain.","Doctor":"hello and welcome, the pain is due to the incomplete removal of vital pulp within the tooth.the pain aggrevates due to the presence of temporary filling given. if the pain is unmanagable,remove the temporary filling.please visit your dentist at the earliest.ask him to extirpate the pulp in coronal and radicular area completely,. if the pus and blood has to drain out still from the tooth,its better to give open dressing for the tooth.take metrogyl-400mg,thrice daily for 3 days,to reduce the infection and swelling. in the second visit,biomechanical preparation has to be done.in 3rd visit,obturation with gutta-percha cone has to be done followed by crown.obturation should be done only if the tooth is completely healed. hope you get well soon."},{"Patient":"20 year old male with white coated tongue and reoccurring red spots.

Getting all the wisdom teeth removed in a single appointment is someting, that is usually not recommended, since it requires anesthesia, and it is a surgical traumatic procedure.

Biting lips can be due to 2 reasons: -Malpositioning of teeth ie: teeth are out and thus you end up biting your teeth. -Habit If its the first case then i think you must visit an orthodontist (for Braces), so that he can treat the root cause of your problem. If its a habit then its good that you have stopped it on your own. About the white lips, if there is any deposite which is white in colour or patchy discolouration then you may have developed a fungal infection called candidiasis/oral thrush for which you need to put antifungal ointments on the area locally. If the lips have become pale, then you need to visit your physician for a blood test to check your hemoglobin. If the iron content of your body is low (anemia) then that can cause pale lips which needs to be treated. Check for more white patches in your mouth, if present then that may cause bad breath but usually bad breath is because of deposits on the teeth for which a clean up(scaling and polishing) is required. For the above mentioned problems i would recommend you to visit a dentist.

I really got a good oral hygiene and don t have any smoking or drinking habits.","Doctor":"hello and welcome to hcm forum Prettal, i would be glad to answer your query, according to the the dental history provided by you it seems, that the ceramic filling is either too high or there is some infection present in the tooth, pain is usually present following trauma or infection in your teeth, you have not mentioned if there is swelling associated with the pain, i assume there is no swelling. i would like to advise you to visit your dentist again and ask him to check the filling once again ,as it is hurting you. also, the black spot over the gum needs to be checked clinically in order to rule out a diagnosis. till then ,start with warm saline rinses(3-4 times/day),and avoid biting from the affected side. i hope i answered your query, i wish you good health, take care."},{"Patient":"I have a bump on my gum above my front tooth .

I m a 30 year old male. Recently, I started having a tingling (sore-like) pain on the inside ( tongue side) of my lower gum behind my last molar. When I was examining it myself, I noticed that there seems to be a small hole there. When I scratched at it, it almost feels like bone - it s rather hard and rough. There doesn t seem to be any other issues from what I can see. There may be a little bit of white around it, but it s hard to tell. It s not terribly painful, but it has me worried. Are there some possible explanations for this?","Doctor":"hello and welcome to hcm, your teeth is effected by periodontitis which is localised in nature. the tingling pain is due to sensitivity as a result of  gingival recession and pocket formation. white around the tooth is due to deposition of food debris over there which caused the formation of heavy band of plaque called calculus. visit your dentist and get the cleaning and root planning treatments. use desensitising pastes like sensodent to brush your teeth.use soft-bristled toothbrush to clean your teeth. take care."},{"Patient":"I am a twenty-one year old female, smoker about 1-1.5 packs a day, do not consume alcohol. I do have Hashimotos Disease, and some dental issues such as abscess in the past. I developed a dark red circular patch on the roof of my mouth through the course of a week and after gargling salt water and possible trauma by touching it with my tongue , it has increased in size to slightly smaller than a dime. I am petrified that it may be oral cancer , as my dentist said he wants to refer me to an Oral Surgeon. There is no white present on the spot, and the dentist commented that the tissue (bone) on the roof of my mouth feels slightly softer. Does this signify cancer?","Doctor":"madam, as per of your given history, there are very little (almost negligible) chances of this redness to be oral cancer. this redness may be attributted to heat and tobaccoo effects of smoking which may be at maximum a erythroplakia patch, it has nothing to do with Hashimotos' disease. Erythroplakia is a reversible pre-cancerous condition, caused due to tobaccoo, having limited potential of turning into cancer, hat also, if it persists for more than 3 weeks period, increses in size or presents with numbness of that area. First of all you must quit or at least minimize smoking, second you maintain a good oral hygeine, and keep a watch for another 3/4 weeks related to all above sign. lastly, you can see an oral surgeon who can do simple test like exfoliative cytology or biopsy to verify above findings. at such an young age, it is very rare to get Oral cancer. this red patch will definitely fade away within few weeks, IF YOU QUIT SMOKING"},{"Patient":"I have a decaying tooth on my right side its been that way for a year but getting worse.

And last year the upper one was removed. Eventually I was hoping to get the other upper removed. But apparently I now need all four ( dentist suggested) out due to decay despite brushing, flossing, and rinsing. What preparations should I be taking when it comes to removing wisdom teeth on the lower jaw? And based on blood type , what cautions are there?","Doctor":"Hi, Ideally if your dentist has advised you for the extractions of wisdom teeth, then its better to get them removed soon specially if they have cavities. You need to eat before extraction if it will be done under local anesthesia so that you dont feel uncomfortable or weak after the extraction as you will not be able to eat after it for a couple of hours. So to keep your strength up have healthy food before visiting your dentist. Also use cold compress from outside in the area of extraction to reduce/avoid swelling. After the extraction, when your dentist recommends, you should have cold food like ice creams and cold milk etc. After 24 hrs of extraction you should do warm saline gargles 3-4 times / day as it will help in healing.

Was dx with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome despite the condition not being dependent upon positioning. Sent to university cardiologist who said not POTS but rather inappropriate sinus tachycardia . Started and tried on various beta blockers. These symptoms progressed to knee weakness, crawling sensation on thighs, and tremor in arms....three weeks later i woke up saw the room tilt onto its side, bright flashes of light and paralyzed (still breathing) (5 months ago) unable to move an inch of my body, lay there not knowing what to do. Then my entire body spasmed and locked up (my right foot was frozen in position of big toe up, little toes down, ankle inverted for 3 weeks), leg shook, left arm down to hand shook uncontrollably...unable to move my body, feed myself, do anything for three weeks, my entire body became atrophied and had been to three hospitals, a skilled nursing facility twice, am now at an intensive rehab where I am recieving OT, PT, speech therapy, recreation therapy and neuropsych therapy. MRI, EEG, CT scans negative...neurologists have refused to do a lumbar puncture or mRA on me (history of aneurysm runs maternally) drs have stopped looking for the cause - despite the blurred vision, waves, 3D-like vision, cloudiness, grayness...etc 3 months ago, I woke up unable to speak. 2 weeks ago I woke up unable to see correctly. Severe, agonizing pain behind my left eye travels down left side of face, numbs nose, pain in ear, down into neck and shoulder, sometimes left eye gets stuck closed during spasm, but when open everything is too bright and distorted. Right eye things are dimmer, cant make out details, only see shapes and shadows. When eyes are open together unable to focus and experiencing double vision. (past history 2 bouts of lyme disease as a child, treated oral antibiotics, dx fibromyalgia and neurally mediated hypotension at 16 yrs old. All symptoms went into remission during pregnancy four years ago and returned shortly after all the hormones left my body. ) I am desperate for answers or even a hypothesis at this point. i ve been labeled a medical mystery by every doctor, specialist, and medical professional i have met (cardiologists, ENT, neurologists, family doctors, retinal specialist, opthalmalogist). When I have these seizure like episodes, i lose time, am unable to remember at least a days time. The vision is what is scaring me the most right now. I am regaining strength throughout my body, but the pain, and the disturbed vision has me very worried. I am unsure why no doctor will not do a full work-up on me. i had half EMG done to test my nerves and muscles which were normal. I ve had cort-stim test, tilt table, haltermonitor, event monitor, lab work upon lab work, evoked EEG, then 6 hrs worth of 24 hr EEG when the machine broke, CT scan - but no other neuro diagnostic tests. Last MRI was 5 months ago. i keep thinking the front tooth root canal might have something to do with it, but looking at the lyme history I wonder about that too....please help me!","Doctor":"Are you currently on any anti epileptic medication? What were the results of your EEG? What you are describing seems to be neurogenic. The pain and the palsy symptoms are on the left and the root canal was done on your right tooth. It seems that you may be suffering from a severe as yet undiagnosed epilepsy or other neurologic condition. Sometimes tumors or para-neo plastic syndrome can also induce such myriad symptoms. As far as the tooth being the trigger, it seems unlikely however cannot totally be ruled out. As a hypothesis Perhaps the infection on the tooth triggered demylenation of the nerves some what like what occurs to patients suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia"},{"Patient":"I believe I was bitten on my lip 3 weeks ago it itched at first then it swoll up then it began t drain ( puss like ) I squeezed it forcing the puss out then put peroxide then alcohol ..

Regards Jitesh GSM : +0000","Doctor":"dear jitesh genetics is one of the factors for cavity and pyorrhea, however it is not the only factor, that means only genetic factor may not cause full blown disease. for example in an given individual who has genetic predisposition to develop pyorrhea (gum disease) , presence of dental plaque triggers the disease process and due to genetic predisposition the disease progresses faster and there may be more complications, however if the plaque is removed regularly and is not allowed to accumulate then disease progress can be prevented or slowed down. same example holds good for cavity too. people with genetic predisposition should be extra vigilant and take necessary precautions so that disease does not become very severe. regarding bad smell from mouth, there are various causes for it including pyorrhea. please follow this link  do visit a dentist and get examined thoroughly and get the treatment done accordingly. hope your doubts are clarified take care Dr.Avinash"},{"Patient":"I just got my tooth extracted 3 days ago.

I am 14 and very worried about the lump and getting the tooth refilled as I have a fear of the dentist. Any help as to what this is would be very appreciated. Thank you","Doctor":"Dear Millie It looks like you are having periapical abscess. this happens when the decay has become deep and reached the pulp and progressed to tip of the root. the pus is now probably draining out through the sinus which you have described as lump. since the X-ray has been taken, it would clearly show how deep has the decay reached and whether that is the cause for for your lump. in your case most likely root canal treatment is required. the second possibility is that the tooth is decayed beneath the filling and the tooth has chipped off leading to food and plaque accumulation, which might have caused gingival abscess (abscess of gums ) . in which case re doing of filling is sufficient provided the decay has not reached the pulp (X-ray will confirm this). in either case you need not have to be scared, dentist will anesthetise the tooth during the procedure (if he doesn't then insist on it). visit dentist regularly and get yourself examined to prevent future problems. take care regards Dr.Avinash"},{"Patient":"Hi!

It is very common to have swelling after extraction and sometimes after root canal treatment. The swelling will gradually reduce. The dimple is not visible because of swelling,(there would be fluid filled within the spaces in cheek which would have obscured the dimple). As and when the swelling reduces you would see your dimple re appearing. If it was a simple extraction the chances of nerve damage is very less. In your case it is most likely because of swelling the dimple has obscured, which will reappear once the swelling reduces.

I was on my left side sleeping. I also realized that I must do this a lot as I wake up with swelling in my cheek often. I tried different positions and it doesn t make too much of a difference. I found that when I relax, my jaw drops and when I start to wake, either my tongue or my cheek is in the way and I start chewing on them. Is there a safe way to keep my jaw from dropping at night when I sleep?","Doctor":"Hi, Chewing or grinding the teeth at night is a common dental problem called bruxism or night grindiing. it happens specially when a person is sleeping and is not aware of it. Usually the patient either wakes up because of the sound made by grinding or as you mentioned because of biting hard on cheeks. This problem can be solved with the help of a mouth gaurd or dental splint which is to be worn at night while sleeping. I recommend you to visit a dentist for the same.

In general, severe lower abdominal pain can be due to chronic Amoebiasis; diarrhoea need not be there. Motion examination will confirm the diagnosis. Anti-amoebic treatment is needed."},{"Patient":"I was having bad breath, so i went to a medical shop and asked for the tablet, but he gave me some mouth wash. He asked me to gargle with that. I used for 2 times. From that time iam getting irritation, burning in my mouth. Can any body help me with this?","Doctor":"Hi Debashish, There are several reasons for bad breath, most commonly it is tartar in the mouth. You need to get scaling done to remove the dirt and it should improve your breath. Most of the mouth washes contain alcohol / chlorhexidine as an ingredient which results in burning sensation in the mouth. if you already had mouth ulcers then it would have caused severe burning and irritation. I would advice you to stop using that mouthwash and revert to non alcoholic mouthwashes such as betadine mouthwash. This will stop the burning and you will feel comfortable. If the irritation persists after a couple of days then i would strongly recommend you to visit a dentist for the same. Regards"},{"Patient":"Is it possible to correct inclined teeth without braces ?","Doctor":"Hi, Ideally braces are the treatment of choice for correcting teeth positions, but newer types of treatment have also been in the market for a while called invisalign. These are trays which are used to correct positioning of teeth but they just like braces are a long term treatment modality which needs to be constantly checked by a dentist. further more not every case is a good case for invisalign, which your dentist will decide for you. Apart from long term orthodontic treatment such as braces and invisalign, other options are treatments which can be done in a couple of days, such as laminates and crowns to reposition the teeth or close gaps. The drawback for them is that healthy teeth are cut for the placement of the restorations. Patients who do not want such long treatments such as braces can surely look in this direction. I would recommend you to further discuss your options with your dentist. Regards"},{"Patient":"My daughter s baby tooth was struck when she was 2 and it darkened ever so slightly. Her pediatric dentist said not to worry about it, and it might fall out prematurely. Our pediatric dentist is no longer practicing, and our new dentist wanted to extract the tooth. She has since developed a small painless lump above the tooth - not complaining of any soreness or other signs of infection, like a fever. What do you suggest - could we try antibiotics in case there is infection, or does the tooth have to come out?","Doctor":"Hi cory, You haven't mentioned the age of the child. Milk tooth will fall eventually but if it retains for a longer time it creates problem in the eruption of permanent tooth of that region. The small painless lump may be the gingival overgrowth or pulp polyp. The best thing you can do is take opinion of one more dentist and go for extraction of that tooth or the required procedure as suggested by your dentist. Your dentist might suggest you for the dental radiography of the tooth also which helps  a lot in the diagnosis of the problem. Don't ignore the problem as it may get infected and become worse. Antibiotics and other medication will be prescribed by your dentist depending on the condition. Hope this will be helpful.

Anyway, my cheeks feel tight, if I move my jaw, smile, or laugh too much, I start feeling pressure. Also, my ears feel clogged. My mom tells me not to think about it but how can I ignore an uncomfortable feeling? It s honestly driving me insane that I don t know what it is. Can it be from my infected molar? It doesn t hurt anymore, and I haven t got it treated in almost a year. Then again, maybe I might be stressed? Please help me. I ve been feeling this for almost a month. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi, Anxiety and stress are major factors in bruxism ie: unintentional clenching of teeth. infected tooth can cause pain or even discomfort in the jaw but the tightness in your cheek and pressure in your jaw and ears maybe due to the stressful, repeated clenching of teeth. this problem can be solved by wearing a dental appliance called mouth gaurrd or night gaurd.

Bad breath also supports this theory. Stomach upsets result in oral ulcers and as she was also suffering from fever,which maybe due to the oral infection, i would strongly recommend you to visit your dentist as well as physician. Once the teeth are clean and all the germs are eradicated she will be able to eat better and the bleeding along with swelling from gums will get eliminated. The doctor may start some low dose antibiotic for her if required.

My dentist looked at it and said he didn t know what it was but he ruled out cancer, absessed tooth and a blocked duct. I do not have insurance and can not afford a dental surgeon. What is this and is it dangerous. Thank you, Dan","Doctor":"Hi Dan, Sometimes if while eating something sharp gets lodged in gums or palate hurting/injuring that area it causes blanching of the tissues resulting in a white bump. The area you have mentioned already has a small bump anatomicaly called incisive papilla from where nerves and vessels pass.so an injury may have drawn your attention to it. this condition is reversible and is not dangerous at all. As your dentist has ruled out cancer, abcess and a blocked duct then you should just wait and watch the area for any changes. If you do smoke then please stop till you are sure that the area has reverted to normal. If any changes occur i strongly recommend you to re visit your dentist.

As you have been taking pain killers for this problem the problem has reached a chronic stage when even those do not help. If your tooth starts aching on its own and specially if you get up at night due to sudden tooth pain then these are the symptoms for infected tooth. it can be treated by root canal treatment which your dentist will confirm after taking your xrays. For emergency relief of pain, you can put clove in your mouth on the tooth which is hurting as it will give you temporary but instant relief.

You need to do the regular warm saline gargles 3-4times/day for a couple of days so that the tissue is healthy again.

Warm saline gargles will help to a certain extent to drain out the pus from the area but you definitely need a stronger doze of antibiotics under your dentists supervision. The infection can be eliminated and there is no need to worry so much. The yellow white line you have mentioned in your cheeks both sides may be a bite line which is at the junction where upper and lower teeth meet and is completely normal.

Everyone has had a foot or an arm fall asleep at one time or another. I mostly understand the physiology of this dynamic. However, I swear that this has happened to my dentition twice in the last few weeks. On both occasions, it has happened before I fell asleep while I was listening to music in bed while waiting to dose off. I have ruled out bruxism and occlusal trauma. My jawbone was in a relaxed position, slightly open, with my tongue buffering both the mandibular and maxillary dentition. After being focused on the music for 15-30 minutes, I noticed a slight numbness or softness in my teeth (especially the molars and premolars) in all four quandrants. When I gently closed my teeth, jaw I noticed a diminished tactile sensation. It was a milder sensation that a foot falling asleep. There was no accompanying stinging sensation. Also, there was no mobility of any teeth. I finally regained normal feeling, sensation within about 10-15 minutes. I have no known health issues. I am somewhat overweight (190 lbs./5ft.8in.) with normal blood glucose levels. 38-year-old caucasian male.","Doctor":"Hi, Sometimes there is numbness of teeth if the teeth have been abraded due to bruxism or acidity leading to dissolution of enamel from the tooth and mild chronic irritation to dentinal tubules and nerves. Please notice if you gym more, with heavy weights leading to clenching or are stressed as they are the factors leading to the same. I know you have ruled out bruxism but many a times it is night bruxism which you may not notice while sleeping and as is involuntary you may not even notice during daily activities such as driving, cooking , picking heavy weights etc. I would recommend you to visit a dentist to rule it out and to see clinically if anything else is the cause.

I am wondering if this is normal or should I be worried and if he swallows any will it hurt him? He is on clindamycin antibiotic ..","Doctor":"Dear tinawilliams with the details provided by you, I understand the abscess has spread from tooth to bone and fascial space. it is common in such conditions for the pus to drain through sites other than mouth/oral cavity.  it may drain through cheeks or neck sometimes. since he is already on antibiotics you need not worry. no harm if he swallows it. however once the infection is under control, get appropriate treatment (extraction/root canal treatment) done immediately so that source of infection is removed. the color of abscess may not be always yellow. in this case most likely explanation for milky brown pus may be the pus is draining along with blood. take care Dr.Avinash"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am a 30 year old female. had a wisdom tooth removed 5 days ago in a hospital. been experiencing a lot of pain while swallowing . seen a doctor, there isno infection and so been told to use painkillers. i have been on a maximum dose of paracetamol, ibuprofen and codeine since then. pain eased of a bit, however i have been in an absolute agony every time i need to swallow food, even water. therefore have not eaten much in 5 days, lost some weight. what is it and what could help?","Doctor":"Hi, I am Dr. Supriya. i am a dentist.Yes,after removal of wisdom tooth,you will've a lot  of pain ,because of surgical removal of that tooth.You have a big wound in that region.It will take time for healing.but  you don't worry.

Abnormal position of the wisdom tooth and the gum covering it can cause sever pain. assuming it is the wisdom tooth, it is not unusual or rare so you should not worry too much.

Also, I sleep on the sofa a lot and feel my neck is out of place. One time my head was numb and Dr. thought I could be having a stroke so sent me for test. Someone suggested a chiropractor. And he did an adjustment and it went away. I read where this could be caused by nerve damage? Anyway I am scheduled to see an oral surgeon. Dentist did not think it was oral cancer but he is sending me for second opinion. What should I do? Where do I go for help with this. My diet is awful. I do have old fillings and I have seven screws in my jaw for jaw surgery. I am alergic to shellfish and I was diagnosed with thyroid when I was ten with a goiter . Not on meds I took myself off of synthroid when I was 18. Have had test and things are normal. I have a fear of dental work and the cost is too high so have not been to a dentist in 4 years cannot believe it. How time flies. I would appreciate you input of what to do. Thank you!!!","Doctor":"hi, the symptoms you have stated many a times are caused by a peculiar but not uncommon problem called the geographic tongue. it is called so because the lesions as u have stated look like areas which keep shifting. it is also called burning tongue syndrome as thats how the tongue feels. there are lot of theories as to its cause, in which stress and bad diet and spices are at the top, but there is no definite reason for it. some medicines can also cause it so please check if you have changed or are taking any new medicines. This problem has only palliative treatment such as: multi vitamin tablets avoid spicy food maintain good oral hygiene try to reduce stress, anxiety or depression and get proper sleep hours and eating habits if possible having more water and ice may reduce your discomfort Regards"},{"Patient":"hello, my right side of my jaw is in so much pain just started yesterday, when i open my mouth i can not open it all the way, i can turn my head, i can swallow jus hurts a little and when i touch the spot where the pain is located it hurts extremely bad, the whole upper right of my neck is swollen compared to the left side?","Doctor":"hi. You have not mentioned the area of the spot but after hearing your symptoms i am quite certain that the problem is related to your wisdom tooth which is either errupting or else is tilted in the wrong direction. it happens as food gets lodged in that area and its difficult to access it with a brush resulting in infection. this infection in turn causes discomfort in the surrounding gums and also results in mild swelling in the area. warm saline gargles may help and i would recommend you to visit your dentist who can give medication as well as can clinically see the problem. regards"},{"Patient":"Hello, I m an orthodontist . A patient came yesterday to my office refering systemic erythematous lupus (2 years). She is under treatment (lupus) and needs orthodontic treatment and probably will need extraction of 4 premolars to accomplish treatment goals. Are there contraindications? I ve read that Orthodontic braces might make oral ulcers more common. Could you help me?","Doctor":"Hi. Extraction can be done in Systemic Lupus erythemetosus (not systemic erythematous lupus), especially those who are maintaining well under treatment. It should be done in an hospital environment with an infective endocarditis prophylaxis, and increased dose of her morning steroid for that day( consult her doctor). Mentally prepare for bleeding management, if occurs. Orthodontic braces with brackets  can be done, provided patient strictly maintains oral hygiene."},{"Patient":"Hi, My daughter has been to the dentist and is having problem with her upper left gum. Supposedly she has an absess. She has done 3 rounds of antibiotics . it has not taken out the selling puffy jelly bean size lump. She had gone to the dentist again to have it drained. They said it had gone hard and would only bleed . Now it has gotten bigger She had gone to have it pulled but the tapped on the tooth , no pain. They didn t pull it and now has to see an oral surgeon. The e-ray only shows what a previous dentist had done by drilling to deep and messin up the nerve. She will see the surgeon tomorrow. (she has been dealing with this for about 3 or so weeks now) What should she be doing now?? And any ideas what this could be??","Doctor":"hello and welcome to hcm forum, i would like to inform you that your daughter has been suffering from the tooth problem for quite a while now and it has become chronic, and as you said the swelling has become hard, i would recommend its better to visit an oral surgeon as the tooth might go for extraction. swelling is getting bigger because , infection has spread to the sorrounding tissue, therefore do not delay the appointment with dentist. Also ,do not apply warm compresses over the area, ask your daughter to use an antibacterial mouth rinse(3-4times/day). i wish her good health."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:j},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(a=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return a.Patient.toLowerCase().includes(e)||a.Doctor.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},q={class:"search-container"},R={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],O={key:0},E={key:1};function W(a,e,h,c,n,s){const m=g("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔 AI effective tips collection 🧠")])],-1)),t("div",q,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),f(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[p,n.searchQuery]])]),t("div",R,[(o(!0),i(w,null,b(s.filteredPoems,(r,y)=>(o(),v(m,{key:y,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:n.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...r)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...r))},[n.isLoading?(o(),i("span",E,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",O,"See more"))],8,C)):k("",!0)])}const N=u(M,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-2ab8529c"]]),B=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"deepseek/48.md","filePath":"deepseek/48.md"}'),Y={name:"deepseek/48.md"},z=Object.assign(Y,{setup(a){return(e,h)=>(o(),i("div",null,[I(N)]))}});export{B as __pageData,z as default};
