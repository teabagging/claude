Should I go in to the doctor, or just continue to wait?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks  for  your query.Although it isn't possible to diagnose your condition without an examination and a few tests, your history is suggestive of osteoarthritis both knees. Often called wear-and-tear arthritis, osteoarthritis occurs when the protective cartilage on the ends of your bones wears down over time. Osteoarthritis treatments can slow the progression of the disease, relieve pain and improve joint function.I would suggest getting this evaluated by an orthopedician for detailed examination. You may get the X-ray/MRI, some blood tests and joint fluid analysis under his/her guidance to reach the accurate diagnosis.The following measures will help with the painDo regular Exercise. Exercise can increase your endurance and strengthen the muscles around your joint, making your joint more stable. Stick to gentle exercises, such as walking, biking or swimming. Lose weight if you are obese- Being overweight or obese increases the stress on your weight-bearing joints, such as your knees and your hips. Even a small amount of weight loss can relieve some pressure and reduce your pain.Use heat and cold to manage pain. Both heat and cold can relieve pain in your joint.

This needs to be investigated  with  EMG NCV of both lower limbs to confirm diagnosis.  If EMG NCV report is showing  peripheral neuropathy  diagnosis is confirmed. Next step is to search for the cause of neuropathy which may be 1. Diabetes Mellitus 2.  Vitamin B12 and riboflavin deficiency 3. Alcoholism 4. Lead poisoning. You should better consult neurophysician nearby you and get yourself  examined and investigated thoroughly. If exact cause is fond and treated completely  you should get long term relief. Till then continue  treatment as advised.  All the best."},{"Patient":"I am having a lot of pain in literally every joint, and my feet and hands feel slightly swollen.

Been doing a lot of pain management.","Doctor":"Dear patient  Are you having pain in all joints of the body or hand and feet joints ? If pain is in all joints of body it may be due to  vitamin d deficiency or  rheumatoid  arthritis.  If  pain is more in  hand and feet joints possibility  of  rheumatoid  arthritis is more likely. This needs to be investigated  with  1. Xray of both hands and feet 2. Vitamin d levels 3. Serum RA factor.  Visit reputed  laboratory  nearby you and get it done.

You need to consult expert rheumatologist  with Xray report.

Your chest pain is on right side so can not be related with Heart issue but can be with lungs. You have told there is pain even while breathing in also. For this I suggest take one x ray of chest and check every thing is well over there or not. If there is no issue in x ray then I suggest to do some hot water bag fomentation over painful area.Now next is pain in back for this I suggest visit a ortho or physio and let them evaluate. Here with few of physical test they will try to find out whether its muscular soft tissue pain or issue with disc level. They may ask to go for MRI or x ray for detail evaluation. But if there is nothing looks major then will give you primary treatment suggestion with physiitherapy treatment along with back exercise program to strengthen your back as well will also suggest to use hot pack at painful back soft tissue to relax it and have some more pain relief. If there is any thing related to your drinking habit then you will also have symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea, as well stomach pain too. If there is no symptoms like this then nothing related to liver issue. But still I suggest to reduce drinking as much as you can.I am sure this will be helpful if you follow it.

I seem to stretch all night but the ache is still there and to step into a pair of shoes after getting out of bed is horrible. Doesn t matter if i wear tennis shoes, heels or flats. What could this be?","Doctor":"Your issue is pain in ankle and feet especially after you be in one position and then when you start walking or stand, it aches a lot. Here as per your symptoms there are couple of possibilities. It can be due to calcium and vitamin D deficiency. And because of this your feet bones are weak and so that when ever you do weight bearing on legs, due to weak bones it starts paining you.It can also be due to ankle sprain along with plantar facitis (inflammation in plantar facia ).It can also be due to ankle twist along with hairline fracture if it has happen with you.How ever it is not possible to rule out any thing with out examination. So I suggest to visit a ortho doctor and let him do a x ray as well required test and based on that here doctor will guide you for further treatment.If every thing is fine with bones and its problem related to ankle sprain along with plantar facitis then physiotherapy treatment along with deeping ankle and feet in hot water at home will Also be helpful.I suggest use only flat and soft foot wear.

First is left leg imbalance and not able to give weight in it. Second is high blood sugar.For sugar patient it is common when ever there is some thing wring in body along with inflammation the first thing is sugar level goes up. But it can also be normally with out any cause so first thing you need to do is maintain his diet and blood sugar level through insulin or which ever way possible. If needed do visit your diabetologist for further treatment.Next you have mention he is not able to balance or give weight on one of his leg. But you have not mention what exactly happens when he gives weight on leg. Is it due to pain or loss of control. Let's assume if its pain.Now pain in leg can be due to some injury where he might have hit his leg some were and he Don't remember or it can be due to reduce blood circulation also. Here I suggest patient need to visit a orthopedic doctor and go ahead with proper examination and evaluation and plan treatment as per that.If there is too much pain at leg then patient can use hot pack as well apply a crep bandage to stabilise the soft tissue. This will help for getting some pain relief but remember this will not cure the pain. So do visit doctor as early as possible. If its loss of control then also you need to evaluate it properly why its happening. It may be possible due to age also. But further evaluation as well conformation can be done only on examination so I suggest to check with doctor again for this.I am sure this will be useful for you if you follow the given advice properly.

Several months ago when I woke up I felt like I had a hitch on my right hip side but it would go away throughout the day. For the last month when I wake up or sit for a long time I have horrible pain and it feels like the back of my legs and buttocks muscles are seizing when I walk or reach for things above my head and also when I bend over. The pain usually gets better throughout the day but is still always there. Also, for quite some time my hands fall asleep when I sleep. If I lay on my left side my right hand falls alseep and if I lay on my right side my left hand falls asleep. It takes awhile after I get up for that feeling to go away. Any suggestions? Thanks, JH","Doctor":"Here you have given symptoms of pain in buttock as well as both the legs and it gets worse if you sleep on either side for that side. Apart from this you have also given symptoms of hands becoming numb when ever you sleep to one side the opposite side hand becomes numb.As per your symptoms it looks like you have issues with your back lumbar spine and due to this you have pain in buttock as well as in your legs. I suggest you need to do a MRI of lumbar spine and check further with orthopedic doctor followed by physiotherapist.Apart from this the numbness in hands indicates there may be problem with cervical spine as well deficiency of vitamine B , vitamine D as well calcium. How ever the conformation can be done by blood test. And physical examination by orthopedic doctor.Here for your pain at buttock and leg level as per the evaluation done by your doctor if there is no major issue then physiotherapy treatment and exercises will help you a lot.

I walked in a rounded corner of a dense Woden table yesterday. I have a green and purple bruise on my outer quad, just above my left knee. It is throbbing. The throbbing has become more intense over the past 24 hours. I can t lie or walk without deep, throbbing pain. Why?","Doctor":"Just because of normal walking in round wooden table it can not start paining in knee joint.Here you need to clear one thing wether you was walking on your knee or was walking normally on your feet. If it was walking on your knee then it can start paining you due to strain on soft tissue as well as knee joint.I suggest use cold pack and apply some pain relieving ointment for time being for one or two days. Later or in between if you are comfortable and feels good start using hot pack for heat fomentation at painful soft tissue. Most important thing if its paining then do not do much of walking and folding knee activities. Take some rest. It should be all right on its own with body's natural healing capacity.But if it is not becoming well then you need to visit orthopedic doctor as well physiotherapist for proper examination and treatment. You may need to take one x ray of knee joint as well to check no further damage at knee level. I suggest go ahead with proper treatment with orthopedic doctor as per evaluation and if needed take physiotherapy treatment too. Physiotherapy treatment will also help you to reduce soft tissue strain by increasing healing in soft tissue as well it will also help for pain relief.I am sure this will be useful if you follow the advice properly.

When I was born my hip stuck out and grew that way during my mother s pregnancy. I was born with one hip (the entire side) completely sticking forward but was fine. The doctors decided to break my hip and put it in place. They told my mother to just use extra diapers and watch me extra. Did extra tests all that as a baby. I have always had problems and just thought I was broken I did not know about being born wrong and having that happen until I was older. now I have other problems stemming in the spot where my spine is twisted as a result. I have osteoarthritis in that spot and degenerative disc disease. My doctor said that essentially stretching me out will fix this. I have had it my entire life and am tired of being in pain and walking with a limp. Is this the right diagnosis (the congenital hip dysplasia)? What can I do to help my pain? I have alot of health care professionals look at me odd because i m 26 with these issues. I have problems walking and can t run more than a short sprint without pain or stand in one spot longer than a few minutes without my legs locking up. It s becoming more of a problem and I have 4 children to think about. I refuse to be that laid up mom. I have also with my youngest had a dural puncture through my spine 2ce (brilliant people there) which caused many problems by itself. 2 years ago I couldn t even hold a pen. The degenerative disc disease and osteoarthritis were discovered after avoiding car on my bicycle on the way to work and falling via the e.r. about a month ago. Thanks! Sorry it s long.","Doctor":"Dear patient,usually congenital hip dysplasia, is painless, but with limp on walking. its true that this lurch while walking affects the spine causing it to tilt, and getting degenerated early.In your case an X Ray can be diagnostic, and at your age you can think of getting a hip replacement done, so get it done if quality of your life is at sake, the worst thing that can happen with a replacement is that you may need revision surgery in the future, but that is the price we pay for getting good quality of life, and it also will help your spine.I hope that makes your decision clearThanks"},{"Patient":"My husband fell last night and does not remember what happened to him.

What could possibly be wrong with it. and what can i do to relieve it?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for contacting HCM. In cases like yours with an ankle sprain and then continued pain, it is most likely that there was some soft tissue damage on the structures that support the ankle joint itself. There is a ligament and two tendons on the outside of the ankle that are the main stabilizers, and these structures can get stretched, partially torn, or completely torn with a sprain. Most times, these will scar back down and continue to support the ankle. Other times, they will not be able to do the job as they did before and will have to work \\"overtime\\" to do the same job. This area then gets inflamed and painful, especially after a full day of trying to stabilize the joint (being on the feet all day). It is wise to start out with an ankle brace and see if that helps the area, as the brace can do the job of these soft tissue structures and give them a break to help decrease inflammation/pain.I hope this answer helped, if you have any further questions, I am here to help.Thank you."},{"Patient":"hi I am a 44yr old female, I weigh 250ilbs and am 5 3 in height.

What may be cause of swelling and should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for contacting HCM. In cases like yours, most likely the cause is some deficiency in the veins of the lower legs. If the veins are not able to pump the blood back up towards the heart as before, backlog and subsequently, swelling can occur. This tends to be worse with the feet down, as gravity adds even more work for the veins. This is very common in people, and usually the course of action is some type of compression stocking (if the blood bringing the blood down to the legs, arteries, are working properly).I hope this helped answer your question, if you have any others I am here to help.Thank you."},{"Patient":"My thumb will not bend.

There are a couple of options available in a case like yours for continued treatment. One would be to get a repeat xray to visualize if they avulsion fragment has displaced further, or has entered into the ankle joint itself.

The description you are giving is the normal course of a bruise before disappearing.

With any TAR and possible infection, it is recommended to have a physician evaluation to prevent any larger situations. Usually with sores, a culture can be taken to determine the correct antibiotic to treat the area. With drainage and purulence, this can definitely indicate an infection of some kind. It is usually recommeded to take care of any infections in close proximity to a TAR first, then proceed to other treatments.I hope this helps answer your question.

Swelling in the legs and feet can come from many causes, one of them being general circulation or ineffectiveness of the kidneys to rid the body of excess water. Most times, people with lower extremity swelling will be placed on diuretics (\\"water pills\\") to see if that helps reduce the swelling. If the veins are not working as properly as they were, there may be a need for compression stockings, assuming the arteries are normal. It would be good to get the situation evaluated being that there are so many different causes.I hope this answers your question, if you have any further questions, I am here to help.Thanks."},{"Patient":"My dad is 60 yrs old and undergoing treatment for symptoms of TB. sometimes he do get pink swollen toe.

Pain and swelling of a toe that responds to antibiotics would indicate some sort of bacterial infection at that area. If this is the case, there would be no way to treat it without some type of medicine.

It sounds like you have some muscular soreness after the fall. This is similar to having a whiplash type injury. If you are experiencing stiffness then apply some heat and perform some gentle stretching. Massage and physical therapy can also help. If you have a lot of pain then take an over the counter medicine like Tylenol or ibuprofen.  Best wishes. I hope this helps.

I will try to answer your question to the best of my ability. Your questions stays twisted ankle, but in the text refers to your knee. I suspect you are worried about a knee problem.  When the knee is swollen after an injury it is always a good idea to make sure that you haven't damaged a meniscus or ligament in the knee.  If the knee feels stiff  I would apply some simple heat and take something like a Tylenol if it is painful.  If it is not improving in the next few days  I would suggest seeing either your primary care physician or an orthopaedic specialist.I hope this information is useful for you.

I first noticed it about 2 weeks ago when I would lay down after being on my feet all day. A few days ago I noticed that it started hurting just walking around a little bit. Last night in particular it was bothering me. It seemed to be right at the joint of my right hip. I was thinking it could possibly be either a labral issue or a flexor strain, that s where the pain is located. Both internal and external hip rotation seem to make the pain a little worse, as well as applying pressure with the weight of my leg against a solid surface. I would rather not visit a doctor if it is unnecessary, but I was hoping to get an opinion on if I should or what that may even sound like.","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for contacting me at \\"Ask a Doctor\\". I will try to answer your question to the best of my ability. there are several causes for hip pain.  I do not know how old you are but certainly the possibility of some arthritis in the hip needs to be ruled out.  The way to do this would be to obtain a standing x-ray.If the discomfort is mild, then we can certainly treat this as a simple hip flexor tendinitis.  I would apply some ice to the area and take some simple anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen.  Do not exercise. sometimes, physical therapy can help.But again if the pain is worsening he probably should have an x-ray to look at the RIGHT hip.  An MRI is not necessary at this time.I hope this information is useful for you.

Most of the time spurs in themselves do not cause pain. A more likely cause would be something like plantar fasciitis. I would advise some local icing and stretching of the calf.  Take some simple anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen.  Sometimes, physical therapy can help with this problem.  Occasionally, I will treat patients with a simple night splint.Sometimes if you have very flat feet then we will use orthotics to counteract this problem.I hope this information is useful for you.

Regarding to your symptoms, you could have mid cycle bleeding, so called spotting. Some women experience mid-cycle spotting around the time just after ovulation has occurred. This is thought to happen due to the drop in oestrogen mid-cycle, prior to ovulation. Because progesterone levels have yet to rise, a small amount of the endometrium may be shed.It is not something you should worry to much about, but my suggestion is to visit your gynecologist and make examination to exclude any severe condition. If your pain or bleeding becomes worse than visit your gynecologist immediately. I hope this answer was helpful to you."},{"Patient":"Last night, I got a mysterious pain in my hands, both in the lower palm area.

I will try to answer your question to the best of my ability.There could be several causes for this problem.  I would suggest that you see a primary care physician or an orthopaedic specialist, for a complete physical examination.  They will need to examine your shoulder in detail, and also examine your cervical spine.Issues that come to mind include a problem with the shoulder itself, for example, tendinitis, or capsulitis.  Another likely issue is that of referred pain from the cervical spine.  Sometimes, a disc problem in the neck can cause referred pain to the shoulder.  This results in sensations such as burning, tingling, or pain in the arm.In my particular practice, we would certainly consider taking some plain x-rays of the shoulder and cervical spine.

I will try to answer your question to the best of my ability.Night sweats aren’t rare: In one study published in Annals of Family Medicine, about a third of primary care patients reported night sweats during the past month. Several factors increase the likelihood of night sweats, including panic attacks, sleep problems, fever, numbness in hands and feet, anxiety and stress, and trouble breathing at night.Night sweats may also be a side effect of medication, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), commonly prescribed for depression.Very rarely night sweats could indicate a serious problem. They can be a symptom of autoimmune diseases, heart problems, endocrine disorders, gastroesophageal reflux disease, HIV, tuberculosis, certain cancers, sleep apnea, and panic disorders.I suggest monitoring your body temperature twice a day for a week to detect any fevers, and keeping a record of other symptoms to bring to your doc.

However, as you are telling that nerve study is normal, this cause is ruled out. Still I would recommend you to get vitamin B 12 levels done.As you are having this kind of pain only in evenings, I would like to know what kind of job you are doing like playing musical instrument/job which makes feet vibratory - then there are chances ofRaynaud's phenomenon. In this condition, people will experience numbness in feet with similar cold feeling. Cold stimulation test confirms it.We should also rule out hypothyroidism where few patient experience similar symptoms. Get T3, T4, and TSH done.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"I am a 25 year old male who has had a stich like aching pain one inch below my breast bone and two and half inches over about an inch below my rib cage on the right side for about six weeks. This pain started above my belly button and has since left and came back again and seemed to move all about a general are. What is so confusing about all of this is the different pains I am having. My ribs themselves hurt if I press on them they feel like they are bruised all over. My right side pain under my rib cage feels like its radiating around to my back. If I press on the area around my belly button it is sore. My right shoulder also has seemed to be sore the last week. I take medication that regularly makes me constipated during the day but the constipation has since gotten worse in the past two or three weeks. I had a spasm like episode in the exact localized spot im having pain about six weeks ago. It lasted for about 90 seconds. I had gotten into an argument and was very stressed but also had just eaten a VERY GREASY cheeseburger and drank 2 beers about 30 mins earlier ( I stopped drinking besides a beer or two every couple months in 2011) Any ideas what is happening to me?! Please help!","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks  for  your query.The pain at the bottom center of the rib cage could be due to a renal infection or a stone if the pain does not seem to be muscular in nature. This can be ruled out after getting an ultrasound scan done.If the pain is aggravated with deep breathing or coughing then a rib injury or a muscular sprain is likely.The other causes that need to be ruled out include lung infections like pleuritis.

Please advise.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks  for  your query.Cervical spondylosis is a common degenerative condition of the cervical spine and most likely caused by age-related changes in the intervertebral disks. Vertigo (dizziness) with this type of origin usually happen when the head is turned or tilted causing compression of the blood vessels that supply the part of the brain involved in balance. I advice you to wear a soft neck collar during the day to help limit neck motion and reduce nerve irritation. You can take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, Etoricoxib or Diclofen etc. for pain relief and muscle relaxants, particularly if neck muscle spasms occur after discussing with your doctor. Do exercises under guidance of a physical therapist to strengthen neck muscles and stretch the neck and shoulders. When you have episodes of dizziness (vertigo)- Do not lie flat on your back. Prop yourself up slightly to relieve the spinning sensation. Move slowly to avoid the risk of falling. Take rest. Resting will help prevent attacks of light-headedness. Do not drive a motor vehicle, operate equipment, or climb on a ladder while you are dizzy. Do not use substances that can affect your circulation, including caffeine, tobacco, alcohol.

The fluid can track down the leg and cause discomfort in the calf area. This is a benign condition and doesn't need any X-rays or scans etcYou can give him Tylenol or ibuprofen.

It is possible he may have something like a tendinitis or sometimes called epicondylitis.  This behaves very similar to a typical tennis elbow.Typical treatment would include the use of anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen.  You can apply ice if the area is tender and painful.

After which, I noticed a little soreness and pain in my lower left rib cage. I went to an urgent care and they diagnosed it as costochondritis. The doctor said it was an inflammed cartilage due to the pressure of the weights (my legs/knees were pressed against my rib cage).. I was wondering if that s true, or if it could be a problem with my spleen or maybe a hernia.","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for contacting us at \\"Ask a Doctor\\". I will try to answer your questions the best of my ability.I have reviewed your questions, and it is certainly possible that you have a so-called costochondritis.  The other possibility would be a simple intercostal muscle strain in the same region.  If you not have any swelling present then this is very unlikely to be something like a hernia.  Also, spleen problems do not present in this way, and so this would also be very unlikely.I think at this time it will be sensible to avoid any lifting.  You can certainly take over-the-counter remedies such as ibuprofen or Tylenol if it is particularly painful.  A local application of ice in the form of a bag of crushed ice applied for about 10 min. 4 or 5 times a day, would certainly help.  I would continue with this approach for the next 5-7 days.  If after this time, your symptoms are worse or you have developed any new symptoms I would certainly consult with your primary care physician.  At this time I do not see the need for further tests or x-rays, et cetera.  I feel confident that this condition will settle in due course.I hope this information is helpful.

Thank you, Berthe","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for contacting us at \\"Ask a Doctor\\". Instaflex does contain glucosamine. Even though glucosamine is technically a type of sugar, it doesn't appear to affect blood sugar levels or insulin sensitivity. Some preliminary research had suggested that glucosamine might worsen insulin resistance, which can contribute to increases in blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes. But subsequent studies refuted these findings.I think in your case it is safe to take Instaflex.  Just keep a close eye on your blood sugar for the first 10 days when you start taking it.

There is a form of tendinitis in the thumb area called de Quervain's Tenosynovitis. Without examining you it is difficult to tell but certainly this could be a possibility. In the first instance, I would ice the area for about 5-10 min, 6 times a day. Taking over-the-counter medications such as ibuprofen would certainly help.  Sometimes in the case of tendinitis we would prescribe a wrist and thumb brace.  This is sometimes called a thumb spica splint.  Occasionally for persistent tenosynovitis I will insert a small cortisone injection into the tendon sheath, which can give significant relief.I would suggest seeing your primary care physician or an orthopaedic specialist, for a further consultation.I hope this helps.

Some people like to take quinine for cramps which can help.Sometimes if you not wear appropriate, well supporting footwear this will cause pain in the arches of your feet. Wearing some well supported shoes can help this problem.  Sometimes it means, placing an arch support inside your shoes.

I'm sorry to hear about your injury - I'm a runner myself.If the pieces of broken bone have not been displaced by the force of the injury, you may not need surgery. That is to say that the fracture is stable. Casts or splints may be used to keep your knee straight. This will keep the broken ends in proper position while they heal.You will not be able to put any weight on your leg until the bone is completely healed. This may take 6 to 8 weeks, and perhaps longer. Most people use crutches during this period. After this you will need extensive physical therapy to include daily stretching and strengthening exercises at home and in the PT office.I would expect you to make a 100% recovery - but it will take time.

Thanks a lot.","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for contacting me at \\"Ask a Doctor\\". I will try to answer your question to the best of my ability. I sympathize with you having the knee pain.  I know this can be very frustrating.  From the sounds of it the MRI looks fairly unremarkable and so there is harvesting nothing of the surgical nature that needs to be done.  From your story, it sounds like you have typical patellofemoral pain.  This essentially involves some inflammation involving the undersurface of your kneecap.  For the moment.  I would avoid all sorts of knee exercises, including deep knee bends, squats, lunges, and weights.  Avoid the stairs if you can.  I would recommend taking over-the-counter ibuprofen as a pain reliever.Sometimes with persistent patellofemoral pain I will refer patients to a physical therapist for some stretching and strengthening exercises which can certainly help. Neck and also guide U as to when it is a good time to return to the gym.  For the moment.  You can do some upper body exercises and some gentle cardio work, for example swimming.  I would not do any running or biking if the knee is still sore at this time. Occasionally if the above conservative management do not help, I will consider an intra-articular cortisone injection, but will only do this if we have exhausted all the treatment options above.I hope this information is useful for you.

There are also some balance exercises that you can perform later in the rehabilitation process.I think your most likely make a full recovery over the next 3 or 4 weeks.  I wish you the best of luckI hope this information is useful for you. Please do not hesitate to message us back if you have any further questions.Best wishes,Adrian Rawlinson MD"},{"Patient":"I was thinking about gettin ets hand surgery. I am aware of the possibility of compository sweating but was wondering if this surgery of destroying part of the nervous system can change my mood and behavior and overall personality. I do not want that to change or anything internally just for my external sweaty hands to stop.","Doctor":"Hi.You need to discuss this with ur operating surgeon. All possible complications of any procedure one plans to go through should be known to oneself also the chances of there occurance should be discussed."},{"Patient":"A couple days ago, I banged the side of my shin below the knee and instantly developed a swollen bruise. It is about 3 inches long and egg shaped. After the injury I have achy pain in my ankle and on and off in my calf. Should I get it looked at? Or did I possibly do some nerve damage? I didn t hit the calf or ankle which is why I m concerned. Thank you!","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks  for  your query.From description it seems to be soft tissue injury . Swollen bruise might be due to haematomaformation(collection of blood).You need an x-ray to rule out any bony injury. I suggest you to consult an orthopaedician nearby for a detailed examination. You may get the X-ray of the area affected under his/her guidance. Beside icing and elevating it, you can take anti-inflammatory drug like motrin to reduce pain and inflammation.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"Have had swelling on ankles, toes and feet also with a rash around the legs looks like i m wearing socks. started having muscle cramps and when done i bruise at that spot. have had blood work no answers. told to take allegra seems to help with swelling but still other symptoms i just ache all over","Doctor":"Hello, I had gone through the case and have concerned with you.

The chances are that these are completely benign lumps - that is to say that they are nothing serious. There are lots of different benign lumps in the skin. Examples would include lipomas, sebaceous cysts, fibromas etc.  Most of the time we advise to leave them alone. If they start to cause symptoms (eg pain, numbness, increasing in size etc) then we advise surgical removal.I hope this helps.Best wishes,Adrian Rawlinson MD"},{"Patient":"I have had muscle tightness and pain in my legs for several years. I have a stent in each of my iliac veins but have notice problem with balance, more muscle stiffness and my left leg is far worse than right. I get very tired and have noticed issues with my eyes as well. have had 9 stents and recently had bypass. I am wondering if we are missing something else.","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for contacting ‘Ask a Doctor’. I will try to address your concerns to the best of my ability. It sounds as though you need to have a doctor look at your low back area and your hips. There is a condition in the lumbar spine called spinal stenosis that can cause symptoms in your legs. Arthritis of the hip and/or spine can also cause stiffness.I would start by getting some simple x-rays. If the x-rays look good then a course of physical therapy would be worth trying. The PT can teach you some exercises and stretches that you can do at home. I hope this helps.Best wishes,Adrian Rawlinson MD"},{"Patient":"I put my laptop on my abdomen while laying down and suing it.lately i started feeling pain in my abdomen after i use my laptop when laying down and started to feel laptop heat effecting me. any reason for that ? also earlier i got diarrhea for few days . are these connected ?","Doctor":"Hello, welcome to healthcare magic forum,No these are separate things not connected to each other may be due to sitting for long time you will have pain in abdomen muscular pain, need not to worry, diarrhea is due to infection in stomach due to some infected food intake.Regards."},{"Patient":"The bone of my upper arm was broken 14 years ago.

I will try to address your concerns to the best of my ability. Sometimes after a fracture you can develop arthritis. This can happen several years after the initial injury. On the other hand your pain may be totally unrelated to the previous injury. Other problems include things such as tendonitis or bursitis. I would see your primary care doctor and maybe get some x rays. I hope this helps.Best wishes,Adrian Rawlinson MD"},{"Patient":"my 15 year old daughter started with pain in her right lower back in February She is a competitive dancer but there was no point of injury - just one day she began hurting. We initially went to the chiropractor and he advised that her hips were out of alignment but she continued to complain of nerve pain down the same leg and he referred her for MRI of low back - which showed nothing abnormal. We then went to the orthopedic and they thought bursitis, so we did a cortisone injection which did not help at all, there we also did a round of prednisone and visits to PT - no change, if anything only continues to get worse. Then 2nd orthopedic thought it was the SI joint and did a 2nd injection - again no relief. He then ordered bone scan and it revealed nothing abnormal. He ordered blood work with only showed slight elevation of the antinuclear antibody 1-80, which he advised was not anything to be alarmed over. However RA does run in my family and my moms sister has been diagnosis with Lupus . He insists that it is just a dance related injury that will require rest. She has been resting and not dancing since February and continues to get worse and has swelling in the lower back and is very sensitive to touch. We are now seeing a chiropractor again which upon xrays revealed that her hips are out of alignment and somewhat rotated as well as curve in the spine. We are 10 visits in and no relief. She has taken advil daily for months and no relief. I do not know where to go next? Do you think I should be concerned about lupus or ra? continue with chiropractor? I am one frustrated mom - not only is this effecting dance she really can t do much of anything without pain - missed a day at the beach with youth group this week because she just felt to bad to go - very unlike her!","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for contacting ‘Ask a Doctor’. I will try to address your concerns to the best of my ability. I see a lot of athletes with back pain. If the MRI is normal then the problem is likely mechanical in origin. That means there is some possible overuse in the soft tissues. Often times in these cases, even with tests like an MRI, it is very difficult to give you a specific anatomical diagnosis.My advice would be;1. No dancing for the moment - gentle activity like swimming would be fine.2. See a good physical therapist who can do a good biomechanical assessment and put your daughter on a good home rehab program - to include stretching and strengthening exercises.3. Over the counter meds such as ibupropfen or tylenol. Or a prescription anti inflammatory from your MD.4. No further tests at this time.Often there are no 'quick fixes' for these problems - hang in there. I'm sure it will improve soon.I hope this helps.Best wishes,Adrian Rawlinson MD"},{"Patient":"I had a mri dr told me I have a cracked disc and a piece has broken off an floating around also I have a large tare that is leaking fluid he said I need a disc replaced as well as 2 bars put in an fuse the lower back? is this a common thing to repair the problem an how major is the surgery?","Doctor":"Dear patient Spine surgery is considered  major surgery and as per your description  you have got sequestered disc that needs to be excised to get relief  from back pain and lower limb sensory symptoms.

I cannot bend my big toe (which is the area where the pain originates, in the foot part just below my big toe) not because of the pain, but I physically cannot make it bend. It hurts to walk on the affected area but I can walk. I just cannot put weight on the big toe. It is painful with a mixture between dull and achy and suddenly sharp or throbbing. Though, I took a Vicodin and the pain is a lot better. The pain is more localized and the areas around it hurt less allowing me to put weight on those areas. Does this sound more like it could be a sprain since the pain medication helped with almost all of the pain aside from the milder pain I feel in the location of the bruise and swelling?","Doctor":"Dear patient You have injured your foot more so your great toe and  possibility of fracture cannot be ruled out since pain is not relieved.  I would advise Xray of involved foot anteroposterior and oblique views to confirm diagnosis.  If it shows fracture  you need to consult expert orthopaedic surgeon with report.

Don't suddenly stop taking steroid medication unless a doctor in charge of your care tells you it's safe to do so. Suddenly stopping treatment with steroids can make you feel very ill.Some people are prescribed immunosuppressant medication, such as methotrexate. This is used to reduce or suppress the immune system (the body's defence against infection and illness). It may be helpful for people with polymyalgia rheumatica who have frequent relapses or don't respond to normal steroid treatment.Your doctor may recommend painkillers, such as paracetamol, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), to help relieve pain and stiffness while your dose of prednisolone is reduced.I hope my advice would have been useful, in decision making regarding your treatment, still if you have any clarifications or doubts feel free to contact back.Thanks."},{"Patient":"I m not sure what s going on with my leg..

I'm sorry you had to go through all this - RSD is a very painful and debilitating condition.There are several factors that can help with the healing process. Make sure you eat well - a good balanced diet with lots of fruit and vegetables. If you are carrying any extra weight, then certainly losing a few pounds will help. If you carry less weight this means less stress on your feet - including the sesamoids. Make sure you wear well padded shoes - you might want to insert a simple gel insert in your shoes. You can buy these from your local pharmacy. Make sure you put them in both shoes.Try to avoid aggravating the sesamoid area by limiting your walking to no longer than 15 mins at a time.It is very difficult to give you a specific time frame for recovery - everyone is different - and there are many factors to be taken in consideration. I have seen people get better in anything from 1 to 6 months.I hope this helps.

I would suggest that you get him assessed in an ER or Urgent Care. The bleeding from the nose should stop with simple localized pressure.

Area) is there any concern from the scratch or is this something totally different? No swelling and no rash.","Doctor":"Hi Thank you for contacting us. I will to address your concerns to the best of my ability. The single most important thing to rule out here is an infection. Antibiotics are prescribed for bite wounds to prevent infection in certain situations. For example, if:1.You have been bitten by a cat. All cat bites are usually treated with antibiotics, as they are much more likely to get infected than dog bites.2.The bite wound is on an arm or leg - especially a hand. These sites are particularly prone to nasty infections that can cause severe damage after a dog or cat bite.3.The wound is large, deep or punctured. A puncture wound may not look large but may go deep into the tissues.4.Your injury needed an operation to clean it out, or repair the damage.5.Your resistance to infection is low. For example, if you are on chemotherapy; have no working spleen; have diabetes; have an immune system problem such as AIDS.6.You have an artificial heart valve (and sometimes, if you have an artificial joint).Antibiotics will also be prescribed if your wound has already become infected. It might be infected if:It is getting more painful rather than improving as time goes by.It has become red or swollen.It is oozing.Sometimes the doctor's exam will discover some red lines in the skin of the arm - this is known as lymphangitis - this also needs antibiotics.Best to get this checked by your doctor as soon as possible.

I slowly proceeded back into the house and sit down on a chair. I felt very light headed, sweating but cold at the same time, blurred vision, i then took a cataflam pill as well as a myprodol pill. I can feel that the intensity of the pain lowered by now but if I move my ankle slightly to the sides it hurts and when I move it up and down it sounds like a clicking noise and it burns inside. Can you please provide me with some feedback. Thank you. Marinda","Doctor":"Dear patient You have injured  your ankle and possibility  of fracture  cannot be ruled out. I would advise Xray of involved  ankle with tibia fibula anteroposterior and lateral views to rule out bony abnormalities. If report shows fracture  you need to consult expert orthopaedic surgeon nearby you urgently and avoid taking weight on involved ankle. If Xray report is normal diagnosis is sprain and treatment  is 1. Crepe  bandage application   and rest for 3 weeks 2. Avoid putting weight on involved  ankle 3. Take tab diclofenac plus serratiopeptodase combination twice a day for 5 days for pain relief. 4. Ice packs frequently  to reduce  swelling and inflammation.

I have been having dull pain on my left abdomen for the last week or 2 (worse after eating or drinking and thought to be spleen being crowded by other organs), but now the pain is greatly increased and radiating into the upper tip of my left shoulder (worse on lying down and on inspiration). Ideas? Thanks, Wendy","Doctor":"HI.The spleen causing such a pain is not known unless there is a rapture or so.The pain which gets worst on eating or drinking can usually be due to an ulcer in the stomach or the inflammation of the pancreas. The refereed pain on the left shoulder can be due to the irritation of the  under-surface of the diaphragm by perforation of the stomach ulcer/ pancreatitis/ splenic abscess.You have to really rush to the ER, get a reference/ admission in the hospital, urgent investigations like the ultrasonography/ CT scan ./ Upper GI endoscopy/ blood tests ."},{"Patient":"I have had consistent left flank pain. I am currently on cipro 500mg two times a day for kidney infection. I am on second week of four week dose.

It is just below my ribs in my back on the left side and at times comes around to the side and front. It seems worse after I eat or drink and mornings and evenings. Help","Doctor":"Dear patient As per your description  pain is located in left renal angle and most common reason is kidney  pathology  and kidney stone.since you are having renal infection this diagnosis  is highly likely. Infection in kidney might heal but damage to renal parenchyma persists and this is responsible  for pain. You need to consult  expert nephrologist nearby your area and get yourself  examined. Investigation required are 1. Ultrasound of kidney ureter and bladder 2. Intravenous pyelography 3. Ct scan abdomen plain SOS contrast.

Inflammation around coccyx 2. Formation of bursa. Since you have not met with trauma possibility  of fracture is remote but I would like to advise Xray of sacrum anteroposterior and lateral views to rule out bony abnormalities.

I am 53 femal","Doctor":"Dear patient Your right thigh muscles are getting fatigue easily and reason for that might be arterial stenosis. This leads to decreased blood supply to working muscles especially when they are excersising  and has increased  demand for blood and oxygen  as per your description. When you take rest demand for blood is reduced and hence pain is relieved.  Are you smoker?  If yes stenosis is likely. This need to be investigated  with  arterial doppler of involved  limb and ct angiography  of involved  limb vessels. Visit radiology center nearby you and get it done.  You needs to consult expert vascular surgeon with report. All the best."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor , I am 17 years old .

Type of reduction and stability achieved by surgery 3. Simple or compound fracture 3. Smoking and alcohol  habit  etc. So you need to regular follow up with your operating  surgeon monthly and xrays every monthly.

Last month a new podiatrist i saw asked for MRI and the report showed Tenosynovitis of the preoneus brevis and longus tendons with peroneal brevis tendinitis without tear , no other issues anywhere in the multiplanar multisequence imaging. He recommended an ankle brace for 6 weeks, 2 weeks into using it, the pain is more persistent than before and also the degree of pain much higher. Next options according to him are ankle arthocoscopy with synorectomy. Physical therapy can be tried but he doesn t think it will help much. He is not for using steroid injections as that will mask the pain and not treat it. I am looking for options","Doctor":"Dear patient You have got peroneus  longus  and brevis  tendon synovitis and that is not benefited by ankle brace. Next line of management  is local depomedrol  injection and it's very beneficial. It not only relieves pain but also relieves inflammation  and reduces synovitis. In some cases it provides permanent relief and it's safe procedure without side effects and is opd procedure. So its worthwhile to take a chance and upto three injections  can be given. If steroid injection  is not helping you can go for surgery afterwards  also. So I would recommend local steroid injection   under ultrasound  guidance.If not relieved go for synovectomy  either open or arthroscopic.

Now once you start with this along with protein powder for muscle strength I am sure you will be able to do physio also properly for further exercises and rehabilitation.Suppose if your rhematoid report comes positive then take suggestion on medication with doctor but also consult a dietician for anti inflammatory diet because this too helps a lot in pain relief.Also use hot and cold pack when ever it pains a lot but prepare your self mentally and keep doing exercises for rehabilitation.I am sure this will help you if you follow the suggestion properly.Take care."},{"Patient":"I just had a CT Soft Tissue Neck with Contrast because of pain and swelling under my left jaw line.

All glands are normal, No treatment from my doctor, although I am in constant pain under my left jaw bone, what can I do?","Doctor":"It may be related with infection and swelling in mandibular gland tissue, it can also be a toth related issue. I suggest to check with dental and if everything is fine with tooth then start taking anti biotic( amoxicillin) and pain killer,anti inflammatory tablets along with hot and cold pack use at painful area below jaw.Also do not eat any thing hard on affected side and even do use only warm water to drink as well as for doing gargling after brushing teeth. And keep cotton in your ear while traveling. Do not get expose to cold environment as well do not have cold drinks.If there is infection or inflammation it will be over with this. But if it does not get over then I suggest to talk to your doctor and take a MRI scan for further evaluation. But I am sure if its just swelling at mandibular gland then it will be fine with this.

What can I do to get some sleep, my ankles are not swollen but just very achy. I wear good shoes like Birkenstocks and they are fine throughout the day.","Doctor":"Here your sleeplessness problem could be because of pain in ankle and feet. And this pain you experience only in night after your entire day work. It means either you do lots of standing and walking work or your shoes are not comfortable for your feet or you have weak bones with deficiency of vitamin d and calcium.Shoes you are using a good brand as per you and you are comfortable so it may not be a issue.Check your day activity if it involves too much of standing and walking work then I suggest to take break in berween or take a break from job for few days.Next is you need to check with bone mineral density test to know your bone strength as well do blood report to know about calcium and vitamin D level. If its deficiency then take calcium and vitamin d natural suppliment as per your doctor advice.I am sure one of this or in combination there will be a problem with you and you need to do needful as per that. I also suggest to deep your leg in hot water daily before you go to sleep for 15-20 minutes and keep it floating in hot water so water can touch your feet and ankle from all around. This will also helps to give a pain relief and good sleep.Follow the suggestion and I am sure it should help you.

Along with the cellulitis and shingles while the patient is on treatment for this the body's own immune system is fighting against the infection and so that there will be more inflammation and due to that there will be fever and weakness in muscles and due to that the pain in neck, shoulder and arm is possible.I suggest to check with orthopedic doctor and after examination take synptomatic treatment or needed treatment along with physiotherapy treatment to have relief from pain.And keep using hot and cold pack regularly as well apply pain relieving ointment too after use of hot pack immediately to have some more pain relief.I am sure this will help you if you follow it step by step as per my suggestion.

If yes then it can be related with neck pain. If there is no neck pain and pain starts only from shoulder level then it can be due to shoulder arthritis too. And if your pain is kind of radiating pain then it can be due to hypersensitivity of your upper arm nerves which is disturbed at either shoulder level or neck level or arm level.I suggest you should visit a orthopedic for proper examination and evaluation. Here he also need to see the size and location of the lump which you are talking about. Based on the diagnosis doctor will suggest for surgical opinion for cervical, shoulder or for lump area if there is any thing major.

Here orthopedic will check the symptoms and will evaluate it. If there is no issue with facial nerve then you may need to go ahead with cervical MRI scan and based in report he will suggest for the medication and physiotherapy treatment for mild to moderate issues. But if there is major damage to cervical spine which I feel there won't be, then he may suggest for surgical correction and then physiotherapy rehabilitation.How ever if there is problem with facial nerve also you need to visit a physio for facial muscle exercises and take advice on precautions like do not have any thing cold food item like ice cream, cold drink etc. As well keep ear bud when ever you go out because the cold air should not go to your ear.

This will also give you good relief.I have given here general guideline but I am sure it will be useful if you follow it well.Take care."},{"Patient":"hi, i have an accedient since 27/10/2013 broken tib and fib i have a surgery on 27/10/2013 and IM rod placed inside tibia till now i have a lot of pain in broken area doc said that it takes a time for tibia to heal plus there are a gap in bone , some doctors said that we can cut a peace of fib round 2 cm and do bone marrow for tib , another one want to do bone grafting others say that we just need more time so what i have to choose","Doctor":"Here you need to know if its a normal fracture with just a cut in bone it takes 1 month to heal, if there is cut with segmental fracture where the fracture piece is not in touch with bone above and bone below then it takes 2-3 months time to heal. But if there is segmental fracture along with crushed bone pieces then it takes 4-6 month time to heal.Now here you need to see which kind of fracture you are having along with this age as well your diet and calcium with vitamin D tablets also matter a lot for healing.Here you have inform some of the doctors have suggested for bone grafting and some of the doctors have suggested to wait. I suggest if your fracture is healing and is better then what it was before after few months on x ray then Dont worry it will be all right. It may take some time. You need to have good enough of calcium with vitamin D in diet as well as suppliment. But if there is no healing sign even after 3-4 month and it is still as it is means you can try with calcium and vitamin D suppliment for 2 month and see later on x ray. Or else you can go ahead for surgery that is bone grafting. If its paining too much then make sure there is no infection as well no displacement of implant. And you can keep using hot and cold pack for some more relief.I have give you here general guideline but I am sure this will be useful for you.Take care."},{"Patient":"SL4 S1 spinal fusion 6 months ago.

Another item I ve notice is that the leg seems to be cold to the touch. Is this normal for a sprain? I did not have an MRI but I have called by family doctor to look again at the xrays.

Usual way of taking treatment is as below: Dapsone, which is bacteriostatic or weakly bactericidal against M. leprae, was the mainstay treatment for leprosy for many years until widespread resistant strains appeared. Combination therapy has become essential to slow or prevent the development of resistance. Rifampicin is now combined with dapsone to treat paucibacillary leprosy. Rifampicin and clofazimine are now combined with dapsone to treat multibacillary leprosy.Now for nerve pain generally specific treatment is not there but you can take nerve block injection to reduce pain as well do regular physiotherapy to improve the functional ability along with muscle girth. It will also help to give you some more pain relief.Once you get over with your problem of leprosy I suggest to have good enough omega 3 suppliment  on a regular basis. Because this omega 3 is a insulation material for nerves which will help you to recover even better and early.Further I suggest to talk to your doctor for detail discussion. You may take secondary opinion from another well known doctor too if needed.Here I have given you general guideline but specific suggestion can be given only after complite check up and examination only. How ever I still suggest to follow the steps I have suggested and I am sure this will be helpful for you.Take care."},{"Patient":"HI, a few months ago I had an ultrasound on a lump on my right shoulder (lump has been present for 10yrs) and the monographer said it was a calcified lymph node.

It is still very painful and I can t wear shoe across the front of my foot. Not sure if I need to do anything","Doctor":"Hello,I have studied your case and I think that you need to get x ray of the foot as some time there can be fracture in the foot due to such fall. If there is any such injury than you might need splinting of the foot.  If there is no fracture than you just need to apply compression bandage and hot water fomentation. You should also take oral antibiotics so that this hematoma is not get infected.    Hot water fomentation is also useful.I hope these steps will be helpful for you.

Meniscus tear surgery patient usually complains of thigh and calf pain. It is not a serious issue. I hope your doctor has asked you to start walking. Ankle exercise and waking will take care of calf pain.Some time very tight compression bandage is also cause of this.    If this pain remain for more than 12 hours or increases than you need to get Doppler examination of the calf muscles to make sure that it is not a clot. You might need to take tablet Brufen if pain is very severe.I hope this answer will be useful for you.

So I am a 21 years old female, very healthy and physically active as a rock climbing instructor at a university and a ski patroller. when I was like 6 our family doctor diagnosed me with femoral anteversion in both legs, with the right being worse than the left. (I can rotate my leg completely to the side at a90 degree angle with my toes pointing up) I have had special shoes, therapy, muscle work and for a short time a leg brace, which all came to no avail, Unfortunately I wasn t one of the lucky ones that grew out of it, so just learnt to live with it. When I was around 12 I started to suffer pain in my legs and hips, and surgery was suggested to my parents, however they decided they didn t want to put me through what was back then quite a risky procedure so we waited it out. Now i m 21 and as the pain and discomfort has worsened and now both my knees and ankles hurt. Plus when I look down at my right ankle, the bone seems to rest on the inward side of the foot so is off balance and painful to walk. The type of procedure that has been discussed is one where both my legs are broken at certain points, then realigned and pinned in place. I am studying law enforcement and this would take 6-8 months to heal they said.... I was wondering if any of you had undergone any similar procedures/experiences and what your thoughts about it were; how long did it take you to recover? How long were you immobile for? How would you rate the pain? Any other info you think would benefit me? If surgery is the only option then do you know of any doctors in WA state USA that perform it? Is it a safe surgery? YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Dear patient Best option for excessive femoral anteversion is surgery.  As you said during surgery bone is broken at intertrchanteric region deformity is corrected and fixed in place with the help of screws and plates. You have to take rest toll broken realigned bones are united.  Usual period is 2 to 3 months of rest as you have to undergo surgery on both hips.  Surgery is type of major surgery but complication rate is very less and is effective for relieving symptoms. Pain medication are usually not required once stitches are removed. So you should not waste more time and take visit  to expert orthopaedic surgeon nearby your area and get it done asap."},{"Patient":"Hello My name is David I m 22yrs Old.

Is this just a bad sprain or could I have broken something?","Doctor":"Dear patient Since you have pain and swelling on left foot after twisting injury and not getting better possibility  of fracture needs to be ruled out.  I would advise Xray of left foot anteroposterior  and oblique  views. Visit radiology center nearby you and get it.  If report shows fracture you need to consult expert orthopaedic surgeon nearby you and get yourself examined.  If there is no fracture  diagnosis  is sprain and treatment  is application  of crepe  bandage  for 3 weeks and rest and elevation.  Take tab diclofenac plus serratiopeptodase combination twice a day for pain and swelling  relief. All the best."},{"Patient":"Hi, My son started complaining about stomach pain yesterday night, and fever was there.In mid night he started with loose motion with green color water.I took him to doctor, and prescribed with Metrogyl, Calpol with 5 days.

Any info you can supply would be very appreciated","Doctor":"Dear patient Where is the  swelling?  If it's lying  on outer aspect of thigh it's not great saphenous vein as it is deep and lies on inner aspect of thigh. So first of all we have to confirm diagnosis.  I would like to advise ultrasound  and venous doppler of your thigh to confirm diagnosis. If it's superficial blood clot only  it will take time to disappear. Even if it's thrombophlebitis  of superficial vein swelling may persist for months. Visit radiology center nearby you and get it done.  You need to consult  vascular surgeon with report.

He recently had a PET scan which revealed he had no tumors. He never feels well, I was looking at the symptoms of fibromyalgia and he has everyone of them. Could it be he has this disease now?","Doctor":"Treatment for fibromylgia is first relax your body and mind because the symptoms are more when you are in stress and anxiety.Next you can use cold pack and hot pack to pain full muscles alternately to relax the soft tissue.You can also take physio therapy treatment for some more relaxing and healing effect on soft tissues. Here physio therapist will also suggest for few more stretching and muscle tonning exercises do follow that gradually. Also take suggestion on postural correction and follow it.There are couple of medications can be suggested but since he is already on cancer treatment I suggest that should be suggested by your oncologist only. And it may possible that he has pain because of prolong treatment of cancer with more stress on body and no physical exercises.  and it may not be fibromylgia. So you can also discuss about this in detail with your oncologist to have further guidance.I am sure he will be fine with muscular pain if you follow the above steps.Take care."},{"Patient":"I have been taking levofloxacin for 7 days after a prior antibiotic (cipro) failed to fix a kidney strep infection.

Do needed test like knee x-ray and MRI scanning if needed. Now plan your treatment as per the diagnosis. For minor to moderate problem doctor will suggest for physio and medication. This will help you to get pain relief. Also do regular knee strengthening exercises as per suggested by physio.For major damage in knee doctor will suggest for surgery only it can be corrective or replacement of knee joint.

Now in the urine test I found my epithelial cells are upto 9 H.P.F & pus cells are 2 HPF. sometimes feeling breathing problem. pls suggest whats the reason of this & the solution. thank u.","Doctor":"Pain in kidney area and swollen feet indicates few things. Either your blood pressure is fluctuating and so that you have swelling in legs or there is a problem with kidney ( kidney stone or dysfunction)Here you have also given report of your urine examination and I saw the epithelial cells are more as well pus cells are on borderline. But you have not updated serum uric acid level. This indicates problem with kidney. It can also be called as nephritic syndrome.For further detail diagnosis I suggest to visit a nephrologists and do ultrasound of abdomen as well check serum uric acid  to check the possibilities of kidney issues. And plan treatment as per the diagnosis. For symptomatic relief I suggest to to do frequent ankle toe movements. This will help to prevent swelling in feet. To control uric acid level you need to take diet suggestion, as well should do proper regular exercises also.Here I have given you general guidelines because Uric acid level is not sure as well past medical history and physical examination not available. Still you can follow it step by step and it will be helpful.Take care."},{"Patient":"I have pain in my groins particular my left one and I am a hiker and I had a fall today and it s much worse , I also find a pain in each of my bum muscles sometimes after walking have you any idea why . I am normally a very healthy person who eats healthily 5.6 and weigh 9 and a half stone","Doctor":"The most common cause of groin pain is muscle, tendon or ligament strain. Groin pain may occur immediately after an injury, or pain may come on gradually over a period of weeks or even months. Groin pain may be worsened by continued use of the injured area.Less commonly, a bone injury or fracture, a hernia, or even kidney stones may cause groin pain. Although testicle pain and groin pain are different, a testicle condition can sometimes cause pain that spreads to the groin area.In your case I suggest to visit a doctor for proer examination and treatment. Here doctor may ask you for some test like x ray or scan as per need. I suggest to go ahead for it and later plan treatment as per the diagnosis.If there is a minor to moderate issue at soft tissue level then use of cold pack along with physiotherapy and rest will help to get cure.In case if anything major issue like hernia or ligamental injury etc. As per the diagnosis surgical correction or repair also be needed.And after it again physiotherapy rehabilitation will help you.Here since i have not done physical examination. As per symptoms I have given you some guideline and I am sure it will be helpful if you follow it properly.Take care."},{"Patient":"I ended chemo and radiation on February 2013.

Once I rest for 30 minutes its fine and back to normal. I have got by with it but it is starting to impact on my normal everyday life as the weakness comes a lot sooner now. Just walking around the shops and I can start to feel the weakness in my left leg. Just cutting the grass today was a struggle. the left leg is significantly weaker than the right one and sometimes when the leg is bent it sometimes feels like I am going to fall over. I have no pain anywhere on my body. I had an episode in 2007 for about 3 months where I lost strength in my left leg for about 10 seconds when I was running and then it would be fine. This just corrected itself after 3 months and went away I am considering getting some steroids to help improve my muscle strength.","Doctor":"Dear Sir/MadamI have gone through your query and read your symptoms.In my opinion, you have developed an misconception, no steroids are going to help you. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE STEROIDS.Now your symptoms are of spinal canal stenosis, which is a condition where the diameter of the canal from where the nerves come become less and gradually with work causes weakness, pain, and numbness in the legs. this can be easily seen with an MRI of the spine. Please consult a spine surgeon or a neurolgist and get yourself examined and evaluated.I hope that answers your query.

After surgery I had what I know now was a kinked intestine which eventually broke open and resulted in a removal of 6 of small intestine. (This is after I had complained to my surgeon and the pain was diagnosed as gastritis and did no follow through testing). The part that I am concerned about is that when I arrived at the hospital emergency and my doctor showed up, he proceeded to operate with the diagnosis of a hole in my stomach even though I told him I have never had stomach problems, and had told him of the symptoms that clearly described a bowel obstruction! So the operation took 3 hours of him searching through intestines, scoping the stomach also before finding the perforation and repairing. I now have some bouts of abdominal pain (adhesions?) that seems to last for a few days then gets better. I went to my family doctor when this happened, and he did an xray without contrast that showed I was constipated. I have two questions: Will I have a chronic pain from adhesions from the surgeon handling my intestines and taking a long time/drying out or do they typically keep them wet and practice care in handling? Could the pain I feeling just be from constipation, even though it never caused pain before and would the adhesions cause constipation?","Doctor":"HI.A bit confusing picture.Let us solve the maize one by one. You had a surgery for ''entrapped hernia''. This itself predisposes to the chance of recurrent obstruction. Entrapped hernia can ooze a lot of fluid rich in bacteria.Well this is the first part.This can cause also a perforation as was told to you.  and was repaired too.Very true - the dried bowel can cause tis. But the first teaching to the Surgeons and the nurses is never allow them to dry-up.The abdominal fluid is always there and does not allow the drying - this is by personal experience. So forget about drying -up theory.  If the pain started just after the surgery, the kinking/ obstruction is a possibility.You have undergone surgery one and half year ago and if the pain is of recent origin, it is very difficult to comment upon the cause. It is probably due to constipation and which may in turn be causing recurrent pains.The best way to see this is called an ''enteroclysis''- meaning contrast X-rays after the tube is passed in the duodenum directly ( helps getting better picture than the routine barium studies. This will help you/us get a clear picture.A routine enema for evacuation of the bowel is the best solution to find whether this helps relieve the pain or not."},{"Patient":"sometimes but not always, when I strain a bit to go to the bathroom or move in an odd way I get a pretty good pain in my side like near the rib, it usually goes away pretty fast but almost feel like a severe cramp or charlie horse and it is painful, been happening for years and usually on the left side","Doctor":"hello,Some amount of cramps in left side of rib cage can be due to low salt and calcium in body.

I am 30 years old female and my height is 5 6 and weight is 82 kg.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks  for  your query.pins and needles sensation and numbness,tingling in the thigh can be referred from the spine, the hip joint or from the bone and muscle in the thigh itself. A physical examination would indicate to a physician the likely site of the pain which could be further investigated with X-rays of your spine, hip and femur.The nature of your pain suggests to me that this is more likely a hip joint or thigh muscle problem. If the pain is coming from your hip joint the most common diagnosis at your age would be osteoarthritis of the hip joint. A strain of the quadriceps muscle can also cause such pain, which will likely improve over a period of 2-3 weeks. Antiinflammatory medciation, physiotherapy, massage may help your symptoms in the interim.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"Hi iam 37years old and had sprained my neck 2-3weeks back and then started tingling in my head on left side my doctor checked me and gave me anti inflammatory drugs and muscle relaxant for 1week and some neck exercises she advised.it got better after that treatment.and again when I lifted some weight same problem started is there a problem with my collar bone or nerve damage in my head which is causing me the same symptoms.both are related to each other when pain starts on my shoulder on collarbone again tingling starts can u help me diagnose my problem.

Thank you if anyone could help out with any info.","Doctor":"Hello,I have studied your case.Most probably it is due to either a nerve compression at groin or in the spine. It is called meralgia parasthetica. You need to see a neurologist to confirm the diagnosis and treat accordingly.I would recommend you to take tablet Pregabalin and methylcobal daily at night time.make sure that your blood sugar is under control.Steroid injection can be given if pain is also there .I hope these steps will be helpful for you.

I was out working on 8/12/14 late (was on vacation the prior week at a beach) and noticed my left leg going slightly numb. Woke up and still that way next day. It moved to my left leg. I started getting pins and needles all over my body. Yesterday and today my legs and arms are heavy and my legs feel as if I ve worked out but I haven t. I m getting muscle spasms/ twitching in my legs, no appetite and when I do force myself to eat it feels as if I m going to have diarrhea. Went to my sons football game today and was getting pretty nervous as I was getting tingling in my fingers, went to stand up and felt real weak as if I was going to pass out so panick came in and I made a dash to my car. I went to the ER ekg was fine and what blood work they did was fine. I know they can t do everything at a ER but what they do do was fine ad far as results were. I would like too know what could be going on as I don t know how I m supposed to function like this. (Also I laid down to take a nap earlier and my skin felt very hot but no fever, I did sweat a little while sleeping, stomach was also feeling very strange and uncomfortable). Any ideas? Thanks","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks  for  your query.The abnormal sensations that you have such as pin and needles sensation, burning, tingling are termed peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral Neuropathy is a condition caused by damage to the peripheral nervous system [most commonly seen in diabetic patients]. Another possibility could be nerve compression in spine due to disc bulge.Change your diet and remove inflammatory foods such as citrus fruits, dairy products and wheat that may aggravate the condition. Simultaneously increase your intake of potassium and calcium-rich foods such as bananas and avocados and green leafy vegetablesVitamin B12 is important in the maintenance of health and normal functioning of the nerve tissue and deficiency of it can lead to numbness. You can increase B12 level by taking meat and fish, or you can take tab methylcobalamine .I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"I have had a neck/back pain that affects my left arm.

As I said, it has gotten better over the past couple days, but still don t have full mobility and still a dull pain when relaxed and more intense of I tilt or turn my head for far to the right. I noticed two days a go that I have a small, hard, pea sized lump on the left side. It seems to be on the tendon that runs down the side of my neck into the back. The lump is about half way up the length of my neck and is about half way between the spine and the ear. When I push on it kind of hurts but at the same time gives relief and it kind of seems like the pain may be radiating from there (At the worst I had pain all through my spine, shoulders and neck but it is now just that tendon that seems to hurt).

If you have bruxism, you may unconsciously clench your teeth together during the day, or clench or grind them at night (sleep bruxism). But it does not cause neck pain.Here you have symptoms of sore and stiff neck along with lump near to your neck spine. Its good that you are getting better day by day. But since you have told that this happens regularly and before also you had pain and stiffness like this I suggest once you need to diagnose it properly and take steps on prevention of it again.Here you can check in lump if it is increasing in size and if it is painful then you need to visit doctor for proper examination and evaluation. Similarly since your neck movement is still not free so I suggest to visit orthopedic doctor here doctor will check your neck with physical tests and if needed will suggest for x-ray and MRI scaning too.I suggest to go ahead for it. Here based on evaluation and scaning report if there is a mild to moderate problem with soft tissue and spine then with few medication he will suggest you for physiotherapy treatment for further relief. If there is major problem in spine or the lump then doctor will suggest for surgical correction and then physiotherapy management to give further relief.Here do not forget on taking advice on postural correction and spinal exercises to follow it regularly for prevention of pain.You can also use hot and cold pack for having some more relief.I am sure it will be useful for you if you follow all above steps.

You can visit a good dermatologist for proper examination and treatment for the dark depression. You may need to go for some skin test to rule out there is nothing major problem with skin and then doctor will suggest you either conservative management with ointment and medication or it can be surgical to correct the depression and color of skin.

He is struggling to walk and talk, and lift his head when he stands. He has lost a lot of weight and muscle. I think I know the answer, but is the nerve damage permanent, and how long usually (estimate) do ALS patients survive once they are unable to walk?","Doctor":"Regardless of the part of the body first affected by the disease, muscle weakness and atrophy spread to other parts of the body as the disease progresses. Individuals have increasing problems with moving, swallowing, and speaking or forming words. Eventually people with ALS will not be able to stand or walk, get in or out of bed on their own, or use their hands and arms. In later stages of the disease, individuals have difficulty breathing as the muscles of the respiratory system weaken. Although ventilation support can ease problems with breathing and prolong survival, it does not affect the progression of ALS. Most people with ALS die from respiratory failure, usually within 3 to 5 years from the onset of symptoms. However, about 10 percent of those individuals with ALS survive for 10 or more years.Here I have given general idea on how the ALS condition progress and how much person can live once it is diagnosed. In your father case as per your explanation I understand he is already in a very weak condition. And not able to walk and move around means this will do cardio respiratory reconditioning and will make it further weak. As well the ALS it self will affect the respiratory muscles too. So at this stage till the time you keep him on ventilator and respiratory support as well patient maintain willing ness to live he will be able to live but this will not be for long time.Take care."},{"Patient":"my mom is 82 and had a bile bag for a week and then now they put a stint into the bile duct that had a couple of strictures. they have taken some cells from the bile duct and we will get the results tomorrow. my question is her hip bone; lower part of the hip; kind of the side of her leg on the opposite side of the incision made between ribs is really sore. Do you know why that would be?","Doctor":"Here its difficult to answer with out physical examination of patient but I can give you in general guideline.Since there is incision and inflamation at one side of her abdomen along with pain there will be muscle weakness also and due to that she might be sleeping on the other side with side lying as well while walking also there will be more weight on her normal side. Even when she will sit also she will give more weight on her normal side and due to that (due to overuse of normal side) as per her age it is common to have pain in normal side also with soreness in bones and soft tissues.I suggest to correct her posture and give her enough pillows to support her position in such a way where she Dont get constant weight at one perticular part of body. You can also practice this by changing her position frequently.As of now you can give her hot and cold pack alternately as per her tolerance limit to give some more relaxing effect on inflamed and sore areas of normal side.

The pain is subliminal and only when I have not used the shoulder for some time. It feels bony, hard and full. I do not know whether I should wait a little longer for an improvement or seek specialist attention. I have full movement without hindrance, BUT there is that bony, hard protrusion above the shoulder. I have not dared to use full strength on that shoulder and dare not use my bicycle on hills. I feel that there is not full strength but I have not tested it. Thank you for your help and generous attention. Affectionately Peter Kurz","Doctor":"Here it can be related with frozen shoulder or shoulder joint soft tissue damage, as well you also have mention about protrusion over the shoulder joint. I want to know this protrusion is recently started or its there from birth as well is it present even when your hand is down resting and there is no movement in shoulder joint. Or it comes only while moving your hand up with shoulder movement. If it is there from birth and even at resting position then its normal but if it comes only while moving hand up along with shoulder then its biomechanics of joint which is affected and so that you are feeling it as shoulder protrusion. Here one more symptoms you have given is bone tightness at shoulder. It can be due to less movement also. So the surrounding soft tissues have become tight.I suggest to visit ortho or physio doctor get it examine properly if needed they may ask for MRI scan. And based on diagnosis if there is mild to moderate issue that will get over with physio treatment and exercises suggestion. If there is major damage to soft tissue or joint capsule then you may need surgical correction and then again physiotherapy treatment for further healing and rehabilitation.You can also use hot and cold pack over your shoulder painful area for further pain relief.I am sure you will recover soon if you follow all above given steps.Take care."},{"Patient":"Help!

Fluid in the knee joint causes swelling with knee appearing larger than normal side.    i would recommend you to show it to a physcian and get your self examined. He may advised you to get x ray of the knee joint or ultrasound examination. If there is fluid in the knee joint than it will need needle aspiration. Also compression bandage should be applied so that swelling should not re develope.I hope this answer will be useful for you. Let me know if there is any other followup questions.thanks"},{"Patient":"Had an ACL reconstruction a week ago. I have gained twice in that weak and two days ago wake up with an enormous amount of pain in my calf on the leg that had surgey. Was told to get an ultra sound to rule out a blood clot. No clot was found but what s causing all this to happen?","Doctor":"Hello,I have studied your case. Pain and swelling in calf post ACL surgery is usually due to either a clot or it can be due to graft harvesting trauma. Some time it can also be due to tight knee brace or compression bandage.As you are saying that there is no clot on ultrasound examination so I would suggest you to make your compression bandage and knee brace little loose. Also there should be daily ice application on the knee and calf.You should meet with physio and do daily ankle pump exercises.   I hope these steps will be helpful in relieving this pain completely. If there is any further pain than you need to see your doctor.thanks"},{"Patient":"my wife fell down the stairs a while back and went to hospital and ended up on crutches for 6weeks and found that she factored her foot but now he metertasus is sticking out of her left foot, bearing in mind she didn t have a cast or a boot to support her foot","Doctor":"Hello,I have studied your case and I think that she needs to see a doctor as soon as possible. If she did not receive any plaster or splint than I think there can be two possibilities.1.There is no union of the fracture and that is why metatarsal is coming out of the skin.2.Bone is united but not in proper position so you are seeing such protrubarance. I would recommend you to get x ray of the foot and see what is happening. Accordingly we can treat this condition. I hope this answer will be useful for you.

Though he is not continuously informing about the pain in stomach but often he is reporting the same. We consulted the doctor he prescribed some antibiotic syrups. After a week to 10 days he suffered with nausea one time and motions some time. After explaining the situation to the doctor he suggested for blood and urine test and ultra scanning of abdomen. Blood tests are normal just the Hemoglobin percentage is less compare to actual. He has Hemoglobin as 10.4 only while actual normal has to be between 13.5-18.5 as per their report. But in the matter of T.W.B.C. he has 12900 cells/cu mm while actual should be between 4000-11000. It seems much than actual. Regarding ultra scanning report all the report is normal. But at the end of the report they mentioned Few enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes are noted in epigastrium and umbilical regions, largest one measuring 15x8 mm. They gave the impression as: Feature suggestive of mesenteric lymphadenopathy. *Suggested clinical correlation and further evaluation. After going through the report our regular doctor prescribed cyclopam for pain, zifi for cough/cold or as antibiotic. As we are not satisfied with the treatment of the doctor, I brought my son to another doctor where he given us lot of courage saying that this is the normal problem in children and it will be cured. He prescribed OFSIVITA, ENTEROGERMINA, Z & D, JUNIOR LANZOL, D-TUS FOR FIVE DAYS AND ADVISED TO STOP THE MEDICINE AFTER THE SAID PERIOD AND THE DISEASE WILL CURE ITS OWN. There is no fever, continuous motions, vomiting, night swet are noted in my son. But he is looking like too weak and not active than the previous days. He is playing but not with previous excitement. For the past few days we are trying to give liquid food to him. That may be one of the causes for his weakness. But his digestive power is too low since his birth. As on 15.01.2011 his weight is 11.3 kgs. In this regard, some people are scaring us that if we not take good treatment, this may be leads to different diseases such as TB, Cancer, etc. Sir, we are in too much tension. We are also not eating our food properly. This problem is from about 4 to 5 months we are facing. Recently a person by reading information which I put online, called me from Gujarat and he has a son of 5 years old having the same symptoms since 9 months. He informed that no Doctor is giving concurrent answer and he told that they are telling that this is normal infection which cures itself only within a few days or weeks or years. Till now I didn’t get my son for TB test and I am scared about the test to clarify my doubt that whether this problem is due to any cancer virus. We hope that you will help us in this regard for advising us as well as giving courage. Kindly suggest best cautions to be taken, medicine to be used, and the food to be given. We are in need of early reply sir. Thanking you, God may bless you. Muhammad Siddiq Bhimavaram W.G.
