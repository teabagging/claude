My blood pressure has been anywhere from 152/110 to as low as 138/92.  Should I go to the hospital?  I also have a horrible head ache","Doctor":"HelloThanks for posting here. I have gone through your complaints. Your BP recordings are definitely on the high side. High BP can lead to generalised discomfort, anxiety, headache and blurring of vision. Your left arm pain and headache is related to your blood pressure. Also since you say you woke up with the left arm pain, it may be due to incorrect posture while sleeping.In view of the above, we need to establish whether you really suffer from high BP. So we need three recordings one week apart (one recording every week for three weeks). If all the readings are persistently high then you must be started on treatment for high blood pressure. Also a lot depends on your age. If you are young then your arteries are still elastic and hence you can try diet modifications and exercise initially to treat your high blood pressure. Otherwise you should be started on medications.Wishing you good healthRegardsDr Shankar"},{"Patient":"i went to a urgent care because of a sudden eruption of lumps in my foot, he told me they are cysts..i take gabapentin for neuropathy ..i had compartment syndrome and emergency surgery last October..these are painful and peculiarly large and growing over a very short period of time... is there any other options besides surgery?","Doctor":"Respected user , hiThanks for using Healthcaremagic.comI have evaluated your query thoroughly .* Causes for the same include - recurrent infection - neurology related as  neurofibroma - others * Patient evaluation clinically with supportive biopsy evidences are vital to   assess the etiology and in depth perspects of recurrence * I strongly recommend to consult with high resolution clinical photograph    of the same for better insight Hope this clears your query Welcome for any further assistance Regards ."},{"Patient":"I have a small, tender lump in my abdominal wall just in the upper right quadrant of my abdomen.

Also, this may be benign lymph node growth such as lymphangioma. It is good that you have done tests Ct scan to rule out malignancy but I am not sure if you did ultrasound guided needle biopsy to verify exact pathology. I suggest to do this and if this is negative then you should consider surgical removal of the lymph node since if this presses surrounding tissue or causes discomfort then this is symptomatic and treatment is indicated even if this was not a malignancy.

The only sure-shot way is to get this ultrasound, FNAC and/or biopsy to confirm the cause of these lumps. Most important looks to be re-evaluation of the past cancer whether there is any recurrence and to get a confirmed diagnosis. Stress, anxiety and such mental conditions can cause the problems.

Your husband's blood pressure values are really high and some tests need to be done to investigate for the possible underlying causes: - a chest X ray study- a resting ECG- thyroid hormone levels for thyroid dysfunction- complete blood count for anemia- blood electrolytes for electrolyte imbalance-  blood gas analysis- fasting glucose for diabetes- kidney and liver function tests. If these tests result normal, a multi latency sleep test should be done to exclude possible sleep apnea. But, if no other underlying cause is found, I would recommend discussing with your doctor on the possibility of making some changes on his blood pressure therapy (raise the doses or add a new anti-hypertensive drug) in order to have a better control of his blood pressure values.

What, if anything, should I do about it? I have exercised on it since so it is not broken.","Doctor":"Dear user,When you get a hard enough blow, it causes blood to collect under the skin if there is no wound Hematoma, as we call it. That usually takes 4-6 weeks to go away, even after the redness is gone. it will usually change its colour from red to purplish to green and yellow before it completely fades away. If this continues to decrease in size, you don't really need to do anything. Just take pain killers and cold compressors as needed. If it becomes redder, or the swelling becomes more painful or increases in size, there are chances it has got infection. In that case you'll have to go your doctor to get it checked. In rare cases it needs operation to clean. There are very minimal chances that these kind of lumps persist after a few weeks, if it does persist though, you might need an x-ray to rule out small fracture, or any other kind of skin lump which you only happened to notice after the injury.Do write back if you need more help.Thanks"},{"Patient":"Hello, on the shaft of my penis, right below the head there is a small lump, about the size of a pin head.

I have made an appointment with the urologist however he can only see me on 23 February 2017.","Doctor":"Dear user,Thanks for your question. There may be a few possibilities1 Epididymal cyst. These are the small cysts (fluid-filled sacs) that can appear in the epididymis, usually cause no discomfort or pain. Usually, the doctor can diagnose it clinically, but sometimes an ultrasound may be needed to confirm the cyst. They are left alone if not infected, very big (which need needle aspiration of fluid in it), or painful. rarely they may need removal by operation if causing suspicion or trouble.2 Spermatocele: this is a cyst which feels like an epididymal cyst but it is filled with sperm (semen). Again managed conservatively most of the times.3 Varicocele: this is like varicose veins of the small veins next to one testicle (testis) or both testes. It is usually described as feeling like a 'wriggling bag of worms'. This is managed with surgery mostly, after preliminary investigations to see whats causing opressure on the testicluar veins. 4 Lipoma: this is a fatty lump which can sometimes cause difficulty because it can be felt separate from the testis, just like an epididymal cyst.So I suggest if it is soft and doesn't increase in size, you can wait for the appointment. Just keep an eye on it. Do write back if there are any more concerns.Thanks"},{"Patient":"My daughter tripped over a step and fell on her stomach with a whisk in her hand.

It is always advisable to take her to doctor regardless of the lump, to get her ribs examined, esp if she is in loads of pain.Hope it answered your query, do write back if anything else.

I have been sleeping a lot too.","Doctor":"Dear user,Thanks for the question. The lump you have described fits the description of a skin cyst, called Sebaceous Cyst. The first thing about them is they are non-cancerous. These happen because of ingrowing of hair with an excessive secretion of glands around it to raise the bump. So although they can occur on part of body, these are more likely to appear in the parts which are hairy and shaved. other sites could be face, neck, and torso.The contents which come out of it will be thickened and could have black in it because of the hair. it is less likely for an insect to embed in the skin, especially when there was no redness to suggest insect bite.Now that you have already emptied it, it might or might not collect again. If it does, you will need to get it removed. As if this cyst it recurrent or stays for long, there are chances that it gets infected.

In the meantime, extention of the knee is limited with about 5-6 degrees off from full extension and minor pain when walking downstairs. No signs of knee giving buckling.

This is possible BAkers cyst or some other dilatation of tendinous sheath or ligaments. it is not likely to be associated with meniscus.

Kinda hurts to pull on the skin piece thats hanging. Its like on the inside of my labia? Kind of near the hole. And when it ruptured it bled too. I put a warm rag on it, and it leaked with the clear discharge more. Its hard to describe exactly where it is, maybe its some infection? Idk. Might go to the doctor tomorrow hopefully. Please someone help give an idea as of to what this might be. I m Freaked out","Doctor":"HiThank you for asking HCM.I have gone through your query. The structure you see hanging can be part of hymen or vaginal polyp. If you send a close picture of it then it will be more helpful in identifying. It is better to have an examination with gynecologist to rule out this. Vaginal polyp is also benign and harmless. If it bothers you then it can be excised under local anaesthesia.Hope this may help you. Let me know if anything not clear.Thanks."},{"Patient":"I ve noticed every now and then the back of my head feels sore, like i hit it. When i go to touch the soar area there is a small bump. After about a day or two, it goes away. I ve noticed that when this does occur its usually around a time when I ve had alittle too much to drink. Do you think this is related to alcohol? I have had two falls to back of the head over the course of my life, nothing that took me to the hospital, but definately accidents that left a goose bump there for awhile. Do you think there s connection to that also?","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to Healthcaremagic. Thank you for your query. I am Dr. Rommstein and I will try to help you as much as I can.I dont htink this is related to alcohol since alcohol cant affect soft tissues on this way. It may be related to the hit if this was at this area and then so called traumatic fibroma may occur. However it sounds to me more like some subcutaneous lipoma or atheroma and you should see surgeon for further evaluation or you can do ultrasound with needle biopsy. In every case it doesnt sound serious to me.I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us.Kindly regards.

I am getting bad heartburn, and my neck does hurt due to when they took out one of the tumors it had taken up residence on my C3-5 and in to my esophagus.

Now it suddenly turned black (like a tiny watermelon seed) and VERY VERY loose- it doesn t look like it s a tumor or an infection (Because still no pain and looks nothing like the pictures provided on google) and I m guessing it turned black because blood circulation was cut off from it.

In December I had received a Hair cut and noticed There were 3 bald spots were I thought to be 3 boiils. The bald spots did not seem normal so I went to health services. I was able to see a Doctor a little more than a month later. The main spot had grown in size and had been draining puss and other fluid as well as blood. The doctor had taken a culture to test for MRSA. He had drained it and reported it looked like cottage cheese comming out. I was placed on a anti-biotic called Sulfa-meth tri-meth, for ten days. The MRSA test came back as negative and I was told that It came backs as coagulis negative staphaloccus. In march of 2010 I had 2 drains placed in the back of my head for proximetly 24 hours. It was then deemed I should need surgery to remove any mass that had been built up under the skin. By this time the spot was huge draining everyday but never getting smaller. I had surgery and underwent a general anesthesia. I was placed in an infirmary for 7 weeks where they were to do a wet to dry healing for the surgery. The wound never officially healed it is now October and coming upon one year from when the problem first started. I constanly have small bumps fill with fluid and puss around the region of the wound and when pressed upon or sometimes when I do not press them even it drains Blood and sometimes a snotty red mass that comes out of the surgery wound area. I do not have Insurance and I tried to clean it with peroxide on a daily basis but This does not seem to help either. I have had a MRSA test as recently as Aug. 2010 and the results were negative.

Originally it was diagnosed as a groin strain and further investigations and a MRI scan showed it to be on my pubic tubicle of aprox 2.5 cm and probably as a result of repetitive aducter exercises. I was told it may get bigger.

What is the likely hood that this is something sinister and is there a quick blood test to show if it is rather than further scans etc","Doctor":"x-ray and serial MRI will show its progress. Any way you should remain in touch with your orthopaedic surgeon."},{"Patient":"I noticed a lump in my neck after my son was born (August ’09), and didn’t think much of it since pregnancy hormones can do weird things to your body, until it didn’t go away after a few months. I saw my PCP in May of ’10 and she drew labs and sent me for an ultrasound of my thyroid. The labs came back: TSH 2.299, Free T4 0.90. The u/s showed two complex right thyroid nodules, the larger measuring 2.8x1.5x1.7cm. The left lobe contaning a tiny hypoechoic region measuring 0.3x0.1x0.2cm. The isthmus had a left sided nodule measuring 0.4x0.2cm. She then sent me to have a biopsy, which was done also in May ’10 which was read: “Clinical History: 2.8cm solild/cystic nodule, right thyroid. Smears are of low overall cellularity. They show scattered groups of benign follicular epithelial cells and numerous histiocytes dispersed in a background of cyst fluid and colloid. No features of malignancy are identified. Consistent with a benign thyroid nodule with cystic change.”. I then saw an endocrinologist who basically said let’s follow up with an ultrasound in 6 months. Then the last few months I started noticing that I could feel the nodule when I swallow, and can even notice that it’s there when I’m not doing anything (just feels like I’ve got a lump in my throat), and sometimes feels like it’s hard to swallow. So, I found a new MD (I moved) and he rechecked my labs and ordered another u/s (all in July ’11). Labs came back: TSH 3.35, Free T4 1.0, TPO Antibody 35.1, Anti thyroglobulin 424.1. The u/s report describes a 2.8x1.9x1.6cm mixed ecogenicity mass in the right thyroid with cystic and solid components which probably represents a necrotic nodule. Also seen another cystic appearing 9x7x4mm nodule in the lower right lobe. A 2mm cystic nodule is seen in the left lobe. The other issue – I think I have some hypothyroid symptoms (and yes, I know my levels don’t show hypothyroid). - Family history of thyroid issues – both maternal grandparents had thyroid problems (one had thyroid cancer) - Unable to lose weight despite diet (same diet as 2 years ago when I was able to lose 35 lbs – I gained much of that weight back) - Constipation - Always tired (I realize I also have a 2 year old at home) - Aching joints and stiffness - Low mood/depression (not interested in doing a lot of things) - No libido - Memory is not as sharp as it was a few years ago (forgetful, having trouble finding words at times) - Dry eyes I told my new MD that I thought I had hypothyroid symptoms (not this list, just in general) and he said he didn’t want to treat because my labs were normal and he didn’t want to make my hyperthyroid. He has referred me to an endocrinologist, who I saw yesterday. I feel like he completely blew me off - didn t want to listen and said I just had thyroid cysts and we should follow up again in 6 months with labs and a visit. Am I just being paranoid, or is something going on with me that is being ignored?","Doctor":"Yes, of course, your symptoms are of hypothyroidism although your thyroid profile is normal. For the time being take low doses of l-thyroxine( eltroxine 25 mg). Ultimately go for surgery of thyroid."},{"Patient":"I have a lump in my abdomen that is approximately 1 inch long. It is too the right of my belly button. it has been there for about two years now and sometimes it looks like it has edema around it. It is bean shape, movable and painless.

I now noticed about a week ago that I have a similar lump on the side of my neck. I have always had a palpable pulsating lump in my upper neck that comes and goes, But this one is below it. I feel like sometimes it is difficult to swallow, ear fills full and that side of my face feels numb. Also over the last few weeks there are times that my vision gets blurry and I feel as though I am going to faint. I was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis about two years ago. Over the last year I have gain almost 30 pounds and cant get it off. I have never had a weight issue.

I can still feel it there. Recently I had something like that on my eyelid. It was definitely there. I could see it, (a tiny flesh-colored roundish lump on my eyelid). But now it is gone. What is this? I have had actinic keratosis before. Is this related? My skin is fairly light colored.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. The description of the lumps you have given does fit in the description of the actinic keratosis so the possibility cannot be denied. However, confirmation of the diagnosis is essential as actinic keratosis is closely related with development of skin cancer. I would advise you to visit a dermatologist or oral & maxillofacial surgeon or plastic surgeon for physical examination of the lumps. Physical examination plays a major role in the diagnosis of this disorder. In addition, you might need to go for a biopsy as cell type can be confirmed only under microscope. Based on the test results, diagnosis can be made and treatment can be decided. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

As time went on, upon waking my lips were crusty and I had to apply chap stick frequently during the morning to lubricate them. Then my lips got redder than normal and eventually I had a rash on them. Understanding that it was likely an allergic reaction, I started eliminating things I thought may have been the problem. Finally, I was reduced to visiting my family physician who prescribed steroids to get rid of the rash. In the meantime, I took my daughter to see the same doctor for a sinus infection. Since I was there anyway, I told my doctor that at the same time my lips were getting better, so was the edema in my legs. He stated that with the elimination of inflammation I was able to eliminate the swelling as well. I had skinny ankles again and was not sure why the steroids had caused the change. My legs and ankles had been swelling each day to about twice normal size up to that point. They called me from his office the next week after my original visit to tell me that the results of blood tests taken at the previous visit showed that my TSH was low. Low thyroid, and I was losing weight, how could that be? I was also asked if there was something that I was routinely taking that would cause the allergic reaction I had experienced. As I was telling my husband about what they asked he remembered that he read on the paperwork that comes with my new bp medication that it could cause thyroid problems. Ok, so my next step was to ask the pharmacy for a copy of that information. Indeed all that symptoms I was having were likely caused by the new medication. Not good news at all in my opinion. I quit taking it immediately, and took the paper to my doctor. Now, for the question. I also am experiencing a lump on the inside of my left shin bone. this lump is about two inches in length and one inch wide.

Long story sorry. 2 years ago I started having ache in my left breast - Nurse practitioner said a swollen lymph node. Then my shoulder (front) started aching, then it went to arm. A knot appeared in the elbow (inside), then tingling to fingers, with occasional tightness in chest, ache in collarbone and back of shoulder even up back of neck. I had EKG and it was fine, blood work (CBC) it was fine, mamo was fine, ultrasound of elbow didn t even show the knot, ultrasound of heart and aorta was fine, MRI of shoulder showed some tendenosis, but that s all. A nerve test of arm was fine. Symptoms started diminishing. My breast still gets sore some and raising my arm high will pull at it. Then a year and half ago I had ACL reconstruction. A week ago, I had to have orthoscopic surgery to take out scar tissue and fix it. I could not get it straight and it was getting worse. I was walking with a limp. About 3 months before that I started headaches almost daily and almost always on the left side. Then I started having a pain in my left jaw. I could not open it wide enough to even bite a cupcake. That lasted a week, then I got what seemed like a cold. I coughed up phlem and some mixed in blood. It went on for 14 days, by the end it was mostly clear and some bit foamy. I took Amoxacillin for 10 days. Cough went away, but jaw still hurt. I took it for 7 more days. No change and now my arm (left) was hurting again. My blood pressure was 126/?70. It is usually 112-116. I had struggles at work and it was a week before my 2nd ACL surgery. My dr. thought it may be stress. She said she felt no swollen nodes. They told me to take Cymbolta. I took it for 2 days. We had to go to Fl. for a funeral, I forgot to take it on day 3. My arm seemed fine and no change in my jaw so I quit. 4 days later was that 2nd surgery. I had IV fluids and antibiotic. 4 days later, my jaw still sore and a sore on my gum, my tonge thick and white, my throat very red, white patches on my inside jaw and then a day later teeth achy. Dr. said sorta looked like thrush, but not as fussy. Ordered oral nystatin 4 times a day. Dentist said thought it was thrush. Dentist took panoramic x-ray. No absess, no lessions, jaw joints look good. Said probably stress. I had had some episodes of lightheadedness too - especially when looking down. Then some pressure in back of neck. Woke up with throat tightness one day. Went to ENT 2 days later after dentist. Hearing test ok, eardrums ok. He felt my throat, felt my jaw, looked in my mouth and said yes thrush, dry tongue, and probably stress - said to call dentist and get mouth guard for night. He said the muscle runs down throat and can cause a tightness. I have also had a tender spot on an off on the forehead left side and the right temple area. I was doing great today 1 day later and feeling good until as I was cooking dinner, my left arm started aching again and then a pressure in my back of my neck then head feeling heavy and large then tightness in my throat. I could breathe fine, but it felt tight. About half hour the tightness subsided, but arm still ached and in front of shoulder hurt. That lasted for about another hour. Then ache went away I felt good for about 10 minutes and the tightness in throat started back with some pressure on and off in sinus to nose. Mostly left side. Still breathing ok. A few burps which were hard to get out. Like something wouldn t let the air out easy. I can swallow, but it feels like a blob in there. I am so concerned. I have 2 little kids and I worry something really serious is being missed that needs taken care of now. Please help. I don t know where to turn or what to do.

She sounded my chest and told me she could hear a heart murmur- this is the first time any doctor ever picked up on this. I am wondering could the 2 be correlated? Thanks","Doctor":"Hi! Thanks for sharing your concern with us. I read carefully what you said, and my answer is: Yes, the heart murmur your doctor heard could be due to the tonsillitis infection that you had. From your description that the tonsils were enlarged and covered by pus and with swollen neck lymph nodes, it is very likely that you had an infection from group A Streptococcus. This infection damages con also damage the valves of the heart, and this is the reason of the heart murmur heard. I would recommend you, that  you finish all your treatment with penicillin until the end. Even though you might feel better and have no tonsillitis symptoms any more, it is very important to complete the full treatment for preventing further complications (such might be the post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). i wish you get better soon!

CT shows it to be 10x15cm with fatty stranding, not well defined, no fluid, nodules or mass, unremarkable lymph nodes and no bone involvement. We are awaiting an appt to see a surgeon for biopsy. My brother was recently diagnosed with a liposarcoma on his spermatic cord so that is where my mind keeps going. Any input or ideas would be much appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for the question.Upper back region is a very common site of a benign lipomatous tumour called Lipoma. It ususally occurs around the middle age and presents with radiological features similar to your case and CURABLE by surgery alone.However, it can only be confirmed by a biopsy(needle or open) or cytology. In my opinion as a Pathologist,A Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC )OR a Incisional Biopsy both can confirm the true nature of your husband's lump. It is mandatory and essential for categorization and treatment.Though you did not mention the duration of the lump your husband is suffering from and I suspect it is a long time(months). If that is the case, it emphasises the presence of a benign lesion like lipoma.In conclusion, I would like to mention that, FNAC is a much faster and day care procedure which can alleviate your mental tension quickly. The only downside is you have to go for a biopsy ultimately if it fails or not done and reported by a person who is experienced and familiar with the procedure.Hope this helps.Feel free to contact again for any other question."},{"Patient":"I have a bone-like lump below only my right knee cap.

It was really painful at the time and it bruised, the bruising is gone now but i am left with a really hard mini egg size lump, that is painful is pushed. I am concerned about what it may be.","Doctor":"Thank you for asking your question. My name is Dr Marcucci and I will try to help you out with your question. This lump could be a number of differ things but from what you explained it sounds like it could be a deeper contusion or an abscess, or a foreign object like a piece or part of the hip replacement components.Deeper contusion is related to the trauma you recently had and in the healing process the visible swelling and bruising has healed but the remaining deeper contusion often remains longer and heals at a much slower rate. You can ice this area. An abscess can form from an infectious process. this occurs when the body recognizes some infection or a foreign material in the body. The defense system in our body works quickly to wall the area off to prevent it from spreading to the rest of the body and once walled of an abscess can form and pus develops within the abscess. the treatment for abscess often include an incision and draining the pus and often requires antibiotics as well. If a piece or a part of the hip replacement became loose or broke off you could also suffer the symptoms you mentioned. if this is the case you would need to see a doctor for X-rays and then possible removal of the piece or part and repair of the hip replacement. Hopefully this information helps you with your situation. Ultimately you may require further investigation by a physician that examines you in person. Thanks again for your question and be well and healthy. sincerely,Dr. Jared Marcucci MD"},{"Patient":"I have a working out related question.

After each shower, the carpet will feel damp. Few days later, a smell of mold (spores) became very strong. That s when the lump appeared.

It is wonderful that golf ball is not so small that someone can feel and a Doctor is not sure about it.

There is a simple 7 mm cystic area at the inferior margin of this. The right ovary appears more lobulated than what was seen before.

Let us have a look upon the differential features of these problems:1. A sebaceous cyst is movable, painful only in case of infection and it has a blck spot, the punctum. 2. Dermoid cyst - A painless movable swelling situated in midline in the body.3. Lymph node - It is always secondary to an infection in area.4. Lipoma - Fat tumour and these are usually multiple. In my opinion, you may be suffering from either lipoma or a cyst. Both of these conditions are harmless. But medical examination is necessary. Signs are usually sufficient to diagnose but for further confirmation, a fine needle aspiration fluid examination may be carried out.

I do plan on going to the hospital tomorrow night (I d go tonight, but I have to work early tomorrow morning), so I will talk to a doctor in person & have them check it out, but I just wanted to get an idea of what s going on.","Doctor":"hi.it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general or an ENT surgeon, for medical and physical examination. two things to consider primarily based from your description: 1. a possible cervical lymphadenopathy (inflamed lymph node) probably secondary to a recent upper respiratory tract infection 2. a possible lesion of thyroid or salivary gland in origin. other considerations may be fibroma, lipoma or cyst.. clinical examination from your doctor will be of great help. further diagnostic examination such as neck ultrasound, ct-scan or x-ray, thyroid function tests and tissue biopsy will be recommended as needed. malignancy and other tumor types must be ruled-out. subsequent management (medical and/or surgical if indications are found) will be directed accordingly.hope this helps.good day!!~dr.kaye"},{"Patient":"I got hit in the head, left side at hairline - huge goose egg.

I appears to be lipoma, which is a collection of fat under the skin. Simple tests like it is mobile, skin can be pinched over it, helps in diagnosis. However you need to go to general surgeon, who after examination will establish his diagnosis. Treatment of this simple condition is excision under local anaesthesia. Other differential diagnosis can be sebaceous cyst, some muscular growth or hematoma etc. In difficult cases Ultrasonography of the lump can lead us to diagnoses.

Losartan takes a few hours to start acting, it dos not act immediately after use. I do not know how long have you been taking losartan? It needs at least 3-4 weeks to reach the maximal effect. In addition to your question, I would say that during physical activity the  blood pressure is slightly increased, but of course it matters also what type of exercise you do and how much your heart rate goes under training. You should monitor your heart rate during training.

Currently, my weight is about 420 (and hopefully will continue to reduce!). This cyst has gotten bigger. About a year ago, I consulted w/ a surgeon to see about getting it removed. He didn t think it was cancer, but said it should come off. The appointment was made, but before I could get it done, I lost my insurance. Now, it is a little bit bigger ( I refer to it as my tail ) and developed a raw spot and started to bleed. Hubby patches me up and I m ok. However, it has bled again at least 4 times. Each time, we get it to stop, use nuskin spray and gauze pads and tape. I can t keep doing this forever, but I m w/out insurance and we ve already got a ton of credit card debt we re dealing with. (BTW, we make too much for public assistance). Could it be cancer? A girl I met online said she had the same thing happen to her, but hers was something that happens in less than 5% of PREGNANT women. As far as I know, I am not pregnant. Help! I am very worried. Thank you for your help.","Doctor":"hi.it is best that you go back to your doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for clinical evaluation, especially if you notice it to be increasing in size and is bleeding. it could be a simple cyst (keratinous or sebaceous type), but other tumor lesions must also be ruled-out. diagnostics, such as imaging and a possible biopsy, may be recommended. management (medical and/or surgical) will be directed accordingly.hope this helps.good day!!~dr.kaye"},{"Patient":"my uncle s daughter is 3 and she suffers from neck lumps quite often. she already went 5-6 times surgery to get it removed. it get resolves that time but again get occurs inside the neck. what could be the root cause and what is the best medication for that . kindly help.

As per your query you have lump formation on lips which is due to punched injury. Need not to panic about it. This is normal mechanism of healing as collagen tissue is getting formed and it will take around 3-4 weeks for granulation tissue to form incompletely. Maintain proper oral hygiene.

Can you please give details about this method and how far it is successful as an alternative to bypass surgery. Thank you very much. P. Srinivasulu / INDIA.","Doctor":"hello  thank you for posting here. i have gone through your description. Since he has two blocks in the heart arteries and he is adviced bypass, the right choice is to go ahead with bypass surgery. I dont know any therapy named KEELEY, but i suppose you are talking about chelation therapy. this therapy is of no benefit for the patient. The blocks in the heart artery are embedded inside the heart vessel and any amount of medication or therapy cannot decrease it to make it vanish. Medications can only help to stop progression of the block. definitive way to treat critical heart blockages is an angioplasty or bypass surgery. Had you been my patient my advice would be to go ahead with bypass. Bypass surgery requires a stay of 7- 10 days approx in the hospital. patient can start walking usually by day 5 after surgery. It requires a recovery period of 20 -25 days but the long term results of bypass are very good with patients having a good quality of life. gastric ulcers can be treated with long term antacids. Gastric ulcers are not a contraindication for surgery. wishing you good healththank you"},{"Patient":"I have these bumps down near my genitals, they aren t warts because I ve been tested and am 100% clean and they aren t inside my genitals either.

You have to be on atleast the following medications: blood thinner medications like aspirin 150 mg, a cholesterol lowering medications rosuvastatin 20 mg. Other medications may be added according to your symptoms and examination. coralan can be continued. Also you need to do an EKG, 2 D ECHO, and if both are normal then a treadmill test. for the pain in joints we have to evaluate you for arthritis. so do a CBC, serum uric acid levels and RA factor. You will probably get the answer to your sufferings by these tests. If not further workup can be done. But as of now the above tests are enough. Also avoid red meat and alcohol for the time being. thank you"},{"Patient":"I ve had this red bump on my leg for quite awhile now and doesn t seem to be getting any better.

WHY IS IT THERE PLEASE HELP!!!","Doctor":"Hi..Welcome to HEALTHCARE MAGIC..I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns..As per your complain a dark purple lump next to molar tooth can be due to a dialated vein also known as Varicose vein or a Varux..The lump might be due to formation of a small blood clot that got lodged in that area forming a Thrombus..It is not aa serious condition and will not cause any serious problem..It can gradually reduce in size on its own..If it is not ruled out as the cause other causes can be like mucous cyst or Mucocele, Hematoma or a Hemangioma..Confirmation can be done by getting a clinical evaluation done by an Oral Physician or an Oral Surgeon..

It s the size of a pin head and looks a little like a tiny bloody blister but not painful at all just annoying and I keep touching it with my tongue. What could this be? When I looked at it closely I also noticed 2 small clear blisters on my lip also. They do not look like cold sores to me. I am a smoker. Thoughts","Doctor":"Hi Dear,Welcome to HCM.Understanding your concern. As per your query red bump on inside of lip in query is due to  traumatic injury to inner lip leading to accumulation of blood. It could be mucocele leading to  accumulation of saliva in clogged duct of salivary gland. I would suggest you to consult oral physician for proper examination and to rule out other causes like hematoma , cold sore or herpes. This is usually harmless  . It usually go away few days without any treatment. If it persist then there are many treatment options available. Doctor may give incision and remove it under the local anesthesia. Doctor may give antibiotics to subside it. For now maintain oral hygiene , do listerine mouth wash rinses and give cold compresses .Hope your concern has been resolved.Get Well Soon.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"So my name is Kat and I m 18 and about a year ago I noticed a lump of some kind under my chin near my neck. It doesn t hurt but I can pop it in and out and sometimes it feels funny if I leave it alone. I m concerned because I m having it again. It never went away, it just stopped popping out as much. I asked my doctor but she didn t really pay attention to it and said it was nothing. I don t feel like it s nothing. Any advice?","Doctor":"Hi..Welcome to HEALTHCARE MAGIC..I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns..As per your complain a lump under the chin can be due to 2 causes:1.It can be a swollen lymph node caused due to infection in the head and neck region..2. It can be swollen submental salivary gland and can be caused due to either clogged duct of the salivary gland or due to infection in the gland..Confirmation can be done by consulting an Oral Physician and an Ultrasound or MRI can help in confirming the diagnosis and proper treatment can be planned accordingly..In case if it is swollen lymph node a biopsy can be taken to rule out th exact cause of swelling and in case of infections antibiotics can help.Clogging of the salivary gland duct can be relieved by removing the obstruction that are the crystalline stones formed in the ducts of the salivary gland from minerals present in saliva and removal of the stones either manually if located superficially or surgically if present deep can be done..In case of infection antibiotics can relieve..Hope this information helps..Thanks and regards.Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora."},{"Patient":"have a lump on my calf swelling behind knee. just had mri done no result yet they thought 2 fatty cyst or bakers cyst. anyway its been a week and now the ankle of my other right side has stinging in it.

Should I worry about the 230?","Doctor":"hello thanks for posting here. A heart rate of 230 on exertion definitely requires evaluation. however first of all we need to evaluate whether you really reach that 230 reading. while running the heart rate detector may mistake your body vibrations and movements for heart beats and count them  accordingly. hence the heart rate may erroneously show a high reading. So you have to check whethrr it happens with you only or with everyone. Another thing that can be done is a treadmill test. It requires you to run on a treadmill, the speed of which increases gradually to a point till your heart rate reaches a target rate. this TMT test will continuously record your EKG while you are running so all aberrations and errors can be rules out. It will definitely show whether you really have a fast heart rate on exercising. If it documents very fast heart rate further work up can be done. wishing yoi good health. thank you"},{"Patient":"I am a female and i have a swollen lump right above the crease from my left thigh and pelvic bone that I noticed earlier today that has grown from the size of a peanut to the size of a golf ball, also my right upper arm also started hurting almost as if i got a tetanus shot but worse, a few hours after the lump appeared, i can hardly lift my arm it hurts so bad and i have been nauseas and have had diharria, which my bowel movements haven't been normal for about 3 months.","Doctor":"Hi, dearI have gone through your question.

I did not think of asking her about drinking regular tea.  Can I still drink tea and cola etc?  Aslo, just to let you know she said my blood pressure was excellent. Thanks Sue","Doctor":"Hi Sue! Beverages that contain caffeine are  known to have an impact in the heart rate, mainly causing sinus tachycardia. Coffee and all drinks containing caffeine (including coca-cola) are stimulants of the heartbeat. Regarding your question, some types of tea contain low levels of caffeine (black tea, green tea, etc ). There are also some herbal tea that do not contain caffeine at all, such as camomille, ginger tea, peppermint tea etc. I would recommend the use of tea, especially herbal tea. In my opinion and experience, you can also use green or black tea, but since they have low amounts of caffeine you should not exagerate with the frequency of use during the day. In terms of cola, I would advise that you don't use it, since it contains considerable amount of caffeine. I hope my advices would be helpful to you. Take care and thanks for sharing your concern with us.Regards,Dr. P.Cerri"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...

Few days ago he had a slight chest pain and had a very light sweat...so immediately he got chest pain medication from his brother and had 1 tablet and he was okay after that . He went to the doctor the very next day and took ECG and the result was normal. Still the doctor recommended isordil and also a stress-ECG(treadmill test). The test showed some abnormalities. IS it possible to have a normal ECG and an abnormal Stress test ?","Doctor":"Hi!Yes, it is possible that a normal ECG is followed by an abnormal stress test. The ECG done when the person is at rest, does not always show the problem of coronary heart disease. This is because while resting, the heart gets the amount of blood and oxygen that it needs to work. That is why, when there has been a typical chest pain and the ECG at rest was normal, the doctor recommends a stress test-ECG. During this stress, the heart job increases and the amount of blood and oxygen that it needs are doubled. In a healthy person, the heart work and the amount of blood and oxygen that it needs are in balance, while in coronary heart disease they are disbalanced (stress test shows abnormalities). I tried to explain why it can happen to have a normal ECG and an abnormal stress test-ECG. I hope to have been clear enough for you.I wish your father gets better soon!

PSVT is basically short circuiting of the electrical system of the heart.This is a benign condition that can be easily treated but before that we have to be sure about the diagnosis.Now for diagnosis, we need an ECG done during palpitations but as the duration of your husband's palpitations is quite short so I donot feel that it can be done.The other way is EPS (Electrophysiological studies) which is an invasive method where in we introduce catheters inside heart and then try to induce the palpitations. When diagnosed, we can ablate the abnormal electrical pathways so that no short circuiting occur again. All of this procedure is done with catheters that can be passed from one of your groin just like the angiography is done.BUT before all this, I would like him to get his thyroid function tests to rule out any thyroid abnormality and echocardiography done to be sure that his heart is structurally normal.Hope you get your answers and all the best."},{"Patient":"I have a lump  on the side of my face, in front of my ear lobe.

The probable reasons are:Exaggerated response of the body to a stimulus and this looks physiological as the bumps disappear within few minutes.Another reasons can be very sensitive histamine response of the body which the body takes care of immediately.Another possibility is that there was exposure to some allergens in the past which have caused this sort of hypersensitive response. I would advise you to undergo the tests of blood, urine and stool.Get a clinical evaluation, examination and investigations as may be decided by your Doctor.Special tests may be needed.

I also know that I get skipped heart beats. I also understand that heart burn can sometimes cause skipped beats. I sometimes go through a short period of occasional palpitations that are felt in the lower chest slightly to the right. When I check my pulse, I find that sometimes the palpitations have a skipped beat and other times not. The skipped beats are usually associated with the palpitations when I am under some sort of stress like excersizing or after eating a heavy meal. Could this palpitation be an esophogal spasm? I sure seems stomach related but feels like a skipped heart beat.","Doctor":"Hello! I understand your concern. In terms of skipped heart beats (that you say you know), I hope you have confirmed through examination and consultation with a cardiologist. If you have not confirmed I would recommend you to do some examination. First an ECG, second an echocardiografy to see the cardiac function, and finally a 24 h Holter cardiac rhythm to monitor your rhythm. For the problems with hiatal hernia and heart burn (gastroesophgal reflux) you need to do fibrogastroscopy and X-ray with contrast. Sometimes the skipping heart beat can be felt as spasms of the esophagus.In conclusion, I would like to say that it is better if you confirm the skipped heart beats and their nature, and get the appropriate treatment in case it will be needed and after consultation with a cardiologist. My recommandation is that you be careful with your meals because heavy meals are a known factor to ​​trigger skipped heart beats. Also heavy meals worsen your heart burn.

As per your query you have symptoms of  lump on throat and ear pain which is mainly after smoking is because of chronic pharyngitis. Due to long standing history of smoking your throat got infected leading to tonsillitis and pharyngitis. I would suggest you not to worry about it as it is not a very alarming situation. Visit ENT specialist once and get it examined if you feel any pain or discomfort. Till then gargle with hot water and salt mixed in that. Take antibiotic such as Azithromycin along with decongestants. Ear  pain is due to pressure build up in that area. It will relieve soon once infection subsides. Take diet rich in multivitamins.Hope your concern has been resolved.Get Well soon.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

Recently my throat and neck have been feeling weird, kinda like its swollen.  I had strep and was on antibiotics and didn't smoke and started to feel better but than my glands and tonsuls were still swollen and they put me on a general really strong antibiotic.  After finishing my medication i waited a while before i smoked again and now that feeling of a lump in the my throat is back.  What is it?","Doctor":"Hi,I can understand your problem.Your feeling of uneasiness could be due to recurrent episodes of pharyngitis which is directly related to smoking.You have to quit or avoid smoking for long time.You can also start doing gargles 3-4 times a day and start some anti allergic drug.Thanks"},{"Patient":"Late last year, I began having symptoms of dysphagia with my reflux, which over the months escalated to a lump in my throat and slow-moving food. I went to a GI in early March and he performed an esophagoscopy. Results showed a small hiatal hernia and small Schatzki's ring. He dilated the ring and said most of my symptoms were probably due to anxiety and stress. I was taking 15mg Prevacid once a day and that seemed to help, but after a while I started to feel a pressure in my head and throat and intense anxiety. I stopped taking Prevacid a few weeks ago and the pressure went away and anxiety subsided. I now take Pepcid once a day, which helps the reflux. However, over the passed few weeks I have felt a soreness in my chest cavity after I eat. It almost feels like a pulled muscle and sometimes a slight burning. Upon physical examination, I discovered the soreness is around the chest cavity and also just below under the ribs. I think the discomfort is in my esophagus. I also notice that when I eat a lot of simple carbs and starch or greasy foods, the food seems to move slower down my esophagus. My diet has been altered to eat better foods such as whole grains and complex carbs, lots of veggies and foods with fiber and protein. I'm also trying to eat slower and take smaller bites. However, I'm still having discomfort after having a day of heavy foods, like an Easter meal. Could I possibly having muscle spasms in my esophagus? Could it be the Schatzki's ring constricting? Or is there something more serious? Should I be concerned? I can't keep going back to the doctor for more tests or to have him tell me its just anxiety.","Doctor":"Hi,I can understand your problem.To me it is due to severe GERD. Schatzki ring can cause difficulty swallowing and some time require repeat dilatation.You have to take antacids like PPIs regularly for long duration.You can also start taking antacids like H-2 blockers at bed time. Please avoid heavy meal,alcohol,smoking and fatty foods.Thanks"},{"Patient":".2 pegs a week i didnt take medication for HBP..cause i didnt like it my question is do i have hypertension or HPB because i always went to doc to get it checked next day after drinking heavily..please hlep me i am confused and i have quit smoking too..can my blood pressure get back to normal without medications???","Doctor":"I do not know how much are your blood pressure values ​​and what values ​​you consider high?

I asked my husband to see if it was a pimple and if so, could he pop it for me. He looked at it, told me that it was a small raise red dot and he didn't think it was a pimple but did squeeze it a few times to see if anything came out. Nothing. A week later, I noticed that it had gotten larger (again, not really being able to see it), my husband said that maybe it was a pimple after all because it looked like one but didn't have a visible head. He squeezed it a few more times and then pricked it with a sterile needle. blood came oozing out but no puss. he didn't squeeze it again, but had to put pressure on it for at least 20 min and even then, I had to put a bandaid on it because it was still bleeding. Over the next few days, it got larger and larger. What my husband said was once a small red dot the size of pea maybe, and raised above the service, was now at least 1/8 inch high and about the size of a penny. It started to scab over, so I left it alone. Until one day, I was laying on our leather couches, and my skin was stuck to it and when I went to get up, I immediately felt dripping down my back. It took almost 1/2 hour to stop the bleeding that time. When I went to the couch,(sorry for the grossness), stuck to the couch was a big ole' scab. Crusty with edges especially dry. This happened one other time, when I forgot, and scratched by back really hard. I know have what looks like a blood blister, but it starting to get crusty, especially the edges, which are pulling away from my skin and are completely hardened.

Any ideas? Oh I m 24 and female with endometriosis, couldn t be that could it?!","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for the query.This lump is most likely a blood collection called hematoma. Due to the injury, veins have been ruptured so the blood has appeared in the soft tissues. Large hematoma wont disappear by its own. As the blood contains glucose, bacteria can easily grow in it. This makes any hematoma prone to infection. Sooner or later, hematoma will turn into an abscess.That is why I suggest you to consult general surgeon. Sift tissues ultrasound should be done and hematoma drained.Hope this will help. Regards."},{"Patient":"My 16 year old daughter has a mass on the back of her shoulder.

It has a quite fast pace, but it sometimes stops for like 1 second, and then it occurs one big pump, and returns to it's pace.

What can this be?","Doctor":"hello thanks for posting here. since you feel that your heart beats are irregular with intermittent pauses, i advice you a holter monitoring which records a 24 hr EKG. It is attached to your body and you go home with the machine, do your acitivites as usual and return next day. the machine downloads all the EKG recordings for the last 24 hrs. It can tell you whether you have these irregular or missed beats, their frequency, type and whether they are harmful. on basis of the above if you have irregularities in heart beats, you can be started on treatment if required. otherwise if the test doesnt show any irregularities,you need not worry. thank you"},{"Patient":"Hi, I had a bump on my scrotum about two months ago.

The swelling goes down a little if i put ice on it. Its not an open sore just a lump that wont go away. Ive had it for about 5 days now","Doctor":"Hi Dear,Welcome to HCM.Understanding your concern.As per your query swollen lump above upper lips is mainly due to lip biting. Accidentally teeth of lower jaw strike upper lip and cause bump in that area due to excessive accumulation of collagen fibers in that area. It could be due to herpes simplex virus infection which can cause cold sore in that area. If you have excessive sun exposure then this blister could be because of that. Need not to panic about it. Take ice cubes and press on this area for 10-12 mins off and on. Keep area rehydrated with lip moisturizing creams. Keep drinking plenty of water. Apply honey on this area for faster relief.Take multivitamin tablet to booster immunity. Avoid sharp, hot and spicy food substances as it will exaggerate symptoms. Your symptoms will resolve with in 3-4 days. You should consult a physician who can do a proper clinical check up and laboratory investigations and if herpes is diagnosed oral and topical antiviral medications like Acyclovir, Valacyclovir.Hope your concern has been resolved.Get Well Soon.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"Hello I am 31 years old and for the last 6 months I have been getting swollen lymph nodes under my armpits no injuries no cuts from shaving and I have been fine no sickness I went to the Drs a month ago and they told me that I had a lump just above my breast tissue and not to worry but I don t understand why my lymph nodes keep swelling up and becoming hard","Doctor":"Lymphnodes in axillary region (as a matter,,anywhere) mostly get enlarged and become palpable (toucheable) to our hands....mostly due to  a primary source of infection nearby....in ur case it cud be infection within breast tissue or upper limb.....but however the problem becomes bigger if they appear...\\"hard\\" or continuously enlarging and are multiple on both sides(armpits)...and in other regions like neck and groin regions......In these situations....a malignancy(cancer) arising within lymph nodes(lymphoma)  or arising elsewhere (in ur case breast mass shud be looked upon as a possible source).must be searched for.......However....a Gen.surgeon needs to examine u carefully and with help of some investigations like FNAC or Excision Biopsy from the node, an accurate diagnosis can be made easily and treatments started as required....

I am now 39. Sometimes it is worse than others. Have had ultra sound on thyroid gland as well as test to see if thyroid was functioning properly. They say there is no problems with my thyroid. I have small lumps in my neck at the base of my throat & the sides of my neck which dr s have said are on my glands but no cause & they aren t concerned as they havent grown in the past 10 years. I have tried herbal things with no luck. I feel tired constantly no matter how good I sleep, eat, etc. It can be sometimes 6 months or a couple years when I get hit with really bad fatigue. When its like that I fall asleep if I sit down for more than 5 minutes & have no energy. I have had rapid weight loss (30 lbs in a week). I have also had rapid weight gain when this happens. I am 5ft 6 in tall & 145 lbs when things are normal. Within a week I can drop to 110 lbs or can go up to 180 lbs. I am not depressed. I am healthy & active. Just want an idea of what is causing me to feel so tired all the time.","Doctor":"its called cervical lympadinitis .. due to cronic infection .. you aneed to get evaluated .. first get an fnac done.. its an aspirating with a fine needle .. once diagnosis is established with that .. can start treatment accordingly"},{"Patient":"hi i have little lump between leg s liitle finger and second last finger....it has hard black tip...this is very small and i don t have any problem with it until i wear shoes which press then....it is very small in size and it s not fungal infection and it s dry too...i have this for the last one or one and a half month... please assist me ... thanks in advance Smriti Singhal age 28","Doctor":"could be sebacious cyst .. surgical excision is the best way to get rid of it. . a pic could help me to come to correct diagnosis"},{"Patient":"hello doctor i have mvp in my heart my father dead early 50years his age by heartattack.i have thyroid also and high prolactin and i am taking medicines for thyroid 100mg daily and for prolactin cabgolin medicine twice a week.some times i feel my heart beat is slow and my left hand full paining i scared because of mvp is it possible for heatattack and my age is 37 doctor told no need for medicines for mvp(mitral valve prolapse)now can u pls help me in future can i take any precaution for this mvp problem.","Doctor":"hello thanks for posting here.i have gone through your complaints. First of all when you say slow heart beat we need to confirm whether it's really slow or u feel that way. For this you have to measure count your heart beats or pulse or alternatively take an EKG, when you have such symptoms. It can be counted by placing two fingers on the forearm just below the wrist on thr side of the thumb. count the pulse for atleast 20 secs and multiply the figure by 3 (to get one minute reading). if this figure is above 55 then you need not worry. since you have hypothyroidism, your heart beats can be slow when you are on medications. you can do a thyroid function test to check your thyroid levels and to ascertain whether the doses you are taking are proper.Regarding MVP, usually tbereis no treatment unless there are other complicatio associated with it. MVP can cause leak from the valves - which needs no treatment if mild. If valve leak is moderate or severe, then you ahould be put on diuretics. This leak can be ascertained by a 2 D echo. however most patients of MVP I have seen have non significant or no leaks and require no treatment. Also it does not put you at the risk of heart disease. your site pulse maybe due to thyroid issues. don't worry even if complications aise, everything can be treated with medications and you won't require any surgery. regarsing precautions which you asked, there are no specific precautions, but you muet be regular with your follow ups and 2 D echo must be done every year. thank you."},{"Patient":"I have a lump just above my testicle it is connected to the testicle by something like a bit of string!then from the other side of the lump is a vein leading into my scrotum!the lump is not directly on the testicle but connected!i dont think its the epydermis because i can feel that on my testicle and the lump i feel is further alon the top of the testicle!what can it be?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome.Based on the facts of your query,the lump above testicle you have,seems to be INDIRECT Inginal Hernia/or Epididymla Cyst /or Spermatocele/Varicocele/Lipoma of the Cord.The possibility of it being Spermatocele or Epididymal Cyst is less and seems to be INDIRECT INGUINAL HERNIA,as you have clearly submitted that -a-there is a bit of string connecting the limp to the testicle b-and that lump is not directly on the testicle but connected to testicleb- and that you feel the lump on the testicle further on the top of the testicle.Investigation-USG study of the lump would show,air bubbles and fluid levels of the intestines,and would differentiate Indirect Inguial Hernia from the other lumps quoted above.
