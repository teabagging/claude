Good evening.

If the examination of the breast was negative, then he might put you on a broad spectrum antibiotic along with an anti inflammatory drug which might relieve you. Otherwise, he might plan for a FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) of the lump to arrive at a definitive diagnosis for planning an appropriate treatment.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Since I have been having blackouts everytime I stand up, this used to happen once and awhile but now it is all the time.  Is this somehow related to my heart or am I just worried because of what happened last week?","Doctor":"Hi ThereIf your stress test and ultrasound of heart has come out to be normal and your doctor has confirmed it then there is no need to worry about your heart.However the blackouts which are happening to you as you have described they happen while or after standing could be due to ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION (Fall in BP after standing). The nervous system (brain) makes changes in blood pressure and heart rate to allow the body to provide adequate blood supply to the brain when the body changes position. Symptoms of orthostatic hypotension include lightheadedness, weakness, blurred vision, and syncope or passing out. Leg stocking, proper hydration and medicine like FLUDROCORTISONE can help treat this but you need to consult a doctor personally for a written prescription.I would like to advise you to consult a physician personally and discuss for your options.I wish you good health"},{"Patient":"Hello, my daughter is 6 yesterday her left eye was really red today it is fine.

The eye problem could be due to the sympathetic congestion of the conjunctiva by the throat infection itself or could be due a coincidental conjunctivitis. If I were your doctor, I would have advised her for a throat swab culture and sensitivity test. When waiting for the report, I would have started some mild anti inflammatory syrup for her and advise for steam inhalations apart from gargles with an anti septic solution if she could.

It hurts a lot, usually when stretching my arm or putting deodorant on. I usually stays for about a week then goes away. What can cause it? my doctor says its a swollen lymph node last time I had it around easter. But now its back again.","Doctor":"Hi ! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.From your history, it looks like a sebaceous cyst in your arm pit which gets infected secondarily with bacteria to give rise to signs of inflammation like pain, redness, etc. If I were your doctor, after confirming my diagnosis by a personal local clinical examination, I would refer you to a general surgeon for a possible excision biopsy for a confirmation of the diagnosis and a cure. Till then, you could go for a over the counter anti inflammatory drug along with a proton pump inhibitor for a symptomatic relief only.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery. Dr Shareef."},{"Patient":"I have had the feeling of a lump in my throat for six months. It is relieved when I eat and sleep but comes right back.

What seems the most probable reason of your symptoms is GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). It is caused by stomach acid regurgitation to the esophagus. It may cause a chest tightness and lump in the throat as well.GERD should be treated with medicines called PPIs (proton pump inhibitors) like Omeprasole.You should also improve your diet: avoid fatty foods, spicy foods, chocolate, coffee, alcohol, orange juices.If diet and medicines want be helpful, you should consider surgery called fundoplication.Hope this will help.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi.

Smoking also leads to constipation and irregular bowel as well as increases the risk of coronary artery disease, stroke, lung cancer and many more life threatening diseases.Acid reflux also causes chest pain and it's aggravated again by smoking.The best remedy for all your discomfort is you should stop smoking first completely and you see the improvement within few days.It's also advisable that you should follow healthy lifestyle habits like going for daily morning walks for 5 days a week, avoid junk and canned food, include good amount of green leafy vegetables and fruits in your daily diet.For your constipation I would like to suggest that you should take hot cup of milk before sleep as it will work as a laxative and help clear bowel in morning.Also consult your doctor personally and get an EKG done to rule out any cardiac abnormality.For acid reflux you can take some proton pump inhibitor for 15 days once a day 20 mins before breakfast.

Good morning.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.One of the commonest cause of a lump in the area is a lymph node apart from other common swellings from a thyroid gland and both of these move with swallowing and could be mobile on touching. With a history of the lump persisting for six weeks, if I were your doctor, I would first give a try to a broad spectrum antibiotic for a week. If it did not work, I would go for a thyroid function test, a thorough examination of the oral cavity including head and neck and a FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) of the lump which would establish the diagnosis for further management.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

This is a very good questions you asked as there are many reasoning:The Lymph nodes in the neck due to tuberculosis may respond differently in all the patients. In some patients they may not be noticeable after a a proper treatment. In some patients they may regress , become small and remain so. In other patients it can show variation as in your case that they become become mobile and tender: The reason of tenderness can be secondary infection spread from the oral cavity or nasopharynx and nothing to worry about if you have increases weight gain, better appetite and so on.

It is not visible from the outside","Doctor":"Hi! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. Although it needs a physical examination of the lesion to arrive at a diagnosis, from the history it seems to me to be an infected lesion forming an abscess either de novo, or by a super added infection in a pre existing benign cyst or lump like a pilonidal abscess or an infected sebaceous cyst or dermoid. If I were your doctor, I would examine if it was a frank abscess both clinically and also by a FNAC. In this case, I would evacuate the abscess by incision and drainage possibly under a general anaesthesia for immediate relief. Once it was healed, I would go for an elective surgery of removing the lesion by an excision biopsy and sending the same for histopathological diagnosis. Till then you could go for an anti inflammatory drug along with a proton pump inhibitor for a symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery.

The lump is still there, and hurts after strenuous swimming and weight lifting. I has been suggested to remove the lump instead of re biopsy and ultrasound to make sure it is not something bad or more serious. I am worried that if it is removed, what are the risks to surrounding nerves in the collar bone area? I do not want a numb arm, hand etc. Still young. Should I just continue monitoring the lump yearly with expensive biopsy and ultrasounds or take the risk and remove it?? thank you","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for asking.Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Presence of lymphoid cells in a swelling indicates it is a lymphnode.2. As there were no malignant cells seen, not to worry. As the swelling is large and located at location, where the arms move around during swimming and weight lifting, it will be painful due to the mass movement.3. Excision of the swelling will improve the symptoms. As it is not related to any nerve or blood vessels, no risk of numbing of arm or hand is present. It would be simple surgery.

My chest burns and feels like someone is standing on it sometimes.","Doctor":"Hi! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. Even though it needs a physical examination of the neck region to reach at a conclusion, from the history it seems to be a cervical lymph node swelling or a thyroid related swelling if it is seen and felt on the outside of neck while yawning. If I were your doctor, after a general physical examination with special attention to the head and neck region, I would advise you for some investigations like a complete blood count including an ESR,  and a thyroid function test. Also an FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) of the lump and an x ray chest if need be could be helpful. Considering the symptoms of GERD (acid reflux) for a long time, I would not hesitate to refer you to a gastro enterologist for an endoscopic evaluation of your GI tract to rule out any organic cause of your feeling in the throat. In addition, you could do the following for getting some symptomatic relief from the symptoms of GERD :1) Elevate the head end of the bed with two blocks on each side, so that the regurgitation does not occur while lying down, and the contents of esophagus and stomach flow down with gravity.2) Some modification in your diet like more of roughage, enough liquids, avoidance of oily, fried, and fast food, and complete abstinence from alcohol and smoking if you do.3) Regular routine exercises like morning walk depending on your medical fitness.4) Prescription for a prokinetic agent and a proton pump inhibitor for symptomatic relief and to have a control on the acid production and facilitate movement of gastric contents downwards.Further management would depend on the reports of investigations.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

So it is imperative that is there is a mucus drainage this is more than required to be removed in-toto, meaning complete removal of the inner lining.

Since then I've noticed the following changes in my body:1.Swollen lymph nodes in groin, behing ear and below right jaw.2.Been losing a lot of weight, lost about 4-5kg in the last 6 weeks. Also losing muscle in my arms.3.Had a rash like black mark on my head.4.Been feeling uneasy lately.5.Had a minor night sweat last week.6.My eyes also seem to be unusually in pain lately.I have done the 4th generation ELISA test at 4 and 6 weeks which both came back negative. Also did the rapid antibody test at 10 weeks which also came back negative. I have now done the PCR HIV test as recommended by my doctor as i am in so much panic and seem to be overwhelmed with anxiety.My question is, what are the chances of my negative result changing to POS even though i seem to be experiencing these symptoms which seem to be in  line with those of HIV?Thanking You In Advance","Doctor":"Welcome to health care magic. 1.Enlarged lymph nodes can be due to infection / inflammation which can be localised or systemic.2.Multiple group lymph nodal enlargement with loss of weight - it could be lymph nodal pathology it self. 3.In this case i would recommend a through health checkup. A chest x-ray, abdomen pelvis ultrasound and enlarged lymph nodes to scan by ultrasound initially.4.That will give a gross idea about the underlying causes and nature of the nodes.5.Definitive diagnosis can be done with a FNAC - fine needle aspiration cytology of the enlarged lymph nodes.

I have been having pain on my right side of my abdomen for a while. I just recently noticed a lump that is deep about 2 inches below my rib cage and closer to the center of my stomach.

My husband, coworkers, fellow doctors I work with have felt it. I just need help and I don't want to waste all this money on a wild goose chase with no answer.

Good evening. Although opining on a lump needs a complete physical check up by the doctor, from the history of yours it seems that it could be a benign swelling like a lipoma which has become tender due to excessive fiddling of the swelling by your wife.

In case of a simple lump an FNAC could also be done to confirm the diagnosis.

Till then I would advise you for an anti inflammatory along with a proton pump inhibitor drug. Further management would depend on the reports of investigations.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery.

The swelling on the ankle and foot could also be due to cellulitis (inflammation of the tissues) as a result of the trauma.If I were your doctor, I would advise you for a foot elevation on a pillow whenever you are not mobile, give maximum rest to the traumatized leg, prescribe an anti inflammatory drug along with a proton pump inhibitor, a broad spectrum antibiotic and a probiotic.

Have also developed a hard lump on my outer right thigh.. Are all these connected?","Doctor":"Hi ! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. The lump on your forehead could be due to a traumatic hematoma (collection of blood) which would resolve of its own in a few days. Just take some anti inflammatory and a proton pump inhibitor for three to four days. The pain in your rectum could be due to a fissure in ano if you are constipated.In that case you should  go for an anti inflammatory drug along with a proton pump inhibitor, a broad spectrum antibiotic,a stool softener like lactulose liquid at bed time and a cream containing diltiazem. Add sitz bath to it (sitting on a luke warm water filled tub) three to four time a day for five minutes each. I am hopeful that you would get relief with this strategy, but I am afraid it would return if constipation (hard stool) occurs again for you. Therefore, to prevent the constipation, please avoid high protein diet, add a lot of roughage and fresh fruits along with sufficient liquids. Go for a regular exercise programme.To know the nature of the hard lump, one has to have a personal physical examination of the swelling, and if need be an FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) to have a nearest diagnosis.Further management would depend on the reports of the test.I would also let you know that both the later symptoms might not be related to the lump on the forehead, and might be independent entities by themselves.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Possibly your knee got sprained due to sudden bending kind of action during your walk, following which you developed a hematoma (collection of blood) around your knee, which could have been also due to a tear in the ligament/cartilage in your knee. If I were your doctor, after a physical examination, I would initially prescribe you with an anti inflammatory drug along with a proton pump inhibitor and apply a pressure bandage over your knee. If it does not subside in 48 hours of time, or if the hematoma increases in size along with an increase in the pain in knee with increasing restriction of movement, I would advise you for an MRI of the affected knee to rule out cartilagenous or a ligamentous injury which would require specialist treatment.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Now it looks like i have a ring worm or something on my ass crack. I have blistering type of liquid on my crack now. Do u have any idea of what it may be?","Doctor":"Hi.Read your history and understood your problem.In my opinion, this is a condition of dermatitis in the intergluteal region. The exact cause of this condition is not known, but this is treatable and can be cured.It usually starts as a itch, particularly n summer season. This is probable due to inability to clean up this area nicely with water, retention of the sweat, soap and so on.The itching causes small injuries and mild infection. The area may weep, gives fluidly secretion and causes more itching , particularly at night.Patients starts using whatever ointments are available or suggested by friends, family or local Doctors. Feels good, but the disease remains there to recur or have vexing and vanning. Many patients have some or the other problems with digestion or motion.I do advise all such patients as follows::-Clean the area with plain water as frequently as possible.-Apply liquid Povidone Iodine locally to the whole area and allow it to dry.No other ointments or lotions/ soaps / chemicals are needed.-A small course of an antibiotic and Metronidazole for about 5 days ( you need a prescription please- of a local Doctor)-This is basically a disorder due to deficiency of vitamins and minerals that the integrity of the skin is lost. So you have to have therapeutic dosage of Vitamin A and D and to continue as multivitamins which are available as anti-oxidant medicines for about a month or so."},{"Patient":"I have a very large purple welt ĺooking lump in my inner bum cheek.

If nothing is conclusive even after a course of a broad spectrum antibiotic and an anti inflammtory drug, the examining doctor might advise you to go for an FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) to know the most probable reason or origin for the lymph node swelling, or any other swelling posing as the lump.

I am a 21 years old athletic male that plays sports on a regular basis including soccer and bodybuilding.

Nonetheless, it has started growing bigger suddenly in the past 1-2 weeks and is becoming red increasingly, making me have to scratch the area around it (trying to minimize any touching).

It started being small and has grown. I have had this for several years and no one gives me any certain answer. It has probably grown to four times the original size and is very sensitive to any kind of pressure. I recently had a deep vein thrombosis test and some sort of blood flow test and they were normal. What could this be and what can I do to help with the sensitivity. I also have a problem with swelling with this leg.","Doctor":"Swelling in the calf for years without causing any symptoms like pain or ulceration,mostly likely to be a lipoma or benign soft tissue tumor.. A type of lipoma called neurolipoma can very painful when you touch...it's difficult to say what is it without seeing.. I advice you to get a aspiration test done from the swelling.. In medical term we call it FNAC.. If the swelling is not clearly visible go for an MRI of calf..

Please advise me on my problem.Thanks, Naveen 36 yrs old male","Doctor":"From the symptoms what you have said I feel your   suffering from acute fissure in ano..It means your having a small ulcer inside your anus which is causing pain when your passing stools..it can cause intense itching when the ulcer gets stained with stool..The small lump what u see is called sentinel pile..from the ulcer, secretion gets stagnated at the base and cause a thickening.. U have to do few things..first u have take a basin filled with lukewarm water  and mix it with pinch of salt.u have to sit with anal region touching the water.. This will bring down the pain.. Second take stool  softener like isapgol husk 2 teaspoons mixed with milk at bed time.. Apply lignocaine gel 2% in the anal region 10 minutes before passing stools..along with take plenty of water and add frui ts and vegetables in your diet ..

Over the last few years I have had been perscribed iron tablets before, with this time presenting more symptoms","Doctor":"hello,  There are two possibilities, one is gastritis and reflux disease and second is cardiac arrhythmia.    It probably be a acidity and reflux disease. Do you upper abdominal pain, nausea, burping, increase in pain on food, sour water feeling in throat or chest burning, if yes it further supports the diagnosis. You should avoid fatty, oily and high calorie diet. Have some walk after having food instead of taking rest. Have multiple small meals instead of heavy meals. Have regular sleep habits and avoid stress. Lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. Iron supplements tend to these symptoms, if having a lot you can take supplements after food.You can get prescribed tab Pan DSR 40 mg beforebreakfast once a day for 2 weeks.    If none of the above symptoms are present, then there is a possibility of cardiac arrhythmia like psvt or atrial fibrillation, in which heart rate suddenly goes up and also suddenly decreases. Blood pressure falls during these episodes and one has dizziness, fainting, blackouts, sometimes syncope. Usually ecg is normal as it is usually done in between the episodes. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality, so try to get ecg done during the episode. If ecg is not informative then you will need 24 hour holter monitoring if episodes are occurring on daily basis. So visit nearby cardiologist for these investigation. Till the time your evaluation is complete, you can ask your local doctor for tab ciplar LA 20 mg once a day."},{"Patient":"My husband has a very large extremely painful lump inside his scrotum.

Please could you tell me what it is or if I should not worry .","Doctor":"Hi! Good afternoon. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.The lump in the location stated by you could be an inguinal hernia which could go inside the abdomen on pressure and on lying down, and might come back again on increasing the intra abdominal pressure. You have to verify by your self if both your testes are in position or not. Sometimes, one of the testes might not descend normally down the scrotum and it might be felt in the area located by you known as inguinal region. Both the above condition might give rise to pain in the abdomen on pressure. The third possibility could just be an enlarged lymph node which would also move, but might not cause pain n the abdomen/stomach. All these could be diagnosed and managed only after a personal physical examination and related investigations, and so I would advise you not to worry, but to get in touch with your family physician/ a surgeon in your area with your parents/guardian for an appropriate opinion and management.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

He saw his PCP and was given a corticosteroid cream yesterday but it hasn t helped at all so far. He also was advised to make an appt with a surgeon for a 2nd opinion because PCP was not sure exactly what it was.","Doctor":"Yes I agree with your PCP you need to get it examined by a surgeon.

She has CRPS in her left wrist which she writes with, a ganglion cyst in the same wrist, and amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome ( also known as RSD, RND, etc.) The problem is in her wrist. The cyst has gotten bigger and more painful. Around six months ago she completed physical therapy, and they said if it gets any worse to go back to her orthopedist and that it would most likely require surgery. We haven t taken her back yet, but we were wondering what to expect. More details...Her cyst was 8mm (0.8 cm) before and now it is about the size of a marble. (We can tell because it now pops up on the skin)She can t write or do any sports or lifting of any kind. It never gets fully better. Only worse or bearable.This has been a problem for around two years or so.","Doctor":"Your daughter seem s to have two problems they may or may not be related to each other. As far as the ganglion on the wrist is concerned in the light of the symptoms she has it is advisable to get it excised surgically but the important thing to be noted or kept in mind is that the pain she is experiencing may or may not resolve with the surgery and there is an very remote possibilty that this ganglion might reoccur.So it is advisable to revisit your orthopedcian and also get a second opinion since it  is a complex situation. Examination gives additional information and so get it checked and getting an opinion is worthwhile and then keeping the cons and pros of the procedure you can go ahead. She may also have to visit a pain clinic specialist."},{"Patient":"Fell today hard on my right side. Not sure what happened. One minute I am talking to someone next minute I m on the ground.

For the next 2 days bringing me to today I had the dull pain but only when ever I ate other than that it was non existent. Then after getting home from shopping earlier today I generally brushed my hand down my neck and felt this massive lump about the size of a gold ball. When I looked in the mirror it was clearly visible. So I shouted to my dad outside who was leaving for work, he booked an appointment at the doctors for 5pm by that time the lump had shrunk to the point where it wasn t so visible but you could definitely feel it. Anyway the doctor said I most likely cracked/tore the gland when screaming this then caused bacteria to enter when eating causing an infection. So he prescribed me a regular dosage of the antibiotics amoxicillin of 1 dose of 250mg 3 times a day, and tomorrow I have to go to the hospital to have a blood sample taken. Personally it feels like the lump ness has moved ever so slightly to the middle of my chin. Is this a serious problem to be worried about even after getting the medical advice. I am currently aged 15 and male & never had anything like this happen, and I am not too worried per say of what s happening but a little concerned on what could happen, could someone shed me some light on what is going g o?","Doctor":"yes this condition will need follow up with your doctor and this soft tissue injury should subside with medical treatment. It is worthwhile waiting to give it a chance to heal this way.

Sudden onset 3 weeks ago as he was walking 5 miles and hadn t walked that much in a while. Had cramping at that time. Worse when he points his toes. Gets occassional cramping still. Swelling in ankle/calf/maybe upper foot. Swelling hasn t resided and I can see a small red spot with inconsistent edges that is warm but not hot to the touch. When he wears a sock the swelling is reduced within the sock area so then the calf hangs over where sock was. Has what I would call a cankle . He also has had for a long time small varicose veins, all little ones all over and around both ankles. Some blue but all small and skin a bit red poched on both ankles/lower calves.

When i popped it yellow colored pus came out then blood. Now there is a tack sized hole where i popped this thing. Can you tell me what these are and how to prevent them from coming back?","Doctor":"Hi! Good afternoon. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Possibly either it was a boil or an infected sebaceous cyst and on popping it exuded its infected material out. The hole so created might heal by itself slowly and the condition is cured. If it was a cyst which got secondarily infected, it would not vanish even after healing, and would remain there as an elevated cyst, which might again get infected time and again to give rise to similar symptoms. In that case the permanent cure would be to remove it surgically and send it for histopathology for confirmation. The prevention of such infection to come or the cysts getting infected is to observe strict personal hygiene along with avoidance of fiddling with any pre existing cyst in the area. If these keep on recurring, you should consult a Dermatologist for an appropriate treatment.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Thank you in advance","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for your query. I can understand your concerns.It seems that you are having Olecranon bursitis which is an inflammation of olecranon bursa (small sacs of fluid  that help joints move smoothly) at the back of the elbow . The swelling or lump is caused by increased fluid within the bursa and is tender with movement or when touched.Mild but repeated injury (direct  or indirect-as in tour case ) is thought to be the common cause.It often clears on its own. Treatment may be needed in some cases to reduce the inflammation and clear any build-up of fluid.You may find the swelling improves with (R)est, (I)ce packs, (C)ompression (wearing a bandage) and (E)levation (keeping the elbow in a raised position).Avoid leaning on your elbows, protecting your elbows during sports activities with elbow pads (in future), and use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs) to relieve swelling and pain.Treatment for sudden (acute) bursitis may include drainage of excess fluid in the sac with a needle.Regards Dr. T.K.

My schedule has been very busy and am stressing much. What do you think Is wrong with me? I await your response.","Doctor":"Hi! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If you really lost weight, it is not necessary for you to be HIV positive. There are very many reasons of loss of weight starting from diabetes mellietus, Thyrotoxicosis, Tuberculosis and being HIV positive. If I were your doctor, I would advise you for routine blood tests like CBC, Blood sugar, thyroid functions tests, and of course a HIV test. Further management would depend on the reports of investigations and physical findings.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Does he exercise ; if no then he need to start with a brisk morning walk for 45 mins a day 5 days a week4. Tell him to start having fruits and green vegetables in his diet in good amount.As his BP is on higher side so I would like to start him on a low dose BETA BLOCKERS like METOPROLOL to control his heart rate as well as Bp.

What is the bump and is the pain coming from?","Doctor":"Hi,The injury you sustained can lead to quite a lot of pain even though your X-ray was normal. This is due to soft tissue injury and hematoma which is a collection of blood that spreads in the surrounding tissues. This will cause a lumpiness to develop in the area which can be very sensitive. It will return to normal but this may take a few weeks. In the meantime, take paracetamol and ibuprofen for the pain and swelling. You may benefit from sitting on a padded support under your tailbone. Avoid activities which make the pain worse. I wish you a speedy recovery.

Your Sincerely Michelle Moke","Doctor":"Hi,A ganglion cyst is a fluid-filled swelling that develops near a joint or a tendon. The cyst can range from the size of a pea to the size of a golf ball. This is not a serious complaint. Ganglion cysts look and feel like a smooth, soft lump under the skin. They are made up of a thick, jelly-like fluid, called synovial fluid, which surrounds joints and tendons to lubricate and cushion them during movement.There is no need to seek medical attention unless she experiences pain, swelling or stiffness of the area. They can be removed surgically if needed.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.The very fact that the lump is painful points it to be of inflammatory either primary or secondary to any other possibly benign lesion. It is more likely to be an inflamed lymph node as I suppose and there has to be an inflamed focus for it. This could be known only by a detailed physical examination. Therefore, I would advise you to get yourself examined by your family physician, who might advise you for a course of antibiotics and an anti inflammatory drug for a few days.

The cut is tiny and unnoticeable unless looking for it. Shortly after I noticed the back of my left testicle had got larger. It feels quite lumpy and strange. I can not feel the lumps when sitting but when I stand they appear again. There is a dull ache coming from this testicle now. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi ! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.From your history, it seems to me that the cut on the skin of your scrotum and the lumpy feeling of your testis on the left side might be two different entities. Possibly you might be having varicocele (varicose testicular veins), which is common on the left side. The varicolele would also increase on standing due to gravitational backflow of blood in the vein and it would become less prominent on sitting or lying down. These would feel lumpy (like a bag of worms), and would cause dull aching pain of the testis on the side involved. The management of this condition is by a good testicular support, and if the symptoms increase, then surgery of the vericose veins. However, before this, it has to be confirmed with a Doppler ultrasound of both testes. Till then, you could go for an anti inflammatory along with a proton pump inhibitor.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I have a similar case, but this last question did not specify whether the lump was on top of the skin or under the skin as my lump is. I believe I recall having this lump for a little over two months. I thought it was due to me shaving and maybe forming an ingrown hair, but now it causes discomfort or pain when I wash that region. Im worried about (god forbid) a tumor. What is your professional opinion (sight unseen of course)?","Doctor":"Hi ! Good afternoon. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Even though it needs a personal physical examination to opine on the lesion, from your history alone, this could be a pilonidal cyst, which gave rise to pain on being infected, and on discharge of the infected material could form a pilonidal sinus. I would advise you to take an appointment with a general surgeon in your area for further management of the lesion.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

It isn t red, hot or swollen like I ve read up about It only hurts when I try to put an earring in, I don t want it to close up but do you you know what I should do to help it heal and keep the piercing open? I just want these lumps gone! Hope you can help","Doctor":"Hi! Good afternoon. i am Dr Shareef answering your query. Many ear lobes react to any kind of foreign body, specially to artificial jwelleries, causing inflammation resulting in such bumps in the long run due to chronicity. If I were your doctor, I would advise you to take out the studs for some time till the foreign body reaction gets subsided and the bumps vanish. Then you could rather redo the holes under sterile conditions by a ENT surgeon and not in the open market where sterility is not maintained, and go for a gold ring rather than an artificial jewellery, which are known to react to the skin more than that made up of gold.I hope this answers your query.

That s kind of what it feels like but its really big and is irritating me. It doesnt hurt to bad unless I put pressure on it. I havent tried popping it yet. Im just really concerned. Please message back and let me know what you think it might be.","Doctor":"Hi, dear. I have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  You may have some abscess or soft tissue mass.

Is there any way I can figure it which one it may be before going to the doctor, if needed. And if it is a lymph node, will things like straining, masturbation, or further irritation make it worse?","Doctor":"Hi ! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.It could only be known by clinical examination of the lump by your family physician/general surgeon whether it is a lymph node or a hernia. A hernia would be reducible unless it has become irreducible, and also the location would be different. Straining might increase the size of a hernia, but would not cause any difference to a lymph node swelling. If the lymphadenitis is due to some kind of infection being spread by any of the draining areas like the lower limb, or genitalia, it might get smaller and relieved by anti inflammatory and antibiotic drugs, but there would be no effect on hernia by these. At the end I would advise you to get yourself assessed by your family physician or a general surgeon to be certain of the aetiology of the lump.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

If I  were your doctor, after a clinical examinatioin of the lump, I would advise you for a  complete blood count, a blood sugar, and possibly a FNAC of the lump. Till the report of the investigation arrives, I would start a broad spectrum antibiotic along with an anti inflammatory drug for a symptomatic relief. It might even get better if the antibiotic is appropriate for the organism causing the infection. Further management would depend on the reports of the investigations.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery.

Good evening. i am Dr Shareef answering your query.The description of yours of the lumps seemingly connected with the vein could be a bilateral vericocele (dilated veins) which is not uncommon in young adults specially in those who stand for prolonged periods of time. However, they are not very clear cut lump as noted by you. This could be some kind of benign cyst connected to the testes.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.From your history it seems that you have got a boil with surrounding cellulitis over the area. If I were your doctor, I would advise you first for a blood sugar estimation to rule out any chances of Diabetes mellitus and treat it if positive to control the infection. If the swelling is increasing inspite of the antibiotic, and little amount of pus has shown itself up, there could be a deep seated abscess which would need drainage. Therefore, I would refer you to the ER of the nearest hospital or to a general surgeon, who would do the needful possibly under some kind of anaesthesia.

If no blood in stools no need to do aurgery for piles but you should see gynacologist once as you may be having rectocele.Regards."},{"Patient":"I am a 20 year old female.  I am 5'5\\" and I weigh about 145 lbs. A few weeks ago, I noticed a hard lump on my head. It is probably the size of a nickel. It is on the left side of my skull, near the ear. It is hard, like a bone. It doesn't hurt when I touch it. What could this be?","Doctor":"Hi! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Even though it needs a clinical examination to decide on the lump, if I were your doctor, I would go for an x-ray skull to rule out a bony origin or a bony erosion due to the growth. In case it is not arising from bone, and is mobile, I would not hesitate to go for an excision biopsy of the lump. Further treatment would depend on the histo-pathology report.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery.

Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Yes, you should go to your treating doctor for a review clinical examination of the swelling which lasted for last 4 weeks.

Broke the skin a bit, ankle swelled a bit and bruising mostly around the the ankle.  Now I have have a lumb about the size of a medium marble on the shin. I would not dare touch the shin.  Not even with a razor.  Now tender if bumped or press applied directly. I'm still skittish with it at times. My knee seems to ache more. Often after sitting a bit, and I stretch, it feels like something is being pulled away inside.  Kind of like a scab if it's on a area that when flexed stretches out the skin.  Not painful but certainly noticeable.  Should I be conderned? tendons/ligaments trying to adhere to the bone?  Bone chipped? I'm able to run, cycle, row...  Will lumb go away. This looks like I have some sort of tumorous growth on my shin.","Doctor":"Hi! Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.This could be a hematoma (collection of blood) due to the trauma, which has not yet got absorbed. A simple hematoma would gradually get absorbed of its own unless there is persisting oozing or if it gets infected. The exact status could be known by a clinical examination by a surgeon and a fine needle aspiration if need be. Therefore, I would suggest you to get an appointment with a general surgeon for an appropriate diagnosis and further management.
