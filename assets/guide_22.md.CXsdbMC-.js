You have not mentioned since how long you have been trying for pregnancy because infertility is termed only if after 1 year of unprotected intercourse, you are not getting pregnant. For conception, try having intercourse every month around your ovulation days as it is the best time for conceiving. It usually occurs regularly, around day 14 of a 28-day menstrual cycle. The best timing of intercourse in order to conceive is day 10, 12, 14 and 16 (in case of late ovulation) of a 28 day cycle. You can use an ovulation predictor kit for detecting the ovulation time also. After intercourse, do not wash immediately and keep on lying for half an hour. If still you are unable to conceive, then the various medical causes need to be investigated. Consult an infertility expert then. Hope it helps. Regards."},{"Patient":"i wana pregnent","Doctor":"You're more likely to become pregnant in any particular month if you have intercourse during your most fertile period - the days just before and after you ovulate. Ovulation usually occurs about 14 days before the start of your next menstrual period. If you would like to figure out when you're likely to ovulate next, you'll need to know the approximate length of your menstrual cycle. Fertilization occurs when a sperm penetrates the egg - and this typically takes place in one of the fallopian tubes. The fertilized egg then travels to uterus and implants in the uterine lining.

Common adverse drug reactions associated with the use of clomifene (≥1% of patients) include: vasomotor flushes (or hot flashes ), abdominal discomfort, visual blurring (dose-dependent), and/or reversible ovarian enlargement and cyst formation. Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of patients) include: abnormal uterine bleeding, nausea, and/or vomiting. Rare adverse effects ( Clomifene can lead to multiple ovulation, hence increasing the chance of twins (10% of births instead of the normal ~1%).

We already have 2 kids and had a miscarriage in 2008. My girlfriend also thinks that she had 2 more miscarriages in Oct & Nov last year (2010). My doctor said that I should have a semen analysis done, and the results showed a Sperm Morphology of 93%. He referred me to a fertility specialist, who didnt sound like he knew what he was talking about. He advised me to stop taking Creatine and Protein supplements (which I m taking for weight training ), and then do another test. I m not sure that the Creatine and Protein supplements can cause negative Sperm Morphology issues, as everything I ve read suggests that they are actually beneficial to aid these types of problems, and because they are naturally produced by the body. So I was looking for a 2nd opinion. Also, I forgot to tell him I ve been using hair removing cream around my genitals, and was wondering if that could have affected the results at all ? He seems to think that my results werent accurate because I already have 2 kids and because my girlfriend had atleast 1 miscarriage, which means that unless I have suffered trauma to my genitals (which I havent) he cant think of any reason how the morphology could be that high. Also, in case he is right about the Creatine, how long should I wait after stopping my supplements before I should give another sample ? In other words, how long will it take for the extra levels of Creatine to leave my body and not affect my test results ?

I am Dr Soumen Patra and try to solve your problem sothat you can take right decision.You have a 6yr old baby and presently you are not able to conceive. So you are suffering from \\"SECONDARY INFERTILITY\\" You also have irregular period.Lets start a wide discussion on \\"IRREGULAR PERIOD & PREGNANCY\\" Irregular periods refers to a change in regular menstrual periods or menses. Mostly it ranges anywhere from 21 to 35 days. Every woman usually has a certain cycle length that is rather constant but sometimes varies 1-2 days per month. Remember that the onset of menses for every 35 days (regularly) is not considered as irregular menstrual cycle. However, irregular periods can be either of short term or long-term irregularity. CAUSES: The irregular cycle is mostly related to stresses, tension, ingested medications and caffeine, a substance that disrupt corpus luteum function or even act as anticoagulant blood thinner. Cigarette smoking is another reason for abnormal cycles because it shortens the follicular phase. It also shortens the luteal phase if smoking is heavy. However, extreme alcohol intake is also a reason. OTHER CAUSES: significant weight gain or loss, over-exercise, breastfeeding, PCOS/estrogen dominance, malnutrition, medications, chemotherapy, eating disorders, hormonal imbalance, recent childbirth, miscarriage or uterine abnormalities (fibroids/cysts/polyps/endometriosis). The occasional skipped menses cycle is not the only symptom of this problem. However, continued abnormality in period is also an indication of irregular ovulation and irregular menstruation cycle. TREATMENT: As irregular menstrual cycle is treated according to the cause, it is determined with a blood test, ultrasound and biopsy. Often hormonal imbalance will be the major cause for irregular periods, which can be treated with appropriate drugs or hormones. Surgical removal of polyps or fibroids may also be done, if required. Treatment for irregular periods is also based on your plan for children. If you decide to have pregnancy, then a hormonal contraceptive or supplement will be prescribed to regulate your menstrual cycles. Never get tense regarding slight change or variation in your regular menstrual period. More than 50 percent of healthy women have the problem of Irregular menstrual cycle. However, consult your gynecologist if you are always with abnormal menstrual cycle. First you have to regulate your period and proper timing of sexual intercourse is also necessary.  Dont loose your spirit. keep cool and it increases your fertility. If further consultation is needed,then contact with me, my id: soumenmmch@gmail.com All the best."},{"Patient":"I have been having intermittant chest pains more to one side of my chest of the last couple of days, i put this down to stress as i have a demanding job and life style, However yesterday afternoon i lost feeling in my left arm whilst suffering the worst pain i had yet.

However you should understand that ivf success rates are not very encouraging."},{"Patient":"have endometriosis cyst in my left overy. we removed the cyst thru laparoscopic surgery at 2008 after with natural conception we got baby on August 2009.

Please help","Doctor":"hii mam, I am Dr Soumen Patra and try to solve your problem. You are currently suffering from PCOS and trying for a baby. Lets start a detail discussion: A female gets her pregnancy if all underlying factors are favourable from both of partners like Patent Tube, Ovulation in Time, Anatomically Normal Uterus and Adequate Sperm count of Husband. If any of factors is abnormal,start to suffer from INFERTILITY. I think that you are currently under treatment of PCOS. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is one of the main causes of infertility in women. It affects anywhere from 5-10% of women between the ages of 20 and 40 and associated with anovulation, making it the most common reproductive syndrome for women of this age group. GUIDELINE: what to do?? 1)Do a fresh semen analysis for husband to see any abnormality. if all thing nomal,then it is ok. 2) Now start treatment for ANOVULATION with consult of your gynaecologist. Option as follows: * Clomephene Citrate> 50mg/ day starting from D2 to D6 of cycle and ovulation is monitored with serial ultrasound. if response not satisfactory,100 mg/ day can be given.  if above fail,combination of CC +hMG> patient advise to take Clomephene 50-100 mg/day from D2-D6 + inj hMG 75 unit IM on D3, D5 and D7 or more. *if above fail, hMG + hCG can be given in amenorrhoeic low estrogen women. GnRH can be given alternative to hMG and ovulation rate 75-85% and pregnancy rate 25-30% *PREDNISOLONE is also administered 5 mg at night + 2.5 mg every morning until spontaneous ovulation occurs.  Hyperprolactinaemia is treated with BROMOCRIPTINE 1.25 mg @ bedtime daily for 7 days. *In PCOS women , if ovulation induction is failed with medical treatment,then \\"LAPAROSCOPIC OVARIAN DRILLING OF FOLLICLES with MONOPOLAR CAUTERY\\" gives stisfactory result. So dont be upset and I think this gives you a valuable information. All you need to do just consult your gynaecologist. All the best."},{"Patient":"My son aged 34 married for 3 yrs no child undergone vericocelectomy,His semdn analysis show spermcount 40 million/ml motility 55% rapidly progressive 18% and sluggishly progressive 37% and normal shape 68% What are the chances of his having a child","Doctor":"chances of having pregnancy are good but if you just add Cap.Addyzoa 1 bd and milk with dried dates the chances for getting preg. should be almost 99 percent. dr_patients@hotmail.com"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor , I am 31yrs old and my husband has a very low sperm count and no motility.

Thanks for asking on Healthcaremagic. Yes you are right. You are having an anxiety attack. You might need anti anxiety medications and might need to consult a psychologist for the same. It is important to modify your lifestyle. Do some relaxation techniques like yoga or meditation and keep stress at bay. Always keep one thing in mind that pondering over the situation and getting tensed over what will happen will not change the future. On the other hand such a stress about your future will hamper you mentally and impair your strength to deal with the after effects of what happens. Instead, accept all that happens with a smile and divert your energies to find solutions to whatever happens and turn the tables in your favor.

Intrauterine insemination has very little chance of working in women over 40 years old. IUI has also been shown to have a reduced success rate in younger women with a significantly elevated day 3 FSH level, or other indications of significantly reduced ovarian reserve. With significant male factor issues, IVF with ICSI is indicated and has high success rates for women under age 40. The risk for complications with intrauterine insemination is very low. The woman could develop an infection in the uterus and tubes from bacterial contamination that originated either in the semen sample, or through a contamination of the sterile catheter in the vagina or cervical area during the procedure. Careful cleaning of the cervix and cautious technique make this a rarity."},{"Patient":"I am a male.

Older women usually respond poorly to ovarian stimulation and the live birth rates even with IVF treatment are significantly lower than with younger women. The older women are at increased risk of having medical problems in their pregnancies and deliveries. In order to improve the success rate of IVF treatment in older women, some clinics recommend assisted hatching, blastocyst embryo transfer, and preimplantation diagnosis and only transfer normal embryos. Furthermore in some countries the transfer of high number of embryos is recommended.  Other options of treatment include egg donation using eggs donated by younger woman, embryo donation if the male partner also has a sperm problem, surrogacy if a woman (traditional surrogate) agrees to become pregnant using the male partner sperm and her own eggs, adoption and foster care and accepting child-free living."},{"Patient":"hello doctor,i am 28 yrs old ,f, married for 5 years .My husband (28yrs old) and i trying for a baby but failed.I had my transvaginal ultrasound test which was normal and after this i had my HSG test recently which shows that my uterus is fine ,right tube is fine but my left tube is filled but not spilled.What does this mean???will i ever be pregnant and what will be the next procedure.please help.","Doctor":"According to the HSG report, it probably means that the left tube is blocked.

Recently I and my husband had met fertility expert who has advised me to undergo ICSI since my husband has some problem with his sperm quality. What is the procedure about?","Doctor":"ICSI is intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection, newest fertility technique. ICSI method is used  as in your case when infertility is mostly due to male sperm issues.ICSI is a very effective method to get fertilization of eggs in the In-vitro fertilization lab after they have been retrieved from the female partner. ICSI involves the use of specialized micromanipulation tools and equipment and inverted microscopes that enable embryologists to select and then pick up individual sperms in a tiny specially designed hollow ICSI needle. Then the needle is carefully advanced through the outer shell of the egg and egg membrane and the sperm is then injected into the inner part (cytoplasm) of the egg.  This will usually result in normal fertilization in approximately 70-85% of eggs injected with viable sperm. First, the woman must be stimulated with medications and have an egg retrieval procedure so that we can obtain several eggs in order to attempt in vitro fertilization and ICSI.ICSI differs from In-vitro fertilization, wherein one egg is mixed with 1 lakh sperms, with fertilization taking place on its own, ICSI is a technique where each egg is held and injected with a single live sperm. This micro-fertilization is done with the help of a machine called the Micromanipulator.

Now he is fine. He had been to a Clinical Psychologist and found real improvments. So, go on."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, why does fertility declines with age? Any reason.","Doctor":"Ageing of the ovaries is the most prominent factor and is part of the normal ageing changes that affect all organs and tissues. Most women have about 300,000 eggs in their ovaries at puberty. For each egg that matures and is released during the menstrual cycle, at least 500 eggs do not mature and are absorbed by the body. By the time the woman reaches menopause which usually occurs between 50-55 years, there are only several thousands of eggs remaining. As the woman ages, the remaining eggs in her ovaries also age, making them less capable of fertilization and their embryos less capable of implanting. Fertilization is associated with a higher risk of genetic abnormalities like Down syndrome with increasing age. The risk of a chromosomal abnormality in a woman age 20 years is 1/500 while the risk in woman age 45 is 1/20.Gynecological problems such as pelvic infection, tubal damage, endometriosis, fibroids, ovulation problems etc tends also to increase with age. As the woman gets older, she has more time to develop these conditions, which will adversely affect her fertility. Sexual function is also decreased with ageing. The effect of ageing ability of the endometrium to receive the embryo is controversial. There is increasing evidence that the receptivity decreases with age. Ageing does not just affect women, but also men to a much lesser degree. It affects sperm and coital frequency. There is no maximum age at which men are not capable of conceiving a child. Advanced maternal age increases the risk of autosomal dominant diseases such as Marfans syndrome, neurofibromatosis and achondroplasia."},{"Patient":"I got the mirena iud put in Oct of 07 and taken out Dec of 08...Since Dec weve been trying to get pregnant and its just not happening and im really starting to think something is wrong!!!

What I m reading online is that parathyroidism and vit. D deficiency would produce a lowered blood calcium, whereas mine is above normal, so I am confused. Wouldn t an absorption problem result in a higher blood calcium level? and what is the relationship of hyperathyroidism and a thyroid nodule. My father pass 50 yrs ago with a pituitary tumor..any reason to suspect a correlation? I am scheduled to see a surgeon in a few days, but the change in fingernail causes me concern. My endocrinologist reports no sign of kidney stones, but could the fingernail indicate a different problem with my kidneys?","Doctor":"Hello, In case of chronic kidney disease patients may develop anemia due to erythropoietin deficiency.

I have taken a look at these numbers. They are not ideal but somewhat just over the bar for the normal upper limit. The good news is that these numbers have been stable over the months and implies that it is not an ongoing disease process. For now, these numbers are not alarming and undergoing further aggressive testing to explore even further may not be the wisest of decisions. It is already good enough that this subtle increase has been picked up and would be monitored to see when more testing and intervention would be needed. There is no reason to be too concerned about this right now. As for water, drink as much as the body requires.

Thanks,","Doctor":"Hi, Swollen lymph nodes in the neck area are commonly seen and in most cases, if there are no other symptoms, it doesn’t indicate any disease. However, if there are additional symptoms such as fever, the rapid growth of node, cough, weight loss or excessive swelling then this may be something pathological and require treatment. In these cases, it is most commonly caused by some sort of infection. The most common cause of swollen lymph nodes is an infection, particularly a viral infection, such as the common cold. Other possible causes of swollen lymph nodes include Strep throat, Measles, Ear infections, Infected (abscessed) tooth, Mononucleosis. Mononucleosis is commonest along with the young people and this should be ruled out first. Then it can be treated with antibiotics or other medications depending on the established cause. He should drink more fluids, take ibuprofen and rest as much as possible till symptoms persist. In doubtful cases, lymph nide biopsy can be taken but I don’t think this is necessary at this point.

Before any major surgery, your surgeon will check your vital signs. Unless and until all your systems are working fine & all blood workouts show normal reports, surgery cannot be done.

More serious cases with intractable pain may require drainage with a stent or percutaneous nephrostomy. Treatment of nephrolithiasis involves emergency management of renal (ureteral) colic, including surgical interventions where indicated, and medical therapy for stone disease.

I havent had a lot if pain today but i have blood in urine and a pressure feeling in abdomen still. Also i have been pooping mucus with blood in it. Is this normal with kidney stones or is it caused by the medicines? I am on toredol, oxycodine, flomax and ibprofine","Doctor":"Hi, Let me start my answer with a small description of the kidneys, ureter and urinary bladder. The collecting system of the kidney is made of renal calyces and pelvis. This collects the urine formed in the kidney and transports it through the ureter (tubes connecting kidneys and urinary bladder) to the urinary bladder. I guess that you have got an ultrasound scan done and it shows hydroureteronephrosis, that is a term applied to increase in diameter of the ureter which carries urine from the kidneys to urinary bladder due to a stone from the kidney getting stuck in the mid or lower part of the ureter. Since you have a 3 mm stone in the ureter, it is possible that the stone is now in the lower part of the ureter. This is causing an obstruction and please drink adequate water to allow the stone to come out of the lower ureter and into the urinary bladder. You might have pain at this time which will disappear once the stone reaches the urinary bladder. When this happens you might experience severe sharp pain for few days and require pain killers for sometime. It is best to consult the urologist and take prescription of medications like alpha blocker which will cause contraction of smooth muscles in the ureter and cause the stone to travel down in to the urinary bladder. Doing kidney function blood tests and repeat ultrasound might also be required. Neeri syrup and Pathrina tablets are recommended by Ayurvedic doctors for kidney stones and work best as long the stones are in the kidneys. However, if the stone is stuck in the ureter as in your case then these medications will not be of much help because urinary obstruction is there. Continuous obstruction in ureters for more than a month can cause kidney damage. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards, Dr. Ivan R.

It would be a good idea to report what you’ve noticed to your GP, and to arrange for a sample to be sent to the laboratory for analysis. Any blood, pus, crystals, or infection will be reported. If you have symptoms of thrush such as itching, soreness, irritation, or thick white discharge, then it would be wise to get treatment from your GP. If your urine test is reported as normal there is no need to worry. Drinking plenty of water will reduce your chances of having problems with urine infections or cystitis in the future.

There are no medications that can dissolve the stone. These stone either pass out through urine spontaneously or has to be removed or fragmented by intervention endoscopically depending upon the site of the stone, size of the stone and back pressure changes in kidney or collecting system and severity of symptoms like pain etc. Normally stone up to size of 8 mm can be expected to pass out spontaneously and dos not require any active intervention. Consult qualified Urologist for clinical assessment and get the following basic tests done: 1) Urine routine and culture. 2) Ultrasound scanning of abdomen and pelvis 3) A blood test to detect Serum Uric Acid levels Ensure to drink more water to produce more urine this will help to pass out the stone spontaneously. Take antibiotic like Ciprofloxacin or Nitrofurantoin twice daily if there is evidence of infection in urine detected on urine analysis.

These symptoms are breathing difficulty, leg swelling, Edema in the lungs, and fatigue. All of these are seen because of the fluid overload or the lack of hemoglobin in the blood. Getting to your question. The diet has very little to do with creatinine level as creatinine is a toxin and it is only excreted by the kidney. The creatinine level would always stay constant unless more creatinine is excreted. Creatinine can be excreted when one gets dialysis done. In most people, dialysis is attempted with hemodialysis and less often with peritoneal dialysis. It would be a good idea to consult a doctor to discuss using dialysis to control your creatinine levels. However, maintaining a healthy diet and taking good food can help prevent other symptoms of chronic renal disease. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Does she in fact have closure of some or all of her bypass grafts?  Does she have stenosis (narrowing) of any of the bypass grafts?  Those might be treatable with angioplasty ballooning or stenting.  What you describe is \\"diffuse\\" or severe narrowing of the smaller arteries of her heart, or of the distal (farthest-along) parts of her larger coronary arteries.  Those blockages are usually too small or too widespread to treat with balloon or stent catheters.  The way we try to treat those is with a Statin (cholesterol-lowering medication), which she is taking; control of hypertension and diabetes (which the other 2 medicines should do); discontinuation of smoking if that is an issue for her; and sometimes the addition of nitrates (such as Isosorbide) and/or Ranolazine (a medicine that has been shown to decrease shortness of breath with exertion and increase exercise tolerance in people with distal coronary blockages such as your wife's).

Thanks, Pramodh","Doctor":"Hi, 25 years of age and having no history of high blood pressure and diabetes, definitely requires the physician to diagnose the disease properly as some of them are treatable. Your high creatinine levels definitely shows there is some problem. I hope the doctor has given you a diagnosis for the cause of the chronic kidney disease. Young patient commonly at your age can have membranous nephropathy. or it could be a nephritic syndrome. It is advisable to further investigate your condition. Do Peripheral smear, Serum Albumin, Pt/aptt/INR levels, LFT, RFT, Serum electrolytes, Lipid Profile. Urine Routine Examination and Spot Urine ACR are also important. Furthermore, do an ultrasound scan of your kidneys. If required a nephrologist can advise you to do a biopsy. Until you have been properly diagnosed, its very hard to tell the treatment, prognosis and for how long you will take meds. My advise is consult a proper nephrologist.

Only in case of swollen feet, the discomfort could be related to heart failure (considering the fact that it leads to increase fluid retention).If the problem persists, I recommend consulting with your attending physician and performing some tests: - a Doppler ultrasound of the leg vessels to exclude possible peripheral arteriopathy or chronic venous insufficiency- complete blood count, PCR, ESR for inflammation. Hope you will find this answer helpful!Kind regards, Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"greetings from new Zealand. I am an 80 y.o. retired American r.n. now living here.

Mild Puffy eyes and twitching of muscles while in the prone position. With age, the kidney function decreases and if you have blood pressure or hypertension, it add-ons to it and speed up the process. As for twitching is concerned, it is usually associated with calcium levels in the body. Potassium levels usually affect the heart conduction system and magnesium levels may cause muscle weakness and jerky movements. Therefore, it is advisable to go to a physician and do your RFT and Serum Electrolyte levels with Serum calcium and magnesium. Hope I have answered your query.

The surgery was postponed, because the surgeon discovered that the veins to the donor's kidney are very short, requiring that my son's iliac system be lifted to perform the transplant.  My son is overweight and the surgeon said that he needs to loose 20 lbs to make this transplant possible.  He also needs the assistance of another surgeon to do this, who isn't available today.  To compound the situation even more, the nation-wide and local shortage of blood is a concern.  So the stars weren't aligned well for my son today. My question is this: even under ideal circumstances (i.e., his weight was normal), how much more dangerous is such surgery than compared to using a donor kidney having adequate length veins?  I know from my own transplant experience (I was transplanted at age 55 under ideal circumstance), recovery is relatively long and any pressure on the midsection causes great distress.  Additional body fat must not only lengthen the recovery period, but endanger the transplanted kidney. I know there are probably many other factors to consider, but I'm wondering if we should possibly consider another donor or cadaver kidney, if available, with adequate length veins. The surgeon is a vascular specialist and has expressed, optimistically and enthusiastically, that he can perform a successful surgery.  We'll certainly try to talk to him about this, too, but would like to have some preliminary info and/or professional opinions beforehand.  Thanks for your time:)Marc D","Doctor":"Hi, If the donor vein length is low, the transplanted kidney will be under tension and there will be angulation in the veins also. It will compromise already weakened kidneys and chances for rejection will be extremely high in such situations. So it is better to find out a donor with adequate vein length rather than compromising the entire surgery. Wishing you good health. Hope I have answered your query.

Now after two days of fluids in a hospital, her creatinine levels dropped to 4.8 and potassium under normal range 4.5.

Even if Dialysis is done, it will be maintenance one, not thrice a week/lifelong. These are the questions I have: 1)     Dialysis is needed at all? If Creatinine keeps on dropping slowly, even then Dialysis would be required? 2)     If Dialysis is needed, then it will be periodical, lets say monthly or twice a month, once in two months OR thrice weekly/lifelong. 3)     Kidney replacement for her is an option?

There is a probable parapelvic cyst in the upper pole of the left  kidney, measuring 9 mm. There is no hydronephrosis. There is no intra-abdominal ascites. The imaged proximal portions of the aorta and IVC are unremarkable. IMPRESSION Nonobstructing left renal calculi.  No hydronephrosis. Hepatic steatosis.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Your renal scan show that you are having renal stone in  left kidney which is not causing any obstruction in urinary flow, there is nothing serious in this report except a harmless renal stone, no chance of having any renal cancer in this report, if you are not having any lower back pain or recurrent UTI then i would suggest you to get let it go and get your ultrasound repeat after 3 months to see if the renal stone has increased in size or causing and obstruction.

Pain in the lower part of back is not associated with nicotine patch,this pain is either muscular or renal, i would recommend you to get your ultrasound kidney ureters and bladder done to rule out any renal stone that might be causing the pain.

Kidney hematoma are very common after kidney surgery or biopsy, treatment of renal hematoma depends upon the size of hematoma, if it is big enough causing the pressure symptoms over kidney then it should be removed and it can be easily removed by transcutaneous aspiration of hematoma( by passing a large-bore needle through skin).

Your uncle was taking neomercazole for hyperthyroidism and at that time kidney functions tests were normal but now he has stopped taking it so his hyperthyroidism has worsened and hyperthyroidism (elevated thyroid hormone in body) causes almost every organ of the body to hyperfunction which in this case has caused excessive stress onn the kidney which has led to the increase in level of creatinine and urea.

The renal angiogram and serum renin levels explain the cause of resistant hypertension(uncontrolled hypertension despite taking 3 or more antihypertensive drugs)actually the problem in your situation is that the hypoplastic kidney receives lesser blood flow (or lesser blood flow caused hypoplastic kidney) due to which the body thinks that there is overall decrease blood pressure in body as kidney is not getting enough blood this will cause the kidney to release excessive renin which will activate angiotension and aldosterone which are the hormones in the body which cause constriction of blood vessels and retension of salt in body respectively due to which your blood pressure gets very  highremoving hypoplastic kidney will breakdown this cascade and your blood pressure would stay closer to normal valuesthis is a classic case of renovascular hypertension.

Are glucose levels being maintained?So treatment will entirely depend on the cause for kidney injury.My suggestion is please consult nephrologist for more suggestions and management.Hope I have answered your query.

I went to my Dr because I thought that I was menapausal and all my bloods came back good. I asked for a scan as I knew that somethiing wasnt right, I could feel movement and I was always constipated. I had my scan on Wednesday and it showed the kidney cyst as almost treble in size and it had grown 4inches in length. The results were with  my GP the next day (rather quick). I spoke with my GP yesterday and I am  now being referred to Urology and it might be that simple drainage is not enough and that I might loose my kidney. The kidney not be not functioning properly due to the weight of the cyst and it might hav effected my other organs to. Im scared and I woud like advice. Cheryle","Doctor":"Hello,Well, kidney cysts are usually benign and most of the times, they're asymptomatic. Of course, completely removing the kidney is a major procedure but most of the times, a simple trial is given before. Depending on your general conditions and symptoms, the treatment would be done adequately. A cyst so large can be drained using a needle under ultrasound guidance.You do not have to worry a lot about loosing your kidney.

The last few yrs i have experienced several uti s. Most recently i have experienced rt flank pain first thing in the morning. As soon as i empty my bladder the pain is gone. I just finished an antibiotic for a uti. My dr had a renal us. The report read that my rt kidney is fairly inhomogeneous with 5mm cortex thinning. Lt kudney appears norm. The radiologist made a final comment that the rt kidney was quite unusual in appearance and suggested a renogram to evaluate kudney function. Is it possible the kidney looks this way from scar tissue?","Doctor":"Hello,       If you want a brief answer then yes.       As you have mentioned you had history of reflux problem from childhood causing chronic and recurrent UTI. This causes recurrent inflammation leading to scar formation. Also reflux can cause damage to renal parenchyma leading to thinning of cortex. This on USG looks as if kidney is inhomogenous and thinned out, which is as seen exactly in your ultrasound.       Next step in such cases is to do a renogram (DTPA scan) to look how each kidney is functioning. As probablity of right kidney to be nonfunctional is high in such cases. In such patients what is usual practice is to go ahead with nephrectomy to avoid recurrent pain and infection. It all depedns on how symptomatic you are, how second kidney is functioning and are you having any other disease which in later life can affect remaining kidney.       So at this juncture I would suggest you to go ahead with renogram and decide further course afterwords.

Successful Kidney transplants are carried out all over the world today. For any transplant program, the utmost priority is the healthy donor. For kidney donation, firstly you will be thoroughly examined and investigated to look for any subclinical kidney disease or any risk factors (diabetes, HTN) predisposing you to future kidney problems.Now lets assume that you are completely healthy and donate one of your kidneys.Following are the precautions you ought to take in your future1. Routine blood tests ( kidney function, urine)2. Regular monitoring of your blood pressure 3. To avoid any addictions (alcohol, smoking)4. To avoid taking any medications in excess that are harmful for your kidneys (pain killers, nephrotoxic drugs)5. Lastly, remember you will be having a single kidney, so in simple ways if at home you have a electricity shut down, you switch over to back up. In the same way if you have some infection in future, you will have only one kidney to fight. Overall, it is one of the safest organ donations with little surgical or post surger complications till you maintain a healthy lifestyleFeel free to post any further queries Thanks"},{"Patient":"hi i have rheumatoid arthritis but well under control and mobile plus i have pulmonary fibrosis due to the arthritis - my kidneys are very healthy and my husband has a GFR of 20% my blood group matches his and if the tissues match can i be an eligible living donor??","Doctor":"Dear lady, I really appreciate your concern for your husband but there are a few things that you need to considerFirstly, there is no direct effect of RA on kidneys. It does not damage the kidney per se. However, RA is a spectrum of autoimmune diseases where your own antibodies have become your enemy. These antibodies keep causing some amount of vasculitis(inflammation of the blood vessels in body). The vasculitis can also indirectly affect your kidneys to varying extents. Also, pts of RA also are prescribed  NSAIDS which also contribute to kidney damage.The best approach would be to get certain investigations done to assess the present state of your kidneys1. USG to see your kidney architecture 2. Urinanalysis including 24 hr urine protein excretion to asses any initial damage that has begun3. Finally, a DTPA scan to objectively asses the functionality of each of your kidneys. In my opinion, with these three investigations, we will be able to clearly decipher if you can be a donor or notFeel free to post any further queries or get back with test results.Thanks"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

In my opinion your patient is suffering from small contracted kidney which is associated with chronic renal failure. Since kidneys are involved in removing metabolic waste products from the body like urea and maintaining electrolyte balance, it is imperative to maintain such detoxification by dialysis where the function of the kidney is taken over by dialysis machine. If dialysis is not undertaken the wastes in the blood can rise to alarming levels and affect various organs of the body and can cause coma by affecting the brain. The side effects are not of dialysis but actually of kidney failure. So please go ahead. Creatinine above 6 is an indication for immediate dialysis.

The pus cells in the report are not alarmingly high. These few pus cells and rbcs can come from the stone rubbing against the epithelium. Burning pain could be due to the stone or slight infection which is due to stone and obstruction in urine flow. Stones can be formed due to dehydration and low water intake. Sometimes parathyroid secrete high parathormone which increases calcium in blood causing stones. Some stones made of struvite could be due to some ammonia splitting bacteria.

Dear Zubair concretions in the kidneys as such may be incidental finding in some individuals and may be asymptomatic but at the same time may progress to form stones in the kidney which can cause the symptoms you told about. These stones can cause pain and frequent urinary infections. Drink plenty of water to keep kidneys hydrated. Complete your antibiotic course to treat urinary tract infection. For pain you can take diclofenac sodium (Voren) orally. Stones less than 5mm are spontaneously expelled in 90% cases. Remember that Ultrasound cannot pick each and every stone in the ureter. Consult a Urologist if despite taking these measures no improvement seen. He will advise you some more related tests to properly manage the condition."},{"Patient":"Hello Dr. I m 30 weeks pregnant have detected with calculi of 3- 4 mm in both the kidneys. also pus cells with 150- 180/ hpf , protien, bacteria and yeast on 11.08.10 on 12. 07.10 my urine report was pus cell with 25-30 hpf.

However this pain would be constant, severe and not related to any body movement or position.

Amber colored cloudy urine that smells like an outhouse x4 months. 2. Feeling of tightness in area of left kidney x4 days. 3. Sharp stabbing pain in area of left kidney with coughing, sneezing, reaching with left arm across body, etc x4 days. 4. Look and feel like I have gained 20 pounds but scale says there has been no weight gain x4 days. SOCIAL HISTORY:  I am a 48-year-old female who stands 5’2” and weighs 120 pounds.  I have weighed 120 pounds for as long as I can remember.  I am perimenopausal confirmed by lab tests a year ago and possibly have hit menopause as I have not had a period in over two months.  I take Adderall twice a day for ADHD.  I take many vitamins and minerals.  I work at home sitting at the computer 8-12 hours a day.  I wear very loose cloths when working to prevent circulation problems.  I am a social drinker and may have one shot and two beers every three months when I meet friends for drinks.  I am a smoker and smoke a pack of cigarettes per day. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Had kidney infection in March of this year (confirmed with UA), took Bactrim and pain went away, but continued to have dark cloudy urine.  Drinking tons of water and cranberry juice makes urine almost look like water but almost has a greenish tint to it.  On July 5 started Bactrim (did not see doctor, called prescription in) again for a UTI (no pain in kidneys) and had an allergic reaction to the Bactrim on July 8.  Started taking Medrol Dosepak and completed that on July 13.  On July 19, started having muscle spasms from my neck, down left side of back to hip, wrapped around left side toward front but not into the abdomen.  I have had muscle spasm for three months from my scapula on the left side up and into shoulder, arm and clavicle due to a shoulder injury three months ago, but never down into the hip until this past Tuesday.  All muscle spasms are gone today with the exception of what I thought was muscle spasm in the kidney area.  I discovered this evening that if I knock on my ribs with my knuckles over the kidney area, it is very painful.  Have sharp stabbing pain in the kidney area with sneezing, coughing, reaching, quick jerking movement, etc, and have noticed this since Tuesday.  I look like I have gained 20 pounds and my clothes do not fit, but have not gained any weight according to the scale.  This has been within the last few days also. OTHER SYMPTOMS:  Not sure these are related symptoms, but about a week ago I started getting a feeling of an air bubble the size of a nickle in my chest right between my breast slightly to the right that was constant and lasted all day (not painful, just irritating).  Started taking OTC Prilosec and it seems to be starting to work.  Have had symptoms of belching, feel bloated and fat, urine is still not normal since completing the steroids.  Do not believe I have been running a fever, but will start checking that. I am one of those people that does not pay attention to pain unless it is severe and then I start really paying attention.  I am a little worried and would feel better even if you told me it is something serious.  Just not knowing is what drives me crazy.  I plan on calling my doctor on Monday and making an appointment, but wondering if I need to do something sooner.  I do not feel like I am dying.  As long as I do not sneeze, cough, etc, I do not have sharp stabbing pain, just a little feeling of tightness in the kidney area. Thank you – Maggie","Doctor":"Dear Patient, your symptoms are very likely related with an upper urinary tract infection. You reported that antibiotic courses were done previously with benefit, confirm the underlying etiology. However, symptoms are back and urines are still brownish. In this case, I would do first an ultrasound of the kidneys, since a very common cause of relapse of UTI is one or more stones in the pelvis. This is caused by the ability of bacteria of hiding in the irregular surface of stones, forming on it a biofilm that cannot be infiltrated by antibiotics. Meanwhile, you can try with ciprofloxacin, 750 mg day for 10 days (if you do not have contraindications on it). This is very active against E Coli, the commonest pathogen that causes UTI. let me know."},{"Patient":"Hi my dad has problem in his left kidney as its working 22% and right is working 78%.

By the way, I assume the therapy that you took before the renal biopsy was not appropriate to stop rejection. Please report the levels of the drugs are you currently taking. Moreover, report the levels before the renal biopsy and the biopsy report. Then, we will help you to find out if everything is ok.

For the past three years or so, the overt symptom is accelerating, acute compression with me nearly all the time with relief coming only after bed rest. While i can bend without much difficulty, walking is getting increasingly more painful and the slight bending to brush one s teeth, look in the mirror, wash dishes and the like sets off the discomfort immediately! Additionally, three months ago (and for the first time after regular yearly blood workups), a blood test revealed some kidney, per my doctor s brief letter, Slightly impaired kidney function .

So appears this kidney level has remained stable for years. How do I rate ? Dennis","Doctor":"Dear Dennis,you have a decreased renal function, that may be the expression of the aortic valve replacement (increased the risk of cholesterol embolism) and the splenectomy (risk of AKI). Since you are 80 year old, kidneys have a very limited functional reserve. Thus, any clinical condition, like dehydration, may rise sharply your serum creatinine. Thus, be sure to be followed by a good nephrologist and make sure that your physician do not prescribe you nephrotoxic drugs. Avoid NSAIDS, control your blood pressure, limit the salt intake to less than 2 g/day. Moreover, ask your doctor to perform a urinalysis, since renal inflammation (e.g. glomerulonephritis) are frequently observed in older age."},{"Patient":"What are the possible reasons Caucasian hemodialysis patients have a lower health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and higher morbidity rate than African-American hemodialysis patients?

It gives an interstitial granulomatous nephritis that it is pretty evident on renal biopsy, although sarcoid is always an exclusion diagnosis.

Some options for treatment include:Oral corticosteroids. Hydrocortisone (Cortef), prednisone or cortisone acetate may be used to replace cortisol. Your doctor may prescribe fludrocortisone to replace aldosterone.Corticosteroid injections. If you're ill with vomiting and can't retain oral medications, injections may be needed.An ample amount of sodium is recommended, especially during heavy exercise, when the weather is hot or if you have gastrointestinal upsets, such as diarrhea. Your doctor will also suggest a temporary increase in your dosage if you're facing a stressful situation, such as an operation, an infection or a minor illness.TreatmentAn addisonian crisis is a life-threatening situation that results in low blood pressure, low blood levels of sugar and high blood levels of potassium.

Capillaries who were patent previously, become narrow, leading to distal ischemia. In this condition, in order to obtain the right perfusion, heart faces increased resistances, clinically evident as hypertension. At the same time, an ischemic but vital kidney still produces tons of renin that cause hypertension. Anyway, what make me nervous is still a very high pressure in a patient on dialysis. I would suggest to search hints of an ongoing TMA, such LDH, aptoglobin, bilirubin, schistocytes.

However, you should focus your attention to three categories: 1) drugs, as diuretics, because they simply increase the urine output, thus causing a rapid filling of the bladder and finally urgency to urinate; 2) renal insufficiency, since it one of the most important symptoms is nicturia (and IgAN gives, in general, a slowly progressive renal failure if it is not sufficiently controlled by treatment; 3) urine tract infection, although it is rare in male, but became frequent in patients on immunosuppressive drugs (but this I don't know if it applies to you).

People who are healed by HCV virus still have antibodies (thus a positive ELISA) but negative RNA. Thus, I would recommend to do HCVRNA test. Moreover, remember that in many countries public health system is providing for free the treatment for HCV to renal transplant recipients. The final treatment depends on various variables, included viral genotype and degree of renal failure. Thus, make sure you are infected or not, and then we will talk about treatment.

I suppose that the stent was removed by urinary tract. US is helpful to be sure that there is not an ongoing hydroureteronephrosis. Also a complete renal screening (serum creatinine, azotemia, sodium, potassium, calcium and blood gases) is recommended. However, if negative, the pain may be due by the procedure itself which is invasive (remember that urines are acid, and ureter may be a little stretched by the instrument and the stent itself)."},{"Patient":"my son suffring from nephrotic syndrome from last 1.5 month he has been admied for 7 days in hospital as well now he getting swlling on his face medicine are omnacortil 10 and takfa 1 mg (tecrolimus) how much time it will take his urine showing albumin 4+ and rbc 4+","Doctor":"Dear User,it depends on the underlying disease that is giving nephrotic syndrome. In fact, there are diseases, as FSGS, that only raraly goes to remission with zero proteiuria. On the other hand, diseases like membranous nephropathy may be in immunologic remission six months before the disappearance of proteinuria. Conversely, you may see MCD in complete remission after two week on corticosteroids. In general, although total 24h proteinuria is important, what really matters is the disappearance of nephrotic syndrome (serum albumin should be normal)."},{"Patient":"sir i am suffering from a problem of bad breath and smell for past four years,i have consult for a dentist also he told every thing is normal,then whai is the cause for it?my friend told that due 2 the kidney failure it comes is it true?","Doctor":"Dear Patient,sure, this is called uremic breath. This is due by the elimination of some volatile molecules containing azote with the breath. This happens when serum azotemia starts to be high. To be sure about this, please do blood tests searching for serum azotemia. If it is high, you can reduce these symptoms with a low protein diet with or without the supplement of aproteic food.

In fact, the dose you are taking is very low, thus you are on a perfect balance without high levels of immune suppression. Calcineurin inhibitors may be nephrotoxic if blood levels are constantly high (>150 ng/ml) since they cause tubular and endothelial toxicity, leading to tubulo-interstitial scarring, arterial ialinosis and glomerular ischemia. At low doses, calcineurin inhibitors are even protective for the podocytes.

In addition, he states that he feels too weak to work in the brief time periods he has between all the drinking and the urinating You collect urine and blood samples from Mr. Mendez and the lab results are as follows: urine osmolality is 150 mOsm/kg (this means that the urine is very dilute) blood osmolality is 300 mOsm/kg (this means that the blood is very concentrated) QUESTION: What hormone is involved in triggering water retention in the kidneys?","Doctor":"Dear user, please dose blood vasopressin (ADH). The clinical pattern is very consistent for a deficit of central production. Moreover, I would recommend a cerebral MRI to exclude compression by expansive lesions or ischemia.Let me updated,Andrea"},{"Patient":"I am a 43 year old healthy female who developed a UPJ obstruction with severe hydronephrosis and a severely enlarged right kidney. During a ureteroscopy it was found that my kidney was completely blocked and I ended up with a nephrostomy tube and was scheduled for a pyeloplasty a month later.  I developed high blood pressure and sinus tachycardia (150-160) while still in the hospital. I have always been healthy up to this point and have always had low blood pressure and low heart rate.  I was placed on Metoprolol while still in the hospital,which worked well.  However, I had an anaphylactic reaction which required inubation and ventilator. I was taken off of Metoprolol (since it interferes with epinephrine) and placed on Norvasc.  I am now home and still have a stent in place which will be removed in 2 1/2 weeks from now.  My B/P is still very high and my resting HR is 100. Minimal activity raises my HR to 120-150.  Is this due to my kidney issues?","Doctor":"Difficult to say without seeing you. Often, high frequencies are observed in patients with an ongoing infection. I would suggest a urine culture and urinalysis, CBC and CRP. I suppose you are not on medications that may justify your symptoms. Do a thyroid screen. Let me know,Andrea"},{"Patient":"My wife is 28 years old and has just been dignosed with this MCD.  She was on a selection of drugs but when being reduced in concentration she relasped.  How long can it take to recover?  Can you beat this?  Can you relapse once you have been cleared?","Doctor":"Dear user,in general minimal change disease is a very responsive disease, especially to steroids. If it does not, there is something wrong. First, the problem may be a too rapid tapering. Second, renal biopsy often cannot rule out an FSGS, which is a podocitopathy as MCD, but much more resistant. Third, make sure your nephrologist did a screening of secondary causes, which are many, and may explain this kind of resistance. Fourth, there are a number of second line approaches, in particular cyclosporine, which may be effective in steroid resistant forms. Fifth, you need lot of patience...make sure to reduce salt and liquid intake, reduce protein intake to less than 1 g/kg/day and have a daily weight in order to avoid fluid excess. Avoid NSAIDs and every nephrotoxic drug.Best regards,Andrea"},{"Patient":"My friend has problem of excessive protein around his heart and kidneys which cause him great difficulty in breathing.

Could the excessive use of ibuprophen n the kidney infection be the reason i got my period early n really heavy","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to Healthcaremagic. Thank you for your query. Well, I dont think this is related to ibuprofen or kidney issue.Heavy periods are common women issue and there are many possible reasons which include: Hormone problems. Every month, a lining builds up inside your uterus (womb), which you shed during your period. If your hormone levels aren’t balanced, your body can make the lining too thick, which leads to heavy bleeding when you shed the thicker lining. Second, growths in the uterus  such as polyps or fibroids are benign (non-cancerous) tumors that grow within the uterus.While some causes may be easy to treat, others can indicate a serious underlying condition. Whether you notice spotting or heavier bleeding in between periods, it’s important to see your doctor for testing, diagnosis, and treatment options. Other potential other  causes of bleeding  include stress,  change in medications,  miscarriage, vaginal dryness. Your doctor will also likely give you a physical exam, including a pelvic exam and test your hormonal levels. This will show us exact issue which can be treated then.I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time"},{"Patient":"By accident a relative took 600mg of Clindamycin 4 times a day for three days how can this affect her liver or kidneys?

If you have any doubts you can do blood urea and creatinin to see if kidneys work well. In some cases if this become constant or new smells occur,then you should see ENT doctor since it may sometimes indicate problems with nose and sinus infections or olfactory nerve issues.

Thank you for your query. I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can.No, this is not something that you should worry about since this is normal variation of kidneys size and two kidneys are never the same size. Only if this is larger than 14cm or smaller than 6 cm it may indicate some diosrders. Also it will not affect your blood pressure unless there is some parenchimal kindeys disorder and for that to evaluate, the size itself would not be sufficient. YOu should do additional:1. Doppler ultrasound and blood flow measuremnet2. Blood urea and creatining3. Holter blood pressure measurement.These tests will show if blood pressure is determined by kidneys or heart function and then you ll have more info about how to treat it.I hope I have answered you query.

Thank you for your queryMost small stones in patients  can be treated with observation and acetaminophen or other painkillers. More serious cases with intractable pain may require drainage with a stent or percutaneous nephrostomy. In cases of emergency, treatment of nephrolithiasis involves management of renal (ureteral) colic, including surgical interventions where indicated, and medical therapy for stone disease. In emergency settings where concern exists about possible renal failure, the focus of treatment should be on correcting dehydration, treating urinary infections, preventing scarring and identifying patients with a solitary functional kidney.Kindly regards.

Because, life is more important than prostate. As simple as that. And definitely,there will be chances of MI, heart attack once he stops those medications. Generally, forget about 3 days gap, even after few years, we surgeons take opinion from cardiologist or at least a physician on stopping of such drug and then, go operate.

Sometimes I feel a sharp pain or like a pulling in my life side, not near my ovaries, but further up and toward my back. It is worse when I sit down.

He returned home with the doctors still not knowing what exactly was wrong. At this point  they ruled out the failure part although his kidneys are not putting out the way they should they are still functioning. He returned to ER 3 days after being released due to vomiting. They stablized it and sent him home again. Now he has no appitite and most times cannot even keep down water. I try not to let him take his medication unless he eats, which he does not, so he is not taking his meds. We went to his doctor yesterday where they determined he was dehydrated so they put him on a IV for 3 hours. We left the hospital stopped for bottled water where he then vomited again. Is there something he can take to maybe coat his stomach to help keep things down?","Doctor":"Hello, As per your description your husband is suffering from some kidney disease. But it's unclear wether it is Acute Kidney Injury(AKI) or Chronic Kidney disease(CKD). Because AKI is temporary and more serious than CKD. But vomiting is a very common condition in any disease. In kidney diseases, recurrent vomiting are common due to Uremia(increase serum urea). This will also lead to loss of appetite. In your case, you have to find out the extent of kidney damage and cause of vomiting by some tests like USG abdomen pelvis, KFT and ABG with Serum Phosphoric level. Meanwhile better get admitted the patient and start IVF with washout urea if increased. As much as put on more injectables rather than oral. So don't be panic and evaluate the patient properly and treat with injections for few days and get down serum urea level if increased by diuretics or dialysis if needed.Thank you"},{"Patient":"Hello...I was diagnosed with Glomerulonephritis in 1992 - no history of kidney disease in family at all - career has been in an office - was in Viet Nam and was exposed to Agent Orange - question: is it at least possible that my kidney failure was caused by exposure to the chemicals found in Agent Orange?

As your one report suggestive of proteinurea. But according to your description, it's transient. Generally transient or intermittent proteinurea is a common condition called orthostatic proteinurea means protein loss with postural variation. This is normal physiological condition and not to be worry about it. But you also mentioned pain in bilateral flank region also and you are hypertensive along with taking of steroids. These all are high risk conditions for protein loss. So you should be evaluated thoroughly wather this is physiological protein loss or pathological. You get Urine protein creatinine ratio and 24 hours urine test to decide the severity of protein loss. This will also help to find out the cause of protein loss. If both reports come inconclusive then better go for USG abdomen for kidney size and other pathology. And after then go for kidney biopsy to find out the exact pathology.

When kidney function decrease less than 30% then dialysis is the mainstay of treatment to washout the toxic products. But dialysis is not the cure of this disease. In fact, dialysis only helps to improve your quality of life and decrease the morbidity. According to your description, you are too young to develop this disease. Generally this disease occurs in some high risks like Diabetes, Hypertension, connective tissue disorders.As your blood pressure is high but CKD itself leads to high blood pressure so your medication is good according to your disease. If BP is more than 140/90 then increase your Tab Arkamin 0.1 mg thrice a day.So there will be two approaches. First to manage regular dialysis to keep your serum creatinine lower side along with improved quality of life. Second is to find out the exact cause for CKD in this young age and treatment according to that. And for future, if possible then think of kidney transplant also for permanent treatment or in your word for cure of this disease.

Sometimes due to inflammatory response of body show temperature. In your case, the Kidney infection could be the main cause of fever. But you also mentioned the TLC count was very low initially. This low count itself causes fever called neurogenic fever. Mostly seen in chemotherapy induced or in Maliganancy. In your case, it may be due to antibiotics. As you asked about duration of fever regarding kidney disease. Actually it depends on the type of pathology in kidney. The infection in kidney for prolonged time itself is a very high risk condition. Because this will lead to damage if kidney irreversibly and patient may developed chronic kidney disease and dialysis. Or may sometimes this infection spread all over body called sepsis and may be life threatening. So proper work up is necessary to find out the extant of kidney infection and to find out exert pathology with organisms. So that proper treatment should be initiated according to severity and specificity of antibiotics depends on organism.So go for CT Abdomen for Exetent of damage and Urine culture for sepecific organism and specific drug to cure this infection. In this case better start Clindamycin and antigungal drugs also to cover the spectrum.

Please type your query here...","Doctor":"Hi, Your father may be suffering form Chronic kidney disease or Diabetic Nephropathy. This is an irreversible disease and you have to go for regular dialysis to improve the quality of life. Bit it's not a permanent solution for your father. The most important aspect is blood sugar. you must control your father's blood sugar level (fasting 80-110 mg/dl and after meal 130-160). For this you have to start with Inj. Insulin preferably. Because Drug is not kidney safe fully. After then you think about kidney transplant because dialysis is not the cure. Till then continue the dialysis and control the blood sugar level.Thank you"},{"Patient":"My father has diabetes which has decreased his kidney functions. If I undergo all the necessary process that is required of a donor, and shown compatible with his blood type; I exercise on regular basis would a transplant limit me from high intensity exercises?","Doctor":"Hello... My sympathies for the difficult situation you are in.After a kidney transplant, the donors remaining kidney takes over the function of both the kidneys so as to speak.Which means you have double the amount of blood flowing through it and double the amount of load that it needs to filter. The solitary kidney adapts to this need by undergoing an enlargement in size or hypertrophy.You should be able to maintain a normal lifestyle after the procedure. But you need to keep in mind that you will be at greater risk for diseases such as hypertension ,anemia and osteodystrophy in the future. It would be better to avoid anything which would overload the solitary functioning kidney.(painkillers, high intake of salt and protein )It would be advisable that you maintain a healthy lifestyle and get a moderate amount of exercise, not high intensity on most days of the week.Hope this helps,Regards..."},{"Patient":"sir, my father is siffering kidney problem since 2 years. he has treated in AIIMS, PGI, and now treatment is going in CMC vellore. dr. has told that there is kidney infection and there is need of transplant as soon as possible , but prior to transplant we want consultant with other renound hospital so kindly give me suggestion that what should we do at this stage.","Doctor":"Hello,There are many indications for kidney transplant. In which infection of kidney is one of the cause. But infection is a vague term to describe the condition because infection generally affects one kidney. And if one kidney is involved then there is no need of kidney transplant if another one is working normally. So in your question, the exact picture is not clear regarding infection. You didn't mention regarding any prior history of Diabetes or Hypertension or any other kidney disease. you also didn't mention wather patient on dialysis or not. But according to your description, if all renounced institutes advised kidney transplant after seeing your father illness regarding infection of kidney, it means both kidneys are not working properly and there is a chance of sepsis that itself harm the body fatally. So my advice is go for transplant if there is no chance of saving of kidney or if there is life threatening condition.Thank you"},{"Patient":"my blood test shows in test values cholesterol     198 mg/dl HDL-C           49  mg/dl LDL-C           130 mg/dl VLDL            19  mg/dl LDL/HDL RATIO   2.60 TRIGLYCERIDES   95  mg/dl LIPIDS          825 mg/dl glucose         96 Now problem is this the LDL_C is showing 130 wich is high when its normal values are between 30-100.I test it from zeenat lab lawrence road lahore as a pre-cationary measure.now i want to decrese ldl-c to normal valuei  very keen to do it if you can help me i will appriciate your advice. thank you very much. regards","Doctor":"bhai ...reduce fast foods ...nonvegetarian foods .fried foods ...avoid ghee butter sweets ...and go for morning walk ...do these things for a month ...you will see results ...but if these donot give results nect option is statin drugs as atorvastatin"},{"Patient":"hi. doc! i am emelia codjoe from ghana west africa, accra to be precise. i was diagnosed of mildly dilation of a calyses in my left kidney. i was put on lysinopril for almost two years now. i sometimes does'nt feel the pains at times too it becomes more serious. please help me is there any medicine to cure it? i am 40 years and will be 41 in september 2010. thank you. waiting to here from you. bye","Doctor":"Hi Emelia and welcome to HCM.As an Urologist, i can understand your anxiety.Mild dilatation of the calyces,isn't something to worry about.Lisinopril is being given to control high blood pressure.Drink about ten glasses fluids daily.Repeat the scan after 6 months, to check if there's any change.Wish you well.

There was still hydronephrosis but doctor could not locate the calculi. I am not on any treatment now. What should I do now?","Doctor":"Hello,Stone in proximal ureter most of time leads to hydronephrosis due to back pressure. But if hydronephrosis prolongs for longer time then it can harm the kidney too.As per your description, now no stone is visible but hydronephrosis persists after homeopathic treatment. It means, still there is a stone there which is not visualised due to inflammation or any other cause. So better you consult some Urologist and get an CT urography done for exact pathology. If there is regular pain or hydronephrosis continues then better you go for intervention.Thank you"},{"Patient":"Iam 46,male .

I am not a regular alcohol user. Stpt is 80 and bilrubin is 1. Pl. advise me about treatment for this.","Doctor":"Hello,As per your description, there is no high risk factor associated with your kidney stone. And you monitored the stone size with time that became small compared to previous one. The tiny size of stone doesn't cause any harm to your kidney. And there is no allopathic medicine to wash out these stone.So don't be panic and just take some precautions like don't eat Tomatos and spinech too much and take plenty of water. As far as for your liver concern, mildly raised SGPT doesn't cause any harm. Abd it will be better with time.Gardually your stone will be washed out with urine with time. If pain occur then take some analgesic meanwhile.Thank you"},{"Patient":"hi, my mother undergo dialysis for almost a month... her friend advised her to take medicine(I dont know the product) after a week she realized that her kidney begun functioning well because she is able to pass urine many urine as normal like she has no failure in her kidney, if this condition continue, is it possible or Ok for her to stop her dialysis?","Doctor":"Hello, Kidney disease are classified broadly in two types on the basis of dialysis. One is Acute Kidney Injury(AKI). Anothe is chronic kidney disease(CKD). In AKI either no need of dialysis or required for some specific period of dialysis. But in CKD, you have to dialyse the patient at regular interval throughout.As in your case it's difficult to find out. But if you required more than a month of dialysis, it means probably your mother is suffering from CKD. In CKD, indication of dialysis is not only depends  on urine output. There are so many factors which decide dialysis: Urine output, serum urea and creatinine level, serum potassium level, clinical symptoms and signs like breathlessness, swelling of whole body, loss of appetite.So only urine output, you can not decide the requirement of dialysis. As far as medicine concern, in my opinion Drugs are very necessary for CKD patients but if patient needs dialysis then there is less likely chance that patient can be controlled only in medicines without dialysis.So my advise is consult nearest Nephrologist and get a KFT done and watch for above symptoms and sign, if anything come positive then do dialysis. Thank you"},{"Patient":"MY FATHER 62 YEARS OLD HE KIDNEY PROBLEM RECENTLY WE HAD UNDERTREATMENT OF DR. SK SINGH VARANASI BUT NOW HE HAS PROBLEM DROWSY HE IS SLEEPING ONLY. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM NOW. HE HAS BLOOD PRESSURE AND WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW DUE TO BLOOD PRESSURE HIS KIDNEY HAS GOT DAMAGE.","Doctor":"Hi, The blood pressure and kidney disease are raceprocative to each other. Blood pressure is a major risk factor to damage the kidney if it is uncontrolled for long time. Simultaneously if any one developed kidney disease then his blood pressure gradually rises.In kidney disease, there are several factors those cause drowsiness. Most common is Uremia means high Blood urea level. Another one is Metabolic acidosis means increase acid production in body due to disturb metabolism. Third one is high blood pressure called hypertensive encephalopathy. 4th factor is sepsis means some infection in body. so in your case, you have to investigate properly to find out the exact cause of drowsiness. And then treatment according to cause. So you just get CBC, KFT, Urine Routine and ABG in first spell. Then next tests will be decided according to report.So don't wait and get hurry to do all because drowsiness is a important and high risk symptom in kidney disease.Thank you"},{"Patient":"Son is 26yrs old, and caught a cold/flu? friday night.  sunday night we took him to the hospital to find out he had kidney stones. they gave him pain medication and today we saw his regular doctor who gave him antibiotics for his cold.

Should we be worried? is there something we can do that will make the fever go away?","Doctor":"Hello,As per your description, your son might be suffering from Urinary Tract Infection. As he developed fever with rigor followed by sweating along with stone in kidney. So he may have infection in urine that causes fever. First of all, get some tests done to confirm like Urine routine microscopy with Urine culture sensitivity. Along with that kindly rule out other causes of fever like Malaria and Typhoid.According to report, treat the patient with proper antibiotics. If it's UTI then better you start Tab Nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice a day with Crocin 650 mg sos for 7 days.And for renal stone, don't be panic. If stone size is less than 10 mm then better treat conservatively and give plenty of water.

You should change or upgrade the medicine to control blood pressure.Meanwhile your creatinine level is a little bit high but you didn't mention the level. Generally serum creatinine level less or equal to 1.4 is considered normal. If creatinine is higher than 1.4 then you have to investigate properly to find out wather it's temporary or permanent. Temporarily due to so many causes, serum creatinine level varies so don't be panic and find out the cause and treat according to that. But if it's permanent then better you go for USG abdomen for kidney size along with urine albumin test. If both comes positive then it means there is kidney disease and you have to careful for your diet, habit, addiction and regular drug intake. but most important is control of blood pressure less than 140/90.So first of all control your BP less than 140/90 along with diet and exercise modifications then investigate properly to rule out any kidney damage and regular watch for your serum creatinine level.Thank you"},{"Patient":"kidney n stone  doctor i am vipul m 28 i hve stone pain on my left .. did x ray c.x ray and ultrsound too but did not find shap n size doctor said it is stone n i have heavy pain for last 3days what will be cost of kvp scan now what i do YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hi Vipul,As an Urologist, i can understand your anxiety.If your doctor suspects a stone,then the best single test is a plain CT scan.The CT scan will confirm or rule out a stone and changes in the kidney.According to the report, an expert advise can be given.For the pain,you can take some pain killer tablets or injection.Cost of the scan varies from place to place.Wish you a speedy recovery.Dr.Matthew J.

Now he is ok but we are planning to get surgery done asap.Kindly let me know if sunflower oil, chapatis made of wheat, foods like rice, rajma, potatoes and maida (white flour) are ok for him. Should I give him chapatis made of bajra instead of wheat?","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to HCM, sorry to know the status of your husband. Gall bladder stones are of more concern than kidney. But again depends on size. Most important things to be noted. 1. There are different causes for gall bladder and kidney stones. 2. Size and function matters in the management. Need further details. 3. Both are not a major problem and can be effectively managed, so don't worry. 4. And there are various management strategies for kidney stones but for gall bladder stones, best treatment is cholecystectomy which means removal of gall bladder. All the food stuff that you have mentioned have no propensity for gall bladder or renal stones. So chill. The most important cause of gall bladder stones is  due to super saturation of bile juice. Most of the times we have no control over it to avoid. And kidney there are few things to avoid. 1. Drink lots of water, around 4 litres daily 2. Avoid junk food, high salt intake. 3. Reduce meat consumption if any. Hope this helps and you are welcome to ask any further queries.

Sorry to hear that from you. Basically you are suffering from renal or ureteric or bladder calculus. Need few details as 1. Is scan done? Usg or CT scan2. Your age Anyway, the complaints that you are telling are true. It happens due to ureteric calculus because various nerves are involved in that process. Depending on the location of stone, you experience pain all the way to thighs and sometimes leg as you mentioned. So do not panic or worry. Please take medications when you have pain. Take tablet ultracet. And you should recover well. Drink lot of water. If pain continues, go for CT or USG scan to know the status of remaining calculus if any.

Starting from a month back, I can feel dull pain (like pressures) on kidney area (back waist and sometime sides waist area) after sleeping for around 5hrs onwards at night. However, no issue during Daytime or when I'm not lying down. I also feel that I have a little shorter tolerance for urine management (when i feel the urge to visit the loo, it's usually already at a quite urgent stage. This is not my usual self. Could this be any potential medical issue that needs attention or maybe just aching due to a less active lifestyle? Thank you for your attention.P.S: I've no prior kidney or bladder issue. Currently under medical treatment (Iressa) for lung cancer and was told that this drug doesn't cause any side effect on other organs.","Doctor":"hi, As per your description it seems like some bladder incontinence which is very mild. Actually at night time we don't void frequently so there is pressure build up in bladder after 5-6 hours and due to some incontinence, there is a urgency in urination that cause some discomfort in kidney area due to back pressure. there is nothing much to worry about.

You definitely feel some relief.thank you"},{"Patient":"Hello, my father had axcel bi femeral bypass surgery to get rid of an infection.  This caused acute kidney failure.  His Creatinine level was up to 4.9 ish. He has been on dialisis several times now with his levels bearly moving after each treatment.  He is currently at 3.7.  He is also in congestive heart failure.  At what point would he need to have a transplant if his levels don't get undercontrol?","Doctor":"hi, kidney disease is broadly classified as two types. Acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. In AKI, the chances of long term dialysis is less and patient recovers with time with normal kidney function. But in CKD, patient is on regular hemodialysis for long time or frankly say for life time. In that condition, we should consider about Kidney transplant. Because dialysis is not a cure, it only prolongs the life expectancy along with some patient well being. So for permanent cure, you have to think about kidney transplant. But kidney transplant is not so easy process. before it a battery of investigations are done to find out how is the risk benefit ratio. If all important factors are favourable then we proceed for transplant. In your case, one major risk is Heart so first of all cardiologist asses the heart function and then he will tell you about how risky is this process?there is no specific criteria for creatinine level for transplant. If creatinine level is stable without dialysis and patient has no symptoms then better you can wait for transplant. But if he needs regular dialysis to control creatinine level then better you think for transplant. Heart failure patient can be taken for transplant if he has good ejection fraction.So you can go for kidney transplant if he has CKD with good ejection fraction of heart.thank you"},{"Patient":"I am a 61 year old female.  I am a teacher of little children so I am active enough.  I could probably lose a few pounds, but am not seriously over-weight.  I donated a kidney 3 years ago and in the last year have had a lower GFR 43.  Creatinine has been mildly up but in the normal range.  I went to a renal specialist and after a 24 hour urine they said my GFR is more in the range of 69.  They said to come back if I experienced high Creatinine and that the lower blood GFR could be due to more muscle than the typical woman of my age.  My internist says not to worry, but it is hard not to.  I never thought about GFR before!!  I try to drink enough water but often fall very short on this.  Could dehydration be the cause and am I able to raise my GFR?  Feeling good in all aspects, no meds or NSAIDS-just occasional Tylenol, take vitamins, normal activity, no diabetes or high blood p.  Just arthritis.Not a drinker.  Advice to move on take care of self and not worry?","Doctor":"hi, single kidney is sufficient to do routine work. So first of all no worry regarding single kidney. Another good thing is you have no other high risk factor.But if you feel some pain in renal area that subsided after drinking, it means you may be suffering from some small stone or UTI.So you go for USG  abdomen along with urine microscopy. If both come negative then it may be due to dehydration only and you should be aware about your hydration. Because when proper urine output is there then automatically eGFR increases. So if transient reduction in your eGFR then not to worry about it. Another thing I want to tell you regarding analgesic use. As you mentioned that you have arthritis. It means you may be taking some analgesic regularly. If so, then please reduce the dose or stop it or change it to kidney safe analgesic drugs to save your single kidney.So go for some test, drink as much as you can and avoid analgesic use.thank you"},{"Patient":"My Mum has been diagnosed with an anurism on her kidneys...4.1.

Are all these symptoms normal a year after my surgery.","Doctor":"hiyou have written a lot of problems but very vague pattern. I think all problems are not related with hysterectomy. After hysterectomy weight gain can occur due to hormonal imbalance. And due to weight gain your knees must be aching because of loss of fluid of knees. Due to some kidney problem and stenting, you may suffering from UTI so do urine microscopy and urine culture to confirm. if come positive then will treat UTI. Another issue is insomnia. I think it's may be due to your obesity. Obesity causes Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome(OSAS). this cause ineffective sleep and excessive lethargy due to lac of sleep and co2 retention. so I advise you to do sleep study and if it comes positive then apply Bipap.

You developed two tubes (ureter) from the kidney to the urinary bladder where there should only be one. Usually the abnormal tube has an abnormal function and displaced end at the bladder. This abnormal collecting system is obstructed NCR birth and accumulates urine and no way for the urine to come out properly that is why it would cause swelling, stone formation and possibly UTIs.

Usually UTI can be a common infection during pregnancy. Most of these infections are limited to the bladder and urethra,but sometimes they can lead to a kidney infection. If they do, UTI  may lead to preterm labor. What I suggest in this situation is doing a urine test (as you have done),urine culture to see what kind of bacteria is, and full blood count and azotemia /creatinemia(renal function) to exclude a kidney infection. For the moment,you should  taking antibiotic as above mentioned (usually I prescribe ampicillin or amoxicillin during pregnancy), drink a lot of water and after you finished the antibiotic should do an other urine test to see the improvement. I hope my answer help you. I wish a quick recovery."},{"Patient":"I have a son who is twelve years old.  He started having back pain.

Now I have chronic lower left back pain.  Never had back problems before the lithotripsies.  Walking or just standing for more than 15 minutes makes the pain worse.  Laying down on my right side sometimes helps temporarily relieve the pain.  I still have several  4-5 mm kidney stones in my left kidney.  My urologist says the pain isn't from the kidney stones and I shouldn't have pain months after lithotripsy.  Yet there isn't anything wrong with my spine and I'm very careful not to injure my back.  What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Most small stones in patients with relatively mild hydronephrosis can be treated with observation and acetaminophen. More serious cases with intractable pain may require drainage with a stent or percutaneous nephrostomy. Treatment of nephrolithiasis involves emergency management of renal (ureteral) colic, including surgical interventions where indicated, and medical therapy for stone disease. In emergency settings where concern exists about possible renal failure, the focus of treatment should be on correcting dehydration, treating urinary infections, preventing scarring, and identifying patients with a solitary functional kidney.

Looks something like quartz but a orange yellow color. Sorry cant give exact color because i am color deficient.","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM.Most small stones in patients with relatively mild hydronephrosis can be treated with observation and acetaminophen. More serious cases with intractable pain may require drainage with a stent or percutaneous nephrostomy. Treatment of nephrolithiasis involves emergency management of renal (ureteral) colic, including surgical interventions where indicated, and medical therapy for stone disease.In emergency settings where concern exists about possible renal failure, the focus of treatment should be on correcting dehydration, treating urinary infections, preventing scarring, identifying patients with a solitary functional kidney,.Kindly regards.

Thank you for your query. I am Dr. Rommstein, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can.This may be is caused by urinary infection including kidneys infection or urinary stones so you should do urine analysis, urinoculture and kidneys ultrasound to rule these out which are most common causes. You should drink raspberry tea and plenty of water till you do tests. You should reduce salt in your diet as well, alcohol and carbonated drinks. In most cases this is self limiting but sometimes antibiotics are required and more invasive tests such as cystoscopy or pyelography or CT scan. Less common causes include tumors, glomerulonephritis and metabolic diseases.I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time.Kindly regards.

What are the long term effects of hydronephrosis will my kidneys go back to normal once they figure it what exactly is causing the obstruction. Will i have permanent damage and are there any precautions  that i should be taking i know to drink lots of water but what else should i be doing. they also told me i have severe chronic cystitis and i am currently taking antibiotics. i have two small children i want to make sure that i will still be able to take care of them . is my condition serious or is something that once i get treatment for the obstruction i will go back to normal.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM. As an Urologist,i can understand your concern.The cause for the hydronephrosis can be found out,once the stents are out.You should've written your age and what medication you're on.Usually the stents are placed after knowing status of kidney function and cause of the hydronephrosis.You've not written reports done so far.You'll need to do blood routine,RBS,creatinine,LFT and urine routine and culture. After that do a CT-IVU,if the kidney function is normal.Send the reports here and an expert opinion can be given.Dr.Matthew J.

Urinalysis showed infection as UTI possible kidney infection.  Dr. gave antibiotics and pain meds.  I feel much better, however I still have a little pain in the same site as described above and my left calf muscle feels very sore.  Is this normal?","Doctor":"hi and pleased to answer youyou are suffering from acute pyelonephritis. and the re-evaluation of the treatment is essential at the 48th-72nd hour and at D7, to check the quality of the initial prescription of the antibiotics (chosen molecule, dosage) and to adapt it to clinical and antibiogram (check the absence of adverse effects). Follow-up is initially clinical (disappearance of fever and disappearance of lower back pain). The realization of a systematic urinalysis to ensure the disappearance of germs is controversial. For some, an urinalysis is not necessary in case of disappearance of the clinical signs. For others, a systematic urinalysis is recommended 1 week and 4 to 6 weeks after cessation of treatment or just 4 to 6 weeks after discontinuation of treatment. If clinical signs persist or if worsening occurs beyond 48 to 72 hours, a new clinical, biological evaluation and radiological (renal CT) is recommended. Imaging looks for an unnoticed obstacle, pyonephrosis, renal abscess, perirenal collection.
