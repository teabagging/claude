We deduce thatf(2 x+a)=f(f(2 x))=f(x+a)+xand, if we set x=-a, it follows that f(-a)=f(0)-a=0.We then consider an arbitrary real number x, and we set y=-f(-2 x)-a and z=-x+f(y). Since f(-a)=0, the equation mathbf{E}(-x, y) shows that f(z)-x=f(-a)=0, that is, f(z)=x. The function f is therefore surjective.Let us prove that f is also injective. Let x and y be two real numbers such that f(x)=f(y), and let d=y-x. Let t be an arbitrary real number, and let z be a preimage of t by f. The equations mathbf{E}(z / 2, x) and mathbf{E}(z / 2, y) show thatf(t+x)=f(f(2 z / 2)+x)=f(z / 2+f(x))+z / 2=f(z / 2+f(y))+z / 2=f(t+y)If d neq 0, this means that f is d-periodic, which proves that f(2 x)=f(2 x+2 d)=f(2 y) and that f(x+a)=f(x+a+d)=f(y+a). But then the equation mathbf{E}(x, 0) indicates thatx=f^{2}(2 x)-f(x+a)=f^{2}(2 y)-f(y+a)=ycontradicting the fact that d neq 0.The function f is therefore indeed injective.

This secures a score of at least 39 (from (3) ) less (9 times 1) (from (1) and (2) ).

Now suppose that the second player plays (20, a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n}) (where (left.1 leq n leq 9right)) which require a reply under (4). The reason (a_{1}) required a move under (4) was that (a_{1}-1) or (a_{1}+1) was the 1 st player's response to 20. Similarly, the reason (mathrm{a}_{2}) required a move under (4) was that (mathrm{a}_{2}-) 1 or (mathrm{a}_{2}+1) was the 1 st player's response to (mathrm{a}_{2}), and so on. Thus the increment to the absolute value from these moves is at most (left|20-a_{1}+1right|+left|a_{1}-a_{2}+1right|+ldots+left|a_{n-1}-a_{n}+1right|+left|a_{n}right|=20+n). The increment from the moves under (2) and (3) is ((9-mathrm{n})) x 1 , and the increment from the move under (1) is 1 . Hence the maximum absolute value is 30 .Since the 1 st player has a strategy to do no worse than 30 and the 2 nd player has a strategy to do no worse than 30 , these strategies must actually be optimal.section*{1st ASU 1967}"},{"problem":"Given that overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} are unit vectors, and (2overrightarrow{a}+ overrightarrow{b})cdot (overrightarrow{a}-2overrightarrow{b})=- frac {3 sqrt {3}}{2}, then the angle between vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} is ( ).A:  frac {pi}{6}B:  frac {pi}{4}C:  frac {3pi}{4}D:  frac {5pi}{6}","solution":"Let the angle between vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} be theta,Since overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} are both unit vectors,Therefore, |overrightarrow{a}|=|overrightarrow{b}|=1, overrightarrow{a}cdot overrightarrow{b}=cos theta,Given that (2overrightarrow{a}+ overrightarrow{b})cdot (overrightarrow{a}-2overrightarrow{b})=- frac {3 sqrt {3}}{2},Therefore, 2|overrightarrow{a}|^{2}-2|overrightarrow{b}|^{2}-3overrightarrow{a}cdot overrightarrow{b}=-3cos theta=- frac {3 sqrt {3}}{2},Thus, cos theta= frac {sqrt {3}}{2},Since 0leqslant thetaleqslant pi,Therefore, theta= frac {pi}{6},Hence, the correct choice is: boxed{A}By setting the angle between vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} as theta and using the formula for the dot product of vectors along with the given equation (2overrightarrow{a}+ overrightarrow{b})cdot (overrightarrow{a}-2overrightarrow{b})=- frac {3 sqrt {3}}{2}, we can find the solution.This problem tests the formula for the dot product of vectors and is considered a basic question."},{"problem":"314. a) Two tangents are drawn to a given circle.

Let triangle K L M be given (see figure).

From the given information, we know:   [   x_5 = 43   ]   Therefore, by the definition of the sequence:   [   x_5 = 1 + x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4   ]   This implies:   [   43 = 1 + x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4 implies x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4 = 42   ]3. Next, we need to find ( x_6 ):   [   x_6 = 1 + x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4 x_5   ]   Substituting the known values:   [   x_6 = 1 + 42 cdot 43   ]   Calculate the product:   [   42 cdot 43 = 1806   ]   Therefore:   [   x_6 = 1 + 1806 = 1807   ]4. Now, we need to find the prime factors of 1807. We start by checking divisibility by smaller prime numbers:   - 1807 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.   - The sum of the digits of 1807 is (1 + 8 + 0 + 7 = 16), which is not divisible by 3, so 1807 is not divisible by 3.   - 1807 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.   - Check divisibility by 7:     [     1807 div 7 approx 258.14 quad text{(not an integer, so not divisible by 7)}     ]   - Check divisibility by 11:     [     1807 div 11 approx 164.27 quad text{(not an integer, so not divisible by 11)}     ]   - Check divisibility by 13:     [     1807 div 13 = 139 quad text{(exact division, so 1807 = 13 cdot 139)}     ]5. The prime factors of 1807 are 13 and 139. The largest prime factor is 139.6. Finally, we find the sum of the digits of 139:   [   1 + 3 + 9 = 13   ]The final answer is (boxed{13})."},{"problem":"20.

Assuming m neq 0, the discriminant must be zero: (8km)^2 - 4 cdot (4k^2 + 3) cdot (4m^2 - 12) = 0.  Therefore, 4k^2 - m^2 + 3 = 0. Let's call this equation (3).  At this point, x_0 = frac {x_{1}+x_{2}}{2} = -frac{4km}{4k^{2}+3} = -frac{4k}{m}, and y_0 = kx_0 + m = frac{3}{m}.  So the point T is (-frac{4k}{m}, frac{3}{m}).

Therefore, we can equate the power of x in the given expression to 3, which gives us:[n = 3]Next, since the expression is a binomial, it means it consists of two terms. The term left(m-1right)x indicates the coefficient of x which should not vanish for the expression to remain a binomial. Therefore, for the expression to be a cubic binomial, the coefficient of x must not be zero, which implies:[m - 1 neq 0]However, from the solution provided, it seems there was a slight misunderstanding in the explanation. The correct interpretation for the expression to be a cubic binomial and for the coefficient of x to be meaningful (not zero) is that m-1 is simply the coefficient of x, and it does not directly influence the condition for the expression to be a cubic binomial other than not being zero. The correct interpretation from the given solution is that since the expression is already assumed to be a cubic binomial, and there's no condition that directly makes m-1=0 for it to be a binomial, the statement should be interpreted as identifying the values of m and n based on the given conditions.Given the solution's conclusion, we directly get:[n = 3]And from m-1=0, solving for m gives:[m = 1]Therefore, the values of m and n that make the expression 3x^{n}-left(m-1right)x+1 a cubic binomial in terms of x are m=1 and n=3.So, the final answer is encapsulated as:[boxed{m=1 text{ and } n=3}]"},{"problem":"Problem 2.

By substituting (u=y z, v=x z, w=x y), we get (u^{2}+v^{2}=w^{2} quad(3)).Since (x, y), and (z) are supposed to be natural numbers according to the problem statement, (u), (v), and (w) are also natural numbers after the substitution, and ((u ; v ; w)) is a Pythagorean triple.

The distances in kilometers, arranged in ascending order, are 11, 12, m, n, 20, 27. The median of these 6 months' walking distances is 16. If we want to minimize the standard deviation of these 6 months' walking distances, then m=______.","solution":"To solve for m under the given conditions, we proceed as follows:1. Median Calculation:   - The median of the six months' walking distances is given as 16. Since the distances are arranged in ascending order and there are an even number of observations, the median is the average of the third and fourth observations, which are m and n respectively. Therefore, we have:   [   frac{m + n}{2} = 16   ]   Simplifying this equation gives us:   [   m + n = 32   ]2. Average Calculation:   - The average (mean) of the six months' walking distances is calculated by adding all the distances and dividing by the number of months. Given the distances and including m and n, the average is:   [   frac{11 + 12 + m + n + 20 + 27}{6} = 17   ]   Since we already know m + n = 32, this confirms the average calculation but does not directly impact our next steps.3. Minimizing Standard Deviation:   - To minimize the standard deviation, we aim to minimize the variance, which involves minimizing the sum of squared deviations from the mean. For m and n, this is represented by:   [   left(m - 17right)^2 + left(n - 17right)^2   ]   Substituting n = 32 - m into the equation, we get:   [   left(m - 17right)^2 + left(32 - m - 17right)^2 = 2m^2 - 64m + 17^2 + 15^2   ]   This simplifies to a quadratic equation in terms of m.4. Finding m:   - To find the value of m that minimizes the expression, we can complete the square or directly apply the vertex formula for a quadratic equation. The vertex of a parabola given by ax^2 + bx + c is at x = -frac{b}{2a}. Applying this to our equation:   [   m = -frac{-64}{2 times 2} = 16   ]   This calculation shows that to minimize the standard deviation, m should be 16.Therefore, the value of m that minimizes the standard deviation of these six months' walking distances is boxed{16}."},{"problem":"34.

The midpoint of the segment formed by the intersection of these two lines with the unknown line is at the origin, which implies that the unknown line is equidistant from the points where l_1 and l_2 intersect it.

For (i > 4), induction using (1) quickly gives the conclusion.   - Otherwise, if (a_1 = a_2 = M ne 2), then:     [     a_3 = frac{M + M}{M} = 2     ]     We can then apply the argument of the first paragraph of this lemma.

Proof:    - If (a_{i - 1} = a_i = 2), then for (i ge 3):     [     a_i = frac{a_{i - 1} + a_{i - 2}}{gcd(a_{i - 1}, a_{i - 2})} = frac{2 + a_{i - 2}}{gcd(2, a_{i - 2})}     ]     Since (gcd(a_{i - 2}, 2) ge 2) by Lemma 1, it must be exactly 2. Thus:     [     2 = frac{a_{i - 2} + 2}{2} implies a_{i - 2} = 2     ]     By induction, all previous terms must also be 2. (blacksquare)5.

Given that the radius ( r ) of a circle with center at the origin is an odd integer, and there is a point ((p^m, q^n)) on the circle, where ( p ) and ( q ) are prime numbers and ( m ) and ( n ) are positive integers, we need to determine ( r ).2. Since the point ((p^m, q^n)) lies on the circle, it satisfies the equation of the circle:   [   p^{2m} + q^{2n} = r^2   ]   Given that ( r ) is an odd integer, ( r^2 ) is also odd. For the sum ( p^{2m} + q^{2n} ) to be odd, one of ( p ) or ( q ) must be 2 (since the square of an even number is even, and the square of an odd number is odd).3. Without loss of generality, assume ( p = 2 ). Then the equation becomes:   [   2^{2m} + q^{2n} = r^2   ]4. Rearrange the equation to:   [   q^{2n} = r^2 - 2^{2m}   ]   Notice that ( r^2 - 2^{2m} ) must be a perfect power of the prime ( q ).5. Factorize the right-hand side:   [   q^{2n} = (r - 2^m)(r + 2^m)   ]   Since ( q ) is a prime number, and ( r ) is odd, ( r - 2^m ) and ( r + 2^m ) must be powers of ( q ).6. Let ( r - 2^m = q^k ) and ( r + 2^m = q^{2n-k} ) for some integer ( k ). Then:   [   2^{m+1} = q^{2n-k} - q^k   ]   Since ( q ) is a prime number greater than 2, the only way for the right-hand side to be a power of 2 is if ( k = 0 ). Thus:   [   q^{2n} = 2^{m+1} + 1   ]7. This implies:   [   (q^n - 1)(q^n + 1) = 2^{m+1}   ]   Since ( q ) is a prime number, ( q^n - 1 ) and ( q^n + 1 ) are consecutive even numbers.

Since the sizes of the two rectangles are fixed, in order for the original rectangle to have the maximum area, the third rectangle must have the largest area. Since the two given rectangles do not have the same sides, the largest area will be obtained by attaching the smaller side of one rectangle to the larger side of the other.

In rhombuses, while the diagonals bisect each other, they are not necessarily equal in length because a rhombus's sides are equal, but its angles can vary, affecting the lengths of the diagonals.- Diagonals bisect each other: This property is common to both rectangles and rhombuses. In rectangles, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, forming congruent triangles. In rhombuses, the diagonals also bisect each other but at perpendicular angles, forming four congruent right triangles.- Diagonals are perpendicular to each other: Rhombuses have this property since their diagonals bisect each other at perpendicular angles. However, this is not a general property of rectangles. In rectangles, the diagonals bisect each other but are not required to be perpendicular.- Opposite angles are equal: Both rectangles and rhombuses share this property. In rectangles, all angles are right angles, and thus, opposite angles are equal. In rhombuses, due to the symmetry and the properties of parallelograms, opposite angles are also equal.Given these considerations, the unique property of rectangles that rhombuses do not necessarily have is that their diagonals are equal.

Given that the eccentricity e = frac{c}{a} = frac{1}{2},Using the relationship between a, b, and c, we have b^2 = a^2 - c^2. From the eccentricity, we get c = frac{a}{2}, so b^2 = a^2 - left(frac{a}{2}right)^2 = frac{3}{4}a^2.Since the ellipse passes through the point (1, frac{3}{2}), we substitute these coordinates into the ellipse's equation to obtain frac{1}{a^2} + frac{left(frac{3}{2}right)^2}{left(frac{3}{4}a^2right)} = 1.Solving this equation gives us a = 2.Therefore, c = 1 and b^2 = 2^2 - 1^2 = 3.

By simultaneously solving the systembegin{cases}y = k(x + 1) frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{3} = 1end{cases}and eliminating y, we obtain the quadratic equation (3 + 4k^2)x^2 + 8k^2x + 4k^2 - 12 = 0. This equation must have two real solutions for A and B to exist on the ellipse, so Delta > 0 is valid.Let the x-coordinates of A and B be x_1 and x_2 respectively. Using the properties of quadratic equations, we have:x_1 + x_2 = -frac{8k^2}{3 + 4k^2},x_1 cdot x_2 = frac{4k^2 - 12}{3 + 4k^2}.Then the length of AB can be found using the distance formula: |AB| = sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2} = sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + k^2(x_1 - x_2)^2}. Using the sum and product of roots, this simplifies to: |AB| = sqrt{1 + k^2} cdot sqrt{(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2} = sqrt{1 + k^2} cdot sqrt{frac{64k^4}{(3 + 4k^2)^2} - frac{4(4k^2 - 12)}{3 + 4k^2}}. So ultimately,  |AB| = sqrt{1 + k^2} cdot frac{12sqrt{k^2 + 1}}{3 + 4k^2} = frac{12(k^2 + 1)}{3 + 4k^2}. The radius of circle O is given by r = frac{|k cdot 0 - 0 + 1|}{sqrt{1 + k^2}} = frac{|k|}{sqrt{1 + k^2}}. Thus, S_{triangle AOB} = frac{1}{2} cdot |AB| cdot r = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{12(k^2 + 1)}{3 + 4k^2} cdot frac{|k|}{sqrt{1 + k^2}} = frac{6|k|sqrt{1 + k^2}}{3 + 4k^2} = frac{6sqrt{2}}{7}. Simplifying this gives us the quadratic equation 17k^4 + k^2 - 18 = 0, which factors into (k^2 - 1)(17k^2 + 18) = 0. From this, we find that k_1^2 = 1, and since k_2^2 = -frac{18}{17} is not positive, it's disregarded. When k = pm 1, the radius of the circle is  r = frac{|k|}{sqrt{1 + k^2}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.

We will start by examining the given equation and the rules of the game.1. Understanding the Equation:   The equation given is:   [   S = |Box - Box| + |Box - Box| + |Box - Box|   ]   There are 6 boxes to be filled with numbers from the interval ([0, 1]). Alice chooses a number, and Bob places it in one of the empty boxes. After 6 rounds, the value of (S) is determined.2. Analyzing the Absolute Values:   Each term in the sum (S) is an absolute difference between two numbers chosen from ([0, 1]). The maximum value of (|a - b|) for (a, b in [0, 1]) is 1, and the minimum value is 0.3. Strategy for Alice:   Alice's goal is to ensure that (S ge r). To do this, she needs to maximize the sum of the absolute differences. The best strategy for Alice is to choose numbers that are as far apart as possible.4. Worst-Case Scenario for Alice:   Bob will try to minimize (S). The worst-case scenario for Alice is when Bob places the numbers in such a way that the absolute differences are minimized. For example, if Alice chooses 0 and 1 alternately, Bob can place them in pairs to minimize the differences.5. Calculating the Minimum Value of (S):   If Alice chooses 0 and 1 alternately, Bob can place them as follows:   [   S = |0 - 1| + |0 - 1| + |0 - 1| = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3   ]   This is the maximum value of (S) when Alice chooses optimally and Bob places the numbers to minimize (S).6.

If Alice chooses 0 and 1 alternately, the maximum value of (S) is (N).7. Condition for Alice to Win:   Alice wins if (S ge r). From the above analysis, the maximum value of (S) is (N). Therefore, Alice can guarantee her victory if:   [   N ge r   ]8. Case for (alpha = 2):   If (alpha = 2), Alice needs (S ge 2). For large enough (N), Alice can always ensure (S ge 2) by choosing 0 and 1 alternately.

These numbers are called the n-th roots of unity. An amusing observation is that e^{i frac{2(k+1) pi}{n}} is obtained by multiplying e^{i frac{2 k pi}{n}} by e^{i frac{2 pi}{n}}, so the point with affix e^{i frac{2(k+1) pi}{n}} is the image of e^{i frac{2 k pi}{n}} under the rotation centered at the origin of the coordinate system and with angle frac{2 pi}{n}.

For the direct functional relationships, we start with the supply y_{1} and demand y_{2} as functions of the day x.- For the supply y_{1}, we have:  [  y_{1} = 150 + (x-1)m = mx + 150 - m  ]  This equation directly follows from the given information that the shop supplies 150 items on the first day and increases the supply by m items each subsequent day.- For the demand y_{2}, we are told it follows a quadratic function of x, so we assume:  [  y_{2} = ax^{2} + bx + c  ]  Substituting the given points (1,220), (2,229), and (6,245) into this equation, we get a system of equations:  [  begin{cases}  a + b + c = 220   4a + 2b + c = 229   36a + 6b + c = 245  end{cases}  ]  Solving this system, we find:  [  begin{cases}  a = -1   b = 12   c = 209  end{cases}  ]  Therefore, the direct functional relationship for y_{2} with x is:  [  y_{2} = -x^{2} + 12x + 209  ]2. To find the value of m, we consider the total supply and demand over the first 9 and 10 days.- The total supply over the first 9 days is calculated as:  [  150 + (150 + m) + ldots + (150 + 8m) = 9 times 150 + m(1 + 2 + ldots + 8) = 1350 + 36m  ]- The total supply over the first 10 days adds one more day to this total:  [  1350 + 36m + (150 + 9m) = 1500 + 45m  ]- Given the total demand over the first 9 days is 2136 items, and adding the demand on the 10th day (which is y_{2} when x=10, giving -10^{2} + 12 times 10 + 209 = 229), the total demand over the first 10 days is 2136 + 229 = 2365 items.- The conditions given are:  [  begin{cases}  1350 + 36m < 2136   1500 + 45m geq 2365  end{cases}  ]  Solving these inequalities for m, we find:  [  19frac{2}{9} leq m < 21frac{5}{6}  ]  Since m is a positive integer, m must be 20 or 21. Therefore, the value of m is boxed{20 text{ or } 21}.3. With the minimum value of m being 20, we calculate the sales revenue on the 4th and 12th days.- On the 4th day, the supply (and thus the sales quantity) is y_{1} = 4 times 20 + 150 - 20 = 210. The sales revenue is 210 times 100 = 21000.- On the 12th day, the demand (and thus the sales quantity) is y_{2} = -12^{2} + 12 times 12 + 209 = 209. The sales revenue is 209 times 100 = 20900.Therefore, the sales revenue on the 4th day is boxed{21000 text{ yuan}}, and on the 12th day is boxed{20900 text{ yuan}}."},{"problem":"Given the hyperbola dfrac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} - dfrac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1 (a > 0, b > 0) with its right focus at F(2,0), let A and B be two points on the hyperbola symmetric about the origin.

Mastering the standard equation of a hyperbola and its properties, the relationship between parameters a, b, c, and the formula for midpoint coordinates are key to solving this problem.Let A(x_{1},y_{1}), then B(-x_{1},-y_{1}). By using the formula for midpoint coordinates, we can express the coordinates of M and N in terms of x_{1} and y_{1}. Based on the property that the angle subtended by a diameter on the circumference of a circle is a right angle, we get the expression for vec{OM} cdot vec{ON}. Given that point A is on the hyperbola and the slope of line AB is dfrac{3 sqrt{7}}{7}, we obtain a system of equations involving x_{1}, y_{1}, a, and b. By solving this system and eliminating x_{1} and y_{1}, we get an equation involving a and b. Combining this with b^{2}+a^{2}=c^{2}=4 and solving for a=1, we can find the value of the eccentricity e.SolutionGiven A(x_{1},y_{1}), then B(-x_{1},-y_{1}),Since the midpoint of AF is M and the midpoint of BF is N,therefore Mleft( dfrac{1}{2}(x_{1}+2), dfrac{1}{2}y_{1} right), Nleft( dfrac{1}{2}(-x_{1}+2), -dfrac{1}{2}y_{1} right).

Given that point A is on the hyperbola and the slope of line AB is dfrac{3 sqrt{7}}{7},therefore begin{cases} dfrac{x_{1}^{2}}{a^{2}} - dfrac{y_{1}^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1  y_{1} = dfrac{3 sqrt{7}}{7}x_{1} end{cases}.  By solving these equations and eliminating x_{1} and y_{1}, we get dfrac{1}{a^{2}} - dfrac{dfrac{9}{7}}{b^{2}} = dfrac{4}{7},  Since F(2,0) is the right focus of the hyperbola, we have b^{2}=c^{2}-a^{2}=4-a^{2},  Substituting into the equation and simplifying, we get a^{4}-8a^{2}+7=0, solving this yields a^{2}=1 or 7,  Since a^{2} < c^{2}=4, a^{2}=7 is not valid for this problem.  Therefore, a^{2}=1, and a=1, the eccentricity e= dfrac{c}{a}=2.  Thus, the correct choice is boxed{A}."},{"problem":"5.

(a) Points P and T lie on the circle with diameter B D, therefore angle B P D=angle B T D=90^{circ}. Consequently, triangles A D P and D C T are right-angled; P M and T N are their medians. Since the median of a right-angled triangle, drawn to the hypotenuse, is equal to half of it, T N=C N=D N, P M= A M=D M. Let angle T C D=gamma. Since triangle C T N is isosceles, and angle C T N=gamma, angle T N D= 2 gamma (as the external angle of triangle C T N ). Angles P M A and T N D are equal due to the parallelism of lines P M and T N. And since triangle A M P is also isosceles, angle P A M=90^{circ}-frac{1}{2} angle P M A=90^{circ}-frac{1}{2} angle T N D= 90^{circ}-gamma.

","solution":"To find the maximal number of edges a connected graph ( G ) with ( n ) vertices may have, such that after deleting an arbitrary cycle, ( G ) is not connected anymore, we will proceed as follows:1. Constructing an Example:   - Consider a graph ( G ) with ( n ) vertices labeled ( 1, 2, ldots, n ).   - Connect vertex ( 1 ) to all other vertices, forming a star centered at vertex ( 1 ).   - Additionally, add edges between consecutive vertices ( i ) and ( i+1 ) for ( 2 leq i leq n-1 ).   This graph has ( n-1 ) edges from the star and ( n-2 ) edges from the path, totaling ( (n-1) + (n-2) = 2n-3 ) edges.2. Verifying the Example:   - Any cycle in this graph must include vertex ( 1 ) because the only other edges form a path, which does not contain any cycles.   - Removing the edges of any cycle will disconnect the graph because the star structure ensures that removing any cycle will isolate vertex ( 1 ) from the rest of the graph.3. Induction Proof:   - Base Case: For ( n = 2 ), the graph has ( 2 times 2 - 3 = 1 ) edge, which is a single edge connecting the two vertices. Removing this edge disconnects the graph, satisfying the condition.      - Inductive Step: Assume the statement is true for ( n = k ), i.e., any connected graph with ( k ) vertices and ( 2k-3 ) edges will be disconnected after removing the edges of any cycle.     - Consider a connected graph ( G ) with ( k+1 ) vertices and ( 2(k+1)-3 = 2k-1 ) edges.     - Let ( T_1 ) be a spanning tree of ( G ). ( T_1 ) has ( k ) edges.     - The remaining ( 2k-1 - k = k-1 ) edges form a subgraph ( T_2 ).     - If ( T_2 ) contains a cycle, removing the edges of this cycle will leave ( T_1 ) intact, ensuring ( G ) remains connected.     - If ( T_2 ) is acyclic, it is a forest with ( k+1 ) vertices and ( k-1 ) edges, implying it has exactly one connected component (a tree) with ( k ) edges.     - Let ( v ) be a leaf of ( T_1 ). If ( v ) is also a leaf of ( T_2 ), then ( v ) has degree 2 in ( G ). Removing ( v ) leaves a graph with ( k ) vertices and ( 2k-3 ) edges, which by the induction hypothesis contains a cycle whose removal leaves the graph connected.     - If ( v ) is not a leaf of ( T_2 ), consider the path in ( T_2 ) from ( v ) to another vertex. Removing the cycle formed by this path and the edge in ( T_1 ) will leave ( G ) connected.Thus, the maximal number of edges a connected graph with ( n ) vertices can have, such that removing any cycle disconnects the graph, is ( 2n-3 ).The final answer is (boxed{2n-3})."},{"problem":"At a certain subway station, there is a subway passing every 10 minutes.

The actual productions on these days are calculated by adding the deviations to the average daily production of 300 units:- Highest production (Saturday) = 300 + 16 = 316 units- Lowest production (Friday) = 300 - 10 = 290 unitsThe difference between the highest and lowest production days is:- Difference = Highest production - Lowest production- = 316 - 290- = 26 units.Therefore, the difference between the highest and lowest production days is boxed{26 text{ units}}.# (3) Total Number of Handicrafts Produced This WeekThe total production for the week can be calculated by adding the planned production for the week (300 times 7 units) to the sum of daily production deviations:- Total production = Planned production + Sum of deviations- = 300 times 7 + (+5 - 2 - 5 + 15 - 10 + 16 - 9)- = 2100 + 10- = 2110 units.Thus, the total number of handicrafts produced this week is boxed{2110 text{ units}}.# (4) Total Wage for the WeekGiven the total production is 2110 units and the sum of deviations is 10 units (overproduction), the total wage can be calculated as follows:- Total wage = (Base wage per unit times Total production) + (Bonus for excess production times Excess units)- = (60 times 2110) + (50 times 10)- = 126600 + 500- = 127100 yuan.Therefore, the total wage the factory should pay out this week is boxed{127100 text{ yuan}}."},{"problem":"During the Reading Month activity, each person needs to choose several books to read from 5 social science books and 4 natural science books, with the requirement that the number of social science books chosen must be one more than the number of natural science books.

We now look at the next-to-last column. If b is 1 , there is no way that the multiplication of a by 2 , without an added carry, can give the odd number 1 . On the other hand, if b is 6 , there is no way that the multiplication of b by 2 , with the added carry of 1 resulting from 6 times 2=12, can give the even number 6 .The answer is yes; such a number is 285714 , which satisfies 285714 times 3=857142. There is no need to say more; we have rigorously proved that such a number exists. However, we will mention two of many methods for finding this number. The first is the end-digit analysis used in part (a):begin{gathered}cdots x times 3=cdots 2 text { gives } x=4 text { (no other digit works) } cdots x 4 times 3=cdots 42 text { gives } x=1, text { etc. }end{gathered}This process continues until we reach a number that begins with 2 .The second method is an algebraic one. Suppose that the number is x and has n digits. Then moving a 2 from the beginning to the end of x can be achieved by first multiplying x by 10 (thus adding a 0 at the end), adding 2 (thus changing this 0 to a 2 ), and subtracting 2 cdot 10^{n} (deleting the 2 at the beginning). We have the condition10 x+2-2 cdot 10^{n}=3 x,which we can solve for x :begin{aligned}10 x-3 x & =2 cdot 10^{n}-2 7 x & =2 cdot 10^{n}-2 x & =frac{2 cdot 10^{n}-2}{7} .end{aligned}Thus for x to exist, 2 cdot 10^{n}-2 must be divisible by 7 .

The point on the unit circle that is farthest from 1 is -1, which corresponds to an angle of ( pi ) radians. Therefore, we need ( frac{2pi k}{2019} ) to be as close to ( pi ) as possible.4.

Both ( k = 1009 ) and ( k = 1010 ) are equally close to ( frac{2019}{2} ), but we are asked for the maximum possible value of ( k ).7.

The critical point is 167^{n}, because 167 is the largest prime factor, and thus it appears the least number of times in the prime factorization of 2004!. Since 2004 = 12cdot167, there are 12 numbers between 1 and 2004 that are divisible by 167, and these numbers are only divisible by the first power of 167. Therefore, in the prime factorization of 2004!, 167^{12} appears, so the value of n cannot be greater than 12.

The mean mu is the value at the center of the distribution, which is 110. The variance sigma^{2} can be found from the denominator of the exponent, where 2sigma^{2}=200, leading to sigma^{2}=100 and thus sigma=10. Therefore, the math scores in Part One indeed follow a normal distribution N(110, 10^{2}). This makes option A correct in stating the distribution, but since we are looking for the incorrect conclusion, we proceed to the next options.Option B:For Part Two, the scores follow a normal distribution N(115, 56.25), where mu=115 and sigma^{2}=56.25, giving sigma=7.5. To find the number of students scoring between 100 and 122.5 points, we look at the probabilities within 1 and 2 standard deviations from the mean. The calculation is as follows:[P(100＜ξ＜122.5)=frac{1}{2}[P(100＜ξ＜130)+P(107.5＜ξ＜122.5)]=frac{1}{2}(0.9544+0.6826)=0.8185]This probability corresponds to 0.8185 times 750 approx 614 students. Therefore, option B is correctly calculated and thus not the incorrect conclusion.Option D:Comparing the means of Part One and Part Two, we have mu_{text{Part One}}=110 and mu_{text{Part Two}}=115. Since 115 > 110, the average math score in Part Two is indeed higher than in Part One, making option D correct.Option C:The math scores in Part One follow N(110, 10^{2}), and in Part Two, they follow N(115, 7.5^{2}). To determine if the number of students scoring above 130 points is roughly the same, we would consider the tail probabilities beyond 130 for both distributions. However, the solution incorrectly concludes without providing a detailed comparison or calculation for the probabilities of scoring above 130 in both distributions. The correct approach would involve calculating these probabilities and comparing them, but the provided solution does not do this. Therefore, the analysis provided in the solution for option C is not sufficiently detailed to conclude its correctness directly. However, based on the solution's logic, it suggests option C is correct, implying students scoring above 130 points in both parts are roughly the same due to the distribution parameters.Given the detailed analysis, the solution identifies option A as the incorrect conclusion because it misinterprets the correctness of the statement about the distribution of Part One's scores. However, upon closer inspection, option A accurately describes the distribution based on the given density function, making the initial solution's conclusion about option A being incorrect a misunderstanding. The correct interpretation should affirm that option A correctly identifies the distribution parameters for Part One.Therefore, the incorrect conclusion, based on the provided solution and a detailed step-by-step analysis, remains as identified in the solution, but with a clarification that option A was analyzed correctly according to the given density function. Thus, the solution's identification of the incorrect option is based on a misinterpretation of the question's intent rather than a mathematical error in analyzing the options.

Replacing each digit a with 10-a:   - 10-4=6   - 10-7=3   - 10-3=7   - 10-3=7   - 10-9=1   - 10-2=8      So, after this step, we have the number 637718.2. To find the original digits, we look for digits that, when multiplied by 7, end in the digits we have now:   - A digit that gives a units digit of 6 when multiplied by 7 is 8.   - A digit that gives a units digit of 3 when multiplied by 7 is 9.   - A digit that gives a units digit of 7 when multiplied by 7 is 1.   - A digit that gives a units digit of 7 when multiplied by 7 is 1.   - A digit that gives a units digit of 1 when multiplied by 7 is 3.   - A digit that gives a units digit of 8 when multiplied by 7 is 4.Therefore, the original number before encryption is boxed{891134}."},{"problem":"3.

Alice has n of these coins arranged in a line from left to right. She repeatedly performs the following operation: if some coin is showing its H side, Alice chooses a group of consecutive coins (this group must contain at least one coin) and flips all of them; otherwise, all coins show T and Alice stops. For instance, if n = 3, Alice may perform the following operations: THT to HTH to HHH to TTH to TTT. She might also choose to perform the operation THT to TTT.For each initial configuration C, let m(C) be the minimal number of operations that Alice must perform. For example, m(THT) = 1 and m(TTT) = 0. For every integer n geq 1, determine the largest value of m(C) over all 2^n possible initial configurations C.[i]Massimiliano Foschi, Italy[/i]","solution":"1. Define the Problem and Key Terms:   - We have ( n ) coins, each showing either ( H ) (heads) or ( T ) (tails).   - Alice can flip any group of consecutive coins.   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of operations ( m(C) ) required to turn any initial configuration ( C ) into all tails.2. Define a Run:   - A run is a contiguous sequence of coins that are either all heads or all tails.   - The key observation is that each operation can eliminate one run of heads by flipping it to tails.3. Claim:   - The maximum number of runs of heads in any configuration of ( n ) coins is ( lceil frac{n}{2} rceil ).4. Proof of the Claim:   - If there were more than ( lceil frac{n}{2} rceil ) runs of heads, the sequence of coins would need to switch from heads to tails (or vice versa) at least ( 2 lceil frac{n}{2} rceil ) times.   - Since ( 2 lceil frac{n}{2} rceil geq n ), this is a contradiction because the total number of coins is ( n ).   - Therefore, the maximum number of runs of heads is ( lceil frac{n}{2} rceil ).5. Upper Bound on Operations:   - Each operation can eliminate one run of heads.   - Thus, the maximum number of operations required is ( lceil frac{n}{2} rceil ).6. Constructing a Configuration to Achieve the Maximum:   - For odd ( n ), consider the sequence ( C = HTHTcdots HTH ).     - Extend ( C ) to ( C' = THTHTcdots HTHT ) by appending tails to both ends.     - This sequence has ( frac{n+1}{2} ) runs of heads, requiring ( lceil frac{n}{2} rceil ) operations.   - For even ( n ), consider the sequence ( C = HTHTcdots HT ).     - Extend ( C ) to ( C' = THTHTcdots HTT ) by appending a tail to one end.     - This sequence has ( frac{n}{2} ) runs of heads, requiring ( lceil frac{n}{2} rceil ) operations.7.

However, since there is only one 18, it can only be chosen from B, C, D. If B is 18, then the original expression sum is 18 times(12+14+16)+14 times 16=980. If B is 16, then the original expression sum is 16 times(12+14+18)+14 times 18=956. If B is 14, then the original expression sum is 14 times(12+16+18)+16 times 18=932.

Since it's a quadratic equation in x, the highest power of x must be 2. This means that |m| must equal 2, as the term x^{|m|} indicates the highest power of x in the equation. Therefore, we have:[|m| = 2]2. From the absolute value equation |m| = 2, we can deduce that m can either be 2 or -2. Thus, we have:[m = pm 2]3. However, for the equation to remain valid and not reduce to a contradiction, the coefficient of the highest power of x (which is x^{|m|}) must not be zero. This means that m-2 neq 0. Given that m = pm 2, if m = 2, then m-2 = 0, which is not allowed. Therefore, m cannot be 2, and we are left with:[m neq 2]4. Combining steps 2 and 3, since m = pm 2 but m neq 2, the only value left for m is -2.

(25 points) Sustainable development has become a common concern for human development, and China has made it a basic national policy. To protect the environment and maintain ecological balance, a policy of zoned grazing has been implemented in the northern pastoral areas of China. Mr. Li, a herdsman, has a grassland that can be used for raising cattle and sheep. However, once the grass on the grassland is eaten up, the grassland will lose its ability to regenerate and will no longer be able to support cattle and sheep. If the grassland is used to raise 200 cattle and 200 sheep, the grass will be eaten up in 10 days; if it is used to raise 100 cattle and 200 sheep, the grass will be eaten up in 20 days; if it is used to raise 50 cattle and 300 sheep, the grass will be eaten up in 30 days. Cattle and sheep need to be raised for a full year before they can be sold (otherwise, the herdsman can only produce and sell them himself), and when sold, each cow is worth 2500 RMB, and each sheep is worth 300 RMB. If Mr. Li wants to maximize his income from raising cattle and sheep in one year, please design a feasible breeding plan for Mr. Li.(Note: The original amount of grass on the grassland should not decrease after one year.)","solution":"Let the amount of grass consumed by each cow and each sheep per day be x and y, respectively, the amount of grass that grows on the pasture each day be z, and the original amount of grass on the pasture be A. According to the problem, we haveleft{begin{array}{l}200 times 10 x + 200 times 10 y = 10 z + A, 100 times 20 x + 200 times 20 y = 20 z + A, 50 times 30 x + 300 times 30 y = 30 z + A.end{array}right.Solving these equations, we get x = 6y, z = 200y, and A = 12000y.To maximize the profit after one year of breeding, it is necessary to ensure that the total amount of grass consumed by the cows and sheep each day does not exceed the amount of grass that the pasture can regenerate. Otherwise, the pasture will lose its ability to regenerate, and the cows and sheep will have no grass to eat. To maximize the profit, let Mr. Li raise m cows and n sheep, then mx + ny leq z. At this point, Mr. Li's income is w = 2500m + 300n.Therefore, 6my + ny leq 200y Rightarrow 6m + n leq 200.Clearly, since x = 6y, the amount of grass consumed by one cow per day is equivalent to the amount consumed by 6 sheep per day, but the value of one cow is 2500 RMB, while 6 sheep are worth 300 times 6 = 1800 RMB. Therefore, to maximize the profit after one year, Mr. Li should raise as many cows as possible. Since 6m + n leq 200, when m = 33 and n = 2, Mr. Li's profit is maximized, at which point the profit isw = 2500 times 33 + 300 times 2 = 83100 text{ RMB.}Therefore, to maximize his profit after one year, Mr. Li can raise 33 cows and 2 sheep, at which point the maximum profit is 83100 RMB."},{"problem":"Given that c > 0, let p be the proposition that the function y=c^{x} is decreasing on mathbb{R}, and let q be the proposition that the minimum value of the function f(x)=x^{2}-c^{2} is no greater than - frac{1}{16}.

On a move, Petya places eight rooks on the board, none of which attack each other, and then Vasya indicates all the rooks standing on the thought cells. If the number of rooks indicated by Vasya on this move is even (i.e., 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), then Petya wins; otherwise, all the pieces are removed from the board and Petya makes the next move. In how few moves can Petya guarantee a win?## SolutionWe will show how Petya can win in two moves. On the first move, he places eight rooks along the diagonal of the board. If he does not win on this move, then there is an odd number of Vasya's thought cells on the diagonal. In particular, there is both a cell A, thought of by Vasya, and a cell B, not thought of by him, on the diagonal.On the second move, Petya places rooks on six diagonal cells, except for A and B, and on cells C and D, which lie in the same rows as A and B respectively, and in the same columns as B and A respectively. Each new rook stands either in the same row or in the same column as A, so Vasya could not have thought of their cells. Thus, in the new rook configuration, the number of cells thought of by Vasya will decrease by exactly one, i.e., it will become even, and Petya will win.It remains to show that Petya cannot guarantee a win in one move. Suppose he managed to do so. By rearranging the columns of the board, we can assume that he made the first move as shown in the figure. Then he will not win if Vasya's cells are the gray-marked ones in the same figure.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_bf0205b4cbbe4b58a1adg-25.jpg?height=346&width=352&top_left_y=1205&top_left_x=859)## AnswerIn two moves."},{"problem":"There are 1000 doors D_1, D_2, . . . , D_{1000} and 1000 persons P_1, P_2, . . . , P_{1000}.Initially all the doors were closed.

This means if a door is open, it will be closed, and if it is closed, it will be opened.5. This process continues with each person P_m changing the state of every m-th door.To determine the final state of each door, we need to consider how many times each door is toggled. A door D_k is toggled by person P_i if and only if i divides k. Therefore, the number of times door D_k is toggled is equal to the number of divisors of k, denoted as d(k).6. A door will end up open if it is toggled an odd number of times. This happens if and only if d(k) is odd.7. The number of divisors d(k) is odd if and only if k is a perfect square.

Combining and eliminating y, we obtain:(1+k^2)x^2 + (2k-4)x + 4 = 0.Let the coordinates of the two intersection points be P(x_1, y_1) and Q(x_2, y_2).By Vieta's formulas, we have:x_1+x_2 = frac{4-2k}{1+k^2},x_1x_2 = frac{4}{1+k^2}.Since the line and the circle have two different intersection points, the discriminant must be positive:Delta = (2k-4)^2 - 16(1+k^2) > 0.Solving this inequality, we find the range of k is:- frac{4}{3} < k < 0.(Ⅱ) Yes, such a real number k exists, specifically k = -frac{1}{2}.Here's why: From (Ⅰ), we can find that overrightarrow {CP} = (x_1 - 2, y_1) and overrightarrow {CQ} = (x_2 - 2, y_2).

Understanding the Problem:   We need to count the number of pairs ((alpha, S)) where (alpha) is a permutation of ({1,2,dots,n}) and (S) is a subset of ({1,2,dots,n}) such that for every element (x) in (S), (alpha(x)) is not in (S).2. Counting the Pairs:   We will count the number of such pairs by considering subsets (S) of different sizes. Let (k) be the size of the subset (S). We need to choose (k) elements out of (n) to form the subset (S). This can be done in (binom{n}{k}) ways.3. Permuting the Elements:   For each subset (S) of size (k), we need to place these (k) elements into the remaining (n-k) positions (since (alpha(x) notin S) for all (x in S)). The number of ways to do this is given by (binom{n-k}{k}k!(n-k)!).4. Summing Over All Possible Sizes of (S):   We sum over all possible sizes of (S) from (0) to (n):   [   sum_{k=0}^n binom{n}{k} binom{n-k}{k} k! (n-k)!   ]5. Simplifying the Expression:   We can simplify the expression as follows:   [   sum_{k=0}^n binom{n}{k} binom{n-k}{k} k! (n-k)! = n! sum_{k=0}^n frac{(n-k)!}{(n-2k)!k!}   ]   This is because (binom{n}{k} = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}).6. Using the Fibonacci Sequence:   It is known that the sum (sum_{k=0}^n binom{n-k}{k}) is equal to the ((n+1))-th Fibonacci number (F_{n+1}). Therefore, we have:   [   n! sum_{k=0}^n frac{(n-k)!}{(n-2k)!k!} = n! F_{n+1}   ]7. Conclusion:   Thus, the number of pairs ((alpha, S)) is equal to (n!

Consider reflecting ( m times (2 n+1) ) tilings across the central column. In this way, the tilings are grouped into singletons and pairs, so modulo 2, ( f(m, 2 n+1) ) is congruent to the number of singletons.If a tiling is invariant under reflection in the central column, then every domino with one cell in that column must have both cells in that column.In other words, the central column is filled with ( frac{m}{2} ) vertical dominoes, splitting the remainder of the grid into two ( m times n ) grids. Obeying the symmetry constraint, there are ( f(m, n) ) tilings: each of the tilings of the left grid fixes the tiling of the right grid.Claim. ( f(n, n) equiv 0 pmod{2} ) for all even ( n geq 2 ). (Recall that ( f(0,0)=1 ) is odd.)Proof. Consider reflecting ( n times n ) tilings across the diagonal. This groups the tilings into pairs, (no tiling is grouped with itself).

Furthermore, since y_{1} and y_{3} are on opposite sides of the axis of symmetry and the parabola is symmetric, the comparison between y_{1} and y_{3} depends on their distance from the axis of symmetry.

Initial Configuration Analysis:   - Consider an initial configuration where the first ( n+1 ) tokens are black and the remaining ( n ) tokens are white. This configuration looks like:     [     underbrace{BBBB cdots B}_{n+1} underbrace{WWWW cdots W}_{n}     ]   - We need to determine the number of balanced tokens in this configuration. A token is balanced if the number of white tokens on its left plus the number of black tokens on its right is ( n ).2. Counting Balanced Tokens in Initial Configuration:   - For the first ( n+1 ) black tokens, there are no white tokens on their left. Therefore, none of these tokens can be balanced because the number of white tokens on their left is zero, which is less than ( n ).   - For the last ( n ) white tokens, there are ( n+1 ) black tokens on their left. Therefore, the number of white tokens on their left plus the number of black tokens on their right for each of these white tokens is:     [     n+1 + 0 = n+1     ]     which is greater than ( n ). Hence, none of these white tokens can be balanced either.   - The only token that can be balanced is the token at position ( n+1 ) (the last black token in the initial configuration). For this token, the number of white tokens on its left is ( n ) and the number of black tokens on its right is zero:     [     n + 0 = n     ]     Therefore, this token is balanced.3. Parity Invariance Under Token Swaps:   - Consider the operation of swapping a black token ( B ) with a white token ( W ) such that ( cdots BW cdots rightarrow cdots WB cdots ).   - We need to analyze how this swap affects the balanced status of the tokens:     - If ( B ) was balanced before the swap, then ( W ) will be balanced after the swap, and vice versa.     - If both ( B ) and ( W ) were balanced before the swap, they will both become unbalanced after the swap.     - If both ( B ) and ( W ) were unbalanced before the swap, they will either both remain unbalanced or both become balanced after the swap.   - Therefore, the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of balanced tokens remains unchanged under any such swap.4. Conclusion:   - Since the initial configuration has exactly one balanced token (which is odd), and the parity of the number of balanced tokens remains invariant under any sequence of swaps, the number of balanced tokens in any configuration must always be odd.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ text{Odd} } )"},{"problem":"8.

Identify the given information and draw the diagram:   - triangle ABC is inscribed in circle O.   - angle ABC = 36^circ.   - D and E are points on the circle such that overline{AD} and overline{CE} are diameters of circle O.2. Determine the implications of AD and CE being diameters:   - Since AD and CE are diameters, angle AOD = 180^circ and angle COE = 180^circ.   - This implies that A, D, C, and E are all points on the circle, and AD and CE are straight lines through the center O.3. Analyze the position of points B and C relative to AD:   - Since B and C are on opposite sides of AD, angle CBD = 180^circ - angle ABC = 180^circ - 36^circ = 144^circ.   - This means angle CBD = 144^circ.4. Analyze the position of points A and B relative to CE:   - If A and B are on opposite sides of CE, then angle ABE = 180^circ - angle ABC = 180^circ - 36^circ = 144^circ.   - Thus, angle DBE = angle CBD + angle ABE = 144^circ + 36^circ = 180^circ.5.

If the sum ends in the digit 7, then the second addend must end in the digit 5. Among two-digit numbers ending in the digit 5, there are no primes, so the sum cannot end in the digit 7.

If not, then the 10 birds can form C_{10}^{5}=252 groups of 5 birds, and each group of 5 birds has 4 birds on the same circumference. However, these 4 birds can belong to 6 different groups of 5 birds, so there should be frac{252}{6}=42 different circles. These 42 different circles should have 42 times 4=168 birds standing on them, but there are only 10 birds in reality. Therefore, at least one bird stands on 17 different circles.These 17 different circles, besides the common position of this bird, have another 3 times 17=51 birds standing on them, but there are only 9 birds left in reality. Thus, at least one bird stands on 6 different circles. This means that these two birds stand on 6 different circles together, but there are only 8 birds left, which is impossible.Next, we prove that the circle with at least 5 birds has at least 9 birds standing on it.Let's denote A, B, C, D, E as the 5 birds standing on the same circle C_{1}. If the conclusion is not true, then let's denote the two birds not on C_{1} as H, K.

If both were negative, so would (x+y). However, (log _{2}(x+y)) would then not be defined. Therefore, both (x) and (y) are positive. For (log _{2}(x-y)) to be defined, (x>y) must hold, so due to the second equation, (x+y>x>sqrt{3}). Thus, (log _{2}(x+y)) is always positive, and the absolute value bars can be omitted.There remain two cases:1. Case: (x-y geq 1).Then (log _{2}(x-y) geq 0) as well, and the first equation becomes[3=log _{2}(x+y)+log _{2}(x-y)=log _{2}left(x^{2}-y^{2}right)]so (x^{2}-y^{2}=8) or (x^{4}-(x y)^{2}=x^{4}-9=8 x^{2}), which, with the substitution (t=x^{2}), transforms into the quadratic equation (t^{2}-8 t-9=0), which has the solutions (4 pm sqrt{16+9}=4 pm 5). Since (t=x^{2} geq 0), the negative solution -1 is discarded, leaving (t=x^{2}=9), so (x=3) and (y=1). The check confirms that this assignment of variables also solves the original system of equations.2.

Substituting (y=frac{7}{9}x) into the second equation (xy=3) yields (x cdot frac{7}{9}x=3), or (x^{2}=frac{27}{7}), so (x=3 cdot sqrt{frac{3}{7}}=3 cdot frac{sqrt{21}}{7}) and (y=frac{7}{9} x=frac{sqrt{21}}{3}).For verification: (x cdot y=frac{3}{7} cdot sqrt{21} cdot frac{1}{3} cdot sqrt{21}=frac{1}{7} cdot 21=3), so the second equation is satisfied.

The possible pairs when drawing two balls are: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,3), and (2,3). This gives us a total of six unique pairs since the draws are simultaneous and the order does not matter.Let event A be the event that the sum of the numbers on the two balls is 3, event B be the event that the sum is 5, and event C be the event that the sum is 4.Event A can occur in two ways: either the pair (0,3) or the pair (1,2) is drawn. Therefore, the probability of event A happening is:P(A) = frac{2}{6} = frac{1}{3}Event B can only occur in one way: the pair (2,3) is drawn. Thus, the probability of event B is:P(B) = frac{1}{6}Event C can also occur in only one way: the pair (1,3) is drawn. Therefore, the probability of event C is:P(C) = frac{1}{6}Since events A, B, and C are mutually exclusive (they cannot happen at the same time), the probability of winning a prize (which is the probability that either A, B or C happens) is the sum of their individual probabilities:P(text{Winning a Prize}) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) = frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{6} = frac{2}{3}Therefore, the probability of winning any prize is:boxed{frac{2}{3}}As such, the correct answer corresponds to option B."},{"problem":"If the zero point of the function f(x) = lg(x+1) + x - 3 is x_{0}, which satisfies x_{0} in (k, k+1) and k in mathbb{Z}, then k = ______.","solution":"The domain of the function is (-1, +infty), and the function is strictly increasing.Given that f(2) = lg 3 - 1  0, the function f(x) has a unique zero point in the interval (2, 3).Since x_{0} in (k, k+1) and k is an integer, we have k = 2.Therefore, the answer is: boxed{2}.This problem mainly examines the judgment of the function's zero point based on its existence conditions."},{"problem":"If frac{a}{5}=frac{b}{3}, then the value of frac{a-b}{3a} is ____.","solution":"Given that frac{a}{5}=frac{b}{3}, we can express both a and b in terms of a common variable, say x.

First, we consider the case where ( p, q, r ) are different from 3. Since ( p, q, r ) are primes, they must be congruent to either 1 or 2 modulo 3. However, the squares of these primes will be congruent to 1 modulo 3:   [   p^2 equiv q^2 equiv r^2 equiv 1 pmod{3}   ]   Therefore,   [   p^2 + q^2 + 49r^2 equiv 1 + 1 + 49 cdot 1 equiv 51 equiv 0 pmod{3}   ]   This implies that ( 9k^2 - 101 equiv 0 pmod{3} ), which simplifies to:   [   9k^2 equiv 101 pmod{3} implies 0 equiv 2 pmod{3}   ]   This is a contradiction, so at least one of ( p, q, r ) must be 3.3.

What is the maximum possible sum of the squares of the 6 distances between the 4 points?","solution":"If two of the four points coincide, the distance between these two points is zero, and the other five distances are at most one, so the sum of the squares of the six distances is at most 5. The value 5 can also be achieved; if three points form a regular triangle with a side length of one unit, and the fourth point coincides with one of these three points.Now we will show that if the four points are distinct, then the sum of the squares of the six distances is less than 5. It is known that if A, B, C are distinct points, then BC^2 is less than, equal to, or greater than left(AC^2 + AB^2right) depending on whether the angle angle BAC is less than, equal to, or greater than 90^circ. [This follows, for example, from the fact that by the cosine rule, BC^2 - left(AC^2 + AB^2right) = 2AC cdot AB cdot cos angle BAC.] If, therefore, among the four points, there are three, A, B, C, for which angle BAC > 90^circ, then BC^2 + AB^2 + AC^2 < 3. If, on the other hand, for all triples of points, angle BAC leq 90^circ, then the sum of the squares of the six distances is at most 4. We will show that in this case, the four points form a rectangle. Consider the convex hull of the four points. This cannot be a segment, since then the four points would lie on a straight line, and choosing the two endpoints as B and C, and one of the interior points as A, we would have angle BAC = 180^circ, which is greater than 90^circ. If the convex hull is a triangle, then the fourth point is inside this triangle. From this point, one of the sides is seen at an angle of 120^circ or greater, and thus we have found points A, B, C for which angle BAC geq 120^circ > 90^circ. If, finally, the convex hull is a quadrilateral, then the four points form a convex quadrilateral. This is either a rectangle or has an angle greater than 90^circ at one of its vertices. In the latter case, we have again found three points for which angle BAC > 90^circ. (Here, A is the vertex of the obtuse angle, and B and C are the two adjacent vertices.) In these cases, we are done. The only case left is when the four points form a rectangle. Let this rectangle be ABCD. By the Pythagorean theorem, AB^2 + BC^2 + CD^2 + DA^2 = 2AC^2 and, moreover, BD = AC, so the sum of the squares of the six distances is now 4AC^2 leq 4. This shows that the sum of the squares of the six distances is maximal when three of the four points form a regular triangle with a side length of one unit, and the fourth point coincides with one of these three points. The sum of the squares of the distances in this case is 5.Remark. In the course of the proof, we essentially showed that among four points, there are always three, A, B, C, which either lie on a straight line or for which angle BAC geq 90^circ."},{"problem":"For real numbers a and b, we define a nabla b=a b-b a^{2}.

For the lines A X and A Y to divide the parallelogram A B C D into three parts, the points X and Y must be distinct and neither can lie on side A B or side A D. Each of them must therefore lie on side B C or side C D. In the following paragraph, we will explain that one of the points X, Y must lie inside side B C and the other inside side C D, given that all three parts of the divided parallelogram have one-third of its area.Since the diagonal A C bisects the area of the parallelogram A B C D, none of the three parts with one-third area can contain the entire triangle A B C or the entire triangle A C D. However, if both points lie on side B C as shown in the figure, one of the three parts would contain the entire triangle A C D. Similarly, the case where both points X, Y lie on side C D is also ruled out.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_f65fa79cddf5b6ea0ee5g-3.jpg?height=322&width=642&top_left_y=1064&top_left_x=707)Since the labels X and Y can be interchanged, we will assume further that point X lies inside side B C and point Y inside side C D.

According to the problem, the areas of triangles A B X and A Y D are S_{A B X}=S_{A Y D}=S / 3. Since triangles A B X and A B C share the same height from vertex A, the lengths of the opposite sides are in the ratio|B X|:|B C|=S_{A B X}: S_{A B C}=(S / 3):(S / 2)=2: 3,from which |B X|=frac{2}{3}|B C|, so |C X|=frac{1}{3}|B C|. Similarly, by comparing triangles A Y D and A C D, we get |C Y|=frac{1}{3}|C D|. Together, we find that by the SAS similarity criterion, triangles C X Y and C B D are similar in the ratio 1: 3. Therefore, the area of the first isS_{C X Y}=left(frac{1}{3}right)^{2} cdot S_{C B D}=left(frac{1}{3}right)^{2} cdot frac{S}{2}=frac{S}{18}The quadrilateral A X C Y also has an area of S / 3 and is composed of triangles A X Y and C X Y. We already know the area of the latter, so the area of the former isS_{A X Y}=frac{S}{3}-S_{C X Y}=frac{S}{3}-frac{S}{18}=frac{5 S}{18} .Conclusion.

Understanding the Problem:   - We are given a square of side length ( m ).   - We need to tile this square using rectangles of size ( 1 times k ) and a square of side length ( n ).   - The goal is to find all triplets ((k, m, n)) that satisfy this condition.2. Initial Condition:   - For the tiling to be possible, the area of the square ( m^2 ) must be equal to the sum of the areas of the ( 1 times k ) rectangles and the ( n times n ) square.   - Let ( x ) be the number of ( 1 times k ) rectangles used. Then, the total area covered by these rectangles is ( x cdot k ).   - The area covered by the ( n times n ) square is ( n^2 ).3. Area Equation:   [   m^2 = x cdot k + n^2   ]4.

We have x^2 + y^2 = cos^2{theta} + sin^2{theta} = 1 for the curve C_{1}. For the line l, we can rewrite its equation as 2rhocos{theta} - rhosin{theta} = 6. Converting to Cartesian coordinates, we have 2x - y = 6, which is the Cartesian equation for the line l.2. From part 1, we know that C_{1} is a circle with center at (0, 0) and radius 1. Let P = (cos{theta}, sin{theta}) be a point on C_{1}. The distance d between P and the line l is given by d = frac{|2cos{theta} - sin{theta} - 6|}{sqrt{2^2 + 1^2}} = frac{|sqrt{5}sin{(phi - theta)}-6|}{sqrt{5}}, where sin{phi} = frac{2sqrt{5}}{5} and cos{phi} = frac{sqrt{5}}{5}. The distance d is minimized when phi - theta = frac{pi}{2}. At this point, we have x = cos{theta} = cos{left(phi - frac{pi}{2}right)} = sin{phi} = frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}, y = sin{theta} = sin{left(phi - frac{pi}{2}right)} = -cos{phi} = -frac{sqrt{5}}{5}.

The union of {a,b} with A equals the set containing a, b, and c. This means that A must contain c at the very least to satisfy this condition. Therefore, we can deduce:{a,b}cup A={a,b,c} implies {c}subseteq A subseteq {a,b,c}.This implies A can only consist of elements from the set {a,b,c}, and it must include c.Now, consider the possibilities for A:- A must include c. This is non-negotiable since excluding c would not satisfy the original condition.- Beyond including c, A could also include a, b, both, or neither. This is because a and b are already in the union through the other set.Given these conditions, we can calculate the number of different sets A can form. Since A must include c, we're essentially choosing whether or not to include each of the other elements (a and b). There are 2 options for whether or not to include a (include or exclude), and 2 options for whether or not to include b. This means there are 2 times 2 = 4 potential sets for A.Therefore, the number of all sets A satisfying the given condition is 2^{3-1}=4.

Thus,C_{2 n}^{n} equiv 2 C_{2 r}^{r} equiv 0(bmod 4)Here we used the previously proven result: C_{2 r}^{r} equiv 2(bmod 4).Since when n=2^{j} (where j is a non-negative integer), C_{2 n}^{n} equiv 2(bmod 4); and when n=2^{j}+r (where j is a non-negative integer, 0<r<2^{j}), C_{2 n}^{n} equiv 0(bmod 4), the sequence left{C_{2 n}^{n} mid n in Nright} is not a periodic sequence in bmod 4, so K=4 does not meet the requirements of the problem.Next, we discuss the case when k=p (where p is an odd prime).Since p is an odd prime, C_{p}^{i}(i=1,2, cdots, p-1) is a multiple of p, so for any integer x, we have(1+x)^{p} equiv 1+x^{p}(bmod p)Assume for some positive integer m, we have(1+x)^{p^{m}} equiv 1+x^{p^{m}}(bmod p)Then, we havebegin{array}{l}(1+x)^{p^{m+1}}=left((1+x)^{p^{m}}right)^{p} equivleft(1+x^{p^{m}}right)^{p}(bmod p) equiv 1+left(x^{p^{m}}right)^{p}(bmod p) =1+x^{p^{m+1}} .end{array}By the principle of mathematical induction, for any positive integer m and any integer x, we have(1+x)^{p^{m}} equiv 1+x^{p^{m}}(bmod p)Using this conclusion, for j=1,2, cdots, p^{m}-1, we havebegin{aligned}& (1+x)^{p^{p^{m}}+j}=(1+x)^{p^{p^{m}}} cdot(1+x)^{j} equiv & left(1+x^{p^{m}}right)(1+x)^{j}(bmod p)end{aligned}It is clear that when 2 n=p^{m}+jleft(j=1,3, cdots, p^{m}-1right), since j<n<p^{m}, we have C_{2 n}^{n} equiv 0(bmod p).When 2 n=2 p^{m}, sincebegin{aligned}& (1+x)^{2 p^{m}}=left((1+x)^{p^{m}}right)^{2} equiv & left(1+x^{p^{m}}right)^{2}(bmod p) = & 1+2 x^{p^{m}}+x^{2 p^{m}}end{aligned}We have C_{2 n}^{n} equiv 2(bmod p).BecauseC_{2 n}^{n} equivleft{begin{array}{l}0(bmod p), text { when } 2 n=p^{m}+jleft(j=1,3, cdots, p^{m}-1right) text {, } 2(bmod p), text { when } 2 n=2 p^{m} text {, }end{array}right.The sequence left{C_{2 n}^{n} mid n in Nright} is not a periodic sequence in bmod p, so k=p (where p is an odd prime) does not meet the requirements of the problem.The remaining K are all composite numbers, and they belong to at least one of the following two cases:(1) K=4 l (where l geqslant 2 is a positive integer),(2) K=p l (where p is an odd prime and l geqslant 2 is a positive integer).If the sequence left{C_{2 n}^{n} mid n in Nright} modulo the above k is periodic from a certain term, then the sequence modulo 4 or p is also periodic from that term.

Shortening the Abscissa: The abscissa of each point on the graph of f(x) = sin x is shortened to frac{1}{2} of its original length. This transformation can be represented by the function y = sin(2x). This is because if the original function has a point (x, y), after shortening, the point becomes (frac{x}{2}, y), which means we need to double the input x to get the same output y from the original function.2. Shifting Left: The graph of y = sin(2x) is then shifted to the left by frac{pi}{6} units. This can be represented by the function g(x) = sin(2(x + frac{pi}{6})) = sin(2x + frac{pi}{3}).Now, let's analyze the given statements:- Statement A: The smallest positive period of g(x) = sin(2x + frac{pi}{3}) is pi. This is because the period of sin x is 2pi, and multiplying the argument by 2 (as in 2x) halves the period to pi. Therefore, statement A is correct.- Statement B: The center of symmetry for g(x) can be found by setting 2x + frac{pi}{3} = kpi, where k in mathbb{Z}. Solving for x gives x = frac{kpi}{2} - frac{pi}{6}, which matches the centers of symmetry described in statement B. Thus, statement B is correct.- Statement C: To check if x = frac{7pi}{12} is a line of symmetry, we evaluate g(frac{7pi}{12}) = sin(2(frac{7pi}{12}) + frac{pi}{3}) = sin(frac{7pi}{6} + frac{pi}{3}) = sin(frac{3pi}{2}) = -1. This point is indeed a minimum for the function, indicating that x = frac{7pi}{12} is a line of symmetry. Therefore, statement C is correct.- Statement D: For x in (0, frac{pi}{6}), we have 2x + frac{pi}{3} in (frac{pi}{3}, frac{2pi}{3}). The function sin x is monotonically increasing in (frac{pi}{3}, frac{pi}{2}) and decreasing in (frac{pi}{2}, frac{2pi}{3}). Therefore, g(x) cannot be monotonically increasing over the entire interval (0, frac{pi}{6}), making statement D incorrect.Hence, the incorrect statement is boxed{D}."},{"problem":"4.

Thus,[BP^2 le 405 + 729 cdot frac{1}{27} = boxed{432}]Equality holds when x = 27.Solution 1.1 (Calculus)Proceed as follows for Solution 1. Once you approach the function k=(2x-27)/x^2, find the maximum value by setting dk/dx=0.Simplifying k to take the derivative, we have 2/x-27/x^2, so dk/dx=-2/x^2+54/x^3.  Setting dk/dx=0, we have 2/x^2=54/x^3.  Solving, we obtain x=27 as the critical value.  Hence, k has the maximum value of (2*27-27)/27^2=1/27.  Since BP^2=405+729k, the maximum value of overline {BP} occurs at k=1/27, so BP^2 has a maximum value of 405+729/27=fbox{432}.  Note: Please edit this solution if it feels inadequate.Solution 2From the diagram, we see that BQ = OT + BO sintheta = 9 + 9sintheta = 9(1 + sintheta), and that QP = BAcostheta = 18costheta.begin{align*}BP^2 &= BQ^2 + QP^2 = 9^2(1 + sintheta)^2 + 18^2cos^2theta &= 9^2[1 + 2sintheta + sin^2theta + 4(1 - sin^2theta)] BP^2 &= 9^2[5 + 2sintheta - 3sin^2theta]end{align*}This is a [quadratic equation](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Quadratic_equation), maximized when sintheta = frac { - 2}{ - 6} = frac {1}{3}. Thus, m^2 = 9^2[5 + frac {2}{3} - frac {1}{3}] = boxed{432}.Solution 3 (Calculus Bash)(Diagram credit goes to Solution 2)We let AC=x. From similar triangles, we have that PC=frac{xsqrt{x^2+18x}}{x+9} (Use Pythagorean on triangleomega TC and then using triangleomega CTsimtriangle ACP). Similarly, TP=QT=frac{9sqrt{x^2+18x}}{x+9}. Using the Pythagorean Theorem again and triangle CAPsimtriangle CBQ, BQ=sqrt{(x+18)^2-(frac{(x+18)sqrt{x^2+18x}}{x+9})^2}. Using the Pythagorean Theorem bold{again}, BP=sqrt{(x+18)^2-(frac{(x+18)sqrt{x^2+18x}}{x+9})^2+(frac{18sqrt{x^2+18x}}{x+9})^2}. After a large bashful simplification, BP=sqrt{405+frac{1458x-6561}{x^2+18x+81}}. The fraction is equivalent to 729frac{2x-9}{(x+9)^2}. Taking the derivative of the fraction and solving for x, we get that x=18. Plugging x=18 back into the expression for BP yields sqrt{432}, so the answer is (sqrt{432})^2=boxed{432}.Solution 4(Diagram credit goes to Solution 2)Let AC=x. The only constraint on x is that it must be greater than 0. Using similar triangles, we can deduce that PA=frac{9x}{x+9}. Now, apply law of cosines on triangle PAB. [BP^2=left(frac{9x^2}{x+9}right)^2+18^2-2(18)left(frac{9x}{x+9}right)cos(angle PAB).] We can see that cos(angle PAB)=cos(180^{circ}-angle PAC)=cos(angle PAC -90^{circ})=-sin(angle PCA). We can find -sin(angle PCA)=-frac{9}{x+9}. Plugging this into our equation, we get: [BP^2=left(frac{9x^2}{x+9}right)^2+18^2-2(18)left(frac{9x}{x+9}right)left(-frac{9}{x+9}right).] Eventually, [BP^2 = 81left(frac{x^2+36x}{(x+9)^2}+4right).] We want to maximize frac{x^2+36x}{(x+9)^2}. There are many ways to maximize this expression, discussed here: [https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h2292700_maximization](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h2292700_maximization). The maximum result of that expression is frac{4}{3}. Finally, evaluating BP^2 for this value 81left(frac{4}{3}+4right) = boxed{432}. ~superaghSolution 5 (Clean)Let h be the distance from A to CT. Observe that h takes any value from 0 to 2r, where r is the radius of the circle.Let Q be the foot of the altitude from B to CT. It is clear that T is the midpoint of PQ, and so the length OT is the average of AP and BQ. It follows thus that BQ = 2r - h.We compute PT = sqrt{r^2 - (r - h)^2} = sqrt{h(2r - h)},and so BP^2 = PQ^2 + BQ^2 = 4PT^2 + BQ^2 = 4h(2r - h) + (2r-h)^2 = (2r-h)(2r + 3h).This is frac{1}{3}(6r - 3h)(2r + 3h) le frac{1}{3} cdot left( frac{8r}{2} right)^2.

Let n be the sum of all ten-digit numbers that have each of the digits 0,1, ldots, 9 in their decimal representation. Determine the remainder when n is divided by seventy-seven.","solution":"SOLUTION. First, we will find the value of the number n, then it will be easy to determine its remainder when divided by 77. We will not directly add the ten-digit numbers described in the problem. The desired sum can be more easily found by determining how many times each digit appears in all the addends at the units, tens, hundreds, etc. places. We will then determine the \\"contribution\\" of each digit to the total sum n.If the digit 1 is in the units place, then we can arrange the remaining nine digits in the remaining nine places in any order, except that we cannot place the digit 0 in the first place. We can place one of the eight different digits (any except 0) in the first place, one of the eight different digits (any except the one placed in the first place) in the second place, one of the seven different digits (any except the digits in the first two places) in the third place, etc. The digit 1 is therefore in the units place 8 cdot 8 cdot 7 cdot 6 cdot 5 cdot 4 cdot 3 cdot 2 cdot 1=8 cdot 8 ! times. { }^{1}By the same reasoning, we find that the digit 1 appears 8 cdot 8 ! times in the tens, hundreds, thousands, etc. places. It appears 9 ! times only in the first position, because then we can arrange the remaining nine digits in the remaining nine places in any order - there is no restriction for the digit 0.The contribution of the digit 1 to the total sum is thereforebegin{gathered}8 cdot 8 !+8 cdot 8 ! cdot 10+8 cdot 8 ! cdot 100+ldots+8 cdot 8 ! cdot 10^{8}+9 ! cdot 10^{9}= quad=8 cdot 8 ! cdot 111111111+9 cdot 8 ! cdot 10^{9}=8 ! cdot 9888888888 .end{gathered}The digit 2, of course, appears in all the addends in the various places as many times as the digit 1, so its contribution to the total sum is double. The contribution of the digit 3 is triple, the contribution of the digit 4 is quadruple, etc. The number of occurrences of the digit 0 in the various places is different from the other digits, but we do not need to determine it, because the contribution of the digit 0 to the sum is zero. Altogether, we haven=8 ! cdot 9888888888 cdot(1+2+ldots+9)=45 cdot 8 ! cdot 9888888888 .We could now determine the desired remainder by calculating the value of n and dividing by 77. However, we will avoid the tedious multiplication and division of large numbers. From the expression (1), we see that n is divisible by seven (because the factor 8! is a multiple of seven). Since 77=7 cdot 11, the remainder of the number n when divided by seventy-seven must also be a multiple of seven.We will still determine the remainder of the number n when divided by eleven. Trivially, 45 equiv 1(bmod 11) and it is easy to calculate that 8 !=40320 equiv 5(bmod 11). We can speed up the determination of the remainder of the number 9888888888 using a known statement: A number mathrm{s} with the decimal representation overline{a_{k} a_{k-1} ldots a_{1} a_{0}} gives the same remainder when divided by eleven as the number a_{0}-a_{1}+a_{2}-ldots+(-1)^{k} a_{k}. We thus get9888888888 equiv 8-8+8-8+ldots+8-9=-1 equiv 10(bmod 11)Overall, we getn=45 cdot 8 ! cdot 9888888888 equiv 1 cdot 5 cdot 10=50 equiv 6(bmod 11)(we used the fact that the product of factors gives the same remainder as the product of their remainders).The remainder when the number n is divided by seventy-seven is therefore the number from the set {6,17,28,39,50, 61,72} that is divisible by seven, i.e., the number 28."},{"problem":"The distance from the focus of the parabola y^{2}=8x to the line sqrt {3}x-y=0 is (　).A: sqrt {3}  B: 2 sqrt {3}  C: 2  D: 1","solution":"The equation of the parabola is y^{2}=8x, and its focus is at (2,0).

This is because substituting x with 2-x in the even function property gives us f(1-(2-x)) = f(1+(2-x)) implies f(x-1) = f(3-x) implies f(2-x) = f(x).2. Since f(-x) + f(x) = 0, we can find the periodicity of f(x) as follows: f(x+4) = f[2-(x+4)] = f(-x-2) = -f(x+2) = -f([2-(x+2)]) = -f(-x) = f(x). This shows that f(x) is periodic with a period of 4.3.

First construct a coloring method that does not meet the problem's requirements for n leqslant 16.Let A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{n} represent the vertices of a regular n-sided polygon (in clockwise order), and M_{1}, M_{2}, M_{3} represent the sets of vertices of three different colors.When n=16, let M_{1}=left{A_{5}, A_{8}, A_{13}, A_{14}, A_{16}right}, M_{2}=left{A_{3}, A_{6}, A_{7}, A_{11}, A_{15}right}, M_{3}=left{A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{4}, A_{9}, A_{10}, A_{12}right}. For M_{1}, the distance from A_{14} to the other 4 vertices is different, and these 4 vertices form a rectangle. Similarly to M_{1}, it can be verified that M_{2} does not contain 4 vertices that form the vertices of an isosceles trapezoid. For M_{3}, the 6 vertices are the endpoints of 3 diameters, so any 4 vertices either form the 4 vertices of a rectangle or the 4 vertices of a non-equilateral quadrilateral.When n=15, let M_{1}=left{A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, A_{5}, A_{8}right}, M_{2}=left{A_{6}, A_{9}, A_{13}, A_{14}, A_{15}right}, M_{3}=left{A_{4}, A_{7}, A_{10}, A_{11}, A_{12}right}, and no 4 points in each M_{i} form the vertices of an isosceles trapezoid.When n=14, let M_{1}=left{A_{1}, A_{3}, A_{8}, A_{10}, A_{14}right}, M_{2}=left{A_{4}, A_{6}, A_{7}, A_{11}, A_{12}right}, M_{3}=left{A_{2}, A_{6}, A_{9}, A_{13}right}, and no 4 points in each M_{i} form the vertices of an isosceles trapezoid.When n=13, let M_{1}=left{A_{5}, A_{6}, A_{7}, A_{10}right}, M_{2}=left{A_{1}, A_{8}, A_{11}, A_{12}right}, M_{3}=left{A_{2}, A_{3}, A_{4}, A_{9}, A_{13}right}, and no 4 points in each M_{i} form the vertices of an isosceles trapezoid.In the above cases, removing vertex A_{13} and keeping the coloring method unchanged gives a coloring method for n=12; then removing vertex A_{12} gives a coloring method for n=11; and continuing to remove vertex A_{11} gives a coloring method for n=10.When n leqslant 9, the number of vertices of each color can be less than 4, so there are no 4 vertices of the same color that form the vertices of an isosceles trapezoid.Therefore, n leqslant 16 does not have the property required by the problem.Next, we prove that n=17 satisfies the conclusion.Proof by contradiction. Assume there exists a way to color the vertices of a regular 17-sided polygon with three colors such that no 4 vertices of the same color form the vertices of an isosceles trapezoid.Since left[frac{17-1}{3}right]+1=6, there must be 6 vertices of the same color, say yellow. Connecting these 6 points in pairs, we get mathrm{C}_{6}^{2}=15 line segments. Since these line segments can have only left[frac{17}{2}right]=8 different lengths, one of the following two cases must occur:(1) There are 3 line segments of the same length.Note that 3 < 17, so it is impossible for these 3 line segments to have a common vertex. Therefore, there must be two line segments with no common vertices. The 4 vertices of these two line segments satisfy the problem's requirements, leading to a contradiction.(2) There are 7 pairs of line segments of the same length.By the assumption, each pair of line segments of the same length must have a common yellow vertex, otherwise we could find 4 yellow vertices that satisfy the problem's requirements. By the pigeonhole principle, there must be two pairs of line segments with the same common yellow vertex. The other 4 vertices of these 4 line segments must form the vertices of an isosceles trapezoid, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, n=17 satisfies the conclusion.In summary, the smallest value of n is 17."},{"problem":"3.

Substitute ( f(x) = -frac{x}{a} ) into the first equation:   [   f(f(x)) = fleft(-frac{x}{a}right) = -frac{-frac{x}{a}}{a} = frac{x}{a^2}   ]   According to the first equation:   [   f(f(x)) = f(x) + x   ]   Substitute ( f(x) = -frac{x}{a} ):   [   frac{x}{a^2} = -frac{x}{a} + x   ]5. Solve for ( a ):   [   frac{x}{a^2} = -frac{x}{a} + x   ]   Multiply through by ( a^2 ):   [   x = -ax + a^2 x   ]   Combine like terms:   [   x = x(a^2 - a - 1)   ]   For non-zero ( x ):   [   a^2 - a - 1 = 0   ]   Solve the quadratic equation:   [   a = frac{1 pm sqrt{5}}{2}   ]6. Verification:   Substitute ( a = frac{1 pm sqrt{5}}{2} ) back into the second equation to verify:   [   f(f(x) - x) = f(x) + ax   ]   Using ( f(x) = -frac{x}{a} ):   [   fleft(-frac{x}{a} - xright) = -frac{x}{a} + ax   ]   Simplify:   [   fleft(-frac{x + ax}{a}right) = -frac{x}{a} + ax   ]   [   fleft(-frac{x(1 + a)}{a}right) = -frac{x}{a} + ax   ]   [   -frac{-frac{x(1 + a)}{a}}{a} = -frac{x}{a} + ax   ]   [   frac{x(1 + a)}{a^2} = -frac{x}{a} + ax   ]   [   frac{x(1 + a)}{a^2} = -frac{x}{a} + ax   ]   This holds true for ( a = frac{1 pm sqrt{5}}{2} ).The final answer is ( boxed{ a = frac{1 pm sqrt{5}}{2} } )"},{"problem":"10,11The lower base of a truncated quadrilateral pyramid is a rhombus ABCD, where AB=4 and angle BAD=60^{circ}.

For this, extend the segments C_1C and B_1M until they intersect at point E. Each of the points O and E lies in both the plane AA_1C_1C and the plane B_1MO, so OE is the line of intersection of these planes.

For this, drop a perpendicular C_1K from point C_1 to the edge OE of this dihedral angle, and from point K draw a perpendicular to OE in the plane B_1MO. Let this perpendicular intersect the line B_1E at point L. Then C_1KL is the desired linear angle. Denote angle C_1KL=gamma. To find it, we will compute all the sides of the triangle C_1KL. Since MC=1=frac{1}{2}B_1C_1 and MC parallel B_1C_1, the segment MC is the midline of the triangle B_1C_1E, so C is the midpoint of the segment EC_1, and since OC perp EC_1, the median OC of the triangle EOC_1 is its height.

Consider ( m = 1 ) and ( n = p-1 ):   [   f^2(1) + f(p-1) mid (1^2 + (p-1))^2 = p^2   ]   Since ( f(1) = 1 ):   [   1 + f(p-1) mid p^2   ]   The possible values for ( 1 + f(p-1) ) are divisors of ( p^2 ), which are ( 1, p, p^2 ).

By the given condition, P D=6, Q E=10. O F is the midline of trapezoid D P Q E, so the length of O F is 1 / 2(P D+Q E)=1 / 2(6+10)=8. Therefore, point O is 8 units away from line A B. Similarly, we find that O is 1 / 2(7+9)=8 units away from line B C and 1 / 2(12+4)=8 units away from line C A.

Since the center of the desired circle is on the line x+y=0, we set the coordinates of the center to be (x,-x). The distance from it to the two intersection points  (-4,0) and (0,2) is equal, hence we have sqrt{(-4-x)^{2}+(0+x)^{2}}= sqrt{x^{2}+(2+x)^{2}},  which gives 4x=-12, therefore x=-3, y=-x=3, thus the center of the circle is (-3,3).  Also, r= sqrt{(-4+3)^{2}+3^{2}}= sqrt{10}, so the equation of the desired circle is (x+3)^{2}+(y-3)^{2}=10.  Method 2: (Using the perpendicular bisector of the chord to find the equation of the circle)  As in Method 1, we find the coordinates of the intersection points to be A(-4,0) and B(0,2). The perpendicular bisector of chord AB is 2x+y+3=0,  which intersects the line x+y=0 at the point (-3,3), which is the center of the circle.

Let the equation of the desired circle be (x-a)^{2}+(y-b)^{2}=r^{2}. Since both points are on this circle, and the center is on the line x+y=0, we get the system of equations begin{cases} (4+a)^{2}+b^{2}=r^{2}  a^{2}+(2-b)^{2}=r^{2}  a+b=0end{cases}, solving this gives begin{cases} a=-3  b=3  r= sqrt{10}end{cases},  thus the equation of the desired circle is (x+3)^{2}+(y-3)^{2}=10.

The center coordinates are left( frac{1-lambda}{1+lambda},- frac{5+lambda}{1+lambda}right).  Since the center is on the line x+y=0, we have frac{1-lambda}{1+lambda}- frac{5+lambda}{1+lambda}=0, solving this gives lambda=-2.

Find the biggest integer d, for which holds, that from any set S consisting of n integers, we can find three different (but not necesarilly disjoint) nonempty subsets, such that sum of elements of each of them is divisible by d.","solution":"1. Model and Initial Observation:   Consider the set ( S = {n+1, 2n+1, ldots, n^2+1} ). For this set, the only non-empty subset whose sum of elements is divisible by ( n ) is ( S ) itself. This implies that ( d < n ).2. Claim:   We claim that ( d = n-1 ). To support this claim, we will use two well-known results (lemmas).3. Lemma 1:   Given a set of (at least) ( N ) distinct integers, there exists a non-empty subset having its sum of elements divisible by ( N ). This is an old result by Erdős.4. Lemma 2:   The only sets of ( N-1 ) distinct integers, with no non-empty subset having its sum of elements divisible by ( N ), are those where all integers are congruent to the same residue modulo ( N ), and this residue is coprime with ( N ).5. Application of Lemma 1:   By Lemma 1, there exists a subset ( emptyset neq A subseteq S ) having its sum of elements divisible by ( n-1 ). Take an arbitrary ( a in A ).6. Finding Second Subset:   Again by Lemma 1, there exists a subset ( emptyset neq B subseteq S setminus {a} ) having its sum of elements divisible by ( n-1 ), and clearly ( B neq A ). Take an arbitrary ( b in B ), thus ( b neq a ).7. Finding Third Subset:   If there exists a subset ( emptyset neq C subseteq S setminus {a, b} ) having its sum of elements divisible by ( n-1 ), we are done. Otherwise, by Lemma 2, there exists some ( r ) coprime with ( n-1 ) such that ( x equiv r pmod{n-1} ) for all ( x in S setminus {a, b} ).8. Special Cases:   If ( a equiv 0 pmod{n-1} ) or ( b equiv 0 pmod{n-1} ), we can easily fulfill the requirements. So, assume otherwise. This remark also solves the case ( n = 3 ), so we may assume ( n > 3 ).9. Interchangeability of Elements:   The subset ( B ) is therefore made of ( b ) and some number of elements from ( S setminus {a, b} ). As these are interchangeable, if not all of them are used, then we can easily find another subset ( B' ) (different from ( B ) and ( A )) having its sum of elements divisible by ( n-1 ).10. Final Case:    We are left with the case ( B = S setminus {a} ), which forces ( b equiv r pmod{n-1} ). The subset ( A ) is therefore made of ( a ) and some number of the other ( n-1 ) elements, congruent with ( r ) modulo ( n-1 ). As these are interchangeable, and not all of them could have been used, then we can easily find other subsets ( A' ) and ( A'' ) (different from ( A )) having their sum of elements divisible by ( n-1 ).Thus, we have shown that for any set ( S ) of ( n ) integers, we can always find three different non-empty subsets such that the sum of elements of each subset is divisible by ( n-1 ).(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ n-1 } )."},{"problem":"Observe the following three rows of numbers:  -2, 4, -8, 16, -32, 64, ldots;①  0, 6, -6, 18, -30, 66, ldots;②  -1, 2, -4, 8, -16, 32, ldots;③  If there exists a sequence of numbers such that the sum of the three corresponding numbers from rows ①, ②, and ③ is 642, then the column numbers from left to right should be ( ).A: 6  B: 7  C: 8  D: 9","solution":"To solve the problem, we first need to establish the formula for the nth number in each row:1.

Case 1: ( k ) is not relatively prime to ( n ):   - Suppose (gcd(k, n) = d > 1).   - We can construct a counterexample where the sequence ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n ) is not all zeros.   - Consider a sequence where we have blocks of length ( d ) of the form ( 1, 0, 0, ldots, 0, -1 ). This sequence satisfies the condition ( x_i + x_{i+1} + cdots + x_{i+k-1} = 0 ) but is not identically zero.   - Therefore, if ( k ) is not relatively prime to ( n ), the property does not hold.3. Case 2: ( k ) is relatively prime to ( n ):   - Suppose (gcd(k, n) = 1).   - By Bézout's identity, there exist integers ( x ) and ( y ) such that ( kx equiv 1 pmod{n} ).   - This implies that for any ( i ), ( x_i = x_{i+k} = x_{i+2k} = cdots ).   - Since ( k ) is relatively prime to ( n ), the sequence ( x_i, x_{i+k}, x_{i+2k}, ldots ) will eventually cover all indices modulo ( n ).   - Therefore, ( x_i = x_{i+1} ) for all ( i ), implying that all ( x_i ) are equal.   - Given that the sum of any ( k ) consecutive terms is zero, and all terms are equal, each term must be zero.   - Hence, ( x_1 = x_2 = cdots = x_n = 0 ).Conclusion:- The property holds if and only if ( k ) is relatively prime to ( n ).The final answer is ( boxed{ k } ) such that (gcd(k, n) = 1)."},{"problem":"7.4.1.

Recall that A_{n}=left{{x|{x=overrightarrow{a}•overrightarrow{AB}}}right}, where overrightarrow{a} is a vector between any two vertices of a regular prism with edge length 1 and 2n vertices, and overrightarrow{AB} is a vector representing one edge of the base.1. Vector Representation: The vector overrightarrow{a} can be represented as either the sum of vectors along the edges of the base or as a sum of a base vector and a vector perpendicular to the base. This is due to the structure of the regular prism.2. Dot Product Interpretation: The dot product overrightarrow{a}•overrightarrow{AB} can be interpreted geometrically as the projection of overrightarrow{a} onto overrightarrow{AB}. This means we are looking for how the vector overrightarrow{a} projects onto the edge vector overrightarrow{AB}, which can simplify our analysis.3.

This occurs when the base of the prism forms a shape that minimizes these projections.4. Case Analysis:   - Square Base (n=4): In a square base (regular prism with n=4), the vectors connecting points on the base project onto overrightarrow{AB} as either overrightarrow{0} (for vectors perpendicular to overrightarrow{AB}) or as vectors parallel (or anti-parallel) to overrightarrow{AB} with magnitude |AB|^{2}=1. This results in possible x values of 0, 1, and -1, totaling 3 distinct values.   - Triangular Base (n=3): For a triangular base, the analysis yields 4 distinct x values.   - Pentagonal Base and Beyond (n=5, 6, cdots): For bases with more than 4 sides, the number of distinct x values exceeds 3.5. Conclusion: The minimum number of elements in A_{n}, which is 3, occurs when n=4, corresponding to a square base.

Find the smallest real number m, for which there exist real numbers a, b such that the inequalityleft|x^{2}+a x+bright| leqq mholds for every x inlangle 0,2rangle.","solution":"SOLUTION. At the outset, let's realize that no negative number m meets the requirements of the problem (the absolute value is a non-negative number).Let's interpret the problem geometrically. The condition from the problem states that the graph of some quadratic function y=x^{2}+a x+b on the interval langle 0,2rangle must lie within a horizontal strip between the lines y=+m and y=-m (Fig. 1). The question then is: Into what narrowest strip of this kind can the graph of such a function be \\"compressed\\" on the interval langle 0,2rangle?![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_ef3d84e533bc09b28859g-03.jpg?height=334&width=623&top_left_y=2197&top_left_x=722)Fig. 1According to Fig. 1, a good candidate for the narrowest strip seems to be the functionf(x)=(x-1)^{2}-frac{1}{2}=x^{2}-2 x+frac{1}{2},for which a=-2 and b=frac{1}{2}, and which, as we will soon show, satisfies the inequalities -frac{1}{2} leqq f(x) leqq frac{1}{2} on the interval langle 0,2rangle.Indeed, due to the expression f(x)=(x-1)^{2}-frac{1}{2}, these are the inequalities 0 leqq(x-1)^{2} leqq 1, which hold simultaneously precisely for x inlangle 0,2rangle. The quadratic function f(x)=x^{2}-2 x+frac{1}{2} thus meets the condition of the problem for m=frac{1}{2}.In the second part of the solution, we will show that no quadratic function satisfying the condition exists for any m<frac{1}{2}.A key fact for us will be that for any function f(x)=x^{2}+a x+b, at least one of the differences f(0)-f(1) and f(2)-f(1) is greater than or equal to one. From this, it follows that the width 2 m of the enclosing strip must be greater than or equal to one, and values of m<frac{1}{2} can indeed be excluded. If, for example, f(0)-f(1) geqq 1 (in the case f(2)-f(1) geqq 1 we would proceed similarly), we obtain the desired estimate 2 m geqq 1 easily from the generally valid triangle inequality |a-b| leqq|a|+|b|:1 leqq|f(0)-f(1)| leqq|f(0)|+|f(1)| leqq 2 mTo complete the entire solution, it remains to prove the validity of at least one of the inequalities f(0)-f(1) geqq 1 or f(2)-f(1) geqq 1 for any f(x)=x^{2}+a x+b. Sincef(0)=b, quad f(1)=1+a+b, quad f(2)=4+2 a+bwe havebegin{aligned}& f(0)-f(1)=-1-a geqq 1 quad Leftrightarrow quad a leqq-2, & f(2)-f(1)=3+a geqq 1 quad Leftrightarrow quad a geqq-2 .end{aligned}At least one of the inequalities f(0)-f(1) geqq 1 or f(2)-f(1) geqq 1 thus holds always (regardless of the choice of numbers a, b).Answer: The sought minimum value of m is frac{1}{2}.SUPPLEMENTARY AND ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS:N1.

We will prove that n can be 0,1,2,3, ldots, 98. First, we describe the situation where exactly n people remain after the last gong strike.For n>0, divide all 100 people into groups A and B. Let group A contain n people who know all 99 other participants. Group B contains 100-n people who do not know each other but know all the people in group A (so each person in group B has n acquaintances).After the (n+1)-th gong strike, all people in group B leave, which means the people in group A still have exactly n-1 acquaintances. Since the n-th gong strike has already passed, it follows that all people in group A will remain until the end of the party.The value n=0 is achieved when everyone knows each other (so everyone will leave after the 100th gong strike).It is easy to notice that n<100 because the person with the fewest acquaintances must leave the party.Finally, we show that n=99 is not possible. Assume the contrary, i.e., that exactly one person X leaves the party before the end. As before, this person has the fewest acquaintances. Since no one else has left after X, we conclude that everyone knows X - if some person Y does not know X, then the number of people Y knows does not change with X's departure, so Y would also have to leave at some point. This shows that X has 99 acquaintances, and thus everyone else also has 99 acquaintances, which is a contradiction."},{"problem":"If the function f(x) = x log_{2}(2^{x} + 1) + ax is an odd function, then a = boxed{-frac{1}{2}}.","solution":"Since f(x) is an odd function, we have:[f(-x) = -f(x)]Applying this property to the function, we get:[-x log_{2}(2^{-x} + 1) - ax = -x log_{2}(2^{x} + 1) + ax]To solve for a, rearrange the equation as:[-x log_{2}(2^{-x} + 1) - ax + x log_{2}(2^{x} + 1) - ax = 0]Using a property of logarithms, combine the logarithmic terms:[-x left( log_{2}(2^{x} + 1) + log_{2}left(frac{1}{2^{x}} + 1right) right) - 2ax = 0]Note that log_{2}(2^{x} + 1) + log_{2}left(frac{1}{2^{x}} + 1right) simplifies to:[log_{2}((2^{x} + 1)(1 + frac{1}{2^{x}})) = log_{2}(2^{x} + 1 + 1 + frac{1}{2^{x}})][log_{2}(2^{x} + 2 + frac{1}{2^{x}}) = log_{2}(2^{x} + 2 + 2^{-x})][log_{2}(2 + 2^{x} + 2^{-x})]Since log_{2}(2) = 1, the equation simplifies to:[-x + 2ax = 0]Combining like terms, we find:[2ax = x]If x neq 0, we can divide by x to isolate a:[2a = 1]Solving for a, we see that a must be equal to:[a = frac{1}{2}]However, this contradicts the concept that f(x) should be an odd function, which implies symmetry about the origin and thus, a should be negative.

Let ABC be a triangle with circumradius R = 1. The orthocenter of triangle ABC is denoted by H, and the circumcenter is denoted by O. We are given that the center of the circle passing through A, C, and H lies on the circumcircle of triangle ABC.2. Let K be the center of the circle passing through A, C, and H. Since K lies on the circumcircle of triangle ABC, K must be the midpoint of the arc AC that does not contain B. This is because the center of the circle passing through A, C, and H must lie on the perpendicular bisector of AC and also on the circumcircle of triangle ABC.3. Since K is the midpoint of the arc AC, it is equidistant from A and C. Therefore, KA = KC. Also, K lies on the perpendicular bisector of AH and CH.4. Consider the triangle AHC. Since K is the circumcenter of triangle AHC, the radius of the circumcircle of triangle AHC is KA = KC. Let M be the midpoint of BC. The length AH can be expressed as AH = 2R cos A = 2 cos A because R = 1.5. Since K is the midpoint of the arc AC, the angle angle AKC = 180^circ - angle AOC = 180^circ - 2B.

The ratio of the hypotenuse to the shorter leg in these smaller triangles is exactly 2: 1. We will use these general observations in our problem in several ways:First, the line A C is the axis of symmetry of triangle E C F, so angle A C E has a measure of 30^{circ}. Second, the ratio of the hypotenuse to the shorter leg in the right triangle A B C is given as 2: 1, so it is half of an equilateral triangle, with the remaining internal angles B A C and A C B having measures of 30^{circ} and 60^{circ}.From this, we deduce that angle B C E has a measure of 30^{circ} (the difference between angles A C B and A C E).

With the given notation, we have 6=frac{sqrt{3}}{2} a, so a=4 sqrt{3}.With knowledge of Thales' theorem, or the converse theorem, the size of angle A C B can be derived as follows: Since the angles at vertices B and D are right angles, both lie on a circle with diameter A C.

In particular, it reaches its maximum either at x=0 or at x=1.If x=0, we are reduced to maximizing y^{2} z-z^{2} y, in which case the function y rightarrow y^{2} z-z^{2} y is again convex, so the maximum is reached for y=0 or y=1. For y=0, y^{2} z-z^{2} y=0, and for y=1, y^{2} z-z^{2} y=z-z^{2}, which is at most frac{1}{4} at z=frac{1}{2}. In this case, the maximum is therefore frac{1}{4}.If x=1, we are reduced to maximizing y-y^{2}+z^{2}-z+y^{2} z-z^{2} y. Again, z rightarrow y-y^{2}+z^{2}-z+y^{2} z-z^{2} y is convex (as a polynomial of degree 2 with a leading coefficient 1-y geqslant 0), so it reaches its maximum either at z=0 or at z=1. We are again reduced to maximizing y-y^{2}, and we again find that the value of the maximum is frac{1}{4}."},{"problem":"2.1.1.

Now assume mathrm{a} geq 11, that is, mathrm{a} is a prime number no less than 11.First, prove two lemmas.Lemma 1: a+1 is a power of 2.Proof of Lemma 1: If mathrm{a}+1 has an odd prime factor mathrm{p}, then mathrm{p} leq frac{mathrm{a}+1}{2}, so frac{mathrm{p}+1}{2} in{0,1, ldots, mathrm{a}-1}, hence 4left(frac{p+1}{2}right)^{2}+a is a prime number. But 4left(frac{p+1}{2}right)^{2}+a=(p+1)^{2}+a equiv 1+a equiv 0(bmod p), and 4left(frac{p+1}{2}right)^{2}+a=(p+1)^{2}+a>p, so 4left(frac{p+1}{2}right)^{2}+a is a composite number, which leads to a contradiction. Therefore, a+1 is a power of 2.Lemma 2: a+9 is a power of 2.Proof of Lemma 2: If mathrm{a}+9 has an odd prime factor mathrm{p}, then mathrm{p} leq frac{mathrm{a}+9}{2}, so frac{mathrm{p}+3}{2} in{0,1, ldots, mathrm{a}-1}, hence 4left(frac{p+3}{2}right)^{2}+a is a prime number. But 4left(frac{p+3}{2}right)^{2}+a=(p+3)^{2}+a equiv 9+a equiv 0(bmod p), and 4left(frac{p+3}{2}right)^{2}+a=(p+3)^{2}+a>p, so 4left(frac{p+3}{2}right)^{2}+a is a composite number, which leads to a contradiction. Therefore, a+9 is a power of 2.Now, return to the original problem.According to the above analysis, mathrm{a} is a prime number no less than 11, a+1 is a power of 2, and a+9 is a power of 2. Let left{begin{array}{l}a+1=2^{alpha}  a+9=2^{beta}end{array}right., then 2^{alpha}+2^{3}=2^{beta}. Therefore, it can only be left{begin{array}{l}alpha=3  beta=4end{array}right., thus mathrm{a}=2^{3}-1. This contradicts mathrm{a} geq 11.In conclusion, the values of mathrm{a} that satisfy the condition are 3 or 7.Note: In fact, for any odd prime mathrm{p}<mathrm{a},left{4 mathrm{n}^{2} mid mathrm{n} in{0,1,2, ldots, mathrm{a}-1}right} can cover all quadratic residues modulo mathrm{p}, so for any square number b^{2}, a+b^{2} cannot have an odd prime factor less than a (otherwise, if a+b^{2} has an odd prime factor p less than a, then there exists an integer n in{0,1,2, ldots, a-1}, such that p midleft(4 n^{2}+aright), thus 4 n^{2}+a cannot be a prime number). Therefore, when b^{2}<a, and b^{2}+a is composite, b^{2}+a can only be a power of 2. This is the lemma used in the above proof."},{"problem":"7.1. Pasha and Sasha made three identical toy cars.

Since A, B, and C are the internal angles of an acute triangle ABC, we have cos B = frac{3}{5}. Therefore, sin B = sqrt{1 - cos^2 B} = frac{4}{5}. Given that f(C) = -frac{1}{4}, we can writefrac{sqrt{3}}{2}cosleft(2C + frac{pi}{6}right) + frac{1}{2} = -frac{1}{4}.Solving for cosleft(2C + frac{pi}{6}right), we obtain cosleft(2C + frac{pi}{6}right) = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. This implies 2C + frac{pi}{6} = frac{5pi}{6}, so C = frac{pi}{3}.Finally, to find sin A, we use the sine angle sum identity:sin A = sinleft(frac{2pi}{3} - Bright) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cos B + frac{1}{2}sin B.Substituting the values of cos B and sin B, we getsin A = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cdot frac{3}{5} + frac{1}{2} cdot frac{4}{5} = boxed{frac{4 + 3sqrt{3}}{10}}."},{"problem":"4.

Given that ( b_n ) belongs to the sequence ( (a_n) ), and since ( (a_n) ) is strictly increasing, we have ( a_n < b_n < a_{n+3} ). Therefore, ( b_n ) must be either ( a_{n+1} ) or ( a_{n+2} ).2. Assume first that ( b_n = a_{n+1} ) for every ( n ). This implies:   [   a_{n+1} = frac{a_n + a_{n+1} + a_{n+2} + a_{n+3}}{4}   ]   Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:   [   4a_{n+1} = a_n + a_{n+1} + a_{n+2} + a_{n+3}   ]   Rearranging terms, we obtain:   [   3a_{n+1} = a_n + a_{n+2} + a_{n+3}   ]   Solving for ( a_{n+3} ), we get:   [   a_{n+3} = 3a_{n+1} - a_n - a_{n+2}   ]3. To solve this linear recurrence relation, we assume a solution of the form ( a_n = alpha + beta r^n + gamma s^n ). Substituting into the recurrence relation, we get:   [   alpha + beta r^{n+3} + gamma s^{n+3} = 3(alpha + beta r^{n+1} + gamma s^{n+1}) - (alpha + beta r^n + gamma s^n) - (alpha + beta r^{n+2} + gamma s^{n+2})   ]   Simplifying, we find the characteristic equation:   [   r^3 = 3r - 1 - r^2   ]   Rearranging, we get:   [   r^3 + r^2 - 3r + 1 = 0   ]   Factoring, we find:   [   (r + 1 - sqrt{2})(r + 1 + sqrt{2})(r - 1) = 0   ]   Thus, the roots are ( r = -1 + sqrt{2} ), ( r = -1 - sqrt{2} ), and ( r = 1 ).4. Therefore, the general solution to the recurrence relation is:   [   a_n = alpha + beta (-1 - sqrt{2})^n + gamma (-1 + sqrt{2})^n   ]   Since ( a_n ) is unbounded and strictly increasing, we must have ( beta neq 0 ) and ( gamma neq 0 ). However, if ( beta neq 0 ), the term ( beta (-1 - sqrt{2})^n ) will dominate and oscillate in sign, which contradicts the positivity of ( a_n ). Hence, ( beta = 0 ).5. Now, consider the case where ( b_n = a_{n+2} ) for some ( n ). This implies:   [   a_{n+2} = frac{a_n + a_{n+1} + a_{n+2} + a_{n+3}}{4}   ]   Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:   [   4a_{n+2} = a_n + a_{n+1} + a_{n+2} + a_{n+3}   ]   Rearranging terms, we obtain:   [   3a_{n+2} = a_n + a_{n+1} + a_{n+3}   ]   Solving for ( a_{n+3} ), we get:   [   a_{n+3} = 3a_{n+2} - a_n - a_{n+1}   ]6. Solving this linear recurrence relation similarly, we assume a solution of the form ( a_n = alpha + beta r^n + gamma s^n ). Substituting into the recurrence relation, we get:   [   alpha + beta r^{n+3} + gamma s^{n+3} = 3(alpha + beta r^{n+2} + gamma s^{n+2}) - (alpha + beta r^n + gamma s^n) - (alpha + beta r^{n+1} + gamma s^{n+1})   ]   Simplifying, we find the characteristic equation:   [   r^3 = 3r^2 - r - 1   ]   Rearranging, we get:   [   r^3 - 3r^2 + r + 1 = 0   ]   Factoring, we find:   [   (r - 1 - sqrt{2})(r - 1 + sqrt{2})(r - 1) = 0   ]   Thus, the roots are ( r = 1 + sqrt{2} ), ( r = 1 - sqrt{2} ), and ( r = 1 ).7. Therefore, the general solution to the recurrence relation is:   [   a_n = alpha + beta (1 + sqrt{2})^n + gamma (1 - sqrt{2})^n   ]   Since ( a_n ) is unbounded and strictly increasing, we must have ( beta neq 0 ). The term ( gamma (1 - sqrt{2})^n ) will tend to 0 as ( n to infty ), so it does not affect the unboundedness.8.

Total number of ways to select 4 products out of 100: This is a combination problem where we are choosing 4 items from a total of 100 without regard to the order in which they are selected. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}, where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. Therefore, the total number of ways to select 4 products from 100 is given by C_{100}^{4} = dfrac{100!}{4!(100-4)!}.2. Number of ways to select exactly one second-class product: To have exactly one second-class product, we select 1 out of the 10 second-class products and 3 out of the 90 first-class products.

You are allowed to select any rectangle with the mouse (the sides of the rectangle must lie on the grid lines), and then click the mouse button, which will change the color of each square in the rectangle (black to white, white to black). Find the minimum number of operations required to make all the squares on the chessboard the same color.(1998, United States of America Mathematical Olympiad)","solution":"Analysis: If we consider \\"all cells of the same color,\\" it would be very difficult (because too many objects can obscure the essential relationships), leading to the idea of adopting a local thinking strategy.First local thinking: Transform \\"all cells of the same color\\" into \\"any two adjacent cells of the same color.\\" Thus, we only need to focus on some adjacent cells. For convenience, we call two adjacent cells a \\"pair.\\"Under what circumstances will a pair be of the same color? This is clearly equivalent to the parity of the number of flips of the two cells being different. Therefore, we define the sum of the number of flips of two cells as the \\"characteristic value\\" of the pair. Then, we only need all pairs to have an odd characteristic value. This way, the study of the problem's nature becomes a numerical study: we only need the characteristic values of all pairs to be odd after several operations.Second local thinking: Note thatthe number of operationsgeqslant the sum of the number of times the characteristic values of all pairs change divthe number of times they are counted repeatedly.If we consider all pairs, some pairs are counted too many times, making the estimation difficult, so we should appropriately select some pairs to study: only consider the pairs around the edges of the board (called \\"edge pairs\\").Third local thinking: Considering all edge pairs also encounters difficulties; we further divide them into two parts: separately examine all vertical and horizontal edge pairs. This solves the problem.Solution: Call two adjacent cells a pair, and the sum of the number of flips of the two cells in the pair is called the characteristic value of the pair. Since the characteristic value of all pairs is initially 0 (even), after several operations, all cells on the board will be of the same color. Therefore, the parity of the characteristic values of all pairs must change an odd number of times (at least once) during the operations.A 98 times 98 board has 2 times 97 vertical edge pairs, and the parity of their characteristic values must change at least 2 times 97 times.Consider each operation; to change the parity of the characteristic value of a pair, the pair must have exactly one cell within the selected rectangle. However, for any rectangle, at most 4 cells outside the rectangle are adjacent to cells inside the rectangle, thus changing the parity of at most 4 edge pairs. Therefore, the number of operations to change the characteristic values of vertical edge pairs (called vertical operations) is at least left[frac{2 times 97}{4}right]+1=49 times.By symmetry, the number of operations to change the characteristic values of horizontal edge pairs (called horizontal operations) is also at least 49 times.Thus, to make all cells on the board the same color, at least 98 operations are required.Next, we need to construct 98 operations to make all cells on the board the same color. Consider the condition for equality. If a total of 98 operations are performed, then from the above discussion, it must be that there are 49 horizontal operations and 49 vertical operations, and each horizontal operation (or vertical operation) changes the parity of 4 horizontal pairs (or vertical pairs). This leads to a specific method of operation:First, change the color of the odd-numbered rows (the first operation changes 2 vertical pairs, and the rest change 4 vertical pairs), then change the color of the even-numbered columns (the last operation changes 2 horizontal pairs, and the rest change 4 horizontal pairs), making all cells the same color, with a total of 98 operations.In summary, the minimum number of operations is 98."},{"problem":"4.

Thus, the profit increases with x within the given range.At the upper limit of the range, x = 15, we calculate the maximum profit:begin{align*}w_{text{max}} &= -5(15 - 19)^2 + 605 &= -5(-4)^2 + 605 &= -5(16) + 605 &= -80 + 605 &= 525end{align*}Therefore, when the selling price per item is boxed{15} yuan, the daily sales profit is maximized at boxed{525} yuan."},{"problem":"Problem 11-1.

It remains to prove that there are no other values that are roots for any lambda (although this is obvious). Indeed, t^{2}-(lambda-1) t+(10-lambda)=0 implies t=frac{lambda-1 pm sqrt{lambda^{2}+2 lambda-39}}{2}. Take any pair of values of lambda for which the discriminant takes the same positive value, for example, for lambda=10 and lambda=-12 we have t in{0,9} and t in{-11,-2} - there are no intersections. Therefore, the answer is x=1.Second Solution. Subtract the second equation from the first, transforming it, we get (a-1)(b-1)(c-1)=0. From this, it follows that one of a, b, c is equal to one.

Turán's Theorem Application:   - For ( n = 7 ) and ( r = 3 ), Turán's theorem tells us that the maximum number of edges in a graph with 7 vertices that does not contain a ( K_3 ) (triangle) is given by ( T(7, 2) ), where ( T(n, r-1) ) is the Turán graph.   - The number of edges in ( T(7, 2) ) is ( leftlfloor frac{7^2}{4} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{49}{4} rightrfloor = 12 ).3. Minimum Number of Matches:   - The total number of possible matches (edges) in a complete graph ( K_7 ) is ( binom{7}{2} = 21 ).   - The minimum number of matches required is the total number of edges minus the maximum number of edges that can be missing without violating the condition.   - Therefore, the minimum number of matches is ( 21 - 12 = 9 ). Part (b): General ( n )1. Graph Representation:   - We represent the ( n ) teams as vertices of a graph.   - We need to ensure that among any three vertices, at least one edge exists.2. Turán's Theorem Application:   - For general ( n ) and ( r = 3 ), Turán's theorem tells us that the maximum number of edges in a graph with ( n ) vertices that does not contain a ( K_3 ) (triangle) is given by ( T(n, 2) ).   - The number of edges in ( T(n, 2) ) is ( leftlfloor frac{n^2}{4} rightrfloor ).3. Minimum Number of Matches:   - The total number of possible matches (edges) in a complete graph ( K_n ) is ( binom{n}{2} = frac{n(n-1)}{2} ).   - The minimum number of matches required is the total number of edges minus the maximum number of edges that can be missing without violating the condition.   - Therefore, the minimum number of matches is ( frac{n(n-1)}{2} - leftlfloor frac{n^2}{4} rightrfloor ).Conclusion:[boxed{frac{n(n-1)}{2} - leftlfloor frac{n^2}{4} rightrfloor}]"},{"problem":"A line passing through the focus F of the parabola y^{2}=4x at an angle of frac{pi}{3} intersects the parabola at points A and B (with point A above the x-axis), then the ratio frac{|AF|}{|BF|}=A: 2B: frac{5}{2}C: 3D: 4","solution":"AnalysisThis problem mainly examines the positional relationship between a line and a parabola.SolutionLet A(x_{1}, y_{1}) and B(x_{2}, y_{2}), and assume x_{1} > x_{2}.It is known that the equation of line AB isy= sqrt{3}x- frac{ sqrt{3}}{2}p.

If the number 2 is not a divisor of the number n, then the number 4 is not either, which is impossible. Therefore, the number 2 is also a divisor of the number n.1 pointNow we have two possibilities. The first possibility is that d_{1}=1, d_{2}=2, d_{3}=3, and d_{4}=5. Notice that in this case, the number 6 is also a divisor of n, so we conclude that d_{5}=6 must hold.From the second condition, we have that d_{7}=d_{5}^{2}+1=37, so the number n has at least 4 different prime factors (2,3,5,37), which means it has at least 16 divisors, which is a contradiction.The second possibility is that d_{1}=1, d_{2}=2, d_{3}=4, and d_{4}=5. We see that in this case, the number 10 is also a divisor of n, which means d_{5} leqslant 10.Since 3 is not a divisor of n, d_{5} cannot be 6 or 9 either.We need to check the possibilities that d_{5} is 7, 8, or 10.If d_{5}=7, then d_{7}=7^{2}+1=50, so there should be other divisors of 50, such as 10 and 25, between d_{5} and d_{7}, which is impossible. If d_{5}=8, then d_{7}=8^{2}+1=65, and similarly, we get a contradiction because there should be the number 13 and the number 26 between d_{5} and d_{7}.If d_{5}=10, then d_{7}=10^{2}+1=101, which is a prime number. Since n is divisible by 4 and 5, the only possibility would be d_{6}=20.The divisors of the number n can be paired so that their product is equal to n, i.e., d_{i} cdot d_{13-i}=n, for each i in{1,2, ldots, 12}. In particular, it must be n=d_{6} cdot d_{7}=2020.It remains to verify that the number n=2020 indeed satisfies all the conditions of the problem, i.e., that there are no other divisors between 20 and 101 and that it has exactly 12 divisors in total. Both conditions can be easily verified by listing all the divisors of 2020. They are, in order,1,2,4,5,10,20,101,202,404,505,1010,2020Note: Once it is concluded that d_{5} leqslant 10, it is also possible to conclude in the following way. Notice that the number 20 is also a divisor of the number n. If we assume that d_{5}d_{4}=5. Therefore, it must be d_{5}=10.

Construct the direction field and indicate the approximate general solution of this equation.","solution":"Solution. We have f(x, y)=x. This function is defined for all values of x and y (it does not depend on y). This means that D=mathbb{R}^{2}, i.e., the domain D is the entire plane O x y. At all points on the plane where x=0 (this is the O y axis), we have y^{prime}=0. This means that at points on the O y axis, the field is horizontal (on Fig. 4.1, this is depicted by short horizontal strokes). At points on the plane where x=1 (this is the line x=1), we have y^{prime}=1, i.e., the tangents to all curves intersecting the line x=1 form a 45^{circ} angle with the O x axis. At points on the line x=-1, the field (set of tangents) forms a 135^{circ} angle with the positive direction of the O x axis, and so on. The lines x=K are the isoclines of the direction field of the equation, and these directions form angles with the positive direction of the O x axis whose tangents are equal to K. Thus, the direction field is constructed. If an integral curve is drawn through any point, say, through the origin (0,0), then at the point (0,0), this curve has a horizontal tangent, and in the neighborhood of the point x=0, to the right of it, the slope of the integral curve is positive; it intersects the line x=1 at a 45^{circ} angle, the line x=sqrt{3} at a 60^{circ} angle, the line x=2 at a larger angle, and so on. If this integral curve is extended to the left, the slopes of the tangents change such that the line x=-1 is intersected at a 135^{circ} angle, the line x=-sqrt{3} at a 120^{circ} angle, and so forth. Since the field is symmetric with respect to the O y axis, the integral curves will be similar. Similarly, an integral curve passing through another point on the plane, for example, through the point (0,1), can be constructed.

What are the height, width, and diagonal length of the door? In this problem, the height of the door is ______.","solution":"To solve the problem, we start by letting the length of the pole be x feet. This allows us to express the dimensions of the door in terms of x. Specifically, the width of the door is (x-4) feet, the height of the door is (x-2) feet, and the diagonal of the door is equal to the length of the pole, which is x feet. Given these relationships, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to the door, which states that the square of the diagonal of a right-angled triangle (or in this case, the door) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the width and the height of the door). Therefore, we have:[x^2 = (x-4)^2 + (x-2)^2]Expanding the squares on the right side of the equation gives us:[x^2 = (x^2 - 8x + 16) + (x^2 - 4x + 4)]Combining like terms, we get:[x^2 = 2x^2 - 12x + 20]Rearranging the equation to bring all terms to one side, we obtain:[0 = x^2 - 12x + 20]This is a quadratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 1, b = -12, and c = 20. Solving this quadratic equation, we find that the solutions for x are:[x = 2 quad text{(which we discard, as it does not make physical sense in this context)}][x = 10]Therefore, the length of the pole, and thus the diagonal of the door, is 10 feet.

Since at least one of 4 or 8 is contained in S, we have 4 | m.We would like to prove that 5 notin S, so for the sake of contradiction, let us suppose that 5 in S. Then 5cdot 4 = 20 | m so the units digit of m is 0. Since the number has two distinct digits, each appearing twice, another digit of m must be 0. Since Mr. Jones can't be 00 years old, the last two digits can't be 00. Therefore m must be of the form d0d0, where d is a digit. Since m is divisible by 9, the sum of the digits of m must be divisible by 9 (see [ Divisibility rules for 9](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Divisibility_rules/Rule_for_3_and_9_proof)).

Since 11cdot504 = 5544 and 5544 is the only 4 digit multiple of 504 that fits all the conditions of the license plate's number, the license plate's number is 5544.)Solution 2Alternatively, we can see that if one of Mr. Jones' children is of the age 5, then the license plate will have to end in the digit 0 . The license plate cannot end in the digit 5 as 2 is a factor of the number, so it must be even. This means that the license plate would have to have two 0 digits, and would either be of the form XX00 or X0X0 (X being the other digit in the license plate) . The condition XX00 is impossible as Mr. Jones can't be 00 years old. If we separate the second condition, X0X0 into its prime factors, we get Xcdot 10cdot 101. 101 is prime, and therefore can't account for allowing X0X0 being evenly divisible by the childrens' ages.  The 10 accounts for the 5 and one factor of 2. This leaves X, but no single digit number contains all the prime factors besides 5 and 2 of the childrens' ages, thus 5 boxed{ B } can't be one of the childrens' ages.Solution 3Another way to do the problem is by the process of elimination. The only possible correct choices are the highest powers of each prime, 2^3=8, 3^2=9, 5^1=5, and 7^1=7, since indivisibility by any powers lower than these means indivisibility by a higher power of the prime (for example, indivisibility by 2^2=4 means indivisibility by 2^3=8). Since the number is divisible by 9, it is not the answer, and the digits have to add up to 9. Let (a,b) be the digits: since 2cdot(a+b) | 9, (a+b)|9.

It is known that if 0 leqslant k leqslant n, then binom{n}{k}=frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}. Let's prove this identity: for this, we will show that n!=binom{n}{k} k!(n-k)!.To do this, we will count the number of permutations of {1, ldots, n} in two different ways. There are n! permutations (n choices for the image of 1, n-1 for the image of 2, etc.). But we can also construct each permutation as follows: we choose {sigma(1), ldots, sigma(k)}, the set of the first k images of sigma (there are binom{n}{k} choices), then we choose an order for these images (k! possibilities), and finally an order for the remaining n-k images ((n-k)! possibilities). Therefore, we have binom{n}{k} k!(n-k)! different permutations, each produced by this method, hence the equality.For counting stories, to show an equality, a sum is interpreted as an exclusive or: if we sum positive integers a_{1}+cdots+a_{k}, we often interpret a_{i} as the number of possibilities for case i, knowing that each case is exclusive and that they cover all possibilities. If we multiply certain quantities, it should be interpreted as a successive or parallel choice of certain quantities.Often, double counting pairs, triplets, or other sets proves particularly effective. It is important to try this even on simple cases, as more elaborate double counting ideas can appear in more complex problems (for example, the C2 2021 is a good example of a problem where double counting ideas appear). To double count pairs, often we look at the first term of the pair fixed, how many second terms are possible, and vice versa, giving two different equalities/inequalities.The exercises in this TD are mostly taken from those of 2019 and 2021, available here: https://maths-olympiques.fr/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PolycopieV1-1.pdf https://maths-olympiques.fr/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Poly-2021-Valbonne.pdf. It is required to do them without calculation, without using the binomial coefficient formula with factorials, in order to try to properly implement the double counting method."},{"problem":"The greatest common divisor of 225 and 135 is (　　)A: 5B: 9C: 15D: 45","solution":"Since 225 div 135 = 1 remainder 90,  135 div 90 = 1 remainder 45,  90 div 45 = 2 with no remainder,  therefore, the greatest common divisor of 225 and 135 is 45.  Hence, the correct answer is boxed{D}.  Analysis: By dividing the larger number by the smaller one, we get a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 90.

We will prove that any arrangement of zeros and ones in the cells of the lower left corner square of size (n-1) times(n-1) can be uniquely extended to fill the entire table with zeros and ones, satisfying the conditions of the problem. Consider any of the lower n-1 rows of the table. If there is an even number of zeros in the left n-1 cells, then according to the condition, a 0 must be placed in the remaining right cell, and if there is an odd number of zeros, then a 1 must be placed. This is always possible to do, and in a unique way. Similarly, the upper cells of the left n-1 columns of the table are uniquely filled. Note that the parity of the number of ones written in the right column coincides with the total number of ones in the cells of the lower left corner square of size (n-1) times(n-1) and coincides with the parity of the number of ones written in the top row of the table. Therefore, to satisfy the condition of the problem, a 0 must be placed in the top right cell of the table if all these three numbers are even, and a 1 in the opposite case. This is also always possible and is done uniquely.
