Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. Even though it requires a physical examnation of the groin area and the patient as a whole, from your history, it seems to be persistence of some kind of chronic infection in the area. If I were your doctor, after a physical examinaton, I would advise you for a complete blood count, ESR, VDRL test, Blood sugar test, an HIV and HbsAg test, gram staining and cuture sensitivity test of the discharge and a Mantoux test. If the reports of these investigations come out to be inconclusive, I would consider a biopsy of the tissue for a histopathology and the final line of management would depend on the reports. Till then, I would advise you not to fiddle with the lesion, and take proper care of it with regular dressings and a course of broad spectrum antibiotics with an anti inflammatory drug to be advised by the treating docotr for a possible symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I've recently noticed a roughly 2cm in diameter red (probably because I've touched it), solid/firm lump next the bottom of my tailbone. It is not on top of the bone itself, but rather to the left of it, and on top of the skin there. It is painful when I touch it. There is no noticeable blood, pus, holes (as in the case of maybe a pimple or a bug bite). I'm quite worried about this. Medical history: When I was a baby I had a condition where my intestines overlapped/squeezed my stomach? and I quickly threw up any bit of food I was given. I had a blood clot in brain a few years ago. Maybe 3 years ago, excluding for the most part this past year, I would feel as if my heart would skip beats randomly, It would be normal, then out of nowhere I would feel a very strong beat, and usually get quite dizzy, this would last anywhere from just one beat to continuing for a few minutes, and would happen on an off almost everyday for those two years, and it still occasionally happens now. Starting maybe last August my bowel movements completely changed, I would frequently (up to 14 times a day) have a sudden and painful urge to defecate. It was often diarrhoea, or at least not completely solid. I did start eating much more and changed a lot of my diet maybe two months prior to that, but had no symptoms prior to August. I went to the doctor for this, got a catscan and they found nothing. The painful frequent bowel movements continued, and I think maybe last January, or February the feces became a bit more solid and it wasnt so painful, but still frequent. Lately, I've been having some stomach pains in my upper stomach (right below my rib cage), the frequent defecating also seems to once again be very noticeable. Nearly 3 or 4 minutes after I wake up, I get the sudden painful urge to defecate. And the same thing happens almost every 2 hours for the rest of the day.Thanks","Doctor":"HI,Dear, Thanks for the query from you for your 2 cm , red painful hard-lump at the tailbone? .1-I am happy that you are serious to know why this painful tailbone- lump occurs?2-In my opinion this 2cm sized red firm solid painful lump is of the -infected pilonidal cyst and is infected with the cellulitis and induration of the tissue in it and around.3-Though the medical history is elucidative,does not appear to be relevant to the main lump question and is diverting from the main question and hence needs no comments.4-But would explain, why this red lump occured now-is due to the extensive stress leading to the infective pilonidal sinus to crop up on the tail bone.5-I would advise General surgeon to drain the pilonidal infected cyst , and if it recurrs, then it may need excision of the pilonidal sinus with excision of the tail bone-coccyx for the permanent releif from the red lump .6-Hence I would suggest you to go to ER Surgeon or the orthosurgeon for the evaluation and treatment of such cases.8-Hope this would resolve the causative worry of the patient in question .If treated on this line, the fearing   patient , should not worry you much.9-Hope this would solve your worry of the red painful lump.10-Wellcome to HCM for any more query."},{"Patient":"I have developed a hard peas sized lump near the tip of my tonue.

Rest2. Application of ice or cold pack for 20 minutes at a time, 4 - 8 times/day.3. Compress (Compression can be achieved by using elastic bandages.)4. Elevate (Elevation of the injured area above the level of the heart )The pain of a hematoma is usually due to the inflammation surrounding the blood and may be treated with pain medications like Ibuprofen (if he is not taking blood thinner). Ibuprofen is  contraindicated  because of the high risk of bleeding. Acetaminophen can be a better choice.If hematoma does not resolve, the pressure within it can increase to the point that a “compartment syndrome” can occur. In this situation, the blood supply of the muscle is compromised and the muscle and other structures such as nerves can be permanently damaged.

My question is that, is there a type of surgery that can be done to completely eliminate the chance of these boils from recurring..and the success rate..or maybe a pinpoint underlying cause or solution to my problem..any help would be a blessing..thank you","Doctor":"Hi I am doctor Fahim and I will help you with your problemI can understand your feeling because acne is such a chronic disease that keeps on coming despite best treatment. Nice to hear that its subsided. Boils behind ear are usually not related with acne. As you said that your doctor told you that its staph infection. Staphylococcus Aureus is the main bacteria found on over skin. Most skin infection is because of it. Its treatment is antibiotic cover along with anti inflammatory drugs.There is no surgery to completely eliminate this problem, rather it is reserved for complication of this problem if not responding to medications. It can be prevented by maintaining good hygiene, some routine investigation like plasma glucose level and blood complete picture to   know about the underlying disease.I hope it will help you, do rate my answer if you like it.Regards"},{"Patient":"I play basketball and i had this brown/black bump on the side of my big toe (on both feet) and it wasnt going away. I thought it was a bruise but it didnt hurt... So i took a pair of scissors and just cut it a little bit and brown juice came out. It was disgusting. Ew. So what is happening :(","Doctor":"Hi I am doctor Fahim and I will help you with your queriesThe most common on the side of big toe is IGTN which is In Growing Toe Nail. It is most common in sportsman with tight shoe wear because of the continuous pressure on side of big toe.

The one uncommon thing in your case is that i doesn't hurts. you need to visit a general surgeon who after examining, may diagnose it as IGTN.

I am female, 22 years old. I am very hygenic (I shower every single day, and sometimes even have a clear-water, no bubble bath, bath in the evenings too). I suffer from extremely sore, painful lumps on my vagina, and general genital area. They are raised and usually quite hard, as if they go deep down underneath the skin. Occasionally I can 'release' fluid/puss from inside of them, but mostly I cannot and it does not look like they have a head on them. I have been on about 8 different courses of strong anitbiotics over the past 18 months and they do clear the lumps up, until 2 weeks later when they come back again. I've also been prescribed aqueous cream and betnovate cream but neither seem to be doing anything. I have also had huge abscesses and had to have them cut out & drained in hospital under local anaesthetic. Quite recently I have noticed that I have lots of purple/blue bruises appearing in between my legs, high up on my thighs, on my bottom cheeks and further inside, but near to my vagina and near the outer lips of the vagina. They appear in clusters like a rash. Sometimes they appear on their own, too. I also have noticed bruises appearing on my legs (my left shin is extremely swollen like there is fluid inside) and my limbs regularly hurt, like a pulsing pain, until I have to sit down it hurts so much. My shoulders hurt, particularly my left one. I am constantly tired and feel so weak and such pains in limbs and all over my body that sometimes I feel like I could just collapse. Other symptoms include feeling dizzy, constantly thirsty, blurred vision, problems remembering simple things or instructions, intense electric-shock like pains in my temples and lower back of head, severe vitamin b12 and folate deficiences for no reason. I take folic acid although it isn't being absorbed in my stomach for some reason. I have to be given vitamin b12 injections every 8 weeks to prevent anemia. I also have a rare blood disorder so my ferritin is extremely high (1000). Tests have ruled out diabetes. Could you please tell me if you think on any level that I have something to worry about. Or any conditions that you think I should be tested for. Thank you","Doctor":"Hi,Dear I went through your elucidative query.1-By the facts placed by your query and In my opinion, Cause of the painful vaginal lumps is -your infected groin and thighs,which is the cause for continued boils around your  vagina outer lips.2-Taking shower 2 times is not going to help you .3-In my opinion you need treatment of the groin-fungal infection with bacterial super-added infection -on priority.4-Simultaneously you had to take care of the hygine of the private parts by dilute-dettol sponging 3 times a day.5-Get your hb1ac done with fbs and pps and if any problem take treatment under control of the specialist physician.6.Your chronic vaginal painful lump is the  complication of the incorrect  therapy till now. 7-So as suggested here, plz take treatments, your  problem could be controlled in 8 wks time.3-I would advise-a-Good non-spicy veg bland diet,for 3 wks.b-Be on high protein bland diet with buttermilk with banana shakes for 3-4 wks time to tone up your disturbed-digestive system.-c-No antibiotics without doctors advise .avoid them as far as possible-d-and controll the infections in private parts, as suggested ,would resolve this issue.e-if need be I would advise a course of  Oflox-OZ for 7 days time to clear the skin infection of the groin with local betadine applcation and dettols sponging sos.4-Hope this would solve your query,5-Thanks for your query to the Health Care magic. 6-You are wellcome for any further treatments if required.7-I would love to help you out of YOur worry about your messed up groin infection and painful vaginal lumps.Thnks.Wellcome."},{"Patient":"Last night a lump or bump developed on each side of my head below the temples.

It is normal for the heart to beat fast after physical activity. As much as exercising is good, you should avoid over stretching the limit your body can go  If for example you usually run 400 meters, it is better to gradually ascend to 500 or 600 meters before getting to 800 meters this way you can avoid injury and exhaustion.

This has been the source of my (muscular) back pain for about 6 years now.  I have had someone try to consistently rub it out for several days at a time with no result.  It just causes irritation and the lump stays the same size.  I have read around and thought that it may be a cyst.  Is this possible in an upper back muscle?  Not sure if this has any bearing, but I do not have a hairy back.  If this is a cyst, would surgery be required to remove it?...and what type of doctor would I need to see? Thank you for any answers.","Doctor":"Hi.Read your history and an elucidate explanation about the lump you have underneath the shoulder blade. This is there for 6 years and by doing massage or so, you must have troubled it more. The most probable cause for such a mass may be fibrotic lump at the joining of muscles and as such a result of the chronic stress injury syndrome. I would advise you to see the Orthopedic or General Surgeon for proper diagnosis and take assistance of ultrasonography to know the exact content of it and get treatment accordingly.

If this is not a fascial hernia, the most probable diagnosis is a sebaceous cyst or a lipoma. Both are painless and non-tender to start with. Lipoma will be very freely mobile but the hernia or cyst will not be.Fascial hernia becomes prominent, fixed and taught if you contract the biceps.

I know I had scratched scabs there before due to dry skin I think and now there is a small line of openings In the skin. I thought maybe I scratched hard or something but was surprised at the color. I was already on the second day of Bactrim due to a UTI, so they said to take it for another day as I planned and prescribed a prescription ointment to apply 3 times a day. I have had a headache today ( possibly caffeine withdrawal) to help with the UTI. Headache is better tonight and area is more pale reddish brown and green. Swelling has gone down. I do feel a little warm but temp is only 99 degrees. Arm area may be slightly warm but hard to tell. I had cold shrimp for dinner a couple nights thawed from the frozen bag that said it was cooked.

The development of the swollen painful and colorful lump on the forehead could be due o the hematoma which resulted due to your itching hard the area. Since you are already under Bactrim cover, you do not need any other antibiotic or so; continue on the same. If your are taking this for UTI , should take Bactrim for at least 14 days. Frozen cooked shrimps do not cause any such problems, so do not worry about it.

You can mark the area of affection on the foot with a marker and take impression on the slipper. Cut that part with a cutter to accommodate the lump so that the pressure on it will be nil. Well as a Surgeon I would examine the lump, try to see the reason and then only decide whether to keep it or to excise it.Keeping some lumps can cause more complications later. I would also go for preliminary color doppler study of the foot to see whether the vascularity is compromised or not, a very important aspect in diabetes.

I panicked for a few minutes, then started to read about these things.I spent yesterday using ice packs off and on. Reduced a little; ibuprofen helps to keep burn/itch in check. Today (Tues.) no change. itched a little more when I woke up. I was supposed to travel to my50th class reunion on thurs. but am afraid that will be too much for it, since it hasn't not changed.

In my opinion, the lump you are feeling, is mostly due to hematoma due to injury in calf. Any soft tissue injury (muscle or tendon) cause healing by formation of hematoma. Hematoma is swelling around injured part made up of inflammatory cells and other tissue needed for healing. And it resolves slowly over 2-3 months. So your lump is more suggestive of resolving hematoma. But better to confirm this by clinical examination and ultrasound examination. So consult orthopedic doctor and get done 1. Clinical examination 2. Ultrasound examination of local part.

Fall causes soft tissue injury like muscle, skin or subcutaneous tissues.And healing in these tissues occur by hematoma formation. Hematoma is swelling consisting inflammatory cells and other tissue needed for healing. So possibility of hematoma is more in your case. It will resolve slowly over time. So better to get done ultrasound examination of local part for the diagnosis of hematoma. And if it is hematoma then it will slowly resolve by itself, hence no treatment is required."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...I am monitoring my bp from home.  I am currently getting two different readings.  First reading is 140/74. Second reading (2 minutes later) is 116/74.  I'm taking 5 mg of lisinopril daily.  My concern:  If my bp is really the second reading will taking the lisinoril cause my bp to drop too low?  NOTE:  My bp machine was checked for accuracy about a month ago.","Doctor":"Hello,Lisinopril does decreases bp, but this much fall within minutes is unlikely. Either of two readings is false. You should take the third reading in order confirm which is one is right. 5-10 mmhg variation is acceptable. Also, if you bent or tighten the arm or doing some activity with hand during may affect the readings. So this is fallacy of electronic apparatus, we need to take multiple readings.

In my opinion, you are mostly having allergic skin lesions due to chlorinated water exposure. Possibility of sun related skin changes are less. As sun exposure causes blackening of skin. Chlorine is very well known skin allergen. And it is used as disinfectant in swimming pool water. So susceptible individuals, on exposure to chlorinated water can develop allergic skin lesions.

Smoking etc When these muscles weaken, abdominal organs can protrude through the defect and appear as bulge. In initial stages this bulge is reducible.

It was bruised for sometime but the bruise soon went away. At the moment, I feel no pain but I have a small bump on the inside of my foot, where the bruise used to be, should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion, it is callus or malunion of fracture. You had foot injury 3 weeks ago. And after 3 weeks, you are having bump on trauma site. So possibility of fracture at the time of trauma and healing after 3 weeks is high. In bone fracture, healing occurs by callus formation. It is collection of inflammatory cells and calcium which give rise to appearance of swelling. Another possibility is malunion. If fractured fragments are not fused correctly then they can give rise to swelling due to malunion. So better to consult orthopedic doctor and get done clinical examination and x ray of affected foot."},{"Patient":"Hi there!  I had acl recontruction knee surery performed in Dec 2009.

I can understand your situation and problem. By your history and description, in my opinion you are having post operative joint abscess which is now coming out under skin. Following are the points which favours this diagnosis. 1. History of arthroscopic surgery and not improving after surgery 2. Enlarging swelling which is painful on touch. 3. Overlying skin point is whitish (pus point). So better to consult orthopedic doctor and get done 1. Clinical examination of knee joint 2. Ultrasound examination of local part 3. MRI of that knee joint. You may need revision surgery.

Yes, possibility of skin infection is more likely in his case. It is red, painful, enlarging and on exposed part of body, so possibility of bacterial infection is more in his case. He needs antibiotics, painkiller and anti inflammatory drugs. Since all these drugs are prescribed medicines, you need doctor 's prescription for them. He may need surgical dressing too.

Get done serum cholesterol level. If this is high then you need to start lipid lowering drugs like statin. And this can reduce fat accumulation on your back. But if your cholesterol levels are normal then liposuction is the only option. It is very safe surgery. It is usually done in day care setting. So no need to worry for this surgery. Success rate is 90% but in 10% cases recurrence is there. So discuss in detail about recurrence with your treating doctor."},{"Patient":"Hello.

The boil when active gives puss discharge and pain also. homeopathy helps to subside the pain and stop the pus. but gain after sometime this happens and agin i take homeopathy medicine. This doctor tells me that this is sinus or fistulla and it is not harmful. This will not be cured and will remain. I am 5ft 4 inches and 62 kgs. can anybody suggest what this is i am having?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. You are having chronic skin infection with discharging sinus. It is not seen commonly. But common in diabetic patients and patients with compromised immune system.

How can I treat this without a doctors visit?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. By your history and description, in my opinion, you are mostly having infected sebaceous cyst. Sebaceous cyst is common in hairy area. It is due to obstruction of the duct. So the sebum  accumulates in it and cause swelling. If you burst it, sebum will come out. Since the obstruction is there sebum will again fill up and cause recurrent swelling. Best treatment is surgical removal of sebaceous cyst.

I can understand your situation and problem. Following are the possible causes for your painless, stable upper arm lump. 1. Hemangioma 2. Lipoma 3. Dermoid (less likely) 4. Fibroid (less likely) Since your swelling is not causing you any trouble like not painful, not enlarging in size, non itchy, not restricting the movements etc, no treatment is required for it.

I can gently move the lump around in small circles. my right side is swollen. About 2 months ago i injured my sciatic nerve but there was no lumps in my back.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion, you should consult orthopedic doctor and get done 1.

Since you are having sciatic nerve injury in the past, following are the possible complications which can give rise to such swelling. 1. Menimgocele 2. Meningomyelocele 3. Neuroma of sciatic nerve All these needs surgical correction as all are enlarging in nature and can cause future complications if left untreated.

I can understand your situation and problem. Your all symptoms like weight gain, weakness, tiredness, hair trouble, skin issues, slow heart rate etc are suggestive of hypothyroidism. And lump can be due to either small colloid goiter or thyroid nodule. So better to consult doctor and get done 1. Ultrasound examination of neck 2. Thyroid function test (TSH, Free T3 and Free T4). You will mostly have hypothyroidism and treatment is daily thyroxine tablet according to thyroid function test report.

In my opinion, the swelling you are describing is mostly enlarged lymphnode. In children, infection is very common due to immature immunity. And upper respiratory tract infection(URTI)  is most common amongst all infection. This will cause enlargement of draining lymphnodes. And upper throat is drained by upper cervical lymphnodes. So URTI is more likely cause for his swelling (enlarged lymphnode). He was also having fever, this also supports the diagnosis of URTI. So treatment of URTI is required to reduce the swelling on back of head."},{"Patient":"I am a 38 year old mom of 3 boys.  I am aprox. 174 lbs and 5'4\\".  I have a family history of several types of cancer.  I found a small lump in my throat on the right side a few months ago.  Never thought about it because it didnt bother me.  I noticed it starting to get larger (about the size of a walnut now) and my lymph nodes on the right side of my neck starting from the center of my neck in front wrapping around to the center of the back of my neck.  also i have 2 small lumps in my groin area.  I went to my doctor this wednesday and she took an ekg which she said wasnt the same as last years and sent me immediately for a chest xray and ultrasound of my neck.  i also made an appointment with an ENT whom I saw today and did bloodwork yesterday.  The ENT checked my vocal chords and they were fine, but my right tonsil and adnoid are swollen and red.  He also noticed my swollen lymph nodes.  He suspects its just tonsilitis and put me on amoxicilian for 10 days, but had me schedule a ct scan and biopsy on my neck.  i called my primary doctor about an hour ago to get the results from my bloodwork.  The receptionist said the dr would be calling me soon and i should have family around.  I am concerned that this could be cancer.  i am a smoker...about a pack a day, have lost over 25 pounds since the last week of april, have very sweaty palms, slight fever and strange itchy skin.  i havent heard from my primary doctor yet...and its Friday.  Is this something I should be very concerned about?  Does this sound like cancer>","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion, possibility of lymphoma or leukemia is more in your case. Following points are in favour of lymphoma /leukemia. 1. Positive family history of cancer 2. Enlarge lymphnodes at multiple sites like neck and inguinal region. 3. Weight loss. 4. Sweating, weakness and fever. Another possibility is chronic granulomatous infection like tuberculosis.

I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you should consult doctor and get done clinical examination of these skin lesions. Following are the possible causes for your symptoms 1. External piles 2. Boils (skin infection) 3. Sebaceous cyst. Since your swellings are painless and bleed on touch, eternal piles are more likely cause. You need to avoid constipation, oily and spicy food. Drink plenty of fluids orally. Avoid moisture and keep proper hygiene of anal region. If still not improving in 10days then you should go for surgical correction to prevent bleeding and other Complications."},{"Patient":"I am 26 yrs old, I wiegh about 123 pounds and I am 5'3.

My right breast is now slightly larger then my left and sometimes my nipple hurts and itches. A heating pad will relieve the pain temporarily and then it comes back. Some days are easier to deal with then others. I did have a benign tumor when I was younger in 2001. It was removed along with two others they diddn't see on the sonagram. Is this just another episode of what I have experianced in the past or is this different? To touch my right breast is a little painful.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you should consult doctor and get done 1. Clinical examination of breast 2. Mammography of breast. Possibility of recurrence of fibroadenoma is more. But since you are having pain and slight color change of overlying skin, possibility of breast abscess (bacterial infection) or early breast malignancy should also be  evaluated.

Could the mirena be causing the higher prolactin??","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. No mirena is not causing higher prolactin level. In my opinion your endometriosis is causing higher prolactin levels. Another possibility is prolactin secreting tumour.

Once endometriosis and prolactin levels are controlled, all your symptoms will go away. Don't worry, you will be alright."},{"Patient":"Thanks. Three weeks ago I fell on my bike. This resulted in several bruises which have mostly dissipated. A large lump is still present on my lower right leg however, on the calf. Would this be a hematoma? I am a 58 year old male.

But better to get done 1. Clinical examination by orthopedic doctor 2.  X ray of affected part 3. Ultrasound examination of affected part These all are needed to rule out fracture and callus formation. At your age of 58 years, osteoporosis is inevitable.

Recently I had acid reflux in the night and felt the rate was high. It wasn't until after exercise that I realized it was around 155 and apparently had been at that rate for about 7 hours","Doctor":"Hello,Acid reflux or exercise can increase increase heart rate slightly, but 155 persisting for 7 hours is less likely. This can be a cardiac arrhythmia like psvt or atrial fibrillation, in which heart rate suddenly goes up. Blood pressure may fall during these episodes and one has dizziness, fainting, blackouts, sometimes syncope. Usually ecg is normal as it is usually done in between the episodes. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You will need 24 hour holter monitoring or get ecg done during high heart rate. Also, hemoglobin and thyroid test should be done. ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard. Is there any stress or anxiety associated.    Till the time your evaluation is complete, you can ask your local doctor for tab ciplar LA 20 mg once a day.     If none of the above is successful then last option is of electrophysiological studies which is invasive test which can diagnose and treat the arrhythmia permanently in most of the cases.

By your history and description, it seems that you are intravenous drug abuser. Your technique is proper and with due aseptic precautions. But repeated injections cause local site inflammatory changes and thinning of vein.

It feels similar to the painful lumps I got in both nipples during puberty.  But I'm 34 now and haven't had those lumps in a long time. I know what most likely caused this sore lump though,  I rub them almost every night, sometimes for 2-4 hours at a time because it is very pleasurable in a sexual way.  I have been doing this for over a year, but have only developed this painful lump in the past 2 months. It came on gradually, but seems to shrink a little when I don't rub it for a day or two.  And when I do rub it, it seems to soften up after a few minutes and seem less painful.  But, in the morning the lump hard again and is more swollen and painful, What is going on?  I only rub them lightly over my shirt and don't ever chaffe my nipples.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you should consult dermatologist and get done clinical examination to rule out infection. Skin infection is common if frequent rubbing is done. Another and more likely possibility is hormone induced changes in nipples and areola. Rubbing causes sexual excitement by producing oxytocin. This oxytocin is responsible for enlargement of nipples and areola during sexual excitement. It also causes dilatation of lactifarous glands and ducts and this can cause swelling under nipples. Oxytocin also enlarges montegomary glands. So all these can cause swelling under nipples while Rubbing. But better to rule out infection first."},{"Patient":"I have a mushy type polyp on the anus.

From your history, it seems that you have got a bursa (fluid filled cyst) over the area which might occur especially those who put chronic pressure on their knees . For a diagnosis, if I were your doctor, I would advise you to get a FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) to have a cytological diagnosis and further management depending on the report.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I m really scared of having a stroke, and my question is: Can you have a stroke with normal blood pressure? The second question is: Can the docs see a blood clot or anything irregularity with the brain and their vessels with a CT Scan with out contrast? Went to the ER with tingling in my head and burning in my thigh, and the doc said that the CT Scan came out normal. It still has me worried that I might have a clot, my blood pressure was normal a 120 over 70.","Doctor":"Hi, Yes, there are instances when one can have a stroke with normal blood pressure like in patients who are normotensive with heartbeat irregularities (like Atrial Fibrillation), as well those with blood vessel abnormalities like amyloid angiopathy. CT scan of the brain may show signs of either bleeding or infarction, but there are instances when it may be normal especially when done very early in those with infarcts (caused by clots) which may be more evident when done in a few more hours. But the importance of doing an early CT scan is to rule out hemorrhage in those who present clinically with stroke. I would suggest that a consult be done if your symptoms are persistent for further work-up and appropriate treatment. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I also have pain on my left eye (not the lid but the bottom) when it is touched or blinking excessively. My throat is somewhat sore, more so on the left side, however it isn t exactly a sore throat as one you have when you have a cold. Could it be sinuses or do I need to see a doctor?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query.Seeing a Doctor, preferably an ENT Specialist is always a better idea, as he is the only one who can do a clinical evaluation, ENT Endoscopy and other relevant investigations like FNAC, and get the proper treatment done. The commonest cause of non-tender swelling behind the ear is a lymph node. The pain in the lower eyelid can be a cyst or so. sore throat can be due to a local infection and all the things may not be related as per your history, but the treatment remains almost same for all.

She is taking Thyronorm 100mcg once daily. Now her TSH is almost at the lower level (0.98) but T4 is very high (21.0). T3 is within normal range. Since she has started treatment on hypothyrodism, her T4 is always on the higher side - 14, 15 and now 21. Once doctor suggested her to lower the dosage of Thyronorm to 75mcg, but doing this increased the TSH. She feels fatigued and has lost lot of weight in last 5 years. She has developed a minor lump also on her throat recently.","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query. Read and understood the history of Hypothyroidism and taking Thyronorm for the last 6 years by  your mother. Thyronorm is a replacement hormone T3 and T4 are produced by the thyroid glans.But the TSH is produced by Pituitary gland and it produces it in response to the feedback from the circulating thyroid hormones sensed by it. Hence are the change. When the pituitary feels that the body's levels of thyroid hormone is reduced, it will produce more to give an order to the thyroid gland to produce more. Hence it is more important to know and keep the levels of the thyroid hormones under normal range. You have to reduce the dose of Thyronorm, as it is more dangerous to keep the T4 levels in the high range, it will affect the whole body."},{"Patient":"I've had a lump on the side of my leg for some time now, I went to see the doctor about it, and was told its just a skin growth thing, no harm.

You should take antibiotics and painkillers for the same.

Usually after 10 days the swelling becomes soft and liquifies as hematoma resolves but if it is hard as bone, then it may be getting calcified. Get X-ray skull done to look for calcification.

Before even when it grew you couldn't really see it clearly, just feel it.","Doctor":"It may be a lymph node which grows with some local infection like cough and cold and subsides as the infection goes off. You need to have a broad spectrum antibiotic for 7-10 days to reduce it. Usually, a sebaceous cyst may also present the same ways but it usually has a black punctum or dot some where on the bulge.

For the diagnosis, you need to do ECG at the time of palpitation & tachycardia.

Lately, I have noticed a bump on my back around my mid-shoulder blade. It's not red, itchy, or inflamed. If I squeeze the area a continuous line of thick white stuff (not smelly) comes out. I keep squeezing and squeezing and it keeps coming and coming. I generally relieve this area until the bump is no longer noticeable but then It fills up over time (months I would say) and the same process begins. Any explanations and should I worry?","Doctor":"Its is a sebaceous cyst. Usually in people with oily skin sebum forming glands in the skin produces lots of sebum which sometimes gets trapped and forms a sebaceous cyst. It is just below the skin and contains white to greyish cheese material. Treatment is excision of the cyst. Next time, don't squeeze it. Let it become prominent and once it is prominent, go to a general surgeon who will excise it completely. Its easier for a surgeon to take out the cyst when it is prominent, so that whole of the cyst is removed because if any remnant is left back, it will recur."},{"Patient":"I have 3 bump on my head. I have 1 which is of a pea size from quite a long time but doesn't hurt. I have got 2 more which are smaller in size but they too don't pain.

The other was a physician who said it is just a normal thing. She hold them and tried to move back and forth to check if they are attached to the skull. She said that they are not connected to skull and free from skull. Thats a growth under the skin of the head and thus nothing to worry about. The only solution to it is to get it operated and removed. However, as per her, it is not required. Then, the third doctor is a homeopathic doctor who said that it is a calcium deposit and can be treated by homeopathic medicines. I am actually little worried and want to know another opinion. My one lump has grown lil bit more but doesn't pain. Do you suggest me any kind of test to confirm the reason?","Doctor":"These may be just a sebaceous cyst which form due to blockage of the sebaceous glands present in the skin which leads to slow accumulation of sebum inside the glands and increase in its size gradually over months to years. Its better to get them excised because they are prone to infection. Once infected, you will have to get first the incision and drainage along with antibiotics and then later removal of the cyst. So, its better that you get rid of them before infection sets in. There is management of sebaceous cyst by medicines. Surgery and excision is the only way."},{"Patient":"Hi,  I feel a round fat like structure in there inside my cheek which is not visible and is present just near the joint of my jaw, below my ear.

The bumps don t itch, but they seem to be coming from the inside of my arm instead of the surface.","Doctor":"Usually blood drawn from any site does not cause any problem until unless you have a bleeding disorder. If you don't have any history of prolonged bleeding in the past, the bump and pain may be due to some other reason and drawing of the blood may be just an incidental association. It may be a neurofibroma or a lipoma.  In case it is a hematoma which was there at the time of blood drawn, that may be just calcified but it will not progress.

Sometimes, forehead bruise may be big in children due to rupture of small blood vessels and sometimes, you may even see redness in the eyes which is due to trickling of the blood into the sclera. Just some pain killers have to be given. Gradually, it will become bluish black and soft and subside. It may sometime take 10-15 days to resolve fully.

Still for your mental peace you should go for fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy once.  Don't worry about that. Just be relaxed.

I have a red pimple like sore on the back of my upper right arm and shoulder area.  It has been there for about 3 months.  My dr. thought that I had shingles around that time, and treated me for that.  I had another sore that he saw near my bra line.  I was also experiencing pain allover my body.  He thought for sure it was shingles. This other sore just hasn't gone away.  When I try to pop it or open it, only blood comes out.  It is a circular sore on the inside. After agravating it, it gets really sore and dark.  I also have been experiencing tingling pain in my back and down my left side, some days better than others.  I occasionally get chills and pins and needles feelings in the back of my head and throughout my body.  I also have this sharp pain in my upepr left abdomen area, and sometimes i can push my stomach out and it gurgles.  Very weird.  The pain i get in my stomach is like a quick sting, and it occurs to my left side and then around my backside.    I also just had had baby in January.  I have had MRI of brain, Chest xray, thorasic spine xray, CT scan of neck, routine bloodwork, bloodwork for Lupus, Endoscopy, HIDA scan, and ultrasounds of my liver, pancreas, kidneys, as well as my thyroid levels checked.

Were you down with fever since that could elevate the heart as i have mentioned.Fever can also cause the appearance of protein in the urine, which would disappear once the fever settles.In my opinion fever seems to be the most probable cause for you having both a fast heart rate and protein in the urine.Please do not get worked up.

Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. The immediate swelling could have been due to a hematoma (collection of blood) , but the later development of hard lump within a short duration would prompt me to go for a plain x ray of the knee to rule out any fracture, specially if you had pain or limitation of movement. Further management would depend on the reports and a clinical examination of your knee with other special investigations if need be. Till then, I would advise you not to strain your knee much and would prescribe you with an anti inflammatory and a proton pump inhibitor drug for a symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Although it requires a physical examination of the lump to opine on it, I suppose this could be a hematoma (collection of blood) post operatively.

Eat healthy and drink plenty of fluids.It's advisable to see your doctor if you experience frequent symptoms of orthostatic hypotension because they sometimes can point to more-serious problems.

I want to tell you If he got an air  behind his heart but he is feeling well then it need not be worried about this . Anywhen who is being exposed to vein or arteries can develop this air pocket . In his case he was shot in the neck , so either it will be because of bullet or due to artery/vein exposure in ED/ICU. If it troubles him in any means then the treatment for air embolism is recompression in a hyperbaric chamber. This is a painless treatment during which a person  occupy a steel, high-pressurized room that delivers 100 percent oxygen. This therapy can cause an air embolism to shrink, so it can be absorbed into his bloodstream without causing any damage.Good Luck"},{"Patient":"My 8 year old daughter has a lump above her canine on top left gum.

Complex partial seizures (or temporal lobe epilepsy seizures) can mimic all this clinical scenario. Gastritis or gastro-esophageal reflux can not be excluded either.

Coming to this point, I would recommend consulting with your attending physician for some tests: - a chest X ray study- an EEG- a resting ECG- carbamazepine (tegretol) plasma levels- complete blood count- PCR, ESR for inflammation. If all these tests result normal, I would recommend trying an antiacid. If it helps relieve your symptoms, a fibrogastroscopy would be necessary.

No - the large bump on your lower neck might not be due to a bulging disc and could be an independent entity, possibly benign which could be known by a clinical examination and other investigations like an FNAC  if indicated. The pain in  your neck could be due to other problems related to the spine like a cervical spondylitis which is more common especially if your job involves staring at computers for long hours without any break. If I were your doctor, I would advise you to continue physiotherapy from a qualified physiotherapist along with use of a cervical collar, go for a short course of anti inflammatory along with a proton pump inhibitor for a symptomatic relief.

The compression and shearing force applied by the seat-belt must have caused the bruise on the abdominal wall.The abdominal wall has lot of fat and potential space for the bleeding to occur in pockets of loose tissues. These take time to get absorbed by the body and hence appear as multiple hematoma. They are painful on touch if under pressure.Do not worry if there are no signs of acute inflammation like redness, throbbing pain. These will reabsorbed by the body gradually. You may take an anti-inflammatory medicine like Ibuprofen if it suits you. Do not fondle with it, use loose clothes, consult a Doctor if there are changes as I explained like increase in redness, pain or size."},{"Patient":"I have this hard lump under the skin on my chin it s colorless and painless. and can t really see it until I m in the sun.
