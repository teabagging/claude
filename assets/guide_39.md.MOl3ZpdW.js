Piles occurs due to constipation. You donot need  surgey for it till it is very severe, which could manifest in the form of severe bleeding on going to toilet. So your constipation needs to be addressed for your piles to be under control. It can be done by drinking lots of water and eating fruits and vegetables particularly leafy vegetables like spinach. Also have regularity in your bowel habits, that is try to go to toilet during morning after you wake up. Maintain healthy food habits like avoiding alcohol, spicy foods, moderation in red meat, which is the cause for your stomach upset. Hope I have answered your query. I will be available for your follow up queries if any. Wishing you good health. Regards,"},{"Patient":"I am 28 years old and recently consulted a dermat for acne marks on my face.

Does it have any side effect","Doctor":"Hi!Richa, Welcome To HealthcareMagic forum, Before telling you details about pimples ,let me tell you first about chemical peel.Its a very safe procedure if done by a dermatologist and it can be done even if you have pimples .It works both for pimples and dark spots.The best peel would be salicylic acid peel . Now, pimples are multifactorial ,and therefore one has to find the exact cause of it. It can be because of wrong use of soaps to moisturizers or any fairness creams which one is using , to hormonal disturbances if anybody has(esp in females).So,a complete work up is necessary in all patients.Also one should remember that its not a short course treatment,but a matter of say 6 months or so if pimples are sever . Firstly I would advise you to stop all cosmetic creams if you are using on face. Also look for other features of hormonal imbalance in body like weight gain,irregular periods,facial hair  & scalp hair loss.If you have any of these then get a hormonal profile done.In such cases conventional treatment(antibiotics) for acne would not work,and one needs hormonal tablets to cure acne. In case you don't have any hormonal imbalance & you don't respond to conventional treatment, then one can take retinoids .Retinoids is a wonderful medicine for acne ,provided one gets all the relevant investigations and takes care of all the precautions associated with it.Along with chemical peel ,this would give you a flawless skin. I advise you to consult a dermatologist and take proper treatment . After few days my web site would be launched (www.skinhairclinic.com),you can get details and pictures about pimples and their treatment.

Cause of acne may be just a wrong selection of soap or a moisturizer to hormonal disturbances in body (esp in females). Treatment starts form the use of a anti acne face cleanser .It can be a anti acne soap or a face wash .Next would be use of a good anti acne cream for day time and night time use. Along with this one should be given a course of antibiotic tablet . If patient does not respond to this or one has very sever acne then comes use of oral retinoids.Retinoids are wonder drug for acne , but one needs to undergo various blood investigations before taking this .Also there are certain precautions which one needs to follow before use of this medicine.Your dermatologist would be the best judge for this . Along with this one has to drink plenty of water and take good 7 hr sleep in night.Healthy life style with above treatment is a must to keep your face clean and acne free. So,i would advise you to consult a skin specialist(dermatologist) who can prescribe you medicines accordingly. Please do not believe in over the counter medicines as they don't have any good result on acne. regards, Dr.chawda"},{"Patient":"I had pimples in my face , i used to remove them using my nails,, now these removed pimples looks like holes in my face, is there any solutions to get rid of these hole/patch","Doctor":"Dont try to remove pimples by nails.It will aggaravate your problem.

Hi, I am 19 yrs old female and I have been suffering with some type of skin rash, acne , blothyness. Im really unsure of what it is. Everytime i try to change my diet and the way i eat, this happens to me. Started occuring from 2008. Unfortunately i am a yo-yo dieting type and like to try out new diets. Everytime i change the way i eat, 4-5 days or a week in it appears on my chest. I feel a tingly itchy sensation in the center of my chest between my breasts... than i know its coming. The only way i know how to counteract it is immediately stopping my diet and workout regimen and going back to being sedentary and eating whatever i want. The first time dealing with this I wanted to lose weight for an upcoming wedding so i didnt let it stand in the way. This left my face badly scarred all over. I continued on and I continued to break out on my chest, face (chin, and T-zone. The blothcy skin goes from blothchy under the skin and slowing rises to the surface, after a few days becomes raised-ish bumps very slightly and spread to the inside parts of my breasts. Later they form into white-head type pimples . My face itches and feels allergic almost and dry with blothchyness 2 days before the actual white heads begin to form. On my chin and between my eyebrows the whiteheads form 3 or 4 at a time and if i dont pop them they all form into one big one.

We recommend that you get yourself examined by an ENT surgeon to rule out Sinusitis and to use anti-histamines as prescribed by him/her. Steam Inhalation with Sinarest caps or a few drops of Menthol oil helps to an extent. You should avoid dust, cold weather, pets. Try to wear a mask when you are in the vicinity of dust or traffic. Take more citrus fruits and amla as they are rich in Vitamin C. Alternatively you can take Tab. Limcee 1 tab per day. Night fall is a natural phenomenon. It does not cause any disease or illness. It is commonly occurs in every male. Pimples are common in your age and will subside by themselves. The pimples and night fall are not related. If the problem of pimple is severe than apply Benzoyl peroxide 2.5% solution twice a day after washing your face. Dont go in sun after its application.

Well I am aware that many women pay large sums for this type of swelling, it is beginning to concern me.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. The description of the condition presents allergy like reaction. However, its persistence might be due to your regular exposure to the allergen that is not known to you yet. I would suggest you to go for a blood test for allergy. The test will analyze what are the substances that you are allergic to so that you can avoid exposure in future or if the exposure is unavoidable, you can continue taking antihistamine. After the test, you can start antihistamine such as Levocetrizine 5 mg (Levocet) or Loratidine 10 mg (Lorfast) once a day. If the medicines fail to reduce the swelling, you should see a dentist or dermatologist for the clinical examination of the lips and further investigations.I hope this information helps you.

You can track your ovulation by repeated ultrasound and when your follicles is more than 17 to 18 mm, you can take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.

Thank you for writing to us at healthcaremagicBenzoate based products can cause contact sensitivity and possibly it has lead to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation/ PIH.A common example of benzoate based products is PABA or para amino benzoate which used to be a common sunscreen agent in the past but now has been replaced with other safer ingredients.I suggest you to use a broad spectrum sunscreen, covering both UV A as well as UV B part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The sunscreen should be PABA free.Use it throughout the day.

Thanks for writing to us at healthacremagicThe higher the SPF of a sunscreen, the oilier it gets.The whitish texture is due to the fact that this sunscreen contains Zinc Oxide which is a physical sunscreen ingredient and appears white because it is opaque, unlike chemical sunscreen ingredients which are transparent.You may try a sunscreen with a lower SPF 30. The protection provided by a sunscreen with SPF30 would be at par with the protection provided by a sunscreen with higher SPF (i.e SPF 50).Alternatively you may try a different cosmetically acceptable brand of sunscreen. You may find it either OTC Or you may also ask for a prescription from your dermatologist.

Microdermabrasion is a procedure that removes the superficial layers of skin and it is done with a help of machine.

Chemical peeling is again a similar procedure where superficial layers of skin is removed but here the effect is more profound and it stimulates new skin generation in much better way thus giving you more youthful and radiant skin.Several options are available in chemical peels like glycolic acid, salicylic acid, TCA but my personal favorite is retinol peel or also known as Yellow peel.The rationale of combining these procedure is to get better and long lasting effects.I am sure 6-8 sessions will bring out a pretty gratifying results.At home the results can be maintained with antioxidant tablets like Antoxid HC once daily in morning (It can be safely taken for months together) and night application of cream containing mixture of glycolic acid , arbutin and Kojic acid. In morning you can apply a good quality sunscreen with additional skin lightening ingredients (NILTAN SPF).Use a good quality facewash like Fash facewash gel.Take plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet and indulge into regular exercise for healthy skin and body.Hope this was useful.Let me know if I can be of any more assistance.Thank you and take care,Dr Hardik PitrodaM.D Dermatology"},{"Patient":"is letsi tab helps in concieving baby soon.i want to get pregnant soon dr prescribe me letsi2.5mg tab.        my age is 25yrs, wt-51kg,i had d n c on oct 15 now i am trying to concieve my reports are normal.after intercourse sperm comes out from me is it means i am not concieving.plz help me","Doctor":"Hi, I think it is normal for the semen to come out of vagina after contact.

Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicOily face is due to overactive sebaceous glands.While cleansing is an important step in those who have oily face, it should be gentle and not harsh; it should not over dry skin because that will in turn cause sebaceous glands to produce more oil and therefore rebound oiliness, shortly after washing.I usually ask my patients to use either a salicylic acid based cleanser Or take a few sessions of salicylic acid peel. Salicylic acid inhibits oil production and deep cleanses pores.Another alternative is to start patients on a low dose of Oral Retinoids e.g Isotretinoin.

Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicHair removing creams can be irritant to the sensitive skin of the genitals.The general recommendation for using a hair removal cream is to keep them for just 4-5 minutes before rinsing them off. The contact time never to be exceeded beyond 10 minutes.The ingredients in hair removing creams dissolve hair keratin, thereby weakens it and causes it to break off.Since epidermis is also rich in keratin therefore leaving it in contact with sensitive genital skin for too long can cause skin damage and irritation.Since you rinsed it off with water in about 4-5 minutes, therefore, it is unlikely that it would have caused any such harmful reaction during this short contact period.In my patients who present with irritant reactions to hair removing product, I usually ask them to use you a moderately potent topical steroid e.g fluticasone propionate 0.05%cream, twice daily.Regards"},{"Patient":"HI! i have a question about a sun block.

I've been using sun bloc because i want to be fully protected from the sun and its damaging effect. Can this 50+ sun block cause premature wrinkling?","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicContrary to what you believe, a broad spectrum sunscreen is rather protective against sun induced damage (photoageing) and delays the onset of fine lines and wrinkles.Photoageing is characterized by gradually diminishing collagen and elastin from the dermis due to the effect of the UV A induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) which damage dermal collagen and elastin.UV A part of the electromagnetic spectrum is mainly responsible for photoageing.A broad spectrum sunscreen (spf 30 and more) filters both UV B as well as UV A part of the electromagnetic spectrum and is therefore protective. Therefore, you may continue with the sunscreen for its protective effects against photoageing.To be effective a sunscreen should be applied every 2-3 hours and in adequate amounts on the sun-exposed skin, specially when moving outdoors.

More importantly the fact is no topical medications are going to help in removing scars.

Botox for forehead creases, frown lines, and smile lines. Sometimes Brow lift, which takes care of sagging brows, can take care of these things more permanently.

Can I bleach the hair for now or get it threaded before going for treatment?","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for contacting us on healthcaremagicLaser hair reduction (LHR) is a very safe and reliable way for hair reduction. Apart from mild redness after the sitting which usually resolves in 1-2 hours, and by ice application, there are really no side effects at all if done by a well trained/experienced expert.Normally 6-8 sittings will give you a good hair reduction. The hair will become finer, the density will be greatly reduced.It is the FDA approved for hair reduction and gives long lasting results.Since you are planning to get LHR therefore, bleaching is not advisable. That is because melanin is the target chromophore for Laser used in hair removal and hence if you bleach the hair melanin which you would have already bleached out would not be there in the hair to absorb laser energy and hence hair would not be effectively removed. Threading, waxing etc is also not advisable while you are taking Laser hair reduction.Shaving is the only permissible method of hair removal while on laser.Regards"},{"Patient":"hi.i m 23yrs old.my face skin is not even.it is dark from forehead & upper lips.my friend told me to use tenovate gn at night regularly.can i use the cream.is there any side effect of it?and my next question is my lips are also dark.also suggest me about my lips. thank you.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern for uneven skin tone over face and forehead.I am happy to know that your friend is so concerned about you but the only problem is that he is not a dermatologist to guide you best.Tenovate is strong potency steroid cream which is never to be used on face.

Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicTanning seems to be your main concern. UV A part of the electromagnetic spectrum is mainly responsible for tanning.Asian skin tans fairly easily because it contains a lot of melanin.Candid-B lotion contains antifungals as the active ingredients. It would be irrational to use it on face for fairness. I would say you should not use it on face. It also contains a steroid as one of its ingredients, which may do more harm than good.Rather, I would suggest you to use a broad spectrum sunscreen, that which offers both UVB as well as UV A protection throughout the day. A broad spectrum sunscreen should have a minimum spf of 30 + or more.If you were one of my patients I would have suggested you a skin lightening cream e.g containing one or more of the following ingredients like kojic acid, glycolic acid, arbutin etc. There are various creams that contain these active ingredients and are available on prescription.Therefore, I would suggest that you seek an appointment with a dermatologist in your region.

I am suffering due to pimple from last 6 months & left some spot on face also I go to gym from last 2 months & drink protein shake. is this the reason of pimple? can you please suggest me sucessful treatment or Doctor for same ?","Doctor":"Hello,Pimple does erupt between the age of thirteen to twenty-five years, and in some cases up to thirty years. In male patients, the best mode of treatment is by Vitamin A ester. It is basically by Isotretinoin in proper dose for long term period under strict dermatological supervision.Protein shakes itself don't cause any pimples but if these contain any anabolic steroid preparation then can cause the same. For the marks in my patients, I prefer to apply kojic acid cream preparation.Hope I have answered your query.

Because every dress nt sute to my body and i hate my self with this feel. There are so many product in market for it but i m scare of all because of there side effects please suggest me a good one product or remidies which hasnt side effects","Doctor":"Hi,Sorry to hear about your problem. But, you are not alone. Many women have small breasts and they feel stressed about it. After about 19-20 years the only way breasts would become larger naturally is during lactation.All the creams and gels and tablets available on the net are not proven effective and have their own side effects and of course the costs involved.The only time tested and proven method to increase breast size is by surgery. Most commonly you can use a silicone implant. We can also use your own fat if you have enough, to inject into the breasts.All these options can be discussed with your local plastic surgeon. The surgery of breast augmentation using silicon implants is pretty straightforward and gives lasting results.All the best Dr.Surindherwww.cosmesisindia.com"},{"Patient":"I am a 39 year old mother of two aged 5 and 15 years. I have a receding chin which was a major cause of concern for me affecting my confidence level. However, now I'm  planning to go for a genioplasty augmentation in two months time. What I would like to know is that at my age will the healing be much slower ?? Will I ever get back my lost sensation ? Please help since my family is against me going for it now. Please also let me know what are the other risks involved in sliding genioplasty at my age. Thankyou.","Doctor":"Hi,If you are otherwise healthy, then there should not be any issues with bone healing even at 39. The sliding genioplasty will be fixed with plates and screws to help keep it in place till the healing occurs.Another simpler option if you are only looking at cosmetic augmentation is to go with a Chin augmentation using implants. This would be a simpler option in the sense that there is no bone cutting involved. You can meet your local plastic surgeon to learn more about it.All the best for your procedure.Dr.Surindherwww.cosmesisindia.com"},{"Patient":"hello sir, I am 24 yrs old male. today at around 5 pm, I had an unprotected intercourse with my girlfriend (age-22,average health, no serious aliments). within 2 hours, she took a emergency contraceptic pill.

I don t remember it being this shape when I was younger. What can I do to change this besides cosmetic surgery? Do you think it s a medical issue?","Doctor":"hi..there are different ways to improve buttocks shape..but unfortunatly except exercise there is no other way to do this..there are surgical and non-surgical alternatives to give fuller, more rounded buttocks:Exercises like squats will build the gluteus muscle and tone the buttocks.Surgical butt enhancement treatments include fat transfer, butt implants, and the Brazilian Butt Lift treatment.Implants have the advantage of adding permanent volume to the buttocks, but has higher risks for infection, seromas and malpositioning.The fat transfer procedures (including Brazilian Butt Lift) is less invasive than implant augmentation, and the required liposculpture helps contour the gluteal area. A disadvantage is that the amount of volume that remains after a year varies from person to person.hope you got your answer,,,thanksDR IHSAN"},{"Patient":"hello doctor i am 22 year old and 87 kgs.my height is 5\\"5'.i want to do liposuction in abdomen,thigh,and arms.is there any side effect.will the skin burn after liposuction as it is done by ray?will the reduced fat regenerate?will the skin where liposuction is done swell? will wrinkles can be appeard on the skin after liposuction?","Doctor":"HI...thanks for sharing your problem here in this forum..your BMI is 31+liposuction is a procedure by which body fat is removed by suction assisted procedure,,this will reduce your fat deposit already in the body..its does not reduce regeneration of fat rather sometime it is accelerated.sometime skin overlying get bruised but its  recovered..skin loss can occur very rarely..wrinkling of the overlying skin can occur..other complications includes infections,contour irregularity etc..but still you can go for it as these complication don't occur frequently... if any issue feel free to ask again..thanksDR IHSAN"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

Oral drugs along with topical applications might improve the lesions.You consult dermatologist.I advise in my patients having acne as below..- to avoid all suspected factors which stimulate or exacerbate the lesions- tab azithromycine 500 mg thrice a week 24 hourly consecutively for few monthsOr cap minocycline 50 mg daily in the morning.- tab isotretinoin 5 mg in low dose daily at night- clindamycine gel, benzoyl peroxide or adapalene gel to apply at night on lesions only-cleanse the face with antiseptic face wash like acmed or acwash face washAfter total cure, scar therapy may be done by expert cosmetologists. It may derma roller,dermabrasion,chemical peeling or laser therapy. According to the conviniencies, any mode of treatment may be cosidered.Have patience as the good result may be there after few months. And relapse may be prevented. Be positive and remain happy for the good result.I hope you got my answer.

Currently I am using Ranbaxy Yugard along with Eukroma as a night cream as per my doctor s advice for getting fair complexion. He had also suggested me Ekran Aqua gel as the sunscreen. Now, I want to get a better sunscreen since I am facing Sweating of my skin . I was going through some research in the web and I find that Lotus Sun 3 in 1 matte look SPF 40 is recomended by a lot. But I want a medicated Sunscreen which will not only give UVA, UVB protection but also make my skin glow and lighter. Can you please suggest me any better option at less price.

I used to be very fair when i ws young, but after the age of 5, i started getting tan and my complexion is very dull now , is there any way to get my complexion back as in a fairness treatment ??","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for posting on HCM.Generally, in my patients of sun tanning I would advise then to get series of microdermabrasion followed by chemical peeling. Microdermabrasion is a procedure that removes the superficial layers of skin and it is done with a help of machine. Then after a week or same day itself I would carry out another procedure called chemical peeling. Chemical peeling is again a similar procedure where superficial layers of skin is removed but here the effect is more profound and it stimulates new skin generation in much better way thus giving you more youthful and radiant skin.Several options are available in chemical peels like glycolic acid, salicylic acid, TCA but my personal favorite is retinol peel or also known as Yellow peel.The rationale of combining these procedure is to get better and long lasting effects.I am sure 6-8 sessions will bring out a pretty gratifying results.At home the results can be maintained with antioxidant tablets like Antoxid HC once daily in morning (It can be safely taken for months together) and night application of cream containing mixture of glycolic acid , arbutin and Kojic acid. In morning you can apply a good quality sunscreen with additional skin lightening ingredients (NILTAN SPF).Use a good quality facewash like Fash facewash gel.Take plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet and indulge into regular exercise for healthy skin and body.Hope this was useful.Let me know if I can be of any more assistance.Thank you and take care,Dr Hardik PitrodaM.D Dermatology"},{"Patient":"Recently pimples are appearing especially on my forehead between the eyebrows........one of the skin specialist has preferred me clinmiskin gel, acneoff soap and doxts-s tablets.

Let me start on a positive note , if you have had one pregnancy then you will have a second for sure. 100% sure.You have proved your capability !!!Kindly see if the following checklist of investigations is doneHusband- Semen analysis at least 2-  done 4 weeks apart preferably in an infertility center ( examination done by andrologist), Blood sugarsWife - Blood Sugars, Thyroid profile Ultrasound scans to evaluate Uterus , Ovaries & adnexa          Confirm tubal patency- most important- Tube is the connection           between uterus & ovaries( the bridge where sperm meets the egg &           forms a baby) this is size of hair follicle & cannot be seen on scans.           Being such a small opening tube can get blocked easily,            So check with HSG( Xray with dye), or SSG ( Scan with dye) or            LaparoscopyIf all this done & found normal , nothing can stop a pregnancy with God's willWith that history of tubal pregnancy, I would suggest tubal testing before anything ,I bet there is some problem in the tube. If unfortunately both tubes have problem IVF is the only option. Even if both tubes are open & you don't get pregnant after 3-4 months, think of IVF , as if tube is possibly damaged leading to ectopic pregnancy. Tube may be physically open , but not functionally- the ciliary process inside tube needed to push egg , sperm & embryo may be damaged !!

Chemical peeling is again a similar procedure where superficial layers of skin is removed but here the effect is more profound and it stimulates new skin generation in much better way thus giving you more youthful and radiant skin.Several options are available in chemical peels like glycolic acid, salicylic acid, TCA but my personal favorite is retinol peel or also known as Yellow peel.The rationale of combining these procedure is to get better and long lasting effects.I am sure 6-8 sessions will bring out a pretty gratifying results.At home the results can be maintained with antioxidant tablets like Antoxid HC once daily in morning (It can be safely taken for months together) and night application of cream containing mixture of glycolic acid , arbutin and Kojic acid.

Thus there is nothing to worry about the darkening.Stretch marks also known as striae are often the result of the rapid stretching of the skin associated with rapid growth or rapid weight changes. Stretch marks is also be influenced by hormonal changes and in your case is due to pregnancy.Stretch marks are notorious to treat and results of the treatment is highly variable.For now I would advise minimal treatment in form of application of vitamin E rich oil twice a day.Later on after pregnancy you can go for extensive treatment like tretinoin 0.1% gel (NEXRET 0.1%)at bedtime and glycolic acid 12% (GLYCO-A ) cream in evening.Also, cosmetic procedures like Yellow peel/Chemical peeling, microdermabrasion, laser therapy, Mesotherapy can be tried for augmented results.Hope this will take care of your query.Thank youDr Hardik Pitroda"},{"Patient":"hi my name is neha as i am applying brite on my hand and legs for past 15 days as my hand and leg have dark complexion should continue to apply brite as i find no adverse effect or recomment me good cream for my hand and leg so that it can become fair is brite for fairness????","Doctor":"Hello Neha, Thank you for posting on HCM.Complexion of any person is has two two components; constitutive, one which is predetermined by genetics and racial factors and usually cannot be changed with any treatment.

It is a prescription product. Dermatologist's commonly prescribe them for facial hyperpigmentation/ melasma.It is not meant for regular use and should never be used without a dermatologist's advice and in any case not for more than 2-3 months since the steroid content of this cream can cause various side effects like acne, photosensitivity, skin thinning and telangiectasia and facial hair growth (hirsutism) which is specially troublesome in females.You should definitely stop using it any further.Rather I would suggest you to use a broad spectrum sunscreen, throughout the day to protect from sun since the skin would be sensitive and sun exposure would make it red.The skin would take some time to recover. Till the time your skin recovers from years of steroid abuse you should just use bland moisturising cream for night time application and a broad spectrum sunscreen during the day.Regards"},{"Patient":"hii doc my name is rehnuma and im 20 years old my problem is my skin which is oily and it gets darkened and very oily within 1hr after i fash my face and i hav also got many blackheads and blemishes can you plz suggest me any cream to keep up my fair skin","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for your query.Oily skin and acne/blemishes go hand in hand.First of all you must use a cleanser specifically suitable for oily skin. Salicylic acid in 2% is available as foam or gel based cleanser and is ideal for oily and acne prone skin. Use it twice daily.Besides oral retinoids e.g Low dose Isotretinoin in a dose of 5 mg are also sebostatic and can be considered in your case.Topically, you can use a retinoid gel e.g Adapalene or Azaleic acid gel. They are comedolytic and therefore would benefit acne and post acne pigmentation.Topical clindamycin gel or benzoyl peroxide gel are also specifically meant for acne.These are all prescription medications, I would suggest that you seek an appointment with a dermatologist before trying these.Regards"},{"Patient":"i would like to ask that if i use SUPER VASMOL KESH KALA OIL (NATURAL BLACK) on my eyebrows, my eyebrows very thin & light colour, thatswhy i want to darken them, will it have any side effects on my eyes? kindly suggest and advice on this as i have read that use of some product is harmful or blindness to eyes when applied on eyebrows. thanks rekha","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to healthcare magic.I understand from your query that you are concerned about colouring your eyebrows.There is no problem in colouring your eyebrows as long as you are not allergic to the hair colour. If you are allergic, it could cause severe reaction like redness and swelling. The skin around the eyes is very delicate and the colour could seep into the skin and cause pigmentation when used for prolonged time.You could apply a small amount of dye behind your ear and observe for 2 days for any reaction. If you get any itching or redness, you should avoid applying the colour as it suggests an allergy.If thin eyebrows alone is your concern ( and not the colour), you could try 0.03% Bimatoprost ophthalmic solution applied twice a day to thicken them. This should be used only under the supervision of a dermatologist as this too is associated with side effects rarely.Hope this helps you.Take care."},{"Patient":"i had a pimple on my cheek few days back which has left a bad scar. can you suggest me something to apply to remove the scar? i have combination skin.

Only tretinoin or glycolic acid based creams can help to some extent but the results are very subtle and unpredictable and works for very mild scars only.Therefore, I would suggest you to go for laser therapy (Fractional Co2 laser, Non-ablative RF etc) as it has the best results of all other treatment modalities. Moreover, if additionally treated with dermaroller or 100%TCA peel (CROSS technique), pretty appreciable results can be achieved. For dark lips use a good quality moisturizing lip balm with added sunscreen agents (SUNKROMA LIP BALM).

I read somewhere that skin whitening creams(which contain hydroquinone) are harmful and might lead to cancer.Please suggest me on this?Tell me good and bad effects of using DepiWhite cream..Thank you!","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to healthcare magic.I understand from your query that you are concerned about the long term side effects of depiwhite cream.Depiwhite is a cream used to lighten hyperpigmentation and not to improve the general complexion.Your skin tone is determined at the time of your birth itself and it is decided by the concentration of melanocytes and circulation. Therefore any treatment or procedures can never make you fairer than what you were at the time of birth. But most of the people will acquire more pigmentation as age increases, we call it facultative pigmentation. Lot of factors determine it, most important being sunlight, others include dust, pollution, smoking, less hydration, intrinsic ageing and free radical damage, stress etc.Treatments should be to bring your pigmented skin back to your normal skin tone and make the skin tone even all over the face. Depiwhite contains hydroquione which is a potent bleaching agent. Though its association with cancer is controversial, it is well known to cause side effects like \\" rebound pigmentation\\" and \\" ochronosis\\". Rebound pigmentation, as is self explanatory is recurrence of pigmentation after prolonged use. To prevent this, you need to maintain its effect and prevent darkening using a sunscreen and other agents like Kojic acid and vitamin C. Ochronosis is a less common side effects and occurs due to deposition of a brownish black pigment in the skin after prolonged use of hydroquinone. This is very difficult to get rid off once it develops.Hence I suggest you to use a face wash twice a day ideally a one containing glycolic acid as it helps in exfoliation and to even out the skin tone.You may consult a dermatologist practicing cosmetology for few sittings of chemical peels for faster improvement.Hope this helps you.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hiiii...

Chemical peeling is again a similar procedure where superficial layers of skin is removed but here the effect is more profound and it stimulates new skin generation in much better way thus giving you more youthful and radiant skin.Several options are available in chemical peels like glycolic acid, salicyclic acid, TCA but my personal favorite is retinol peel or also known as Yellow peel.The rationale of combining these procedure is to get better and long lasting effects.I am sure 6-8 sessions will bring out a pretty gratifying results.At home the results can be maintained with antioxidant tablets like Antoxid HC once daily in morning(It can be safely taken for months together) and  night application of cream containing mixture of glycolic acid , arbutin and Kojic acid. In morning you can apply a good quality sunscreen with additional skin lightening ingredients (NILTAN SPF).Use a good quality facewash like Fash facewash gel.Take plently of fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet and indulge into regular exercise for healthy skin and body.Hope this was useful.Let me know if I can be of any more assistance.Thank you and take care,Dr Hardik PitrodaM.D Dermatology"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor...

Stress can increase acne and since you have polycystic ovarian disease there are two factors that are leading to your breakouts...First of all relax cause treatment is not out of reach and isotretinoin with azithromycin is a good combination. isotretinoin initially causes increase in acne so it is combined with azithromycin...it takes about a month to show results and believe me it does work wonders. Don't loose heart, stop binge eating(fried food, ice cream, butter, chocolates), relax, exercise and most of all do not fiddle or touch the acne as that can leave deeper scars.

This occurs due to excessive oil secretion by the oil glands on the face.One of the causes for this is excessive washing of the face. When you wash your face too many times, it strips the natural oil from the face and paradoxically increases the activity of the oil glands to compensate for the loss of natural oils.Wash your face with a cleanser containing 2% salicylic acid twice a day.Do not use thick creams. Avoid oiling your hair.Avoid fried foods and foods with high glycemic index.Hope this helps you.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi I m using skinlite since 2 month s i m not getting a satisfying result. I want to get fair could u please help me and suggests me something more to get fair as soon as possible..make sure the treatment is not much expensive.. Waiting for ur favourable reply...

The increase in color may be due to different factors like sun exposure, poor hygiene,internal diseases,nutritional deficiencies and poor nutrition. Complete body check up should be done to confirm that you do not have any disease or nutritional deficiency. Skinlite cream should be avoided as it contains harmful chemical..hydroquinone. To improve color of the face you avoid sun exposure, it causes tanning effect which ultimately darkens the skin. You apply sun screen gel like sun mask aquagel. You may apply kojic acid,vitamin C and arbutin containing cream on the face at night. And cleanse the face with glycolic acid and kojic acid containing face wash. You may take glutathion,viramin C and nicotininic acid tab orally for long time. You might feel better after few months.I hope you got my answer.ThanksDr. Ilyas Patel MD"},{"Patient":"hi Doc.... my name is Avgbgs.... i m from Gujarat.... i want to know that...Celin 500 mg can use for lighting my skin tone....??? and how long it should be taken....???? and suggest me some skin lighting cream which is available in Gujarat easily...

My skin had never been so dark after the peel earlier. though the peeling has started. Is it ok?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to healthcaremagicI would think that the peel was stronger this time as compared to last time OR it was kept for a longer time than before, therefore it may have acted more as compared to last time, thus leading on to irritation with resulting post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.Cosmopeel contains Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and is considered to be one of the stronger peels. The end point of cosmo peel is frosting and mild erythema, when the peel should be neutralized, immediately. However some times the peel can act more aggressively either because higher concentration is used or it is left for a little longer than the end point, thus causing more frosting and deeper erythema and later post inflammatory hyperpigmentation.I would suggest that you use a moderately potent topical steroid cream, twice daily over the affected area(flutivate cream) for a few days. This would facilitate the superficial dark, dead skin  peel off and would also help in resolving post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.Sun protection with a broad spectrum sunscreen is advisable to prevent sun induced darkening.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor .I m 21 year old girl and I have skin problem since when I was 15 .I have to much pimple white head black heads on my face .

It is a prescription product. Dermatologist's commonly prescribe them for facial hyperpigmentation/ melasma.It won't cause skin cancer, however, it is not meant for regular use and should never be used without a dermatologist's advice and in any case not for more than 2-3 months since the steroid content of this cream can cause various side effects like acne, photosensitivity, skin thinning and telangiectasia and facial hair growth (hirsutism) which is specially troublesome in females.You should definitely stop using it any further.Rather I would suggest you to use a broad spectrum sunscreen, throughout the day and a skin lightening cream containing one or more of the following agents like kojic acid, glycolic acid, arbutin, liquorice, magmebsium ascorbyl phosphate etc at night. These ingredients are safer even if used over a longer duration of time.OR else you could also opt for a few peeling sessions from a dermatologist to enhance your skin. Glycolic acid peeling would produce the desired results of skin lightening, even tone and reduced pore size.Regards"},{"Patient":"my face is little dark comparing it with my body. i want to get fairer. please sent me the answers for the following questions. 1 how to remove tan and spots? 2 how to get long last fairness ? 3 what is the best fairness cream for me ? 4 what are the precautions and food habits to get long last fairness &clear skin","Doctor":"HIThank for asking to HCMI really appreciate your concern looking to the history given here I would like to say that as long as the skin care is concern the best option is fruits have fresh fruits this is the only best option otherwise using any thing beside this is not advisable, hope this information helps you, take care and have a nice day."},{"Patient":"I used Veet Hair removal in my bikinni area this afternoon and some got in my vaginal area.

Apart from mild redness after the sitting which usually resolves in 1-2 hours, there are really no side effects at all, if done by a well trained/experienced expert.Normally 6-8 sittings will give you a good hair reduction. The hair will become finer, the density will decrease and thereby greatly reduced. It is the FDA approved for hair reduction and gives long lasting results.Creams containing ingredients like efflornithine hydrochloride work by inhibiting the hair metabolism thereby reducing the rate of hair growth, but they won't permanently get rid of unwanted hair. They only slow the hair growth rate.Regards"},{"Patient":"My skin got a bit tanned ....so i used melacare cream having hydroquinone to reduce the tan....used it for 3-4 days and one day in the morning washed my face with warm water and applied sun-block cream (for the 1st time).....it caused a burning feeling on my face and now after one day there are red-dark spots on the face similar to burning spots.....please help","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to healthcaremagicYou seem to have developed irritant dermatitis to melacare cream. Melacare cream is a combination of 3 active ingredients tretinoin, hydroquinone and mometasone. Tretinoin as well as hydroquinone have inherent irritant properties and may cause irritation when applied on to face, specially in those who have sensitive skin.I would suggest a moderately potent topical steroid e.g fluticasone propionate cream, to be applied twice daily over the affected area for a few days. That would take care of the irritant dermatitis.Thereafter, you may use a kojic acid based cream to fade away the tan.Always use a broad spectrum sunscreen, throughout the day to prevent further sun induced darkening.Regards"},{"Patient":"I had copper T inserted in 2006 Sep and then i had it for 3 years and got it removed and inserted another one in 2009, recently in Sep 2010 i got it removed again this time to plan for the second child, but its been 4 months now and am still not pregnant, my question is will there be any delays in getting pregnancy after inserting coil for so many years and if so how long should it take to get pregant, is there any cautions i need to take?","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to HCM, thanks for posting your question. I read your question and understood it. See, to be frank, copper T is a foreign body that prevents fertilization. Hence, I would like to tell you that, definitely a foreign body will alter physiology and also the uterus especially when you have used for long time. But there are no supporting papers published that says, it will hamper fertilization. So I suggest you not to worry and keep trying. That should be fine. For about 9 to 12 months you should be able to conceive. If not then you need further evaluation. So, don't put a lot of stress on yourself. Be happy, be confident, positive and see how things go on.

It is a prescription product used for Melasma/Facial Hyperpigmentation.It should not be used as a regular fairness cream and in any case not for more than 2-3 months on face since the steroid content of this cream can cause steroid related adverse effects like acne, photosensitivity, skin thinning and atrophy, hirsutism in females etc.Hydroquinone is banned in some countries because excessive and prolonged use of hydroquinone can cause a condition known as exogenous ochronosis, which is permanent. However, using it for 2-3 months at 2% or 5% concentration, in a combination like melacare is safe and dermatologists commonly prescribe it for hyperpigmentary skin conditions.Tretinoin is an antiageing molecule and it protects against the atrophogenic side effects of mometasone present in melacare cream. Though it can make the skin more sensitive to UV rays, therefore making it necessary to use a sunscreen along with it.Therefore melacare should always be used if your dermatologist prescribes you, not otherwise.Rather than using melacare cream you could use a cream containing other skin lightening agents like kojic acid, glycolic acid, arbutin etc. They are safe even when used over extended periods of time.Remember to wear a broad spectrum sunscreen, throughout the day.Regards"},{"Patient":"My girlfriend and I were dry humping, but no sexual intercourse.

I read your question completely and can understand the situation. I can, with 100% certainty tell that there's absolutely no chance of pregnancy if that was the case as you described. Because.. 1. Dry humping with inner wear on. 2. Semen on leg, near vagina and not inside of vagina. And most importantly, 3. Periods expected next day can never fertilize ovum. According to physiology, ovulation occurs around 14 days before cycles. So you can be tension free and chill out. And yes, the thing that she didn't get her cycles should not worry you.

This will help in reducing the oiliness, help prevent as well as heal pimples and also help lighten the marks.2. apply a water based moisturizer immediately after washing, on slightly damp skin. This is important as anti acne skin regimes often dry the skin and may make it sensitive. Well moisturized skin prevents sensitivity and allows rapid skin repair.3. Use sunscreen in the morning and afternoon. Preferably one containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide that won't block your pores (non-comedogenic). This type of sunscreen is suitable for oily skin. Sunscreen is important as anti acne medications can make your skin sun sensitive, increasing the chances of sun burns.4. Use a adapelene+benzoyl peroxide gel with microsphere or sustained release formulation daily at night after applying your water based moisturizer. Apply a very thin layer only on acne affected areas. Avoid eyelids and corners of mouth. This is the most important part of your daily regime.Follow this regime for a month. If improvement occurs, continue till skin clears completely. If no improvement is seen after a month then you should consider prescription antibiotics and Salicylic+Azelic nanotechnology chemical peels.For more information you can read Skin Care, Acne & Scars at www.dermatologydiaries.comLove your skin,Dr NiketaCosmetic DermatologistMumbai, India"},{"Patient":"i snort crystal meth daily, only a couple of lines.

Apart from that practicing sun protective behavior like carrying an umbrella, avoiding outdoor activity between 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM etc go a long way in preventing further tanning.UV A part of the electromagnetic spectrum is mainly responsible for tanning. Therefore, a good sunscreen should have broad spectrum UV A coverage in addition to UV B coverage, in order to be able to prevent tanning and it needs to be applied in sufficient quantity and every 2-3 hourly.A sunscreen with minimum 30 SPF would be adequate. It should mention both UV B and UV A coverage. Therefore it is important to select the right sunscreen for desired effectsIt should be applied in the following quantity:--3ml for face and neck(a little more than 1/2 teaspoon)--3ml for each arm(a little more than 1/2 teaspoon).A sunscreen should be applied every 2-3 hours.A skin lightening cream containing one or more of the skin lightening ingredients e.g kojic acid, glycolic acid, Arbutin, Magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, Liquorice etc once or twice daily, can be used to gradually fade away the tan.You could also undergo a few sessions of skin lightening peels (Yellow peels/Retinol CT peel) OR Glycolic acid Peels, from a dermatologist to improve the complexion.regards"},{"Patient":"hello DRi don't know if you are right Dr that i chosen or not I wish to help me If i do laser hair removal in any where in my body like underarm ,arms ... is there any danger to my body specialist in underarm there are a lot of glands on it thanks for helping","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HealthcareMagicLaser hair reduction (LHR) is a very safe and reliable way for hair reduction.

It contains a potent steroid, clobetasol propionate which can cause steroid related side effects like Acne, photosensitivity, hirsutism, skin thinning, telangiectasis etc.I would suggest that you use a topical broad spectrum sunscreen throughout the day, that which offers both UV B as well as UV A protection, till your skin returns back to normal, which might take a few days.An OTC antihistamine e.g cetrizine 10mg once daily would help you symptomatically with the itch.If I was the treating doctor I would have started you on oral antibiotics for acne e.g either doxycycline or azithromycin, would be good for acne flare.Topically you could use clindamycin phosphate 1% gel twice daily over active acne.Use a gentle cleanser for  face wash e.g cetaphil cleansing lotion, twice daily.regards"},{"Patient":"Sir My Skin Colour is Dark From Birth And i have Blackheads, Acne,pimples.Sir/madam i asked from a dermatologist she suggested me dermadew acne Soap,Cetaphil Mosturizing lotion, Retino A 0.025%, etc. please tell me the medicines or methods to improve my skin colour without any harm","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to healthcare magic.I understand your concern about your skin colour and pimples.For your pimples, you could use Retino- A cream at bedtime. It is generally not associated with any long term side effects.As far as your skin colour is concerned, you must understand that it is not possible tpo make a dark person fairer. To a certain extent, you ca prevent further darkening of skin as a result of sun exposure. You could use a broad spectrum sunscreen every 4 hours. You could also get glycolic acid based chemical peels done by a qualified dermatologist. They help to lighten the acquired tanning and to lighten the skin tone to a certain extent. You could also try oral glutathione supplements under the supervision of a dermatologist. This a relatively new and is showing promising results.Hope this helps you.Take care."},{"Patient":"hi doctor ,m 22 yrs old n my skin is very oily n m getting pimles on my face n back which leaves dark spots n i hav large size pores which does nt look nice ..i wanna go for salicylic acid gel treatment for this problem ,pls guide me weither it is effective or not ?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to healthcaremagicSalicylic acid is commonly used by dermatologist for chemical peeling in those whoc have acne and oily skin. Salicylic acid being lipophilic in nature easily dissolves in the lipid rich pores and breaks the comedones, which are the precursor lesions of acne. Salicylic acid also dries up existing pent up oil in the pores and is therefore also useful for oily skin.Along with salicylic acid peeling, you can also use topical antiacne medication like clindamycin phosphate 1% gel, twice daily.If your acne is inflammatory, you may also benefit from the use of oral antibiotic like either doxycycline or azithromycin or minocycline.regards"},{"Patient":"Using melacare.

Though it improves the complexion /hyperpigmentation  because of the skin lightening ingredients present in it e.g tretinoin, hydroquinone, mometasone but they are not meant for regular use.I would suggest that you use a broad spectrum sunscreen, throughout the day, that which offers both UV B and UV A protection.A skin lightening cream containing one or more of the following ingredients e.g kojic acid, glycolic acid, arbutin, Vit C (magnesium ascorbyl phosphate), liquorice, glabridin  etc can be used once or twice daily.

However there are well known causes like pregnancy, oral contraceptive pills, certain pain killers.Sun protection is an essential part of the management of any pigmentation over face.Therefore, a good sunscreen should have broad spectrum UV A coverage in addition to UV B coverage, in order to be able to prevent tanning and it needs to be applied in sufficient quantity and every 2-3 hourly.I don't see sunscreen in your treatment. A sunscreen with minimum 30 SPF would be adequate. It should mention both UV B and UV A coverage. Therefore it is important to select the right sunscreen for desired effectsIt should be applied in the following quantity:--3ml for face and neck(a little more than 1/2 teaspoon)--3ml for each arm(a little more than 1/2 teaspoon).A sunscreen should be applied every 2-3 hours.You could use a cream contining one or more of the skin lightening agents like kojic acid, hydroquinone, azaleic acid etc, once or twice daily.Besides, you could also opt for chemical peeling sessions from a dermatologist. Chemical peels are very useful for Pigmentation over face. They can be used either alone OR in combination with skin lightening creams.regards"},{"Patient":"\\"Hello.

Skinlite contains hydroquinone as well as topical steroid. It will cause fairness initially but it has many side effects such as thinning of skin, white spots, excessive sensitivity towards sunlight.

Always make sure you use your sunscreen before going out in sun and repeat application after every 3 hours and use proper clothing to cover face. Avoid pricking/scratching/peeling of skin.

It is not recommended to be used for longer periods of time... Now as far as the pigmentation is concerned, i would advise you to regularly use a sunscreen (SPF>26) now before any kind of sun exposure.Also you can use a milder lightening agent containing Kojic acid cream and vitamin C on your face twice a day to reduce the pigmentation.. Also take diet rich in antioxidants and Vitamin C (like citrus fruits, salads) Hope it helps Dr Geetika Paul"},{"Patient":"This is very hard for me to explain.

The color of skin is firmly due to genes you bear. Enviornmental factors also affect skin color...Your friends are misguiding you. Skinlite cream contains hydroquinone, which is definitely toxic chemical. It causes dotted depigmented spots in the skin which remains permenantly. Never use it.For little improvement of color , you use sun screen gel like sun mask aqua gel during the day time. And you may apply kojic acid and vitamin C containing cream at night. Take vitamin C , glutathion and nicotininic acid  tablets for long time. Avoid stress and anxiety, take healthy food ,have good sleep.You may be improved..Do not ashamed of black skin...

When I regained consciousness, my lip was cut in half! My lip is the major problem, after having it operated on twice, both doctors did a horrible stitching job (they're not beauticians).  My lip was left with a bump on it and is visible when I smile. It looks like I have a cleft lip! I feel disfigured, and am extremely self conscious about it. Sometimes it interferes with eating, and my teeth scrape it.  What can I do? Can I go to the emergency room to fix it? Cut off the excess flesh? I could bite it perhaps? These are the insane ideas I've had to live with and contemplate. Could I also be suffering from head trauma? Or accident related trauma? I've been in six car accidents in my life, three on bikes and I am deathly afraid of careless drivers.","Doctor":"Hello,The problem you are complaining of arises from an improper repair of the muscle inside your lip which is known as orbicularis oris. Revisional surgery entails a complete disruption of the repair, stitching the lip in 3 layers with resection of any mucosa that might occur in your case and with particular attention to repair of the orbicularis.

Sunscreen should be applied 30 minutes prior to sun exposure and should be repeated every two to three hourly. Use a sunscreen offering UVA and UVB protection.Apply milder creams with Kojic acid, arbutin vitamin c or Glycolic acid. You may use kojivit cream in morning and glyco a 6 percent cream in night. Do not apply these creams in large quantities and do not rub these creams too much as may cause irritation. These creams are safe in long run. However there use may be discontinued once results are achieved and the effect can be maintained with regular sunscreen use.If possible consult a dermatologist and take few sessions of chemical peels. Take food rich in vitamin c and antioxidants.Hopefully you would have a glowing flawless skin in a month.Take care"},{"Patient":"Hi, I would like to know if there is a way to get fair skin back?

I would like to know if there is any way I could get my original colouring.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to healthcare magic Your complexion is usually decided at the time you are born. No treatments can make a person fairer than their original color.  In your case you had fairer skin when you were younger, so there is scope for improvement. Sun protection is the key to a lighter skin. As much as possible avoid direct sunlight, wear a sunscreen with an spf of at least 15 every day in the morning half an hour before you go out an re apply it every 3-4 hours. You can use a face wash containing Glycolic acid twice a day. Lightening creams like kojic acid and or vitamin c serums will help. You can go for a cosmetology consultation and cosmetic services like chemical peels can be tried. Even mesotherapy with vitamin c and or glutathione will help. Drink plenty of water, eat fruits rich in vitamin A and C. Hope this helped Take care"},{"Patient":"I am on cilest contraceptive pill and have 9 pills left in my pack.

This hollow groove (called the naso-jugal groove) forms as a natural result of fatty tissue loss during the process of aging. Shadows fall into the groove, causing the appearance of under eye dark circles. Bags under the eyes are caused by fatty tissue visibly protruding within the lower eyelid. Once again, a shadow falls into the groove underneath the bags and the person looks tired and olderRenowned eyelid surgeon Dr. Rivkin has created a non-invasive, safe and cost effective method to remedy circles under the eyes without surgery.Blepharoplasty Non-Surgical Removal of Dark Eye Circles.Topical creams and similar products are another alternative treatment.

It seems you are quite stressed with your dark complexion. There are many methods of lightening of dark complexion up to a certain stage but you along with your dermatologist has to see the safety issues with short term or long term usage of these things. Now it is totally Upto  you to what extent you want to go, even you may find some fascinating advertizements regarding fairness but again comes the side effects and actual usage. Now coming to your point directly, you can use glycolic acid and azealic acid creams under dermatological guidance. Both glycolic acid and azealic acid creams are present in low and high strengths, so try using low strength first and then gradually can shift over to higher strength. These are able to give results in 3- 4 months continuous and judicious use and are safe for long term use also. The next thing to tell you behind beauty is that it is not the color but the glow on the skin which actually counts. This can be achieved with good sun protection by physical barrier as umbrella and  sunscreen usage 2-3 times a day half an hour before moving out. Eat a lot of fruits (all yellow and red) containing a lot of carotenoids and vitamins which can act as best sunscreen. Include green leafy vegetables and salads which will act as natural sunscreen ( best for you) and drink at least more than 10 glasses of water per day. Lastly love your skin and love yourself there must be certain things which nobody can match up. Keep glowing!!!

At what age should I expect full growth, also, I think I have noticed my beard growing sligthly quicker when I exercice, this beeing from the raise in testosterone I assume right? I know my questions are a little all over the place, I would really appreciate an asnwer to all of them","Doctor":"Hi Manu, Welcome and thanks for posting your query to HCM. So you are worried about the growth of facial  hair (rather beards) in uniform manner. now to solve your queries: 1. Our growth in all manners continues till 25 years of life, so the new growth of facial hair on beard will also be growing till that time. It all depends on the family pattern and genes which we carry from our ancestors. So, basically it will be depending on your parents side. 2. Neither acne or acne scars and creams prevent the growth of hair. None of the chemicals in acne creams are responsible to prevent hair growth in general. But if the scars are quite deep then at that localized area only you can have damage to hair root, overall is negligible unless you have deep scars all over face. 3. Yes due to exercise we do have bit of increased metabolic rate leading to good hair growth. Lastly there is no medical treatment in this world which can cause growth of hair in only beard area and your questions are exactly the same which a young man have ( and even i had when I was at your age) so don't worry and be happy. With best health and beard wishes, Dr Sanjay K Kanodia"},{"Patient":"hello doctor.... im diya.. i heard abt this skin lite cream frm my frnd... bfr using dis cream she was very dark... n nw she s totally changed she luks awesome... seeng her result im very eager to use dis cream... but im afraid of its side effects... is it adviceable to use dis cream?? if at al i usd cn i use fr a month n stop it??","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to Healthcare Magic Forum Skinlite cream contains hydroquinone + Tretinoin + steroid..it is a triple combination commonly used by dermatologists for treating hyperpigmentation,,,but one has to use this cream with caution.

So this should not be taken as a Over the counter drug.

Instead, you can opt for some milder lightening  agents which can be used harmlessly for a longer period of time You can start using a lightening agent like kojic acid with vitamin C twice a day. Along with it, you should continously use a sunscreen( spf>26) over your face before going out in the sun..Also take oral vitamin C supplementation continously for a month or so...

I went to see a gynaecologist and he recommended me to start a dose of clomid but that same day i just happened to be late on my period and i was pregnant! 4 weeks later i went for a scan and i had an unembryonic pregnancy even though i suffered the symptoms and had to have it aborted!

You can track your ovulation by repeated ultrasound and when your follicles is more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 to 6 months.  Hope I have answered your question.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hello. My name is Sarah.

You must apply this 20 -30 mins before going out. Reapply after 4-6 hours .Using this even if you are not exposed to sun directly is recommended. 2) To reduce existing pigmentation ,you may consider going for Glycolic peels with a qualified dermatologist once every 15-30 days for a few sittings and then maintain the results using the above protective measure. 3) Vitamin C orally (1000mg) per day for 3 months will help lightening faster. 4) For the darker areas, you may consider using creams having Glycolic acid or Kojic acid and Vit.C 5) Do not use OTC moisturizers before sun-exposure. several OTC products have photosensitizing agents and actually make the skin darker .It is good to use the sunscreen alone or if the skin is dry ,you may use medicated moisturizers like Cetaphil etc. Hope this is helpful..Take care!"},{"Patient":"I am 33 years old and I used betnovate for the last 10 years on my face to get clean and smooth face.

Your dermatologist will be able to help you out in this regard. Kojivit is a safe cream which you can try for your pigmentation. It will improve but usually won't go completely. Have a balanced diet. Eat plenty of citrus fruits (Vitamin C), Carrots and other colored fruits(Vitamin A). Meat, poultry and fish is rich in Vitamin B12. Avoid excessive sunlight exposure and wear a sunscreen daily.

You can do a scan after 2 days and if your follicle's mean size is more than 18 mm, you can take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for 2 to 3 days after injection.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  Hope I have answered your question.

Or pls suggest some more effective cream, my skin is very oily. Thanks you so much","Doctor":"Hello Gaurav, Welcome to Healthcare Magic Melalite XL contains a mid potent steroid, retinoid and hydroquinone. It is a cream to be used only under doctors supervision and is not meant to be used for long term. It can cause rosacea, thinning of skin, redness and increased sensitivity to sunlight if used for long duration. I would recommend you to slowly decrease the frequency of application to twice a week, then once a week and stop  the cream and add on a kojic acid or arbutin containing cream daily at night. Sun protection with sunscreen is an absolute must. Apply sunscreen ideally a gel formulation as you have an oily skin and you are pimple prone. Reapply sunscreen every 3-4 hours daily. Cosmetic procedure like glycolic peels  will help you. You can consult a cosmetologist for the same. For dark circles life style modification is important. Sleep well, drink plenty of water, avoid spending too much time in front of television and lap top and have a balanced diet. A diet rich in Vitamin C like citrus fruits will help. hope this helped take care"},{"Patient":"I had a mini face lift in May of 2012. Behind one of my ears there is some weeping of a yellowish fluid. The first time, I used an entire box of kleenex. This month a little came out 3-10-13 and 3-31-13. When the fluid is going to come out, it starts to hurt, and I feel as though I am starting with an ear ache. My Dr. said it is not inflamed but I am worried because the fluid comes out of this little spot. I just don t think there should be an opening almost a year after surgery. What do you think???","Doctor":"Hello, No, there should not be an opening in that area after almost a year after surgery. Some degree of serous collection is present in the area as is apparent from your description therefore you need a thorough examination to see if there is evidence of any infection especially since the area hurts and the weeping is recurrent."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor,I wanted to know how to increase fat on cheecks???

But both are quite expensive procedure needing expert person to do it.There is no oral medicine or oral food supplements available to make your cheeks chubby. So don't get carried away by any advertizements related to this. You even may harm your body by such kind of fake things as some these may contain anabolic steroids.Yes, your main treatment is - Diet, Diet & Diet...that too good nourishing diet. This is the most time tested thing in this world since ages. Now what to eat is - everything which you like - but with good caloric index. It means high energy food with good amount of proteins & fats. You are quite learned lady who don't need explanations on high energy food or can consult a dietician for the guidance. But even then you can follow the regimen below:Take multiple small feeds/ day.Eat 3-4 fruits/day.Take sprouts if you are vegetarian or can take eggs also.10-15 almonds overnight soaked in water.Eat and drink milk and milk products in plenty.Do not forget to do yoga or exercises also.If you try and follow above, gradually after a period of 3 -6 months you would be able to see good changes.

It is one of the triple combinations that is widely used by dermatologists all over. It is a good and effective agent if used under medical supervision. Using such combinations as  OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS  is not really recommended. Yes, there is no doubt that it does improve the skin tone when used. It is used by dermatologists for  various hyperpigmented skin conditions. But i would recommend you not to use it without prior assessment and recommendation by a skin specialist. One of the known problems with such medications is that it can cause hyperpigmentation , if not used properly and as advised by a dermatologist. Such medications have to be used only for a limited period of time. Excessive use can cause problems. Also these are to used only at night time.

Can it be used on face? 2. Can it be used by men? 3. Will it cause any side effects in future? 4. What precautions do we need to take while using it. Please clarify the above points.","Doctor":"Hello Thanks for posting your query You said that you are not very dark. My suggestion is only to apply a good sun screen half an our before you go out.  That will keep your skin texture intact and will prevent from sun tan and darkening. Creams like Brite contains hydroquinone and has only bleaching effect. It is like going to a parlor. It is not a permanent remedy and you may have to apply continuoulsly. It definitely produces side effects in the long run especially reddening of face and the steroid will produce increased facial hair  under the eyes. Retinoic acid produces burning sensation when you go out in sun light. As no medication can change the texture permanently and without side effects it is better to accept our own color and be with it. have a nice day pvs prasad"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have a really deformed stomach area after over injecting my insulin for a number of years.

Failures in treatment and commonly observed adverse reactions usually result from this mismatch.

As for regular care of skin ,you should use a sensitive mild cleanser.Try to use a Retinoid topically at night. Orally you should have supplements containing Vit C and Vit E to reduce the free radical induced damage to body and prevent aging changes.You also should apply non comedogenic moisturizers containing Vit A and E in the morning.It is very important to avoid sun exposure and apply a broad spectrum sunscreen when you go out.Green tea is a good source of anti oxidants as well.So you can start having it.

What can I do to help with this problem that I am having?","Doctor":"Hi, These areas of post inflammatory hyperpigmentation and scab formation could be due to laser burns. The chances of pigmentation after lasers is higher in candidates with darker skin type. If the spots are not too dark, you may apply steroid cream for few days to lighten pigmentation. If they are too dark, you may use a hydroquinone based cream. Use a good sunscreen on daily basis.

These can be used alone or in combination as per the skin's requirement. in your case, you may begin with these Use a good sunscreen daily Taking vitamin c and antioxidant supplements would be beneficial. Vitamin c helps in collagen synthesis and antioxidants prevents free radical damage Use a good moisturiser suitable to your skin type to keep your skin well hydrated. There is no harm in using tretinoin( vitamin A derivative). Tretinoin induces collagen production and helps in shedding of dead layers of skin thus helping in reducing fine lines. However it may irritate your skin. Use it in small quantities in night and do not rub it over face. Use of sunscreen in morning is mandatory with retinoids as it makes skin sensitive to sun. Initially in the beginning use it for two hours and as the skin sensitivity decreases you may apply it overnight. As you are still 29, you may also use a night cream with vitamin A,C,E to prevent ageing. The chances of irritation with such creams would be less as compared to tretinoin. Hope that answers your query. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi can you help me please, I have rhinoplasty 2 days ago, my nose was completly fine before it just I had a big rounded tip and wanted to change it to pointy tip, after my surgery my nose is tilted to one side..

Dont get disappointed as it will take sometime for swellings to settle down and final remoulding takes place. After analysing final result then only some repair work can be considered if required. I can understand you anxiety to get the result as you expected but premature tampering with friable, unstable and swolled tissues of your nose will cause more harm than benefit.

I don t want to spend so much on something that wouldn t make me feel good about myself.Also i heard that a chin augumentation will affect my smile. I was wondering if it is worth it to get and if it really will affect my smile?thanks!","Doctor":"Chin augmentation can affect your smile due to following reasons:- During the procedure of putting the implant certain nerves responsible for movement of lower lip can be damaged(Partially, totally or just get stretched). this will cause defective movements of lower lip hence affecting you smile. It may take few weeks to as long as 18months for these damaged nerves to recover. besides movements lower lip can become numb(i.e. less sensation) Also as lower lip and chin are part full expression of smile any change in shape and size will defenitely affect the overall smile which may or may not be better than you your original smile. An experienced cosmetic surgeon can help you to come to conclusion that whether the new smile will be more approprite and attractive than the present situtaion. There are many computer animations programs available to predict your future smile, You must consider above mentioned points before undergoing surgery. Also you should have enough conviction and patience to undergo surgery and wait for final result. Cosmetic surgery is not suited for impatient and emotionalyy unstable personalities.

It seems due to improper application of the above mentioned skin creams, you developed an irritant reaction. Right now you need to apply a steroid cream like mometasone cream where your skin has peeled off. It will not only reduce burning but also alleviate the redness.

Eating high-fiber foods, which aid in elimination, can also help reduce belly fat. Choose a diet that is rich in whole grains Practice aerobic exercise.  At least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise on a daily basis. The best type of aerobic activity is the kind that you enjoy doing. Practice total body strength training. Strength training exercises raise your metabolic rate, so you are actually burning more calories in your resting state. Additionally, performing exercises for the upper back will improve your posture, which will in turn make your abs look flatter. Stay hydrated. Drink more water 8-12 glasses. Improve your posture. The way you stand can make it seem as if you have more belly fat than you really do. Be consistent in your efforts & you will notice the results.

It generally affects healing in the immediate post operative period as smoking leads to decreased oxygen supply to the wound by increased carbon dioxide levels and constriction of blood vessels leads to decreased blood supply to the wound. Apart from that various other chemicals in the smoke cause cell damage hence affects healing. Any scar after either operation or trauma takes at least 9 months to one year to completely mature up. In your case the redness of scar after 7 months of operation may be due to many factors, most common of them is that it may be due to scar is still immature and active healing process is still taking place but at abnormally high pace hence it is still red due to increased healing activity. Smoking delays the maturing of scars. hence I suggest that you should stop smoking, at least till the scar become mature, whitish and fades away. If the scar starts becoming thick and itchy it means abnormal healing is going on and must consult your operating surgeon. Meanwhile you should massage three to four time per day the scar by cold cream.

So i stopped that. now it is okay. so please suggest me some fairness cream. from neck onwards i am so fair except face. so please do me needful. i from cuddalore in tamilnadu","Doctor":"Hi, One should always try to achieve one's constitutive skin colour as how much hard one tries a person with dusky complexion cannot become fairer by applying creams. Do not apply creams containing hydro quinine, steroids and tretinoin just to achieve a fairer skin tone as in long run it will harm your skin irreversibly. Just to have a good skin tone, use a good sunscreen with SPF more than 40 in between 10 am  to 4 pm and repeat it every three to four hours if out in sun. One can use mild skin creams containing Kojic acid ,liquorice, arbutin , vitamin c, vitamin b3 and vitamin b5 on daily basis to improve one's skin tone. Also few sessions of chemical peels can be taken to exfoliate the skin and improve the skin tone. Similarly mesotherapy with vitamin c and glutathione can improve the skin colour to certain extent. However, as a doctor I would always promote a skin regime to have a healthy glowing even toned skin rather than striving for a fairer skin.Take care."},{"Patient":"hi my name is kelly i had a revision rhinoplasty june 8th about a week and a half ago i went into the sun for a few hours without spf and was drinking.

A simple scratch should not be able to change the form of the reconstructed framework of the nose too much but if the scratch has been deep this is a possibility.

The treatment of Romberg's disease varies but the general method is filling in of the atrophic tissues. Depending on the area involved, a variety of materials can be used. It is generally not advisable to use fillers for a large area because of their cost and the need for refilling a couple of times. The best material is either fat grafting or a dermofat graft. There is a degree of absorption in the long run which can be quite unpredictable so that revisions can be needed and because of which the area is overfilled in the initial stage. Ultimately, however, the fat or dermofat graft that tends to stay stays for a long duration of time and gives appreciable results."},{"Patient":"i had a rhinoplasty 6 days ago.my cast was removed on 4 day. i asked the dr. to pinch my nose at the bottom. i was happy with the result but i am very disappointed my nose tilted at the right side after surgery. i am worried is it just swelling or it is crooked.. it give unusal shape to my nose everyone cn easily notice that..","Doctor":"hello after rhinoplasty the swelling remains for around 2-3 weeks but it should not give deviated or tilted appearance to the nose. for now just wait for the swelling to get reduced then only you will be able to know the difference. if needed revision rhinoplasty can be done latter on to correct any deformity regards"},{"Patient":"last year i had an accident on a bike and i had a cut over my uppers lips and i had three stitches which later turned out to be unlabeled and cud see some gaps like appearances.

The thing is that the scar removal is a complicated process,it depends upon several factors like its structure,texture,thickness and location etc. The consultation should involve a Skilled dermatologist plus a plastic surgeon to decide what treatment option would give the best results. Ur question really depends on how does your scar looks and which type of lasers you have been offered and by whom?

I have two queries around this 1) Can it be made using rose water or aloe vera juice also .i.e to wash it intermittently with rose water / aloe juice or any other herb juice or additons to make it more effective along with washing it wit water 2) which mantras are supposed to be chanted while washing the same Thanks,","Doctor":"Dear Naresh You have based your query on three things      shat dhaut ghrit, rose water and  aloe vera. Well dear self use of medicines is never recommended be it any as the causative factor or prakriti of the person may differ. Shat dhaut ghrit is made by washing butter with tap water for one hundred times, by doing so the excess greasy part of butter is washed off and it becomes an ointment. As it is made of butter which is known as builder of body or tonic so its nutrient effect is well established. It becomes one of the best moisturisers. But if your skin is already acutely oily and your prakriti is Kaphaj and your Kaph dosh is vitiated then such thing are not recommended till vitiation becomes normal. Yes when all these factors are favourable it adds to gain wrinkle free glowing skin. Rose water is like a coolant refreshing and gives a good feeling besides being a mood elevator. Internally it balances Pit and is mildly laxative. A mixture of rose water lemon juice and glycerine is an age old skin remedy for glowing skin. It becomes a very good moisturiser. Aloe vera is best liver tonic and laxative when taken internally. It has many more anti oxidant properties. Being in the form of gel in natural state its moisturising effect and anti oxidant effect helps skin look young and glowing. I can not specify mantras, but pure , peaceful and happy mind is the base of good health as in our case it is mind over body, and mantras create an atmosphere of faith and self confidence joined with divine blessings. I have full faith in Gyatri mantra,and mritunjaya mantra, if you believe you can chant the same.

However, they can be converted into lighter, finer scars which easily blend in the surrounding skin and are apparent only on close inspection. During early stages of scar formation, some scar modulation agents (popularly available anti scar cremes) can be used. These if prescribed should be started immediately after healing is complete and latest by 4 weeks of healing. If used after that period of time they are not much useful. As both the scars are more than a year old and unlikely to improve with cremes, you should plan a scar revision surgery. It is a minor procedure during which your bad scars will be removed to produce one thin scar. Then, you should use scar modulating cremes to further improve the quality of this scar.

If no implant was placed during surgery, there is no need to worry. The pimple will go away. However, if an implant was placed this could be implant infection. In that case, antibiotic trial is suggested, which you have already received. Salvaging the implant in this condition will be rather difficult.

I always have to rush to the toilet to scratch it off with water and my fingernails!","Doctor":"Heya kimi. I empathise with your problem. It is not an uncommon one. You have what is called 'angular cheilitis' & it can have many causative factors but in your case, an 'allergy' to components of your lip gloss may be the likely implicated factor. You may want to consider a vitamin B (riboflavin) deficiency & may add a vitamin B supplement to your diet. I know this will sound difficult, but please avoid all lip products at least for the next 2 weeks. Drink lots of water/fluids & hydrate yourself. A neutral lip balm/moisturizer frequently used each 2 hrs or so, will be beneficial. After two weeks, you may wish to employ hypoallergenic lip products of quality available on the market.

This generally includes liposuction of the neck and jawe  region, as well as tightening of the platysma muscle (responsible for loose bands in the neck) 2) \\"deep plane\\" facelift, meaning the deep layer of tissue beneath the skin is lifted and tightening, providing an often dramatic but very natural rejuvenation of the face. Often, a full facelift will also involve a browlift. 3) A \\"midface lift\\" addresses the cheek pad and nasolabial folds or smile lines. Candidates for a midface lift include patients with heaviness below the cheek prominence and above the jaw., These patients often present with dark circles or hollowness beneath the eyes, which are due to a descent of the malar fat pad. The mid face is lifted through a small incision in the hair-bearing temple or under the eye. 4) The direct neck lift is a popular alternative among patients with prominent neck aging or \\"turkey gobbler neck,\\" who may not be concerned about the jaw or cheek regions. The excess neck skin and fat can be removed with a well hidden incision under the chin. This procedure generally requires only local anesthetic or mild sedation. 5) Fat grafting or fat transfer at the time of facelift surgery has become a popular choice patients. While a facelift will tighten skin and remove or reposition drooping tissues, many patients also have volume loss in areas such as the temples, the area below the eyes, the cheek pads, and the lips.

I ve never had problems with my skin until about a year ago, when I started breaking out beside my mouth and on my cheeks. It spread as I experimented with cleansers and benezoyl peroxide , effectively covering my face, but my forehead remained clear. Three months ago I started Yasmin 21 and it stopped all new acne from forming, but I still have lots of post hyper pigmentation. What would be the best way to clear up the red marks left by hormonal acne?","Doctor":"Hello, Are you having only lots of hyperpigmentations or are you also having acne scars as well as complications of acne pimples? However, in order to answer your question about to get rid of acne hyperpigmentations, you need to undergo the following treatments carried out by an expert in the field of aesthetic medicine and laser aesthetic medicine: 1. Glycolic acid peels for hyperpigmentations and uniformizing the skin coloration. 2. Microdermabrasion: may help get rid of both acne scars and hyperpigmentations. 3. Laser removal of hyperpigmentations with the help of a Q-Switched Nd: YAG Laser. 4. Fractional CO2 laser treatment in case of acne scars in combination with hyperpigmentations. Use some very good hydrating/moisturizing serums/gels, skin nourishing/bio-activating and skin normalizing (turning fatty skin into normal skin) creams/products after any of the above-mentioned treatments. As a matter of precaution, after a treatment, also avoid direct sun exposure in order to prevent the appearance of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentations (PIH) after any of the above treatments done. Use a very good sun screen or sun block cream (SPF 50) in order to keep your skin away from any sun-induced hyperpigmentations."},{"Patient":"Sir i am 19 year old boy i have wrinkle , pimple ,black marks in my face as well as i feel that my face is shrinking hole time sir pleas let me some tip. give me any cream name please ..","Doctor":"Hi...dear anupama., Thanks for choosing HCM.., Wrinkling and Pimples..., good treatment is there.., 1) 1% clindamycin cream nighttimes.., 2) Use SUNSCREEN LOTION ..in night times.., 3) Tab...Betacarotene and lycopene..daily for 30 days.., 4) Take plenty of oral fluids( fruit juices-without sugar).., plenty of green leafy vegetables and fruits.., ok..

Hope the situation now is fine. But in future if you get any similar situation or bad times please consult a psychiatrist instead of harming yourself. You don't have to feel embarrassed to tell your story to any doctor. Doctors are there  to help patients and relieve their problems.  They come across all kinds of patients. So feel free to consult doctors. The management of scars depends on how bad are they. The very fact that you have asked for an advice indicates it must be visibly bad. So please go for cosmetic surgery. Only clean surgical scars without any secondary infection, generally do not need anything. After an year they almost become invisible.

The problems you are talking about are Acne , Blackheads , dilated pores and scars after healed acne. Typically, people with oily skin tend to have enlarged pores that secrete excess oil, or sebum. Larger pores are also more likely to get clogged with dead skin cells, dirt, and bacteria. Dermatologists generally treat acne-related conditions with topical antimicrobials that help disinfect the skin, and topical retinoids to help unclog pores and prevent white or blackheads from forming. For more moderate or severe cases of acne, an oral antibiotic like erythromycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, or minocycline may be prescribed. The fact is you can’t get rid of your pores, or even shrink them, but you can cleanse and care for your skin in ways that make pores less visible. And that includes staying out of the sun as too much sun exposure reduces the amount of collagen in our skin, and that also causes pores to expand. Laser Treatment for the scars of acne as well as pigmentation may be helpful to you as well .(Fr Erb Glass Laser). Avoid oily foods and oily cream applications on your face and have plenty of water.

The cut marks on your upper extremity which you have mentioned your hand is most probably your volar aspect of wrist  which are known as suicidal attempt  marks.They usually are visualized as hypertrophied scars.The treatment has to have these prerequisites : 1) The scars should be mature - more than about a year old with no blanching , itching or pain in it . 2) No active wound or systemic or regional infection should be present near it The treatment options depend upon the number of scars and the area involved If they are in a limited area : It can be revised with excision of previous scars and infiltrating it with Injections followed by few applications of ointments and compression along with silicon gel sheet (Once the stitches are removed ) This is followed by multiple sitting of fractional CO2 laser for resurfacing and making the scars most inconspicuous. If the covered area is very extensive resurfacing of the defect can be done by tissue expanding the adjacent skin of the limb and then advancing the adjacent skin over this which leave just a faint line of the advanced flap which can further be resurfaced by fractional laser.

Instead opt for creams for Vitamin C creams and serums which is an antioxidant and an whitening agent. Remember to apply sunscreen with SPF30 in the day time. And always remember brown skin tone is a beautiful skin color and is due to the melanin pigment present in our asian skin.

My dear, whatever may happen never refer to yourself as ' ugly'. Beauty is a perception... and its not always external.... ! Dark color of your arms and legs could be due to harmful effects of Sun. First and foremost always apply sunscreen. The right method of application is that apply liberally, 10 - 15 min before steppin out into the sun and re apply after 2-3 hours. A broad spectrum sunscreen such as 'Suncross aquagel' will be good and non sticky for a tropical climate. For lightening you can try creams such as 'Kojivit' but considering it is a large body part it is usually not convinent to apply creams. You can opt for Chemical peels such as Glycolic or TCA peels, for which your cosmetologist  can guide you. At home you can try a mix of gram flour(besan) with milk, apply like a paste keep for 5 min and wash it off, you can do this 2-3 times a week and follow it with a moisturizing lotion.

The right ovary is behind the uterine boday, with simple cyst of 1.5 cm (dominant follicular cyst). No free fluid in the Douglas pouch. My question is will i be able to have a good pregnancy? Thank you :-)","Doctor":"Hi , How are you doing ? You can surely try & will surely get a healthy pregnancy. Let me say why. You are in right age ( 19-35 yrs) You have proved yourself healthy to get pregnant, twice . Your scan is absolutely normalForget the follicle. Only if follicle is > 25-30 mm it will be called cyst, that too after the time of ovulation. One thing I would advise isConfirm tubal patency- most important- Tube is the connection           between uterus & ovaries( the bridge where sperm meets the egg &           forms a baby) this is size of hair follicle & cannot be seen on scans.           Being such a small opening tube can get blocked easily,            So check with HSG( Xray with dye), or SSG ( Scan with dye) or           LaparoscopyIf all this done & found normal , nothing can stop a pregnancy with God's willHope I have cleared your query, do write back if any more queriesAll the bestDr.Balakrishnan"},{"Patient":"what s the dangerous if we use coffee to do mask ? female 23 years old....i use these mask(coffee mask) and i want to know if there is any dangerous or any side effect??as i heard that it help in hair growth after i use it .is it true?? and its really serious problem.....please i really need help...","Doctor":"hi welcome to health care magic, Coffee has no role in hair growth rather it may cause hair damage and discoloration.

I am 153cm and weight 81.5kg and I dont have any medical history.","Doctor":"Hi , How are you doing ? PCOD ( Polycystic ovaries),This is a congenital condition, I mean it is a genetically programmed condition, you get it from your parents. When you suddenly put on weight, this cholesterol is converted into estrogen hormone ( if I may simulate- haven't you seen obese men developing breast & in young obese girls, who develop periods at younger age - they all have high levels of Estrogen hormone / female hormone) In your body too when fat, which is a store for tomorrow,is more than normal, this is converted to hormone which tips the balance between FSH (from brain ) & the ovarian hormone. FSH( Follicle Stimulating Hormone ) as name suggests stimulates follicle from ovary, but once the follicle is big enough to ovulate, the FSH is suppressed by the same estrogen hormone from ovary. But when the same estrogen hormone is coming from fat, brain is confused & follicle growth stops early at a smaller follicle size & will not rupture, next scan you will see all these follicles as POLY CYSTIC OVARIES.!!! this is usually associated with Obesity, irregular cycles, no periods for few months & later heavy periods with clots & fleshy masses, or spotting on & off , Thyroid abnormality & prolactin problem indirectly.You develop that extra-pad of fat around the mid-segment of body, especially waist, thighs & breast, no fat beyond elbow & knees. Excessive body hair growth, hair fall , dark shade over lower half of face, acne , oily face skin, black skin over back of neck, inner thighs & under surface of breast. May have a family history of Diabetes, especially father or his family.This will not allow ovulation to occur at time & so you cannot get pregnant, till treated. It also increases your chances of early pregnancy abortions. But this has a solution.Your weight has to be Weight(in Kgs)= Height (in cms)-100Your expected weight is 53-58 kgs.Once you reduce weight to normal range, you won't need any medicine to get periods or to get pregnant & pregnancy will be healthy. To reduce weight -NO FASTING, No junk food/ fast foods/ red meat, reduce snacks in between mealsHave low calories food, high proteinsRegular exercise ( especially for the waist & hip area), aerobics , yoga, brisk walking( swing your hands well)   ,try to reduce 2-4 kgs / month. Don't hurry on weight reduction, it will be difficult to maintain. As soon as you reduce at least 5 kgs , you will see changes.When you take Primolut-N only your periods get altered , does not do any good or bad to your pregnancy chancesHope I have clarified your queries. do write back if any more queriesAll the best"},{"Patient":"hi i am wonering what is good for my skin care hi i am a 15 year old teen i care about my looks i have light skin color . im not white white looking butt not tan looking .. im in between more white than tan. i have brown eyes butt i HAVE to wear green contacts. what makeup is best for my skin? which make up helps to not break out? or helps you have a non soily skin? which eye shodow or eyeliner would help my eyes stand out? what kind of facials and lotions are good for my face care? how can have a healthy looking skin? please give me some good eauty tips thatll help me have a healthy nice face and all =) thank you","Doctor":"Welcome to Healthcare Magic You can use good facewash and try not to apply make up but you can apply sunscreen for protection from tanning and ill effects of UV rays.

Rupturing of follicles may take 34 to 36 hours after the injection.  So, you can do a scan after2 days. If not ruptured, you can take hcg shot again and repeat IUI. Discuss with your doctor regarding this.  The chance to get pregnant in one cycle of IUI is 10 to 15 percent.  So, you can get pregnant this cycle also. But if it doesn't work, then you can try IUI for 3 to 6 cycles.  Hope I have answered your question.

When follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 to 6 months.  Hope I have answered your question.

Cause of acne may be just a wrong selection of soap or a moisturizer to hormonal disturbances in body (esp in females). You have not mentioned your gender ,kindly do so because treatment depends upon that too. Treatment starts form the use of a anti acne face cleanser .It can be a anti acne soap or a face wash .Next would be use of a good anti acne cream for day time and night time use. Along with this one should be given a course of antibiotic tablet .This I would say is the basic or the first level treatment. If patient does not respond to this or one has very sever acne then comes use of oral retinoids.Retinoids are wonder drug for acne , but one needs to undergo various blood investigations before taking this .Also there are certain precautions which one needs to follow before use of this medicine.Your dermatologist would be the best judge for this .You should first get your pimples treated and then go for spots. For the spots left by pimples the best would be chemical peels (glycolic or salycilic acid) .Then there are creams like tretinoin cream which can be used in night over  the spots .In day time you should use a good sunscreen so that sun rays don't harm you or darken the spots. Along with this one has to drink plenty of water and take good 7 hr sleep in night. Avoid all cosmetic creams or moisturizers on face. Healthy life style with above treatment is a must to keep your face clean and acne free. So,i would advise you to consult a skin specialist(dermatologist) who can prescribe you medicines accordingly. regards, Dr.chawda"},{"Patient":"i have a number a red pimples that produce alot of puss. i have a number a red pimples that produce alot of puss. they burn and sting and they are situated on my legs toes feet pubic region and face im 17 male and have a history od psorisis","Doctor":"Hi!, Welcome to Healthcaremagic forum, You need to explain your problem in detail.Are these red lesions itchy too over legs.The lesions on the face and legs seems to be two different things .kindly clarify.

I was on the pill from when I was 15, I came off it Jan 2013 (I am 29 years old). I have a 29 day cycle. I started using the clearblue fertility monitor. One month I ovulate mid cycle, the next month is always very irregular. The first time I ovulated around day 17/18 of my cycle and this time the fertility monitor has shown high levels of estrogen from day 12 - till today day 19 and I still haven t peaked and ovulated. Is late ovulation a problem? Is there a way of regulating when I ovulate? Could this be why I am struggling to conceive? Thanks so much in advance for your help.","Doctor":"Hello Mam,                  I just read your query.* See normally ovulation occurs around 14th day of cycle. But it may vary, so women are adviced to conceive between 12-14 days of cycle. But the ovulation period may vary in every woman according to her hormones and cycle.* As you have mentioned about fertility monitor and you are keeping an eye on ovulation. But let me clear you one thing that along with ovulation, size of egg and rupture of egg is also important. Sometimes size is  mildly lesser than the normal size and sometimes egg is normal in size and ovulation occurs but egg did not rupture as a result one will be failed in conceiving.* So I advice you to start taking Tab. Folic acid(5mg) one tablet once a day. As it will help in proper growth of egg.*If you still want to give some more try without help of doctor then take this tablet daily for three months and keep on trying. * Other way is take this tablet and go for ovulation study in a nearby scan center as it will provide you the exact knowledge about your follicle and if somehow follicle does not rupture and you will come to know about this,then you can consult your gynecologist. She will recommend you one injection which help in rupturing and it would be easier for you to get conceived * Eat healthy and fresh food. Do exercise and walk daily as exercise and walk will help in increased pelvic blood flow as a result  better uterus health.* I know that you are completely concerned about your problem,but still go for general check up of your husband as well as for his semen analysis too. * All these factors will help you in solving your problem.* I hope you are satisfied with my answer.

Let me tell you that in women ovulation usually occurs on 14th day of their cycle i.e after commencement of periods 14th day of your cycle. So if you want to get pregnant try between 12th to 15th day of your cycle.* As far as the male partner is concerned rather than the quantity of semen quality matters. In quality the number of sperms, motility of sperm matters. This can only be known by semen analysis. If you want to know that then you can go to a nearby laboratory and ask for semen analysis and come to know about the condition.* So for getting conceived try between 12- 15th day of your cycle and after intercourse lie down for sometime and get up immediately and eat healthy food and both of you do exercise daily.* I hope you are satisfied with my answer.

One thing you have to know clearly that two areas ie. pubic area and axillary reg(underarm) are generally darker due to hyper pigmentation and coarse thick hair.It is quite normal & natural thing after puberty and it does n't depend on your fairness of other body parts. In 90-95% women,those area are darker. Here I give you some tips to reduce darkness of PUBIC AREA (Vagina): *Don't wear polyester or synthetic underwear.Use cotton underwear and always loose fitting. Regular (weekly basis) shaving of your pubic hair with hair removing cream. Occasional waxing may be needed. *Bleach the area with lemon/lime juice (Natural Bleacher) and leave it for 20 mins. Try shower to shower. Keep the area dry and clean all times.Use toilet paper after each bathroom work and after every bath, apply corn starch to the area to keep it dry. Avoid using talcum powder. * Your inner thighs rub together & this also causes darkness,you may need to lose weight on your thighs. Make a decoction of a teaspoon each of milk powder, honey, lemon/lime juice, and almond oil. Apply on the area and wash after 15 minutes. *Maintain a healthy diet and use only sanitary napkin during periods.Also maintain your personal hygiene,sleep timely and keep tension free. You have to continue above things for 3 to 6 months.Then you may get a good result. All the best."},{"Patient":"hi i have a dark spat on my knee how can i remove it thank u","Doctor":"Use Xerina cream 2-3 times daily on the dark areas. you may notice improvement after 6-8 weeks of therapy"},{"Patient":"I am 28 years old and I have had chin hair for several years now.

It is commonly assumed that dark circles under the eyes are caused by a lack of sleep, and poor quality sleep and insomnia can certainly cause this condition. However, a variety of other conditions can lead to dark circles under the eyes, some of which are related to lifestyle, such as drinking too much coffee or crying. Other causes are genetic or medically based, such as infection, head or facial trauma, or thin skin on the lower eyelids, which makes the underlying blue-colored veins more visible. Depending on the cause, dark circles under the eyes can arise suddenly and disappear quickly, such as when you have a mild allergic reaction to animal dander or dust. Dark circles under the eyes that develop over time may be a sign of chronic dehydration or anemia. Mild to moderate dark circles often respond well to simple and inexpensive treatments, such as: Cold. Try a cold compress, two chilled teaspoons or a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a soft cloth to temporarily reduce dilated and discolored under-eye blood vessels. Or try a cooled, used teabag. Extra pillows. Elevate your head with two or more pillows to prevent puffiness that develops when fluid pools in your lower eyelids. Extra sleep. Although short nights don't usually cause under-eye circles, a lack of sleep makes you paler and more hollow-eyed, so shadows and circles you already have are more obvious. Dark glasses and sunscreen. Although a tan might hide dark circles in the short term, in the long run, the extra pigment it produces can make circles worse. Saline washes or sprays. Rinsing your sinuses with a saltwater solution (mix 1/4 teaspoon sea salt with 2 cups warm water) or over-the-counter saline spray can help relieve nasal congestion. Cosmetics. Hundreds of skin creams that claim to reduce or prevent under-eye circles crowd department store and drugstore shelves. The results of one study showed that a serum containing plant-based compounds, including root extracts and Brazilian suma, significantly improved the appearance of dark under-eye circles. Camouflage. The right concealer can do just that — hide dark circles. If the circles under your eyes are bluish, use a peach-colored concealer, not one that's white or gray. And avoid scented products and those containing salicylic or glycolic acid, which can irritate delicate eye tissue, making redness and swelling worse. If it doesnt get better you must see a dermatologist. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"Hello, I am having dark circles under my eyes. I am taking healthy food.

In case of allergic condition one can apply tacrolimus cream locally along with a sunscreen. You can also try hydroquinone cream at night time. If nothing works then the last resort would be lasers.Specific laser for this would be Q-switched Nd:yag laser .But the results are variable and no doctor would promise you the results.

I have pains along myback at the wasteline and also at the edges of my abdomen. I tried getting pregnant this but unsuccessful. PLEASE ADVICE ME. Thank you","Doctor":"Hi, I think you can try naturally for 6 months to one year because myomectomy doesn't affect conception. But if it doesn't work in 6 months, get yourself evaluated.  Do a thyroid profile and prolactin levels and a ultrasound for your uterus and ovaries.  Also do a HSG to see the tubal patency.  A semen analysis of your husband should be done.  if everything is fine, you can try for 6 more months.  Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  IT will increase chances of your pregnancy.  Hope I have answered your question.

Once the patches are stable say for more than 6 months ,then you can go for surgery called BLISTER ROOF GRAFTING. This is a very specialized surgery where in a blister is created on the abdomen and this thin skin is grafted over the lips ,after dermabrassion of lip skin. This gives good result .You can see details in my web site www.skinhairclinic.com.(vitiligo section).

Now a days there are very good tablets available for pimples but should be taken under dermatologists supervision only.They can be either azithromycin or isotretinoin tab . Tab azithromycin (500mg) once daily for 3 days(take this tab 1 hr before food).Hormonal pimples can be treated with oral contraceptive pills .They are very effective and safe.All these needs blood test before taking them. For marks use retino A (0.025%) cream  at night only on the spot for 2 hrs then wash off . Donât forget to use a water based sunscreen like UVAVO daily full face so as to protect yourself from direct sunlight which ca increase your dark marks Along with this u need to take 10-12 glasses of water per day & a good sleep. .A chemical peel can also help reduce the marks .Get it done from an expert dermatologist only. regards, Dr.Chawda"},{"Patient":"what could a small rash that does not itch but spreads fast be?

On my left hand, one at a time, the skin on the backside of my knuckles (ring, middle, now pinky) have become hard, dry, itchy, and enlarged.  After about 10 days the thik skin begins to peel and I rip it away.  It remains dry and cracked for another week while healing. Possibly related: I was wearing a tungsten ring that probably had nickel in it; I was alergic to that ring (I'm guessing the nickel).  It effected the front of my ring finger and a little on my middle finger.  I stopped wearing that ring a few weaks ago, about a week before my 3rd finger became 'infected'.  The infection on the front of my fingers from the ring doesn't resemble to knuckle infection at all.","Doctor":"Hi try this simple treatment.Get potassium permanganate crystals.

Clindamycin phosphate is an antibiotic with activity against Propionibacterium acnes, the acne causing bacteria and is nicotinamide is anti-inflammatory in nature. Supatret has Tretinoin which is a topical retinoid and this regimen is effective for mild moderate acne. If you have more number of inflammatory lesions and pustules, an oral antibiotic like Azithromycin or Doxycycline can also be added. Side effects of Tretinoin include burning sensation, redness and dryness. You can apply a moisturizer to your treatment like Neutrogena oil free moisturizer or Acnemoist cream. If there is lot of irritation or dryness you can switch to Adapalene instead of Tretinoin (Supatret). Supatret helps in acne scars mildly. Best treatment option include lasers and peels for atrophic/depresssed scars and for post acne hyperpigmentation kojic acid or azelaic acid combinations.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards"},{"Patient":"im on the birth control patch and im supposed to change it every sunday but i waited and did put it on until wensday and that same day i had intercourse and my partner came inside me then 2 seconds after i got my period. is there a possiablity i could be pregnant ?","Doctor":"Hi, if you have got periods, you can't be pregnant.
