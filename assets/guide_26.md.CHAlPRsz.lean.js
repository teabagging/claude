Pleuritis(inflammation of lining of lungs), asthma, pneumonia, pneumothorax might be other causes.* Sometimes hyperacidity also causes pain in heart or heart burning, esophageal hypersensitivity or perforation might be other causes.* Sometimes common causes like muscle strain or rib problem due to excessive coughing or rib fracture due to injury might also cause pain in left side of chest.* These are the most common causes behind the chest pain on left side or heart pain as you said and these  can be ruled out by doctor after clinical examination. So visit a nearby physician to know the exact cause. If you require any investigation you will also come to know about that too.As once diagnose is made it would be easier for you to get treatment.* I hope you are satisfied with my answer.

So before getting it examined, you should not be jumping to conclusions.2. Cysts on the labia commonly due to infection of bartholin glands. This can be treated with removal and antibiotics. 3. If it is large, usually marsupialization is done so that the cyst does not recur.4. Since you are pregnant, it needs medical attention to avoid further infection and complications arising out of it.Hope this helpsRegards"},{"Patient":"I have a sore lump at the top of my nose in the corner of my eye so its more ornless we re my eye brow starts its very big and very sore I did have a ganglion on my hand its its not their eny more could this be the problem its causing me alo of hed pain ?","Doctor":"Hi ! Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. The sore lump on your nose could be an inflammatory lump giving rise to the pain and tenderness at that site.

Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Although it requires a personal physical examination of the lump to say what this could be, from your history it seems that this could be an organised hematoma (solidified blood clot) caused due to the trauma in case this appeared from the date of the trauma. If the swelling occurred later, it might be an independent entity, and could be benign swelling like a lipoma, or more probably a neurofibroma considering the hypersensitivity of the lump. If I were your doctor, after an initial clinical assessment I would advise you for a FNAC of the swelling to have a cytological diagnosis followed by the definitive treatment depending on its report. Till then, you could go for an anti inflammatory and a proton pump inhibitor drug for a symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I m a 46-year-old-female. I was diagnosed with heart palpitations a few years ago. I have had severe chest pain on the right side in front and in back. It is hard to swallow even water.

As you have difficulty in swelling, i doubt you could have a problem on your food pipe (esophagus).This could be serious & you should meet a gastroentrologist soon.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query. Although the lumps on your son's scalp and lower down need to be assessed clinically, from the history it seems that the lower lump could be an inflamed lymph node draining the area of the bug bite or ulcer created by the scratch by your son on his scalp. If I were your doctor, I would refer your son to a dermatologist to rule out any kind of skin problem in the scalp for which he scratched that site. After local treatment of the site, he may prescribe your son with a broad spectrum antibiotic and an anti inflammatory drug which would control the infection/inflammation on both sites and he would be relieved.

Lump in the inguinal area is often secondary to infection in the genital area. If you have any lesions on genitalia, do get it examined and treated accordingly.4. If there are no lesions elsewhere and groin ulcer is the sole problem then it is probably primary lesion in groin like necrotizing lesion which is causing ulcer.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, I after a proper clinical examination of your elbow and the chest, would apply a pressure bandage on the lump presuming that it could be a hematoma following the trauma which would gradually get absorbed. In addition, I would also prescribe you with an anti inflammatory and a proton pump inhibitor and a serratopeptidase product for a symptomatic relief. If the cough has lasted for over 10 days, this would be an indication of going for a x-ray chest PA view to rule out any gross pathology in the lungs.

Three if I am honest. 1, I have a lump on the side of my penis head which started out looking like a blister but after masterbating I think it popped and clear fluid and blod came out. its been 2 days since then and its not bled or pussed but it is still a hard lump. 2, My girlfriend and I went on a long weekend holiday and I think I bruised above the penis (the pubic area) which I am guessing could have caused the next problem. It has been over a week and I am still experiencing pain in this area. It did have swelling at first which seems to have gone down. 3, when my penis is erect, from the base of my shaft (on top of the penis) to about half length a nerve (I think) or large vein is quite prominent. I only noticed this today but it seems to be a knock on effect from the bruising above the penis since I had sex last night. I was wondering if I could have contracted something off of a toilet, but after researching I found it is near impossible. Neither of us have had another sexual partner and have only been with each other for the last 6 years so I am guessing STIs are ruled out. So I was wondering if you possibly knew what this all was?

Any idea?","Doctor":"hi! thanks for sharing your health concerns with HCM!If someone with patchy hair loss and scalp lump comes to me, I divide the disease into two parts:1. fungal infection causing scarring alopecia on the surface2. a sebaceous cyst or lymph node which is a lump under the skintherefore, for confirmation of the diagnoses, you need a microbiological test from the surface and an FNAC from the underlying lump; before going for therapy!Hope this answers your question.

You need to have a course of antibiotics in case of a lymph node for any head or neck infection. In case its not subsiding with antibiotics further investigation is needed.

So this is an issue that requires a lot of background info, so here we go. In January of 2013, I had a mysterious and large mass appear on the right side of my neck. There were two parts to the mass, one solid and one filled with pus. No known cause, but whenever I had a needle biopsy done there was nothing coming out of the solid half of the mass so there were never any conclusive results. I had a CT scan done and there was another mass found on the outside of my lungs, but this one was benign. ENT surgically removed the neck-mass and the mass in chest was overlooked due to benign status. So, fast forward to January of 2014, I had to get a follow-up CT scan on the chest mass, and when I got the results a month later I was told that it was now about half the size than it was a year sooner (Good news!). In April, two lumps appeared on the back of my neck, one on the back right side and the other on the back left side. Along with this, there was a bit of swelling on the outer side of my right arm. I was given some antibiotics and sent home. The two lumps on the back of my neck are still there and very solid, but never hurt. The swelling on my right arm has never gone away, and it sometimes has small bursts of pain but nothing to stop me from any regular activity. Finally, recently, there has been some swelling on the left side of my neck, but it isn t similar to the lump I had on the right side of my neck. This swelling seems like soft tissue. Any idea what this may be? During the multiple biopsies and tests the hospital I was with had ran, there were zero signs of tuberculosis and lymphoma. An infectious disease specialist said that it may have been kikuchi disease, but there were no tests to run for it so it was only a theory. I didn t think it would be kiuchi, because I had fit none of the symptoms. If you re able to help, I would truly appreciate it. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi, as per your history, Kikuchi-Fujimoto's disease is the best possibility in your case and biopsy is the confirmatory test in such cases! Sorry that sometimes all symptoms might not fit due to partial therapy! There is no other specific tests available; However, it could be some acute lympadenitis or toxoplasmosis also!Kikuchi's disease just needs NSAIDS group of drugs along with steroids for 2/3 weeks and it is self-resolving disease!So please take antibiotics and wait and revert back to us.wish you good health!"},{"Patient":"I woke up two days ago and my abdomen was very tender and it was hard to sit up.

So i sat up and looked at the area of my leg (upper ankle, lower calf). I was should to see a faint white discoloration on my leg it was very small a transparent but when I went to feel it there was some sort of lump beneath the skin. It extended on all sides a little past the discoloration. After looking at the bump I remembered a quick sharp pain maybe an hour or two before which I realized could have been some sort of bug bite. So I went online and looked at slide shows of many bug bites but none matched mine. It might be that the bite isnt apparent enough as many of the sites said it could take 4 to 5 hours for the bite to be truly visible. So I was wandering if you could help me. When I touch the lump I do feel pain but its not severe or really that bad. It hurts the worst when I press on the bone maybe less than a quarter inch away from it.

And when a doctor see a dangerous arrhythmia, he or she stops the tests before developing life-threatening arrhythmias. And in the worst case, even if they couldn't stop the test before it, all the exam rooms are equipped with necessary devices for resuscitation. So chances are extremely low with the bad outcome. And if the physician performing the test is experienced, I would advise you to undergo the test in that hospital, even if they have no cardiac surgery. Hope I have answered your query.

It is a physiological response.Other than that stress, anxiety and panic also send the heart rate shooting up.Only certain classes of blood pressure medicines e.g. beta blockers , control the heart rate, not all of them.You need better blood pressure control and a beta blocker if your not already on one.Also get your thyroid function checked since hyperthyroidism can also cause tachycardia."},{"Patient":"Uhm, I have a bump located on the back, lower area of my leg, that it firm to the touch and is very painful, even to walk with.

I noticed a hard lump on the lower part of the epididymis on my left testicle (essentially this is right at the point where the epididymis connects to the testicle and is at the bottom side). About the size of a pea, it was very hard. Upon some examination I felt some pain and discomfort. It appears this pain then radiated to my left buttock and groin, then the leg. It also felt like there was some pain inside my belly on that left side. I let a couple days go by and the lump seemed to shrink, but the pain on the legs became pretty bad. Best description of this is dullness. But since I couldn t locate the lump anymore I decided to try and ejaculate just to see whether it was a clogging or not. Upon doing this the lump on the left epididymis re-appeared! What s more right at this moment it felt as though my right testicle became instantly harder. Not rock solid but definitely harder. This reappearing lump was much smaller, just as hard, but on this occasion I took care when examining so no pain. The testicle can feel a bit tender, but there are no lumps on either testicle. I also just want to add that in recent months I ve started to visit the gents more often (well 4 times a day instead of 2/3). Indeed I am very scared, as I sincerely hope this is not cancer.

In fact, persons with coronary artery disease may have a normal resting ECG. And a better work-up to rule out a cardiac source of chest pain is to undergo stress testing - either stress Echo or just a plain treadmill ECG stress test, whichever is available. Considering that you have another risk factor for atherosclerosis which is your elevated cholesterol levels, it is noteworthy to check a cardiac cause rather than the lesser serious causes like gastrointestinal causes.

Familial Hypertension is quite common now  days and it usually affect young age group. Yes your Blood pressure is high and it needs to be managed. Your doctor has put you on a blood thinner and a combination of two anti hypertensive drugs. I personally don't think there's a need to start you on so many meds so it's advisable that you should personally consult a cardiologist and this regarding this issue.Things I would like to recommend you are1. Start going for daily morning walks 45 mins a day for 5 days a week.2. Low dietary salt intake.3. Avoid junk, canned and deep fried food items.4. Stop smoking completely  ( if you do ). 5. Include good amount of fruits and vegetables in your daily routine diet.6. Keep yourself stress free7. Avoid drinking too much of coffee or drinks that contains caffeine as it also increases bp.Follow this routine strictly for 3 months and hopefully you will not need anymore meds to lower your BP. All medicines do have their side effects on long term use.I wish you good health"},{"Patient":"I have two small lumps two the left of me knee, that I just discovered a week ago, don t have any pain from them but are both very prominent but feel they are getting bigger and noticed just tonight there s a bit of swelling between them,Just back from Holiday s trying to get appointment to go and see mt doctor.Any idea what this could be,","Doctor":"these could be benign tumor-like conditions like neurofibroma or lipoma; not to worry much!in worse case these could be hematoma due to injury or sebaceous cysts!all the best!"},{"Patient":"felt a movable mass above my left knee. would move in one direction whent flexed and another when extended. woke up one morning in incredible pain, unable to use leg, went to DR, passed out and taken to ER, all vitals are normal, 4 days later quad is stiff, still cant bend knee, on crutches","Doctor":"it is a bursa or ganglion-like cystic lesionneeds USG/FNAC test for confirmation and surgical excision is usually done for relief!all the best..........."},{"Patient":"Hi there, I have a lump underneath the skin in my calf, have been to see my gp and they said it seemed like a dvt.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Because of the pain it seems to be an inflammatory swelling and if I were your doctor, I would advise you not to fiddle with it at all, and advise you with an anti inflammatory drug along with a broad spectrum antibiotic and a proton pump inhibitor drug. This might subside the swelling and you might be cured, but in case it didn't, and increases in size, you might have to seek the opinion of a general surgeon who after a clinical examination might advise you with some invasive procedure in case of need.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Also it feals like simethinh is missing inside my outer hip area as compared to opposite hip. Is there anything to be cincerned about and should I seek medical attention?","Doctor":"Hi! Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.The swelling with the local bruising could be due to some amount of oozing of blood which got accumulated in the sub cutaneous tissue around the hip. However, the large lump might not be explainable simply by the oozing of blood. This could be due to accumulation of significant amount of blood or due to a dislocation of the hip ( in which case you might have limitation of the movements in hip joint). I would advise you to consult an orthopedic surgeon in your area for a clinical assessment and possible radiological investigations to rule out any bony injury.

If I were your doctor, I would first advise you not to poke on the lump as it would increase the chances of recurrent infections and might increase the lump. I would prescribe a broad spectrum antibiotic along with an anti inflammatory and a proton pump inhibitor drug which might heal the ulcer formed. An anti septic cream might also be added to it. Considering your poking the lump with a safety pin, I would also verify your immunisation status for tetanus, and give a shot of anti tetanus vaccine if needed.In case the lump goes on increasing, I would advise you to see a general surgeon in your area for a clinical assessment to rule out any other missed diagnosis/pathology in the lower lip.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I have one now that I don t think drained all the way a couple weeks ago and is a hard pea shape under skin in groin. I have had about 5 in my groin area or underneath my butt/thigh in 2 months that I have drained. Could this actually be cancer? Should I be really concerned?","Doctor":"Hi ! Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.All the swelling on the body might not be solely due to a cancer. So please do not be obsessive about it to avoid anxiety and stress. Well, you have to get these clinically assessed with related investigation by your family physician/ a general surgeon for an appropriate planned management.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

If the lump is hard and fixed that can be from bony origin. If it is mobile and soft it may be lipoma/fat lump. Lipoma does not require any treatment. X ray is required if it is bony origin.

Sometimes i feel a fast pulse in my lower  throat  after the sharp pain that happens in the middle of my chest .","Doctor":"Hi,Localized chest pain is rarely cardiac. But stabbing chest pain can be because of abnormality in integrity of aortic wall. Considering the dizzy spells, the possibilities of it is pretty high.So to rule it out, i will recommend you for a 2D Echo of the heart & aorta.If that is normal you can get a TMT done to rule out coronary disease as other possible cause.Come back if you need any more help.Thanks"},{"Patient":"My dog jumped on me play and scratch my arm.

Since you are active and doing weight lifting this may be joint effusion due to arthritis. Orthopedic surgeon opinion must be taken for this and if required, knee x ray.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Although it needs to be examined clinically to know the exact nature of the lumps, from your history, these seem to be either olecranon bursa (a benign cyst on the elbow due to chronic friction), or could be part of multiple lipomatosis, again a benign subcutaneous swellings mostly causing cosmetic problem as in your case. If I were your doctor, I would advise you to consult a general surgeon, who might advise you for a FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) of the lump. Further management would depend on the reports which could be an excision biopsy to be very sure of the cytological diagnosis by FNAC.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

It is red and hot to the touch.","Doctor":"Hi! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Even though a personal physical examination would confirm it, from your history this seems to be an inflamed sebaceous cyst not uncommon in the skin of the scrotum. If I were your doctor, I would advise you not to fiddle with it which caused the cyst to get infected and painful, prescribe you with a broad spectrum antibiotic, and an anti inflammatory with a proton pump inhibitor which should be able to control the infection and the pain symptomatically. Once the infection gets controlled, I would advise you to consult a general surgeon for a surgical removal (a minor operation under local anaesthetic) of the cyst for a complete cure and prevent recurrent infections. This should permanently solve the problem.However, if the infection does not get controlled at this stage, and an abscess forms, I would advise you for a simple incision and drainage , followed by a complete removal of the cyst at a later date when there won't be any infection.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I could not breathe and actually wondered if I was going to have a heart attack. I work full time and stand for 8 hrs a day so I'm not exactly a couch potatoe but get little exercise beside working. What are your thoughts","Doctor":"Hi There After reading your query I would like to tell you that working full time in routine is not considered as an exercise. You are active but you don't work out that the reason why your heart raced when you walked quite a length because it's not your routine and your body is not acclimatised to it.So my advise is to start a morning walk daily for 45 mins a day for 5 days a week. Avoid junk food and smoking ( if you do ),  eat lots of fruits and vegetables and you will be fine.I wish you good health"},{"Patient":"Hi, a few days ago I started having this pain and a tender spot on the very upper part of my back on the top part of the spine. Pain got worse and is now a lump with a bruise on it. Went to GP and she gave me pain meds and prednisone. X ray came back normal. What could this be? I don t recall being hit at this spot. I am a swimmer. Is a possible I overdid it and tore a muscle that is now bulging out???Thanks!!","Doctor":"HiWelcome to hcmYou must be having abscess (pus). Cause can be infected sebacious cyst or tubercular abscess in either case treatment is drainage of pus for which you have to see a surgeon. Antibiotics tablets only will not help.

Please help?","Doctor":"HiWelcome to hcmYou are having abscess/pus in butts which needs to be drained. It is not a simple boil. Treating yourself according to your net knowlage is very dangerous. Delaying treatment may cause sepsis and very deficult to treat. So show it to the surgeon as early as possible.Regards"},{"Patient":"I have had a little lump on the area where your earlobe meets your face/jaw I guess for a few months now and I just assumed it was an acne bump.

Im now fearful this could be an aneurysm,the lump is not red or secreting anything and its slightly hard. I just want to know is this a medical emergency or do I have time to create an appointment to speak to my gp?","Doctor":"HiWelcome to hcmThis is not an emergency at all but you should see your ENT surgeon and not gp.

ENT surgeon can examine and do needful.Regards"},{"Patient":"I have just had gastric sleeve ....2 weeks ago. I am doing very well now, but I noticed a lump on my ankle.

I have no fever and I feel fine. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HealthcareMagic.If you have developed the swelling after accident then that could be due to trauma leading to bleeding which stopped and formed a soft mass called haematoma.I suggest you to consult your doctor and confirm the diagnosis.

The first day I had a small grey bruise on my rear end that was tender to touch but otherwise not painful. A couple days later it was a but more sore so I checked it out. The bruise had turned a dark purple color and had grown substantially. Now the center of the bruise is white, pretty sore when I shift on it, and has a lump in the middle. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HealthcareMagic.Bruise changing colour is normal phenomenon. But developing lump indicates that you have developed haematoma. It is collection of blood. For this you need to take drugs like aceclofenac with serratiopeptidase and antibiotics like cefixime till the lump subsides.

Due to recent injury blood vessels have been ruptured and the blood appeared in the soft tissues. Such blood collection, if its large enough, can not be absorbed without medical help.That is why it should be checked by a general surgeon. Soft tissues ultrasound should be done at first.

There is no odor to the substance.","Doctor":"HiWelcome to hcmYou must be having some wound infection either due to irritation by belt or due to suture left behind partially.
