To prove the equation always has two real roots, we calculate the discriminant Delta as follows:[Delta = b^{2}-4ac = (-4m)^{2}-4cdot 1cdot 3m^{2} = 16m^{2}-12m^{2} = 4m^{2}.]Since 4m^{2} geqslant 0 for any real number m, it follows that Delta geqslant 0. This implies the quadratic equation always has two real roots, as the discriminant is non-negative.# Part 2: Finding the Value of m When the Difference Between Roots is 2## Method 1:Given the factored form of the equation left(x-mright)left(x-3mright)=0, we identify the roots as x_{1}=m and x_{2}=3m. With the condition that m > 0 and the difference between the roots is 2, we set up the equation:[3m - m = 2 implies 2m = 2 implies m = 1.]Thus, we find boxed{m=1} using Method 1.## Method 2:Let x_{1} and x_{2} be the roots of the equation. We know that x_{1}+x_{2}=4m and x_{1}x_{2}=3m^{2}. Given that x_{1}-x_{2}=2, we square both sides to eliminate the square root:[(x_{1}-x_{2})^{2} = 4 implies (x_{1}+x_{2})^{2} - 4x_{1}x_{2} = 4.]Substituting the known values, we get:[(4m)^{2} - 4cdot 3m^{2} = 4 implies 16m^{2} - 12m^{2} = 4 implies 4m^{2} = 4 implies m^{2} = 1.]Solving for m, we find m = pm 1.

By examining the initial terms of the Fibonacci sequence, we find a_{2}=1, a_{3}=2, and a_{4}=3. It is clear that a_{2}, a_{3}, and a_{4} form an arithmetic progression since 2-1=3-2=1. Therefore, statement ① is correct.Statement ②: We need to determine if there exists min N^{*} such that a_{m}, a_{m+1}, a_{m+2} form a geometric progression. Given the nature of the Fibonacci sequence, the set {a_{m}, a_{m+1}, a_{m+2}} can only be in the form of {odd, odd, even}, {odd, even, odd}, or {even, odd, odd}. This makes it impossible to satisfy the condition for a geometric progression, a^{2}_{m+1}=a_{m}a_{m+2}, for any min N^{*}. Thus, statement ② is incorrect.Statement ③: We are asked if there exists a constant t such that for any nin N^{*}, a_{n}, ta_{n+2}, a_{n+4} form an arithmetic progression. Using the Fibonacci sequence definition, we derive a_{n+4}=3a_{n+2}-a_{n}, which implies a_{n+4}+a_{n}=3a_{n+2}. This means a_{n}, frac{3}{2}a_{n+2}, a_{n+4} indeed form an arithmetic progression with t=frac{3}{2}. Therefore, statement ③ is correct.Statement ④: We need to verify if there exist positive integers i_{1}, i_{2}cdots i_{m}, with i_{1} lt i_{2} lt cdots  lt i_{m}, such that {a}_{{i}_{1}}+{a}_{{i}_{2}}+⋯+{a}_{{i}_{m}}=2023. By examining the sum of selected Fibonacci numbers, we find that 1+1+2+3+8+13+21+377+610+987=2023. This confirms that such a combination of indices exists, making statement ④ correct.In conclusion, the correct statements are ①, ③, and ④, making the total number of correct statements 3.Therefore, the answer is: boxed{C}."},{"problem":"Let i be the imaginary unit, and z = frac {2i}{1+i}.

Since natural numbers can be divided into 2 categories based on the remainder when divided by 2, i.e., remainders are: 0, 1, the difference between any two numbers in these categories can divide their sum, which does not meet the requirement; then consider 3, natural numbers can be divided into 3 categories based on the remainder when divided by 3, i.e., remainders are: 0, 1, 2, then further divide the remainders into two categories, 1 and 0 and 2, to derive the answer.【Solution】Clearly, natural numbers can be divided into 3 categories based on the remainder when divided by 3, i.e., remainders are: 0, 1, 2. All numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, the sum of any two such numbers leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, and their difference can be divided by 3, which meets the requirement. The same applies to all numbers that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, i.e., 2+2=4, 4 div 3 still leaves a remainder of 1. In the range from 1 to 1000, there are 334 numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, and 333 numbers that leave a remainder of 0, 2. Therefore, taking the 334 numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, these numbers meet the requirement; hence the answer is: 334."},{"problem":"3.

Claim:   We need to determine how many of the numbers:   [   a - frac{b}{c}, quad a - frac{c}{b}, quad b - frac{a}{c}, quad b - frac{c}{a}, quad c - frac{a}{b}, quad c - frac{b}{a}   ]   can be greater than 1.3. Example to Achieve 4:   Consider the specific values (b = c = frac{3}{2}) and (a = 2 + frac{4sqrt{2}}{3}). We need to check if these values satisfy the given condition and if they allow four of the expressions to be greater than 1.4. Assumption and Simplification:   Assume without loss of generality that (a geq b geq c). We analyze the case when (c geq 2):   - For (a = b = c = 2), all expressions are equal to 1.   - For (a > 2), the product ((sqrt{ab} - 1)(sqrt{ac} - 1)(sqrt{bc} - 1)) becomes greater than 1, which contradicts the given condition. Thus, (c < 2).5. Case Analysis:   - If (c leq 1), then (c - frac{b}{a}) and (c - frac{a}{b}) are both less than 1. Additionally, (b - frac{a}{c} leq b - a < 0), so at most three expressions can be greater than 1.   - If (1 < c < 2), we analyze further:     - (c - frac{a}{b} < 1), so at most five expressions can be greater than 1.6. Checking for 5 Expressions:   Suppose five expressions can be greater than 1. This implies:   - (c - frac{b}{a} > 1)   - (b - frac{a}{c} > 1)   - (a - frac{b}{c} > 1)   These yield:   [   bc > a + c quad text{and} quad ac > a + b   ]7. Further Implications:   - Since (b > 2) (otherwise (b - frac{a}{c} > 1) would yield a contradiction), we have (a > b > 2 > c).   - From (c - frac{b}{a} > 1), we get (ac > a + b).   - From (b - frac{a}{c} > 1), we get (bc > a + c).8. Contradiction:   Combining these, we get:   [   ac > a + b > 2sqrt{ab} quad text{and} quad bc > a + c > 2sqrt{ac}   ]   This implies:   [   abc^2 > 4asqrt{bc} quad text{or} quad bc^3 > 16   ]   Since (c^2 < 4), we get (bc > 4). Finally, (ab > ac > bc > 4), which contradicts the given condition ((sqrt{ab} - 1)(sqrt{bc} - 1)(sqrt{ca} - 1) = 1).9.

Find the largest n such that the sum of the fourth powers of any n prime numbers greater than 10 is divisible by n.","solution":"Answer: n=240.Solution. In fact, it is required that the fourth powers of all prime numbers greater than 10 give the same remainder when divided by n. Indeed, if the fourth powers of some two numbers give different remainders, then one can take n-1 of the first number and one of the second, then the sum of the fourth powers of these numbers will not be divisible by n.We will prove that the fourth power of any prime number p, greater than 10, when divided by 3, 5, and 16, gives a remainder of 1, then it will also give a remainder of 1 when divided by 3 cdot 5 cdot 16=240. We will use the fact that p^{4}-1=left(p^{2}-1right)left(p^{2}+1right)=(p-1)(p+1)left(p^{2}+1right).Since p is not divisible by three, either p-1 or p+1 is divisible by 3.Consider the remainders of p when divided by 5. If the remainder is 1, then p-1 is divisible by 5; if the remainder is 4, then p+1 is divisible by 5; and if the remainder is 2 or 3, then p^{2}+1 is divisible by 5.Since p is odd, each of the factors p-1, p+1, and p^{2}+1 is even. Moreover, one of the numbers p-1 or p+1 is divisible by 4, so the product of these three factors is divisible by 16.It remains to show that if a number is greater than 240, it does not satisfy the condition. Note that the difference of the fourth powers of any prime numbers greater than 10 must be divisible by n. First, take the prime numbers 13 and 11 and compute the difference of their fourth powers: 13^{4}-11^{4}=(13-11)(13+11)left(13^{2}+11^{2}right)=2 cdot 24 cdot 290=240 cdot 2 cdot 29. Now, take the numbers 17 and 11: 17^{4}-11^{4}=(17-11)(17+11)left(17^{2}+11^{2}right)=6 cdot 28 cdot 410=240 cdot 7 cdot 41. Since the GCD (240 cdot 2 cdot 29,240 cdot 7 cdot 41)=240, n cannot be greater than 240.Grading criteria.“+” A complete and well-reasoned solution is provided“土” A generally correct reasoning is provided, containing minor gaps or inaccuracies“-” The problem is not solved or solved incorrectly"},{"problem":"Two points, A and B, lie on two lines that form a 60^{circ} angle with each other.

Case ( n = 2 ):   - If ( n = 2 ), we need to subdivide the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles that are similar to the original and noncongruent to each other. This is impossible because if two rectangles are similar to the original and noncongruent, their aspect ratios must be the same as the original, which contradicts the requirement of noncongruence. Therefore, ( n = 2 ) is not possible.2. Case ( n ge 3 ):   - For ( n ge 3 ), we can construct a spiral of rectangles, each touching two of the previous rectangles in alternating orientations, except for the ( n )-th rectangle, which we orient in the same way as the ((n-1))-st rectangle. This construction ensures that all rectangles are pairwise noncongruent and similar to the original rectangle.3. Aspect Ratio Analysis:   - Let ( r > 1 ) be a real number to be determined. We need to ensure that the aspect ratio ( a(r) ) of the entire large rectangle matches ( r ).    - When ( r = 1 ), we have a golden spiral, and the aspect ratio ( a(1) ) is given by the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers, ( frac{F_{k+1}}{F_k} ), which is greater than 1.   - As ( r to infty ), the aspect ratio ( a(r) ) approaches a rational polynomial in ( r ), specifically ( left( frac{1}{2} + o(1) right) r ), which is less than ( r ).4. Intermediate Value Theorem:   - By the Intermediate Value Theorem, since ( a(1) > 1 ) and ( a(r) < r ) as ( r to infty ), there must exist some ( r ) such that ( a(r) = r ). This ensures that the constructed rectangles are similar to the original rectangle.Therefore, for ( n ge 3 ), it is possible to subdivide a rectangle into ( n ) pairwise noncongruent rectangles similar to the original rectangle.The final answer is ( boxed{ n ge 3 } )."},{"problem":"2.13.

Then the right prism whose base and top face are regular m-gons has exactly n=2m vertices and possesses m+2 < m+m=n faces. For even numbers n geq 6, such bodies therefore exist.If one places a four-sided pyramid with a corresponding base on one of the rectangular side faces of such a prism, the number of vertices of the new body increases to 2m+1 (the apex of the pyramid has been added) and the number of faces increases to (m+2)-1+4=m+5 (one face lies inside the new body as the base of the pyramid and thus disappears, while the pyramid adds 4 new faces), which for m geq 5 is still less than the number of vertices n=2m+1. Thus, such bodies also exist for odd n geq 11.For n=9, consider a right triangular frustum. This has 3 points each in the base and top face, a total of 6, and 3 additional faces besides the base and top, making a total of 5. If two congruent such frustums are glued together at their bases, the number of vertices of the new body increases to 6+3=9 and the number of faces increases to 5-1+3+1=8. Therefore, such a body also exists for n=9.For n=7, consider a regular pentagon ABCDE and the line segment PQ formed by shifting the height from A to the opposite side CD perpendicular to the plane of the pentagon.

Therefore, such a body also exists for n=7.Thus, N=6 can be chosen, as for every n geq 6 there exists a corresponding body with n vertices and fewer faces.However, N<6 cannot be chosen, as no such body with e:=n=5 vertices exists:Since at least 3 edges emanate from each of these vertices, the sum of these numbers must be at least 15. Since each edge is counted twice (it connects exactly two vertices), there must be at least k geq frac{15}{2}, and thus also k geq 8, edges in the body.Let f be the number of its faces. Then, according to Euler's polyhedron formula, e-k+f=2. With e=5 and k geq 8, it follows that f=2-e+f geq 2-5+8=5, so there can be no such body with 5 vertices but fewer than 5 faces.Thus, N=6 is indeed the smallest such value."},{"problem":"24.

Since (a) is a digit and we want the smallest such number, we can start by assuming (a = 1). This simplifies our problem to finding the smallest (n) such that:   [   frac{10^{n+1} - 1}{9} equiv 0 pmod{13}   ]   This is equivalent to:   [   10^{n+1} - 1 equiv 0 pmod{13}   ]   or   [   10^{n+1} equiv 1 pmod{13}   ]3.

Given a natural number x=9^{n}-1, where n is a natural number. It is known that x has exactly three distinct prime divisors, one of which is 11. Find x.","solution":"Answer: 59048.Solution. Since the number x is even, one of its prime divisors is 2. Therefore, we need to find all x that have exactly two odd prime divisors, one of which is 11. First, let's prove that the number 3^{s}+1 cannot be a power of two when s>1, and the number 3^{s}-1 cannot be a power of two when s>2. Indeed, for s>1, the number 3^{s}+1 is greater than 8 and is not divisible by 8, as its remainder when divided by 8 is 4 or 2. Now let s>2. If s is odd, the number 3^{s}-1 is greater than 8 and is not divisible by 8, as its remainder when divided by 8 is 2. If s=2k, then 3^{s}-1 is divisible by the number 3^{k}+1, which is not a power of two. From the above, it follows, in particular, that 9^{s}-1 will be a power of two only when s=1.The remainders of the powers of 9 when divided by 11 are 9, 4, 3, 5, 1 and then repeat cyclically. Therefore, the divisibility of x by 11 means that n is a multiple of 5, i.e., x=9^{5m}-1. If m=1, we get x=9^{5}-1=59048=2^{3} cdot 11^{2} cdot 61, which fits our criteria. Let's show that there are no solutions for m>1. Consider two cases.1) m is odd. By the formula for the sum of a geometric progression,x=p cdot q, quad text{where } p=9^{m}-1, quad q=1+9^{m}+9^{2m}+9^{3m}+9^{4m}Let's prove that the numbers p and q are coprime. Indeed, let the number r divide both p and q. Then5=q-(9^{m}-1)-(9^{2m}-1)-(9^{3m}-1)-(9^{4m}-1)Differences of the form 9^{km}-1 are divisible by p and, therefore, by r. Thus, r is a divisor of 5. But p is not divisible by 5 when m is odd, so r=1.Suppose p is divisible by 11. Then m vdots leq 5, i.e., m=5k. If k=1, then p is divisible by 11 and 61. For k>1, we can apply the same reasoning to p as to x. In both cases, p will decompose into two coprime factors that are not powers of two. Therefore, x has at least three different odd prime divisors, which is impossible.Now suppose q is divisible by 11. Note that p has an odd divisor, and q is odd and coprime with p. Then q must be a power of 11, i.e., q=11^{s}. But the remainder of 11^{s} when divided by 8 is 3 for odd s and 1 for even s, while the remainder of q when divided by 8 is 5. Therefore, the number q cannot be a power of 11.2) m is even. Then n=2k for k geq 5, andx=(9^{k}-1)(9^{k}+1)=(3^{k}-1)(3^{k}+1)(9^{k}+1)The factors on the right side are coprime, since the pairs of numbers 3^{k} pm 1 and 9^{k} pm 1 are odd and differ by 2. Moreover, none of the factors is a power of two. Indeed, we have already proven this for the first two, and 9^{k}+1 is greater than 8 and gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 8. Thus, x has at least three different odd prime divisors, which is impossible."},{"problem":"Let ABC be a triangle with sides 51, 52, 53. Let Omega denote the incircle of bigtriangleup ABC.

Define the problem in terms of graph theory:   - Let ( G ) be a graph where each vertex represents a person at the meeting.   - An edge between two vertices indicates that the corresponding people are familiar with each other.   - Each vertex has a degree of 22, meaning each person knows exactly 22 other people.2. Calculate the total number of edges:   - Since each of the ( n ) vertices has a degree of 22, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is ( 22n ).   - By the Handshaking Lemma, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is twice the number of edges.   - Therefore, the total number of edges ( E ) is given by:     [     2E = 22n implies E = frac{22n}{2} = 11n     ]3.

Firstly, we determine the total number of ways to select 2 bottles from the 30 available, which is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}. Here, we have C(30, 2) = frac{30!}{2!(30-2)!} = 435 total possible outcomes.The problem provides the probability of selecting 2 bottles that are both within the expiration date, which is frac {351}{435}. This event is complementary to the event of selecting at least 1 bottle that has expired.We calculate the probability of the complementary event by subtracting the provided probability from 1:P(text{at least 1 expired}) = 1 - P(text{both unexpired}) = 1 - frac{351}{435}Now, we simplify the probabilities:P(text{at least 1 expired}) = frac{435}{435} - frac{351}{435} = frac{435 - 351}{435}P(text{at least 1 expired}) = frac{84}{435}This fraction can be further simplified by identifying the greatest common divisor of 84 and 435, which is 3:P(text{at least 1 expired}) = frac{84 div 3}{435 div 3}P(text{at least 1 expired}) = frac{28}{145}Therefore, the probability of selecting at least 1 bottle that has passed its expiration date is boxed{frac{28}{145}}."},{"problem":"## Task 35/80We are looking for all four-digit natural numbers n with the following properties:1.

Given a natural number x=5^{n}-1, where n- is a natural number. It is known that x has exactly three distinct prime divisors, one of which is 11. Find x.","solution":"Answer: 3124.Solution. Since the number x is even, one of its prime divisors is 2. Therefore, we need to find all x that have exactly two odd prime divisors, one of which is 11. The remainders of the powers of 5 when divided by 11 are 5, 3, 4, 9, 1 and then repeat cyclically. Thus, the divisibility of x by 11 means that n is a multiple of 5, that is, x = 5^{5m} - 1. From here, using the formula for the sum of a geometric progression,x = p cdot q, quad text{where } p = 5^m - 1, quad q = 1 + 5^m + 5^{2m} + 5^{3m} + 5^{4m}Note that the numbers p and q are coprime. Indeed, let the number r divide both p and q. Then5 = q - (5^m - 1) - (5^{2m} - 1) - (5^{3m} - 1) - (5^{4m} - 1)Differences of the form 5^{km} - 1 are divisible by p and, therefore, by r. Thus, r is a divisor of 5. But p is not divisible by 5, hence r = 1.We will prove that the number p is a power of two only when m = 1. Indeed, let m > 1. If m = 2k, then write p = (5^k - 1)(5^k + 1). On the right side, we have the product of two consecutive even numbers. At least one of them is greater than 4 and does not divide by 4, so it is not a power of 2. Now let m = 2k + 1. Thenp = 5^m - 5 + 4 = 5 cdot (5^k - 1)(5^k + 1) + 4.The right side is not divisible by 8, since (5^k - 1)(5^k + 1) is divisible by 8 as the product of two consecutive even numbers. Since p > 4, the number p cannot be a power of two.When m = 1, we get x = 3124 = 4 cdot 11 cdot 71, which fits. We will show that there are no solutions when m > 1. One of the numbers p and q is divisible by 11. Consider two cases.1) p is divisible by 11. Then m vdots 5, that is, m = 5k. If k = 1, then p is divisible by 11 and 71. For k > 1, we can apply the same reasoning to p as to x. In both cases, p will decompose into two coprime factors that are not powers of two. Therefore, x has at least three different odd prime divisors, which is impossible.2) q is divisible by 11. Note that p has an odd divisor, and q is odd and coprime with p. Then q must be a power of 11. The remainder of 5^m when divided by 8 is 5 for odd m and 1 for even m. If m is odd, the remainder of q when divided by 8 is the same as that of 1 + 5 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 13, which is 5. For even m, the remainder of q when divided by 8 is also 5. But the remainders of 11^s when divided by 8 are only 3 and 1, so q cannot be a power of 11."},{"problem":"2.

Suppose a student ( s ) solved 5 questions, denoted by ( q_1, q_2, q_3, q_4, q_5 ). According to the problem, each question is solved by exactly 4 students. Therefore, there are 3 other students who solve each of ( q_1, q_2, q_3, q_4, q_5 ) besides ( s ).   Since ( s ) did not solve all the questions, there exists at least one question ( q_6 ) that ( s ) did not solve. Consider the pairs ( (q_6, q_i) ) for ( i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ). Each pair must be solved by exactly one student. However, ( q_6 ) is solved by exactly 4 students, and there are 5 pairs involving ( q_6 ). This implies that at least one pair ( (q_6, q_i) ) is not solved by any student, which is a contradiction. Therefore, a student can solve at most 4 questions.2.

Note that ( q ) is the only common question solved by ( s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4 ), otherwise there would be a pair of questions solved by more than one student, which contradicts the problem's conditions.   If ( p ) is a question other than ( q ), then ( p ) must be solved by at least one of ( s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4 ), otherwise no student would solve the pair of questions ( (q, p) ). Since each ( s_i ) can solve at most 4 questions, each ( s_i ) can solve at most 3 more questions other than ( q ).   Therefore, the maximum number of questions is:   [   1 + 3 times 4 = 13   ]3.

By moving the free tickets to the back of the hall, 150 * 40 = 6000 (CZK) would be earned, which does not match the problem statement.b) We assume that the segment with free tickets ends in the second fifth of the hall, i.e., that p < 150 leqq 2p. By moving the free tickets from the first fifth to the fifth, 40p CZK would be earned. In the second fifth of the hall, there are 150 - p free tickets, and their move to the fourth fifth would earn 20 cdot (150 - p) CZK. We calculate p:begin{aligned}40p + 20 cdot (150 - p) & = 4320 20p + 3000 & = 4320 p & = 66.end{aligned}We see that the assumed inequality 150 leqq 2p does not hold, so the segment with free tickets cannot end in the second fifth of the hall.c) We assume that the segment with free tickets ends in the third fifth of the hall, i.e., that 2p < 150 leqq 3p. By moving the free tickets from the first fifth to the fifth, 40p CZK would be earned, from the second fifth to the fourth, 20p CZK. The remaining 150 - 2p free tickets are in the third fifth of the hall and would be moved without profit back to the third fifth. We calculate p:begin{aligned}40p + 20p + 0 cdot (150 - 2p) & = 4320, 60p & = 4320, p & = 72.end{aligned}We see that the assumed inequality 2p < 150 leqq 3p holds. Therefore, the segment with free tickets could end in the third fifth of the hall, and the total number of seats in the hall would then be 5p = 5 cdot 72 = 360.d) We assume that the segment with free tickets ends in the fourth fifth of the hall, i.e., that 3p < 150 leqq 4p. We can set up an equation similarly to the previous paragraphs or use another approach: 180p CZK was earned from tickets in the fifth fifth of the hall, and 4p - 150 tickets were sold in the fourth fifth, earning 200 cdot (4p - 150) CZK. If the free tickets were distributed from the back rows, 5p - 150 tickets would be sold, all at 220 CZK. The difference between these two revenues is 4320 CZK, leading to the following equation:begin{aligned}220 cdot (5p - 150) - 180p - 200 cdot (4p - 150) & = 4320 120p - 3000 & = 4320, p & = 61.end{aligned}We see that the assumed inequality 3p < 150 does not hold, so the segment with free tickets cannot end in the fourth fifth of the hall.e) We assume that the segment with free tickets ended in the fifth fifth of the hall. We can proceed as in paragraphs b), c), and d) or use a simpler approach: money was earned only from seats in the fifth fifth, and if they were sold in the first fifth instead, 40 CZK more would be earned per ticket. The number of sold seats would then be 4320 : 40 = 108, and the total number of seats would be 150 + 108 = 258. However, the segment with 150 free tickets would not end in the last fifth of the hall, so the assumption at the beginning of this part of the solution cannot be fulfilled.There were 360 seats in the hall."},{"problem":"[b](i)[/b] Determine the smallest number of edges which a graph of  n nodes may have given that adding an arbitrary new edge would give rise to a 3-clique (3 nodes joined pairwise by edges).\\r[b](ii)[/b] Determine the smallest number of edges which a graph of  n nodes may have given that adding an arbitrary new edge would give rise to a 4-clique (4 nodes joined pairwise by edges).","solution":"(i) Determine the smallest number of edges which a graph of ( n ) nodes may have given that adding an arbitrary new edge would give rise to a 3-clique (3 nodes joined pairwise by edges).1.

Quadrilateral A B C D is a trapezoid with overline{A B} and overline{C D} as its bases because A B | C D.The area of the trapezoid is given by P=s v, where s=frac{a+b}{2}, and a and b are the lengths of the bases of the trapezoid.Thus, 80=s cdot 8, from which s=frac{a+b}{2}=10, so a+b=20.The right triangles triangle S M P and triangle S Q N have hypotenuses of length frac{s}{2}=5 mathrm{~cm}.Using the Pythagorean theorem, we calculate |M P|=4 mathrm{~cm} and |N Q|=3 mathrm{~cm}.Let E and F be the feet of the perpendiculars from vertices D and C to the bases, and Z be the foot of the perpendicular from vertex K to the base of triangle triangle A B K.Denote the lengths of segments overline{E Z} and overline{Z F} as l and m respectively, and the lengths of segments overline{A E} and overline{F B} as y and x respectively.By the AA similarity criterion, right triangles triangle S M P and triangle B C F are similar because |angle P M S|=|angle C B F| (angles between parallel lines).From this similarity, we have |S P|:|M P|=|C F|:|B F|, or 3: 4=8: x, so x=frac{32}{3}.Similarly, from the similarity of triangle N Q S and triangle A E D, we have |S Q|:|Q N|=|D E|:|A E|, or 4: 3=8: y, so y=6.Since quadrilateral C D E F is a rectangle (adjacent sides are perpendicular), |E F|=|C D|=b, sox+y=a-b.Solving the system a-b=frac{32}{3}+6, a+b=20, we get a=frac{55}{3}, b=frac{5}{3}.Triangles triangle A Z K and triangle A E D are similar by the AA similarity criterion, so the ratio v: 8=(6+l): 6 gives v=8+frac{4}{3} l.Triangles triangle Z B K and triangle F B C are similar by the AA similarity criterion, so the ratio v: 8=left(m+frac{32}{3}right): frac{32}{3} gives v=frac{3}{4} m+8.Since m+l=a-x-y, we have m+l=frac{55}{3}-6-frac{32}{3}=frac{5}{3}.Solving the system frac{3}{4} m+8=8+frac{4}{3} l, m+l=frac{5}{3}, we getl=frac{3}{5}, quad v=frac{44}{5}.The area of triangle triangle A B K isP=frac{a cdot v}{2}=frac{frac{55}{3} cdot frac{44}{5}}{2}=frac{242}{3} mathrm{~cm}^{2}."},{"problem":"Given two lines m and n, and two planes alpha and beta, consider the following three statements:1.

Define the centers and radii of the circles:   Let the centers of the circles omega_1 and omega_2 be O_1 and O_2 respectively. Given that the radii are 3 and 12, and the circles are externally tangent at point P, we can place O_1 at (0,0) and O_2 at (15,0) since the distance between the centers is the sum of the radii, 3 + 12 = 15.2.

Since the circles are externally tangent, the line ST is parallel to the line joining the centers O_1O_2. The distance from O_1 to the tangent line is 3 and from O_2 to the tangent line is 12. Using the right triangle properties, we can find the coordinates of S and T.   - The slope of the line O_1S is tan(theta) where theta is the angle formed by the radius and the tangent line.

Understanding the problem: We need to find the smallest possible sum of five nonnegative integers such that any two of them are relatively prime. Two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 1.2. Considering the smallest nonnegative integers: The smallest nonnegative integer is 0. However, 0 is not relatively prime with any other number except 1. This is because the gcd of 0 and any number (a) is (a), and the only number (a) such that (gcd(0, a) = 1) is (a = 1).3. Using 0 and 1: If we use 0 as one of the numbers, the other four numbers must be 1 to ensure that all pairs are relatively prime. This is because (gcd(0, 1) = 1) and (gcd(1, 1) = 1).4. Summing the numbers: The sum of the numbers in this case is (0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4).5. Verification: We need to verify that this is indeed the smallest possible sum.

Determine the least possible value of f(1998).","solution":"120 Solution Let f(1) = k. Then f(kt 2 ) = f(t) 2 and f(f(t)) = k 2 t. Also f(kt) 2 = 1·f(kt) 2 = f(k 3 t 2 ) = f(1 2 f(f(kt 2 ))) = k 2 f(kt 2 ) = k 2 f(t) 2 . Hence f(kt) = k f(t). By an easy induction k n f(t n+1 ) = f(t) n+1 . But this implies that k divides f(t). For suppose the highest power of a prime p dividing k is a > b, the highest power of p dividing f(t). Then a > b(1 + 1/n) for some integer n. But then na > (n + 1)b, so k n does not divide f(t) n+1 . Contradiction. Let g(t) = f(t)/k. Then f(t 2 f(s)) = f(t 2 kg(s)) = k f(t 2 g(s) = k 2 g(t 2 g(s)), whilst s f(t) 2 = k 2 s f(t) 2 . So g(t 2 g(s)) = s g(t) 2 . Hence g is also a function satisfying the conditions which evidently has smaller values than f (for k > 1). It also satisfies g(1) = 1. Since we want the smallest possible value of f(1998) we may restrict attention to functions f satisfying f(1) = 1. Thus we have f(f(t) = t and f(t 2 ) = f(t) 2 . Hence f(st) 2 = f(s 2 t 2 ) = f(s 2 f(f(t 2 ))) = f(s) 2 f(t 2 ) = f(s) 2 f(t) 2 . So f(st) = f(s) f(t). Suppose p is a prime and f(p) = m·n. Then f(m)f(n) = f(mn) = f(f(p)) = p, so one of f(m), f(n) = 1. But if f(m) = 1, then m = f(f(m)) = f(1) = 1. So f(p) is prime. If f(p) = q, then f(q) = p. Now we may define f arbitarily on the primes subject only to the conditions that each f(prime) is prime and that if f(p) = q, then f(q) = p. For suppose that s = p 1 a 1 ...p r a r and that f(p i ) = q i . If t has any additional prime factors not included in the q i , then we may add additional p's to the expression for s so that they are included (taking the additional a's to be zero). So suppose t = q 1 b 1 ...q r b r .Then t 2 f(s) = q 1 2b 1 +a 1 ...q r 2b r +a r and hence f(t 2 f(s) = p 1 2b 1 +a 1 ...p r 2b r +a r = s f(t) 2 . We want the minimum possible value of f(1998). Now 1998 = 2.3 3 .37, so we achieve the minimum value by taking f(2) = 3, f(3) = 2, f(37) = 5 (and f(37) = 5).

Select those positive integers for which exactly 1 or 2 of alpha_{1}, alpha_{2}, alpha_{3}, alpha_{4}, alpha_{5} are non-zero to form the set S. That is, S includes: 50 even numbers 2, 4, cdots, 100 but excluding 2 times 3 times 5, 2^{2} times 3 times 5, 2 times 3^{2} times 5, 2 times 3 times 7, 2^{2} times 3 times 7, 2 times 5 times 7, 2 times 3 times 11 (7 numbers); 17 odd multiples of 3: 3 times 1, 3 times 3, cdots, 3 times 33; 7 numbers with the smallest prime factor 5: 5 times 1, 5 times 5, 5 times 7, 5 times 11, 5 times 13, 5 times 17, 5 times 19; 4 numbers with the smallest prime factor 7: 7 times 1, 7 times 7, 7 times 11, 7 times 13; and the prime number 11. Clearly, |S| = (50 - 7) + 17 + 7 + 4 + 1 = 72. We prove that this constructed S meets the conditions.Condition (1) is obviously satisfied.For condition (2), for any two different elements a, b in S, the prime factors of [a, b] include at most 4 of the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11. Let the missing one be p, then p in S, and (p, a) leq (p, [a, b]) = 1, (p, b) leq (p, [a, b]) = 1. Thus, taking c = p works.For condition (3), when (a, b) = 1, take the smallest prime factor p of a and the smallest prime factor q of b. Clearly, p neq q, and p, q in {2, 3, 5, 7, 11}, so pq in S, and (pq, a) geq p > 1, (pq, b) geq q > 1. The fact that a and b are coprime ensures that pq is different from a and b, so taking c = pq works. When (a, b) = e > 1, take the smallest prime factor p of e and the smallest prime q that does not divide [a, b]. Clearly, p neq q, and p, q in {2, 3, 5, 7, 11}, so pq in S, and (pq, a) geq (p, a) = p > 1, (pq, b) geq (p, b) = p > 1. The fact that q does not divide [a, b] ensures that pq is different from a and b, so taking d = pq works.We now prove that for any set S satisfying the conditions, |S| leq 72.Clearly, 1 notin S; for any two primes p, q > 10, the smallest number not coprime with both p and q is pq, and pq > 100, so according to condition (3), at most one of the 21 primes in [10, 100]: 11, 13, ..., 89, 97 can be in S. Let the set of the remaining 78 positive integers not exceeding 100, excluding 1 and these 21 primes, be T. We prove that at least 7 numbers in T are not in S, thus |S| leq 78 - 7 + 1 = 72.Actually, if some prime p > 10 is in S, the smallest prime factor of each number in S can only be 2, 3, 5, 7, or p. Combining condition (2), we know: (i) If 7p in S, since 2 times 3 times 5, 2^2 times 3 times 5, 2 times 3^2 times 5 and 7p include all the smallest prime factors, by condition (2), 2 times 3 times 5, 2^2 times 3 times 5, 2 times 3^2 times 5 notin S. If 7p notin S, and 2 times 7p > 100, and p in S, then by condition (3), 7 times 1, 7 times 7, 7 times 11, 7 times 13 notin S. (ii) If 5p in S, then 2 times 3 times 7, 2^2 times 3 times 7 notin S. If 5p notin S, then 5 times 1, 5 times 5 notin S. (iii) 2 times 5 times 7 and 3p cannot both be in S. (iv) 2 times 3p and 5 times 7 cannot both be in S. (v) If 5p, 7p notin S, then 5 times 7 notin S. Thus, when p = 11 or 13, by (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), at least 3, 2, 1, 1 numbers in T are not in S, totaling 7. When p = 17 or 19, by (i), (ii), (iii), at least 4, 2, 1 numbers in T are not in S, totaling 7. When p > 20, by (i), (ii), (iii), at least 4, 2, 1 numbers in T are not in S, totaling 7. Therefore, the conclusion holds.When no prime p > 10 is in S, the smallest prime factor of each number in S can only be 2, 3, 5, 7.

The focus F of the parabola y^{2}=4x has coordinates (1,0) since the standard form of a parabola y^2 = 4ax gives us a focus at (a,0), and comparing it with the given equation, we find a=1.2. The directrix of this parabola is a vertical line opposite the focus, given by x=-a. Therefore, the equation of the directrix is x=-1.3. The asymptotes of the hyperbola frac{x^2}{a^2}-frac{y^2}{b^2}=1 are given by y=±frac{b}{a}x. These lines intersect the directrix of the parabola at points A and B.4. The coordinates of A and B can be found by substituting x=-1 into the equations of the asymptotes, yielding A(-1,frac{b}{a}) and B(-1,-frac{b}{a}).Given that triangle ABF is equilateral, we can use the property that the height of an equilateral triangle is frac{sqrt{3}}{2} times its side. The vertical distance between A and B is frac{2b}{a}, and since the triangle's height also corresponds to this distance, we have:[frac{2b}{a} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} times 2 implies frac{b}{a} = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}]Additionally, the relationship between the semi-major axis a, the semi-minor axis b, and the distance of the focus from the center c for a hyperbola is c^2 = a^2 + b^2. Since the focus of the hyperbola is also the focus of the parabola located at (1,0), we know that c=1.

By Vieta's formulas, we have:   [   a + b + c = 3,   ]   [   ab + bc + ca = -7,   ]   [   abc = 1.   ]2. Simplify the given expression:   We need to evaluate:   [   left( frac{1}{sqrt[3]{a} - sqrt[3]{b}} + frac{1}{sqrt[3]{b} - sqrt[3]{c}} + frac{1}{sqrt[3]{c} - sqrt[3]{a}} right)^2.   ]   Let (x = sqrt[3]{a}), (y = sqrt[3]{b}), and (z = sqrt[3]{c}). Then, the expression becomes:   [   left( frac{1}{x - y} + frac{1}{y - z} + frac{1}{z - x} right)^2.   ]3. Use symmetry and properties of roots:   Notice that:   [   frac{1}{x - y} + frac{1}{y - z} + frac{1}{z - x} = frac{(y - z) + (z - x) + (x - y)}{(x - y)(y - z)(z - x)} = 0,   ]   which simplifies to:   [   frac{0}{(x - y)(y - z)(z - x)} = 0.   ]   However, this approach does not directly help. Instead, consider the polynomial properties and the symmetry in the roots.4. Evaluate the product of differences:   The product of the differences of the cube roots can be related to the discriminant of the polynomial. For a cubic polynomial (x^3 + px + q = 0), the discriminant (Delta) is given by:   [   Delta = -4p^3 - 27q^2.   ]   For our polynomial (x^3 - 3x^2 - 7x - 1 = 0), we have (p = -7) and (q = -1). Thus:   [   Delta = -4(-7)^3 - 27(-1)^2 = -4(-343) - 27 = 1372 - 27 = 1345.   ]5. Relate the discriminant to the expression:   The discriminant (Delta) is related to the product of the differences of the roots:   [   Delta = (a - b)^2(b - c)^2(c - a)^2.   ]   Therefore:   [   (a - b)(b - c)(c - a) = sqrt{Delta} = sqrt{1345}.   ]6. Simplify the original expression:   Using the symmetry and the properties of the roots, we can simplify the original expression:   [   left( frac{1}{sqrt[3]{a} - sqrt[3]{b}} + frac{1}{sqrt[3]{b} - sqrt[3]{c}} + frac{1}{sqrt[3]{c} - sqrt[3]{a}} right)^2 = left( frac{1}{x - y} + frac{1}{y - z} + frac{1}{z - x} right)^2.   ]   Given the symmetry and the properties of the roots, this expression simplifies to:   [   left( frac{1}{x - y} + frac{1}{y - z} + frac{1}{z - x} right)^2 = left( frac{1}{sqrt[3]{a} - sqrt[3]{b}} + frac{1}{sqrt[3]{b} - sqrt[3]{c}} + frac{1}{sqrt[3]{c} - sqrt[3]{a}} right)^2 = frac{p sqrt[3]{q}}{r}.   ]7. Determine (p, q, r):   From the discriminant and the properties of the roots, we find:   [   left( frac{1}{sqrt[3]{a} - sqrt[3]{b}} + frac{1}{sqrt[3]{b} - sqrt[3]{c}} + frac{1}{sqrt[3]{c} - sqrt[3]{a}} right)^2 = frac{9 sqrt[3]{100}}{13}.   ]   Thus, (p = 9), (q = 100), and (r = 13).8.

Initial Assumptions and Definitions:   - We are given that there is a bijection between black and white numbers.   - The sum of three black numbers is black.   - The sum of three white numbers is white.2. Case Analysis:   - We start by assuming (1) is black. By induction, we will show that all odd numbers must be black.   - Suppose (1) is black. Then, (1 + 1 + k = k + 2) must be black for all odd (k). This implies that all odd numbers are black.3. Considering Even Numbers:   - Suppose there exists a black even number. By the well-ordering principle, let (m) be the smallest black even number.   - By induction, (1 + 1 + k = k + 2) must be black for all even (k ge m). This implies that all even numbers greater than or equal to (m) are black.   - Since (m) is the smallest black even number, all even numbers less than (m) must be white.4. Contradiction with Bijection:   - There are infinitely many odd numbers, hence infinitely many black numbers.   - If there are only finitely many white numbers (as there are only finitely many even numbers less than (m)), a bijection between black and white numbers cannot exist.   - Therefore, the assumption that there exists a black even number is false.

Let the number of teachers in Betsy's school be ( t ).From the problem, we can set up the following equations based on the given information:[ 4x - 15s = 23 ][ 5x - 23t = 15 ]4. We need to solve these equations to find the value of ( x ). First, we solve the second equation for ( t ):[ 5x - 23t = 15 ][ 23t = 5x - 15 ][ t = frac{5x - 15}{23} ]Since ( t ) must be an integer, ( 5x - 15 ) must be divisible by 23.

Prove that frac{a + b + c + d}{2} ge 1 +  sqrt{abcd} When does the equality hold?Leonard Giugiuc and Valmir B. Krasniqi","solution":"Given (a, b, c, d ge 0) such that (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4), we need to prove that [ frac{a + b + c + d}{2} ge 1 + sqrt{abcd} ]and determine when equality holds.1. Substitution and Simplification:   Let (a + b = m), (c + d = n), (ab = x), and (cd = y). The inequality becomes:   [ frac{m + n}{2} ge 1 + sqrt{xy} ]2. Convexity Argument:   Define the function:   [ f(x, y) = xy - left(frac{m + n - 2}{2}right) ]   We need to show that (f(x, y)) is convex in (x) and (y). The second partial derivatives are:   [ frac{partial^2 f(x, y)}{partial x^2} = 0 ]   [ frac{partial^2 f(x, y)}{partial y^2} = 0 ]   Since the second partial derivatives are zero, (f(x, y)) is linear in (x) and (y), and thus convex.3. Boundary Values:   Since (x = ab) and (y = cd), we have (0 le x le frac{m^2}{4}) and (0 le y le frac{n^2}{4}). By the properties of convex functions, the maximum value of (f(x, y)) occurs at the boundaries:   [ max f(x, y) = max f(alpha, beta) ]   where (alpha in {0, frac{m^2}{4}}) and (beta in {0, frac{n^2}{4}}).4. Case Analysis:   - Case 1: (x = frac{m^2}{4}) and (y = frac{n^2}{4}):     This implies (a = b) and (c = d). We need to prove:     [ a + c ge 1 + ac ]     given (a^2 + c^2 = 2). Squaring both sides:     [ (a + c)^2 ge (1 + ac)^2 ]     [ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 ge 1 + 2ac + a^2c^2 ]     Since (a^2 + c^2 = 2), we have:     [ 2 ge 1 + a^2c^2 ]     [ 1 ge a^2c^2 ]     [ (a^2 - 1)^2 ge 0 ]     which is always true.   - Case 2: (x = 0) and (y = 0) (i.e., (abcd = 0)):     This forces one of the variables to be zero. Assume (d = 0). We need to prove:     [ a + b + c ge 2 ]     given (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 4). Squaring both sides:     [ (a + b + c)^2 ge 4 ]     [ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) ge 4 ]     Since (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 4), we have:     [ 4 + 2(ab + bc + ca) ge 4 ]     [ 2(ab + bc + ca) ge 0 ]     which is always true.Thus, the inequality holds in both cases.Equality holds when (a = b = c = d = 1), as this satisfies (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4) and (frac{a + b + c + d}{2} = 1 + sqrt{abcd}).The final answer is (boxed{frac{a + b + c + d}{2} ge 1 + sqrt{abcd}})"},{"problem":"Example 1 Given x=frac{1}{2}left(1991^{frac{1}{n}}-1991^{-frac{1}{n}}right)(n is an integer).

Understanding the Geometry: We are given that SA bot plane ABC and AB bot BC. This information, along with the given lengths, suggests that we are dealing with a right-angled triangle ABC where AB and BC are perpendicular to each other, and SA is perpendicular to the plane ABC. This setup forms a right-angled triangular pyramid (tetrahedron) with S as the apex and ABC as the base.2. Finding the Radius of the Circumscribed Sphere: The radius of the circumscribed sphere of tetrahedron S-ABC can be found by considering the rectangular parallelepiped that circumscribes the tetrahedron. The diagonal of this parallelepiped, which passes through S and the midpoint of BC, serves as the diameter of the circumscribed sphere.3. Calculating the Diameter of the Sphere: Given SA = AB = 1 and BC = sqrt{2}, we can calculate the diameter (2R) of the sphere using the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions for the diagonal of the rectangular parallelepiped:   [   2R = sqrt{SA^2 + AB^2 + BC^2} = sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + (sqrt{2})^2} = sqrt{1 + 1 + 2} = sqrt{4} = 2.   ]4. Finding the Radius: From the diameter, we find that the radius R of the sphere is half of the diameter, which is R = frac{2}{2} = 1.5. Calculating the Surface Area of the Sphere: The surface area S of a sphere is given by the formula S = 4pi R^2. Substituting the value of R into this formula, we get:   [   S = 4pi (1)^2 = 4pi.   ]Therefore, the surface area of sphere O is boxed{4pi}."},{"problem":"10.

If the first step leads to something less than N-1 (probability (N-1) / N), then it leads to any of the integers {0,1, ldots, N-2} with equal probability.

So we have: -frac{a}{2} = -2 From this, we can solve for a: a = 4 Now we can write the function as: f(x) = x^2 + 4x + 5 The value of the function at the vertex (h = -2, k) is: f(-2) = (-2)^2 + 4 cdot (-2) + 5 = 1 The value of the function at x = 0 is: f(0) = 0^2 + 4 cdot 0 + 5 = 5 Since we know that the function attains its maximum value of 5 and minimum value of 1 on the closed interval [m, 0], and the vertex (minimum) of the parabola is at x = -2, the interval [m, 0] must include the vertex. Therefore, m must be less than or equal to -2. Additionally, m must be to the left of -4, since f(-4) = f(0) = 5 (by the function's symmetry), and we know the maximum value on [m, 0] is 5. Therefore, m cannot be less than -4. Combining these constraints, we get: -4 leq m leq -2 Thus, the range for m is boxed{-4 leq m leq -2}."},{"problem":"Given that the sequence {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence with a non-zero common difference d, and it is known that a_3 + a_9 = a_{10} - a_{8}, find the value of a_5.","solution":"Since {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence with non-zero common difference d, we havea_3 + a_9 = a_{10} - a_{8}.Using the formula for the n-th term of an arithmetic sequence, a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, we can write this asa_1 + 2d + a_1 + 8d = a_1 + 9d - (a_1 + 7d).Simplifying the right side of the equation gives usa_1 + 2d + a_1 + 8d = 2d.Combining like terms results in2a_1 + 10d = 2d.By subtracting 2d from both sides, we get2a_1 + 10d - 2d = 0 Rightarrow 2a_1 + 8d = 0.Dividing both sides by 2 yieldsa_1 + 4d = 0 Rightarrow a_1 = -4d.Since d neq 0, we can find a_5 by using its expression in terms of a_1:a_5 = a_1 + 4d = -4d + 4d = 0.Therefore, the value of a_5 is boxed{0}."},{"problem":"Given the universal set U={2, 4, 1-a}, and set A={2, a^2 - a + 2}, if complement_U A = {-1}, determine the value of a.","solution":"From the problem statement, we know that the elements of set A and its complement complement_U A are all contained within the universal set U.Let's go step by step:1.

Since from the rectangle T_1 T_2 S_2 S_1 it follows that |T_1 T_2| = |S_1 S_2| = 2r, substituting into the obvious equation c = |AT_1| + |T_1 T_2| + |BT_2| and considering |AD| + |BD| = c, we getc = |AD| cdot frac{r}{varrho} + 2r + |BD| cdot frac{r}{varrho} = 2r + (|AD| + |BD|) cdot frac{r}{varrho} = 2r + frac{cr}{varrho}.From this, the expression for the radius r isr = frac{c varrho}{c + 2 varrho}Substituting the known formula varrho = (a + b - c) / 2 and simplifying, we obtain the desired equation (1).Now assume that the lengths a, b, c, r are expressed as integers and let k = gcd(a, b, c). Then a = k a_1, b = k b_1, and c = k c_1, where due to the Pythagorean equality a_1^2 + b_1^2 = c_1^2, the numbers a_1, b_1, c_1 are pairwise coprime and the first two have different parities*.[^1]The third number c is thus odd, and therefore the number a_1 + b_1 - c_1 is even. Substituting a = k a_1, b = k b_1, and c = k c_1 into (1) and then canceling by k, we getr = frac{k c_1 (a_1 + b_1 - c_1)}{2 (a_1 + b_1)} = frac{k}{a_1 + b_1} cdot c_1 cdot frac{a_1 + b_1 - c_1}{2}.We will prove that not only the second, but also the first fraction on the right-hand side of (2) has an integer value. If some prime number p divides the odd number a_1 + b_1, then it cannot be that p mid c_1 (and thus left. p mid a_1 + b_1 - c_1 right), otherwise by the equality left( a_1 + b_1 right)^2 = c_1^2 + 2 a_1 b_1 it would follow that p mid a_1 b_1, which together with p mid a_1 + b_1 would mean p mid a_1 and p mid b_1, i.e., a contradiction with the coprimality of the numbers a_1, b_1. The number a_1 + b_1 is thus coprime with both c_1 and a_1 + b_1 - c_1, and therefore, due to the integrality of r, the first fraction in its expression (2) is also an integer.Only now will we add the assumption that r is a prime number. This is the product of three natural numbers according to (2). Considering c_1 > a_1 geq 1, it necessarily follows that c_1 = r and the two fractions on the right-hand side of (2) have the value 1. Thus, the equations k = a_1 + b_1 and a_1 + b_1 - c_1 = 2 hold, or k = a_1 + b_1 = c_1 + 2 = r + 2. From this, it follows that2 a_1 b_1 = (a_1 + b_1)^2 - c_1^2 = (r + 2)^2 - r^2 = 4r + 4.Dividing by two, we geta_1 b_1 = 2r + 2 = 2(a_1 + b_1 - 2) + 2 = 2a_1 + 2b_1 - 2.The last equation a_1 b_1 = 2a_1 + 2b_1 - 2 can be rewritten as (a_1 - 2)(b_1 - 2) = 2. From this, it easily follows that {a_1, b_1} = {3, 4}, and thus c_1 = r = a_1 + b_1 - 2 = 5 and k = r + 2 = 7. For the right-angled triangle with sides 7 cdot 3, 7 cdot 4, and 7 cdot 5, it indeed holds that r = 5. This proves the statement in the initial sentence of the solution.[^0]: * The value {t} is commonly referred to as the fractional part of the given real number t.[^1]: * The sum of the squares of two odd numbers is an even number that is not divisible by four, hence it is not a square."},{"problem":"The median to a 10 cm side of a triangle has length 9 cm and is perpendicular to a second median of the triangle.

Assume point (P) has coordinates ((-4+2cos alpha, 3+2sin alpha)). The minimum (|PQ|) will be reached when the line connecting (P) and (C_1) is perpendicular to the line (C_{2}), which has an equation of (x-y=4).When this is true, we have the slope of (PC_1) equal to (-1), as it is perpendicular to (C_{2}). Hence:[frac{3+2sin alpha - 3}{-4+2cos alpha - (-4)} = -1 implies sin alpha = - cos alpha]This gives us (alpha = frac{3pi}{4}) or (alpha = frac{7pi}{4}) after considering the domain (0 leqslant alpha < 2pi).For (alpha = frac{3pi}{4}), we get the point (P(-4-sqrt{2}, 3+sqrt{2})).For (alpha = frac{7pi}{4}), we get the point (P(-4+sqrt{2}, 3-sqrt{2})).Therefore, when (|PQ|) takes the minimum value, the coordinates of point (P) are (boxed{(-4+sqrt{2}, 3-sqrt{2})})."},{"problem":"Find all positive integers n such that there exists a prime number p, such that p^n-(p-1)^n is a power of 3.Note. A power of 3 is a number of the form 3^a where a is a positive integer.","solution":"To solve the problem, we need to find all positive integers ( n ) such that there exists a prime number ( p ) for which ( p^n - (p-1)^n ) is a power of 3. Let's go through the solution step-by-step.1. Initial Considerations:   - We are given that ( p^n - (p-1)^n ) is a power of 3, i.e., ( p^n - (p-1)^n = 3^a ) for some positive integer ( a ).   - Since ( 3^0 = 1 ) is not considered a power of 3, we have ( n > 1 ).2. Modulo 3 Analysis:   - Consider the expression modulo 3. If ( p equiv 0 pmod{3} ), then ( p ) is divisible by 3, which is not possible since ( p ) is a prime number.   - If ( p equiv 1 pmod{3} ), then ( p-1 equiv 0 pmod{3} ), making ( (p-1)^n equiv 0 pmod{3} ). Thus, ( p^n equiv 3^a pmod{3} ), which is not possible since ( p^n equiv 1 pmod{3} ) and ( 3^a equiv 0 pmod{3} ).   - Therefore, ( p equiv 2 pmod{3} ).3. Simplifying the Expression:   - Given ( p equiv 2 pmod{3} ), we have ( p-1 equiv 1 pmod{3} ).   - Thus, ( p^n equiv 2^n pmod{3} ) and ( (p-1)^n equiv 1^n equiv 1 pmod{3} ).   - Therefore, ( p^n - (p-1)^n equiv 2^n - 1 equiv 0 pmod{3} ), which implies ( 2^n equiv 1 pmod{3} ).4. Determining ( n ):   - The congruence ( 2^n equiv 1 pmod{3} ) holds if and only if ( n ) is even. Let ( n = 2k ).5. Further Analysis for ( n = 2k ):   - Consider ( n = 4m ) (i.e., ( n ) is a multiple of 4). We have:     [     p^4 - (p-1)^4 = (p^2 - (p-1)^2)(p^2 + (p-1)^2)     ]   - Simplifying, we get:     [     p^2 - (p-1)^2 = p^2 - (p^2 - 2p + 1) = 2p - 1     ]     [     p^2 + (p-1)^2 = p^2 + (p^2 - 2p + 1) = 2p^2 - 2p + 1     ]   - Since ( p equiv 2 pmod{3} ), we have:     [     p^2 equiv 4 equiv 1 pmod{3} quad text{and} quad (p-1)^2 equiv 1 pmod{3}     ]   - Thus, ( p^2 + (p-1)^2 equiv 1 + 1 equiv 2 pmod{3} ), which cannot be a power of 3.6. Conclusion for ( n = 2k ):   - Since ( n = 4m ) is not possible, we must have ( n = 2k ) where ( k ) is odd.   - If ( k > 1 ), then ( p^k - (p-1)^k ) must also be a power of 3, which is not possible by our previous analysis.   - Therefore, ( k = 1 ), and ( n = 2 ).7. Verification:   - For ( n = 2 ), we have:     [     p^2 - (p-1)^2 = p^2 - (p^2 - 2p + 1) = 2p - 1     ]   - We need ( 2p - 1 = 3^a ). For ( a = 1 ), we get ( 2p - 1 = 3 implies 2p = 4 implies p = 2 ), which is a prime number.   - For ( p = 2 ), we have ( 2^2 - 1^2 = 4 - 1 = 3 = 3^1 ), which is indeed a power of 3.Thus, the only solution is ( n = 2 ).The final answer is ( boxed{n = 2} )."},{"problem":"The minimum value of the function f(x)=2x^{2}-2ax+3 in the interval [-1,1] is denoted as g(a).(1) Find the expression for g(a);(2) Find the maximum value of g(a).","solution":"(1) The axis of symmetry of the function f(x) is x=frac{a}{2}.quadquad① When a  2, the axis of symmetry is x=frac{a}{2} > 1, thus g(a)=f(1)=2(1)^{2}-2a(1)+3=5-2a.In summary, g(a)=begin{cases} 2a+5, & a  2 end{cases}.(2) quadquad① When a  2, g(a) < 1.From ①, ②, and ③, we conclude that g(a)_{max}=boxed{3}."},{"problem":"1.

For any integer (m), the values of (a_n) change at the squares of integers. Specifically, (a_n = m) for (m^2 leq n < (m+1)^2).2. We need to find the sum ( sum_{k=1}^{1980} frac{1}{a_k} ).3. Observe that for each (m), the integer (a_n) remains constant for (2m+1) values of (n) (from (m^2) to ((m+1)^2 - 1)). However, since (a_n) is the closest integer to (sqrt{n}), we need to adjust the range slightly:   - For (n = m^2 + m), (a_n = m).   - For (n = m^2 + m + 1) to ((m+1)^2 + (m+1)), (a_n = m + 1).4. Therefore, for each (m), there are (2m + 2) terms where (a_n = m + 1).5. We need to find the largest (m) such that ((m+1)^2 + (m+1) leq 1980):   - Solving ((m+1)^2 + (m+1) = 1980) gives (m = 43).6.

First, let's consider the discriminant of a quadratic trinomial ( ax^2 + bx + c ). The discriminant ( D ) is given by:   [   D = b^2 - 4ac   ]4.

Notice that the discriminants are different:   [   D_f = 4 quad text{and} quad D_g = 64   ]7. Now, let's analyze the effect of the allowed operations on the discriminant. Consider the first operation:   [   f(x) rightarrow x^2 fleft(1 + frac{1}{x}right)   ]   Let ( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ). Then:   [   fleft(1 + frac{1}{x}right) = aleft(1 + frac{1}{x}right)^2 + bleft(1 + frac{1}{x}right) + c   ]   Simplifying:   [   fleft(1 + frac{1}{x}right) = aleft(1 + frac{2}{x} + frac{1}{x^2}right) + bleft(1 + frac{1}{x}right) + c   ]   [   = a + frac{2a}{x} + frac{a}{x^2} + b + frac{b}{x} + c   ]   [   = a + b + c + left(frac{2a + b}{x}right) + left(frac{a}{x^2}right)   ]   Multiplying by ( x^2 ):   [   x^2 fleft(1 + frac{1}{x}right) = a x^2 + (2a + b)x + (a + b + c)   ]8. The new quadratic trinomial is:   [   a x^2 + (2a + b)x + (a + b + c)   ]   The discriminant of this new trinomial is:   [   D' = (2a + b)^2 - 4a(a + b + c)   ]   Simplifying:   [   D' = 4a^2 + 4ab + b^2 - 4a^2 - 4ab - 4ac = b^2 - 4ac   ]   Thus, the discriminant remains invariant under this operation.9. Consider the second operation:   [   f(x) rightarrow (x-1)^2 fleft(frac{1}{x-1}right)   ]   Let ( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ).

The new quadratic trinomial is:    [    cx^2 + (b - 2c)x + (a - b + c)    ]    The discriminant of this new trinomial is:    [    D'' = (b - 2c)^2 - 4c(a - b + c)    ]    Simplifying:    [    D'' = b^2 - 4bc + 4c^2 - 4ac + 4bc - 4c^2 = b^2 - 4ac    ]    Thus, the discriminant remains invariant under this operation as well.11.

The equation of the tangent line l through point P is y= dfrac {1}{2}x_{0}x- dfrac {1}{4} x_{0}^{2}.  Setting y=0, we find x_{T}= dfrac {1}{2}x_{0}, hence T( dfrac {1}{2}x_{0},0).

In this case, overline{a b} can be chosen in 90 ways (as any number between 10 and 99).The difference can be 99 only if overline{a b}=99 and overline{e f}=00.Therefore, overline{a b} and overline{e f} can be chosen in a total of 90+1=91 ways.Now it remains to count the possible middle parts overline{c d} of the number overline{a b c d e f}.

Setting y=frac{t}{f(x)^{3}} we getf(x+t)=x^{3} fleft(frac{t}{f(x)^{3}}right)+f(x)for every x, t>0.From (1) it is immediate that f is increasing.Claim. f(1)=1Proof of Claim. Let c=f(1). If c<1, then taking x=1, t=1-c in (1) we getf(2-c)=f(1)=cwhich is a contradiction since f is increasing. If c>1, we claim thatfleft(1+c^{3}+cdots+c^{3 n}right)=(n+1) cfor every n in mathbb{N}. We proceed by induction, the case n=0 being trivial. The inductive step follows easily by taking x=1, t=c^{3}+c^{6}+cdots+c^{3(k+1)} in (1).Now taking x=1+c^{3}+cdots+c^{3 n-3}, t=c^{3 n} in (1) we get(n+1) c=fleft(1+c^{3}+cdots+c^{3 n}right)=left(1+c^{3}+cdots+c^{3 n-3}right)^{3} fleft(frac{c^{3 n}}{(c n)^{3}}right)+n cgivingfleft(frac{c^{3 n-3}}{n^{3}}right)=frac{c}{left(1+c^{3}+cdots+c^{3 n}right)^{3}}Since c>1, the right-hand side tends to 0 as n to infty, which contradicts the fact that f(x)>0 for every x>0.

Consider three transformations on this square: left(1right)L: counterclockwise rotation by 90^{circ}. left(2right)R: clockwise rotation by 90^{circ}. left(3right)S: reflection about the origin. The above three operations can transform the square into itself, but the positions of points A, B, C, D will change. For example, after applying transformation R to the original square, vertex A moves from (1,1) to (1,-1), and then after applying transformation S, A moves to (-1,1). Denote the sequence of k transformations on the original square as a_{1}a_{2}cdots a_{k}, where a_{i}in {L,R,S}, i=1,2,cdots,k. If after k transformations, the positions of the vertices return to their original locations, we call such a transformation a k-identity transformation. For example, RRS is a 3-identity transformation. There are _______ 3-identity transformations in total; for a positive integer n, there are _______ n-identity transformations in total.","solution":"To analyze the problem, we start by identifying the 3-identity transformations. Given the operations L, R, and S, we note that any 3-identity transformation must include S to ensure the vertices can return to their original positions. This results in the following possible combinations: LLS, LSL, SLL, RRS, RSR, and SRR. Therefore, there are boxed{6} 3-identity transformations.Next, we consider the general case for an n-identity transformation. We assign numerical values to the operations: L as 1, S as 2, and R as 3. The condition for an n-identity transformation is that the sum p+2q+3r (where p, q, and r are the counts of L, S, and R respectively) must be a multiple of 4. To find the number of n-identity transformations, we analyze the remainder when the sum p+2q+3r is divided by 4. Let a_{n}, b_{n}, c_{n}, and d_{n} represent the number of cases where the remainder is 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively, after n transformations. We derive the following relationships based on the possible outcomes of the nth transformation:- a_{n}=b_{n-1}+c_{n-1}+d_{n-1}- b_{n}=a_{n-1}+c_{n-1}+d_{n-1}- c_{n}=a_{n-1}+b_{n-1}+d_{n-1}- d_{n}=a_{n-1}+b_{n-1}+c_{n-1}Adding the last three equations, we obtain b_{n}+c_{n}+d_{n}=3a_{n-1}+2(b_{n-1}+c_{n-1}+d_{n-1}). Substituting into the first equation, we find that a_{n+1}=2a_{n}+3a_{n-1}, which simplifies to a_{n+1}+a_{n}=3(a_{n}+a_{n-1}). This indicates that {a_{n+1}+a_{n}} forms a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 3.Given that a_{3}=6 and a_{2}=3 (from the 2-identity transformations LR, RL, SS), we have a_{3}+a_{2}=9. Therefore, {a}_{n+1}+{a}_{n}=({a}_{3}+{a}_{2})times{3}^{n-2}=9times{3}^{n-2}={3}^{n}. Multiplying both sides by (-1)^{n+1} and applying the summing method, we derive {a}_{n}=frac{3cdot(-1)^{n}+{3}^{n}}{4}.Thus, the total number of 3-identity transformations is boxed{6}, and for a positive integer n, the total number of n-identity transformations is boxed{frac{3cdot(-1)^{n}+{3}^{n}}{4}}."},{"problem":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a} = (2, x) and overrightarrow{b} = (1, 2), if overrightarrow{a} parallel overrightarrow{b}, then the value of the real number x is (　　)A: 1  B: 2  C: 3  D: 4","solution":"Since overrightarrow{a} = (2, x) and overrightarrow{b} = (1, 2), and overrightarrow{a} parallel overrightarrow{b},  we can obtain x = 4.

From the sides of these faces, we will construct the triangle ABC on the paper, then the triangle ABD_1 congruent to ABD, and the triangle ACD_2 congruent to ACD, such that the latter two are connected to the first one along the common edges AB and AC, and all three triangles are the mirror images of the corresponding faces of the given tetrahedron (with opposite orientation, as we would see the faces from the inside, see Figure 1).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_4493c756a7f64913d899g-1.jpg?height=628&width=610&top_left_y=342&top_left_x=736)Let D' be the intersection of the perpendiculars dropped from D_1 to AB and from D_2 to AC.After cutting out the combined 3 faces, fold the ABD_1 face around AB as the axis above the base plane ABC, so D_1 passes above the line D_1D', as it traces an arc in the plane perpendicular to AB, and the projection of this entire plane onto the base plane is the drawn line D_1D'. Similarly, folding ACD_2 around AC, D_2 passes above the line D_2D', and D_1 and D_2 meet at the point D above D', since AD_1 = AD_2 = AD.Thus, in the original tetrahedron, D' is the projection of vertex D onto the base plane ABC, and DD' = m is the height of the body perpendicular to this base.Accordingly, if we determine the distance of D' from one of the vertices A, B, C, then m can be calculated from the triangles DD'A, DD'B, or DD'C. For example, from the first one,m^2 = DA^2 - D'A^2we choose this one, as in calculating D'A, we can advantageously use the observation that angle DAB = 90^circ, since DB^2 = DA^2 + AB^2.Thus, D_1D' passes through A, and if D_2' is the intersection of D_2D' and AC, and C' is the projection of C onto AB, then the triangles D'A D_2' and AC'C are similar right triangles, from whichD'A = AC frac{D_2'A}{C'C}For this, from the right triangles D_2D_2'A and D_2D_2'C,begin{gathered}D_2'D_2^2 = D_2A^2 - D_2'A^2 = D_2C^2 - D_2'C^2 = D_2C^2 - (AC - D_2'A)^2 D_2'A = frac{AC^2 + AD^2 - CD^2}{2AC} = frac{16}{7}end{gathered}With the same reasoning, from the right triangles CC'B and CC'A,begin{gathered}C'C^2 = BC^2 - C'B^2 = AC^2 - (BC' - AB)^2 BC' = frac{BC^2 + AB^2 - AC^2}{2AB} = 9, quad text{so} quad CC' = sqrt{40}end{gathered}Therefore, from (2) and (1),D'A = frac{8}{sqrt{10}}, quad m^2 = 64 - frac{64}{10} = frac{9 cdot 64}{10}, quad m = frac{24}{sqrt{10}}With CC' known, the area of the base triangle ABC can also be calculated, and thus the volume of the tetrahedron:V = frac{m}{3} cdot frac{AB cdot C'C}{2} = 48 text{ volume units, }(i.e., 48 units of a cube with unit edge length).Remarks. 1. The right angle of the ABD face can also be used by folding the faces ABC and ADC into the plane of this face (Figure 2).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_4493c756a7f64913d899g-2.jpg?height=789&width=681&top_left_y=126&top_left_x=711)Figure 2Based on the above, AC_1' = 3 units, similarly AC_2' = 2, C'A^2 = C_1'A^2 + C_2'A^2 = 13 and m_{ABD} = 6 units, the base area is 24 square units.2. The edge system of the tetrahedron under consideration is a good example of a so-called rational tetrahedron. A tetrahedron is called rational if all 6 edges and the volume are rational (in our case, integers). The sequential nature of the measurements reminds us of the 3, 4, 5 unit right triangle (the so-called Egyptian triangle). However, we note that the spatial arrangement of the edges is also important; by placing the opposite pairs of edges in a different way, the volume can be different. For example, by swapping the 6 and 8 unit edges, instead of the 6 unit height obtained in Remark 1, 6.97 is obtained, while the base area remains unchanged."},{"problem":"(10 (20 points) As shown in the figure, given a pyramid P-ABCD, the base ABCD is a rhombus, PA perp plane ABCD, angle ABC=60^{circ}, and E, F are the midpoints of BC, PC respectively.(1) Prove: AE perp PD;(2) If H is a moving point on PD, the maximum angle formed by EH with the plane PAD has a tangent value of frac{sqrt{6}}{2}, find the cosine value of the dihedral angle E-AF-C.","solution":"(10) (1) Since quadrilateral ABCD is a rhombus, angle ABC=60^{circ}, it follows that triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle.Since E is the midpoint of BC, AE perp BC.

For 1 leqslant k leqslant 14, only when k=3, frac{9 k+43}{12 k-1} is an integer. Therefore, the only possibility is that 36 people attended the meeting.

The problem states that there are two consecutive price reductions, and after these reductions, the price becomes 16 yuan per box. The average percentage reduction each time is represented by x. 1. First Reduction: The price after the first reduction can be calculated by taking the original price and subtracting the percentage reduction. Since the reduction is x (in percentage form), we multiply the original price by (1-x) to get the price after the first reduction. This gives us:   [   text{Price after first reduction} = 25 times (1-x)   ]2. Second Reduction: The price after the second reduction follows the same logic, but this time it is applied to the new price after the first reduction. Therefore, we multiply the price after the first reduction by (1-x) again. This results in:   [   text{Price after second reduction} = 25 times (1-x) times (1-x) = 25 times (1-x)^2   ]3. Formulating the Equation: Given that the price after the second reduction is 16 yuan, we can set up the equation to find the value of x that satisfies this condition.

Then any of the existing groups is again divided into two groups, and so on until each group consists of one coin. Each time a group is divided into two, the product of the number of coins in the two resulting groups is recorded. What can the sum of all recorded numbers be?","solution":"Answer: 300.Solution. First method. Let's represent the coins as points and connect each pair of points with a segment. We will get frac{25(25-1)}{2} =300 segments. With each division of one group of coins into two, we will erase all segments connecting points corresponding to coins that end up in different groups. Suppose at some step we divide the coins of one of the already existing groups into two groups of x and y coins. Then we erase x y segments. This is the number we record. Thus, the sum of the recorded numbers is the total number of erased segments. Since there were initially 300 segments, and in the end, all segments are erased, the total number of erased segments is 300.Second method. Consider the variable quantity S, equal at each moment to half the sum of the squares of the number of coins in the piles. Initially, S=frac{25^{2}}{2}=312.5, and at the very end, S=frac{1^{2}+1^{2}+ldots .+1^{2}}{2}=frac{25}{2}=12.5. If a pile with x+y coins is divided into two piles of x and y coins, then S decreases by frac{(x+y)^{2}}{2}- -frac{x^{2}+y^{2}}{2}=x y. Thus, with each division, the quantity S decreases by the next recorded number. Therefore, the sum of all recorded numbers is equal to the total decrease in the quantity S, which is 312.5 -12.5=300.Third method. We will prove by induction that if there are initially n coins, then the desired sum is frac{n(n-1)}{2}.Base of induction. For n=2, after the first step, we get two piles with one coin each and record the number 1 cdot 1=1. Since the equality frac{2(2-1)}{2}=1 is true, the statement is true for n=2.Induction step. Assume the statement is true for all n<k and prove that it is also true for n=k. Suppose on the first step k coins are divided into two groups of x and y coins ( k=x+y ). For x and y coins, the statement is true by the induction hypothesis.If in such a division x geqslant 2 and y geqslant 2, then the recorded sum isx y+frac{x(x-1)}{2}+frac{y(y-1)}{2}=frac{x^{2}-x+y^{2}-y+2 x y}{2}=frac{(x+y)^{2}-(x+y)}{2}=frac{k^{2}-k}{2}=frac{k(k-1)}{2}If, however, x=1 and y geqslant 2, then k=y+1 and the recorded sum in this case is 1 cdot y+frac{y(y-1)}{2}=frac{(y+1)^{2}-(y+1)}{2}= =frac{k(k-1)}{2}. According to the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is proven for any natural n geqslant 2. In particular, for 25 coins, we get: frac{25(25-1)}{2}=300.## Grading criteria:+ a complete and well-reasoned solution is providedpm the correct answer and a generally correct solution with minor inaccuracies or gaps is provided- only the answer is provided"},{"problem":"A square has side length s and a diagonal of length s+1.

Contradiction:   - Suppose ( f ) is not constant in ([n, n+1]). Then there exists ( c in (n, n+1) ) such that ( f'(c) = 0 ).   - By the second condition, ( f'(c) = 0 implies f(c) = 0 ).   - Therefore, ( f ) must be zero at all points where its derivative is zero, including all local extrema.7. Conclusion:   - Since ( f ) is zero at all local extrema and at the endpoints ( n ) and ( n+1 ), ( f ) must be zero throughout the interval ([n, n+1]).   - This argument holds for all ( n in mathbb{Z} ).8. Final Conclusion:   - Since ( f ) is zero on every interval ([n, n+1]) for all ( n in mathbb{Z} ), and these intervals cover the entire real line, ( f(x) = 0 ) for all ( x in mathbb{R} ).(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ f(x) = 0 } ) for all ( x in mathbb{R} )."},{"problem":"The radius of the circle obtained by the plane α intersecting the sphere O is  sqrt {2}, and the distance from the sphere center O to the plane α is 1.

Find the smallest possible perimeter. Solution","solution":": 77 = 16 + 28 + 33. Let the triangle be ABC with angle A obtuse and angle B = 2 angle C. Let the sides be a, b, c as usual. Note that a > b > c. We have b sin C = c sin 2C and c 2 = a 2 + b 2 - 2ab sin C. Hence, b/2c = sin 2C/sin C = cos C = (a 2 + b 2 - c 2 )/2ab. So ab 2 = a 2 c + b 2 c - c 3 . Hence b 2 (a - c) = c(a 2 - c 2 ). Dividing by a - c we get b 2 = c(a + c). Now the triangle with smallest perimeter will have a, b, c relatively prime (otherwise we could divide by the common factor). Hence c must be a square. For if c and a+c have a common factor, then so do a and c and hence a, b and c, which means they cannot be the minimal set. Clearly c is not 1 (or the triangle would have nil area). c = 4 gives a = 5, which is too short, or a ≥ 21, which is too long. c = 9 gives a = 7 (too short), 18 (3 divides a, b, c), or ≥ 40 (too long). c = 16 gives a = 20 (too short) or a = 33 which works. Larger c gives a larger perimeter. Eg c = 25 gives a = 56, b = 45 (perimeter 126). 20th USAMO 1991 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 11 May 2002"},{"problem":"Example 13.

Since the diagonals AC and BD of trapezium ABCD are perpendicular, the parallelogram EFGH becomes a rectangle.6. In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length. Therefore, the length of the segment FH (which connects the midpoints of the non-parallel sides AD and BC) is equal to the length of the midline EG.7.

Identify the given information: We are given that the total cost, y (in ten thousand yuan), of producing a certain product depends on the output, x (in units), through the relationship y = 3000 + 20x - 0.1x^2 and that 0 < x < 240, with x in mathbb{N}^{+}. Additionally, the selling price per unit is 25 thousand yuan.2. Set up the inequality: For the producer to not incur losses, the total sales revenue should be at least equal to the total cost. Given the selling price per unit is 25 thousand yuan, the total revenue can be represented as 25x. Thus, the inequality representing the condition for no losses is:   [25x geq 3000 + 20x - 0.1x^2]3.

For the seventh grade, since it forms a square array, the total number of students is the square of the number of students per side, which is [2(a+b)]^2.The difference in the number of students between the eighth and seventh grades is:begin{align*}& (3a+b)(2a+2b) - [2(a+b)]^2 &= 6a^2 + 8ab + 2b^2 - (4a^2 + 8ab + 4b^2) &= 6a^2 + 8ab + 2b^2 - 4a^2 - 8ab - 4b^2 &= 2a^2 - 2b^2.end{align*}Therefore, the difference in the number of students between the eighth grade and the seventh grade, in terms of a and b, is boxed{2a^2 - 2b^2}. Part 2: Specific Difference When a=10 and b=2Substituting a=10 and b=2 into our derived formula for the difference in the number of students, we get:begin{align*}2a^2 - 2b^2 &= 2 times 10^2 - 2 times 2^2 &= 2 times 100 - 2 times 4 &= 200 - 8 &= 192.end{align*}Therefore, when a=10 and b=2, the eighth grade has boxed{192} more students than the seventh grade."},{"problem":"Calculate the result of (-2)^{1999} + (-2)^{2000}.A: -2^{1999}  B: 2^{1999}  C: -2  D: 2","solution":"Solution: We have (-2)^{1999} + (-2)^{2000}  = (-2)^{1999} + 2 times (-2)^{1999}  = (-2)^{1999} (1 + 2)  = 2^{1999}.

Since alpha = frac{pi}{6}, the components of the direction vector will be cosleft(frac{pi}{6}right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} and sinleft(frac{pi}{6}right) = frac{1}{2}. Therefore, the parametric equations of line l are:begin{cases}x = -1 + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}t y = 2 + frac{1}{2}tend{cases}where t is the parameter.For curve C, the polar equation rho = 3 implies that the distance from the pole (origin) is constant at 3 for all values of theta. Converting this to the Cartesian equation using x = rhocos(theta) and y = rhosin(theta), we obtain x^2 + y^2 = 9.(Ⅱ) To find the intersection points of line l with curve C, we substitute the parametric equations of l into the Cartesian equation of C:[begin{align*}&left(-1 + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}tright)^2 + left(2 + frac{1}{2}tright)^2 = 9&t^2 + (2 - sqrt{3})t - 4 = 0end{align*}]Let t_1 and t_2 be the roots of this quadratic equation. Then, by Viète's formulas, we have t_1t_2 = -4.Since the parameter t corresponds to the length along line l from point P, the product of distances from point P to points M and N on curve C is given by the absolute value of the product of the roots t_1 and t_2:|PM| cdot |PN| = |t_1t_2| = 4Thus, |PM| cdot |PN| = boxed{4}."},{"problem":"17 cdot 3 If alpha, beta, gamma are the three interior angles of a triangle, and x=alpha+beta, y=beta+gamma, z=gamma+alpha.

Since the coefficients of x^{2} and y^{2} are the same (both are alpha+beta), if this is not 0, then the equation is either the equation of a circle or a point (the third possibility would be the empty set, e.g., x^{2}+y^{2}+1=0, but we know that our figure contains P).If alpha+beta=0, then rearranging equation (1) gives x=0. Thus, the points on the y-axis are not on any circle whose equation is of the form (2).If alpha+beta neq 0, then the figure defined by (1) (a circle or a point) is symmetric with respect to the x-axis, because if the coordinates of point Qleft(x_{1}, y_{1}right) satisfy (1), then the coordinates of point Q^{prime}left(x_{1},-y_{1}right) also do. Therefore, if our figure consists of a single point, that point lies on the x-axis. If alpha=0 (and thus beta neq 0), then (1) is the equation of a circle. If we are looking for points, we can assume that alpha neq 0, and thus that alpha=1 (we can multiply our equation by frac{1}{alpha}). Rearranging the equation:(1+beta) x^{2}+(1+beta) y^{2}+(4 beta-4) x+3 beta+3=0This will be the equation of a point on the x-axis if and only if, after substituting y=0, the resulting quadratic equation in x has a double root, i.e., if its discriminant is 0. This gives us:(4 beta-4)^{2}-4(1+beta)(3 beta+3)=0which simplifies to beta=7 pm 4 sqrt{3}. Substituting this back into (3) gives x= pm sqrt{3}. Therefore, the points with coordinates ( pm sqrt{3}, 0) do not lie on any circle whose equation is of the form (1).In summary, the points on the line x=0 and the points ( pm sqrt{3}, 0) satisfy the conditions of the problem.Remark. The equation in the problem represents a figure associated with a pencil of circles (for more on pencils of circles, see e.g., Hajós György: Bevezetés a geometriába, 40.8). Since the circles corresponding to the pairs alpha=1, beta=0 and alpha=0, beta=1 are disjoint, the pencil is elliptic, meaning no two distinct elements of the pencil intersect, and among the elements of the pencil, there are circles, a line, and two points. The line is the axis of symmetry of the pencil (figure).Based on the work of Béky Bence (Fazekas M. Főv. Gyak.

The reason for this error is that the mixed fraction was not correctly converted to an improper fraction before simplifying. This is a common mistake when dealing with square roots and fractions together. It's crucial to always convert mixed numbers to improper fractions to simplify correctly.Task 2: Correct Calculation ProcessLet's correct the calculation step by step:1. Start with the original expression and expand the square:   [   ({sqrt{2}+1})^2 - sqrt{4frac{1}{2}} = 2 + 2sqrt{2} + 1 - sqrt{9/2}   ]   This step correctly expands the square and converts the mixed number into an improper fraction.2. Simplify the expression:   [   = 3 + 2sqrt{2} - sqrt{9/2}   ]   Here, we combine the like terms (2 + 1) and leave the square root terms as they are.3. Further simplify the square root:   [   = 3 + 2sqrt{2} - frac{3sqrt{2}}{2}   ]   We recognize that sqrt{9/2} simplifies to frac{3sqrt{2}}{2} by simplifying inside the square root.4. Combine like terms:   [   = 3 + frac{4sqrt{2}}{2} - frac{3sqrt{2}}{2}   ]   Here, we express 2sqrt{2} as frac{4sqrt{2}}{2} to combine it with the other square root term.5. Final simplification:   [   = 3 + frac{sqrt{2}}{2}   ]   We subtract the square root terms and combine them with the constant term.Thus, the correct calculation process leads us to the final answer:[boxed{3 + frac{sqrt{2}}{2}}]Task 3: Advice on Operating with Square RootsWhen dealing with square roots, especially when they involve fractions or mixed numbers, it is crucial to convert mixed fractions to improper fractions before simplifying.

Use the Power of a Point theorem:   - Let x be the distance from K to the point where the line through K and O intersects omega_2.   - By the Power of a Point theorem, we have:     [     4^2 = x(x + 12)     ]   - Solving for x:     [     16 = x^2 + 12x     ]     [     x^2 + 12x - 16 = 0     ]   - Using the quadratic formula x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}:     [     x = frac{-12 pm sqrt{144 + 64}}{2}     ]     [     x = frac{-12 pm sqrt{208}}{2}     ]     [     x = frac{-12 pm 4sqrt{13}}{2}     ]     [     x = -6 pm 2sqrt{13}     ]   - Since x must be positive, we take:     [     x = 2sqrt{13} - 6     ]4. Calculate the distance between the centers K and O:   - The distance d is:     [     d = 2sqrt{13}     ]5. Verify the right angle condition:   - We need to check if angle KWO is a right angle.   - Using the Pythagorean theorem:     [     4^2 + 6^2 = (2sqrt{13})^2     ]     [     16 + 36 = 52     ]     [     52 = 52     ]   - Therefore, angle KWO is indeed a right angle.6. Calculate the length of overline{WU}:   - Since angle KWO is a right angle, triangle KWO is a right triangle with hypotenuse KO = 2sqrt{13}.   - The length of overline{WU} is the diameter of the circle formed by the intersection points W and U.   - Using the formula for the length of the chord in a circle:     [     text{Length of } overline{WU} = 2 times frac{4 times 6}{2sqrt{13}}     ]     [     text{Length of } overline{WU} = frac{24}{sqrt{13}}     ]     [     text{Length of } overline{WU} = frac{24sqrt{13}}{13}     ]The final answer is boxed{frac{24sqrt{13}}{13}}."},{"problem":"For the correlation coefficient r, which of the following descriptions is correct?A: If two variables are related, then r gt 0.B: If two variables are unrelated, then r lt 0.C: The smaller the value of r, the weaker the linear relationship between the two variables.D: The closer |r| is to 1, the stronger the linear relationship between the two variables.","solution":"To analyze the given statements about the correlation coefficient r, we must understand what r represents in statistics:1.

The two outer slices contain 4 K + K^{2} strips, while the others (inner slices) contain 4 K strips. Each \\"vertical slice\\" can be cut into K vertical columns. These columns can be divided into three groups: corner columns, marked with S on their top, edge-center columns, marked with E; and inner columns, marked with B. An E-marked column has K more strips than a B-marked one, and an S-marked column has K more strips than an E-marked one. Then, the cake is divided among the K people such that each person gets one \\"vertical slice,\\" and the two who get the outer slices exchange their K-2 E-marked columns for B-marked ones with those who received inner slices, ensuring that two columns are exchanged in each inner slice. The exchange is possible because with K geq 4, there are K-2 inner slices, and each inner slice has at least two B-marked columns. After the exchanges, each person will have 6 K strips. Indeed, for the two outer slices, the number of strips decreases by K(K-2), while for the inner slices, it increases by 2 K.If K=2, cutting the cake into 8 small cubes ensures that each person gets 4 identical pieces. The case K=3 is also easily solvable.Since 1997 is prime, and as we established, K must be a divisor of N, in the case K=1997, the cake must be cut into at least 1997^{3} pieces.Tamás Birkner (Budapest, Deutsche Schule, 5th grade)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_9f30a844912a27437061g-1.jpg?height=421&width=469&top_left_y=993&top_left_x=817)"},{"problem":"Given the universal set U={1,2,3,4}, set A={1,2}, and set B={2,3}, find (∁_UA)∪B= ______.","solution":"We have the universal set U={1,2,3,4}, set A={1,2}, and set B={2,3}.1.

Determine the largest n such that we can always pick some of the 5 chosen numbers so that they can be made into two groups whose numbers have the same sum (a group may contain only one number).","solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the largest ( n ) such that any five numbers chosen from the set ({1, 2, ldots, n}) can always be partitioned into two groups with equal sums.1. Understanding the Pigeonhole Principle:   The Pigeonhole Principle states that if ( n ) items are put into ( m ) containers, with ( n > m ), then at least one container must contain more than one item. We will use this principle to show that for ( n leq 15 ), any five numbers chosen from ({1, 2, ldots, n}) can always be partitioned into two groups with equal sums.2. Sum of Subsets:   Consider the set ({1, 2, ldots, n}). The number of subsets of any set of size ( n ) is ( 2^n ). For any subset of size 5, there are ( 2^5 = 32 ) possible subsets (including the empty subset). However, we are interested in non-empty subsets, so there are ( 2^5 - 1 = 31 ) non-empty subsets.3. Possible Sums:   The maximum sum of any subset of 5 numbers from ({1, 2, ldots, n}) is achieved by the subset ({n-4, n-3, n-2, n-1, n}). For ( n = 15 ), this subset is ({11, 12, 13, 14, 15}), and the sum is ( 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 = 65 ). Therefore, the possible sums of subsets of 5 numbers from ({1, 2, ldots, 15}) range from 1 to 65.4. Applying the Pigeonhole Principle:   Since there are 31 non-empty subsets and the possible sums range from 1 to 65, by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least two subsets with the same sum if we choose 5 numbers from ({1, 2, ldots, 15}). This means that for ( n leq 15 ), we can always find two subsets with the same sum.5. Counterexample for ( n geq 16 ):   Consider the set ({1, 2, 4, 8, 16}). The sums of all non-empty subsets are distinct: ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 ). Therefore, for ( n geq 16 ), it is possible to choose 5 numbers such that no two subsets have the same sum.Conclusion:Thus, the largest ( n ) such that any five numbers chosen from ({1, 2, ldots, n}) can always be partitioned into two groups with equal sums is ( n = 15 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 15 } )."},{"problem":"The contrapositive of the proposition \\"If ab = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0\\" is (　　)  A: If ab neq 0, then a neq 0 or b neq 0  B: If a neq 0 or b neq 0, then ab neq 0  C: If ab neq 0, then a neq 0 and b neq 0  D: If a neq 0 and b neq 0, then ab neq 0","solution":"Since the contrapositive of the proposition \\"If ab = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0\\" is sought, the negation of ab = 0 is ab neq 0, and the negation of a = 0 or b = 0 is a neq 0 and b neq 0.

The game gets finished when somebody cannot move.Find the maximal positive K such that, regardless of the strategy of Queenie, Horst can put at least K knights on the board.","solution":"Answer: K=20^{2} / 4=100. In case of a 4 N times 4 M board, the answer is K=4 N M.Solution. We show two strategies, one for Horst to place at least 100 knights, and another strategy for Queenie that prevents Horst from putting more than 100 knights on the board.A strategy for Horst: Put knights only on black squares, until all black squares get occupied.Colour the squares of the board black and white in the usual way, such that the white and black squares alternate, and let Horst put his knights on black squares as long as it is possible. Two knights on squares of the same colour never attack each other. The number of black squares is 20^{2} / 2=200. The two players occupy the squares in turn, so Horst will surely find empty black squares in his first 100 steps.A strategy for Queenie: Group the squares into cycles of length 4, and after each step of Horst, occupy the opposite square in the same cycle.Consider the squares of the board as vertices of a graph; let two squares be connected if two knights on those squares would attack each other. Notice that in a 4 times 4 board the squares can be grouped into 4 cycles of length 4, as shown in Figure 1. Divide the board into parts of size 4 times 4, and perform the same grouping in every part; this way we arrange the 400 squares of the board into 100 cycles (Figure 2).The strategy of Queenie can be as follows: Whenever Horst puts a new knight to a certain square A, which is part of some cycle A-B-C-D-A, let Queenie put her queen on the opposite square C in that cycle (Figure 3). From this point, Horst cannot put any knight on A or C because those squares are already occupied, neither on B or D because those squares are attacked by the knight standing on A. Hence, Horst can put at most one knight on each cycle, that is at most 100 knights in total.Comment 1. Queenie's strategy can be prescribed by a simple rule: divide the board into 4 times 4 parts; whenever Horst puts a knight in a part P, Queenie reflects that square about the centre of P and puts her queen on the reflected square.Comment 2. The result remains the same if Queenie moves first. In the first turn, she may put her first queen arbitrarily. Later, if she has to put her next queen on a square that already contains a queen, she may move arbitrarily again."},{"problem":"2.

What is the maximum number of parts that n circles can divide a sphere into?","solution":"15.27. Let the required number be denoted by S_{n}. It is clear that S_{1} = 2. Now, let's express S_{n+1} in terms of S_{n}. Consider a set of n+1 circles on a sphere and single out one of these circles. Let the remaining circles divide the sphere into s_{n} parts (s_{n} leqslant S_{n}), and let the number of parts into which they divide the singled-out circle be k. Since k is equal to the number of intersection points of the singled-out circle with the other n circles, and any two circles have no more than two intersection points, then k leqslant 2 n. Each of the parts into which the singled-out circle is divided splits no more than one of the previously obtained parts of the sphere into two parts. Therefore, the n+1 circles divide the sphere into no more than s_{n} + k leqslant S_{n} + 2 n parts, and equality is achieved when any two circles have two common points and no three circles pass through the same point.

This is the simplest case.To find the maximum value of n, we can start from the simple case n=3 and gradually increase the number of points, so we can consider the case of n=4.Starting from the simple case, we first consider a three-point set {A, B, C}, where triangle A B C is an equilateral triangle.Since n=4, if every three points form the vertices of an equilateral triangle, there will be C_{4}^{3} = 4 equilateral triangles.How do we construct the first equilateral triangle?A natural idea is to find three points in M that form the largest equilateral triangle. This way, the 4th point will be controlled within the range of this largest equilateral triangle. This strategy focuses on extreme cases, i.e., considering the two points in the point set M that are farthest apart.Assume M is a point set with at least 4 points, and every three points can form the vertices of an equilateral triangle.Since the finite point set M has at least 4 points, there must be two points with the maximum distance. Let the distance between point A and point B be the maximum.By the problem's condition, there exists a point C such that triangle A B C is an equilateral triangle.Draw arcs with A, B, C as centers and A B as the radius, forming a curved triangle A B C.Since A B = B C = C A is the maximum distance between any two points in M, the distance between any other point in M and A, B, C will not exceed A B, so all points in M are within or on the boundary of the curved triangle A B C.Assume the set M has another point P different from A, B, C. We consider the position of point P.(1) If point P is inside or on the boundary of triangle A B C.At this time, by the problem's condition, every three points in M form the vertices of an equilateral triangle, so for points A, P, there is a third point P_{1} such that triangle A P P_{1} is an equilateral triangle.Since angle B A P leqslant 60^{circ}, point P_{1} cannot be inside triangle A B C but can only be inside or on the boundary of a certain segment of the arc.Similarly, for points C and P_{1}, there must be a third point P_{2} such that triangle C P_{1} P_{2} is an equilateral triangle.If point P_{2} is on the same side of line C P_{1} as point A, consider triangle C P_{2} A and triangle C P_{1} B. Sincebegin{array}{c}C P_{2} = C P_{1}, C A = C B, angle P_{2} C A = angle P_{1} C B = 60^{circ} - angle A C P_{1},end{array}thentriangle C P_{2} A cong triangle C P_{1} B.Thus,angle P_{2} A C = angle P_{1} B C = angle P_{1} B A + 60^{circ} > 60^{circ}.At this time, P_{2} is outside the curved triangle A B C, soP_{2} B > A B.This means that the distance between point P_{2} and B in the point set M is greater than the distance between A and B, which contradicts the fact that A and B are the points with the maximum distance in M.If point P_{2} is on the same side of line C P_{1} as point B, the same contradiction can be derived.This shows that in the point set M, a fourth point P different from A, B, C cannot appear inside or on the boundary of triangle A B C.(2) If point P is inside or on the boundary of a certain segment of the arc, at this time, point P is equivalent to point P_{1} in (1). In this case, using point P and the point corresponding to the arc segment where point P is located as two vertices to form an equilateral triangle, by the proof in (1), point P_{1} will be outside the curved triangle, leading to a contradiction.Therefore, point P will not appear inside or on the boundary of a certain segment of the arc.From the above argument, we can conclude that the maximum number of points in the point set M we are looking for is 3."},{"problem":"Example mathbf{4} Find all pairs of positive integers (m, n), satisfying left(2 m^{2}+n^{2}right) mid(3 m n+3 m).(2012, Slovenia National Team Selection Exam)","solution":"From the problem, we set3 m n+3 m=kleft(2 m^{2}+n^{2}right)(k in mathbf{Z}).Then 3 m(n+1)=kleft(2 m^{2}+n^{2}right) geqslant 2 sqrt{2} k m.Thus, k leqslant frac{3(n+1)}{2 sqrt{2} n}=frac{3}{2 sqrt{2}}left(1+frac{1}{n}right) leqslant frac{3}{sqrt{2}}.From this, we get k leqslant 2.Considering 3 m n+3 m=kleft(2 m^{2}+n^{2}right) as a quadratic equation in n,k n^{2}-3 m n+2 k m-3 m=0.Thus, Delta=9 m^{2}-8 k^{2} m^{2}+12 k m.If k=2, then Delta=24 m-23 m^{2}.By Delta geqslant 0, we get m=1.From equation (1), we get n=1.If k=1, then the discriminant is a non-negative integer t squared, i.e.,begin{array}{l}t^{2}=Delta=m^{2}+12 m=(m+6)^{2}-36 Rightarrow 36=(m+6+t)(m+6-t) .end{array}Since t geqslant 0, m>0, we havem+6+t>0 text {. }Thus, m+6-t>0.Clearly, m+6+t and m+6-t have the same parity.Hence, m+6+t=m+6-t=6or m+6+t=18, m+6-t=2.In the second case, we getm=4, t=8 text {. }Therefore, equation (1) has solutions n=2,10.In summary, the positive integer pairs (m, n) that satisfy the problem's requirements are (1,1),(4,2),(4,10)."},{"problem":"Given a=3^{0.8}, b=0.8^{3}, c=log_{3}0.8, then the relationship among a, b, and c is ( )A: aa>bC: a>c>bD: a>b>c","solution":"Since a=3^{0.8}>3^1=1,  and 0b>c.

We need to determine the smallest number ( n ) such that no matter how we select ( n ) real numbers from the interval ([1, 2013]), we can always find a scalene polygon with sides equal to some of these numbers. 2. A scalene polygon is a polygon with all sides of different lengths. For a set of numbers to form a polygon, they must satisfy the triangle inequality: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.3. Consider the set of numbers ( {1, 1 + epsilon, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024} ), where ( epsilon ) is a very small positive number. This set contains 12 numbers. Notice that for any three numbers in this set, the sum of the two smaller numbers is always less than or equal to the largest number. Therefore, these 12 numbers cannot form a scalene polygon.4. Now, we need to show that if we select 13 numbers from the interval ([1, 2013]), we can always find a subset that forms a scalene polygon. Assume we have 13 numbers ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{13} ) in increasing order.5. Define ( S_i = a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, 12 ). We claim that ( S_i > a_{i+1} ) for some ( i ). Suppose not, then ( S_i leq a_{i+1} ) for all ( i ).6. This implies:   [   a_1 < a_2   ]   [   a_1 + a_2 < a_3   ]   [   a_1 + a_2 + a_3 < a_4   ]   and so on, up to:   [   a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_{12} < a_{13}   ]7. If we sum these inequalities, we get:   [   (a_1) + (a_1 + a_2) + (a_1 + a_2 + a_3) + ldots + (a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_{12}) < a_2 + a_3 + ldots + a_{13}   ]8. Simplifying the left-hand side, we have:   [   12a_1 + 11a_2 + 10a_3 + ldots + 1a_{12} < a_2 + a_3 + ldots + a_{13}   ]9. Rearranging terms, we get:   [   12a_1 + 10a_2 + 8a_3 + ldots + 2a_{12} < a_{13}   ]10. Since ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{13} ) are all in the interval ([1, 2013]), the above inequality implies that ( a_{13} ) must be extremely large, which is not possible because ( a_{13} leq 2013 ).11. Therefore, our assumption that ( S_i leq a_{i+1} ) for all ( i ) must be false. Hence, there exists some ( i ) such that ( S_i > a_{i+1} ).12. This means that we can always find three numbers among any 13 numbers in the interval ([1, 2013]) that satisfy the triangle inequality and form a scalene polygon.Conclusion:[boxed{13}]"},{"problem":"3.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the maximum number of elements in a set ( B ) such that for any two distinct elements ( a ) and ( b ) in ( B ), the difference ( a - b ) does not divide the sum ( a + b ).2. Initial Observations:   - If ( a ) and ( b ) are two elements in ( B ), then ( a neq b ).   - We need to ensure that ( (a - b) not| (a + b) ).3. Considering Differences:   - If ( a ) and ( b ) are consecutive integers, say ( a = k ) and ( b = k+1 ), then ( a - b = -1 ) and ( a + b = 2k + 1 ). Clearly, (-1) divides ( 2k + 1 ), so we cannot have consecutive integers in ( B ).   - If ( a ) and ( b ) differ by 2, say ( a = k ) and ( b = k+2 ), then ( a - b = -2 ) and ( a + b = 2k + 2 ). Clearly, (-2) divides ( 2k + 2 ), so we cannot have integers differing by 2 in ( B ).4. Finding an Upper Bound:   - To avoid differences of 1 or 2, we can consider numbers that are congruent to the same residue modulo 3.   - Let’s choose numbers that are ( 1 mod 3 ). These numbers are of the form ( 3k + 1 ).5. Constructing the Set:   - The numbers ( 1, 4, 7, 10, ldots ) are all ( 1 mod 3 ).   - The maximum number of such numbers in the range ( 1, 2, ldots, n ) is given by ( leftlceil frac{n}{3} rightrceil ).6.

Line charts, on the other hand, are more appropriate for showing trends. Therefore, statement A is incorrect because it misidentifies the type of chart that is best for reflecting trends.Option B: When investigating the service life of a certain model of electronic product, a comprehensive investigation would ideally include all units produced. However, in practice, this is often done through sampling due to practical constraints. Thus, statement B is incorrect because it overlooks the practical methodology of sampling.Option C: The probability of winning a game being frac{1}{5} means that on average, one win is expected out of every five games played. However, probability does not guarantee outcomes in a specific number of trials. The outcome of each game is independent, and it's possible to play 5 times without winning. Therefore, statement C is incorrect because it misunderstands the nature of probability and independence of events.Option D: The stability of a set of data can be inferred from its variance. A lower variance indicates that the data points tend to be closer to the mean, suggesting greater stability. Given that Group A has a variance of S_{A}^{2}=0.2 and Group B has a variance of S_{B}^{2}=0.03, Group B is indeed more stable than Group A because its variance is lower.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the largest odd positive integer ( n ) such that every odd integer ( k ) with ( 1 < k < n ) and (gcd(k, n) = 1) is a prime number.2. Using Bonse's Inequality:   Bonse's second inequality states that for ( m geq 5 ), the product of the first ( m ) primes is greater than the cube of the ((m+1))-th prime:   [   p_1 p_2 p_3 cdots p_m > p_{m+1}^3   ]   For our purposes, we can use a slightly weaker form:   [   p_2 p_3 cdots p_m > frac{1}{2} p_{m+1}^3 > p_{m+1}^2   ]   This can be shown using Bertrand's postulate, which states that there is always a prime ( p ) such that ( p < 2p_m ) for any prime ( p_m ).3. Calculating the Product of Primes:   Let's calculate the product of the first few primes:   [   p_2 p_3 p_4 p_5 = 3 cdot 5 cdot 7 cdot 11 = 1155   ]   Compare this with ( p_6^2 ):   [   p_6 = 13 quad text{and} quad p_6^2 = 169   ]   Clearly,   [   1155 > 169   ]   This confirms that for ( m = 5 ), the inequality holds.4. Induction Step:   Assume ( p_2 p_3 cdots p_m > p_{m+1}^2 ) for some ( m geq 5 ). Then,   [   p_2 p_3 cdots p_m p_{m+1} > p_{m+1}^2 cdot p_{m+1} = p_{m+1}^3   ]   By Bertrand's postulate,   [   p_{m+1} < 2p_m implies p_{m+1}^3 < (2p_m)^2 = 4p_m^2   ]   Thus,   [   p_2 p_3 cdots p_m p_{m+1} > 4p_m^2 > p_{m+2}^2   ]   This completes the induction step.5. Back to the Problem:   For any odd prime ( p ) with ( p^2 < n ), we must have ( p mid n ). Otherwise, (gcd(p^2, n) = 1) and ( p^2 ) is not a prime. Let ( p_m ) be the largest odd prime such that ( p_m^2 < n ) and ( p_m mid n ). Then,   [   p_3 p_4 cdots p_m mid n implies p_3 p_4 cdots p_m leq n   ]   By the result above, for ( m geq 5 ),   [   n geq p_3 p_4 cdots p_m > p_{m+1}^2   ]   This implies (gcd(p_{m+1}^2, n) = 1), but ( p_{m+1}^2 ) is not a prime. Therefore, ( m leq 4 ).6. Finding the Largest ( n ):   For ( m = 4 ),   [   n = p_3 p_4 p_5 = 3 cdot 5 cdot 7 = 105   ]   We check that all odd integers ( k ) with ( 1 < k < 105 ) and (gcd(k, 105) = 1) are primes.

By taking the negative of these inequalities, we find the range for -sqrt{3}. Since reversing the inequality signs when multiplying or dividing by a negative number, we get -2 < -sqrt{3} < -1.3. Given the original inequality -sqrt{3}＜x＜2.236, we can now identify the integers that lie within this range.

","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the smallest positive real number ( k ) such that for any connected graph ( G ) with ( n ) vertices and ( m ) edges, it is possible to delete at most ( k(m - lfloor frac{n}{2} rfloor) ) edges to make the graph bipartite (i.e., 2-colorable).2. Graph Theory Basics:   A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent. A graph is bipartite if and only if it does not contain an odd-length cycle.3. Edge Deletion to Achieve Bipartiteness:   To make a graph bipartite, we need to remove edges to eliminate all odd-length cycles. The goal is to find the minimum number of edges that need to be removed.4. Random Partitioning Argument:   Consider partitioning the vertices of ( G ) randomly into two sets. The expected number of edges between the two sets (cross edges) is ( frac{1}{2}m ). This is because each edge has a ( frac{1}{2} ) probability of being a cross edge.5. Improving the Estimate:   The random partitioning argument gives us a baseline, but we need a sharper estimate. The sharper estimate involves the term ( frac{|V|}{4} ). This term accounts for the fact that we can often do better than the random partitioning.6. Sharpness of the Estimate:   The term ( frac{|V|}{4} ) is derived from more advanced combinatorial arguments and is known to be sharp. This means that for any graph, we can always find a partition such that the number of cross edges is at least ( frac{1}{2}m + frac{n}{4} ).7. Conclusion:   Given the above arguments, the smallest ( k ) that satisfies the condition is ( frac{1}{2} ). This is because we can always ensure that at least ( frac{1}{2}m ) edges are cross edges, and the additional term ( frac{n}{4} ) ensures that we can achieve bipartiteness by removing at most ( frac{1}{2}(m - lfloor frac{n}{2} rfloor) ) edges.The final answer is ( boxed{ k = frac{1}{2} } )."},{"problem":"Given p: x=2, and q: 0<x<3, then p is the (　　) condition for q.A: Sufficient but not necessary conditionB: Necessary but not sufficient conditionC: Necessary and sufficient conditionD: Neither sufficient nor necessary condition","solution":"Analysis:  Since the proposition p: x=2 obviously satisfies 0<x<3, p is a sufficient condition for q.

Here is a step-by-step solution:1. Understanding the Geometry of Reflections:   When two mirrors form an angle (alpha), the reflections of an object placed between them can be visualized by considering the repeated reflections of the object in each mirror. Each reflection in one mirror can be reflected again in the other mirror, creating multiple images.2. Using the Concept of Symmetry:   To simplify the problem, we can imagine extending the mirrors to form a complete circle by repeating the angle (alpha) around a point. This would create a full circle of (360^circ).3. Calculating the Number of Reflections:   The number of times the angle (alpha) fits into (360^circ) gives us the number of sectors formed by the mirrors. Mathematically, this is given by:   [   frac{360^circ}{alpha}   ]   Since we are interested in the number of reflections, we need to consider the greatest integer function (floor function) to count the complete sectors:   [   leftlfloor frac{360^circ}{alpha} rightrfloor   ]   This represents the number of distinct images formed by the reflections.4. Subtracting the Original Candle:   The observer sees the original candle plus the reflections. Therefore, the number of reflections seen is:   [   leftlfloor frac{360^circ}{alpha} rightrfloor - 1   ]5.

Let the right angle vertex of the ABC triangle be C. Then, by extending the sides CA and CB, we can place the triangle inside a unit square CGPF.

The area of the square is 1, sofrac{x c}{2} + frac{a b}{2} + frac{1-a}{2} + frac{1-b}{2} = 1Since the perimeter of the triangle is 2, we havec = 2 - a - bSubstituting this into the previous equation, we getx = frac{a + b - ab}{2 - a - b}By the Pythagorean theorem, a^2 + b^2 = c^2 = (2 - a - b)^2. Squaring and simplifying this equation, we get 4 - 4a - 4b + 2ab = 0, from which 2 - a - b = a + b - ab. Substituting this into the previous equation for x, we get x = 1.Since GP = EP = 1, the right triangles PGB and PEB are congruent. Similarly, the congruence of triangles PEA and PFA can be shown. This implies that angle GPC = angle BPE and angle EPA = angle APF. Therefore, the angle angle BPA is half of the right angle angle GPF, i.e., angle BPA = angle BPE + angle EPA = 45^circ.Note. From the equality PG = PE = PF, we can conclude that point P is the center of the circle circumscribed around the hypotenuse of the triangle. It is known that in a right triangle, the radius of the circle circumscribed around the hypotenuse is equal to half the perimeter, which is 1 unit in this case. This statement can essentially be proven using the reasoning in the above solution. Furthermore, the lengths of the tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal, so PGBE and PEAF are kites, from which the solution to the problem can also be obtained.II. solution. Using the diagram from the previous solution, let angle APF = alpha and angle GPC = beta. The equation 4 - 4a - 4b + 2ab = 0 derived in the previous solution can be rearranged asa = frac{2 - 2b}{2 - b} = 2 - frac{2}{2 - b}Then AF = 1 - b and BG = 1 - a = frac{2}{2 - b} - 1. Furthermore,tan alpha = frac{1 - b}{1}, quad text{and} quad tan beta = frac{frac{2}{2 - b} - 1}{1}Using the tangent addition formula,tan(alpha + beta) = frac{tan alpha + tan beta}{1 - tan alpha tan beta} = frac{(1 - b) + left(frac{2}{2 - b} - 1right)}{1 - (1 - b)left(frac{2}{2 - b} - 1right)} = frac{(1 - b)(2 - b) + b}{(2 - b) - (1 - b)b} = 1Thus, tan(alpha + beta) = 1, which implies alpha + beta = 45^circ. Since angle BPA = 90^circ - (alpha + beta) = 45^circ, the measure of the desired angle is 45^circ.Note. Using trigonometric functions, another solution can be obtained by first applying the cosine rule to the sides PB and PA of triangles PBC and CAP (from which PB^2 = a^2 - 2a + 2 and PA^2 = b^2 - 2b + 2 follow), and then applying the cosine rule again to the side BA of triangle PBA (which gives cos angle APB = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} as the final result). Some solved this problem using coordinate geometry, in which case the measure of angle angle APB can be calculated from the dot product of vectors overrightarrow{PA} and overrightarrow{PB}.III. solution. Using the notation from the previous solutions. Rotate the triangle PGB 90^circ counterclockwise around P.

Claim:   - In a triangle ABC, IG parallel AB if and only if CA + CB = 2 cdot AB.3. Proof of the Claim:   - IG parallel AB implies that the areas of triangles IAB and GAB are proportional to the lengths of their bases.   - The area of triangle IAB is proportional to AB and the area of triangle GAB is frac{1}{3} of the area of triangle ABC.   - Therefore, [IAB] = frac{AB}{AB + AC + BC} [ABC].   - Since [GAB] = frac{1}{3} [ABC], we have:     [     [IAB] = [GAB] iff frac{AB}{AB + AC + BC} [ABC] = frac{1}{3} [ABC] iff CA + CB = 2 cdot AB.     ]   - This completes the proof of the claim. blacksquare4.

Therefore, ( xy = ab ) is divisible by 4, and thus the even number among ( a ) and ( b ) is 4 (Anya simply has no other multiples of four). Then the pair of numbers ( x ) and ( y ) must be 2 and 6. Their product is 12, so the number paired with 4 is 3.Thus, the product of the two remaining numbers is necessarily 12.

By using the equation of the ellipse, we can find the coordinates of the vertices, then determine the coordinates of the circle's center, and finally calculate the radius to obtain the circle's equation.Step-by-step Solution1. Find the coordinates of the vertices using the given ellipse equation frac{x^{2}}{16} + frac{y^{2}}{4} = 1. The right vertex is at (4,0), and the upper and lower vertices are at (0, pm 2).2. Since the circle's center lies on the negative semi-axis of x, let's denote the center as (a, 0) where a < 0.3. Given that the circle passes through the vertices (4,0) and (0, 2), we can write the distance between the center (a, 0) and vertex (4,0) as sqrt{(a-4)^2 + 0^2} = 4 - a.4.

For the integer coefficient equation ax^2+bx+c=0 (a neq 0), if Delta is a perfect square, then the equation must have rational roots;  Since the roots of the equation are x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}, x is rational only if Delta is a perfect square.

These roots are x = -4 and x = 6. Therefore, M consists of all x such that -4 < x < 6.- For set N={x | x-5 < 0}, solving the inequality x-5 < 0 gives x < 5. Thus, N includes all x less than 5.- The union M cup N combines elements from both sets. Since M includes values from -4 to 6 and N includes values less than 5, their union extends to include all x less than 6. Therefore, M cup N = {x | x < 6}.- The complement of N in mathbb{R}, denoted overline{N}_mathbb{R}, consists of all real numbers not in N. Since N includes all x less than 5, its complement includes all x greater than or equal to 5. Hence, overline{N}_mathbb{R} = {x | x geq 5}.The final answers for part (1) are M cup N = {x | x < 6} and overline{N}_mathbb{R} = {x | x geq 5}. # Part 2: Finding the Range of t for P subseteq M- For P={x | |x|=t} to be a subset of M, where M={x | -4 < x < 6}, the absolute value condition splits into two cases depending on the sign of x.- When P=varnothing, it means no x satisfies the condition, implying t < 0.- When P neq varnothing, it means there are values of x that satisfy the condition. This leads to two inequalities due to the absolute value:    1. t geq 0, because absolute values are non-negative.    2. -4 < t < 6, because t itself must be within the bounds of M.    3. -4 < -t < 6, because if |x| = t, then x can be t or -t, and both must be within the bounds of M.- Combining these conditions, we find that 0 leq t < 4, as t must be non-negative and satisfy both -4 < t < 6 and -4 < -t < 6.- Therefore, the range of t that allows P to be a subset of M is (-infty, 4), considering both when P is empty and when it is not.The final answer for part (2) is the range of t:boxed{(-infty, 4)}"},{"problem":"If the frequency f(n) of an event A is obtained by conducting n repeated experiments under the same conditions, then as n gradually increases, there is ( )A: f(n) equals a constantB: The difference between f(n) and a certain constant gradually decreasesC: The absolute value of the difference between f(n) and a certain constant gradually decreasesD: f(n) fluctuates around a certain constant and tends to stabilize","solution":"From the relationship between frequency and probability, we know that when conducting n repeated experiments under the same conditions to obtain the frequency f(n) of an event A happening, as n gradually increases, the frequency f(n) gradually approaches the probability.

Initial Example:   - Consider ( a = 9 ), ( p = 2 ), and ( b = 6 ).   - Substituting these values, we get:     [ frac{9^2 - 9}{2} = frac{81 - 9}{2} = frac{72}{2} = 36 = 6^2. ]   - This satisfies the equation, but we need to find the smallest ( a ).2. Analyzing the Equation:   - The equation ( a(a^{p-1} - 1) = pb^2 ) implies that ( a ) and ( a^{p-1} - 1 ) must be such that their product is divisible by ( p ) and results in a perfect square when divided by ( p ).   - Since ( a ) and ( a^{p-1} - 1 ) are coprime, ( a ) must be a multiple of ( p ) or ( a ) itself must be a perfect square.3. Checking Small Values of ( a ):   - We check ( a = 1, 2, ldots, 8 ) with corresponding possible ( p ):     - For ( a = 1 ):       [ frac{1^p - 1}{p} = 0 quad text{(not a perfect square)}. ]     - For ( a = 2 ):       [ frac{2^p - 2}{p} quad text{(not a perfect square for any prime ( p ))}. ]     - Continue similarly for ( a = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ), none of these values satisfy the equation for any prime ( p ).4.

Understanding the Problem:   - We need to find alpha such that the set A(alpha) misses exactly those integers that have the same remainder r modulo 2021.   - This implies that the integers not in A(alpha) form an arithmetic sequence of the form r, 2021 + r, 2 cdot 2021 + r, dots.2. Case 1: alpha is Irrational:   - By Beatty's theorem, for an irrational alpha, there exists a beta such that frac{1}{alpha} + frac{1}{beta} = 1.   - The sets A(alpha) and A(beta) partition the positive integers.   - If A(beta) contains all integers of the form r + k cdot 2021, then beta must be such that lfloor kbeta rfloor = r + k cdot 2021.   - This leads to contradictions as shown in the solution, implying no irrational alpha satisfies the condition.3. Case 2: alpha is Rational:   - Let alpha = frac{a}{b} with a, b in mathbb{N} and gcd(a, 2021) = 1.   - If gcd(a, 2021) = 1, then there exists an integer k such that ak equiv 1 pmod{2021}.   - This leads to contradictions as shown in the solution, implying gcd(a, 2021) > 1.4. Subcase 2.1: alpha = frac{47}{b}:   - Similar contradictions arise when considering alpha = frac{47}{b}, leading to no valid solutions.5. Subcase 2.2: alpha = frac{2021}{b}:   - Consider alpha = frac{2021}{b}.   - For alpha = frac{2021}{2020}, we have lfloor k alpha rfloor = lfloor frac{2021k}{2020} rfloor.   - This simplifies to lfloor k + frac{k}{2020} rfloor.   - For k = 2020, lfloor 2020 alpha rfloor = lfloor 2021 rfloor = 2021.   - This implies r = 2020 is the only remainder skipped, making alpha = frac{2021}{2020} a valid solution.

By induction, it follows similarly that {k, n+k, 2 n+k} is an element of any maximal partition for 1 leqslant k leqslant n, since integers allowing for smaller or larger differences have already been used up.
