Let us now consider two cases separately.1^{circ} .left|-frac{p}{2}right| geqslant 1 (Fig. 130, a). Suppose our polynomial takes the value P(1)=a at x=1, and the value P(-1)=b at x=-1; the deviation of the polynomial P(x) from zero is obviously the greater of the numbers |a| and |b|. Now consider the polynomialP_{1}(x)=x^{2}+p x+q-frac{a+b}{2}=x^{2}+p x+q_{1}for this polynomial,P_{1}(1)=a-frac{a+b}{2}=frac{a-b}{2} ; P_{1}(-1)=b-frac{a+b}{2}=frac{b-a}{2}i.e., P_{1}(1)=-P_{1}(-1). It is easy to see that the deviation of the polynomial P_{1}(x) from zero is no greater than the deviation of the original polynomial P(x) (the graph of the polynomial P_{1}(x) is obtained from the graph of P(x) by a parallel shift in the direction of the O y axis such that the O x axis is equidistant from the ends of the curve corresponding to the values x=+1 and x=-1; see Fig. 130, a, where the graph of the polynomial P_{1}(x) is shown with a dashed line).

In this case, obviously,left|P(1)-Pleft(-frac{p}{2}right)right| geqslantleft|P(-1)-Pleft(-frac{p}{2}right)right|(see Fig. 130, b).

Thus, the deviation of the polynomial P(x) is no less than the deviation of P_{1}(x), which isbegin{aligned}frac{left|P_{1}(1)-P_{1}left(-frac{p}{2}right)right|}{2} & =frac{left|left(1+p+q_{1}right)-left(frac{p^{2}}{4}-frac{p^{2}}{2}+q_{1}right)right|}{2}= & =frac{left|frac{p^{2}}{4}+p+1right|}{2}=frac{left|left(frac{p}{2}+1right)^{2}right|}{2}end{aligned}Since 0 leq frac{p}{2}<1, the deviation from zero will have the smallest value frac{1}{2} when p=0; in this case, if P_{1}left(-frac{p}{2}right)= =-P_{1}(1), then q_{1}=-frac{1}{2}.Finally, we conclude that the smallest deviation from zero on the interval -1 leqslant x leqslant+1 will be achieved by the polynomialP_{0}(x)=x^{2}-frac{1}{2}(Fig. 130, c); its deviation is frac{1}{2}."},{"problem":"11.

Therefore, a and b must have the same parity (both even or both odd).Assume f(x)=0 has an integer root t, then f(t)=0 which means at^2+bt+c=0.If a and b are both even, then at^2+bt is even. Consequently, at^2+bt+c is odd. This implies that at^2+bt+c neq 0, which contradicts at^2+bt+c=0.If a and b are both odd, and t is an even integer, then at^2+bt is even. And if t is odd, then at^2+bt is even again due to the sum of two odd numbers being even. Thus, at^2+bt+c is odd in either case, leading again to at^2+bt+c neq 0, which contradicts at^2+bt+c=0.Both cases result in a contradiction. Hence, we conclude that the equation f(x)=0 has no integer roots.Proof of (2):Given that a, b, and c are positive real numbers, with a+b+c=1, we can apply the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means (AM-GM inequality) to obtain:frac {1}{a} + frac {1}{b} + frac {1}{c} geq 3sqrt[3]{frac {1}{a} cdot frac {1}{b} cdot frac {1}{c}}.Since the product abc is positive, and by the constraint a+b+c=1, we can rewrite our inequality as:frac {1}{a} + frac {1}{b} + frac {1}{c} geq 3sqrt[3]{frac {1}{abc}} = 3sqrt[3]{frac {1}{{frac {1}{a+b+c}}}} = 3sqrt[3]{(a+b+c)^3} = 3(a+b+c) = 3 cdot 1.Calculating the cube of both sides gives us:left( frac {1}{a} + frac {1}{b} + frac {1}{c} right)^3 geq 27.From 1 = a+b+c, we have abc leq left(frac{a+b+c}{3}right)^3 = frac{1}{27} by AM-GM inequality, and substituting this into the previous inequality gives us:frac {1}{a} + frac {1}{b} + frac {1}{c} geq 3cdot 3sqrt[3]{frac {1}{abc}} geq 3cdot 3sqrt[3]{27} = 9.The equality holds if and only if a = b = c, which means all are equal to frac{1}{3}, the point at which we have equality in the AM-GM inequality.Thus, we have proven that frac {1}{a} + frac {1}{b} + frac {1}{c} geq boxed{9}."},{"problem":"Given that the radius of the top base of a frustum is 2 and the radius of the bottom base is 6, if the volume of the frustum is 104pi, then the length of its slant height is ____.","solution":"To solve for the height h of the frustum, we use the formula for the volume of a frustum, which is given by V = frac{1}{3}pi h(r_1^2 + r_2^2 + r_1r_2), where r_1 and r_2 are the radii of the top and bottom bases, respectively, and h is the height of the frustum.

What could be the distance between the centers of two excircles?","solution":"Solution. Let the vertices and angles of the triangle be denoted in the usual way by A, B, C, and alpha, beta, gamma, respectively. Let the center of the inscribed circle be O, and the centers of the excircles be O_{A}, O_{B}, and O_{C}. We know that the center of the inscribed circle is the intersection of the three internal angle bisectors, while the centers of the excircles are the intersections of two external and one internal angle bisectors. Since the internal and external angle bisectors at any vertex of a triangle are perpendicular to each other, A O_{A} perp O_{B} O_{C}, B O_{B} perp O_{A} O_{C}, and C O_{C} perp O_{B} O_{A}. Therefore, the segments A O_{A}, B O_{B}, and C O_{C} are the altitudes of the triangle O_{A} O_{B} O_{C}, so the points A, B, and C are the feet of the altitudes of this triangle, which means the circle passing through them (which is also the circumcircle of the triangle A B C) is the Feuerbach circle of the triangle O_{A} O_{B} O_{C}. It is known that the radius of the Feuerbach circle of any triangle is exactly half the radius of the circumcircle of the triangle, so the radius of the circumcircle of the triangle O_{A} O_{B} O_{C} is R=2 units.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_88518a9bf9d545bd7027g-1.jpg?height=591&width=616&top_left_y=553&top_left_x=749)Due to the symmetric role of the centers of the excircles, it is sufficient to determine the possible values of the distance O_{A} O_{B}. According to the generalized sine theorem, O_{A} O_{B}=2 R sin angle O_{B} O_{C} O_{A}, so we need to determine the possible values of angle O_{B} O_{C} O_{A}. Sinceangle A B O_{C} = angle O_{B} B O_{C} - angle O_{B} B A = 90^{circ} - angle O B A = 90^{circ} - frac{beta}{2},and similarly, we get that angle B A O_{C} = 90^{circ} - frac{alpha}{2},begin{aligned}angle O_{B} O_{C} O_{A} & = angle A O_{C} B = 180^{circ} - left( angle A B O_{C} + angle B A O_{C} right) = & = 180^{circ} - left( left( 90^{circ} - frac{beta}{2} right) + left( 90^{circ} - frac{alpha}{2} right) right) = frac{alpha + beta}{2}.end{aligned}Thus,O_{A} O_{B} = 4 sin frac{alpha + beta}{2}In the triangle A B C, the angle gamma can take any value between 0^{circ} and 180^{circ}, so frac{alpha + beta}{2} can be any angle between 0^{circ} and 90^{circ}, meaning its sine can take any value between 0 and 1. Therefore, the distance between the centers of two excircles of a triangle inscribed in a unit circle is greater than 0 but less than 4, and with the appropriate choice of the triangle, it can be achieved that for any value 0 < d < 4, there are two excircles of the triangle whose centers are exactly d units apart."},{"problem":"From 56 male teachers and 42 female teachers, using stratified sampling, a sample of size 14 is drawn.

The list obtained by removing the least element is sortable in ( k-1 ) passes.3. Formulating the Problem:   - Let ( f(n, k) ) be the number of lists sortable in ( k ) passes.   - For ( n < k ), the list is always sortable in ( k ) passes, so ( f(n, k) = n! ).   - For ( n geq k ), the number of sortable lists is given by:     [     f(n, k) = k! cdot (k+1)^{n-k}     ]   - This formula accounts for the fact that once we reach ( k+1 ), we keep multiplying by ( k+1 ) instead of incrementing the multiplier.4. Applying the Formula:   - In our problem, ( k = 3 ) and ( n geq 3 ).   - Therefore, the number of sortable configurations is:     [     f(n, 3) = 3! cdot 4^{n-3}     ]   - Simplifying, we get:     [     f(n, 3) = 6 cdot 4^{n-3}     ]5.

We use the formula for the sum of a geometric series and its derivative:   [   sum_{k=1}^n k z^k = frac{z (1 - (n+1)z^n + n z^{n+1})}{(1-z)^2}   ]5. Applying this formula, we get:   [   sum_{k=1}^{2020} k z^k = frac{z (1 - 2021 z^{2020} + 2020 z^{2021})}{(1-z)^2}   ]6. Similarly, for (z^{-1}):   [   sum_{k=1}^{2020} k z^{-k} = frac{z^{-1} (1 - 2021 z^{-2020} + 2020 z^{-2021})}{(1-z^{-1})^2}   ]7. Simplifying the denominator:   [   (1 - z^{-1})^2 = left(frac{z-1}{z}right)^2 = frac{(z-1)^2}{z^2}   ]8. Therefore:   [   sum_{k=1}^{2020} k z^{-k} = frac{z^{-1} (1 - 2021 z^{-2020} + 2020 z^{-2021}) z^2}{(z-1)^2} = frac{z (1 - 2021 z^{-2020} + 2020 z^{-2021})}{(z-1)^2}   ]9. Adding the two sums:   [   sum_{k=1}^{2020} k cos left(frac{4 k pi}{4041}right) = frac{1}{2} left( frac{z (1 - 2021 z^{2020} + 2020 z^{2021}) + z (1 - 2021 z^{-2020} + 2020 z^{-2021})}{(1-z)^2} right)   ]10. Simplifying the numerator:    [    z (1 - 2021 z^{2020} + 2020 z^{2021}) + z (1 - 2021 z^{-2020} + 2020 z^{-2021}) = 2z - 2021 z^{2021} - 2021 z^{-2019} + 2020 z^{2022} + 2020 z^{-2020}    ]11. Using (z = e^{i frac{4 pi}{4041}}), we know that (z^{4041} = 1). Therefore, (z^{2021} = z^{-2020}) and (z^{2022} = z^{-2019}).12. The expression simplifies to:    [    2z - 2021 z^{2021} - 2021 z^{-2019} + 2020 z^{2022} + 2020 z^{-2020} = 2z - 2021 z^{2021} - 2021 z^{-2020} + 2020 z^{2022} + 2020 z^{-2021}    ]13. Recognizing the symmetry and simplifying further, we get:    [    sum_{k=1}^{2020} k cos left(frac{4 k pi}{4041}right) = frac{2z - 2021 z^{2021} - 2021 z^{-2020} + 2020 z^{2022} + 2020 z^{-2021}}{2(1-z)^2}    ]14. Finally, we express the sum in the required form:    [    sum_{k=1}^{2020} k cos left(frac{4 k pi}{4041}right) = frac{cos left(frac{2 pi}{4041}right) - 1}{4 sin^2 left(frac{2 pi}{4041}right)}    ]15. Comparing with the given form (frac{a cos left(frac{p pi}{q}right)-b}{c sin ^{2}left(frac{p pi}{q}right)}), we identify (a = 1), (b = 1), (c = 4), (p = 2), and (q = 4041).16. Summing these values:    [    a + b + c + p + q = 1 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 4041 = 4049    ]The final answer is (boxed{4049})"},{"problem":"Given the function f(x) = ln(ax+1) + x^3 - x^2 - ax.1.

Therefore, 3a(frac{2}{3})^2 + frac{2}{3}(3-2a) - (a^2+2) = 0 and frac{2}{3}a + 1 neq 0.  Thus, we have a = 0.

Identify the quadratic residues modulo 11:   The quadratic residues modulo 11 are the possible remainders when squares of integers are divided by 11. These residues are:   [   {0, 1, 4, 9, 5, 3}   ]   This can be verified by squaring each integer from 0 to 10 and taking the result modulo 11.2.

The median KH of the right triangle ACH is equal to AC / 2 = KC (it is the radius of the circumcircle of ACH).Both of these facts are true for any triangle ABC. Additionally, in this triangle, KC = CH. This follows from the equality of the right triangles KCO and CHM (CM = CO by the condition and angle KCO = angle HCM as proven). Therefore, triangle KCH is equilateral, and the desired angle C is 60^{circ}.2nd solution. This solution is based on the following observation: in any triangle, the distance from the orthocenter to a vertex is twice the distance from the center of the circumcircle to the opposite side (in figure b, CM = 2OC_1). This fact is incidentally obtained during the proof of Euler's theorem (see the solution to problem 4.8). Now, from the condition of the problem, it immediately follows that in the right triangle BOC_1, the leg OC_1 is equal to BO / 2, and thus angle BOC_1 = 60^{circ}.

Therefore, we can eliminate options A and D because they suggest a negative relationship (hat{y}=-1.4x+19.4 and hat{y}=-1.4x-19.4 respectively).Step 2: Calculate the Means of x and yTo proceed, we calculate the means of x and y:- overline{x} = frac{2+5+6+8+9}{5} = frac{30}{5} = 6- overline{y} = frac{7+8+10+12+18}{5} = frac{55}{5} = 11Step 3: Verify the Regression EquationGiven the empirical regression equation form hat{y}=hat{b}x+hat{a}, we need to verify which option correctly represents the relationship between x and y.- For option B: hat{y}=1.4x+2.6, substituting the mean values (overline{x}, overline{y}) = (6, 11):  hat{y} = 1.4(6) + 2.6 = 8.4 + 2.6 = 11  This matches our calculation for overline{y}, indicating that option B correctly represents the relationship.- For option C: hat{y}=1.4x-2.6, substituting the mean values:  hat{y} = 1.4(6) - 2.6 = 8.4 - 2.6 = 5.8  This does not match our calculation for overline{y}, indicating that option C is incorrect.ConclusionBased on the analysis and verification steps, we conclude that the correct empirical regression equation of y with respect to x is represented by option B: hat{y}=1.4x+2.6.Therefore, the correct answer is: boxed{B}."},{"problem":"Problem 5.

However, the value of n does not affect the sum of the exterior angles due to the concept mentioned in Step 1.Step 3: State the sum of the exterior angles of a pentagon.  Based on the concept that the sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is always the same, we conclude that for a pentagon, which is a type of polygon, this sum is:boxed{360 text{ degrees}}"},{"problem":"When Clara totaled her scores, she inadvertently reversed the units digit and the tens digit of one score.

Prove that the sequence {an + 1} is a geometric sequence.2. If sequence {bn} satisfies bn = frac{n(a_{n} + 1)}{2}, find the sum of the first n terms of {bn}, denoted as Tn.","solution":"1. Proof: Given Sn = 2an - n, when n ≥ 2, we have an = Sn - Sn - 1 = 2an - n - (2an - 1 - n + 1), which simplifies to an + 1 = 2(an - 1 + 1). When n = 1, we have a1 = 2a1 - 1, which gives a1 = 1.   Therefore, a1 + 1 = 2.   Hence, {an + 1} is a geometric sequence with the first term equal to 2 and the common ratio equal to 2.2. Solution: From part 1, we have an + 1 = 2n.   Therefore, bn = frac{n(a_{n} + 1)}{2} = n • 2n - 1.   The sum of the first n terms of {bn}, Tn, is given by Tn = 1 + 2 × 2 + 3 × 22 + ... + n • 2n - 1.

This equation suggests a relationship between the sides and angles of the triangle triangle ABC. Step 1: Use the Law of Sines to rewrite the given equation.The Law of Sines states that frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C}. From the given equation, we can express acos B and bsin A in terms of the Law of Sines, leading to the equation sin A cos B = sin B sin A. Step 2: Simplify the equation.Since sin A is present on both sides of the equation and given that angle A is an interior angle of the triangle, we know sin A > 0. This allows us to cancel sin A from both sides, resulting in cos B = sin B. Step 3: Solve for angle B.The equation cos B = sin B holds true when B = frac{pi}{4}, because at this angle, both sin B and cos B are equal to frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.Step 4: Calculate side b using the given values for C and c.Given that C = frac{pi}{6} and c = 2, we can use the Law of Sines again to find b. The Law of Sines gives us b = frac{csin B}{sin C}. Substituting the known values, we get b = frac{2 times frac{sqrt{2}}{2}}{frac{1}{2}}.

Let x be the distance O O^{prime}. If a common tangent to the two circles passing through A touches these circles at M and M^{prime}, it is easy to see by Thales' theorem that: frac{A O^{prime}}{2016}=frac{A O}{2015}=O O^{prime}=x, so A O=2015 times x. By a similar calculation, frac{B O^{prime}}{2016}=frac{B O}{2015}, hence: B O=frac{2015 times x}{2016+2015}. Therefore, A B=(2015 x)left(1+frac{1}{4031}right)=frac{4032 times 2015 times x}{4031}. Since 4031 is prime with 2015 and 4032, 4031 divides x: x=4031 k, so A B=4032 times 2015 times k.

Calculate ( z = |x - y| ):   Subtract ( y ) from ( x ):   [   x - y = (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a)   ]   Simplify the expression:   [   x - y = 100a + 10b + c - 100c - 10b - a   ]   [   x - y = 99a - 99c   ]   Factor out the common term:   [   x - y = 99(a - c)   ]   Therefore:   [   z = |x - y| = |99(a - c)| = 99|a - c|   ]3. Determine the range of ( a ) and ( c ):   Since ( x ) and ( y ) are three-digit numbers, ( a ) and ( c ) must be integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive).4. Calculate the possible values of ( |a - c| ):   The difference ( |a - c| ) can range from 0 to 8. This is because the maximum difference between any two digits from 1 to 9 is 8 (e.g., ( 9 - 1 = 8 )).5. Determine the distinct values of ( z ):   Since ( z = 99|a - c| ), the possible values of ( z ) are:   [   z = 99 times 0, 99 times 1, 99 times 2, ldots, 99 times 8   ]   This gives us the distinct values:   [   z = 0, 99, 198, 297, 396, 495, 594, 693, 792   ]6.

Initial Analysis:   - Anna and Berta take turns removing marbles.   - Anna starts first.   - The player can remove ( k ) marbles where ( k ) is either:     - An even number with ( k leq frac{n}{2} ), or     - An odd number with ( frac{n}{2} leq k leq n ).   - The player who removes the last marble wins.2. Odd Number of Marbles:   - If the number of marbles ( n ) is odd, Anna can always win by taking all the marbles in her first turn.3. Even Number of Marbles:   - If ( n ) is even, the strategy changes. The first player to take an odd number of marbles leaves an odd number of marbles for the opponent, who can then take all remaining marbles and win.   - Therefore, players will prefer to take an even number of marbles ( k leq frac{n}{2} ).4. Special Form ( 2^m - 2 ):   - Consider the number of marbles ( n ) in the form ( 2^m - 2 ) for some ( m geq 2 ).   - If ( k ) is even and ( k leq 2^{m-1} - 2 ), then after removing ( k ) marbles, the number of marbles left is ( 2^m - 2 - k ).   - Since ( 2^{m-1} - 2 < 2^m - 2 - k < 2^m - 2 ), the number of marbles left is not of the form ( 2^m - 2 ).5. General Case:   - Assume ( 2^m - 2 < n < 2^{m+1} - 2 ) for some ( m geq 2 ).   - Since ( n ) is even, ( n leq 2^{m+1} - 4 ) and thus ( frac{n}{2} leq 2^m - 2 ).   - The player can remove ( n - (2^m - 2) ) marbles, leaving ( 2^m - 2 ) marbles on the table.   - This ensures that the number of marbles is of the form ( 2^m - 2 ) when the opponent's turn comes.6. Winning Strategy:   - If the number of marbles is of the form ( 2^m - 2 ), the player not taking the turn can always ensure that the number of marbles remains in this form.   - Eventually, the number of marbles will be reduced to 2, and the player to take the turn will lose.7.

So, |OQ| = sqrt{1+m^2} cdot |y_0| = frac{sqrt{6}sqrt{1+m^2}}{sqrt{2m^2+3}}.Solving for the intersection of line x = my + 1 with the ellipse gives us the quadratic equation (2m^2 + 3)y^2 + 4my - 4 = 0. We then find that y_1 + y_2 = -frac{4m}{2m^2 + 3} and y_1y_2 = -frac{4}{2m^2 + 3}.Hence, |MN|= sqrt{1+m^2}cdot |y_1 - y_2| = sqrt{1+m^2} cdot sqrt{left(y_1 + y_2 right)^2 - 4y_1y_2} simplifies to |MN| = frac{4sqrt{3}(1+m^2)}{2m^2+3}.Therefore, frac{|MN|}{|OQ|^2} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}.(2) Since MN parallel OQ, we have that the area of triangle QF_2M is equal to the area of triangle OF_2M. Thus, S = S_1 + S_2 = text{Area}(triangle OMN).The perpendicular distance (d) from O to line MN: x=my+1 is d = frac{1}{sqrt{m^2+1}}.So, S= frac{1}{2} |MN| cdot d = frac{2sqrt{3}sqrt{m^2+1}}{2m^2+3}.Letting sqrt{m^2+1} = t, we rewrite m^2 as t^2 - 1 where t geq 1, and S = frac{2sqrt{3} t}{2t^2 + 1} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{2t + frac{1}{t}}.For g(t) = 2t + frac{1}{t} (where t geq 1), its derivative g'(t) = 2 - frac{1}{t^2} > 0, which makes g(t) an increasing function over the interval [1, infty).

Understanding the Expression: The expression |x-4|-|x+5| represents the difference between the distances of a point x on the number line to 4 and to -5. This is because the absolute value |x-a| measures the distance between any point x and the point a on the number line.2. Finding the Maximum Difference: To find the maximum value of |x-4|-|x+5|, we need to consider when this difference is maximized. This occurs when x is equidistant from 4 and -5, or in other words, when x is at a point that maximizes the difference between these two distances. However, upon further inspection, we realize that the maximum difference actually occurs when x is at its extreme, specifically when x leqslant -5, not -4 as previously mentioned. This is a correction to the initial analysis.3. Calculating the Maximum Difference: When x leqslant -5, the expression |x-4|-|x+5| reaches its maximum value. To find this maximum value, we can substitute a value of x that is less than or equal to -5 into the expression. Let's choose x = -5 for simplicity:   - For x = -5: |(-5)-4|-|(-5)+5| = |-9|-|0| = 9 - 0 = 9.4. Conclusion: Since the maximum value of |x-4|-|x+5| is 9, for the inequality |x-4|-|x+5| leqslant m to hold for all real numbers x, m must be at least 9. Therefore, we conclude that m geqslant 9.Thus, the range of values for m is encapsulated as boxed{m geqslant 9}."},{"problem":"1.

What is the maximum profit at that price?","solution":" Step-by-Step Solution# Part 1: Finding the Functional Relationship Between y and xGiven the linear relationship between the selling price x (in yuan per kilogram) and the sales volume y (in kilograms), we can express this relationship as y = kx + b, where k is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept.From the table, we have two points that lie on this line: (50, 100) and (60, 90). Substituting these points into the equation gives us two equations:1. Substituting (50, 100) into y = kx + b gives:   [100 = 50k + b]2. Substituting (60, 90) into y = kx + b gives:   [90 = 60k + b]We can solve this system of equations to find k and b:[begin{align*}50k + b &= 100 60k + b &= 90end{align*}]Subtracting the first equation from the second gives:[begin{align*}10k &= -10 k &= -1end{align*}]Substituting k = -1 into the first equation:[begin{align*}50(-1) + b &= 100 b &= 150end{align*}]Therefore, the functional relationship between y and x is y = -x + 150 for 20 leqslant x leqslant 90.# Part 2: Maximizing the Profit wThe profit w can be expressed as w = (x - 20)(-x + 150). Expanding this expression gives:[begin{align*}w &= -x^2 + 170x - 3000 &= -left(x^2 - 170x + 3000right) &= -left(x^2 - 170x + 7225 - 4225right) &= -left(x - 85right)^2 + 4225end{align*}]Since the coefficient of x^2 is negative, the parabola opens downwards, indicating that the maximum value of w occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which is at x = 85.Substituting x = 85 into the equation for w gives:[begin{align*}w &= -left(85 - 85right)^2 + 4225 &= 4225end{align*}]Therefore, the wholesaler maximizes the profit at a price of boxed{85} yuan per kilogram, and the maximum profit at that price is boxed{4225} yuan."},{"problem":"Given left(a-1right)^{2}+|b+1|+sqrt{b+c-a}=0, then a+b+c=______.","solution":"Given the equation left(a-1right)^{2}+|b+1|+sqrt{b+c-a}=0, we aim to find the value of a+b+c.Since the equation is a sum of non-negative terms (squares, absolute values, and square roots are always non-negative), each term must be equal to 0 for their sum to be 0.

The players are seated at equal distances from each other, so when the table stops rotating, exactly one player is opposite each sector and receives the number of coins written on that sector.

This implies that (2a+1) and (2-a) are also opposite numbers because if sqrt[3]{2a+1} = x, then (2a+1) = x^3 and if sqrt[3]{2-a} = -x, then (2-a) = (-x)^3 = -x^3. Hence, x^3 and -x^3 are opposites, which means 2a+1 and 2-a are opposites.3. To find the value of a, we set up the equation 2a+1 + (2-a) = 0 because opposite numbers sum up to zero.4.

(This product is non-zero, because if any of its factors were to vanish, the expression would lose its meaning.) Thus, after the anticipated simplifications, the remaining 4-4 terms can be transformed into the product of two binomials by simple factoring. The common factor 1+a^{2} in the numerator and denominator is certainly positive, and can thus be simplified, so the expression is:K=frac{b+a^{2} c+c+a^{2} b}{1-a^{2} b c-b c+a^{2}}=frac{(b+c)left(1+a^{2}right)}{(1-b c)left(1+a^{2}right)}=frac{b+c}{1-b c}From this, we see that K would not be defined if 1-b c=0.The quotientsfrac{a+b}{1-a b}=d quad text { and } quad frac{c-a}{1+c a}=eoccurring twice in the expression, as well as the form of K when these are substituted,K=frac{d+e}{1-d e}remind us of the addition formula for the tangent function,operatorname{tg}(x+y)=frac{operatorname{tg} x+operatorname{tg} y}{1-operatorname{tg} x operatorname{tg} y}from which the known identity for operatorname{tg}(x-y) follows by considering operatorname{tg}(-y)=-operatorname{tg} y.If we find the angles alpha, beta, gamma between -90^{circ} and 90^{circ} such thatoperatorname{tg} alpha=a, quad operatorname{tg} beta=b, quad operatorname{tg} gamma=cthen, from (1) and (3),d=frac{operatorname{tg} alpha+operatorname{tg} beta}{1-operatorname{tg} alpha operatorname{tg} beta}=operatorname{tg}(alpha+beta) quad text { and } quad mathrm{e}=operatorname{tg}(gamma-alpha)Substituting these into (2), similarly,K=frac{operatorname{tg}(alpha+beta)+operatorname{tg}(gamma-alpha)}{1-operatorname{tg}(alpha+beta) operatorname{tg}(gamma-alpha)}=operatorname{tg}[(alpha+beta)+(gamma-alpha)]=operatorname{tg}(beta+gamma)From this, by transforming (3) and finally (4), we can return to the original notation without intermediate calculations and arrive at the final result of the original transformation.We must note that the angles alpha, beta, gamma exist for any a, b, c, because the function y=operatorname{tg} x takes all values. However, if either1-a b=0or1+c a=0were to hold, or both of these equations were to hold, then the trigonometric transformation would not be valid. Indeed, from (7), a b=1, so neither a nor b is 0, b=1 / a, and thus operatorname{tg} beta=operatorname{ctg} alpha, meaning alpha and beta are complementary angles, their sum is 90^{circ}, or alpha+beta=-90^{circ}, and their tangent is undefined; similarly, if (8) holds, c=-1 / a, operatorname{tg} gamma=-operatorname{ctg} alpha=operatorname{ctg}(-alpha), so gamma+(-alpha)= pm 90^{circ}, and (5) is undefined. In these cases, the trigonometric transformation cannot even begin, just as the algebraic one cannot. And the transformation started cannot be completed with (6) if we find that beta+gamma=90^{circ}, in accordance with the exclusionary remark for the case 1-b c=0.Patrik Fazekas (Mosonmagyaróvár, Kossuth L.

Find the fraction frac{a}{b} for which the sum a+b is as small as possible. Justify your answer","solution":"1. We are given the inequality (frac{4.5}{11} < frac{a}{b} < frac{5}{11}) and need to find the fraction (frac{a}{b}) such that (a) and (b) are positive whole numbers and (a + b) is minimized.2. First, convert the decimal to a fraction: (frac{4.5}{11} = frac{9}{22}). Thus, the inequality becomes:   [   frac{9}{22} < frac{a}{b} < frac{5}{11}   ]3. To find the smallest (a + b), we need to test small values of (a) and (b) that satisfy the inequality. We start with (a = 1):   [   frac{9}{22} < frac{1}{b} < frac{5}{11}   ]   This implies:   [   frac{22}{9} > b > frac{11}{5}   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   2.44 > b > 2.2   ]   Since (b) must be a whole number, there is no integer (b) that satisfies this inequality.4. Next, try (a = 2):   [   frac{9}{22} < frac{2}{b} < frac{5}{11}   ]   This implies:   [   frac{22}{9} cdot 2 > b > frac{11}{5} cdot 2   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   4.88 > b > 4.4   ]   Again, there is no integer (b) that satisfies this inequality.5. Now, try (a = 3):   [   frac{9}{22} < frac{3}{b} < frac{5}{11}   ]   This implies:   [   frac{22}{9} cdot 3 > b > frac{11}{5} cdot 3   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   7.33 > b > 6.6   ]   The only integer (b) that satisfies this inequality is (b = 7).6. Therefore, (frac{a}{b} = frac{3}{7}) satisfies the inequality (frac{9}{22} < frac{3}{7} < frac{5}{11}) and (a + b = 3 + 7 = 10).7. To ensure that this is the smallest possible sum, consider (a geq 4). For (a = 4):   [   frac{9}{22} < frac{4}{b} < frac{5}{11}   ]   This implies:   [   frac{22}{9} cdot 4 > b > frac{11}{5} cdot 4   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   9.78 > b > 8.8   ]   There is no integer (b) that satisfies this inequality.8. For (a geq 5), the value of (b) would be even larger, making (a + b) greater than 10.Thus, the fraction (frac{a}{b} = frac{3}{7}) is the one for which (a + b) is minimized.The final answer is (boxed{frac{3}{7}})."},{"problem":"Let the function f(x) = frac {ax^{3}}{3} - bx^{2} + a^{2}x - frac {1}{3} have an extreme value of 0 at x=1. Find the value of a + b.","solution":"Given f(x) = frac {ax^{3}}{3} - bx^{2} + a^{2}x - frac {1}{3}, we first find its derivative: f'(x) = ax^2 - 2bx + a^2. Since f(x) has an extreme value at x=1, the derivative at that point must be zero, therefore: f'(1) = a - 2b + a^2 = 0. quad (1)   Also, since the extreme value at x=1 is given as 0, we obtain: f(1) = frac{a(1)^3}{3} - b(1)^2 + a^2(1) - frac{1}{3} = 0. quad (2)   Solving equation (2) gives us a/3 - b + a^2 - 1/3 = 0. As the coefficient of the x term is a^2, and it should not affect the constant term's balance with a/3 - 1/3, we deduce that the value a^2 must not interfere with this balance, hinting that a = 1 or a = -frac{2}{3}.Upon substituting a=1 into equation (1), we find that the requirement of having an extreme value is not satisfied, as this would imply b would also have to be 1/2, which would not result in f(1)=0.So, we must have a = -frac{2}{3}. Substituting this back into equation (1), we get: (-frac{2}{3}) - 2b + (-frac{2}{3})^2 = 0,which simplifies to: frac{4}{9} - frac{2}{3} - 2b = 0.Further simplification gives us: -2b = frac{2}{3} - frac{4}{9} = frac{2}{9}.Thus b = -frac{1}{9}.Finally, we have a = -frac{2}{3} and b = -frac{1}{9}, therefore a + b = -frac{2}{3} - frac{1}{9}.

Therefore, |sin x| cdot |cos y| = |sin y|. This means |sin x| geq |sin y|, and the inequality becomes an equality only if either sin y = sin x = 0, or |cos y| = 1 (which again implies sin y = sin x = 0). Similarly, from the remaining equations, we obtain the inequalities |sin y| geq |sin z| and |sin z| geq |sin x|. Thus, |sin x| geq |sin y| geq |sin z| geq |sin x|. Therefore, |sin x| = |sin y| = |sin z|. Since all inequalities have become equalities, we have sin x = sin y = sin z = 0, and sin x + sin y + sin z = 0.Second solution. If one of the sines is zero, then the tangent equal to it is also zero, which means the sine in the numerator of the tangent is zero. Consequently, the other sines and tangents are also zero. In this case, sin x + sin y + sin z = 0.Suppose none of the sines are zero. Multiplying all three equations, we get sin x sin y sin z = tan y tan z tan x = frac{sin x sin y sin z}{cos x cos y cos z}. Since sin x sin y sin z neq 0, we have cos x cos y cos z = 1. This is only possible if |cos x| = |cos y| = |cos z| = 1, which means the sines are zero, and the considered case is impossible.Comment.

He decided to change his access code to provide the largest number of possible combinations for a burglar to try when the digits are known. For each number of distinct digits that could be used in the access code, calculate the number of possible combinations when the digits are known but their order and frequency are not known. For example, if there are smudges on 3 and 9, two possible codes are 393939 and 993999. Which number of distinct digits in the access code offers the most combinations?","solution":"1. Define ( f(x) ) as the number of possible combinations for the access code given that it has ( x ) distinct digits, for all integers ( 1 leq x leq 6 ). Clearly, ( f(1) = 1 ).2. We claim that ( f(n) = n^6 - left( sum_{i=1}^{n-1} binom{n}{i} f(i) right) ) for all integers ( 2 leq n leq 6 ).3. To prove this, note that the number of ways to have a 6-digit access code using a given set of ( n ) digits is ( n^6 ) if not all of the digits must be used. We now proceed with complementary counting.4. Since ( n ) is an integer ( 2 leq n leq 6 ), this means that ( n^6 ) equals the sum of the number of ways to have a 6-digit access code using ( a ) of the digits in the set of ( n ) digits, where ( a ) is any arbitrary positive integer less than or equal to ( n ).5. When ( a = n ), we can only choose one set with ( a ) elements that is a subset of our original set of ( n ) digits, so the number of 6-digit access codes formable using all ( n ) of the digits in the set of ( n ) digits is ( f(n) ).6. Thus, ( f(n) ) is ( n^6 ) minus the number of 6-digit access codes that can be formed by only using a proper subset of the original set of ( n ) digits.7. Therefore, ( f(n) ) is equal to ( n^6 ) minus the number of six-digit access codes that can be formed by only using exactly ( b ) of the digits in the original set, where ( b ) ranges from the integers from 1 to ( n-1 ).8. For any particular value of ( b ), there are ( binom{n}{b} ) subsets of the set of ( n ) digits with ( b ) digits. Also, for any subset ( C ) of the set of ( n ) digits with ( b ) elements, the number of ways to form a 6-digit access code using all of the elements in ( C ) is ( f(b) ), so the number of ways to form a 6-digit access code using exactly ( b ) digits from the subset of the ( n ) digits is ( binom{n}{b} f(b) ) for all integers ( 1 leq b leq n-1 ).9. A 6-digit access code cannot be formed without using any digits, so the number of ways to form a 6-digit access code by only using digits from a proper subset of the set of ( n ) digits is ( sum_{i=1}^{n-1} binom{n}{i} f(i) ).10. Thus, ( f(n) = n^6 - left( sum_{i=1}^{n-1} binom{n}{i} f(i) right) ) for all integers ( 2 leq n leq 6 ).11. Now, we can calculate ( f(i) ) for all integers ( 2 leq i leq 6 ).[begin{align*}f(2) &= 2^6 - left( sum_{i=1}^{1} binom{2}{i} f(i) right) = 64 - 2 = 62, f(3) &= 3^6 - left( sum_{i=1}^{2} binom{3}{i} f(i) right) = 729 - 3 cdot 62 - 3 cdot 1 = 729 - 189 = 540, f(4) &= 4^6 - left( sum_{i=1}^{3} binom{4}{i} f(i) right) = 4096 - 4 cdot 540 - 6 cdot 62 - 4 cdot 1 = 4096 - 2536 = 1560, f(5) &= 5^6 - left( sum_{i=1}^{4} binom{5}{i} f(i) right) = 15625 - 5 cdot 1560 - 10 cdot 540 - 10 cdot 62 - 5 cdot 1 = 15625 - 13825 = 1800, f(6) &= 6^6 - left( sum_{i=1}^{5} binom{6}{i} f(i) right) = 46656 - 6 cdot 1800 - 15 cdot 1560 - 20 cdot 540 - 15 cdot 62 - 6 cdot 1 = 46656 - 45936 = 720.end{align*}]12.

Let beta=alpha-f(alpha), then f(beta)=-2 beta. If beta>0, then -2 beta<0, which is a contradiction; if beta<0, then f(beta)=-f(-beta)<0, which is also a contradiction. Therefore, beta=0.

Since k^{2}+1 is always positive (because the square of any real number is non-negative and adding 1 ensures it's strictly positive), the value of y depends inversely on x.

What is the minimum possible sum of the areas of these two triangles?","solution":"Let's denote the length of one segment as x and the other as 12 - x, where 0 < x < 12.The perimeter of each equilateral triangle becomes the length of the wire segment used to form it. The side length of each triangle can be found by dividing the perimeter by 3. Therefore, the side length of the first triangle is frac{x}{3}, and for the second triangle, it is frac{12 - x}{3}.The area of an equilateral triangle with side length a is given by frac{sqrt{3}}{4}a^2. Using this formula, we can derive the sum of the areas of the two triangles, denoted as S:S = frac{sqrt{3}}{4}left(frac{x}{3}right)^2 + frac{sqrt{3}}{4}left(frac{12 - x}{3}right)^2Simplifying the expression:S = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} left(frac{x^2}{9}right) + frac{sqrt{3}}{4} left(frac{(12 - x)^2}{9}right)S = frac{sqrt{3}}{36}(x^2 + (12 - x)^2)Expanding the square term:S = frac{sqrt{3}}{36}(x^2 + 144 - 24x + x^2)Combine like terms:S = frac{sqrt{3}}{36}(2x^2 - 24x + 144)To minimize S, we need to find the minimum of this quadratic function.

We are to determine which of the statements A, B, C, and D is correct.Step 1: Analyzing Statement AThe focus of a parabola defined by y^2 = 4ax is (a,0). For the given parabola E: y^{2}=4x, comparing it with y^2 = 4ax, we find a=1. Therefore, the coordinates of the focus are indeed (1,0).boxed{text{Statement A is correct}}Step 2: Analyzing Statement B and CLet's denote the midpoint of A and B as D. The coordinates of D are given by Dleft(frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}, frac{y_{1}+y_{2}}{2}right). Since A and B are symmetric with respect to the line x=ky+4, we have the relationship x_{1}+x_{2}=k(y_{1}+y_{2})+8.The slope of line AB is given by k_{AB}=frac{y_{1}-y_{2}}{x_{1}-x_{2}}. Given that A and B are symmetric with respect to x=ky+4, we deduce that k_{AB}=-k. Using the equations of the parabola, we have y_{1}^{2}=4x_{1} and y_{2}^{2}=4x_{2}. Substituting these into the slope equation, we get:frac{y_{1}-y_{2}}{x_{1}-x_{2}}=frac{y_{1}-y_{2}}{frac{y_{1}^{2}-y_{2}^{2}}{4}}=-k Rightarrow k(y_{1}+y_{2})=-4Substituting this result into the equation for x_{1}+x_{2}, we find:x_{1}+x_{2}=4This shows that x_{1}+x_{2} is indeed a constant value, making statement B correct. However, the analysis does not directly prove or disprove that x_{1}x_{2} is a constant value without further algebraic manipulation, which is not provided in the original solution. Thus, based on the given solution, we cannot conclusively determine the correctness of statement C without additional information.boxed{text{Statement B is correct}}Step 3: Analyzing Statement DThe coordinates of the midpoint D are given as (2, -frac{2}{k}). The equation of line AB can be written as y+frac{2}{k}=-k(x-2). Setting y=0 to find the x-intercept, we get:x_{0}=2-frac{2}{k^{2}}Since D lies inside the parabola, we have the inequality (-frac{2}{k})^{2} < 8, which simplifies to frac{4}{k^{2}} < 8 or frac{2}{k^{2}} < 4. This implies:x_{0}=2-frac{2}{k^{2}} in (-2, 2)Therefore, statement D is correct, indicating that the x-coordinate of the intersection point of line AB with the x-axis lies within the interval (-2, 2).boxed{text{Statement D is correct}}In conclusion, the correct statements are boxed{ABD}."},{"problem":"## Task 3 - 140613A cyclist rode from A to B on a road at a constant speed.

According to the problem, the sum of the interior angles is 180^{circ} less than three times the sum of its exterior angles. Therefore, we can set up the equation as follows:[(n-2) times 180^{circ} = 3 times 360^{circ} - 180^{circ}]Simplifying the equation, we get:[180n - 360 = 1080 - 180]Further simplification gives us:[180n = 1080 - 180 + 360][180n = 1260][n = frac{1260}{180}][n = 7]Therefore, the number of sides of this polygon is boxed{7}.

Here lfloor x rfloor denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. ","solution":"1. Identify the problem and given expression:   We need to find the total number of primes ( p < 100 ) such that ( lfloor (2+sqrt{5})^p rfloor - 2^{p+1} ) is divisible by ( p ). Here, ( lfloor x rfloor ) denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to ( x ).2. Simplify the expression:   Consider the expression ( (2+sqrt{5})^p + (2-sqrt{5})^p ). Since ( 2-sqrt{5} ) is a number between 0 and 1, ( (2-sqrt{5})^p ) becomes very small as ( p ) increases. Therefore, ( lfloor (2+sqrt{5})^p rfloor ) is approximately ( (2+sqrt{5})^p + (2-sqrt{5})^p ) minus a small fraction.3. Rewrite the expression:   [   lfloor (2+sqrt{5})^p rfloor = (2+sqrt{5})^p + (2-sqrt{5})^p - epsilon   ]   where ( 0 < epsilon < 1 ).4. Subtract ( 2^{p+1} ) from the expression:   [   lfloor (2+sqrt{5})^p rfloor - 2^{p+1} = (2+sqrt{5})^p + (2-sqrt{5})^p - 2^{p+1} - epsilon   ]5. Simplify the expression modulo ( p ):   Since ( 2-sqrt{5} ) is very small, ( (2-sqrt{5})^p ) is negligible modulo ( p ). Therefore, we can approximate:   [   (2+sqrt{5})^p + (2-sqrt{5})^p approx (2+sqrt{5})^p pmod{p}   ]6. Use the binomial theorem:   [   (2+sqrt{5})^p = sum_{k=0}^{p} binom{p}{k} 2^{p-k} (sqrt{5})^k   ]   Since ( p ) is a prime, by Fermat's Little Theorem, ( 2^p equiv 2 pmod{p} ) and ( (sqrt{5})^p equiv (sqrt{5}) pmod{p} ).7. Combine the terms:   [   (2+sqrt{5})^p + (2-sqrt{5})^p = 2 sum_{i=0}^{frac{p-1}{2}} binom{p}{2i} 2^{p-2i} 5^i   ]   This simplifies to:   [   2 cdot 2^p - 2^{p+1} equiv 0 pmod{p}   ]8. Check the divisibility:   Since ( 2 cdot 2^p - 2^{p+1} equiv 0 pmod{p} ), it follows that ( p ) divides the expression for all primes ( p geq 3 ).9. Count the primes:   The primes less than 100 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

Since the value of a_{n+1} only depends on the value of a_{n}, if a_{n}-a_{m} for two different indices n and m, then the sequence is eventually periodic. So we look for the values of a_{0} for which the sequence is eventually periodic.Claim 1. If a_{n}=-1(bmod 3), then, for all m>n, a_{m} is not a perfect square. It follows that the sequence is eventually strictly increasing, so it is not eventually periodic.Proof. A square cannot be congruent to -1 modulo 3 , so a_{n}=-1(bmod 3) implies that a_{n} is not a square, therefore a_{n+1}-a_{n}+3>a_{n}. As a consequence, a_{n+1}=a_{n}=-1(bmod 3), so a_{n+1} is not a square either. By repeating the argument, we prove that, from a_{n} on, all terms of the sequence are not perfect squares and are greater than their predecessors, which completes the proof.Claim 2. If a_{n} neq-1(bmod 3) and a_{n}>9 then there is an index m>n such that a_{m}9, t is at least 3. The first square in the sequence a_{n}, a_{n}+3, a_{n}+6, ldots will be (t+1)^{2},(t+2)^{2} or (t+3)^{2}, therefore there is an index m>n such that a_{m} leqslant t+3n such that a_{m}-3.Proof. First we notice that, by the definition of the sequence, a multiple of 3 is always followed by another multiple of 3 . If a_{n} in{3,6,9} the sequence will eventually follow the periodic pattern 3,6,9,3,6,9, ldots. If a_{n}>9, let j be an index such that a, is equal to the minimum value of the set left{a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, ldotsright}. We must have a_{j} leqslant 9, otherwise we could apply Claim 2 to a_{j} and get a contradiction on the minimality hypothesis. It follows that alpha_{j} in{3,6,9}, and the proof is complete.Claim 4. If a_{n}=1(bmod 3), then there is an index m>n such that a_{m}=-1(bmod 3).Proof. In the sequence, 4 is always followed by 2=-1(bmod 3), so the claim is true for a_{n}-4. If a_{n}=7, the next terms will be 10,13,16,4,2, ldots and the claim is also true. For a_{n} geqslant 10, we again take an index j>n such that a, is equal to the minimum value of the set left{a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, ldotsright}, which by the definition of the sequence consists of non-multiples of 3 . Suppose a_{j}=1 ( bmod 3 ). Then we must have a_{j} leqslant 9 by Claim 2 and the minimality of a_{j}. It follows that a_{j} in{4,7}, so a_{m}-2j, contradicting the minimality of a_{j}. Therefore, we must have a_{j}=-1(bmod 3).It follows from the previous claims that if a_{0} is a multiple of 3 the sequence will eventually reach the periodic pattern 3,6,9,3,6,9, ldots; if a_{0}=-1(bmod 3) the sequence will be strictly increasing; and if a_{0}=1(bmod 3) the sequence will be eventually strictly increasing.So the sequence will be eventually periodic if, and only if, a_{0} is a multiple of 3 ."},{"problem":"Given a sequence {a_n} that satisfies a_1+a_2+a_3+ldots+a_{n-1}+a_n=n-a_n (ninmathbb{N}^*).(1) Prove that the sequence {a_n-1} is a geometric sequence;  (2) If n(1-a_n) leq t (ninmathbb{N}^*) holds true for all n, find the range of the real number t.","solution":"(I) Proof: Since a_1+a_2+a_3+ldots+a_{n-1}+a_n=n-a_n (ninmathbb{N}^*),  we have a_1+a_2+a_3+ldots+a_n+a_{n+1}=n+1-a_{n+1} (ninmathbb{N}^*),  Subtracting the two equations, we get: a_{n+1}=1-a_{n+1}+a_n, which can be rearranged to: a_{n+1}-1=frac{1}{2}(a_n-1),  and since a_1-1=-frac{1}{2},  the sequence {a_n-1} is a geometric sequence with the first term -frac{1}{2} and common ratio frac{1}{2}.

Additionally, we know that f(0) = 3, so substituting x = 0 into the vertex form yields 3 = a(0 - 0)^2 + k = k.

Therefore, the city with the most stable annual precipitation is city B.","solution":"To determine which statement is correct, let's analyze each option step by step:Option A: Seeing a rainbow after rain is a random event.- Rainbows occur when sunlight and rain combine in a very specific way. The physics of rainbows are well understood and predictable under the right conditions. However, whether or not we see a rainbow after rain depends on the observer's location, the position of the sun, and the presence of raindrops in the air, which can vary and thus make seeing a rainbow a random event for the observer.- Therefore, option A is correct because it accurately describes the randomness of observing a rainbow due to varying conditions.Option B: To check the various equipment before a plane takes off, a random sampling survey should be conducted.- Aircraft safety checks are critical and require thorough inspections of all equipment rather than relying on random sampling. Every part of the plane's equipment needs to be checked to ensure safety.- Thus, option B is incorrect because a comprehensive survey, not a random sampling, is necessary for aircraft safety checks.Option C: When flipping a coin 20 times, it will definitely land heads up 10 times.- The outcome of flipping a fair coin is random, and while the expected number of heads in 20 flips is indeed 10, it is not guaranteed. The actual number of heads can vary due to the randomness of each flip.- Therefore, option C is incorrect because it incorrectly asserts a definite outcome in a random event.Option D: The meteorological bureau surveyed the precipitation in two cities, A and B, over the past 5 years. The average precipitation in both cities is 800 millimeters, with variances of s_{A}^{2}=3.4 and s_{B}^{2}=4.3 respectively. Therefore, the city with the most stable annual precipitation is city B.- Variance is a measure of how spread out numbers are. A lower variance indicates that the data points tend to be closer to the mean (and to each other), suggesting more stability in the context of annual precipitation.- Given that s_{A}^{2}=3.4 and s_{B}^{2}=4.3, city A, with the lower variance, actually has the most stable annual precipitation, not city B.- Thus, option D is incorrect because it misinterprets the significance of variance in determining stability.Conclusion:After analyzing each option:- Option A is the only correct statement, as it accurately reflects the randomness of observing a rainbow.- Options B, C, and D are incorrect based on the explanations provided.Therefore, the correct answer is: boxed{A}."},{"problem":"How can you use a balance scale without weights to divide 24 kg of nails into two parts - 9 and 15 kg?#","solution":"Try to weigh out 12 kg first, then -6 kg, and then -3 kg.## SolutionWeigh out 12 kg of nails and set them aside.

Then, we can write that frac{45 + a}{10} = frac{153 - a}{28}. Solving for a yields that 1530 - 10a = 1260 + 28a, so a=frac{270}{38}=frac{135}{19}.

We see that frac{10m}{n} - 45 + frac{28m}{n} - 84 = 69, so frac{38m}{n} = 198 implies frac{m}{n} = frac{99}{19} implies boxed{118}.Solution by IlikeaposSolution 4 (centroid) (fastest way)(Sigma x_i /4, Sigma y_i /4) is the centroid, which generates (19,99), so the answer is boxed{118}.

Understanding the Hypercube and Vertex Labeling:   - The ( N )-dimensional hypercube has ( 2^N ) vertices.   - Each vertex can be represented as a binary string of length ( N ).   - The labeling function ( v(x) = sum_{k=1}^{N} x_k 2^{k-1} ) converts the binary string ( x = (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_N) ) into an integer.2. Hamiltonian Circuit:   - A Hamiltonian circuit is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex.   - We need to determine if the vertices labeled from ( 0 ) to ( n-1 ) can form such a cycle.3. Odd-Length Cycle Argument:   - Each edge in the hypercube connects two vertices whose binary representations differ by exactly one bit.   - If there were an odd-length cycle, then at least one coordinate would have to change an odd number of times, which is impossible because each coordinate must return to its original value (even number of changes).4. Induction and Construction:   - We use induction on ( N ) to show that for ( n = 2, 4, 6, 8, ldots, 2^N ), the vertices can be connected in a Hamiltonian circuit.   - Base Case: For ( N = 1 ), the hypercube is a line segment with vertices ( 0 ) and ( 1 ). The only possible ( n ) values are ( 2 ), and the vertices ( 0 ) and ( 1 ) form a Hamiltonian circuit.   - Inductive Step: Assume that for an ( (N-1) )-dimensional hypercube, the vertices labeled from ( 0 ) to ( 2^{N-1} - 1 ) can form a Hamiltonian circuit. We need to show that this holds for an ( N )-dimensional hypercube.     - Consider the ( N )-dimensional hypercube as two ( (N-1) )-dimensional hypercubes connected by edges between corresponding vertices.     - By the inductive hypothesis, each ( (N-1) )-dimensional hypercube has a Hamiltonian circuit.     - We can connect these two circuits by adding an edge between the last vertex of the first circuit and the first vertex of the second circuit, forming a Hamiltonian circuit for the ( N )-dimensional hypercube.5. Conclusion:   - The vertices labeled from ( 0 ) to ( n-1 ) can be connected through a Hamiltonian circuit if and only if ( n ) is even.   - Therefore, the values of ( n ) for which this is possible are ( n = 4, 6, 8, ldots, 2^N ).The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 4, 6, 8, ldots, 2^N } )."},{"problem":"Below is the process of Xiao Bin's simplification of fractions.

To find the value of b, we proceed as follows:1. First, we find the derivative of f(x) to determine the critical points:f'(x) = 3x^{2} + 2ax + 1.2. Since the function achieves a minimum at x=1, we use this information in two ways:   - The value of the function at x=1 is 1, so we set f(1) = 1:   1 + a + 1 + b = 1.   - The derivative at x=1 must be 0 for a minimum, so we set f'(1) = 0:   3 + 2a + 1 = 0.3. Solving these equations simultaneously gives us:   - From 3 + 2a + 1 = 0, we find 2a = -4, so a = -2.   - Substituting a = -2 into 1 + a + 1 + b = 1, we get 1 - 2 + 1 + b = 1, which simplifies to b = 1.4. Therefore, the function becomes f(x) = x^{3} - 2x^{2} + x + 1, and its derivative is f'(x) = 3x^{2} - 4x + 1.5. Setting f'(x) = 0 to find critical points, we solve 3x^{2} - 4x + 1 = 0 and find x = frac{1}{3} or x = 1.6. Analyzing the intervals determined by these critical points, we confirm that f(x) is increasing on (-infty, frac{1}{3}) and (1, +infty), and decreasing on (frac{1}{3}, 1). This confirms that f(x) indeed achieves a minimum at x=1.7.

Therefore, we exclude right-angled triangles from our investigation.We can rephrase the question as follows: what is the condition for the circle k_{m} determined by the vertices A and B of triangle ABC and its orthocenter M to pass through the center O of the inscribed circle of the triangle, or, in other words, for k_{m} to be identical to the circumcircle k_{0} of triangle ABO.One aspect that facilitates the answer is the known fact that the reflection of M over each side of the triangle lies on the circumcircle k of the triangle. This can also be stated as follows: with the vertices A and B of the inscribed triangle ABC in k fixed, and C moving along one of the arcs AB of k, M moves along the reflection k_{m} of k over the line AB (Figure 1).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_dac247744297b9b71f20g-1.jpg?height=534&width=569&top_left_y=595&top_left_x=759)Figure 1We will show, on the other hand, that with fixed A and B, and C moving as described above, O moves on a circle k_{0} (on the side of the line AB containing C), whose center F bisects the arc AB of k not containing C, and whose radius is FA=FB. Indeed, with the usual notation, the angle subtended by AB from O isdelta=180^{circ}-angle OAB-angle OBA=180^{circ}-frac{alpha+beta}{2}=90^{circ}+frac{gamma}{2},an obtuse angle, so F is on the opposite side of the line AB, on the perpendicular bisector of AB, and the angle subtended by AB from F is twice the complement of delta, which is 180^{circ}-gamma. This is only true for the position of F described above. The vertices A and B themselves, of course, cannot be O.For the purpose of our problem, k_{m} and k_{0} have a (different from A and B) common point only if k_{0} is identical to k_{m}, their radii are FA=FK=AK (where K is the center of k), FAK is an equilateral triangle, angle AKB=120^{circ}, angle ACB=60^{circ}.Conversely, it is immediately clear that this condition is also sufficient for the 4 points under consideration to lie on a circle (Figure 2).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_dac247744297b9b71f20g-1.jpg?height=642&width=678&top_left_y=1820&top_left_x=710)Figure 2Juhász Júlia (Balassagyarmat, Balassi B.

First solution. It suffices to consider the case when P and Q(not equiv 0) are relatively prime polynomials and the leading coefficient of Q equals 1 . We havex(x+2)(P(x) Q(x+1)-Q(x) P(x+1))=Q(x) Q(x+1)for infinitely many x, i.e. for every x. Thus the polynomials Q(x) and Q(x+1) divide x(x+2) Q(x+1) and x(x+2) Q(x) respectively.Therefore S(x) Q(x)=x(x+2) Q(x+1) and T(X) Q(x+1)=x(x+2) Q(x), where S and T are quadratic polynomials with leading coefficients 1 . Hence, S(x) T(x)=x^{2}(x+2)^{2}. There are three cases to be considered.Case 1. S(x)=T(x)=x(x+2). Then Q(x+1)=Q(x), i.e. Q equiv 1 and the condition of the problem shows that this is impossible.Case 2. S(x)=x^{2} and T(x)=(x+2)^{2}. Then x Q(x)=(x+2) Q(x+1). Therefore Q(1)=0 and it follows by induction that Q(n)=0 for all n in mathbb{N}. Hence Q equiv 0, a contradiction.Case 3. S(x)=(x+2)^{2} and T(x)=x^{2}. Then (x+2) Q(x)=x Q(x+1) and therefore x divides Q(x) and x+2 divides Q(x+1), i.e. x+1 divides Q(x). It follows that Q(x)=x(x+1) Q_{1}(x), where Q_{1} has leading coefficient 1 and Q_{1}(x+1)=Q(x). We conclude that Q_{1}(x)=1 and Q(x)=x(x+1). Now plugging Q(x) in (1) gives(x+2) P(x)-x P(x+1)=x+1Setting x=0 and x=-1 we obtain P(0)=frac{1}{2} and P(-1)=-frac{1}{2}. Therefore P(x)=frac{1}{2}+x+x(x+1) P_{1}(x), where P_{1} is a polynomial. Now (2) implies that P_{1}(x+1)=P(x) and therefore P_{1} is a constant.We conclude that if the polynomials P and Q are relatively prime and a_{0}=1, then Q(x)=x(x+1) and P(x)=frac{1}{2}+x+c x(x+1).Therefore the answer isQ(x)=x(x+1) R(x) text { and } P(x)=left(frac{1}{2}+x+c x(x+1)right) R(x)where R is an arbitrary nonzero polynomial and c is a constant.Second solution.

Now it is easy to conclude that Q(x)=x(x+1) R(x) and P(x)=left(frac{1}{2}+x+c x(x+1)right) R(x).Remark. One can prove in a similar manner the following assertion:Let P and Q be polynomials with real coefficients such thatfrac{P(x)}{Q(x)}-frac{P(x+1)}{Q(x+1)}=frac{1}{x(x+a)}for infinitely many x in mathbb{R}, where a is a real number.Then a in mathbb{Z} and a neq 0.

Define the sets and elements:   Let ( x_1 < x_2 < ldots < x_k ) be all the elements of ( bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i cup B_i ). Let ( d ) be the largest difference between consecutive elements of a set when arranged in descending order.2. Initial assumption:   If there exists an element ( x_i ) that belongs to exactly one of the sets, say ( A_j ), then since ( x_i notin B_r ) for all ( 1 leq r leq n ), we can select an element ( x_a in A_j cap B_1 ) and add ( x_i ) to ( B_1 ). This operation does not increase ( d ) because ( x_a in B_1 ) as well.3. Simplify the problem:   We can assume that for all ( i ), ( x_i in A_{i_1} cap B_{i_2} ) for some ( 1 leq i_1, i_2 leq n ). This means every element of the union of all sets is an element of one ( A ) set and one ( B ) set.4. Algorithm to reduce the problem:   - Step 1: If there exists some ( z in mathbb{Z}_{>0} ) such that ( z in bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i cup B_i ), ( z+1 notin bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i cup B_i ), and ( exists c > 1 ) such that ( z+c in bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i cup B_i ), then we can strictly decrease ( S = sum_{1 leq i,j leq n} |x_i - x_j| ) without increasing ( d ).   - Step 2: If ( |A_i cap B_j| > 1 ) for some ( 1 leq i, j leq n ), then we can decrease ( k ) without increasing ( d ).5. Proof of the algorithm:   - For Step 1, replacing all ( x_i > z ) by ( x_i - c + 1 ) maintains ( A_i cap A_j = emptyset ) and ( B_i cap B_j = emptyset ). This operation either does not change ( |x_i - x_j| ) or decreases it, so ( d ) is not increased and ( S ) is strictly decreased.   - For Step 2, if ( y > z ) and ( y, z in A_i cap B_j ), deleting ( y ) from all sets it is in and performing Step 1 ensures ( A_i cap B_j neq emptyset ).6. Termination of the algorithm:   The algorithm is finite because performing Step 1 or Step 2 strictly decreases ( S ), which is a non-negative integer.7. Final configuration:   When the algorithm finishes, ( x_{i+1} - x_i = 1 ) for all ( i ), and ( |A_i cap B_j| = 1 ) for all ( 1 leq i, j leq n ). This implies ( |A_i| = |B_i| = n ) for all ( 1 leq i leq n ), and the elements of the sets are ( n^2 ) consecutive integers.8.

One of two cases applies.A) Suppose the two smallest divisors p and q are prime numbers. Then the number r=(n / p+n / q)-(p+q) is also prime, and p q r=(p+q)(n-p q). Since the numbers p+q and p q are coprime, we get r=p+q, from which p=2 and n=4 q. But then, due to the choice of q, we get q=3 and n=12.B) Suppose the smallest divisors are of the form p and p^{2}, where p is a prime number. This case is analyzed similarly.Remark. It is possible that a number has only three proper divisors. Then the difference mentioned in the condition is the difference between the largest and the smallest of the proper divisors. But any number with three proper divisors is a power of a prime p^{4}, and the difference p^{3}-p cannot be a prime number.| Evaluation | Score | Content of the criterion || :---: | :---: | :--- || + | 20 | Complete solution || .+ | 16 | Minor errors || +/ 2 | 10 | Significant gaps in the solution || .- | 6 | The idea that p n q=(p+q)(n-p q) is present || - | 0 | The solution is completely incorrect/only the answer |"},{"problem":"In the sequence {a_n}, the sum of the first n terms S_n=3cdot 2^n+k.

First Derivative Calculation:   - We calculate the first derivative of f(x): f'(x) = e^{x} + cos x.2. Analysis of f'(x):   - For x in [0, +infty), we know e^{x} geqslant 1 since the exponential function is always positive and increasing.   - cos x in [-1, 1]. The minimum value of cos x is -1, which occurs at x = 2kpi + pi, where k in mathbb{N}. However, at these points, e^{x} > 1.   - Therefore, f'(x) = e^{x} + cos x > 0 for all x in [0, +infty), indicating that f(x) is monotonically increasing in this interval.3.

This gives us f'(0) = 1 and f(0) = 1 + b.   - Substituting f'(0) = e^{0} + a = 1 + a, we find a = 0.   - The point (0, 1 + b) lies on the tangent line, leading to -1 - b - 1 = 0, which simplifies to b = -2.   - Therefore, f(x) = e^{x} - 2.2.

We write: forall n in mathbb{N}^{*}, u_{n}=frac{2+frac{cos (n)}{n}}{sin left(frac{1}{n}right)+sqrt{left(1+frac{1}{n}right)left(1+frac{2}{n}right)}}.Since we have: lim _{n rightarrow+infty} frac{cos (n)}{n}=0, lim _{n rightarrow+infty} sin left(frac{1}{n}right)=0 and lim _{n rightarrow+infty} sqrt{left(1+frac{1}{n}right)left(1+frac{2}{n}right)}=1, we deduce that the sequence left(u_{n}right) converges to 2.Definition 6. Given a sequence left(u_{n}right), we call the supremum and infimum of left(u_{n}right) the quantities, if they exist: sup left{u_{n}, n in mathbb{N}right} and inf left{u_{n}, n in mathbb{N}right}. The supremum, if it exists, of the set left{u_{n}, n in mathbb{N}right} is the smallest of the upper bounds of this set, and its infimum, if it exists, is the largest of the lower bounds of this set.Remark. Every non-empty and bounded above (resp. bounded below) subset of mathbb{R} has a finite supremum (resp. a finite infimum).Theorem 2.1. Every increasing and bounded above sequence converges to its supremum.2. Every increasing and unbounded above sequence tends to +infty.3. Every decreasing and bounded below sequence converges to its infimum.4. Every decreasing and unbounded below sequence tends to -infty.## Proof.1. Let left(u_{n}right) be an increasing and bounded above sequence.The set left{u_{n}, n in mathbb{N}right} subset mathbb{R} is bounded above, so it has a finite supremum, which we denote by ell. Since ell is the smallest of the upper bounds of the sequence left(u_{n}right), for all varepsilon>0, ell-varepsilon is not an upper bound of the sequence left(u_{n}right), so there exists N_{varepsilon} in mathbb{N} such that: u_{N_{varepsilon}}>ell-varepsilon. Furthermore, the sequence left(u_{n}right) is increasing, so forall n geq N_{varepsilon}, u_{n} geq u_{N_{varepsilon}}. We finally have, forall varepsilon>0, exists N_{varepsilon} in mathbb{N}, forall n geq N_{varepsilon}, ell-varepsilon < u_{n} leq ell.The sequence left(v_{n}right) is increasing, so forall n geq n_{0}, v_{n} geq v_{n_{0}} and thus forall n geq n_{0}, v_{n}>A. This proves that the sequence left(v_{n}right) tends to +infty. Points 3 and 4 are proven by applying points 1 and 2 and are left as exercises.Definition 7. Let left(u_{n}right) and left(v_{n}right) be two real sequences. We say that the sequences left(u_{n}right) and left(v_{n}right) are adjacent if:1. left(u_{n}right) is increasing.2. left(v_{n}right) is decreasing.3. lim _{n rightarrow+infty}left(v_{n}-u_{n}right)=0.Property 2. Two adjacent sequences converge to the same limit.Proof. left(u_{n}right) is increasing and left(v_{n}right) is decreasing, so the sequence left(v_{n}-u_{n}right) is decreasing. Furthermore, the sequence left(v_{n}-u_{n}right) converges to 0, so forall n in mathbb{N}, v_{n}-u_{n} geq 0. Therefore, we have: u_{0} leq u_{n} leq v_{n} leq v_{0}.The sequence left(u_{n}right) is increasing and bounded above by v_{0}, so it converges, and the sequence left(v_{n}right) is decreasing and bounded below by u_{0}, so it converges. Since lim _{n rightarrow+infty}left(v_{n}-u_{n}right)=0, we have: lim _{n rightarrow+infty} u_{n}=lim _{n rightarrow+infty} v_{n}."},{"problem":"2.

If c_{1} is odd, then n_{2}=n_{1}+c_{1} is even, and we have only written one odd number. Note also that c_{1} cannot be equal to 0.If c_{1}=2, then d_{1}=1. We have n_{2}=n_{1}+2, so c_{2}=3 and d_{2}=3, and n_{3}=n_{2}+3 is even. The third number written is therefore even.If c_{1}=4, then d_{1} can be 1 or 3. If d_{1}=1, then n_{2}=n_{1}+4 so c_{2}=5 and d_{2}=5, so n_{3}=n_{2}+5 is even.

In the second case n_{3} is even, and in the first we are reduced to the previous case left(c=8, d=1right) so n_{4} is even.- if d_{1}=5, then d_{2}=3 and c_{2} can be 8 or 9.

Give the explicit way to find these groups by performing two weightings on a regular balance.","solution":"To solve the problem of dividing the six pieces of cheese into two groups of equal weight using only two weighings on a regular balance, we can follow these steps:1. Define Majorization:   - Call a decreasing sequence (a, b, c) to *majorize* another decreasing sequence (d, e, f) if (a > d), (b > e), and (c > f). This implies that (a + b + c > d + e + f), and thus their sums are not equal.2. List Possible Groupings:   - Suppose the pieces are labeled from heaviest to lightest as (6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1). We need to find a grouping of three pieces each such that their sums are equal. We will consider the group containing the heaviest piece, (6), and check all possible combinations:     - (6, 5, 4) majorizes (3, 2, 1), so this is impossible.     - (6, 5, 3) majorizes (4, 2, 1), so this is impossible.     - (6, 5, 2) majorizes (4, 3, 1), so this is impossible.     - (6, 5, 1) does not majorize (4, 3, 2). For example, setting (6 = 100) kg, (5 = 99) kg, (4 = 98) kg, (3 = 97) kg, (2 = 85) kg, (1 = 81) kg, we obtain two groups that sum to (200) kg each.     - (6, 4, 3) majorizes (5, 2, 1), so this is impossible.     - (6, 4, 2) majorizes (5, 3, 1), so this is impossible.     - (6, 4, 1) does not majorize (5, 3, 2). For example, setting (6 = 100) kg, (5 = 99) kg, (4 = 98) kg, (3 = 97) kg, (2 = 83) kg, (1 = 81) kg, we obtain two groups that sum to (200) kg each.     - (6, 3, 2) does not majorize (5, 4, 1).

For example, setting (6 = 100) kg, (5 = 98) kg, (4 = 97) kg, (3 = 96) kg, (2 = 82) kg, (1 = 81) kg, we obtain two groups that sum to (200) kg each.     - (6, 2, 1) does not majorize (5, 4, 3).

Perform Two Weighings:   - Weigh (6, 4, 1) vs (5, 3, 2) and (6, 3, 1) vs (5, 4, 2). If either of these weighings balance, we have found the correct grouping. If not, analyze the results:     - If (6, 4, 1) is heavier and (6, 3, 1) is heavier, then the correct grouping is (6, 2, 1) vs (5, 4, 3).     - If (6, 4, 1) is lighter and (6, 3, 1) is lighter, then the correct grouping is (6, 5, 1) vs (4, 3, 2).     - If (6, 4, 1) is lighter and (6, 3, 1) is heavier, this is impossible as moving the (4) from the lighter side with the (3) shouldn't make the lighter side suddenly heavier.     - If (6, 4, 1) is heavier and (6, 3, 1) is lighter, then the correct grouping is (6, 3, 2) vs (5, 4, 1).The final answer is ( boxed{ 6, 5, 1 } ) vs (4, 3, 2), (6, 4, 1) vs (5, 3, 2), (6, 3, 1) vs (5, 4, 2), (6, 2, 1) vs (5, 4, 3), or (6, 3, 2) vs (5, 4, 1)."},{"problem":"In triangle A B C, letbegin{array}{l}x=cos A+cos B+cos C, y=sin frac{A}{2}+sin frac{B}{2}+sin frac{C}{2} .end{array}Then the relationship between x and y is ( ).(A) x=y(B) x geqslant y(C) x leqslant y(D) cannot be determined","solution":"5.C.From the conditions, we havebegin{array}{l}cos A+cos B=2 cos frac{pi-C}{2} cdot cos frac{A-B}{2} =2 sin frac{C}{2} cdot cos frac{A-B}{2} leqslant 2 sin frac{C}{2} .end{array}Similarly, cos B+cos C leqslant 2 sin frac{A}{2},cos C+cos A leqslant 2 sin frac{B}{2} text {. }Therefore, x leqslant y."},{"problem":"Given that the radius of the Earth is 6371 kilometers, Shanghai is located at approximately east longitude 121^{circ}, north latitude 31^{circ}, and Taipei is located at approximately east longitude 121^{circ}, north latitude 25^{circ}.

The total number of cookies eaten each day is the same. In total, Seryozha ate 264+187=451=11 cdot 41 cookies.

If we \\"reverse\\" the sequence of the number of chocolate cookies, while leaving the sugar-free cookies unchanged, the total number of cookies will not change, but the difference between the number of chocolate cookies and sugar-free cookies eaten each day will become constant. Since 264-187=77=7 cdot 11, the proper diet lasted either 7, 11, or 77 days.

Let's denote the 2011 distinct positive integers as (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2011}) where (a_1 < a_2 < ldots < a_{2011}).2. The smallest possible sum of these 2011 integers is (1 + 2 + ldots + 2011).

If an enterprise has an output value of 1,000,000 RMB and is eligible for a 90,000 RMB bonus, analyze whether the function y=log x + kx + 5 (where k is a constant) is in line with the government's reward requirements, and explain why (given log 2 approx 0.3, log 5 approx 0.7).2.

Therefore, the function becomes y = log x + frac{x}{50} + 5.Examining y = log x + frac{x}{50} + 5 for x in [50, 500], we observe that it is an increasing function, as expected. However, when x = 50, we calculate f(50) = log 50 + 6, which we can analyze using the rough logarithm values given:f(50) = log (2*5^2) + 6 = log 2 + 2log 5 + 6 approx 0.3 + 2*0.7 + 6 = 7.7,which is greater than 7.5 (15% of 50). Therefore, it violates the rule that the bonus should not exceed 15% of the annual output value. Hence, the function model y = log x + frac{x}{50} + 5 does not meet the government's requirements because the bonus exceeds the prescribed percentage cap.For the function f(x) = frac{15x - a}{x + 8}, we can rewrite it as f(x) = 15 - frac{120 + a}{x + 8} to better analyze its behavior. For f(x) to be increasing within x in [50, 500], and to maintain f(x) geq 7 at its minimum point (which occurs at x = 50), we can set up the inequality:f(50) = 15 - frac{120 + a}{50 + 8} geq 7.Solving for a, we get a leq 344. This ensures that the minimum bonus is not less than 700,000 RMB.To ensure that f(x) leq 0.15x for x in [50, 500], we establish that a must be greater than or equal to the minimum value of -0.15x^2 + 13.8x in the interval.

What is the smallest number of times a positive temperature could have been announced?","solution":"Answer: 3Solution: When solving, we will not consider cities with a zero temperature, as no positive or negative numbers appear when interacting with them.1) Let there be x participants at the conference, each giving x-1 answers, so x(x-1)=48+62, which means x=11.2) Let there be y people with \\"positive temperature\\" at the conference, then there were (11-y) people with \\"negative temperature\\". Each \\"positive\\" person recorded a positive number (y-1) times, and each \\"negative\\" person recorded a negative number -(10-y) times. Then y(y-1)+(11-y)(10-y)=62 Rightarrow y^{2}-11 y+24=0 Rightarrow y=3 or y=8. Both obtained answers satisfy the condition (in both cases, 48 negative numbers are recorded)."},{"problem":"Let frac{2010}{x^{3}}=frac{2011}{y^{3}}=frac{2012}{z^{3}}, x y z>0,andbegin{array}{l}sqrt[3]{frac{2010}{x^{2}}+frac{2011}{y^{2}}+frac{2012}{z^{2}}} =sqrt[3]{2010}+sqrt[3]{2011}+sqrt[3]{2012} .end{array}Find the value of x+y+z.","solution":"Let frac{2010}{x^{3}}=frac{2011}{y^{3}}=frac{2012}{z^{3}}=k, obviously k neq 0.Then 2010=x^{3} k, 2011=y^{3} k, 2012=z^{3} k.From the given, we havesqrt[3]{x k+y k+z k}=sqrt[3]{x^{3} k}+sqrt[3]{y^{3} k}+sqrt[3]{z^{3} k},which means sqrt[3]{k} sqrt[3]{x+y+z}=sqrt[3]{k}(x+y+z).Since k neq 0, we have sqrt[3]{x+y+z}=x+y+z.Given that x>0, y>0, z>0.Therefore, x+y+z=1."},{"problem":"Among the following options, which one is not an algebraic expression?A. -5frac{5}{7}B. 3x-2y-1C. ab=baD. frac{s}{v}","solution":"An algebraic expression is a combination of numbers, operations, and variables (letters representing numbers) that defines a particular quantity. Let's examine each option:A. -5frac{5}{7} is a numerical value, which is considered an algebraic expression since it can be represented as a fraction.B. 3x-2y-1 is an algebraic expression as it involves variables x and y, numbers, and the operations of multiplication and subtraction.C. ab=ba is an equation stating a property (commutative property of multiplication) rather than expressing a specific quantity or operation, hence it is not an algebraic expression.D. frac{s}{v} represents the operation of division applied to the variables s and v, making it an algebraic expression.Since C does not qualify as an algebraic expression but an equation, the correct answer is:[boxed{C}]"},{"problem":"Given vectors |vec{a}|=5, |vec{b}|=4, if the angle between vec{a} and vec{b} is 120^{circ}, then the projection of vector vec{b} in the direction of vector vec{a} is ______.","solution":"AnalysisThis question mainly examines the concept of the projection of vectors.
