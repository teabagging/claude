So lower part appears more white and accentuated.  Blood vessels with bronchi thus becomes more prominent in lower part and termed as accentuated bronchovascular markings.About uper lobe pleural thickening,  it is seen in old age and in old TB or pneumonia lesion.Since the pleura is thickened it suggest old fibrotic lesion.So no ned to worry about this x ray report."},{"Patient":"I ve received results of a ct scan.

I also have a numbness under my heart and pain accross from that.","Doctor":"Hi, thank you for asking Healthcare magic.With this presentation, I think it is a case of peptic ulcer disease. The pain results from irritation of the stomach walls by acid secretions. I would suggest you try an antacid and some other drug like cimetidine, ranitidine or omeprazole for at least two weeks.I hope that helps.I wish you well"},{"Patient":"During intercourse I have had fluid in my lungs 3 times and today I quit before it got bad.

Advice?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you should avoid heavy exertion and take rest at home. Get done TMT (Trade Mill Test) first to rule out cardiac cause.There are many causes for fluid in lungs but when it is due to cardiac cause, we call it as pulmonary edema.So we need to rule out cardiac causes first. I advice you to get done 2D Echo also for evaluation of heart function. As decreased heart function lead to pulmonary edema."},{"Patient":"I am suppose to be taking my blood pressure medicine,but I forgot 2 days in a row now.I just remembered and was like Oh my god!

Now it appears that he may also have sleep apnea and is about to spend a night at a hospital to determine that. What might be the connection between the two conditions and would healing or lessening one help with healing or lessening the other?","Doctor":"There is no connection between these 2 disorders. I am a Pulmonologist. Costochondritis is very annoying but benign....It will disturb u but will not do a harm..The best u can do- avoid exposure to cold, motorcycle riding, use NSAIDs for acute chest pain.For sleep apnea, do an overnight Polysomnography. An AHI> 30 in this study needs to be treated with a CPAP machine.

I am a 22 year old woman and, after drinking a glass of milk, I ve been hit with a bout of moderate chest pain and some pain/sharpness when taking in a deep breath of air. I do suffer from acid reflux and IBS so heartburn and indigestion is no unusual for me but it is particularly potent and long lasting here. Could this be an allergy/intolerance to lactose? Or is it related to acid reflux?","Doctor":"Thanks for question on HCM.In my opinion it is acid reflux only. As lactose intolerance cause diarrhoea first.And for acid reflux try to follow all these simultaneously for better control.1. Avoid oily, spicy and hot food.2. Avoid stress and tension.3.

PGI in India ... is it good for such surgeries?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Your father is ideal candidate for CABG (Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting). Any patient with triple vessel disease should go for CABG. So you must get done CABG.In this procedure the blocked arteries are bypassed by veins or arteries. Veins used are anterior tibial vein, popleteal vein. And the best is internal mammilary artery. It is now considered as less risky procedure as more and more expertise has been achieved.  So you should not worry much.And PGI is good institute. So get done there.

If you had tb and took the treatment,  healing has to occur. And in lungs healing occur by 1. Fibrosis2. Calcification3. Bronchiectasis4. Rarely complete resolution. Fibrosis and calcification are seen more commonly.  And on chedt x ray it gives appearance of fibrotic scar tissue. So one can not comment on these x ray lesions whethrr they are active or inactive. So report  has been mentioned like undetermined activity.You need sputum examination and bronchoscopy with BAL (BronchoAlveolar Lavage) analysis for TB for confirmation about your lesion whether it is active or inactive.

Radiation pneumonitis. 2. Infective etiology3. Malignant spread itself.In my opinion it seems radiation pneumonitis more. As it is seen immediately after radiotherapy due to inflammation in lung.Since your lung defence has been lowered possibility of infection is always there.So better to undergo CT Thirax and if needed bronchoscopy and BAL (BronchoAlveolar Lavage) analysis."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor I ve had chest pains on Tuesday evening and I didn t do nothing mainly because I thought it will fade dyeing the night and then today since I got up I ve been left with pain in the left side and its going into my back and Ribs ,what can this be cos I m a diabetic and I have asma","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you should immediately go to the Emergency Room and get done ECG to rule out cardiac cause.Because your symptoms are classical of anginal pain. Plus you are diabetic which makes you more prone to heart diseaese.So I advice you to rush to the ER and get done ECG and 2D Echo.

Due to this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms.  GERD causes more trouble with oily food. So try to follow these for better control of GERD.1. Avoid oily, spicy and hot food.2. Avoid stress and anxiety. 3. Try to loose some weight as obesity worsens GERD.4. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 5.

Fuzziness on chest x ray means infiltration. This is seen commonly in lung infection. So it is due to infection and inflammation so known as pneumonitis.

Chest x ray 2. PFT (Pulmonary Function Test)Since you are smoker we need to rule out bronchitis first. So PFT is needed. Chest x ray is needed to rule out any infection like TB present or not.And quit smoking as soon as possible.Chances of MDR TB is very low in your case as you had extra pulmonary (pericardial) TB. MDR in extra pulmonary cases is very low. It is more seen in pulmonary TB patients.

And it is theophyllin group of drug.Its action starts only after 30-40 minutes as it is oral drug. So action starts after atleast 30 minutes.

(I went to the doctor two days ago and am working on the bronchitis now.) This morning when I peed, I noticed a little burning at the end of urination. Then for a little while I felt like I really had to pee again right away. But little pee came out. The next time I peed there was a little pink on the toilet paper. Then I looked in the toilet and saw a small red discharge, kind of like I used to see when I had my period. I haven t bled since end of menopause. Could the extreme coughing have caused a tear in something? Please help me not to freak out.

What does it mean? thanks.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In noral chest x ray PA view, the apical part of lung is overlapped (hidden) by bony structures like 1st two ribs and clavicle.So the lesion present on apex is not visualised clearly.So we need apicolordotic view.in this view x ray is taken in such a way that bony structures are not going to obstruct the apex. So apex will be clearly visualised and lesion can be identified. And spot film means taking x ray only of interested region. In your case It is left mid and lower part. So in simple words it is the magnifying image of only left mid and lower part. This will give magnified view and so better reporting can be done."},{"Patient":"Not sure what all this means but this is what the xray says: FINDINGS Left chest port is again seen.

Bronchoscopy and BAL (Broncho Alveolar Lavage) analysis for AFB.So if both are negative than you can prove that you are not having active TB and not infectious. So you can assure visa authority about not having TB."},{"Patient":"The palpitations I experience was diagnosed as PVC s & told it d nothing to worry about. That was a few months ago. My symptoms are at times very distracting & uncomfortable, it actually feels like my chest is shivering (not cold), like inside tremors. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion youneed to get done ECG again. As PVC (Premature Ventricular Contraction) can lead to arrhythmia sometimes. If ECG is normal than go for holter monitoring. Holter monitoring is 24 hour continuous recording of ECG. So we can easily picked the rhythm abnormality. If this is also normal than no need to worry about cardiac cause.You should get done CBC and TSH Level to rule out anemia and thyroid problems as they may also cause similar symptoms. If all these are normal than your symptoms are mostly due to anxiety. So better to consult psychiatrist and start treatment."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have had pneumonia for a number of weeks now & am on my 3rd round of antibiotics. Although I am feeling a lot better I still get very tired & am experiencing a lot of discomfort in my chest around my right arm pit. The x-ray showed the left lung was most infected. Is this something I should be concerned about or just continue to ride it out? Thanks you","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you should get done repeat chest x ray to see whether1. The lesion is improving2. The lesion is static3. The lesion is worsening.In pneumonia identification of causative organism is very important , so that we can give proper antibiotics. So if your lesion is improving than no need to worry. But if it is static or worsening than get done CT Thorax and Bronchoscopy with BAL (BronchAlveolar Lavage) analysis for culture and sensitivity. By doing these we can start the specific therapy and titrate antibiotics too."},{"Patient":"i have been taking tb medication for 3 weeks now for the first two weeks i fellt much better but this past week i have a teerible pain in my right side of the chest or its the lung idont know is it normal.

Levels have normalized and pain still getting worse. I also have chest pain and swollen sore lynmnodes in armpit. Should I be worried?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Since you had taken prednisone tablet chances of infections are high. Prednisone is oral steroid and it is immunosuppressive in nature. So chances of infection are high when you are on prednisone.

I have been a vegetarian my whole life, cholesterol 140, BP usually 110/70. I do have problems with heart palpitations, but my question is about right quadrant pain that I ve been having for about 3 yrs. It radiates to back, it s a gnawing, chronic pain. I feel nauseous, and just generally ill. I ve had barium swallow, endoscopy, hida scan, 2 ultrasounds- all normal. A few weeks ago my primary ordered a CT scan. He called and said my gallbladder is good, but my right kidney shows possible stone, so he referred me to the urologist, who said my right kidney looks swollen and possible stone in ureter. Sent me straight back over to hospital for a urn CT scan (lots of radiation), but he said he felt it was necessary. Nurse called me with results- right kidney is fine, cyst on left kidney, cyst on right ovary, what they thought was a stone is calcifications in ureter. Then she casually mentions there was some mild fatty deposits on liver. I freaked. She said oh everyone says that, but it s no big deal. Followed ip with primary, and I was grilling him about this fatty liver thing. He said, it s mild and wouldn t be the cause of my pain. So I m back at square one, only now I m freaked thinking I have a fat on my liver. First ultrasound I had done the tech said, beautiful liver ....second one I had done just a month before CT scan, and everything looked great. Are Ct scans better at detecting those types of things? Both scans were with and without contrast. I m a wine drinker, but just couple times a week, or sometimes it s twice a month. I do drink more than the moderate 2 glasses, but I don t know anyone who does that. Bilirubin- 0.4, ALT- 15, AST- 16 Blood work normal. Sorry so long, but how serious is mild fatty infiltration of the liver?? How long will it take to repair if I abstain from alcohol? And can the mild fatty liver cause this pain and sick feeling? I still have no answers, but I would like feedback on the liver results and if cysts on kidneys are normal. My doctor just prescribed Zoloft and sent me on my way.....which isn t helping anything,so frustrated.","Doctor":"fatty liver is common problem and treatment include low fat, sugar diet and regular exercise. you should avoid alcohol. It may not resolve completely but it's not a matter of worry. As fat deposits in the belly, similarly fat deposits in liver.It should not lead to pain and this illness.Now about your pain, is there any relationship with meal, any relieving or aggravating factors, any associated symptoms."},{"Patient":"My sister got coughing at night in June then blood clots come out through vomiting.. all the reports like x-ray, blood report got typhoid…in august she did not continues the medicine as she was felling better… but at the ending of august month she found out normal coughing proble especiall in the evening and morning… now again she x-rayed and find out that fibronudlar opacities…what does it mean of fibronudalar opacities?

And it is spread by blood. So practically affect any organ of the body. So pleural metastases can be sedn in such malignant lesion.And lungs and pleura are considered different organs in cancer spread.  So malignant pleural effusion does not always suggest lung involvement.

He had a procedure last week (like a few days after the initial finding ) and had that repaired/stented I believe. Another test he had done with this new primary showed two spots on his one lung (one spot was on a lymph node?). It was pretty large. He has to wait to be released from the vascular surgeon to have a biopsy on his lung. He is scared to death obviously (and quit smoking this week).

Are any of the treatment effective that can reduce the clots and prolong his life?help","Doctor":"Thanks for ypur question on HCM.Your father is having pulmonary embolism And the most vommon cause is Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) of large veins of leg.So from this veins clot dislodges and travel in blood and reaches heart (right sided). From heart clot reaches pulmonary arteries and due to small diameter of these vessels they stuck their. By this they hamper the blood supply of lung and cause the symptoms. And surgery is indicated only in chronic large emboli. Not in acute cases. Fibrinolytic therapy is needed to dissolve the clot. And long term treatment with warfarrin is needed.And fibrinolytic therapy is very effecting in prolonging life in pulmonary embolism."},{"Patient":"res sir, i m having severe cough with mild sputum, having previous history of asthmatic symptoms, right now i cant able to breathe properly , i am felling my chest was stiff during inspiration, i done PFT , in that it shows restrictive pattern, in that my fvc was 39% fev1 was 36% and fvc/fev1 ratio was 100% in pre broncho dialator and in post broncho dialator test it shows fvc 62% and fev1 51%. so what to do now, can i use combimist l respules through nebulizer.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you are having asthma. As PFT shows clear cut improvement in post bronchodilator test. And this improvement is the diagnostic feature for asthma.And combimist l is having levosalbutamol and ipratropium. And both are bronchodilator. So you should definitely take this. This will give you symptomatic  relief .But you should consult pulmonologist and start maintainance treatment for asthma to prevent such attacks.So take combimist l and get appointment of pulmonologist for maintenance treatment."},{"Patient":"My husband had a cortisone shot in his right hip three days ago and now for two or three days he has gone into hiccups and I understand this could be a side effect of the shot. Is that true, and since we have not had success totally by giving honey, sugar on the tongue or swallowing ice chips, what can I do to get these stopped. Thanks for your help. Mrs. S.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Hiccups has no specific cause.But the most widely approved theory is irritation to phrenic nerve. Others are dehydration, pharyngitis etc.Treatment is also not specified anywhere.Drink plenty of fluids, keep yourself hydrated.Take antihistamines. Beclifen is the drug commonly used in hiccups. So you can try this beclofen if hydration does not give you relief."},{"Patient":"I had previously experienced my chest pop when I stretched after staying in the same position for a long time(doing coursework)however recently, when sleeping, I have a sensation that my chest would pop if I stretch but it didn t pop and only hurt and the uncomfortable pain doesn t fade away.

I don t know what the problem is and i m worried that this could lead to serious problem. Please help.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion it is muscular pain only due to stretching. But as a rule in chest pain, we need to rule out cardiac cause first.So please get done ECG.If it is normal than it must be muscular pain only.Try to follow these for muscular pain.1. Avoid strenuous exercise. 2. Avoid heavy weight lifting.3. Avoid bad postures in bed.4. Take pain killers and muscle relaxant. 5. Apply warm water to the affected site."},{"Patient":"I have been diagnosed with mild splenomegaly with ap span of 14.5 cm, and a 2 mm nodule in the left lower lobe and minimal linear atelectasis or fibrosis within the right middle lobe. A 2mm left lower lobe nodule. Please explain what this means, thanks in advance :))","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I want to ask you few questions.1. What symptoms you have?2. Are you having any respiratory symptoms?3. Are you smoker And alcoholic?4. Is there any past history of TB or pneumonia? Mild spleenomegaly can be seen in alcoholics. It can be a normal finding in individual too. Or seen in gastrointestinal infection. So no need to worry much for mild spleenomegaly.For your CT findings of lung, no need to worry. As linear atelectesia and fibrosis is seen in old infection. 3 mm nodule in keft lung is also due to old infection. So if you are asymptotic for chest than no need to worry for this finding. I advice to repeat CT thorax after 6 months and if findings are similar than no need for further CT as it is inactive lesion only."},{"Patient":"My doctor prescribed me sulfamethox for sebaceous cyst on my chest. The cyst is very sore, red, & irritated. It also has terrible odor from the area, but there isn t any discharge from it. I really want it surgically removed. Will the sulfamethox help with the cyst?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you should start combination of amoxycillin and clavulanic acid. As it is having excellent effect on skin infection.And along with this you need to take painkiller and anti inflammatory drugs. As redness suggest inflammation. Anti histamine if you are having itch.Surgery is needed only if you are not getting response by oral drugs.So start the above mentioned treatment.  Keep that part dry. If not improved in 5 days than you can think of surgery."},{"Patient":"My girlfriend is experiencing an increased heart rate for a few moments around lunchtime and some general chest pain near her shoulder on the right side, which hurts to press hard on. She's also feeling some intermittent stabbing/numb pains in her right arm. She has Haemophilia C and has was diagnosed with anemia as a child. She has recently been using one crutch for a damaged tendon in her right foot (but switched arms regularly), but has stopped now after ~3 weeks of use. She is also 2 months into a desk job, when she used to work in retail. She saw her GP a few days ago, who tested blood pressure and listened for heart arrythmias but found nothing abnormal. She has considered ibuprofen, but was warned off it due to the Haemophilia. She has cut down her consumption of Coke Zero, coffee and seldom has alcohol, but after 5 days is still experiencing the symptoms above. She's thinking of getting some light exercise on a rowing machine, but I think she's worried about exacerbating it. Please can you offer any advice?","Doctor":"doesn't look like a heart pain as pressure increases right arm pain. Arm pain can occur due to bleeding occurring in muscle or joint.  Palpitations can occur due to anemia. Get  peripheral smear  done followed by serum iron studies if needed to look for cause of anemia. factor 8 level should be checked once to know the status of hemophilia"},{"Patient":"I have severe Chest congestion, iam a bronchial asthmatic patient, I use nebulizer with duolin to relieve the congestion ,I experience shortness of breath early in the morning.

And infections are the most common cause for this.Better to visit Emergency department , as we need to check oxygen level. If low than you may need supplemental oxygen therapy.Chest x ray is akso needed. And if infective patch is there than we need to start parenteral antibiotics. You may need corticosteroid injection also. As they are potent anti inflammatory drugs and treatment of choice in asthma attack. Injectable bronchodilators like theophyllin group is also useful.So don't wait at hone, rush to the emergency department and start the treatment."},{"Patient":"Hi i m suffering from jaundice HEV since 1 month and now the bilirubin is 2.5 and also quit smoking since the day jaundice started.

Doctor has checked me told ur heart and chest are fine and I have not done any x- ray. Why this negative thoughts comes in mind? This is only when i m alone.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist first and get done chest x ray and pulmonary function test (PFT) to rule out COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease).As you are smoker and having breathing issues, likelyhood of COPD is more. Untreated COPD also gives psychological symptoms like depression. So your negative symptoms might be due to COPD. Since you are recently recovered from illness, this may also give psychiatric symptoms. So better to discuss all these with your psychiatrist."},{"Patient":"The last 2 week s I smoked cigarettes, I experienced very intense heart palpitations that lasted about 5 minutes. My heart raced and my body was flushed of all energy and had tingling/numbness throughout my Whole body. Also the last 2 weeks of smoking I had extreme sharp shooting pains in my chest - mostly heart area. This happened every time I inhaled. So is there something to worry about? What tests should I have done? My EKG came up normal except for a slow heart beat. I am set up to have chest xray and blood work done.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion first of all you should quit smoking. As smoking is the cause for your symptoms. It causes sympathetic overactivity and this causes high pulse rate, sweating, uneasiness etc.And yes you should definitely get done chest x ray to rule out pleurisy (inflammation of Pleura). As pain on inspiration is seen in pleurisy. Sometimes anxiety and nervousness can also cause similar pain.So quit smoking and get done chest x ray and blood reports."},{"Patient":"HiI had a sexual intercourse with a woman..I used condom. .... but unfortunate kiss happened....Is der anything to worry abt it. ...It happened 4days back. ..

URTI can cause by virus and bacteria and can spread by kissing.So you may got infection due to kissing.No need to worry much.Try to follow these for URTI.1. Avoid oily and spicy food.2. Drink plenty of fluids. Keep yourself hydrated.3. Take quinolone group of antibiotic. 4. Also take anti inflammatory and antihistamines. 5. Warm saline gargles 5-6 times a day.If not improve in 5 days than get done chest x ray to rule out lower respiratory tract infection.

As smoking does not cause external skin damage. It causes internal body damage.So the lesion is something else. May be some minor trauma caused this bruise.So better to get done dressing.And ask your friend to quit smoking and drinking alcohol.It is not a good for health."},{"Patient":"I smoked for 30 years and then stopped for 4 years.

However, sometimes in the morning when I wake up I can hear my lungs when I attempt to cough. My back also hurts. I know I need to stop smoking, but is this a sign of copd or cancer?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you should get done some investigations like chest x ray and Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) to rule out COPD and cancer.As smoking causes both and symptoms like shortness of breath is also seen in both. Back pain is mostly due to weakness and again it is seen in both.So we need to get done basic investigations.In my opinion chances of COPD are more in your case. So get done chest x ray and PFT for the diagnosis of COPD.And auit smoking as soon as possible."},{"Patient":"i m feeling shortness of breath for 2 weeks and acidity problem also which makes me burp all the time. i had gone through gall bladder removal surgery. my main concern is difficulty in breathing..recently x-ray was done which shows accentuation of BV markings in both the lungs..doc prescribed my rynazma tab, Normaxin capsules, Digene syrup..what is the problem","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you should not worry about accentuated lung marking. As it is the normal finding on chest x ray. It is due to gravity dependent high blood flow in the lung bases. So blood circulation is more in bases and this appears more white on chest x ray. So accentuated bronchovascular markings are seen.No need to worry for this.I advice Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) to rule out bronchitis as a cause for your breathing difficulty. And bronchitis gives appearance of prominent BV markings too.So better to consult pulmonologist and get done PFT."},{"Patient":"I have a tickling sensation (no pain) in my chest that comes and goes. I feel it in the upper left part of my chest close to my armpit. This has been happening for approximately the last week. It feels somewhat like fluttering, but it seems to be occurring up and to the left of the atrium. I am scheduled for a holter monitor and echocardiogram next week but am obviously very curious in the mean time.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you are having irregular heart beats ( arrhythmia ) which give you feeling of fluttering. So you must get done 1. Holter monitoring2. 2D ECHOHolter monitoring is continuous recording of your ECG through out the day. So any rhythm abnormality can be easily picked up.2D Echo is needed to see any wall motion abnormality  and the function of heart.So go and get all these done.Till that time avoid heavy working."},{"Patient":"my sister has copd and emphasima on her way to the doctor she collapsed and her heart stopped it took 7 min.to start her heart. all the tests are showing no brain damage but when they reduce her medication dopamine for b.p. and propofol to keep her in a comma state when they lowered the med. doses she had a seizure will she ever be able to breath on her own again","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.The gap of 7 minutes to achieve heart function is too crucial.  And brain damage is definitely there as time is 7 minutes.In body ,brain regulates everything. Blood pressure, heart rate, breathing etc.So I think your sister is having hypoxic brain damage as in that 7 minutes, blood supply of brain might be zero and so thete may be brain damage.other evidences which favours brain damage are1. Seizure episodes if we decreade propofol2. Fall in BP aswe decrease dopamin.So better to get done EEG (Electro Enceohalo Gram) and CNC examination.If EEG is not showing any brain activity thsn chances of survival are very very low."},{"Patient":"I had knee surgery back in February, the inflammation and swelling have not gone away.

As coughing will remove it from wind pipe.But if you are having symptoms like1. Chest pain2. Fever with expextoration3. Shortness of breathThan you should definitely get done bronchoscopy.As chances of popcorn in trachea is high if you develop these symptoms. Otherwise no need to worry.

Atelectesis is partial collapse of alveoli. It is most commonly due to secretions. And secretions are due to infection.So infection is the cause for your Atelectesis.  Carinal lymphnodes are also enlarged due to this infection.Bronchiectasis is airway disease. In which bronchi became dilated and tortuous. This causes retention of secretions and this retained secretion cause infection.So start antibiotics as your CT report shows sequelae of infection."},{"Patient":"Sir I have coughing since last 8 months.

She has since been moved to the ICU and is now on life support for both her heart and lungs. As for prior health problems, my mother has also been a smoker for about 45 years and regularly uses Ventilin for sudden shortness of breath. At the moment they say that her condition could either improve or significantly worsen within the next several days, but I will have no peace of mind until I know with some certainty what will happen to her. Could someone provide me with a second opinion, or else any other way that I could somehow obtain a better picture of her health?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.By your history ,In my opinion your mother is having Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in the past. And ventorlin inhaler gives her temporary relief. COPD patients are always at risk of lung infection as their lung defence mechanism is weakened by smoking. So they are easily infected and once infected, infection lasts long. So same happened with your mother too.This infection causes poor oxygenation so patient has to put on life support. So in my opinion your mother is having poor outcome due to1. Age2. Smoking history3. Underlying COPD4. On life supports."},{"Patient":"I had the bypass heart surgery and i am also a smoker and recently i noticed that my feet were swelling and also i had shortening of breath and my doctor has prescribed me water pills and the swelling has gone and doctor took my xray of chest and told me that i was retaining water in my lungs,does this means that i had chest infection or due to heavy smoking or drinking once a week has caused the problem or do you think that i am having a heart failure.?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion it is due to cardiac failure only. In cardiac failure circulation of fluid (water) is disturbed so fluid tend to accumulate in certain places in following order.1. Legs2. Abdomen3. Lungs.So gravity dependent fluid accumulation is seen in cardiac failure. So your fluid in lung is the sign of failure only. Better to consult cardiologist and start diuretics and cardiac inotropes. Restrict your fluid intake to 1.2 to 1.5 liters per day. Avoid excess salt."},{"Patient":"My nephew just turned 12 and he went to a small hospital .

I read a little on eboli and it does not seem like he would be able to get that in ou small town of 400 people.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion it is not ebola. As ebola is spread by contact with infected persons. So it is spread by touch. And ebola 's main manifestation s are bleeding tendency.So ebola is unlikely. In my opinion he may have H1N1infection. H1N1 is known as swine flu.  It is common in children and menifest same as you explain. It is respiratory virus and cause acute respiratory failure.

There is scarring within the right middle lobe no suspicious pulmonary nodule or mass.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you shoild not worry about this report. As your CT report is normal.Minimal atelectesis in lung bases is a normal variant. No active treatment is required for this.And no need to worry for scarring. As scarring suggest old lesion only. You may have previous pneumonia which  healed and produce scarring.So no need to worry with this CT report."},{"Patient":"I have been diagnosed with a hiatal hernia. Was not diagnosed with GERD. However, recently, I have been experiencing stingy pains in my chest. Not really heart burn in the traditional since, but I do tend to burp some. The stinging in the chest seems to be center and across at various times. I did have a bicycle wreck a few years ago and was told I sprained my sternum. Could what I am feeling be a combination of heart burn and something inflamatory?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Hiatus hernia can be a cause for GERD. In hiatus hernia the gastroesophageal sphincter is displaced and thus it looses its function. So gastric acid comes up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms. Try to follow these steps for better control.1. Avoid spicy and hot food.2. Avoid stress and anxiety. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals.4. Take proton pump inhibitors. 5. Go for walk after meals.6. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in bed.7. Surgical options for hiatus hernia if not controlled by above things."},{"Patient":"Yesterday I was mowing my lawn. I know it can elevate blood pressure. But is 180/103 sound right? My pulse was 66. I had to take a break cause I was not feeling right. I felt very dizzy, out of breath and also felt like a set of heavy books were laying on top of my head. Everytime I would try to move it felt as if from my head all the way to my fingertips had a tingly sleepy feeling. I checked it 20 minutes later and it was 106/91 pulse 91. I am on one bp med atenolol. I was also on lisinopril but was taken off it because my bp kept going to low for the doctor. It seems like my bp can't stabalize. I want it to all stop.","Doctor":"hi and pleased to answer youIn case of médical drug treatment, the recommendations advise to start the hypertension treatment with a monotherapy, I mean a single molecule. After 4 weeks of initial treatment, an adaptation of the treatment is recommended.If it is not effective enough, the doctor will prescribe 2 antihypertensive drugs in combination, at low doses. We talk about dual therapy. Two thirds of hypertensive patients are undergoing dual therapy.Often, patients even need triple therapy or even Quadra therapy to normalize their blood pressure.Fortunately, there are fixed combinations, that is to say, tablets that already contain 2 or 3 antihypertensive drugs. This allows not to have to take too many different tablets per day, even under quadri-therapy. The first fixed combination of 3 antihypertensives is Exforge HCT®.I believe that for you two molecules is quite a lot for your hypertension. I urge you to keep lisinopril and stop the atenolol.I remind you that the medical treatment should not be stopped, if the tension stabilizes.best wishes"},{"Patient":"On vacation this summer in Santa Fe NM USA I experienced difficulty breathing for 3 days.

After coming home we thought he was recovering well but on July 2 again he felt severe shortness in breath so when took to Siddhartha Hispital, Kakinad, Dr. Vamsi Krishna said that the lung infection came again and this time its fungal (previously he was treated for bacterial pneumonia) and so my dad was directly admitted into ICU with ventilators support. The ICU patient dies on july 12 and the reason Dr.Vamsi Krishna said is Sudden Cardiac Arrest and it can happen anytime. Other health complications of my dad are diabetes and stints in chest. My question is if there is fungal infection that serious as to be admitted into ICU on July 2 why did the Dr fail to diagonise it when visited him on June 30 apart of weekly checkup? I felt the culture test for presense of fungal infection was done late and reports came very late on July 9.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion cardiac arrest can happen anytime on ventilated patient with diabetes and cardiac stents.So your father was a high risk patient and pneumonia made him more worse.Fungal pneumonia is not commonly seen. It is suspected only if typical x ray findings are there, not responding with antibiotics.

It is having action for 12 hours so only twice daily given.And inhaled corticosteroids are far far better and safe than oral steroids. You may also require anti allergic, anti histamine and anti inflammatory drugs too.So consult pulmonologist and diagnose first."},{"Patient":"My chest xray says: left plueral thickening with patchy opacities of the left upper lung zone.The left hilum is elavated with comparative volume loss of the left lung. The pulmonary vessel on the left shore a hanging down appearance. Foci of calcilification on The right upper zone. Heart size is normal.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should nit worry much about this report.It is old lesion and must be due to old lesion.You may have old TB and due to this fibrosis occured and long standing fibrosis causes pleural thickening,  fibrosis and calcification and volume loss.So you are having left lung malfunctioning. So better to take pulmonary vaccines like pneumococcal and h.influenzae for prevention of future infection.Better to start pulmonary rehabilitation and chest physiotherapy."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am a 27 year old female, 5'7\\" and 306 pounds.

What is going on?","Doctor":"Hi welcome to HCM. I understand your concern.Well there can be few causes of palpitations. I would like to know have you ever had an ECG done for your palpitations? Any past consult for these palpitations.It can be because of increased consumption of alcohol, caffeine, anxiety itself, deranged thyroid hormone levels, some underlying heart conditions not previously known causing irregular beating of the pump.Usually taking a dose of beta blockers can help provided there are no contraindications to their use e.g asthma, Diabetes etc.I hope my consult proved of some help.Wishing you good health."},{"Patient":"I have had a pain in my chest I have a small tumor non cancers in my r. lung but I still feel bad and I had a sputum test and the diagnosis wasfungal organisms morphologically consistent /candida species what could have caused this the dr has gave me Diflucan","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you should first rule out cardiac cause by doing ECG. If this is normal than you should consult pulmonologist and get done repeat evaluation of your right sided lesion.I advice CT Thorax for better evaluation of lung lesion.

Fibrosis2. Calcification3. Bronchiectasis4. Rarely complete resolution. So once the lesion is cured it gives healed scar lesion. And this appears as fibrosis on chest x ray.So it is nothing but old lesion. Get done sputum examination for presence of active infectionor not.So in my opinion you should not worry at all, it is old lesion and you are not infectious.

Holter monitoring is continuous ECG recording through out the day (24 hours of recording).You may have angina. So at the time out chest pain you may have ECG and when you reach to the hospital by that time pain subsided and ecg comes normal.

And so it goes all night every night for about six weeks now.","Doctor":"Hi welcome to HCM.Difficulty in breathing in lying down posture suggests orthopnoea with paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. This could be due to impaired oxygenation of the lung. I advise you to have a chest x ray and 2 dimensional echocardiography of the heart to rule out congestive heart failure. Ventilation perfusion studies help to localise the areas of the lung with pathology. Drugs like bronchodilators and inotropic agents will help to improve the circulation and airflow through the lung. Diuretics can eliminate any excess water through the lungs improving the breathing pattern. I advise you to restrict the intake of water and salt in your diet. Home oxygenation therapy will help to improve the nocturnal breathing pattern. Monitor your lung function through periodic PFT's-pulmonary function tests. Consult your pulmonologist for further help.Thank you."},{"Patient":"I have copd asthma 3-4-5 vertebrates are in bad shape.

COPD and asthma are different entity and not the same. Treatment is also different. COPD is irreversible condition while asthma is fully reversible. COPD needs smoking cessation, pulmonary rehabilitation with chest physiotherapy and pulmonary vaccination with inhaled bronchodilator.Asthma needs identification of allergen, avoidance of it and anti allergic drugs with inhaled bronchodilator s.So first diagnose yourself.And you can try physiotherapy for knee and back issues."},{"Patient":"I fell on a boat and landed on the edge on my mid/lower right back.

Arrhythmia2. Valvular heart disease.So better to get fone ECG and 2D Echo first.If both are normal than go for Holter monitoring.  In this 24 hour recording of your ECG is done. Any arrhythmia can be picked up by this.If this is also normal than we need to rule out anaemia and thyroid problem.

Is this something i need to go to the er for to get checked out?","Doctor":"HelloAll  these symptoms , chocking ( shortness of breath ) and burning sensation are due to irritant nature of ammonia produced by bleaching .Since two days ago you cleaned your house and still symptoms present so take some steroid inhalation 2 puffs 2-3 times and stop . This will relieve congestion caused by bleach.Burning of chest will also be  relieved by this but if you feel burning in chest then take antacid ( containing oxetacaine ) and this will provide complete relief.In my opinion this is not case of E R just annoying ."},{"Patient":"I m having a really, really, REALLY hard time breathing. Maybe it s because I m classified overweight or I have severe anxiety, but I don t believe this is the case. I ve been overweight since the end of elementary and my severe anxiety has been with me for almost two years, but these new problems have only appeared in the past year or so. Even at rest, if I don t focus all of my energy on breathing normally, I breathe like I just ran five miles. And exerting myself, even a little (like going upstairs, picking up something and moving it somewhere else), leaves me completely breathless for at least five minutes, normally longer. And it actually hurts to breathe. My lungs are always burning and my throat feels like someone s clawing at it from the inside. It just feels like I never have enough air around me to take in.","Doctor":"if you can focus your body into breathing normally and succeed , you do not have a problem with your lungs or your heart as if you did, you would never succeed without treatment. you could be having obstructive sleep apnea syndrome which is usually seen in obese individuals. the upper airway collapses on breathing in and this causing excess snoring at night and lethargy and sleepiness in the daytime. you have no energy because you haven't slept well. the treatment is losing weight and nasal CPAP. A small surgery of the upper airway is also helpful. you need to get a test called polysomnography to diagnose this. if your chest and throat are burning, you might have a gastric reflux. would suggest an endoscopy and pantoprazole/ domstal for 10 days ."},{"Patient":"Two months ago I had a EKG and was told it showed 'stone cold normal' at the ER.

What should I do?","Doctor":"hi and pleased to answer youYou must make a complete checkup by doing an Echocardiography exam, ECG, lipid blood test and troponin, with blood glucose. This checkup is explained by the signs you are describing that can be linked to a coronary heart disease.If this complete check-up is normal, gastritis is highly suspected and can appropriately give a range of signs suggesting a heart problem, but since if the heart problem exists, and since it can affect the vital prognosis, it is imperative to begin your examination with a focus on the cardiovascular system.as rare causes can existe, a pulmonary x-ray can be done if nothig is foundAn anxiolytic will be largely effective in helping you overcome your pathologyI wish you consult a cardiologist.best wishes"},{"Patient":"Hi, my husband keeps coughing a lot.

How do we understand the exact cause of this cough.","Doctor":"the various reasons for dry cough which persists more than 3 weeks and not associated with constitutional symptoms like weight loss or fever, include:Allergic rhinitis causing a post nasal drip at the back of your throat( check with an ent specialist), gastric reflux, drugs like enalapril and ramipril, and prolonged viral infections due to immune deficiency states like B12 deficiency.

When you are pregnant you will have an ultrasound. With the ultrasound, the specialist will measure the cerebral ventricles of the baby. On the off chance that the ventricles are 10 millimeters or more noteworthy in size, then you will be informed that your baby has \\"ventriculomegaly\\".The result of ventriculomegaly relies on upon a few components including the size of the ventricles, regardless of whether there are some other discoveries on the ultrasound, for example, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and the aftereffects of the amniocentesis. All in all, the result is more awful when the ventricles are bigger, the amniocentesis is unusual, or there are different issues seen on the ultrasound. The best result is regularly watched when: 1.) the baby's ventricles are just somewhat developed (measure between 10-15 millimeters in size, 2.) when there are no different issues seen on the ultrasound, and 3.) the hereditary testing results are ordinary this is called \\"mild lateral dilatation\\".best wishes"},{"Patient":"My sister is in the hospital for the 9th time, the doctors say she has black lung...they have treated her over 4 years with antibiotics, but she only gets better for a short time.

So good for facial skin too.And you can also use nasal cannula for oxygen with this N 95 mask."},{"Patient":"Hey i'm 18, 5ft 10in, weigh 12 st, i fainted at the weekend and got told it was only because i hardly ate anything and i consumed alot of alochol. but right now when my hearts beating it kinda feels as if there is like bubbles popping in my chest, i dont know if the incident had anything to do with this but can you help me on to what the feeling is?","Doctor":"it seems you are alcoholic and you are having palpitations. Reason could be simple like increased awareness of one heart beat or may be some heart problem.you being alcoholic at risk of heart disease so it's advisable to get once heart auscultation done and if needed echocardiography. Also get your hb checked. try to refrain from alcohol."},{"Patient":"my 25 year old daughter is experiencing shortness of breath numbness in her extremities, clammy hands ,dizziness,and difficulty swallowing, she had what was thought to be a very mild stroke 2-3 years ago, could this be the same or spider bite or what else?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on question on HCM.In my opinion you should consult doctor immediately. As all these symptoms can be due to re stroke. As swallowing difficult,  numbness in extremities,  breathing difficulties can be seen in stroke.So you may need MRI to confirm it.If MRI is normal than we have to rule out cardiac and pulminary causes.So get done ECG and 2 D Echo to rule out cardiac causes.Get done chest x ray and Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) to rule out lung disease.If all these are normal than anaemia and thyroid diseases need to rule out.So consult doctor and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"My son is 7 years old . Today we have taken a chest x ray in that report they have given, both lungs fields show parahilar vascular prominence and bilky hila.and faint haziness is seen in right lower zone, paravaradiac region s/o evolving area of consolidation. Impression: f/s/o evolving patch of pneumonitis in right lower zone. Please answer what it means and what is the treatment","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I want to ask you some questions. 1. Is your son symptomatic? 2. Is he having fever with chest symptoms? 3. Since how many days he is symptomatic?The x ray report is clearly suggestive of lung infection (pneumonia) in right lower part of lung.So if your sone is having chest symptoms like coughing, sputum production,  high respiratory rate with fever tsince 1-2 week than chances of bacterial pneumonia are high.Treatment needs antibiotics, cough suppressant, anti inflammatory drugs.So better to consult pediatrician now and start the treatment. Keep him hydrated."},{"Patient":"I have this pain in chest for the last couple of days. i have had gasses and acidity issue but today morning at times when i breathe i can feel this pain. I had got my ECG done on 15th OCtober and it was normal. Do i have anything to worry about? My doctor has prescribed MOZA MPS to be taken now","Doctor":"HelloYou didn't mention your age and the side , where you are having pain but ECG is normal means at present we can rule out heart disease.Your doctor prescribed mosapride with methypolysioloxasane as this act as antiflatulants and used in hyper acidity cases.In my opinion all these symptoms may be  due to these reasons , these include;1 Hyper acidity or chronic gastritis , diagnosis can be confirmed by upper G I endoscopy.Try raising the head of your bed about 4 inches with blocks . To control stomach acid avoid eating or drinking for 2 hours before you  lie down. It also might help yo avoid drinking alcohol or drinks with caffeine in them or eat chocolates or greasy or oily foods .Also take some antacid ( but if it contains oxetacaine will be better ) but if pain is severe you may need drugs like pantaprazole-D once or twice in a day on empty stomach.Over eating is the another causes of such symptoms , so avoid it .Tension or stress are the most common reason of such symptoms ,so be careful about that also.Hope this will help you."},{"Patient":"Hello sir, I am a Clinical Pharmacist, let me guide that a patient having dry cough, complaint of salty water with cough from last one month.

This has happened for many many years but only very occasionally (sometimes not for months at a time). It can happen when standing up or, sitting or when I lie down but never during or after exercise. The stitch only ever lasts a few seconds and never repeats the same day (more usually like I said not for months). Sometimes I notice that a while afterwards I pass wind but not always. I have no other symptoms. Please could you tell he what this could be?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you should not worry about it. As I don't think any serious disease behind your symptoms. But as a rule any chest discomfort on left side should be evaluted for cardiac cause.So I advice you to get done ECG first.If this is normal than no need to worry.It may be due to temporary isolated muscle spasm. So avoid too much thinking about it and be relax."},{"Patient":"What should I do? I have been to 2 ER s in two states as we were away from home when this occurred. I have extreme shortness of breath with any exertion. Also discomfort, not pain, in my chest off and on and more so with light exertion. I am also very fatigued. They have done chest x-ray, cat scan of chest as number was elevated to 1.28 that shows if you might have a blood clot but can t remember name of that test. That came back okay as well. Multiple EKG s and multiple blood work. Also an Echo Stress test which came back fine. Discharged me and I am home but having the same symptoms. Can t even do light housework without having to set and rest every 4-5 minutes. I do not know what to do. They did ask me to follow up with my doctor but this is a weekend but I guess I have to wait until then. Since I ve never had any breathing problems nor chest discomfort previously, this is a little frightening for me. Thanks for any advice.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Since your EKG and stress tests are normal than cardiac causes are unlikely. I advice you to get done pulmonary function test (PFT). This will help in diagnosis of acute bronchitis as a cause of your symptoms. Another possibility is anaemia and hypothyroidism. In both these conditions breathlessness on exersion occur. So get done Hb level and thyroid profile.If all of the above are normal than no need to worry. It may be related to stress and anxiety. So avoid stress and anxiety."},{"Patient":"hi i receantly quite a job that was making me sick had blood in my pool and recently got back my chest exray and i have obstructive pulmonary disease and am going for a castonoghfy when i was working i constantly complained about the gas fumes could this be the cause of my illnesses and how can i test for it doctors keep telling me there are no test","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Yes, you are right. Chronic inhalation of chemical fumes can lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).And if you are smoker chances of COPD are more.So gas fumes can cause COPD.The cornerstone of COPD diagnosis is PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). It will not only diagnose COPD, But also tells you about severity of the disease. And treatment of COPD is according to the severity of the disease.So better to consult pulmonologist first and discuss all these, get done PFT and start treatment."},{"Patient":"I have been diagnosed with MG for about a year now. I have been in the ICU on the vent 4 times since March of this year for shortness of breath. I am starting to think that the Doctors are missing something. My white cell count continues to go up everytime I get my blood tested but nothing gets said about it?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.There are many causes for high WBC count and shortness of breath in Myasthenia patients. The most common cause for high WBC count is infection. It is quite common to get infection in MG, as immunosuppressive drugs are given in MG.So better to get done chest x ray to rule out chest infection as a cause.Another possibility is muscular weakness due to the disease itself. So if your MG is not properly controlled than respiratory muscles can have fatigue and cause shortness of breath.So I advice you to consult neurologist and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"I have had a cough for a few weeks now but, as I live in Germany and don t have health insurance, it is not easy for me to go to the doctor.

I don t smoke and have taken antihistamines that help sometime, but not always.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you are having pneumonia (lung infection) or bronchitis. I am suspecting this because of1. Coughing2. Yellow sputum production.3. Shortness of breath.4.

I was working out this morning and noticed a subtle pain underneath my left chest area, seemingly originating under the left breastplate. Almost directly underneath my left nipple, and on the left side of the left pectoral muscle. Though it feels like the pain is coming from underneath the rib cage a bit. Now I did take a pre-workout stimulant before the workout, but I have done this in the past and have never experienced this kind of issue. Not sure if that rules it out, but wanted to put it out there. The pain is dull and has come and gone throughout the day. It wasn t debilitating, nor did it prevent me from doing anything today. To be honest I really only noticed it when I was sitting down watching TV. I don t have a shortness of breath or any of the other symptoms of heart related issues (so I believe). But I was a bit frightened by it and figured I would check on here. FYI, yesterday I did work out my chest, and the pain did not increase during the cardio portion of my workout this morning. Any help is appreciated.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. By your detailed history I think you are having musculoskeletal pain.But as a rule any left sided chest pain should be evaluated for cardiac cause first.So I advice you to get done ECG first to rule out cardiac cause.If this is normal than no need to worry. This is musculoskeletal pain only.Try to follow these.1. Avoid strenuous exercise. 2. Avoid heavy weight lifting. 3. Avoid bad posture during sleep.4. Take good painkillers and muscle relaxant. 5.

I do not have sleep apnea, but my oxygen levels drop to 86-88 while sleeping.  Oxygen at night is recommended.  When I lie down, I have trouble breathing.  I am always stuffed up, but the doctor says this has nothing to do with my oxygen levels.  If that's true, why will breathing with the aid of oxygen help?  Why don't they address my nasal blockage?","Doctor":"yes certainly nasal blockage can cause desaturation during lying down. I think you should get examined yourself from nearby ent specialist. possible causes like deviated nasal septum or enlargement of nasal tonsil can be treated surgically."},{"Patient":"I was hospitalized for pneumonia in middle August , given antibiotics, and had another chest x-ray a little over a week ago. My doctor says I still have pneumonia, and that there is nothing I can do. He says to get another x-ray in 6 weeks. Shouldn t I be taking more antibiotics ? I am 63 years old.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion if you are doing well and not having symptoms right now than no no need to worry at present and no need for any antibiotics further.The reason for this is follows.In pneumonia x ray infiltrates appears late, symptoms appear first. Once pneumonia resolves, symptoms will be disappear but x ray infiltrates will take time to resolve. So it may take 2-3 weeks for x ray to become normal.So no need to worry at present, get done x ray after 6 weeks. It will be normal."},{"Patient":"It says on the chest X-ray that there is a linear density seen in the right mid lungfield which may represent a prominent vessel or fibrosis.

I m a little bit worried now.. Can u tell me what is prominent vessel and fibrosis or is t just the same? Thank you","Doctor":"Hello Thanks for writing to HCMLinear density in right mid field of lung may be due to fibrosis or prominent blood vessel.Both conditions doesn't require any treatment.For confirmation,contrast CT scan of thorax should be done.Linear density is more in favour of fibrosis since you have history of tuberculosis.Fibrosis is a healed stage of infection and generally it doesn't require any intervention.Take CareDr.Indu Bhushan"},{"Patient":"hi..can i ask, what is hazy densities which are noted at the right lower lobe? and it says the rest of the lung fields are clear. Lateral c-p sinuses are blunted. And impression given was Pneumonia and also consider pleural fluid, bilateral.

This bad spell has been on since July.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Yes, you are right, COPD is irreversible disease but surely manageable and controllable through proper treatment. COPD treatment needs simultaneous application of below mentioned steps.1. Meter dose inhaler containing long acting beta 2 agonist and inhaled corticosteroids. So make sure that your inhaler is having these.2.Enroll yourself in  Pulmonary Rehabilitation Center where chest physiotherapy is available.

In my opinion it is GERD (Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease) only. But as rule any kind of chest pain should be evaluated for cardiac cause.So better to get done ECG first to rule out cardiac cause.If this is normal than it is GERD only. Progesterone only pill can cause this.GERD is due to laxity of the gastroesophageal sphincter. Due to this acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms.

My wife started complaining of shortness of breath some 6 months ago after mild exertion in the garden and after a short rest symptoms disappeared. Up to that time my wife had been fully active and enjoyed a good fully active life with no medical condition that required any form of medication. We both put the Shortness of breath down to our ageing process. On the 20-5-2011 my wife was admitted to hospital with Shortness of breath, high blood pressure, over 180 and atrial fibrillation. Since that first admission my wife has been admitted to hospital over ten times for similar reasons but only three occasions when AF had been present. I had noted that my wife’s oxygen levels had always been recorded in the 99% range and only once required oxygen to be given. This observation may not be relevant. Echocardiogram and Pulmonary function tests have been performed but appear to have been OK. On the 28-6-2011 a coronary angiogram was conducted and the followings findings have been recorded There is moderate stenosis in a high diagonal branch with mild stenosis in the proximal LAD with calcification. The circumflex artery has minor disease only and is dominant and the right coronary artery is very small. Left ventricular function is very good. As you know she was admitted several times with chest pains but negative trop. History My wife has a history of extreme low tolerance to any form of drug or alcohol and subsequently taking medication has had extreme consequences and discomfort for her, but, she has where possible continued to take them when I myself would have not. However throughout this 8 week period my wife’s condition has not improved and still wakes up with Shortness of breath, this condition comes when she is resting at any time. During this last 8 weeks my wife’s only exercise has been going to have a wash or toilet facilities and of course this brings on shortness of breath and tightness in the chest. If I were to dial 999 every time my wife was in extreme discomfort we would be dialing several times a day. We have a first meeting with our cardiologist this week and the apparent intention is to treat my wife’s condition with medication, I am extremely concerned that maybe I am not understanding the angiogram results correctly but I cannot see how that is going to solve my wife’s shortness of breath. Therefore I seek help and guidance in understandings possible alternative procedures that may be considered.","Doctor":"Angiography in 2011 is not having significant disease .the main problem appears is Atrial fibrillation and hypertension. so hypertension should be controlled and for atrial fibrillation your doctor will give some medicine to control heart rate, if heart rate is not controlled then patient will be having shortness of breath and other symptoms. in atrial fibrillation heart beats irregularly and at fast rate. so sometimes even if heart rate is controlled then patient may have symptoms due irregular beats.  overall not to worry much , condition can be well treated.

Advise some herbal medicine having no chances of any side effects.","Doctor":"sorry but there is no herbal medicine to cure aneurism ,aneurism means a defect in wall of artery arising out of wrong placement of stent or weak endothelial musclature around artery!you have to keep your blood pressure in normal range in order to prevent rupture of aneurism!A angogram repeat should be done to see the nature and extent of aneurism.As off now there is no herbal medicine socumented to cure aneurism.thank you!"},{"Patient":"my uncle is in the hospital and he asked that is caused by drugs it is also a man that was well known for years to have an addictive personality and the hospital now that he s also a veteran on and they still gave him a oxy cotton as a bit of pain medicine then everything just kind of progress from there right now here in the hospital and he s got so much fluid in his lungs I know that he can barely talk when he breathes you hear the fluid and they regiving him the lot in could that be a problem","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.If fluid is present around lungs than it must be aspirated and send for examination.There are many causes for pleural effusion. common ones are1. Infections like TB and bacterial pneumonia. 2. Malignancy.3. Cardiac causes4. Cirrhosis of liver etcSo better to get done pleural fluid aspiration and done its investigation like1. Pleural fluid routine micro2. Pleural fluid cytology3. Culture and sensitivity4. Pleural fluid ADA (Adenosine Deaminase Activity)So discuss these with doctor and proceed accordingly."},{"Patient":"I suffer with heamopsosis daily I have had two bronchoscopies waiting on results.. I also am on steroids for shortness of breath.. first xrays n CT scan showed chronic tenting of the left hemi diaphragm. . Can you please shed some light on my condition","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you should not worry about tenting of diaphragm. As this is developmental defect in the diaphragm. Diaphragm is muscle of respiration. So developmental defect can occur in it. Some part of the diaphragm is either fail to develop or develop poorly, giving rise to defectm and to compensate that defect, normal diaphragm make some modifications and this is seen as tenting on CT. So no need to worry for this as this can not be the cause for your haemoptysis."},{"Patient":"My mother has severe COPD. I suffer from it as well, but have been stable for many years due to following recommendations... ie: avoiding public places, public transportation, limiting grandchildren especially when sick, masking when in the store and using hand sanitizer. My mother, newly diagnosed (we have known for awhile but she would not go to doctor) we are trying to advise her about Casino visits, letting dirty snotty nosed grandchildren in the house, groups of church people in and out of home... sharing her phone with out cleaning, bathroom issue with so many in the house.... all these being triggers to her exacerbating her illness. 1) Is this true, or are we misinformed. 2) Any way we can get printed material about this and other precautions for severe stage with 24 hour oxygen?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.COPD treatment needs following things to be done simultaneously. 1. Quit smoking if habit is there.2. Inhaled bronchodilators having long acting beta 2 agonist and corticosteroids. 3. Pulmonary rehabilitation and chest physiotherapy with deep breathing exercise.4. Adult vaccination with pneumococcal and h.influenza to prevent infection.And once you vacconate her, no need to avoid things you have mentioned.COPD patients can live normal life once disease is controlled.And in end stage disease home oxygen therapy is needed."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have intermittent pains in the centre of my chest which is tender when I press it. It is worse when I take a deep breath. I am also on Zoloft and do suffer from anxiety as well as shortness of breath (from anxiety) but have never had this chest pain.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should get done ECG to rule out cardiac cause.If this is normal than get done chest x ray to rule out pulmonary cause.If both of the above are normal than it is mostly due to anxiety, stress and tension.So better to avoid stress and anxiety. Be rekax and keep calm.You may require counselling sessions from psychiatrist for better control of anxiety."},{"Patient":"HI I just want to know if I m just sick or if there s something more that I should know that s important?

Broad spectrum antibiotic like fluoroquinolones2. Anti histamines and anti inflammatory drugs.3. Drink plenty of liquids.If not improve in 5 days than consult ENT doctor."},{"Patient":"I have a PET positive nodule (mass) in my upper right lung. My doctor said it is about the size of a golf ball. I am having a biopsy this week. I had a 7 day round of levicor (?) antibiotic. I am very concerned it is cancer. Waiting for a biopsy is causing more anxiety. What are your thoughts.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM..In my opinion you should definitely go for biopsy as it is the best investigation for lung mass.Causes of PET positive lesions are1. Malignant lesion.2. Infective lesion like TB or fungal infection3. Inflammatory nodule.So to rule out this biopsy is needed.The size of your lesion is quite big so chances of malignancy are high.So get done biopsy."},{"Patient":"My Age: 35 Male Height: 168cm Weight: 85 Kg Having needles poking to my left of the heart in the chest area.

In my opinion you should get done ECG and 2D Echo to rule out cardiac cause.You are at higher risk for cardiac cause. The reasons are1. High cholesterol. More chances of coronary artery diseases.2. Family history of DM type 2 in both mother and father. So chances of diabetes in you are high. And diabetes is a great risk factor for heart disease.3. Family history of hypertension in mother. Hypertension can cause cardiac muscle damage and thus cause cardiac disease.So I advice you to get done ECG, 2D ECHO, cholesterol levels and sugar levels."},{"Patient":"Hello, for the past few weeks my chest has been feeling tight with the occasional sharp pain, mainly when I am either sitting or laying down.

But we have to rule out cardiac and pulmonary causes first.So please get done1. ECG to rule out cardiac cause.2. Chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary FunctionTest) to rule out lung causes.If both of the above are normal than no need to worry. It must be musculoskeletal pain only. So try to follow these.1.

I understand your concern for this.I routinely see many patients with the same query. I follow these protocol.1. CT thorax with contrast. As CT gives more idea about lung parenchyma.2. Bronchoscopy and BAL analysis for AFB.If both of these are normal than you can assure the job authority that you are not suffering from TB.So consult pulmonologist and discuss these things with him."},{"Patient":"i recently was on vacation and had a very light breakfast and didn't eat lunch. i had a strong cup of coffee and within 15 minutes it felt like my heart skipped or had a spasm that caused me to feel like I was going to pass out.

The heart is not enlarged. The great vessels are not unusual. The trachea is at midline. The diaphragm, sulci and bony thorax are remarkable. IMPRESSION: Apicolordotic view is suggested. Am I being suspected for tuberculosis?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In routine chest x ray PA view, apical region of both the lungs are not clearly visualized because of the overlying bony structures like clavicle and 1st and 2nd ribs.So any lesion involving apical part is not visualized properly.So apicolordotic view is needed. In this chest x ray is taken in such a way that bony structures are not interfering with apical structures and thus they visualized clearly.So apicolordotic view is useful in upper lobe lesions.Diseases which affect the upper lobes are1. Tuberculosis2. Sarcoidosis3. PneumoniaSo to evaluate these properly apicolordotic view is needed."},{"Patient":"I was lying in bed and could not stop coughing. I got drank some water, it didn t stop. I went to the bathroom and tried to brush my teeth. Then I started throwing up foam and it had some bright blood with a little dark blood in it. I am a little sick at my stomach now. Should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should get done Chest x ray to rule out pulmonary cause for your hemoptysis (coughing out blood).Chances of oral bleeding is also there since you start coughing blood after brushing. So consult dentist to rule out oral cause for bleeding.If both of these are nornal than no need to worry. Bleeding may be because of friction from excessive coughing. So take cough supressants and antihistamines."},{"Patient":"I had a squeezing pain in my chest today, it lasted for about 10 minutes but I still don t feel quite right (2hrs later?

What could be the reason for this?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you should for 6-7 hours more.As prolonged sedation require more time to recover.And she is sedated for better oxygenation. It is very difficult to achieve patient's co-ordination with ventilator if patient is conscious. So sedation is required to achieve acceptance with ventilator.So wait for few more hours.

I have gone through your query. Your problem can be due to Gastroesophageal reflux and gastritis. But other conditions like pancreatitis or cholecystitis should be ruled out. A physical examination should be carried out by a physician.

In this disease, the body’s immune system, mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. It can affect the skin, joints, kidneys, brain and other organs.

In practise, we use SLEDAI (Systemic Lupus Erythematosis Disease Activity Index), to make a right evaluation of the disease activity. There are a lot of Disease Modyfing Anti Rheumatologic Drugs which can be helpful for this condition, even in Autoimmune Connective Tissue Diseases, for example Plaquenil (Hydroxychloroquine), once or twice per day, a tablet of Colchicine (as antifibrotic, anti inflammatory agent), and other agents like Methotrexate if you have also articular manifestations.

Thank you very much!","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that pain and anxiety can increase blood pressure values. Painkillers are another factor that may lead to uncontrolled high blood pressure. From the other hand, if your blood pressure values increases only at the doctor office, it may be related to White Coat Syndrome, which is caused by the anxiety of fear at the doctor office. Anyway, a single value of blood pressure is not indicative of high blood pressure. That is why I would recommend to closely monitor your blood pressure values several times during the day (sitting position after 10minutes of total relax) and refer those values to your doctor. If your blood pressure values are persistently high (above 140/90mmHg), you should discuss with your doctor on the possible causes. Further lab tests may be needed.

Specifically a autoimmune condition in which your body starts fighting against its own.          Based on your history it looks like a type of vasculitis. Involvement of gum is common features of Wegners disease. It can also involve lungs and kidneys. So further information and investigations are needed to confirm.

He has been stressed a lot lately. He is 21 years old, 170 pounds and around 5'11\\". He is convinced it is not stress, but it seems like that is the cause. Is it?","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that it is important performing a comprehensive differential diagnosis of different causes that may lead to this clinical scenario: - anxiety (considering the stress at work and his age this seems to be the most probable diagnosis)- coronary artery disease- a musculoskeletal issue. The fact that he has pounding headache may be explained by anxiety, but a close monitoring of blood pressure is needed to exclude high blood pressure. Coming to this point, I would recommend consulting with his attending physician and performing some tests: - a resting ECG- a chest X ray study- complete blood count for anemia- thyroid hormone levels for possible dysfunction- PCR and ESR for inflammation- a cardiac stress test would help exclude coronary artery disease. If all the above tests result normal, you should consider anxiety as the main cause of his troubles. In such case, consulting with a specialist of this field would be helpful.

My Dermatologist tested for ANA (positive, 1:4), and anti-Smith Antibodies (positive, 155), along with skin biopsies. They seem to feel the above 2 blood test results together were a fairly strong indicator of Lupus, or at least an autoimmune connective tissue disease, in addition to all the other blood tests and urinanalysis I had done, which also show inflammatory factors. Is it really likely that I do have Lupus?","Doctor":"Hello,          If u want answer in short then yes.  Lupus or SLE is I would say a best example of autoimmune condition in which body acts against its own. Symptoms of lupus are very wide as it can affect almost any organ in body. But usually it is said to affect young to middle age women. Usually starts with joint pains, swelling of hands, redness or rash over face, photosensitivity.         This is the time lupus is commonly suspected. Along with routine blood work what I usually do is order and ANA, urine analysis and dsDNA which can help in diagnosis. As I'm your case you had ANA positive along with anti Smith which is probably 100% specific for SLE.         Based on this I would say your diagnosis is almost clear.

I read that doses of upwards of 200 mg are used, but when I called by OB, he said that this is the vaginal dosing traditonally used.

To get a lupus diagnosis, you must show symptoms of lupus in more than one part of your body.On the other hand, lupus is an autoimmune disease, meaning that is caused by an abnormal immune response that turns against the normal cells in your body  characterized by the presence of antibodies. This is why the American College of Rheumatology has proposed 11 criteria for lupus diagnosis. If you meet at least 4 (four) of these criteria, a diagnosis of lupus may be made:1- Rash on the nose and cheeks, called a butterfly rash2- Raised red patches on the skin, called a discoid rash3- Sensitivity to sunlight4- Mouth or nose ulcers5- Arthritis6- Heart or lung changes7- Nervous system changes8- Kidney changes9- Blood changes (anemia, leucopenia,ect)10- Antibodies to ds DNA11- ANA present in the bloodEven though,  there is not a single test to confirm or rule out lupus.In your case, since you report only a butterfly rash disappeared after using some creams the diagnosis of lupus seems to be less probable. Although,    I would suggest you to consider an lab evaluation:  a complete blood count (hemogram), antibodies to double stranded DNA and anti-Sm antibodies.

Feel wabbly when walking. Sometimes hard to breath in. Tingling in face and tongue. Head pain behind the eyes and at base of skull. Age 39, Female. I had a fever up to 102.4 about three weeks ago and it would last two days then come back off and on for two weeks then the above symptoms occurred. I also was bucked off a horse and landed on a week before the fevers. No broken bones but did cut my leg and bruise my back. I have had some symptoms for over a year....sensitive to sun, memory loss, extreme fatigue, muscle cramping and mood changes. Seemed like after that round of fevers, everything just started to increase in tensity and is slowly getting worse day by day. I have seen a neurosurgeon, neurologist and infectious disease doctor. I am active outdoors and own farm animals. I seriously suspect Lyme disease and was tested with 2 positive abnormal titters 49 and 23 but they tell me that that s unlikely even though I show all symptoms and even some of the bloodwork and spinal fluid results are also indicative. I have had an MRI of the brain that was clean except for sinusitis. They have ruled out MS, strokes, bleeding. I had an ACDF with plate on c5-c6 2 yrs ago and X-ray showed everything fine with that. I had three different CBCs over a period of 3 weeks and all three show high WBC, normal RBC, high platelets, high Globulins, High ESR, high total protein. CPK was 79 but now 133, vitamin d 25 Hydroxy is 13 so deficient. TSH, C-Reactive Protein, a/g ratio, albumin, b12 etc. are all normal ranges. GFR - 60. UA Analysis is normal or negative on everything except Blood -Trace, Mucous +1, Crenated RBCs Rare ABN. Spinal Tap results - clear, colorless, RBC 0, WBC 1, cells counted 25, lympho% 80, mononuclear cell % 20, glucose 63, protein 32, cryptococcus ag negative, cultures for bacteria and virus, no growth. Fungal culture pending but no growth as of day 5. Gram stain indicated mononuclear cells, no polys or organisms seen.

So avoid  the sun totally. Use cap or hat, sunblock and avoid unnecessary outing,in treatment, I think you have localized disease at present, you can try topical steroid cream, for ear as well as for mouth and nose,tacrolimus cream can also be helpful. Oral hydroxy chloroquine 200 mg 1 tab twice a day should work in your case, if no response than short course steroid to control the diseas, and drugs like cylophosphamide methotrexate azathioprine should be taken,to maintain the remision,these above drugs will be helpful in RA also, but do get prescribed by doctor and than take it,thank you,"},{"Patient":"I am a 43 yr. old female marathon runner who runs around 40 - 75 miles a week.

After that came about 7 more stomach surgeries for adhesions, exploratory, etc. Then, in 1999, a nurse gave me compartment syndrome, and I developed gangrene, had 15 surgeries in five days, almost died a few times, and was in the hospital.

It will stop hurting for a couple of days and then for four or five days in a row it is very swollen and painful and there seems to be no source.

FM does not cause inflammation, arthritis, skin rashes, or damage to tissues, organs and bones like lupus. Medications commonly used to treat lupus have little or no effect on the symptoms of FM. People with lupus often suffer from the symptoms of FM or may be initially diagnosed as having FM. If you have FM, it is important to know that it is not rare. FM is never life-threatening, and it is manageable.The clinical assessment may reveal objective evidence for a discrete illness, such as hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), polymyalgia rheumatica, or another inflammatory or autoimmune disorder. Such findings do not exclude comorbid fibromyalgia. Indeed, approximately 25% of patients with RA and approximately 50% of patients with SLE also have fibromyalgia, and the provision of optimum care in such cases impels recognition and treatment of both illnesses."},{"Patient":"Hi I am 31 yrs old and am struggling with Pots fibromialgia and lupas.

I can understand your concerns.The risk for transmission after exposure to fluids or tissues other than HIV-infected blood  has not been quantified but is probably considerably lower than for blood exposures.Transmission of HIV through intact skin has not been documentedSince your skin was intact,your chance of getting HIV or HCV infection is very low,especially if you have washed your hands with soap and water after examining the patient.Soap and water is enough to inactivate HIV and most other bacteria/virus.To allay your anxiety ,you may try to know sero-status (HIV,HCV) of the patient with SLE ,you have examined ,if possible meanwhile.Antibodies to HIV generally appear in the circulation 3–12 weeks following infection. Hepatitis C-the incubation period ranges from two weeks to six months.The presence of anti-HCV  (IgM)supports a diagnosis of acute hepatitis C. Occasionally, testing for HCV RNA or repeat anti-HCV testing later is necessary to establish the diagnosis.Regards Dr. T.K.

For about 20 yrs. I've known I've had a mitral valve prolapse, with just a flutter once in a while.  I'd cough and it would go away.  About 3 yrs. ago I went through breast cancer, mastectomy and a tram reconstruction, nothing in my lymph nodes, so I had no further treatment needed, thankfully.  About  1 1/2 yrs. ago my doctor at my regular check up said she heard more gushing in my chest and advised me to get an echo.  I didn't really feel anything and put it  off until I needed to have more reconstuction surgery last Dec.and my plastic surgeon said the same thing, so I had it done.  My cardiologist said it was moderate to severe stenosis of the aeortic valve, and another new cardiologist gave me a card that I have a bicuspid aeortic valve. He did another echo and confirmed the first report.  It was a little hard to see, but he thought I had this from birth, but it looked like I only had 2 cusps instead of 3 and now have some calcium buildup there was why it had gotten more prounounced.  I had to have some more breast reconstruction done in December, but had it done under local.  I still need another procedure of some fat transfer done in the next months to help fill in a small sunken area above the breast.  Anyway my last cardiologist appt. in June said to wait for 6 months and have another echo, unless I have any bad symptoms before.  When I think about it it seems I have more fluttering.  Stress seems to upset it a little.  I really feel good, no pain, maybe a little shortness of breath when I climb stairways, but besides a little pounding every now and then I wouldn't know it. BP is low. But because I know it, and it was a big shock as I feel like I'm falling apart and I do worry about it.  I sometimes maybe feel a little rushing in my head but that's pretty mild.  I'm pretty healthy or thought I always was til now.  I'm 5'8 weigh 148 # have some joint issues with my hips, knees and recently my shoulders, and I'm more comfortable on a bike than walking because of this.  Seems to be easier on my joints.  I went to Curves for 9 years and both in our area closed in the last 6 mos., so i try to do some form of exercise at home.  Thought I could wait til I could have a non invasive approach to the valve, I just find it really hard to think of having my chest split, especially now since I've had all my reconstruction and am in fair order there. My cardiolgist doesn't recommend the non invasive approach. And I hear the valves don't last that long and don't want to think of more surgeries down the road.  I take one drug arimidex for the breast cancer for another 2 years.  I'm ready to get rid of it, as I think it has precipitated some of my joint problems.  So far my dexi scans are o.k   What are my options and warnings.","Doctor":"you are having aortic stenosis. first you need to regularise your heart check up and regular echo to know the heart functions. if cardiologist recommend you the surgery then you should undergo it. Best option available is valve replacement. Metallic valve have good life and bioprosthetic ones have short life span. however after metallic valve replacement will need blood thinners post operatively. but in short if you surgery you should undergo it because without surgery prognosis is bad and survival is short"},{"Patient":"i am wife is having lupus from the past one year.

Well the first thing i will say is that is unlikely an infection if it has been going on for 6 months. It looks like an autoimmune problem, as you rightly said lupus with symptoms of fever joint pains, hair loss and the rash. Lupus can cause inflammation in the lungs also if left uncontrolled. Anaemia in lupus can be due to the breakdown of the red blood cells( hemolytic). What you need to do is to control the disease and the rest of the parameters will improve.

My issue is the fact that his Doctor has done all kinds of blood work to check for JM. He suspects JM because a lot of my son s symptoms mirror the symptoms of the Doctors own daughter, who died from JM. This all started after a tonsillectomy when he was 3 year old. He came to me and said my heat beeps funny we told his Pediatrician and he was referred to a cardiologist. We began to notice the palpitations seemed to be accompanied a fever. She examined him and done a lot of test, and said his heart was fine, but his Blood pressure is high. She also stated that according to his records his BP had been running high for a while. He began passing out and becoming very fatigue around age 4 1/2, and the Cardiologist saw him again. She ordered a stress test and my son couldn t complete the test ( he got too tired ). the Cardiologist still insisted his heart was fine but it was abnormal for a child to get tired that fast. She later gave another stress test and he couldn t go as far as the previous test. She referred him to Neurologist, and they couldn t find anything. by age 7, along with the chest pains, heart palpitations, fatigue, and syncope, he began having extreme pain in his neck, arms, hands, back and legs, that were accompanied with migraines. By age 7 1/2 his joints began to swell, and looked red, and were hot to touch (at times). By age 8, he started having problems with chewing and swallowing food, because of pain ( this is also about the time the red rash began to appear on his cheeks). His frequent fevers have been present since we first noticed them, but his blood work is often, but not always, fine ( no abnormal WBC) We can t remember when we noticed, but his hands are always in a fist position, and he can t coordinate his fingers to tie his shoes. Attached is a picture of the rash on his face. Notice how it spreads from his jaw, across his cheeks, and up the bridge of his nose. it also has small bumps. It looks like my lupus butterfly I get.

Dilated ascending aorta aint such a good sign especially with the size expanding from 3.6 to 4.6 cms. I hope you are under the Follow up of a cardio thoracic surgeon. As for yourself, you need to avoid any stress( emotional and physical) and avoid any heavy exertion exercises. These activities increase the blood flow through the aorta and can cause rupture.

The kind of pain you are describing is classically seen with pancreatitis. It is condition which causes inflammation of the pancreas organ. It can affect her appetite and it can cause severe pain in the tummy which radiates to the back. Pancreatitis can be seen in lupus due to the disease itself or if she is on medications like Azathioprine or high dose steroids. Do consult your doctor at the earliest.

The treatment for DLE is a bit tough as not many medications work for it. PLaquenil is the drug of choice but since you are unable to take  it, low dose of steroids should help. If you only have butterfly rash and no rashes elsewhere, you can take a course of oral steroids along with topical creams like tacrolismus( after presciption from your rheumatologist). I wont recommend topical steroids for the face as it can cause skin atrophy on that site. Also the dose of MTX is quite low. It starts being effective from 15 mg. It can help in the skin problems due to SLE. Avoid going in the sun and if you have to use a good sunscreen with Protective FActor of at least 50. Only having rash is not too serious, so you dont need very strong medications for it.

I would like to know more details on she not keeping well. Is it fever.mouth ulcers..bodyache..joint pains? The blood tests do show a low platelet count and high ESR. The rashes are a bit non specific but can be seen in any autoimmune condition. At this stage it is very hard to say if it is exactly lupus or something else. You need to get her ANA tested along with ENA profile. We must figure out a cause for this blood picture. These two tests will help us reach the diagnosis.

Am I more vulnerable to heat because of the meds, and/or because of the conditions?","Doctor":"Good evening mam. The lupus medications can give generate more of heat especially prednisolone. It increases the body alertness Nd metabolic rate. One feels very active. But it is a very non specific symptom.

Are there any other tests my doctor can give me to check if it is lupus, lyme disease (I was bitten by something that had hooks into me a few years ago) or a specific type of consultant to go to to check other than my rheumatologist. Have also had a few falls due to the weakness too. Bladder function seems more frequent but passing less.","Doctor":"Good evening sir. The temporary loss of vision and paralysis along with polymyalgia Rheumatica is highly suggestive of Giant Cell arteritis( GCA). If you havnt been evaluated for that, you should ask your rheumatologist for the same. GCA has a strong association with polymyalgia rheumatica. Your doctor needs to check for your temporal artery , MRI brain and carotid doppler if it hasnt been done. The possibility of Lyme Disease is less likely as it does not present with such symptoms. If you have suspicion for Lupus, do get your ANA done although it looks less likely. Hope the information was useful"},{"Patient":"I have lupus and kidney problems.

ANA, DsDNA, Complement C3 and C4 are highly specific for lupus. and if they are present along with the symptoms you describe, it is confirmatory. 90 mg is a very high dose of steroid to start with and if the rashes, joint pains are appearing after tapering it, there is a chance that Lupus was just hidden due to steroids.

I appreciate your query of health concern. Heart disease is not only a cause of legs swelling. There are so many causes.    After venous insufficiency, obesity is the next most common cause of lower extremity swelling. Abdominal obesity partially obstructs venous outflow and lymphatic outflow from the legs. Obesity also accelerates the stretching of the leg veins due to the effects of gravity, thus contributing to the progression of venous insufficiency.

Now I am 27 years old. I got this at the age of 19. I have stopped consuming drugs from past 5 years. Now my parents are forcing to marry me. Can a SLE patient get marry. Will this disease transfer to my childrens..","Doctor":"Hello Gani .As you know that SLE is a systemic disease that involves various organs.And that is a really good thing that your disese is under control now.SLE patients can obviously live absolutely normal life as other normal persons, hence you can go ahead with marriage.After that ,you can plan for pregnancy also as fertility rates of a SLE patient is same as a normal person.so don't worry about it.But i would like to advice you certain things to be taken care of before getting pregnant, are as following :1. Make sure that your disease is not active at least for 6 months.For that you can go for routine blood tests including cell counts ,Liver and renal function tests ,Urine examination ,C3 complement and Anti ds DNA antibody levels.2. ANA profile, Anti cardiolipin antibody and lupus anticoagulant tests are the tests which can guide us in screening and monitoring of pregnancy.3. There are chances that lupus features may reappear during pregnancy so keep regular follow up with your Rheumatologist.Lastly,yes there are slightly more chances of all autoimmune disease(like SLE) to run in families as compared to other person without any family history getting SLE.I hope this answer will help you.Thank you .Regards."},{"Patient":"I am a 51-year old female.

Patients with PVCs have to be evaluated for a possible strucutral heart disease which will neccesitate urgent management.

This area is like a strip over one side of skin, where that particular group of nerves travel. but again if, different parts of body is involved, than chances of shingles is very less.

She is a starter for her team, something she has had to worked hard for this past year.She could not play last year because of a left leg shin fracture. I think it was because she was on prednisone and it weakened her bones. It took her a long time to heal last year. Now she is playing a lot and has started to develop a shin fracture on her right leg. Very painful! She has again started to flare. She had a hard time getting out of bed one day this week. I took her to the doctor and they are starting her on a higher dose of prednisone plus methotrexate and folic acid. She was on cellcept for about 3 year. She also did 4 treatment (one series) of retuxinab (?). I want her to be done with volleyball but she is a determined young lady who loves to play.

The fact that you have SLE makes me think that you must be on glucocorticoids, and some other immunosuppressant drugs to control your disease, which would make you susceptible to infections and also diabetes. So I would advise the following in my patient:1) If your SLE is under control, your physician/rheumatologist may reduce the drug doses as per need to control the infection. 2) look for diabetes by checking you fasting blood glucose and post prandial blood glucose levels; if high this needs to be controlled3) control the present infection with an adequate course of antibiotics like amoxicillin/clavulinic acid (augmentin for example), draining of the pus collection if required, and dressing.4) if you have nasal carriage of staphylococcus aureus, this makes you predisposed to recurrent boils, and this needs to be eradicated. With these measures, the infection can be controlled.Thank you."},{"Patient":"Hi thanks asking me to ask questions - Can you get Lupus from taking HIV drugs?What kind of drugs are used for HIV patients?

Treatment is usually symptomatic, but when well followed by the patient there are very long symptom free periods and improved quality of life.

I take Plaquenil and took the Prednisone along with it before but since I am allergic to the Prednisone all I am taking is the Plaquenil is there any other drugs that I can take to prevent organ problems.  I should say that my Liver and now my Stomach are both affected by this disease.","Doctor":"Hi. Lupus is a disease known for flares and exacerbations. There are a number of drugs available to prevent the flares of disease and to treat exacerbations. Plaquenil/ Hydroxychloroquine is one drug which you may need to take life long since there is evidence that it prevents many a complication due to this disease. Prednisone is also a drug which is usually prescribed for long periods tapering it to as little a dose as required. Allergy to prednisone is not very common though not impossible. There are a number of other alternatives to prednisone in the glucocorticoid class of drugs which can be substituted for. Other drugs called steroid sparing agents are added to reduce the dose of glucocorticoids to the minimun including azathioprine, mycophenolate, methotrexate and cyclophosphamide to mention a few. This disease requires regular monitoring and evaluation by a Rheumatologist to optimise treatment with minimal side effects and to pick up flares of disease at the earliest so that they can be controlled.

The drugs could range from non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, to analgesics, cortisteroids and tricyclic anti depressants, depending on whether there are neurologic manifestations or not.It is also necessary for you to get a complete clinical review to exclude any possible cause for immune depression.

Coming to the history 3 months back i lost my baby in my 36th week of pregnency and when doctors diagnosed they found i have lupus anti coagulant +ve (but it is lower level) and that is the reason for intrauterine fetal death. I also have severe back pain through out my pregnency before and after one week back when i did test with regards as suggested by orthopedic doctor the results are like this 1) CRP (C Reactive Protein) is +ve  2) ESR is also crossed levels 3) Uric Acid is on boader level and 4) vit D is deficient(5).   I want to plan for my next baby now because if I age more problems also will increase and when i went to gynic doctor she suggested me to take folic acid and ' aspirin tab to prevent blood clotting'. Then i said can i use nutrilite iron folic instead of folic acid then she said the herbal things some times will interact with some health conditions so she asked me to stop all herbal things. in my previous pregnency I had lupus only towards the end not from start and I have been taking \\" daily multivitamin,cal mag d,iron folic, concentrated fruits and vegtabes,salmon omega 3 and protein powder\\".i read in multiple articles that Alfa Alfa herbal concentrate creates lupus condition some times and even on amway web site they have mentioned 'for cal mag d they mentioned people with lupus need to check with doctor'.Other than this I never had in my life any other health problem and my stress levels are also not too high. Now my doubt is is my health concern or lupus got triggered because of too much of Alfa Alfa concentrate from herbal thing? What do I need to use to become healthier again? Do I need to continue Nutrilite stuff?

First, you have already been on treatment, and steroid therapy, for that reason. This alters somehow the normal inflammatory response and distorts to an extent the expected physiological hormonal changes. Expertise of an endocrinololgist in the interpretation of these results is advised.It is possible you could have a mixed connective tissue disease. Symptoms here span from those fron Sjogren's, syndrome, Lupus, mixed connective tissue disease. Your rheumatologist will certainly ask of an ascernal of biological tests (ANA, p ANCA, cANCA, CrP, ESR, CBC, Rheumatoid factor, Anti Ds DNA, anti Sm antibodies). X rays to evaluate any degenerative of demineralization lesions at the level of the joints could also be seen. I strongly suggest you consult your rheumatologist and an endocrinologist.

Now they are growing very rapidly. I am sure these lipomas occurred through genetic disorder as my mother and father both of them have it in limited numbers. I am having almost 70 Lipomas over my whole body and few of them are extremely large (6 X 6 inches).I started homeopathic treatment recently (since last 1 month) but Lipomas are still increasing rapidly (2-3 Lipomas per week). I also visited a laser surgeon recently but he asked me to remove the lipomas through surgery and also told that there is no cure for this disease. While according to my knowledge lipoma is a disorder and not a disease ,hence I did not visit him again. I thought I need to burn excess fats in my body which may be the reason of the growth of lipomas so I have started swimming and running. But I am not really sure if it is helpful in order to control the growth of Lipoma. I take a lot of tea/coffee and also like to have junk food thought recently I have gained some control on my food habits. I don?t drink/smoke and don?t have any other ill habit of similar nature. I work at a place where I need to sit at my desk in front of a computer for 9-10 hours and I am not sure if this contributes to my weak digestion and results in formation of fatty acids which may form lipomas. My concern now is specifically, some large lipomas on my right hand which sometimes obstruct movement and I wish to get rid of them before they cause any big problem. And also wish to control growth of lipomas over other parts of my body. Please suggest if there are any ayurvedic treatments which can cure/reduce/control the growth of Lipoma. Also help me to understand what should be my diet, and whether swimming and running will help me to reduce the growth of Lipoma.","Doctor":"Hello user,I don't think any Ayurvedic or any other medicine system will take care of your lipoma swelling.

If you were to split my head into quarters, the pain was on my left front side across forehead and behind eye. Neuro dx migraines. Aprox 1 month later L eye lid droopy and was unable to open. I went to a Nerooptic: treated with medrol dose pack. surgery for inflammation of the lacrimal gland. Since then my eye twitches and mild ptosis. I also have these \\"migraines\\" several times per wk. I began to feel fatigue often with SOB. I just associated this with me not getting enough sleep, not eating healthy, just normal things that come as you get older. However, I am only 29. I started to have to take breaks/rest between chores/tasks.  I am 5'6 and weigh 146lbs I get light headed/double vision/see spots if I stand too long ex: in line at a store, or if I am in extreme heat outdoors or hot shower/bath. Palms sweaty/clamy often. If I push myself too far or stand in place for a length of time I get burning sensation and red cheeks. I get light headed, blurred vision and often arms get weak and \\"heavy\\" w/ overhead activities , ex. Hanging clothes, putting dishes away, etc.  In the last six months I feel as if my muscle weakness and fatigue has gotten progressively worse. I was having to take breaks just to blow dry my hair. I went to my PCP with these complaints, as I felt something was not right. She ran a CBC and basic metabolic panel which came back normal. She said I was not getting enough sleep and always on the go. I also have a good bit of physical and emotional demands as I have an Autistic child. I tried to slow down and get more sleep. However, I just kept getting weaker needing more breaks. I feel the best first thing in am, sometimes just sitting with eyes closed for 10-15min \\"recharge\\" for a short period of time. Three wks ago severe ptosis in L eye. The orig neuro optic was out of town. Therefore I had to see someone else.  He did not think ptosis caused by inflammation of lacrimal gland. He started me on augmentin as a precaution in case of infection. Two days later when the ptosis did not improve started 80mg of prednisone. Within three days I was so weak that I could barley walk. I could not get up from a laying position, stand from a seated position etc without the use of my arms. At times I was so weak that I could not even lift a gallon of milk. I started having problems talking, my speech sounded very low and slurred. The neuro optic did a CT scan of sinus and orbits and blood work.  CT was negative. The basic MG antibody test came back neg but positive ANA. One wk from starting the prednisone i was so weak i could not stand well unassisted, I was having bad dysarthria to where my speech was very slurred and hard to understand.  The neuro optic stated he still felt I had MG and was going into crisis. He sent me to the ER. The Neuro at the hospital said that it was not MG as if it is impossible to have MG without testing positive. (he did not do a MuSK Antibody test or a CT of my thymus) He immediately said he felt as it was somatization disorder. He was able to see both my son and my medical records as we use the same hospital for all specialist. I had also been taking Wellbutrin and adavan for anxiety. He consulted rheumatology for the positive ANA. They suspected Lupus or another autoimmune disorder and ran a bunch a blood panels. I had two MRIs of my head, one MRI of my leg (looking for muscle inflam) a xray of my chest, and a pulmonary function test. The MRIs were all neg except for leg Which noted slight increased hyperintense signal on axial stir sequences along the medial compartment although this may be secondary to artifact. It also noted cystic lesions within both axenia. (I do have endometriosis w/ removal of right ovary/tube in 2005). The pulmonary function test showed mild pulmonary restriction suggested by the decrease in residual volume. Max inspriatory pressure is normal. Max expiratory pressure is decreased. The blood levels that were abnormal are as follows+ANA+adolaseBUN 23Alkaline Phosphate 54Carbon Dioxide 22WBC 23.56Myelos 2Segs 92%lymphs 5%aldolase 26.5Trace of leukocytes in urineThese antibody were negAntiDS/DNA Anti NuclearAchR HIV/Hepatitis/Drug NegEMG showed carpal tunnel and chronic cervical C5/6 radiculopathyRNS on bilateral nerves no consistant decremental or incremental responses.

I do not like that neuro at hospital just dismised me and was so quick to say it was stress/somatization. What could these test/symptoms be caused from? Could this all just be stress related?

Dear madam , Looking into your problem i would say that throbbing and prominent veins can be a sign of thrombophlebitis or impending thrombosis.  SLE patients are prone for thrombotic complications so it could be a sign for that .

Thank","Doctor":"Hi and thanks for the query,a greater characterization and understanding of the issue of burning is necessary to be understood. Conditions like inflammations with poorly controlled lupus, viral infections, electrolyte abnormalities and peripheral nerve disease could cause the burning sensation A clinical evaluation is mandatory to orient further testing. Consulting an orthopedic surgeon of a reference hospital could guide you on how to obtain what you want. However, a proper clinical reevaluation by a rheumtologist to confirm and elucidate evolution of lupus is important. Poorly controlled lupus could also contribute to such symptoms.I suggest you consult your orthopedic surgeon and rheumatologist for evaluation and advice.

However, compliance to treatment protocols and a step wise medication approach usually leads to complete stabilisation and amelioration of clinical condition. Appropriate medication controls symptoms and stops continues excessive hairless.Drugs range from Non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, steroids, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate,  to gold salts and others depending on the case.

Dear Jennet, Well since you have been suffering from lupus , you must be knowing that kidneys are one of the primary organs that are affected by lupus wht we call as lupus nephritis .You also have a strong family history of autoimmune disease. Regarding sjogrens syndrome , yes people suffering from lupus can develop this disease secondarily . If you have symptoms such as excessive dryness of eyes , frequent blinking , grittiness in eyes , dryness of mouth , swelling over jaw bones due to enlarged parotids ,you may be having this disorder.

Dear madam, Whatever information you have provided is insufficient to guide you. low blood sugar is not related to autoimmune disease . generally in autoimmune disorders the is hemolysis leading to anaemia but thats not universal .

How and where to take care of a patient suffering from SLE !","Doctor":"Hi, Systemic lupus erythematosus, referred to as SLE or lupus, is sometimes called the \\"great imitator.\\" Why? Because of its wide range of symptoms, people often confuse lupus with other health problems. Lupus affects mainly the joints, kidneys and skin. It can range from mild to serious.

I am taking Azoran 50, Mexate(4 tab weekly), wysolone 5 mg along with calcium tablets and other medicines for heart disease. Pls. tell me the side effects of these medicines and also let me know that whether it will effect to my heart disease?","Doctor":"Hi! Thanks for your query. Dear sir, Methotrexate and steroids form the sheet anchor of treatment for SLE. Azathioprine is a steroid sparing agent . Since you have been started on these three medications , that means that disease activity is high . These medicines have their own side effects on almost every organ of body but considering  the disease you suffer from it is definitely important to continue these medications . SLE itself can lead to heart problems like pericardial effusion . You should get your  routine blood tests Like CBC, liver function tests , renal function tests while on these medications and be in constant touch with your rheumatologist for regular assessment .I also advise you to get your calcium levels checked as recent studies claim that excessive calcium deposition can lead to atherosclerosis.

Well you didnt mention your age when you had stroke because young age stroke can be a manifestation of connective tissue disorders  You didnt give an account of which antibodies you are positive and on which grounds your diagnosis was made of sjogrens syndrome . Sudden fall in Hb can be due to autoimmune hemolytic anaemia but you didnt mention whether after starting steroids it showed an improvement and by how much .If you suffer from sjogrens syndrome as you have mentioned then disease activity should be evaluated at earliest by ESR , CRP, Schirmers test and other relevant investigation as desired by your treating doctor.

Well when one is allergic to some drug like you had with plaqenil ( hydroxychloroquine). , one may suffer from severe allergic reactions even anaphylactic shock also on consuming the drug . But these reactions recur only when you take the same drug again . so, since you know that you are allergic you should tell your doctor that he should not prescribe this medicine .

Both lupus and vitiligo are diseae that belong to autoimmune category although many other etiologies are suggested for vitiligo it is possible to see them both in combination. For vitiligo control many options are available but since you suffer from lupus i would suggest you consult a dermatologist and rheumatologist both before starting any therapy because PUVA therapy is not recommended in patients with lupus as it uses UV rays which are a known causative factor for lupus and thus exacerbate the existing disease leading to flare. Plus you must be taking some drugs for lupus they need to be assessed , organ involvement and disease activity must be determine before taking any decision .

I have also had itchy white patches when i stand for over 5 minutes what do u think about all of this","Doctor":"it is unlikely to be auto immune in nature. autoimmune problems generally are serious disorders starting with fever, weight loss, arthritis. they may involve rashes but rashes are generally photo sensitive, the cold hands and feet may be a feature of autoimmune disorders but they are generally associated with raynauds phenomenon which is a bluish discoloration of hands and feet in response to cold. and last of all it needs to be backed by blood work up which should suggest an autoimmune disorder."},{"Patient":"My daughters gums are very red and tender, dentist could not find anything.

SLE is a disease that can affect persons of all ages and ethnic groups and both sexes, but more than 90% of new patients presenting with SLE are women in the childbearing years. Inflammation caused by SLE can affect various organs including joints. Hip joint is one of he most common joint to get affected. Joint pain or arthritis is experienced by 95% of people with lupus at some time during the course of their disease. In fact, joint pain is usually the first symptom of lupus.  When a particular joint is affected on one side of the body, the same joint on the other side of the body is usually affected as well. You seem to have developed bone tissue death of hip joint called as avascular necrosis. Although before suggesting hip replacement surgery,doctors try medications along with physical therapy. But ,it seems that these options have been exhausted and destruction of hip joints is far advanced.It seems hip replacement surgery would be ideal for you and that is the reason you have been advised this surgery however,you should take opinion from some other orthopedic surgeon regarding this.  In the past, hip replacement surgery was an option primarily for people over 60 years of age. In recent years, however, doctors have found that hip replacement surgery can be very successful in younger people as well.

At time I get pains in my elbow joints like tennis elbow also which a doc said was tennis elbow.

The ANA ELISA test gives you a number for an answer and the normal range is given in brackets next to it. All these test results show that specific autoantibodies are absent in your blood and therefore the chances of an autoimmune or connective tissue disease (like SLE) are very low. Obviously this test (if positive) is just one of 11 criteria for SLE, so you need to ask your doctor why he did the test. The low positive rheumatoid factor is non-specific and the more specific test for rheumatoid arthritis is the anti-CCP antibody test.

With your background history, and fever with swollen joints and paresthesia, you need to get in touch with your Rheumatologist as soon as possible. Joint aspiration for pus c/s and examination for crystals, plus increase in pain relief medications and/or immunosuppression will then need to be decided as per the results.

Recently I was diagnosed with sjorgren s disease and the Dr. also told me that there were some other markers in my blood for lupus or other connective tissue disease . It will take several months before I get to see a rhuemetologist. My mother and two of my cousins on my mother s side had Ms. I have been having symptoms for over 12 years now such as extreme fatigue which comes on suddenly with weakness in my legs, dizziness , during both my pregnancies I had paraxsysmal tachacardia which stopped as soon as I was no longer pregnant, pericaritis, blue toes and a few times nail beds, itchy rashy scalp , at times I ve thought I was going to pass out and then afterwards I felt like I was on drugs or something, like I was kind of out of it or high? My question is, is it possible that Sjorgren s can cause all these things or is it really pointing more towards lupus, and also what can I do in the mean time while I m waiting to be refered to a reumalologist? Is tumeric safe as an anti inflammatory?","Doctor":"Hello, Sjogrens syndrome usually causes dryness of mucosa (eyes, mouth etc) and arthralgia, recurrent parotid (salivary) gland infections or swelling is common. There are other overlap syndrome such as with Rheumatoid arthritis, myositis, Raynaud's known as Mixed Connectibve Tissue Disease (MCTD) where symptoms can be variable and Undifferentiated CTD (UCTD) does not fit in any one disease pattern as the name suggests. Blood tests (ENA panel or complete profile) can help with the diagnosis.

There are several others such as discoid rash, malar rash (butterfly rash), serositis, arthritis, blood abnormalities, CNS abnormalities, ANA positive, ACL abs etc so a thorough clinical & lab reports are required before such a diagnosis is done.

My mother has lupus should i be concerned that i do too?","Doctor":"Hi there. At the outset, you will need to be more specific. Nobody has surgery for 'nerve damage' unless there is some trauma preceding or there is some underlying 'neurological cause' for the damage. What nerve was involved & was it an isolated occurence? Were there any skin patches with loss of sensation or any paraesthesia or motor or sensory loss? What was the surgery done?I can only presume he put you on medrol to decrease the inflammation. If am not mistaken, medrol is a corticosteroid & comes in oral tabs & injectables.It need not mean you have an autoimmune disease. There are certain blood tests that can be done to confirm or allay your fears. Just because your mother has Lupus, does not mean you will have it too. I suggest you can go back to your doctor & ASK him why he put you on medrol & also request him to do the necessary basic tests in the 'lupus package' to Rule out any lupus & put your mind at rest.

We are off to mayo in mid July but she can go out in the sun from 10-4 she can t handle heat and has been diagnosed with pseudopheochromocytoma ? What can I do to help her she is only 5!","Doctor":"Hello Dimokry At the outset I can assure that you are not alone. There are several dedicated doctors who would like to help you. When we do not know what is exactly wrong with our child we need to think from 7 angles 1. What is the problem? 2. Why it would have come? Hereditary/ infection / allergy 3. What are the tests required? Painful and painless tests. Scans. We have done several investigations. Do they need to be repeated again and again 4. What are the drugs child require? Should they have to taken daily like diabetic drugs or as and when required, like acetaminophen? 5. What are special diet the child will require? 6. Apart from drugs and diet what are precaution one has to take at home? 7. Lastly, how will be her future? Should we do anything to-day to safeguard her future. Now let us one at a time. ANA positive does not mean anything serious. It just suggests your child MAY require further investigations. If you have done them, be reassured. Regarding ? pseudopheochromocytoma: you have not mentioned about Documented hypertension Documented tachycardia ( fast hear rate ) Abdomen scan ruling out adrenal tumours Importantly response to adrenergic blocking drugs This would be helpful. ?pseudopheochromocytoma is not diagnosed just like that. please add more details. Regarding blood in the stools can occur in several conditions. Anus redness is can happen in several conditions ranging from milk allergy to dust allergy (atopic disorders). Was there any frank bleeding from rectum? Has she had any rashes in her skin. there is another way to proceed. Check her weight ( atleast 16 to 18 kg) Height ( 99 to 105 cms) Head ( more than 47cm ) Chest ( more than the head ) Mid arm circumference ( 15 cms) If her growth is in this range means there could be nothing serious. Regarding exhaustion, what was her hemoglobin level. That could explain. Give her small frequent fluid diet. Be with her. Parents warmth can do wonders. Regularly post the progress. Before going to mayo, try to document her course in the last 8 weeks. Problems, duration, drugs given, response to drugs Regarding the tests you have done classify them as 1. Basic tests 2. Biochemical tests 3. Imaging studies.

Your physician is acting on a suspicion and needs to gather evidence.  SLE can affect many parts of the body.  The criteria for determining if your daughter has SLE involves several observations. 1.  Malar rashes, a butterfly-patterned rash over the nasal bridge of her nose and onto the cheeks. 2.  Discoid rash, a raised rash in a roughly circular pattern. 3.  Photosensitivity, a rash in reaction to ultra-violet light. 4.  Oral and nasopharyngeal ulcers that must be observed by a physician. 5.  Arthritis, in 2 or more joints characterized by swelling, tenderness, or effusion. 6.  Serositis, pleuritis or pericarditis which is inflammation of the lungs or heart. 7.  Renal disorder, characterized by proteinurea or castings. 8.  Neurological symptoms, seizures or psychosis without other causes. 9.  Blood disorders characterized by anemia and other signs. 10.  Immunological disorders defined by blood testing. 11.  Antinuclear antibodies that are detected by blood testing. Any combination of 4 or more of the above criteria makes it more likely that the patient has SLE.  If you are concerned with the care your OB/GYN physician is giving your daughter, a second opinion is your right.  I recommend a physician who deals in rheumatologic diseases and sees a great deal of SLE in their practice."},{"Patient":"what does it means when you have bumps on your body What does it mean to have a bump on my forearm the size of a quarter?

Finally, in addition to negative SS-A and positive SS-B, my ENA panel shows below average slightly for ANTI-DNA, RNP Abs, and Smith ABs. With not seeing a Rheumatologist, my primary care physicians says I have a 10% chance of having SLE and a 30% chance of Sjogren s Syndrome. I have multiple symptoms of both conditions, however, no dry mouth . My symptoms include a long list, but it appears I have the following symptoms: Sinus Issues Reynauds Some joint discomfort in ankles, fingers, and knees My tonsils are slightly disfigured with particles that show up in them A history of weak and cavity ridden teeth Memory loss and confusion Dizziness Infrequent migraines w/ aura Frequent urination Fitigue Anxiety and Depression (Random) Rough/course and dry hair Acne Blurred Vision Trouble sleeping due to back pain Green mucus etc. No rashes or dry mouth Any help would be greatly appreciated in calming my anxiety over the blood test results.

Since the inability to sleep is still present even after discontinuing the medicine, I think we should look for some other causes also.

Diuretics (or water pills) and beta blockers are two classes of blood pressure lowering medication that are known to cause problems with sexual performance. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker and this group of medications rarely causes erection problems.Rather than a medication side effect of amlodipine, erectile dysfunction might actually be a sign of inadequate control of blood pressure. High blood pressure damages blood vessels, reducing the blood flow to the penis and thus making it more difficult to achieve and sustain an erection.

There was no adverse report. Since them he is taking the following medicines as prescribed by the Dr.there. (a) Envas 5 mg (Now 10 mg) and (b) Amlong (5 Mg). His average BP at present comes 185/85. My question is whether he may forgive or reduce his medicines or whole life he has to depend on medicines. Is there any side effect of the BP medicines on health. Pl. explain.","Doctor":"Hi,Brief answer: Very elevated blood pressures will generally require long term management with blood pressure medications. The risks of stroke heart attack, and kidney failure from untreated high blood pressure greatly outweighs the risks from taking the blood pressure medication.Detailed answer: Blood pressure measures the force at which blood pushes on the wall of the blood vessels. High blood pressure (hypertension) is a very common common condition. High blood pressure puts stress on the heart and can cause the heart to fail and cause heart attacks. High blood pressure in the brain can lead to a stroke or cause bleeding in the brain. High blood pressure can also damage the kidney. To reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, or kidney failure, high blood pressure needs to be treated. Treatment of high blood pressure includes lifestyle changes like eating a well-balanced heart healthy diet, exercising regularly, stress reduction, losing weight if overweight, drinking alcohol in moderation, and not smoking as well as pharmacologic therapy with blood pressure medications.Very high blood pressure (or Stage 2 hypertension), like your son's, can require two or more (sometimes up to four) blood pressure medications to get under control. There are single pills that actually contain a combination of blood pressure medications, so that would make taking medication a bit easier for your son. All medications have side effects and risks. Blood pressure medications can cause the blood pressure to become to low and cause lightheadedness, dizziness, and nausea. Some medications can cause imbalance of electrolytes like sodium and potassium. However, these risk from taking medications are far outweighed by both the benefit of treating high blood pressure on overall health in the long-term as well as by the risk of not treating high blood pressure. Appropriately treating high blood pressure has been shown to greatly reduce risk of heart failure, heart attack, stroke, and death.I would encourage you and your son talk to his doctor about his blood pressure medications and options to reduce the number of pills that he is prescribed.Hope I have answered your question.

Recently I abruptly stopped taking lexapro and diazepam ( I was already off the other medications). How does this affect me? I can t sleep well. and what will happen if one pops 3 combiflams on an empty stomach everyday? and what happens if one combines some ecstacy with diazepam and effexor XR? and does stopping medication abruptly lead to a grown propensity towards drugs? and will the combiflams kill me?","Doctor":"Hi,Brief answer: Always take medication as prescribed and abstain from using illicit drugs.Detailed answer: Antidepressant medications, including Lexapro and Effexor act on various chemicals and signals in the brain. These medications help to increase the amount of the chemical serotonin in the brain. Abruptly stopping these medications can cause serious side effects, in particular antidepressant discontinuation syndrome. Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome presents with difficulty sleeping, flu-like symptoms (fatigue, muscle aches, headache, feeling ill), electric shock-like sensations, and anxiety. Patients must be slowly weaned off these medications.Use of illicit drugs like Ecstacy is problematic, especially considering that you are already taking medications that influence your brain and central nervous system. Ecstacy has stimulant effects and acts by increasing the same chemicals in the brain as Lexapro and Effexor. If your serotonin levels increase too much it can cause Serotonin Syndrome, a very serious an potentially fatal complication involving very high blood pressure, fever, muscle rigidity, and seizures.I always advise patients to take their medications as prescribed. It is never advisable to abruptly discontinue a medication without speaking to a doctor before doing so.

I have done a derma surgery on my face in February 2010 and since than i ve been taking the medicine on and off without consulting my physician. is it safe for me to continue the medicine? Is there any side effect if i continue taking for a longer period of time?","Doctor":"Hi,Brief answer: In my opinion, if taken as directed, there is likely little harm in taking the Antoxid hc multivitamin and mineral supplement. However, the best sources of these same vitamins and minerals is from a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables.Detailed answer: Antoxid hc contains many vitamins and minerals that serve as antioxidants to help boost the body immune system, fight inflammation, and prevent damage to organs from oxidizing free radicals. In particular the Antoxid hc contains beta-carotene, a form of vitamin A, which helps with promoting good skin health and vision functions. Note though that supplementation with beta-carotene has not been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease or cancer.  Beta-carotene supplementation has been shown to be linked to lung cancer, but the evidence is conflicting, and the increased risk in lung cancer is more so for smokers and individuals exposed to asbestos. Also, too much beta-carotene from supplements can cause yellowing of the skin. I recommend patients to consume dietary sources of beta-carotene because beta-carotene from natural food sources do not harm the body. Foods rich in beta-carotene include carrots (boiled), sweet potatoes, dark leafy greens (eg, kale, spinach, mustard greens), and butternut squash. Please consult with your doctor about all medications you are taking, including supplements.

Mostly, it is due to sluggish thyroid. Making sure there is enough iodine in the diet is essential and often changes thyroid activity to a small but significant degree. Don't use silly high amounts but make certain there is at least 100% of the RDA. Also, the RDA is quite an oversimplification in this particular case because the amount of thyroid hormone varies with stress. Serious illness causes a temporary decrease in thyroid hormone and results in over prescribing of hypothyroid treatment very very commonly. And, changes in thyroid hormone on a moment to moment basis is one way the body regulates temperature ! That's the sum of all the literature on cold and thyroid. Does swimming in a standard 75 degree pool affect thyroid? Does a hypothyroid person get hypothermia more easily (yes, but does a chilly pool cause it in hypothyroid? Who knows but a standard thermometer would find that out). Basically, these are unknown. Does exercise affect thyroid, yes. Does fasting/starvation ? well, yes, but the extent and what to do about it isn't known. Ok, at 60, increasing the body's resilience to stress will, by tautology make the thyroid normalize. This involves standard exercise, good sleep, and I would include exposure to a wide variety of outdoor environments. Oops, nobody knows this yet, I better get writing.

My only patient likely to get chemo MIGHT show up on it. He has lymphoma. His blood proteins from the lymphoma might go into the urine, thicken it and cause it to falsely bind to everything on the dipstick. UNLIKELY.

(I hope you have discontinued it only after consulting your doctor as per the requirement of your basic disease). Now for your existing symptoms like low back pain, weight gain, I feel you, first of all, get your calcium and vitamin D levels done. if they are low then you can try to increase calcium and vitamin D in your diet. Milk and milk products like cheese and yogurt are excellent sources of calcium. Even seafood, sardine fish, almonds, green leafy vegetables are rich in calcium. The minimum daily requirement of vitamin D is 800 Iu units and calcium is around 1000 mg per day so that must be fulfilled. Avoid smoking and alcohol intake as they further increase the risk of osteoporosis. Go for some exercises like walking, running, swimming. This will help you reduce weight and strengthen your body.be careful about your diet and avoid eating fatty food or junk food.
