For example, you haven't mentioned the reason that prednisolone was prescribed. I do not even know whether you're talking about local treatment (creams) or systemic treatment (pills). I can only make a general comment about prednisolone treatment. Treatment with corticosteroids (like prednisolone) may affect the way the body modulates complex hormonal systems. When a patient takes corticosteroids more often than once every morning, the risk is even higher. Prednisolone can be used once per day, or many times per day depending on the disorder. Therefore there is no right or wrong dosage...I hope I've answered your question.

I have been married for 5 and a half years, but still not able to concieve. 2 years back I had a D & C to remove a polyp due to which I had irregular menstural bleeding. After D & C, my periods have been regulated to some extent. Then about 6 month ago, I had my periods disappeared for 2 months, which on diagnosis doctor determined a cyst in my ovary. she gave me injection of IVF-C 1/m stat and tablet primolute-N for 3days, after which i get my periods back to normal. Now, in order to concieve, my gynaecologist Dr. Shaheen Zaffar gave me Ovi-f for 3 cycles, but still i didnt concieve.

My connective tissues are falling apart, my hips and shoulders dislocate, I vomit a lot due to gut issues, and I m a terrible insomniac with severe anxiety on top of it. Medical marijuana became legal in my state in 2016, and I just got my card a couple weeks ago. However, I am hesitant to tell my huge swath of doctors about this. I know it s unwise to keep medical info from your care team, but there s still such a stigma against marijuana, with people denying its medical value and thinking people just want to get stoned. Since starting, I was able to get off of both the benzo I took for anxiety and panic attacks and the prescription sleeping pill; I ve cut down drastically on the amount of muscle relaxers I m taking, and I finally have an antiemetic that I don t have to swallow while I m nauseous or projectile vomiting. All of these have been positives and what I wanted, and unless it s something for sleep, the strains I m using are keeping me able to function on a normal level. I fear that if I tell my doctors about this, they won t look at me the same way as a patient and think I m just some stoner loser. So is this something I should keep secret for now, or are doctors more enlightened on this subject than I have been lead to believe? Really, I just wanted to get off of so many pills.

I am currently taking 20mg/day and have recently noticed an elevation in glucose levels, and am having trouble controlling them. Blood pressure is elevated lately as well. Could this be due to the Cipralex? Is there another anti-anxiety medication that is more blood sugar-friendly?","Doctor":"Hello,Cipralex may indeed cause blood glucose disorders and blood pressure disorders although both are rare. It may cause both hypo- and hyper- glycemia (the effect cannot be individually predicted) and both hypo- and hyper- tension. Such side effects occur in less than 1% of patients taking 20mg of Cipralex. It has to be even less likely in patients who have been taking it for a year without any side effects. Perhaps your doctor should try to identify other potential causes for your problems. Weight gain and sedentary lifestyle are inciting factors for hyperglycemia, although genetics play a major role in it - some individuals will never develop diabetes no matter how fat they become, others will experience hyperglycemia even when they stay lean. The same factors are important for hypertension as well. Salt consumption is another important factor in this regard. Checking your glucosylated hemoglobin would be recommended. High glucosylated hemoglobin may indicate that treatment for diabetes might be necessary... Regarding your blood pressure. Measuring your blood pressure (at least twice each time) for at least one week will give your doctor a better idea about it. 24-hour blood pressure monitoring (Holter) may be even more accurate in detecting blood pressure issues. So in conclusion, I don't believe that these symptoms are caused by Cipralex - although I can't 100% exclude it. An investigation is required to determine the extent of these issues and whether treatment is required or not. I wouldn't recommend any change to your regimen without discussing the matter with your doctor first. Consequently, I wouldn't recommend any other anti-anxiety medication. A rate of less than 1% for side effects is perfect for any drug and doctors almost never assume that side effects are caused by such a drug - they first have to eliminate all other potential causes.I hope I've answered your question. Please let me know if you need further assistance.Kind Regards,Dr Panagiotis ZografakisInternal Medicine Specialist"},{"Patient":"Hi.

The initial drowsiness and dis orientation can be explained by the electrolyte imbalance . Particulary sodium being on the lower side . Even with correction because of his age it will take sometime for him to come back to complete normal . Quitipin is a drug which in its side effect can cause some drowsiness , so if persistant you may have a talk with your doctor and maybe stop it for sometime as its not a essential cardiac medicine .

Primarily, it has a direct stimulating (agonistic) effect on H1 receptors located on blood vessels in the inner ear. This gives rise to local vasodilation and increased permeability, which helps to reverse the underlying problem of endolymphatic hydrops.More importantly, betahistine has a powerful antagonistic effects at H3 receptors, thereby increasing the levels of neurotransmitters histamine, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and GABA released from the nerve endings. The increased amounts of histamine released from histaminergic nerve endings can stimulate receptors. This stimulation explains the potent vasodilatory effects of betahistine in the inner ear, that are well documented.Betahistine seems to dilate the blood vessels within the inner ear which can relieve pressure from excess fluid and act on the smooth muscle.It is postulated that betahistine's increase in the level of serotonin in the brainstem inhibits the activity of vestibular nuclei.so  for acute phase of dizziness vertin was ok but now as primary problem of your mother was hypertension ,not labyrinthine disorder betahistine should be stoppped and she should be maintained on a dose of telmisartan on which her b.p is normalthanks"},{"Patient":"My name is Regina, I have my mum who is seriously sick almost a month now.

Avoid binge eating, spicy foods and you can be prescribed a proton pump inhibitor like pantoprazole along with a prokinetic agent like domperidone if required. 2) There is a chance that a regular ECG isn't picking up some abnormalities, so if you want to be double sure, you can ask for hotter monitoring that basically tracks your ECG over 24 hours.

Renal angiography is considered better.Secondly increase in the muscle of the heart ( LVH- left vventricular hypertrophy) is a result of increased BP for a long time.Consider reducing salt in diet, stop smoking if u are doing so, do regular exercise & take medicine regularly.ThanksDr Sameer MaheshwariCardiologist, Fortis Hospital"},{"Patient":"Tonite my 51 year old mother in law collapsed, we thought it was a seizure and in 5 minutes we were doing cpr because she stopped breathing and had no pulse.

If the calcium is more  than 100 calcium it's likely to have heart atack ,higher is the score , the higher are the chances to have heart atack.The good thing of having these examinations  is that we can low the chance of further complications to happend (heart atack) with proper medication and lifestyle changes .The doctor will check the cholesterol level to see if you need medication for that.Yes eating healthy ( reduce salt, fatty food) and  regular excercises are very good for the heart and will help for the problem so incoutage him to do that.Wish these help.If you have any other questions  please feel free to ask me ."},{"Patient":"Im  33 years old female.. for past few months been getting \\"skipped heart beat\\" which I went to cardiologist and was told I have PVC's.. did EKG and was told to cut down caffeine intake.

Thank you for posting your questions here.Yes  its true Caffeine can increase the risk of having PCV or exstrasystoles.  Caffeine stimulate you nervous system to produce more adrenaline and this will  effect  the heart in the end having exstrasystoles. Coffe is good of making  you feel awake but when you  use in high dosage will have negative effect in your body ( like the heart rhythm  problem you have .)

My blood pressure sometime shoots up to 220/145. I am taking a lot of medicines for blood pressure and chest pain. Please advise what to do?.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank your for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to irreversible changes in the retinal artery, causing troubles with the vision. Coming to this point, a better control of blood pressure values would help stop the progression of these changes. You should also know that with such blood pressure values, you are at an increased risk for stroke, heart attack or intracranial bleeding. So, I would recommend discussing with your doctor on the possibility of optimizing your current anti-hypertensive therapy. Some blood tests are needed to exclude secondary causes of uncontrolled high blood pressure: - complete blood count for anemia- thyroid hormone levels for possible thyroid dysfunction- blood electrolytes for electrolyte imbalance - kidney and liver function tests - fasting glucose and HbA1C. You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues!Kind regards, Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"hi My mother is 64 and her blood preasure is 186/111 she is allready on medication for her blood preasure.and her doctor increased one of her medications and told me to call him tommorow. should she consider going to the doctor or should we wait until tommorow. she said she feels alot of preassure in her head but so far thats it .what should we do?she weigh 213.and is 5'4","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that her blood pressure values are high, which means that her current anti-hypertensive therapy is not very effective in controlling blood pressure. I agree with your her doctor on the decision of increasing the doses of her current anti-hypertensive drugs. But, if her blood pressure values do now lower with this changes to her current medication, considering the fact that she has a lot of pressure in her head, I would recommend bringing her to the ER, in order to lower her blood pressure values.

But, the sedentary life that you make by staying sat before the computer most of the day is a known cardio-vascular risk factor. Anyway a single blood pressure values is not sufficient for the diagnosis of high blood pressure.So, I would recommend you to closely monitor your blood pressure in the next week, two times daily (usually in sitting position after 10 minutes of total relax) and refer those values to your doctor. I would also advise performing some tests to investigate for the possible underlying causes:- a resting ECG- a chest X ray study- kidney and liver function tests- complete blood count for anemia- thyroid hormone levels for possible thyroid dysfunction- blood electrolytes for possible imbalance- PCR, sedimentation rate for inflammation.You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues. Antihypertensive drugs may be needed if your blood pressure values are most of the time above 135/85 mmHg.I would also recommend some tips to help maintain a normal blood pressure:- reduce salt and caffeine intake- perform a lot of physical activity- try to lose some pounds.Hope you will find this answer helpful!Kind regards,Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, I am 68 yrs old with type 2 diabetes since 2yrs with hypertension since one year and using dutasteride related Tablets. 10 days back I had severe chest pain for ten minutes while I was vacuuming the house.I had stress and echo tests .It is opinioned possibility of apical ischaemia.Could you please give some advice Doctor.

Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker and this particular type of drug is associated with peripheral edema or swelling of legs and ankles. If it is troublesome for you, ask your attending physician if it is possible to shift your current medication to other drugs, like Losartan.

It seems that the hypertension is not your problem in this situation. Seems to me that you have a difficulty in dealing  and controlling your emotions and temper towards other people. Physiologically, intense anger, frustration and stress can at the same time  elevate blood pressure.

I would also advise performing some blood lab tests (complete blood count for anemia, thyroid hormone levels for possible dysfunction, blood electrolytes) to exclude other possible metabolic causes that may cause a heart murmur. Regarding masturbation, I would not recommend soap as it can be irritating for the mucosa. There are a lot of lubrication  gels which you can buy in the pharmacy for this purpose.

His medication consists of: Simvastatin, Carvedilil, Rampril, Aspirin and Furosemide.  For the last two weeks he has incredibly painful periods of joint pain - gout.

I thought we had it under control but he has had another nasty outbreak in his wrist (caused by the meat?).  What I am wondering is whether it is worth altering his diet at all from what it was before these gout episodes as it seems that a side effect of the tablets is to raise the uric acid levels in his blood.  Does the diet help enough to make any difference or is the only way for him to get relief is to take more tablets (we are getting other tablets today). Regards Mark","Doctor":"Hi Dear User !

But a single blood pressure values is not indicative of arterial hypertension. It can be related also to physical or emotional stress. Even taking a lot of caffeine or salt can lead to these blood pressure values.

I am 24 years old, 5'2\\" and 125 lbs. 5 years ago, I came to Colorado from Florida and weighed 180 lbs, yet I seemed to be in better shape than I am now. My primary care tested me for anemia and blood clots and had a chest X-ray done. She then sent me to a pulmonologist, who gave me a full PFT, echo, and methacholine challenge. Everything was normal, but the pulmonologist noticed that I had consistently high pulse rates (around 98 on both visits). The first visit, he had me go up a flight of stairs and my pulse went to 125. On the second visit, he was about to send me home and tell me I was just out of shape and need to exercise, but sent me to a cardiologist after he checked my pulse (after sitting in the waiting room for 40 minutes, it was 98). My resting pulsing rate used to be 70-75 but has since gone to 80-105. It typically raises dramatically when I do activity (like 135 just walking 15 feet),  but these high readings aren't consistent. Some days I can go up the stairs and my pulse goes up to 110. Other days, it'll go up to 160. Is it really possible that I'm that out of shape at my age AND some days are better than others? I'm not super active but at the minimum, I'm on my feet running around at work 8 hours a day 2-3 days a week, which is more activity than a friend around my age.

Another possibility to take into consideration is gastro-esophageal reflux. I recommend taking some antiacids before sleep.

I m male, 35 yrs, 184 cm tall, weighing 92 kg. I never had any heart-related symptoms until a year ago when i started feeling my PVC s (Don t know if they existed before, but nothing had been detected earlier). They were at a low frequency(Report said: Rare), detected by 24-hr holter. Did tests for TSH, and minerals which indicated low Vitamin D and phosphorus. 24-hr urine test showed no excess depletion of phosphorous. Took all those results to cardiologist and he said there s no cause for concern. The PVC s faded for a while and returned in late May. The cardiologist then asked for an echo stress test, which showed normal heart function. Again, the PVC s faded all by themselves. The doc put me on Concor COR 2.5 though because he said this would help maintain a healthier pulse in a stressful work environment. I ve been having PVC s lately again, for the last 3 weeks now. They ve become more frequent. Today for about 4 hours i was having 6-7 PVC s in a minute. After that, they almost faded (by noon, almost 2 hours after my Concor pill). My last doctor trip was only a week ago when he asked me for an echocardiogram. He said the result was normal based on verbal communication he received from the doctor who made the assessment. Looking at it, i can see a few things: 1- Filling Pressure E / A : 1.3 (normal = 1) 2- Mitral DTE : 199 ms (normal = 152 - 180) 3- It says Trivial tricuspid regurgitation, but normal morphology and leaflet motion Otherwise, all is normal. FYI Ejection Fraction = 60-64% Any cause for concern for the above? I went to my GP today, and asked him to give me a full-blown blood/urine analysis for anything that may be related and for my general medical health. Does the increase in PVC frequency merit some other action? at what point should i consider going to the emergency?? Note, I m sitting right now and feeling absolutely nothing. It seems like someone turned the switch off. The PVC s would most likely start again tomorrow morning when i wake up and last for a good 3-4 hours. Is this the time it takes for Concor to kick in? This has been happening the last 5 days. This wasn t the case before though.","Doctor":"There is nothing to be concerned about...PVCs is a benign condition..you may increase you concor to 5 mg once at the morning...thats all"},{"Patient":"Hi First let me say that I have been to the cardiologist on very occassions and the last time I went (my regular physican recommended a follow-up visit because I hadn t been in a while and supposedly I have what they call a bicuspid valve.

My concern that I shared with him was that every once in a while all of a sudden my heart starts like flutterly pretty strongly and will go on for a few minutes I get very weak and my arms seem very heavy when this occurs. My visit was just before my daughters wedding (as he suggested just to be sure all is ok, that I could go for a stress test and also possibly wear a monitor) I advised it would probably be after wedding and he indicated there was no urgency.

Depending on the specific congenital heart abnormality, some people need multiple surgeries during childhood or into young adulthood, to account for the natural growing process that occurs.Additionally, some valve replacements can wear out and the valves become \\"insufficient\\" or \\"leaky\\" over time.  You don't say whether you have any cardiac or pulmonary symptoms.At the very least, an Echocardiogram (Heart sonogram) should be done to look at your heart chambers and heart valves.  Since a roller coaster can be a cardiologically stressful situation, they may wish to do an Exercise Stress Test to measure how your heart responds to physical stress.  Assuming your medical history, physical exam, and Echo and Stress Test turned out OK, there shouldn't be a contraindication to riding a roller coaster.  However, if there is a problem--fluid or pressure buildup in parts of the heart, or a tendency to develop arrhythmias under physically stressful conditions, there could be problems with a roller coaster.  Speak to your Cardiologist first, and wait for his or her assessment before buying your next roller coaster ticket."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have hbp, I take 5mg lisinopril and 6.5 Carvedilol twice a day, my bp in the morning is low 114 70 average and stays low until around 4pm, at around 6 pm goes up to 150 90 average and stays up til I go o bed. I take my my meds at 7am and 7pm. Should I take meds differently?","Doctor":"You may want to take your 2nd daily dose of Carvedilol in the mid-afternoon, like around 3 or 4 PM, instead of waiting till 7 pm.  The morning dose is starting to wear off by the time you notice your BP rising, so I would suggest trying the 2nd dose earlier.  Good luck.  Keep us posted with what happens."},{"Patient":"I have been experiencing burning skin, heart palpitations and and insomnia. I am 44 female. Had blood work, heart work including ekg, stress test and ct of brain with and without contrast also lung xray. All came back normal. What is missing? Could it be hormones? Vitamin issues? I have no appetite and my mouth is unusually dry. Thanks for your input.mn","Doctor":"You say you've had a complete cardiac workup to evaluate your symptoms.  You don't say if you are still menstruating or not, or having any change in the regularity of your menstrual pattern.  The symptoms of burning skin, palpitations, and insomnia certainly CAN be symptoms of peri-menopause, which is a strong possibility in a 44 year old woman.  Your primary doctor or gynecologist should send your blood for what I call a \\"Lady Hormone Panel,\\" which checks to see if the LH (Leuteinizing Hormone) and FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) levels are abnormally high, and checks the Estrogen and Progesterone levels.  Sometimes, the Anti-Muellerian Hormone level is checked also.  These can tell at what point in the monthly menstrual cycle you are in, and whether or not you are close to menopause.  All 3 symptoms you described can occur in peri-menopause or \\"the change of life,\\"  as it is sometimes called.There are herbal and/or pharmaceutical medicines that can be used to help settle down the sometimes-disturbing symptoms of peri-menopause.  The burning skin you refer to is sometimes described as a \\"hot flash\\" or \\"flushing.\\"Good luck.  Let us know how things work out for you."},{"Patient":"I had a protected sex with sex worker about 50 days ago, I started to feel strange things 2 weeks after intercourse like high blood pressure sore throat dizziness , I went to urologist and general practitioner doctor, I had did blood test and STD test and urine test.in blood test I saw elevation of white blood cells and in urine test they said there is blood in urine, STD test was negative.I was prescribed Cipro antibiotic.I repeated Urine test and it was good .I dont know from where this if there was no bacteria in urine as the test said.My throat was still sore, I went to throat doctor (ENT), He said it is due acid reflux (I had it year ago), and I was adviced for gastroenterology Dr.  anyway I afraid of HIV and worry, I'm feeling myself weak and sneezing too much.I did HIV test after 28 days, It was Negative.My problem is that My wife will be back in 8 days here to me and for sure she know nothing about being such guilty person and I dont know what to do, If I'm positive or not?..I can not tell her I can not use condom with herit is problemis there any test can give accurate results before her coming or no need for test or what?!!!!!","Doctor":"The hypertension is probably due to anxiety and guilt.  If the ENT doctor did a laryngoscopy and looked at the vocal cords, they could see if there was evidence of either infection or of \\"reflux laryngitis.\\"  So, an type 2 anti-histamine (like ranitidine or famotidine) or proton pump inhibitor (like omeprazole or pantoprozole) medicine usually helps with the sore throat from reflux.  It can take up to 6 months to sero-convert from an HIV exposure; in other words, for your body to produce antibodies to HIV that would be detectable on a blood test.  If you were negative after 28 days, that's great; however, you need to be re-tested at 3 months and 6 months.There are 2 other tests that might give you an answer more quickly.  One is a PCR for HIV Viral Load test, which may detect the RNA of the actual HIV virus, if it is floating around in your blood stream.  Another possibly helpful test is a CD4 and CD8 count, which counts 2 specific subtypes of T-lymphocytes.  This is more a measure of whether the HIV virus has adversely affected your T-cells, rather than a count of the virus itself.  It is less important in your situation, unless you've had other possible exposures to the virus.  Until you know your HIV status, it is morally and ethically your obligation to wear a condom to protect your wife from receiving HIV from you.  Or abstain from having sex with her.  It is possible to have the virus, but to not produce antibodies yet (what I said previously about sometimes taking up to 6 months to \\"seroconvert.\\").  I know these are difficult decisions and conversations to picture having, but the alternative of playing \\"Russian Roulette\\" with her life and having unprotected sex with her while gambling on whether or not you have HIV is a horrible thing to knowingly do to your wife.  In some jurisdictions, there can be criminal charges to knowingly transmit the virus to a sex partner without telling them that you have it or have been exposed.  See if your doctor can send you for that HIV Viral Load PCR test, or if you can see an Infectious Diseases specialist who can help counsel you on testing, safe sex practices, and helping guide you to appropriate counseling if you need to tell your wife.Good luck to you."},{"Patient":"my dad went into a cardiac arrest and is still in the hospital and has severe diarriah right now and they did a test on him and it showed he has black colon and they say he might need surgury. My dad has a very weak heart and I just want to know if he even should have this surgury or what else is there to do to treat his black colon","Doctor":"\\"Black colon\\" may refer to ischemic colitis.  When there is a lack of blood supply to an organ such as the large intestine (colon), the tissues turn dark, or in the worst case, blackened, if it dies or becomes \\"necrotic.\\"  That is a medical emergency, and needs to be treated with immediate emergency surgery.  Considering that he as a \\"very weak heart\\" and just suffered a cardiac arrest, the odds, unfortunately, are very much against him.  He has a very high chance of complications or death related to the surgery.  However, there is no alternative, as leaving an ischemic or necrotic colon in him has a 100% chance of causing septic shock and a very painful death.  I'm sorry to hear of your Dad's situation, and I wish you and him the best of luck in trying to get through this.  Any chance he has of survival would include an emergency, high-risk operation to remove the \\"blackened\\" portions of his colon and to restore blood flow to this vital organ.  The only other alternative, unfortunately, would be to refuse surgery, sign DNR papers, and make him as comfortable as possible.  That decision, of course, would be determined by him if he is awake and alert and understands the situation, or, if he does not, then hopefully he has a \\"Living Will,\\" outlining the type of aggressive, life-saving measures he would or would not like to undergo.  These type of questions are things that are best dealt with ahead of time, when our loved ones are alert and healthy and can make their wishes (or \\"advanced directives\\") known.  It also helpful for them to appoint an official \\"Health Care Proxy,\\" a spouse or adult child or other relative who knows and understands their philosophies and wishes regarding health care in these life-threatening situations.

As you are taking levothyroxine, it would be necessary check your thyroid hormone levels to regulate the dose of levothyroxine.2- Other secondary causes of high blood pressure should be excluded. That is why I would recommend performing some other blood tests : - complete blood count for anemia- liver and kidney function tests for possible dysfunction- fasting glucose for diabetes- blood electrolytes for possible imbalance- inflammation tests (PCR, sedimentation rate). 3- If all the above mentioned tests result normal, primary hypertension should be taken into consideration. In such case, you should discuss with your doctor on the possibility of starting anti-hypertensive therapy.

You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues.Another advice I would give is to try taking an antiacid or a PPI (omeprazole, lansoprazole).

Now coming back to Blood pressure reading of 110/40 you are having, i would recommend you to do self monitoring of Blood pressure (BP) at least 2 times a day at different times of day for 5 days, one can use these BP readings to come to a conclusion. Regarding reading of 110/40, your upper blood pressure (systolic- measures the pressure in arteries when the heart beats) reading is normal but lower BP reading (diastolic- measures the pressure in arteries between beats) of 40 mm Hg is low. A systolic blood pressure reading of 90 mm Hg or less or a diastolic reading of 60 mm Hg or less is generally considered low blood pressure (hypotension).       Two circumstances typically can result in extremely low diastolic blood pressure. 1- Severe hypotension-  number of medical conditions may cause severe hypotension including heart problems which prevent circulation of blood in body, underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) or overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) beside other conditions. Some medications may also cause hypotension.           Other conditions, including dehydration, blood loss, significant infection and a severe allergic reaction may cause severe hypotension. But these disorders usually cause a sudden, dramatic and temporary drop in blood pressure, rather than a sustained low blood pressure reading over time.2-  profoundly stiff arteries that occur due to aging, diabetes or fatty buildup in the arteries (atherosclerosis).   So i would like to know whether or not you are taking any medications, are there any other symptoms like palpitation (unusual awareness of ones heart beat), sweating, unusual weight loss  or increase in weight, cold or hot intolerance, decrease or increase in appetite and family history of any  chronic disease like diabetes and hypertension.   If your diastolic blood pressure is consistently below 60, and you aren't experiencing problems as a result, treatment might not be required. If low blood pressure is causing symptoms such as dizziness, light-headedness or fainting more investigation may be required to know the cause.   What you can do to increase your BP is to take normal amount of salt, drink plenty of water and use compression stockings.Hope this has helped youRegards"},{"Patient":"I am a 58 yr old woman.....my blood pressure is always good...but my pulse rate is always high....I do drink...like right now had a couple and pulse rate 125.....this morning was 100...i only have a few drinks in the evening every other night but pulse always 100 or more","Doctor":"it can be a normal increased heart rate (sinus tachycardia) or abnormal heart beat called arrythmiai would advice you get a ecg doneif ecg reveals it to be a sinus tachycardia then taketab propranolol 10mg twice daily for a monthin case ecg shows arrytmia then you have to undrgo multiple tests !!!"},{"Patient":"my husband is 49 yrs,5.4 ft tall. his cholestral test is normal and bp is under control.,140/80 and sugar level is 97 during fasting , but the doctore says that he has problem in v4 and v6 and he has to go in for angiogram.his total cholestral is 140,tryglycerides is 100, ldl is 80 and hdl is 41. twice ecg was taken, still the doctor insists for angiogram","Doctor":"no even if lead v5and v6 show some unspecified problem(u have not mentioned)angiography is not at all indicated2d echo cardiogarphy should be done to see the blood supply to heart walls and a tread mill test should be done to see the response of blood supply to exerciseangiography is never indicated in asymptomatic patients with mild changes in two leadsin case some ischemia is seen in tmt or 2d echo....stress thallim test should be done....if some thing is still reflected itsxa indication of angiographydont worry get a 2d echo and tread mill test done thanks"},{"Patient":"me 52 y old ,hightis 165cm.waight-110kg,my problomis .BP high,110....and ...195 dgr me take medication  one tblt-coversyl. 5mg.and one tblt-asprien after 3 day Note.y my BP id not going down .this is my problom .wht i do more ,pls info me ,,razanasir.","Doctor":"eat low salt dietexercise daily for 45minutes at least starttab losar h 50mg 9amtab metolar xr (metoprolol) 25mg twice dailytab ecosprin av 75/10mg once at nightmonitor bp every 5th dayadv tests are2d echotmtkft"},{"Patient":"i am prescribed olvance-40 and tonact tg for my high BP & triglyceroid 356.

It is approved for treatment of excessive day time sleepiness. If you had walked into my clinic i would have Known your Age and would have taken history of any hypertension, Diabetes, Panic attack, chest pain, thyroid disorder. The cause of Rapidly beating heart and anxiety in your case may be-Overdose of Nuvigil-  It presents as severely increased or decreased heart rate, chest pain, and increased blood pressure.Panic Attack- It can also present as rapidly beating heart, difficulty in breathing and anxiety. Acute Exacerbation of Asthma- Acute attack of asthma too may have similar features.Heart disease- heart diseases may also present with difficulty in breathing, increase heart rate and tightness in chest.      To differentiate between them i would order some investigations. To rule out any heart disease i would order Chest X- Ray ECG and ECHO. I would also advice fasting and post postprandial blood sugar level. I would  also advice my patient to breath into a paper bag which is covering their nose and mouth if these symptoms occur after a stressful event (for panic attack) and if possible to do some yoga and meditation. I would also like to take history of asthma medication my patient is taking and would like to auscultate my patients chest to look for wheezing (it is a sound which comes from chest when you hear the chest using stethoscope) and would also like to know if these symptoms become worse with change in season.  I would also like to know the dose of Nuvigil you are taking and whether or not it is the right dose.      Once i have found out the cause of your symptoms i would advice medication for that particular condition. If it is due to over dosage  Nuvigil i would lower the dose of Nuvigil and if it is panic attack i would advice breathing exercise through paper bag.

I just had a treadmill test, and then an echo cardiogram performed. Although I am experiencing no chest pains (never have had a heart attack, but my father died from one at age 60) and my cholesterol levels are excellent (I m on Lipitor), both the treadmill and ECG were abnormal. My doctor did suspect the treadmill to be a false positive as I had gotten well above my maximum heart rate. He said one of the atrial walls on the 8 picture ECG wasn t bouncing closed as all the others, which he said looked excellent. He thought there was a chance that could even be attributed to a badly placed sensor, but even so he wants me to have an angiogram, saying there s a 2-5% chance of a partial blockage. Of course, I m reluctant to have anything so invasive performed (and don t like the expense) if it could be avoided. He says my insurance would not pay for a re-test, but I m wondering if I should ask him for a referral for a second opinion before the scheduled angiogram on Wednesday (in just 5 days).

Does tricuspid valve regurgitation caused her atrial fibrillation?","Doctor":"Hey,Regarding the answers to your question1) AF is a very common cause of stroke. It may remain undetected for years and may present first time as stroke when the ecg shows af. So yes it may be old which has caused stroke2) Mild TR generally does not cause any problem and may be physiological in some patients. IT DOES NOT CAUSE AF untill any chamber of the heart is dilated because of significant TR. As your mother is diabetic and hypertensive, she is at high risk of coronary disease, which may cause AF.So ruling out that is also important after she is stabilised.

I can understand your concern.Fatigue ,sweating,weakness can be symptoms of hypoglicemia.Hypoglicemia is more frequent in older diabetics with insulin.Shivering may be due to fever caused by infection.My advice is  to do some fasting and random measurements of blood glucose with glocometer and to consult an endocrinologist because your mother may need to adjust the dose of insuline accordingly to glicemic results.I suggest to do the blood panel(expecially white blood cells)to see if there is any infection that cause shivering and than to meet your GP for the right diagnose and treatement.If your mother's blood pressure is not balanced with several antihypertensive drugs this means that the drug are not working and she need to consult a cardiologist to adjust the dose or maybe to give another treatement for her high blood pressure.Hope I have answered your question.

Any ideas?","Doctor":"You don't say how long ago his heart surgery was.  If it was within the past week, some patients will have local swelling of the lips, perhaps from mild trauma or irritation from the endotracheal tube being in the mouth or moving around a little or sometimes the patient biting on the tube and/or his lip while sedated or unconscious.  That should subside naturally over the course of a week.It is also possible he might be allergic to latex, a component of the tape glue that is usually used to secure the tube during intubation to prevent it from moving around or inadvertently coming out.  That usually subsides when the tube and tape are removed.If the tube have been out awhile without improvement, or if the lip swelling is continuing past a week or so, then his doctors should review his medication list for drugs that he might be allergic to.  A common cause of lip swelling are drugs in the ACE Inhibitor class, such as Captopril, Lisinopril, Benazepril. Withdrawing or stopping these blood pressure or heart failure drugs usually will cause the lip swelling to stop fairly quickly.

Panic attacks can be triggered by different stimuli, or they can be also unexpected which are unrelated to such triggers. Symptoms of a panick attack are palpitation, accelerated heart rate, sweating, shortness of breath, chest tightness and discomfort, nausea, dizziness, fainting, numbness and tingling sensation especially in the extremities, fear of loosing control, fera of dying.

Has had quadruple bi-pass surgery. Three stents inserted with one failure and replaced. He is a white 50 year old. High blood pressure. Also, needs knee joint replacement, but they keep discouraging him from having the surgery. He keeps telling me he is not going to live long and I need to be prepared for this. His heart surgery was in 2007. Please give me an average life expectancy of people who have been through what he has. It s uncomfortable talking to him about it. I m going to be married to him soon, I need answers. Thank you Kelli","Doctor":"Hi, Kelli.  That is a difficult and complicated question to answer.  He has severe premature coronary artery disease.  There are 2 important pieces of information I would want in order to help answer your question--the most important is: What is his Ejection Fraction (EF)?  That is the \\"muscle strength number\\" of his heart.  Has he just had blocked arteries treated with surgery and stents?  Or has he had heart attack damage to his heart muscle?  It is the latter, not the former, that greatly reduces a person's life expectancy.  The 2nd question is:  At what age did his parents die?  Cardiac disease and cardiac mortality seems to be hereditary, although there are many factors involved, and many more treatment advances in medicines, cardiac interventions, and cardiac surgeries between his generation and his parents' generation that have improved survival for this generation vs. previous ones.One study from the Mayo clinic showed that in patients with 3-vessel cardiac disease (blockages in all 3 major coronary arteries) and a normal EF (normal is usually considered between 60-75%), the 5-year survival rate was about 90%.  With 3 vessel disease and an EF between 35-50%, it was about 70%.  With 3-vessel disease and an EF under 35%, it drops to about 50%.Of course, much depends on luck and medical care.  Does he see his doctors regularly?  Is he on \\"standard-of-care\\" medications that are proven to help reduce future cardiac events and/or decrease his mortality rate?  These include beta blockers, statins, ACE Inhibitors (especially if he's diabetic or has had heart attacks or reduced EF), aspirin, maybe other anti-platelet drugs.  Has he stopped smoking (or even better, never smoked)?  Does he have diabetes (diabetics have higher death and complication rates in general and for many specific complications)?  Is it well-controlled if he does?  Does he have a defibrillator (AICD) if his EF is at or below 30%?As much as we know about mortality risks from chronic ischemic heart disease and chronic left ventricular dysfunction, there is much we don't understand.  Two people can have the same combination of diseases, the same cardiac history, the same heart surgeries, the same EF's--and one can have severe symptoms while the other is \\"well-compensated\\" and has no symptoms and a much better quality of life.  Even with those survival percentage graphs, we may know a percentage number, but we never know for sure who will wind up in which percentage group.  All we can do is make sure the people take care of themselves, exercise regularly under the supervision of their doctor, lose weight, refrain from smoking, take the correct combination of mortality-improving medications regularly, and give themselves the best chance of doing well and surviving.  The rest is up to G-d or fate or whatever.Congratulations, Kelli, on your engagement, and good luck to you and your fiancee.  While these conversations are always uncomfortable, they are important, and, since you will soon be graduating from his fiancee to his wife, you have every right to open a conversation with him about it.  Chances are, if he loves you enough to warn you as he did, he'd love you enough to be honest about sharing with you what his doctors have told him.  You could also ask him if he'd mind if you accompany him to his next doctor's visit.  I have plenty of patients who bring their fiancees or spouses with them.

I was admitted to bergan mercy for an a-fib attack. all the tests were normal-ie-sonogram, I have never had high blood pressure and now on cardizem and coumadin. Prior to being admitted I was drinking alot, not eating right, smoking pot, I quit cigarettes 2 months ago,having profuse night sweats, adhd- I could not sit still, can t sleep, wife snores, lots of stress. i will have a stress test next week. I cannot tolerate the cardizem, and want to find a cardiologist who would understand that I have a magnesium deficiency and not a diltiazem deficiency. Is there a nutritional cardiologist in Omaha that can get me off this stuff and back on track.","Doctor":"Hi, Michael.  Congratulations on quitting smoking.  That's quite an accomplishment.  It is difficult but certainly worthwhile for your health.  A-fib, or Atrial Fibrillation, can be aggravated by stress, electrolyte deficiencies (usually potassium, but sometimes calcium or magnesium), caffeine and other stimulant drugs, and binge-drinking of alcohol. If your heart sonogram (or Echocardiogram) is normal, showing normal heart chamber sizes and normal valvular function, that usually lowers the risk of recurrent A-Fib.  You don't say whether your heart rhythm went back to normal or whether it is still fibrillating (an important distinction in deciding whether we can stop or need to continue certain heart drugs).  Cardizem, a brand of Diltiazem, is one drug that we sometimes use to either slow the rapid pulse of A-Fib or to help maintain normal rhythm.  You should tell your doctor what side effects you feel or why you feel you \\"cannot tolerate the cardizem.\\"  There are other classes of drugs that could be tried to maintain normal rhythm.  If you can stop drinking alcohol, it is possible that you could be observed or have a 24-hour EKG monitor to screen you for recurrent A-Fib, without being on a drug unless the arrhythmia returns.  You could try to search for either another Cardiologist or perhaps an Electrophysiologist (or \\"Cardiac Electrophysiologist).  Those doctors I call \\"Arrhythmia Specialists,\\" and they can monitor or treat you with specialty expertise.  The Electrophysiologist can also recommend or perform an EPS test to search for the abnormal electrical pathway that triggers your A-Fib; this invasive test can be followed by an Ablation, in which the doctor \\"burns\\" that electrical wire within the heart to try to prevent the A-Fib from recurring.  For people who have side effects or drug intolerances from anti-arrhythmic drugs, an ablation can successfully prevent recurrence and remove the necessity to take medicine, since burning out the pathway that caused the arrhythmia has a very high success rate for preventing future occurrences.  If the electrical wire is removed/burnt/ablated, then there is no need to take a medicine to \\"calm it down\\" or keep that wire inactive.  Good luck to you."},{"Patient":"When I only look to the right I get dizzy and have a pounding (like i feel my heartbeat) in my head. Only when I turn to the right. It started yesterday.

Do I need to see a chiropractor and get adjusted or is something else possibly wrong ?","Doctor":"I would recommend seeing a Neurologist or an Otolaryngologist (ENT specialist--Ear, Nose, and Throat), rather than a chiropractor.  What you describe sounds possibly like vertigo, a condition that occurs due to an abnormal interaction between the body's balance system in the inner ear and the nerves that conduct those impulses to the brain.  There are medications and certain exercises that can treat this condition--if that's what a workup and evaluation proves it is.  There are several other possibilities as well, so the evaluation should begin soon with a history and physical exam by your physician, who may possibly want to check an MRI of the head and inner ear; a hearing test; or certain head, neck, or eye-moving maneuvers to try to confirm the diagnosis.  Good luck."},{"Patient":"Hi Dr. Grief, Today I got my blood pressure tested after drinking a cup of icy fruit drink. I found the results were like high blood pressure: 148/87.

Thanks.","Doctor":"Generally, there is nothing about eating or drinking that would raise a person's blood pressure.  If the icy fruity drink was a margarita, then the salt could raise your blood pressure.  Salty foods or drinks will raise your BP; conversely, cutting down or eliminating these will lower BP.  Also, caffeine, such as that contained in coffee, iced coffee, iced teas, most teas, or \\"energy drinks\\" will certainly raise BP.  Caffeine and other stimulants, such as those contained in some decongestants or some medications used to treat ADHD can raise BP."},{"Patient":"Respected Sir, I am from from Kolkata.

I have gone through your question and I understand your concern.Yes the doctors that recommended that are right , Your father need a Aortic valvule replacement.In the case that the Aortic stenosis  is severe  means that the heart is working hard to pump the blood into the vessels and this condition  makes the heart muscles weak .The heart can't effort the obstruction caused by the aortic stenosis and in the end this will lead to heart failure and less and less blood in the vessels (all the body will suffer from leak of oxygen .)

The heart murmur has not any clinical significance, considering your symptomatology. For this reason, I would recommend performing further tests to investigate for the possible underlying causes: - a chest X ray study - a cervico-thoracic spine X ray study for possible bulging disk which may cause irradiating pain in this region- inflammation tests (PCR, sedimentation rate, complete blood count). If all the above tests result normal, you should consider anxiety as a possible cause of this symptoms, because it may mimic all this clinical scenario.

Last year still 100% closed.  He had mini stroke symptoms recently and now they say in the last few months the so called 100% closed atery is having blood flow.  Is this good or bad news that suddenly its flowing blood again?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that as this artery was 100% closed, his brain has functioned without it during this time. This has happened using the collateral blood circulation, which are small branches that connect different arteries in the brain. It is true that when an artery is 100% closed, it causes a brain stroke and there is no need to open it again, as the consequences are irreversible. From the other hand, it happens during dissection of the artery that the blood flow may start again. This is a good thing, because it helps the collateral circulation function better. From the other hand, as there are dead brain cells, hemorrhages can occur in this damaged area of the brain. That is why it is important maintaining a normal blood pressure and avoid possible spikes in blood pressure which can lead to hemorrhage. Hope you will find this answer helpful!Best wishes, Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"yesterday i was sitting reading my mail went I all of a sudden started getting light headed, dizzy, my heart rate rapidly increased, when I took my bp it was 99/61 and my pulse was up to 162 which.

Also I was feeling light-headed - less so this morning -which is why I went to the pharmacy.My family doctor is now on holiday. Should I investigate further?","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern.That blood pressure is low indeed. Of course if it persists it should be investigated with evaluation of heart function through EKG and ultrasonography. However before that since you are under a blood pressure lowering pill like Amlodipine, if low values persist then first step would be to interrupt that medication, Amlodipine, and monitor blood pressure. It is likely that simply by interrupting Amlodipin and staying well hydrated no further intervention will actually be needed.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"I am a female, 56 age and diagnosed as having mild AR or aortic regurgitation. in recent years i suddenly suffer from breathing trouble particularly during night and this occurs 2-3 times in a year.

The relevance of single reading of BP is very low unless it has significant symptoms associated with it and attributable to it.2. There are many more factors adversely influencing the BP like Steroids, Sudafed, white coat etc. We have to  remove such inciting inciting factors and take multiple readings of BP before we could decide anything about them.

Excess secretion from this gland can cause high bp which is a very common cause.3) Hyperthyroidism - high thyroid can also increase bpThere are several other causes but these are most common.If these are detected and treated properly you will not need medicine for bp.I am suggesting some tests - Renal Doppler, Thyroid profile, USG whole abdomen, KFT & 24 hr urinary VMA.Till than you have to take medicine.

This sequence of events usually occur before a fever develops. -Did you check his temperature at that time? -does he have any other signs of infection or any other symptoms?-any medical problems? Is he on any medications? Sometimes stress during the day can cause a transient increase in heart rate. If symptoms persists or recurs, please consult his physician for an electrocardiogram. Holter monitoring for 24 hrs may be required to catch the heart during such episodes to find out the rhythm abnormality. He may also need some tests to check for any chemical abnormalities in his blood that could be triggering these episodes If it doesn't recur, then don't worry about it.

Could this be related to his blood pressure drops?  (He is being seen by multiple doctors.)","Doctor":"Hello, Thank you for your query. I will address concerns one by one. 1)low heart rate - yes a rate of 42 is low and a cause for concern especially if it associated with low blood pressure. This is most likely due to the medications and needs to be monitored by his treating doctor for adjustments in dosage. 2) bruising is not normal and means that there is a clotting problem. Large bleeds can cause a fall in blood pressure. This again is most likely due to the medications (blood thinners). This again needs to be monitored by tests and dosage needs to be frequently titration to suit his needs. Please talk to his physician and cardiologist. Certain medications, interact with each other and when taken together have an additive effect. Please discuss this with both clinicians.

It would be a serious issue with or without the heart issue as it can release emboli in the circulation which may block lung vessels, a pulmonary embolism. In people with a hole in the heart, where some blood circulates from the right heart chambers directly to the left without passing into the lungs, the above mentioned clots may pass to the left side and besides the pulmonary embolism may also block vessels in other organs, such as the brain, cause a stroke.Of course it would be a theoretical issue if you had vein thrombosis, first that painful leg must be visited to determine whether there is a thrombosis or some other issue.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"my blood pressure is normally about 115/76 this morning i woke up vomiting and very weak. my blood pressure was 96/54. what would cause that. it went back to bed and slept until about an hour ago. it is going back up and is now at 110/58. i am a 58 year old female with tendancy to high colesterol but it is being controlled with niacin","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern.Judging from your description the drop in blood pressure occurred after vomiting.

Afterwards your cardiovascular system reacted by adapting the work of the heart and the tension in your blood vessels in order to bring blood pressure back to 110/58 which is close to your normal values. So for the moment I would advise only to stay hydrated.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"My bp is 123 over 91.  I know this probably shouldn't be of concern but also have bad headache.

The other alternative is surgery which is far more morbid . Also the she used during stenting is similar to what they used previously in CT. So do discuss it with your doctor , so he may take precautions before the procedure and preferably use alternative dye . Yes follow up MRI would be better in your case for Evaluation.

Constant monitoring of blood pressure is a must. Apart from this no major drug interactions present with other drugs. 2) No.You should NEVER stop anti hypertensive and antihyperlipidemic drugs just because you have normal readings now. You have normal values because of the medications. If you stop it, then blood pressure and lipid values will increase and can lead to dangerous consequences. 3) Hilin-GM (Diacerin + glucosamine) can be taken beyond 10-15 days. But after 3 months, the improvement in symptoms must be measured and then decision should be taken about continuing. Belosix (febuxostat) must be taken for long period time.

But it's usually associated with hypersensitivity reactions that includes symptoms like facial puffiness, difficulty in breathing and others.

As for the native arteries, they will progress in the natural atherosclerosis. keep a watch on them by keeping a regular touch with your cardiologist and angiography  when necessary. if they progress and develops symptoms like angina/breathlessness, then few medicines will have to be added. present technology also allow to do angioplasty in those arteries."},{"Patient":"Listen to my heart with my sethascope with beats going wish wash wish wash beep beep beep wish wash wish wash. I know their messed up which is weird. But when I take a deep breath and hold it I cant hear my heart beat at all. I can feel it on my neck.when I touch the main artery. But can t hear it with the sethascope. Its really weird","Doctor":"Thank you for the question.There is something called sinus arrhythmia that means normal variation of heart beats while breathing.Rate increases on inspiration and comes down on breathing out.This effect is more pronounced in children and young adults."},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor,I had hypertension of 160/115, then treated with Concor5 and BP comedown to 145/100 after two years course of medicine. Now the doctor perscribed AmolpresAT after complete blood, tyroid and abdonmal checkups. I need your suggestion. Thanks","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern.Concor5 (bisoprolol) is an appropriate medication to initiate high blood pressure treatment. The issue is that not all patients can be controlled with only one medication, often a combination of 2 or more drugs from different classes may be necessary, as having different mechanisms of action they are more effective together.In your case Concor seems indeed to not be enough, that 145/100 blood pressure reading is still high. So it seems reasonable from your doctor to add another antihypertensive drug. Amlopres (amlodipine) is another such drug also a very widely used one. So you should continue it and periodically monitor blood pressure to check whether further treatment changes are necessary.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"i took crestor for about 6 months- 10 mg- since going off of it i have had heart palpations usuallyat nite- went to emerg room on memorial day weekend- they admitted me for 2 days said it was ad -fib- i think it was the crestor...i now take pravastin but still have the heart skips at nite also am taking a beta blocker and blood thinner now because of the skips pooling blood and do not want a stroke from it? what do you think?","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern.Crestor is a lipid lowering drug, it doesn't act on the heart and has no effect on heart beats. So it was not the cause. If you have Afib (atrial fibrillation) then it certainly does explain the heart skips, it is a type of heart rhythm abnormality. The beta blocker aims to control the rate of the heart but still may feel some palpitations.As for the stroke prevention, you have every right to be concerned, Afib is one of the main causes of stroke. For that matter taking a blood thinner to prevent it is essential. As for comments on the choice of the blood thinner (there are different types) and the dosage it is hard to make any suggestion since you do not say which blood thinner have you started and the dosage. I would be happy to approve or make suggestions if you provide more information.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"My mother is on a beta blocker and says she is always tired. I have noticed (and I am a Nursing student) that she looks pale/pallor. Is this a side effect? Does she need less medication to perfuse her Cardio system? It seems as though her cells are not being oxygenated enough. What do you think? She is 5'6; 145 lbs; HTN (stage One); Hx of situational anxiety. Thank you!","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern.Beta blockers can at times excessively slow heart rate or lower blood pressure and lead to weakness and tiredness. However that is easily established by measuring blood pressure and checking her pulse and measure her pulse rate which can be easily done at home. If rate is over 60 beats per minute and blood pressure is not low then I do not think that the beta blocker is the cause.In that case other possibility should be looked at starting with anemia, liver and kidney conditions etc. For that some routine blood tests for blood count, glucose, liver and kidney function, electrolyte panel are advised.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"Hi ....I was diagnosed for MVP with very mild MR in 2005 (I went to see the doctor after experiencing a sharp pain in the right side of my chest) Since then I am in regular follow-up (annually). My doctor (Cardiologist) informed me it is a normal condition and 10 in 100 people will have this. I had few problem at the initial time of diagnosis such as palpitation, etc. My doctor suggested me to take atenol 25 mg quarter tablet each day along with ecosprin 75 mg. He informed me that in case if i experience any pain or discomfort, he asked me to visit him. Later, in 2010 I went to re-check again, I was advised to take ECG, Echocardiogram and xray. The report said all my test results are normal and no sign of MVP or MR. My doctor informed me I got well and no need to take medicines. Now in Dec 2011, for more than a week I again experience discomfort in the right side of my chest. I went to my doctor he checked my pulse and BP and referred me for ECG.

My age is 32, Height: 5.72 cms: Weight: 72kg","Doctor":"hi, Firstly, MVP that you may be having is very common as your cardiologist told you and need not worry if it's associated with mild MR. if you're having palpitations or mild pricking chest pain , then B blocker (atenolol) in low dose may help you without any side effects. Moreover the medicine you're on is in very low dose and if you can bear the symptoms then you may altogether stop them.Keep a regular check up with cardiologist yearly."},{"Patient":"I’m having a sharp squeezing like pain in my chest on the right side.

This pain in moving has nothing to do with the heart. If there is not a problem with your lungs, it may be just muscle pain and you may need to use anti-inflammatory like Ibuprofen for some days.

The cardiologist wants to add another lead to help the conduction. He is not in favor of stopping the drug. Should I be adamant about seeing where I am at without the drugs or pacemaker. It seems to me all these things are causing more problems","Doctor":"HI, AF has 2 major treatment- one is oral anticoagulant (which I hope you're taking as you've not mentioned) and second is rate control medicine. Pacemaker with cardiozem is for the second reason. you'll have to continue them for life time. I don't feel you should try yourself stopping them. Talk to your cardiologist or mail him as he may be able to explain you the need of all. Adding one more lead - I feel it may be due to AV synchrony and may help you.

I normally take 800 mg ibuprofen for the pain,  but was asked to discontinue it until after the surgery. Could this be a side effect of the pain and anxiety about the surgery?Also because of the size of my arms, I had to really work to get it in the cuff of the machine. Could this cause an inaccurate reading too?","Doctor":"Hey,BP of 142/69 mm Hg is slightly high, but a single reading of high bp is not that important. You can get hgh bp during exercise, anxiety or exertion. Inaccurate sized cuff also causes inaccuracy in bp measurement. Small sized cuff overestimates the bp (like in your case) & large sized cuff underestimates the bp. So do remember to measure your bp with a appropriate sized cuff (which covers 2/3rd of your arm circumference).thanksDr Sameer Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"my ventricular septum is extremly thin & flops around like a flag.

If you are a smoker, try to stop smoking for some days and gradually do try to totally quit it.You can till than use steam inhalation and anti allergic drugs like levocetrizine to decrease the irritative cough. Lisinopril is good for HTN.ThanksDr Sameer Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"I have been suffering from hypertension for over 10years and have been advised nebicard 10 and 150 ecosprin at night and covance D in the morning. was doing quite ok till about 5days ago when I had tooth extraction and had to be given quite a few local anesthetic jabs as it was a difficult extraction. am on augmentin 625 thrice a day and also combiflam twice a day. my BP shot up and was at 180/110 for a couple days and didnt come down ispite of my taking extra nebicard tabs. then my doc prescribed snumilo 5 which I have been on for last 3 days. now my BP stays at 140/90 most times but goes up to 160/100 when its nearing tab time. what do i do? a little worried. I am 55years old. thank you.","Doctor":"Hey,The rise in bp after any intervention including dental extraction is a normal body response to stress condition. Taking nebicard and snumlo must be enough for controlling the bp.The use of augmentin ( antibiotic) alongwith generally do not rise your bp. So yoy can safely use augmentin for the duration prescribed by your dentist.If the bp remains high i.e. >150/90 mm Hg, you can change nebicard to Nebicard - H in the morning which consist one additional drug for bp control. Rest dont worry the bp will get controlled. You also have to decrease the salt intake in diet for the optimal bp control.ThanksDr Sameer"},{"Patient":"I have been on blood pressure medicine for many years (Lisinopril 20 - HCTZ 25).

Yes as the treating  doctor said it's a good conection between  heart problems and peptic ulcer  especially in elders. I would exsplain why:In the patient with heart problem such valvule dissease  and coronary dissease ( bypass  ) the heart sometimes don't  pomp enough  blood in the body so the organs cells will suffer from the  lack of oxygen .One of these is the stomach . Normaly the stomach mucosa  keep in balance the acid in the stomach and protect against bacterial infection with some mechanism and one of them is the mucosal blood food .In this way the stomach mucosa ( the superficial part of the stomach ) will not allow the acid and bacteria (H.Pylori ) to penetrate deeper and to cause ulcer .In case of this patient the mucosal blood flow is low and will have peptic ulcer .The perforation and bleeding are complication of the peptic ulcer .Wish these help you to understand.

I work full time as a Medical Assistant and a manager at Burger King. During my recent pregnancy I was experiencing episodes of dizziness and passing out. So I had to stop driving. It was discovered that may have a congenital cardiac abnormality. Recently a Cardiac Specialist performed a TEE procedure. Here are the results ( as written in my medical chart) It was discovered I have a large 5mm-7mm Patent Foremen Ovale or small ASD equivalent PFO with bidirectional shunt (positive contrast study for R-L shunt and left to right shunt on color Doppler). Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size with normal LV systolic function. No regional wall motion abnormality. RV size and systolic function appear normal. Consider Device closure of PFO since patient has recurrent TIA-like symptoms or syncpal episodes. My cardiologist advises against the surgery even though he sent me to see a top cardiac surgeon for further work up and to confirm the diagnosis. The surgeon feels the surgery should be performed while I am still young to prevent complications in the future and because I have been symptomatic with episodes of TIA and Syncope. I am not sure whose advice to follow. Please share with me the risks and benefits of this surgery. I need your help and professional advice.","Doctor":"Hello, Many patients have pfo, and it may be found during a routine examination with cardiac ultrasound. Since you have had symptoms, especially in your pregnancy it may be considered to close these defect. Your heart looks in great form.

From the other hand, when taken regularly for a long time, it can lead to chronic changes in the blood vessels wall, causing progressive atherosclerosis.

However isolated measurements are not enough as blood pressure is affected by many factors like stress and pain. So treatment is not started for one single high value (since the measurements are only 10 min apart it is the same episode). What is advised is to measure blood pressure once or twice daily for the next 10 days. Measurements should be made after resting for at least 5 minutes and not after having taken coffee or alcohol in the preceding hour.

Myocardial ischemia is caused by coronary artery disease. Coronary arteries are the blood vessels of the heart muscle, if they are partially occluded cause ischemia, and if they are totally occluded cause infarction. Untreated ischemia leads to infarction. Nowadays, coronary artery disease, myocardial ischemia and infarction are more frequent in young adults (younger than 45) than before.The causes which may lead to ischemia are atheromatous coronary disease (hypertrigliceridemia, low HDL, with risk factors smoking, obesity and lack of physic activity), non-atheromatous coronary disease (congenital coronary anomalies, artery dissecation, heart valve infection), hypercoagulable states ( antiphospholipid syndrome, nephrotic syndrome etc), use of recreational drugs (cocaine, amphetamine, heavy use of alcohol). In young patients this condition develops painless, unlike the over 45 patients.

They would do this tomorrow, i am out of state and she is terrified would rather address problem with meds if poss. Any suggestions would be welcome.","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern. Probably my answer is coming a little late and the procedure has already been done, but I'm answering anyway so that perhaps others in the future in your situation may profit.I assume your mother has an atrioventricular block, a type of arrhythmia where impulses are not conducted to the heart ventricles. So there is the risk of there not being enough blood being pumped by the heart during these episodes which can be risky. It is not a question which can be handled with medication, not if is a persisting issue, the available medication can be used only temporarily. Only thing is if she has medication which may favor it they can be withheld but I suppose that has already been considered before by her doctors, it is something pretty basic.So I am afraid a pacemaker is the only alternative left. You shouldn't be too much worried as it is a basic procedure, a really routine one, with little risk involved.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"My mom has a heart infraction. She was also diagnosed with Big cell disease. She is only 56 and she cannot breath and get around. I asked her what her percentage was and she didn t know. What do I need to do to make her understand that this is serious?","Doctor":"Hello.If your mother indeed has heart or myocardial infarction (heart attack), it is extremely serious and she is very lucky to have survived it.She needs urgent treatment as she may not be so lucky next time. After the consultation her physician will ask fir a few blood tests and an ECG and Echocardiogram. She may also require a treadmill test if both the ECG and Echocardiogram donot show any obvious abnormalities. However, as you said, if she has had a heart attack, she will need intervention like angioplasty or possibly a bypass surgery depending on the severity of the blocks.She needs to understand the significance. This condition if ignored, can lead to death or may give rise to other heart conditions like irregular heart beat which may cause a stroke and leave her paralyzed for the rest of her life. Hope she understands the significance and agrees to a hospital visit.Wishing her good health.Regards,Dr Geeta"},{"Patient":"Hi I had my Blood pressure taken by the nurse yesturday and she commented it was very low, asked me if i get dizzy and i said no, but then coming away and thinking more i have recently been getting very anxious when at work and at home with the children ect, i have been and taken my BP today at the sergury and it was 106/59 should i see my doctor should i be concerned??

Thank you for using HCM I would say that your blood pressure is not to be concern for the moment.We say a patient has low blood pressure when it's under 90:60 , It is to be concern when you have symptoms of hypotension: Fainting , dizziness or lightheadedness, nause , blurred vision, cold skin, breathing problem , thirst. I would recommend  to drink planty of water , manage stress,  be aware of these symptoms ,  monitor your blood pressure how it changes from laying down to standing up ( if it changes more than 20 the systolic one and more than 10 the diastolic one ) , If you blood pressure changes after standing up for a long time , .call your local doctor if you see these changes .Wish you good healthIf you have any other questions please feel free to write me ."},{"Patient":"hello, I am 30 years old, 5 6 and about 208 lbs. Earlier tonight I was driving and smoking a cigarette. As soon as I started smoking the cigarette i felt a bit edgy kind of shakey . after a few minutes I felt an anxiety attack coming on. Ive had these before but not like today. My vision was very blurry, It was hard for me to focus on what was infront of me. My hands got cold and and started to tingle reallly bad like if they were numb. I began to sweat and had the feeling I was about to black out. I felt like I couldnt breath. could this have been a mini stroke and not a severe anxiety attack?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!Your symptoms seem to be related to pure anxiety or a panic attack. You should know that during panic attack can mimic a lot of symptoms that include the central nervous system disorder or a heart disorder. But, you have nothing to worry about. Besides, strokes (even when they are small) usually have a different symptomatology that lasts for at least some days. So, just relax and don't think about it. I recommend taking some alprazolam 0.5mg if these episodes occur again. Consulting with a psychiatrist can help you manage and prevent these episodes.

Anyway, if he feels symptoms like dizziness, fatigue and sweating, this could be a sign that his body does not tolerate these low levels of glucose. I would recommend reducing the dose of Glycomet GP in order to have higher levels of glucose. You should know that all oral antidiabetics can lead to hypoglycemia as a common adverse effect. That is why the dose should be adjusted based on the fasting glucose levels during the day. You should discuss with his endocrinologist about the above issues.

I felt very weak and had a major headache continued with vomiting. I was taken to a hospital right away. The doctor gave me anti nausea medicine and sent me straight away for a CT Scan. Luckily, nothing was found in my CT Scan Result. The doctor instructed me stay at the hospital. He also disallowed me to get out of bed. I was feeling very weak and I was resting the whole afternoon until I had to go to the bathroom. Then I fainted again in the bathroom. I finally spent 3 nights on bed at the hospital. At home, I rest for 3 days on bed after I finally tried working. At work, I'm experiencing difficulties to focus, dizziness, easily tired, and short breath. I finally put myself to rest on bed. I had my blood checked and I went to a doctor. He said I should not be worry because this is only temporary due to the shock that my head had. That was early last week, today I tried to do normal activities. I tried walking for 30 minutes, then I went out for approximately one hour to do some errands. I still feel tired, dizzy, and unable to focus. I am wondering what is wrong with me and how I can cure this. I am 27. 128 pounds. 5'4\\"I used to faint quite often when I was a child due to my low blood pressure. However, I've never experienced this before. Hopefully I can get an input that's helpful to me.","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on HCM!I carefully passed through your question and would explain that your symptoms could be related to low blood pressure or orthostatic hypotension. I recommend performing a Head Up Tilt test to exclude possible orthostatic hypotension as the possible cause of your symptoms. Other blood lab tests to consider would be: - complete blood count for anemia- thyroid hormone levels for possible dysfunction- cortisol plasma levels for possible adrenal gland dysfunction- blood electrolytes, for possible imbalance. - a cardiac ultrasound and an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring are necessary to examine your heart function and structure. If all the above tests result normal, I recommend consulting with a neurologist for an EEG, in order to exclude possible seizures.

You should know that all the drugs can potentially cause allergic reactions as an adverse effect. But, it is important excluding other possible causes that may lead to this symptomatology too. I would recommend consulting with your attending physician for a careful physical exam and some tests (complete blood count and inflammation tests for a possible infection). Meanwhile I would recommend stopping lisinopril intake and closely monitoring your blood pressure ( high blood pressure can occur from this change in your therapy).

As no possible cause of stroke was found, we can not confirm that it is safe for you to undergo such extreme sports. I recommend you to closely monitor your blood pressure, continue on a healthy lifestyle and perform periodically scheduled follow ups (which blood lipid profile, resting ECG and cardiac ultrasound, complete blood count, fasting glucose, etc.) every 6 months to check if everything is OK.

A cardiac arrhythmia can not be excluded either. I recommend performing further tests to investigate for the possible cause underlying your symptoms: - thyroid hormone levels for possible thyroid dysfunction- an urine analysis for infection- a chest X ray study- an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring to examine your hear rhythm trends during the day and exclude possible cardiac arrhythmia. - inflammation tests (PCR, sedimentation rate) for an inflammation or an infection. You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues.

I would give you some advise how we treat patient with high blood pressure :-first measure your blood pressure  3 times a day  to see for 1 week   how much is it and to be sure that you have a blood pressure - When the blood pressure is between 140-150 : 90-100  it stage 1 hypertension  I would advice to change your lifestyle : -Reduce salt in your diet , reduce fatty food , -Loose weight ( healthy weight ) ,  -Do exsercise every day ,- If you drink alcohol limit it  no smoking -Manage stress .  and monitor your blood pressure to see how it works otherwise you need to start a medication (like enalaprill ).-When the blood pressure is higher then a 150: 100 you need treatment anyway .After you monitor you blood pressure for 1 week to know the result , if you really have high blood pressure , I would advise you to go to your local doctor to do some examination ;blood test ( cholesterol) , check you heart , kidneys and others ,to confirm   wich is the cause of high blood pressure and if you need other treatment like for high level of cholesterol ,..Hope these work Wish you good health ."},{"Patient":"Hi my mom was found unconscious in her chair at 10 am today.

You should know that in the brain it is not a matter of dimensions. There are certain areas of the brain, which can cause severe consequences even in millimeters of damage.

I am told that I have left vestibular hypertension, is this connected to my blood pressure. I am tired all the time and vitamin d level was 6.9 and just before I start my period I suffer fom dizziness, lightheadedness and nausea.","Doctor":"Hello dear, Thank you for your question. I have carefully read your situation. Your previous history of relatively \\"low\\" blood pressure seems to exclude hypotension as a cause of dizziness. Another important cause of dizziness are the vestibular disorders. The dizziness and lightheadedness that attenuate before your periods,  can be explained by the increased sensitivity of your body because of the hormonal changes. Hormones involved in the menstrual cycle tend to produce a retention effect of water and salt, which contributes to increased vestibular pressure and the subsequent symptoms. I usually advise my patients to avoid caffeine, cigarettes, a moderate intake of liquids, a diet restricted in sodium. If you feel that your problem is geting worse you might need to consult an ENT specialist to reevaluate your vestibular disorder. I hope this helped. If you have any other question, do not hesitate to contact the HCM website.Kind regards,Dr. Alma"},{"Patient":"My 10 year old has had blood in his nose the last two days.

I do have high high BP family history, but mine is excellent.  Also have family history of diabetes.","Doctor":"HelloWelcome to Healthcare Magic.I can certainly understand your concerns and have worked through your query in detail.Left ventricular hypertrophy is primarily due to elevated blood pressure over a long period of time.This will mainly cause increased external workload on the heart against which it has to pump blood to meet the body demands.This over a period of time will cause the heart muscle to increase in  muscle  thickness leading to ventricular hypertrophy.This can serve as a risk factor for heart disease particularly ischemic heart disease like Myocardial infarction.Hence, it is important to keep the blood pressure under control to prevent such events.I advise you to take anti hypertension medication that can reverse this ventricular hypertrophy and eliminate the risk for heart disease.Drugs like Ace inhibitors ( Losartan) will be helpful in this regard.A periodic echo and ecg of the heart will also be helpful in monitoring the reversibility of ventricular hypertrophy.Diet low in sodium content is equally important.Please check with your Cardiologist if he shares my view and if can prescribe these pills and investigations to you.Post your further queries if any.Thank you."},{"Patient":"i am 38 years old, weight is 74 kgs and height is 5.9 and there is no previous medical history.

A doctor considers many things like age , diabetes status, highest and lowest readings of blood pressure, and race etc to select the best blood pressure medication for you.My advice for you is:1) First of all change your life style.2) Use less salt and fat. 3) Stay physically active.4) Avoid Coffee caffeine, smoking (what ever is relevant).5) Lose 10kg weight to be in good range6) Monitor your blood pressure regularly if it stays consistently above 150/90 for a week instead of all the life style modifications ,and medications, do visit your doctor with that record to get the medication adjusted. You can use ditide for long time but it's advised to discuss it with your cardiologist first.I hope this answered your question, If you have more queries I am happy to answer you.Regards.Dr.Muhammad Ahmad"},{"Patient":"hi my blood pressure is 154 over 94 for the past 4 days i have had some pain shooting in my chest my right arm is tingling slight headaches at one stage my head felt like it had exploaded and i have a funny feeling on the left hand side of my face its not numb its just a different felling than my right side is this any thing to worry about i do suffer from sleep aponea thank you for your time sorry my age is 53 i am 5'7 and my weight is 9st 5lbs","Doctor":"Hello , The symptoms you describe can be because of hypertension itself particularly if the rise in blood pressure is recent onset .

But the medicines you are on sometimes cause a postural drop in blood pressure, which means that the blood pressure instead of rising (as it does on standing) falls causing the patient to feel dizzy and sometimes pass out.Dehydration also causes the same.If there is a history of heart problems in the past, any episodic disturbance in heart rhythm can also cause one to pass outFor this I would advise you to get your postural Blood pressure checked, take Lisinopril at night and get an EKG (preferably 24 hours Holter) done to look into the causeI hope this answered your question, if you have more feel free to ask.Regards.Dr.Asad Riaz.General and Family Physician."},{"Patient":"i consistently get higher BP readings (150/100) at the doctor's office; but when i check at home using digital blood pressure monitor (115/75), it is really low. my doctor says it could be due to white coat hypertension, but can the readings fluctuate that much?","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for writing to Health Care magic, I am Dr , Muhammad Ahmad , I have read your question closely, I understand your concern and will be helping you with your health related problem.Yes in my opinion too this is due to white coat hypertension. Yes the readings can fluctuate this much. White coat hyper tension is actually caused by anxiety of being in a doctor's clinic and fearing about what comes next and how dangerous a condition you might be having.This anxiety makes a person to get adrenaline rushes, and activates sympathetic system's fight and flight responses, this makes the blood pressure to rise and heart rate to get more, some people may get very little response to white coat anxiety and some get  very significant response just like your do get.I would suggest you to keep checking your blood pressure regularly at home if that stays well within limit then you shouldn't be worried at all and consider it a normal white coat hyper tension which doesn't need any special treatment.I hope this answered your question, If you have more queries I am happy to answer you.Regards.Dr.Muhammad Ahmad"},{"Patient":"I had a pacemaker 3 months ago.

His only option at this stage is to get his blood pressure down and stable and allow it to heal itself and at a later time when he is stronger, insert a stent? Is this possible?","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for writing to Health Care magic, I am Dr , Muhammad Ahmad , I have read your question closely, I understand your concern and will be helping you with your health related problem.The best option of treatment for an aortic tear , we call aortic dissection is to get a surgery done and remove that part of aorta which has a tear. Along with that is is very very important to control his blood pressure to a maximum of 130 systolic , even below that. Because blood pressure can cause tear to proceed further and cause more problems, even after surgery a high blood pressure causes risk of creating a new tear in the intima of aorta.If religious stand point does not allow surgery then there are very limited reliable options available , stenting has been tried but result have been controversial. Most cardiovascular interventionists prefer surgery , stents have their own problems and they are usually ok for aortic narrowing but in a widened torn aorta they usually don't settle well and don't show good long term results.In this case scenario I would suggest that the patient should keep strict control over his blood pressure and can talk to a vascular surgeon who can do minimally invasive procedure, in this way a surgery with very little blood shed will be possible , here i want to mention that even stenting will cause some blood shed so for the sake of saving life this much will have to be discussed. In a nut shell, surgical repair is the best option , if the surgeon can do it with minimally invasive technique it will need much less blood loss.

Arteries are high pressure flow regions. Add to it the fact that they give blood thinner during the procedure which delays clotting of blood at the site where the prick was made. Due to this some blood from that high pressure area escapes from the artery and collects under the skin immediately after tge procedure or during removal of arterial sheathThat blood is then broken down by the body to give a purplish color.It is not permanent and will disappear in due time.

If you are able to climb a flight of stairs without becoming short of breath at all, your heart should, theoretically, be healthy enough for sex. Of course, if you feel any shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or palpitations, you should stop and seek medical attention."},{"Patient":"my age is 40 and i am 5ft 10 inches tall male i am having medicine for blood pressure since one years i.e.concor 2.5 mg i am not having errection since  one month .my blood pressure is also varying sometimes it is on low side for eg.120/70 sometime it is on higher side for e.g.140/90.when my b.p.is low i also have pulpation.Please advice i am very much worried","Doctor":"Concor is a beta blocker, which is a very good medication for controlling blood pressure. One of the common side effects from beta blockers is erectile dysfunction; I would discuss this with your physician to see if you might be able to switch to another blood pressure control medication. Additionally, if you are having palpitations when your blood pressure is lower, that could mean you are not well hydrated. Please be sure to drink at least 2 liters of water per day, more if you are active/sweating."},{"Patient":"Hi, im ana.

If your thyroid hormone is abnormal, for example, this could explain your symptoms. Another possible explanation is dehydration, so be sure to drink enough water (at least 64 ounces, or 2 L, per day). Another common reason for these could be pregnancy.

I will be highly greatful. I am very worried abt him.please answer soon. i am online.thanks. AGE:60 Weight 66","Doctor":"Metpure is metoprolol, a beta blocker medication which slows down the heart and helps to control blood pressure. If your father is having palpitations, he should definitely have an ECG (electrocardiogram) to be sure there isn't an irregular heart rhythm. Ideally, the ECG should be done while he is experiencing the palpitations, but they could also do a 24-hour ECG called a Holter monitor to identify the palpitations. In the meantime, metoprolol (Metpure) is the appropriate medication for his symptoms, as long as his blood pressure is good."},{"Patient":"I am 41years old my angioplasy was done on 24th April,2008, I take Tab.Ascard 75mg & Atarva 20mg I am feeling well my B.P usuall 80/120.

You should also do a stress test every 2 years just to see everything is fine. The complications post Angioplasty is mainly because of blood thinner which can cause bleeding from any part of the body but these are essential post Angioplasty so any incidence of significant bleeding should be reported.

First of all you need a baseline ECG and 2D Echo. ECG should preferably be taken at time of palpitations. If the ECG does not reveal any abnormality than you need a 24 hr ECG monitoring which is called Holter Monitoring. Arrhythmias in a patient with heart murmer is very common.So i strongly recommend you for these tests.Dr Sameer"},{"Patient":"i am 63 years old man.  about a month back i had pain in chest and felt heaviness.

I'm afraid that such a high dose would drop my heart rate down too low.thank you.","Doctor":"Coreg CR ( carvedilol) was prescribed at 80mg because of your high blood pressure on presentation in emergency. Stopping of the earlier medication lotrel(amlodipine+benazepril) abruptly has resulted in such a high blood pressure. Never stop hypertensive medications abruptly. It can shoot up the blood pressure and cause dangerous consequences. Now you have concern regarding high dose, you need to take these two points in consideration while thinking of 80mg as a high dose -Lotrel that was used for control earlier is a fixed dose combination of two drugs - you had two different drugs controlling your blood pressure -Your blood pressure shot upto 170/122 which certainly warrants the use of such high dosagesNow I would suggest you to undergo regular blood pressure check ups and if your blood pressure or heart rate is going below normal, then definitely there can be a reduction in dose."},{"Patient":"i have chest pain in the middle of my chest, with numbness in my right arm and sometimes my right leg.

Thank you,","Doctor":"Hi, Anxiety can cause an increase in heart rate and palpitations which is a normal phenomenon. The heart rate becomes normal as soon as the stimulus goes away. The exact diagnosis of the palpitation depends on the time of the ECG if the ECG is taken at the time of palpitations then a proper diagnosis can be made. But as the palpitations are short-lived, we generally advise for a 24hr continuous ECG monitoring of the heart which is called Holter monitoring. You don't need any medication for now but further management will depend on the Holter report. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

There is nothing to worry about if this problem doesn't get repeating itself.Heart burn is not usually related to heart problem , Your problem seems to be caused by Stomach/gut upset, it needs life style modification before any medication , here is what you need to do.1) Avoid coffee, caffeine, Fizzy drinks , junk food, smoking, alcohol (What ever is relevant).2) Take small multiple meals instead of few larger ones.3) Drink much fluids.4) Use fruits and vegetables more than meat.5) Use fiber diet like fruits vegetables whole grain bread and fiber supplements if needed.6) Stay physically active.7) If you are over weight reduce it.8) After trying out all these measure you can use syrup gaviscon thrice a day this will keep a check at your gut PH.9)  I also recommend similar patients  to use Omeprazole 40mg once a day to check stomach acid levels.I hope this answered your question, If you have more queries I am happy to answer you.Regards.Dr.Muhammad Ahmad"},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, Last more then 10 years , i am taking BP medicine Amlopin AT ( USV Ltd) and also i  am taking thayroid medicine       , now last two to three year , my wait is incress and also feeling Fatigue and also seen some time Swelling on my legs so please suggest ..

Take a diary and start writing his blood pressures three times a day with dates and then take this record to his doctor.In this age there can be a number of causes of blood pressure rise , renal artery stenosis can be one of them hormonal issues can cause it too but first best step to do is making a blood pressure chart. Till tour next visit to doctor reduce salt intake of your son , only if BP is consistently on a higher side.If BP stays on a higher side on checking the record , your doctor might run some more tests on him like catecholamin levels, renal artery doppler, ultra sound abdomen , MRi brain , what ever he deems necessary, to rule out different causes of early onset hypertension.I hope this answered your question, If you have more queries I am happy to answer you.Regards.Dr.Muhammad Ahmad"},{"Patient":"My bp was 154  over 63 with a pulse of 71    What does that indicate I am a 68, female and recently diag. with a  severe focal stenosis of the proximal left internal carotid  artery.

It came up when it was noticed that people having normal blood pressure when visit hospital for checkup, tend to have higher BP this is probably because of the anxiety and concern about one's condition and what happens next. If you had higher blood pressure in the hospital but usually your blood pressure stays fine it is very much possible that you had white coat hypertension. There is a simple thing to check it which you can do at home. Just get a Blood pressure apparatus and start checking your blood pressure twice a day if it stays below 150/90 then well and good there is nothing to worry but if it stays consistently high then there this probably wasn't white coat hypertension. And you will have to make at least a 5 days BP reading record on a paper and visit your doctor to get your medication adjusted.

Brain can only survive about 8-10 minutes  without oxygen , 20 minutes was too much for it's capacity.In my opinion unfortunately her signs show brain death and she according to medical science has no chances to recover, last and final test which is done is EEG to see brain activity if even that is negative then it is advised to get the patient off ventilator and let her go in dignity.

All patients having  a metallic heart valve in place are almost always getting an anticoagulant(blood thinner) which is in most cases Warfarin. This might thin out your blood that that extent that it starts oozing out of minor ulcers or damaged mucosa places of patient's stomach and gut. This is probably the case with your mother, She is 88 so not making blood as efficiently as a young person and on the other hand she is losing blood most probably through her gut because of blood thinners.I would advise you to discuss this problem of blood thinners with your doctor, after getting special monitoring tests like INR to see the extent to which blood has got thinned, the doctor can change the dose of warfarin and this can help with blood oozing eventually helping with the symptoms of your mother.I hope this answered your question, If you have more queries I am happy to answer you.Regards.Dr.Muhammad Ahmad"},{"Patient":"i have kidney disease and anyurisms in my kidney and lately everytime i smoke pot my heart beats so fast and my back starts to hurt and my head feels like theres pressure im scared i never used to feel like that before and im wondering if i should stop","Doctor":"Hello, I would explain that your symptoms could be related to high blood pressure or anxiety, probably caused by cannabis adverse effects.

Indeed it's only cure is surgery can't be treated with medication and can get dangerous for life if left untreated.It involves opening the chest by vascular surgeon and repairing the torn part of the vessel ..usually the torn part is resected and then the normal ends of the remaining artery are joined together, if a big stump of artery has to be taken out then putting some vessel at it's place is considered but this is very rarely done.It's a major surgery which can lead to any outcome but usually doctors weigh benefits over risks.. and in case of a bad dissection.. benefits are always more in getting the surgery done. If done well, patient usually ends up getting saved.

When a device is placed under skin it does cause local pressure effects and inflammation.As drainage of arm is passing through pectoral region so local pressure effects and inflammation may press on drainage system and causes swelling, local inflammation itself causes swelling, this is quite common in the earlier days after placement of the device.But this usually settles in 15 days , if this doesn't get better in 15 days , I would advise you to contact your doctor to look for the reason of swelling and proceed further for its workup and treatment. If it starts regressing then well and good let it take natural course.I hope this answered your question, If you have more queries I am happy to answer you.Regards.Dr.Muhammad Ahmad"},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor, I am 54 years old male.

Monitor your blood pressure regularly if it stays consistently above 150/90 for a week instead of all the life style modifications , do visit your doctor with that record to get the medication adjusted.Life style modifications will get your BP below 140/90 and you wont need any new medication , you can discuss this BP with your doctor in next visit but there is no emergency situation with this reading.I hope this answered your question, If you have more queries I am happy to answer you.Regards.Dr.Muhammad Ahmad"},{"Patient":"ascending aorta,  I was diagnosed with enlarged aorta. its dilated at 4cm. should I consider surgery now or wait to see if it gets bigger in 6 months time!

Yes heart issues can cause fatigue but it CAN NOT cause change in vision, as we have already ruled out heart issues so this fatigue and change of vision is because of something else.After a transplant the patient does take high potency immune suppressant  medication which keeps you protected from heart damage , these immune suppressants have multiple side effects fatigue and damage to eyes is very common among them, you are probably suffering from those side effects.I would advise you not to panic about the heart issues but visit your doctor to discuss about possible causes of fatigue and eye site problems other than the heart.

Risk factors for hypertension include lack of physical activity, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, family history, smoking and others. And you cannot attribute any sudden change in life style to hypertension. It's a chronic disease and it will develop over a period of time before it becomes apparent. In your case, your body mass index(BMI) is around 34 and by definition more than 30 means obesity (mild). Ideally BMI should be less than 25. Now 170/110 is pretty high blood pressure. You must treat it with medications and the aim is to bring it below 140/100 up to 120/80. Do NOT stop the medications prescribed to you. Please continue the medications with regular BP check up. If it's not going down, we can increase the dose or add another drug for control. Apart from medications, you must also make lifestyle changes. Physical activity has to be increased and aim for BMI below 25 ideally or at least below 30. Follow strict diet and reduce the salt content in food.

The solution to it is simple check your blood pressure when you feel dizzy and best way is to check is when you are sitting and then check it when you are standing if standing blood pressure is lower than sitting by 20 units then this is the problem.If you find this then contact your doctor. He will probably lower your drug dose in this case and you will get fine. If blood pressure is fine then you can try taking the medication at night so that blood pressure lowering happens when you are usually in bed this will go away till you get up in morning that usually helps patients in my clinic to counter postural drop symptoms due to Blood pressure meds.I hope this answered your question, If you have more queries I am happy to answer you.Regards.Dr.Muhammad Ahmad"},{"Patient":"I have had heart palpitations all day...they have stopped now and my blood pressure is 92/77...is this a normal blood pressure reading?...I'm a 35 year old female, 5'9, 150 lbs...have had an echocardiogram with trace mitro-valve and tricuspid prolapse, with a mildly dialated inferior vena cava","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!I carefully passed through your question and would explain that your blood pressure values are below the normal ranges, indicating low blood pressure.

Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Lyıng on the belly means that you are pressing against the abdominal wall. There is the aorta which takes the pressure of your weight pressing against the abdomen. It is a common law of physics that everything pumping against a blockage or resistence, should pump harder, in order to overcome that resistence. This is the same thing that happens in the human body. The heart pumps into the arteries, and the bigger the artery that has the resistence, the harder should heart pump against it, to keep proper supply of oxygen and nutrients distal to the resistence. If this is a worrisome event to you, then I suggest not to assume the lying on the belly position. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Take care.

He had a heart attack 2 years ago with the placement of a stent. the doctor said that his arteries are clear but that the stress test showed that his heart was a little tight what does that mean","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for writing to Health Care magic, I am Dr , Muhammad Ahmad , I have read your question closely, I understand your concern and will be helping you with your health related problem.This word \\"tight\\" is not a scientific term as such but doctors in general use it after stress testing when there is an artery which has some blockage , usually this blockage is not significant to ask for a stenting but it is significant to cause some ECG changes in the stress testing.You and your husband do not have to panic, these kind of arteries just need care, by care i mean taking regular medication , physical activity, keeping check at your diet and  staying in contact with doctor and pay regular follow up visits as advised by the doctor.This slight tightness will only get worse if care is not taken otherwise it will regress and things will keep getting better with time.I hope this answered your question, If you have more queries I am happy to answer you.Regards.Dr.Muhammad Ahmad"},{"Patient":"My wife who is 54 had a moderate heart attack - 100 per cent blockage in the lower right of her heart. Heart attack happened 48 hours after having breast surgery for cancer. How will chemo affect the decision for the breast cancer after having the stint place in her. She is HER2 +3 and neg. on both hormones receptors.","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for writing to Health Care magic, I am Dr , Muhammad Ahmad , I have read your question closely, I understand your concern and will be helping you with your health related problem.Right artery usually causes less dangers as compared to the left one and if stent has been placed then most probably your wife is safe as far as cardiology point of view is concerned. Regarding chemotherapy, there are certain drugs which are more cardiotoxic and they can affect the heart negatively specially immediately after a heart attack but usually they can be continued after heart has recovered (usually in 6-8 weeks of heart attack) , other safe chemo therapy drugs can be started earlier.In my opinion you wife will be able to take her chemo without any problems doctor will just keep monitoring her heart which is usually done with the help of echocardiography , and if that stays fine , she will be able to complete the course without any problems. In a nut shell i would say that moderate cardiac even doesn't affect decision of chemo in a patient.

It is a disease only associated with pregnancy. It can happen anytime after 20 weeks and up to four weeks after delivery. You usually get severe fluid retention and congestive heart failure symptoms. It can be life-threatening. If you had it once, you are four times more likely to get it again. I  would let your doctor know when you get pregnant about your two previous episodes.

It is not obviously not as good as 120/80.  I would  recommend returning to your prescribing physicians office  to discuss options with him. I would also make a log of your blood pressure's over the month in the meantime. You are on two very good blood-pressure medications sorry it is unusual that your blood pressure continues to be elevated. You may need to get some routine screening bloodwork to make sure there is no underlying disease causing your blood pressure to be up. You may also want to try to restrict yourself intake.

The pinching sensation you're feeling could be from a number of different things such as esophageal spasm, lung irritation, acid reflux, musculoskeletal pain, or heart condition. Regardless, I would recommend having your heart checked out again. It sounds like you might need an EKG and or a stress test. You could be having arrhythmias which is causing your heart to beat fast and abnormal.  The racing heart could be giving you the pinching sensation."},{"Patient":"Hello, I have a history of tachycardia and ectopic beats.

I was unable to stand and was very short of breath during the episode. This was obviously triggered by the cold water and now I am afraid of going into the pool and wondering if I should get this checked?","Doctor":"Chest pain and shortness of breath together with sweating very classical symptoms for abnormal heart conditions.  it sounds like when you jumped into the pool, your body went through a lot of stress due to the cold water. Therefore, it sounds like you might need a stress test in which they put your body through stress while monitoring your heart. This is one of the best tests for ischemic heart disease.

In the meantime you should make a log of your blood pressure off the medication. You should also have routine screening bloodwork to make sure your kidneys, liver, and electrolytes are well-balanced. Antihypertensives are usually lifelong medication and less you can control your blood pressure with diet  and exercise.

Anything from musculoskeletal, ribs ribs, lungs, esophageal, and everything in betweencan cause chest pain.  at your age it is very unlikely that your chest pain is related to your heart. It is more likely related to musculoskeletal pain such as a sore muscle.  heart pain also does not last for more than a couple minutes.

He used the artery from his arm for the bypass instead of the leg where the vein is usually taken and used for a bypass surgery. The bypass colapsed in the back of the heart where one of the bypasses was done, the other bypass was an artery connected at  the front from his lung.

Heart attacks are caused by ischemia to the heart muscle. The goal is to prevent the ischemia to the heart muscle. You need to optimize your medical treatment now before the ischemia becomes worse. He should take aspirin daily and all of the medications that have been prescribed by the cardiologist and or cardiovascular surgeon.  he should also exercise daily and eat a diet that is high and fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and omega fatty acids.

I would not be worried. You are at risk, however, for diabetic kidney disease. One of the best ways to protect your kidneys is with a low-dose medication called the lisinopril. Lisinopril is a medication that has been shown to protect the kidneys against diabetes and high blood pressure. It is a antihypertensive medication. Another way to protect the kidneys would be to control your blood pressure. Yoi should also try to control your diet and diabetes very well. Ultimately,  diabetes and high blood pressure are the leading causes of kidney disease and therefor you should try to control both optimally."},{"Patient":"Hi, I believe I have pericarditis due to cat scan and primary said so but cardiologist did noyt say for sure what it was but did no firther tests to determine.

I am tired of this.","Doctor":"Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium with occasional pericardial effusion. about 90% of the causes are unknown. Most people will have viral type symptoms such as fever, myalgias, and malaise. Pericarditis can also cause cute, sharp, stabbing chest pain that can last hours to days. Some people will also get shortness of breath and pain with breathing.I am assuming you had a pretty extensive work up before being diagnosed with pericarditis. The work up should've included blood work with inflammatory markers and cardiac markers, as well as EKG changes. The first line treatment is usually ibuprofen several times daily for about two weeks. There are other anti-inflammatories that work just as good if you cannot tolerate ibuprofen. Steroids are actually a second line treatment but work just as good as ibuprofen. Generally, about 7 to 10 days of ibuprofen can significantly decrease your symptoms and pericarditis. You should also get plenty of rest.  some people have will have recurrent pericarditis. You should also have an ultrasound of your heart to make sure there is no fluid around the heart. If you do not get better with ibuprofen in 10 days, I would recommend having a further work up to make sure you do not have my own pericarditis which involves the heart muscle."},{"Patient":"I m a 32 year old caucasian male.

For any patient having recurrent such attacks, there may be an ectopic focus in her heart. This means that a small part of heart heart muscle may be more excitable than normal and may during those episodes produce impulses that lead to rapid heart rate.The only permenant treatment for that is ablation of that ectopic focus by using radiofrequency ablation-a procedure that is done at an electrophysiology lab and uses radiation to destroy that small areaI hope this answered your question, if you have more feel free to ask.Regards.Dr.Asad Riaz.General and Family Physician.."},{"Patient":"iam a heart patient having MI 2 years back.

Avoid marketed products with added salt.Avoid fatty mealsThis way you can reduce and sometimes even totally eliminate your requirement for drugs to control your blood pressureFollow with your doctor on a monthly basis. Maintain a home based blood pressure record. And donot change any drug doses without consulting with your physicianI hope this answered your question, if you have more feel free to ask.Regards.Dr.Asad Riaz.General and Family Physician.."},{"Patient":"My mother's blood pressure was 141/66 she also has a bad headache. She on high blood pressure medication. My mother is fasting for Ramadan and will not drink or eat for 18 hours consecutivelly. She is 65 years old. What is your advise about her condition?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing to Health Care Magic, I am Dr Asad Riaz, I have closely read your question and I understand your concerns, I will hereby guide you regarding your health related problem.Fasting is not going to be detrimental to her health but if she overeats salty and fatty foods after breaking the fast, as is the norm in most social setups, her blood pressure controls are expected to deteriorate.So she may fast without any additional risk to her health but should ensure that she takes her meds daily and doesnt eat unhealthyI hope this answered your question, if you have more feel free to ask.Regards.Dr.Asad Riaz.General and Family Physician.."},{"Patient":"My mother is 76 years old, and was recently hopitalized with congestive heart failure. In the past she has had 1 heart attack which resulted in a triple bypass, then a stroke, then another mild heart attack, could all of this be detromental to her health?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing to Health Care Magic, I am Dr Asad Riaz, I have closely read your question and I understand your concerns, I will hereby guide you regarding your health related problem.What your mother had was coronary artery disease which means blockage of arteries that supply blood to heart muscle. This led to her heart attack which damaged a portion of heart muscle leaving it unable to function. The pumping ability of heart was this reduced which led to lesser blood enteringthe heart being ejected out into the system. This leads to back pooling of this blood into lungs which is the main featuee of a congestive heart failure. A stroke is a similar blockage in arteries but it happens in those supplying the brain leading to damage to a part of brainAs for your question, both heart failure and stroke affect the quality of life significantly. She has to be on meds lifelong, will require restriction of salt, a restriction of water intake beyond 1.5 litres a day and may need to be hospitalized for destabilization of her condition if her body comes under any kind of physical stress or illness.You need to follow with her cardiologist and make sure she follows the advice to the letter so that she may live a healthier life without any further complicationsAlso if she is diabetic-it is extremely imparative to have a good control of her sugarsI hope this answered your question, if you have more feel free to ask.Regards.Dr.Asad Riaz.General and Family Physician.."},{"Patient":"I've taken Lisinopril at 10mg for several weeks with little impact on my blood pressure so my doctor increased the dosage to 20mg.

I know that I am \\"allergic\\" to dust but this is quite pronounced, including \\"smelling dust,\\" runny nose as well as a tickling in my throat (and I know that this alone can be a side effect of Lisinopril).  My question is whether Lisinopril can increase the sensitivity to dust and therefore explain my symptoms?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing to Health Care Magic, I am Dr Asad Riaz, I have closely read your question and I understand your concerns, I will hereby guide you regarding your health related problem.Lisinopril is a drug, which other than targetting thr chemicals that affect your blood pressure, also reduces the rate of breakdown of bradykinin. This chemical is involved is several manifestations of the allergic response like cough, itch and rash. So yes, in some indviduals (less than 10%) it may cause symptoms like those you reported.It would be advisable if you contact your doctor to change your medicines and switch you to Losartan or Valsartan instead.I hope this answered your question, if you have more feel free to ask.Regards.Dr.Asad Riaz.General and Family Physician.."},{"Patient":"hi.....I'm a 43 year old male thats 290 lbs and I just had my bp checked and it was 186/83......

This could be related to overweight or straining physical activity. Nevertheless, I would recommend consulting with your attending physician for a physical exam and some tests to investigate for other possible secondary causes of high blood pressure: - a resting ECG- a chest X ray study- some blood lab tests (complete blood count, blood lipid profile, fasting glucose, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes, PCR, sedimentation rate)- an urine analysisIf all the above tests result normal, you should discuss with your doctor on the possibility of starting anti-hypertensive therapy, in order to have a better control of high blood pressure. I would also recommend some tips to help you maintain a normal blood pressure: - diet modifications (reduce salt and caffeine intake, avoid energetic drinks or pre-workout supplements)- avoid straining physical activity- try to reduce your weight (a dietitian may help you in this regard).

In such case coronary angiogram would be the golden standard test to examine the blood flow in the coronary arteries and also possibly treat coronary artery disease (with stent implantation). Anyway, if your friend does not want to take the risks of this miniinvasive procedure, he can perform a nuclear stress test or coronary angio CT scan, which are not as exact as coronary angiogram, but are less invasive. But, you should know that if these tests result abnormal, the next step would be coronary angiogram.

Usually heart attack presents with severe anterior chest pain that may spread in the surrounding areas. This type of pain usually doesn't go away. So it is safe to say that you have a very low probability of having had a heart attack. The fast heart rate or the feeling of having irregular rrythm may come from different conditions like: thyroid gland disorders, excessive caffeine consumption, smoking or even just stress. Rapid heart rate is also an important symptom of anxiety disorders.

If it gets any higher then you are a candidate for cholesterol lowering drugs. Statins for cholesterol have side effects (that I have experienced first hand) and are pushed by the drug industry and over the years doctors have fallen in line in prescribing them. My level was about 99 to 101 when I was put on them. I have quit taking them. I had the memory loss, muscle aches and blurry vision that are their side effects. Is the medical community being made aware of this or is there another scam going on. It bothers me that doctors would listern to pharmaceutical companies rather than remember their own learnings and experiences.","Doctor":"Well,the statin debate is a very controversial one. But the opposers are also quite extreme. I hope there will be a middle ground in the future about the levels. Above 300 cholesterol levels looks dangerous for any of my patients but yeah bringing it down to some guideline recommendation of below 70/100 in some patients increases the risk of side effects. The most notable side effect is myalgia and other muscle symptoms. Rarely serious rhabdomyolysis can also occur. Other side effects include neuropathy,new onset diabetes mellitus(again controversial) and others.I believe it's all about trade offs between higher cholesterol levels leading to increased cardiovascular risk versus statins side effects. A recent article in lancet also echoes the same view. The article is titled “interpretation of the evidence for the efficacy and safety of statin therapy” and here is the gist  -This Review is intended to help clinicians, patients, and the public make informed decisions about statin therapy for the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. It explains how the evidence that is available from randomised controlled trials yields reliable information about both the efficacy and safety of statin therapy. In addition, it discusses how claims that statins commonly cause adverse effects reflect a failure to recognise the limitations of other sources of evidence about the effects of treatment. Large-scale evidence from randomised trials shows that statin therapy reduces the risk of major vascular events (ie, coronary deaths or myocardial infarctions, strokes, and coronary revascularisation procedures) by about one-quarter for each mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol during each year (after the first) that it continues to be taken. The absolute benefits of statin therapy depend on an individual's absolute risk of occlusive vascular events and the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol that is achieved."},{"Patient":"My mother was 90 years  old .

Heart palpitations can be triggered by stress, exercise, medication or, rarely, a medical condition. Although heart palpitations can be worrisome, they're usually harmless. In rare cases, heart palpitations can be a symptom of a more serious heart condition, such as an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), that may require treatment. Palpitations that are infrequent and last only a few seconds usually don't require evaluation. If you have a history of heart disease and have frequent palpitations or have palpitations that worsen, then you will need a repeat work up with long-term heart-monitoring tests to see if your palpitations are caused by a more serious heart problem.Seek emergency medical attention if heart palpitations are accompanied by: Chest discomfort or pain, Fainting, Severe shortness of breath, Severe dizziness.

It is due to stress or anxiety as your doctor said . You should know that the normal heart may experience an extrasystole , so don't worry , it will go away with the stress . But you should do ECG just for routine examination .I hope that is satisfy to you , welcoming any question from youDr. Mario Aiad"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor,  i had hight blood pressure with daily dose of hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily.

They still have to use medication after that although things get better for them to some extent.Now in case of your mother there are three blocked arteries and there can not be enough collaterals formed which can compensate for three large arteries , and three lasrge arteries are not going to get cured with medication either so in my opinion you should not take risk over you mother's health thinking about a therapy which is just under trial and not an established treatment modality.Blockage of three arteries would need a surgery it can't even be treated safely with a stent so inmy opinion you should consider a surgery as early as possible instead of considering a treatment which is not sure to help your mother I hope this answered your question, If you have more queries I am happy to answer you.Regards.Dr.Muhammad Ahmad"},{"Patient":"My wifes blood pressure is running about 116/53 she is 63 and complainsm about dizziness and being tired all tihe time.

On resting first thing in the morning it I have felt it at 50 but never any lower than that. Early this week I felt sick and dizzy - I measured my h/r and it was 43. It went down to 39 but sat around 40-45 for a few hours and then came back to 60ish and the other sypmtoms disappeared. The same symptoms occured 2 days later while in the shower and again my h/r was 45. 2 days later again and I went to the bathroom. I felt dizzy while on the toilet (first thing in the AM). I went to get off and collapsed. My husband found me and after 1 minute was able to rouse me (I remember falling but no more).

This morning the same dizzy symptoms and nausea occured while lying in bed. It was first thing in the morning and unusually my h/r was 75 then dropped suddenly to 45 within a minute.

First abnormal ekg. Sinus rhythm old anteroseptal infarction. How concerned should I be. No history of heart disease. Have high cholesterol, controlled on meds, but still have high triglycerides. Blood pressure usually normal, but bottom number slightly elevated this appt","Doctor":"Hello, There, being a diabetic predisposes you to atherosclerotic heart disease. And to add to this, diabetics are more likely to have no symptoms or even have atypical symptoms of heart disease due to diabetic neuropathy. The ECG finding of anteroseptal wall ischemia proves that a blood vessel in the heart had been having low levels of oxygen most likely due to cholesterol build up in its walls. Also having high cholesterol levels adds up to the risk of heart disease. Therefore all of your risk factors should be controlled in order to have an optimal heart health. Proper control of blood sugar and cholesterol is paramount, and heart medications should be taken in order to prevent a heart attack.

In some people, you can hear the clicking without a stethoscope. If the clicking stopped momentarily, and then you heard double clicking, you might have went into an arrhythmia. During arrhythmias, you heard beats so fast that the mechanical valve does not have time to close, and therefore, you wont hear the clicking temporarily. Arrhythmias are commonly caused by coronary artery disease, hypertension, electrolyte abnormalities, valvular heart disease, congestive heart failure, and heart surgery, as well as thyroid disease, endocrine diseases, illnesses, and kidney failure. You will need to get routine screening blood work to check your electrolytes, as well as an EKG. If you missed any of your medications, this could also be contributing. I would recommend getting seen by your cardiologist. You might need medication adjustment."},{"Patient":"my father was having irrhythmia and i took him to doctor 3 years back and he prescribed him norvasc, concor and lipitor and now he is continously using it but now one of our family doctor advised us that we should stop beta blocker i have not been able to meet the physician who prescribed him that medicine bur my father has stopped taking it.please advise is there any connection of irrhytmia with conocr as now he is fine and having no issiue what so ever.","Doctor":"Arrhythmias are usually caused by heart disease such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, electrolyte abnormalities, valvular heart disease, congestive heart failure, as well as thyroid disease, kidney disease,  and lung diseases. Therefore the question you're asking is very difficult because it is based on the disease that is causing the arrhythmia. Generally speaking, beta blockers are the first line treatment for arryhtmias. However, if the heart rate becomes too slow then that is a contraindication to beta blockers. Additionally, some people can have side effects such as difficulty breathing would be up blockers. And therefore they should be to a calcium channel blocker.  Some people can also convert back to a normal sinus rhythm which means they would no longer need a beta blocker."},{"Patient":"Undergone Angio Plasty on 16.6.11.Doctor advised me that I should use Ecosprin 150mg life long; has to use Clopitab 75mg for one year & Prolomet XL 75mg for two years.I am diabetic and already using Human Mixtard(both day & night-18units) & Actrapid 8-10units before lunch & Glocomet 500 x3times after food.

Is the pain triggered by body movements or respiration? This could indicate possible musculoskeletal pain. - gastro-esophageal reflux or esophageal spasms. This is less probable as your symptoms are not triggered by any specific type of food. - anxiety could mimic all this clinical situation. As your symptoms have been going on for a long period, I would exclude other serious causes. I would recommend making a trial: taking ibuprofen. If your symptoms are relieved by ibuprofen, this would indicate a musculoskeletal pain. Otherwise, if your symptoms are not relieved by ibuprofen, I would recommend trying alprazolam. The relief of your symptoms by alprazolam would indicate anxiety as the main cause of your symptoms. And at last, try an antiacid or PPI (omeprazole, lansoprazole, etc.). The relief of your symptoms by any of these drugs would indicate gastroesophageal reflux or any other similar disorders.

Anemia can exacerbate all this clinical situation, causing low blood pressure and low oxygenation of the brain cells.

Medications recommended are the following: 1. Antiplatelets like aspirin or clopidogrel, depending on the tolerability and type of heart attack, which lowers the risk of another heart attack. 2. Statins like Atorvastatin or rosuvastatin which lower cholesgerol and helps in the stabilization  of the clot in the blood vessel. 3. Beta-blockers like metoprolol, carvedilol, nebivolol, and atenolol, which lowers the frequency of chest pains and also has a good effect on the overall heart health of the patient. 4. Medications for hypertension like Captopril, Enalapril, Losartan, Irbesartan and the like, which aside from controlling hypertension, also has a good effect on the heart muscle affected by the heart attack. 5. Medications which may be taken on an event of chest pain for relief, as Isordil has taken sublingually, or those taken as maintenance like Trimetazidine, Ranolazine or Nicorandil.

I don't have a lot of details though. He has a history of cardiac problems, including open heart surgery. He is on many cardiac meds for the last several years. Recently he has been experiencing episodes of dizziness where he just about blacks out. He has been to the ER 3 times in the past week and the doctors just keep saying its syncope. I am not convinced that there isn't something else wrong, perhaps related to his cardiac history. Any ideas on what may cause this? Also the other symptom he is having is blotchy, red skin. He is sweaty, and clammy.. and shivering. And extremely tired. BS was 119 non fasting.","Doctor":"His symptoms are due to worsening of his heart condition until proven otherwise. Therefore, he needs to see his cardiology or be seen at a heart hospital immediately. He should have an ultrasound of this heart, routine blood work screening, EKG, and medication reconciliation. If those are unremarkable, then he needs a stress test. It is important to distinguish between vertigo, presyncope (patient feels like they are going to black out; vision and hearing may become obscured), disequilibrium (off balance), and light-headedness (vague, inconsistent symptoms, no rotational component). Vertigo is the sensation of movement (\\"room spinning\\") when no movement is actually occurring; results from peripheral or central causes or may be induced by medications/anxiety disorders."},{"Patient":"Can medication be used to control moderate per infarct eschemia with no wall motion abnormalities and an ejection fraction  of 72%.

There are those that come from the intrinsic disease of the heart, like valvular heart disease and cardiac arrhythmias, as well as thyroid disease; and those that are from extrinsic causes like medications, alcohol, and caffeine intake. Palpitations should be worked out to determine the primary cause. If extrinsic causes are eliminated, with the palpitations still persisitent. It is important to check for the thyroid function to note for hyper and hypothyroidism which themselves cause palpitations. Palpitations with the normal treadmill stress test and ECG may also warrant the use of Holter monitors, event recorders, and even implantable loop recorders to note for intermittent arrhythmias causing the palpitations. And with this, it is important to stop taking medications, alcohol, and caffeine to rule out palpitations caused by modifiable factors. Hope I have answered your query.

My wife hospitalized since November 2010 till February 2011 due to Acute Pancreatitis. Also doctors diagonized that she is having a severe heart problem. I am explaining the whole history of the hospitalization of the patient, just i would like to know opinion / suggestion on the patient's situation.History of the Patient:In  01-11-2010,  the patient was ( with symptoms: abdomen pain,back pain and vomiting) admitted in Bollineni Superspeciality Hospital, Nellore, AP. There we realized that she is suffering from severe \\"Acute Pancreatitis, Cholelithiasis\\".  Immediately shifted to Vijaya Heart Foundation hospital, Chennai. Treated 27 days with various expensive antibiotics, but no use. Infection not able to controlled. She suffered from constant fever due to infection fluid collections in the abdomen formed in the form of packets.We demanded to discharge her on 27th day and shifted her to \\"Asian Institute of Gastroenterology\\" (AIG) hospital, Hyderabad. Medical treatment started on the admitted day itself by giving so many expensive anti-biotics. CT scan radiologist kept 2 tubes into the stomach at left side to drain the fluid collections, but right side they are not able to put the tubes as the organs are there and also fluid collections are very thick. After 3 weeks doctors planned to do major surgery as right side collections are not draining and due to this she is suffering from constant high fever. As per Cardiologist opinion, they kept the surgery on hold as she is have another issue in the heart. Heart left ventricle's ejecting factor(EF) recorded to 27% only which is severe dysfunction and high risk of giving anesthesia while surgery. After that they tried to improve the functionality, but in the span of just 2 weeks by giving medicines, it improved to 30%.Due to this, doctors changed the opinion of surgery for the time being. CT Scan radiologist hardly tried and kept another 2 tubes into stomach through the right side of the abdomen.That way the draining is started in right side also.  Every day giving her expensive anti-biotic medicines to control the infection, doing fluid culture tests, blood tests to check Albumin, hemoglobin % and also Liver Functional Test, not to spread across the other organs. At the same time trying to improve the heart functionality, controlling the blood sugar by giving the Insulin in a daily basis. Likewise CT scan radiologist kept total 6 tubes into abdomen in both sides to drain all the infection fluid.The root cause for all these: \\"formation of stones in the gall bladder, travelled through the bile duct and stuck at the Pancreas head\\". Doctors want to remove the gallbladder after few months of bed rest as again the existing small stones might travel. Frequent reviews and checkups after discharge (on 27-Feb-11 ) from AIG hospital. All Tubes removed from abdomen and found 'no collections' by CT review.Planned to do open Cholecystectomy surgery at AIG on 20th May'11. But Cardiologist given the opinion as \\"High risk for surgery\\" as she is having the \\"Dilated Cardiomyopathy\\" (Severe dysfunction with 32% LV ejecting factor). Anesthesiologist  saying that on giving the anesthesia, they are not sure how the heart will respond while surgery. Went to Vijaya Heart Foundation (VHF) hospital, Chennai. VHF Cardiologist given opinion as \\"Fit for high risk surgery\\" by taking 2D ECHO. Doctor in AIG hospital told to come back after 30 to 45 days for Cholecystectomy surgery and should take 10 to 20% risk on the surgery inaddition to precautions. As she is diabetic, and presently she is having 347 points in random blood test, consulted Endocrinologist to control blood sugar. Now sugar is under process to control.Present In-take Medicines (For heart issue):Name                          Dosage  Aldactone 25mg tab: 1 - 0 - 1Lasix 20 mg    tablet  : 1 - 0 - 0Carnisure 500 tablet  : 1 - 0 - 1 (Stopped now)Coversyl 2mg tablet  : 1 - 0 - 0Ivabradibe 5mg        : 1 - 0 - 1For Pancreas issue:Creon 25000  capsules: 1 - 1 - 1Request you to provide your valuable opinion / suggestions / medications (to control Dilated Cardiomyopathy) to overcome or reduce the risk factor in a short period of time and to become fit for surgery with a minimal risk factor.Please prescribe / suggest, if any using medicines required to change for quick improvement of heart. Because those above listed medicines (for heart) are using from middle of December 2010 to till date. But improvement is not observing much and not that much effective.Awaiting for your reply.Thanks a lot.Regards,Siva Prasad K VBANGALORE, Karnataka, INDIA+91-0000","Doctor":"Hi,Its so good of you to give such a detailed history. But you left the age. Still dcmp with reduced heart function in this state can be because of sepsis. As she is diabetic dcmp can also be due to coronary disease.

I suggested hydrocodone , but she is concerned that it might cause atrial fibrillation.  Is this pain killer not indicated?","Doctor":"Atrial fibrillation is a arrhythmia characterized by rapid, uncoordinated electrical activity and an irregularly irregular heart response. Medications are usually not a cause of atrial fibrillation unless they cause an electrolyte abnormality. Generally A. Fib. is caused by hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, obesity, and lung disease. Alcohol and caffeine, as well as hyperthyroidism and diabetes have also been associated with A. Fib. Therefore, to reduce your risk of atrial fibrillation, you should adequate control your blood pressure, loss weight, and avoid alcohol. I would not recommend hydrocodone long term for the hip pain. Your best option is to find a primary care doctor that can do any injection into the hip. The injection will relieve the pain, associated swelling, and hopefully the pinched nerve. In the meantime, I would continue ibuprofen and tylenol. Also, rest and ice will help."},{"Patient":"I am 70, male, 190lbs, 5'10\\"  I have been doing some hard work cleaning mildew from the sides of my house.

A drop in blood pressure like this could be from valvular disease, arrhythmias, dehydration, or vascular disease from diabetes. Additionally, it could be caused by cardiomyopathy which is damage or dysfunction of the heart muscle. I would continue taking your medication as prescribed. Drink plenty of fluids.

It sounds like you are having vasovagal syncope, or presyncope, which occurs when your body overreacts to certain emotional triggers, such as the sight of blood, or emotional distress/anxiety. The vasovagal syncope trigger causes your heart rate and blood pressure to drop suddenly, but you may have pre-syncope, which occurs right before this phase. During syncope, there is reduced blood flow to your brain, which can even cause you to briefly lose consciousness. This condition would be best evaluated by a medical doctor or cardiologist, who could provide you with a recorder called a holter monitor to monitor how your heart is beating."},{"Patient":"I am a 91 year old man suffering from low energy levels over past several  years and it is continuing to worsen daily.

Chorella is a health supplement and has various effects on different  body systems partly related to its anti oxidant effect .

They come from no where and can last half a day or a couple of hours. There has never been any pain at all but it makes me feel very lite headed and sometimes I get a a slight headache. I have been in the ER twice with this. The last time was by ambulance as my son is an EMT. They kept me and all the test were fine although each episode my bloodwork shows low potassium. The Cardiologist didn t feel worried and said that it may be something I get from time to time.???????? He put me on a low dose of blood pressure meds but was reluctent because it was fine. I now take Potassium, Maxide for edema, estrigen (Complete historectomy last nov.) low dose of BP meds. Plus asprin. This is wearing me out and frustrated.","Doctor":"Hi, Maxide (Triamterene) is a potassium-sparing diuretic and you are unlikely to get low potassium as you are taking potassium supplement as well. High carbohydrate meal at times precipitates hypokalemia. Hidden sympathomimetics, such as pseudoephedrine and ephedrine in cough syrup or dieting agents, may also cause unexpected hypokalemia. Finally, marked ingestion (dietary caffeine) may also cause hypokalemia. Hypokalemia is a major risk factor for both ventricular and atrial arrhythmias (palpitations). Blood pressure improves with the establishment of normokalemia. Aspirin is given as an antiplatelet drug in patients with high cardiovascular risk as primary or secondary prevention. Estrogens do not cause hypokalemia. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I m a 21 year old, 5 8, 175 pound woman and consider myself decently healthy. I eat well when I can although I do make poor food choices. I am also not very active as I work at a call centre and sit at a desk all day. I don t drink as much water as I should. I have also been smoking marijuana consistently for 6 years, mostly through a glass bong with at least 1 perculator. Within the last 2 years I have been smoking something called poppers , which is a layer of tobacco from a cigarette with a layer of marijuana smoked through a bong. It creates a strong headrush and intense feelings of relaxation, causing me to want to lay myself down as if it was overwhelming my body like heroin (I have never done heroin but I have seen people react that way to it before) I know it is very bad for me because the carcinogens from smoke is obviously bad, especially cigarette tabacco that s mixed with marijuana and only filtered through water, but I want to know what it s doing to my organs and body functions in the long run. The problem is that I don t think there have been many studies on poppers because it is a relatively new and still underground method of smoking marijuana so its hard to find reliable information. Recently my heart has been occasionally feeling strange. I will be relaxed either sitting or standing and breathing and I will breathe out slowly, then feel my heart almost lump up and beat in my throat, it scares me and I take a deep breath in to counteract it, and for a second I almost feel like its going to stop beating. Then its all good again. What s happening to my organs and why is my heart doing this? Thank you for taking the time to read this and reply!","Doctor":"Hello , The heart beats you are feeling is because of the ill effects of poppers on your heart as the tobacco would make the heart pump stronger and faster giving you the symptoms you have described.  As you have truly said that the effects op poppers haven't been studied however all the ill effects  of tobacco applies here ranging from hypertension , stroke , heart issues , lung damage to various cancers . Also the effect is compounded by weed . It's not wise to use poppers as the sudden surge in body metabolic is not good . Regards"},{"Patient":"Thank you for being there.

Coronary angiogram would be the test of choice to examine better the blood flow in his coronary arteries. Meanwhile, I would recommend avoiding straining physical activity and hot or cold weather. Nitroglycerin would be helpful during chest pain.Hope you will find this answer helpful!Kind regards, Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"Since moving to a new community 2 years ago, I have been advised by my cardiologist to have a nuclear stress test each year. My overall condition seems to be stable and I am wondering if this test is necessary on an annual basis and what the negative effects of nuclear exposure might be.","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that this test is quite safe. It can be associated so some rare adverse effects like : cardiac arrhythmia, allergic reaction, heart attack or chest pain, but they have been observed in a very low percent of patients who go through this test. There is no accumulation of the substances in your body after repeated tests. So, there is no risk of accumulation after some years. I would recommend repeating cardiac stress test every year, instead of this test , because it is less invasive and you do not need any injections. Only if suspicions are raised in cardiac stress tests, nuclear stress test should be done.

It can manifest as chest discomfort (angina) due to myocardial (heart) ischemia or as acute coronary syndrome (heart attack). Typical angina exhibits substernal chest tightness, pressure, or heaviness that frequently radiates to the jaw, back, or arms and generally lasts from 2 to 15 minutes. It can occur with exertion, emotional stress, or exercise. If you have any of those symptoms, you should go to the emergency room. CAD is the leading cause of death for adults both in the United States and worldwide. Below are some risk factors and general preventive measures. However, you should see a doctor to have routine blood work to make sure you do not have high cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure, or renal disease. A doctor can also help you lose weight if needed, or stop smoking if needed. Do not start an exercise regimen until approved so by your doctor. Aspirin (75 to 162 mg/day) decreases risk of first MI and reduces adverse cardiovascular events in those with stable angina. The benefits significantly outweigh the risk.• Traditional risk factors: hypertension (high blood pressure), High cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, premature CAD in 1st-degree relatives (men 45 for men, >55 for women)• Nontraditional risk factors: obesity, sedentary lifestyle, renal diseaseGENERAL PREVENTION• Smoking cessation• Regular aerobic exercise program• Weight loss for obese patients (goal BMI • BP control (goal • Diabetes management• Lipid-lowering therapy (statins) for those with diabetes, known CAD, and for 10-year risk ≥7.5%• Low-dose aspirin"},{"Patient":"Just checked my BP and it says 133/96 with a heartbeat of 82.

I woke up and my heart was pounding rapidly and extremely hard and shortness of breath.  I could feel it from the top of my head to the ends of my toes.  I got up, took a couple aspirin, waited about 30 minutes to an hour and went back to bed.  Since then I have had rapid heart rates, fluttering in my heart, elevated pulse rates, shortness of breath, constant nagging chest pains, with numbness and tingling, radiating up into my neck and down my left arm and thru to the center of my back.  I also can feel a constant heart beat in my stomach, between my rib cage. There is also a constant heavy feeling with a lot of stomach swellling/ bloating with fatique, not wanting to do much of anything but I have to.

You should see a hematologist.Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM.Heart palpitations usually aren't serious or harmful, though, and often go away on their own as in your case. The palpitations may be due to different causes such as stress, anxiety, hyperthyroidism, anemia, low blood pressure, dehydration, abnormal electrolyte levels etc.In rare cases, palpitations can be a sign of a more serious heart condition. In your case, being carrier of a thalasemic trait, the most probable cause of these symptoms, can be anemia. You should have a full blood count exam, ferritinemia, sideremia, and hemoglobin electrophoresis. After that you should see a hematologist to discuss about the treatment and follow up. Once anemia is corrected, your symptoms will go away. If you still have palpitations (rapid heart beats) after anemia treatment then you should be checked for other causes of anemia too. You should test the thyroid hormones level (TSH, fT3, fT4), the electrolytes (Na, k, Cl,Ca) levels in blood, and you should make an ECG and see a cardiologist too.Meanwhile you should take plenty of water (2 - 3 liters per day).Try to avoid getting stressed or anxious.Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications.

I understand your concern.A cough is a common cold symptom. It's the body's way of getting rid of phlegm or mucus. But as your cough persists and is associated with dyspnea (respiratory difficulties) and coughing up blood, you need to see pneumologist. He will make a accurate physical examination of the lungs and will guide you into further examinations needed.You may need a chest radiography, full blood count and sputum examination.There are different causes of coughing up blood such as: bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pneumonia, some reumatologic disorders, pulmonary thromboembolism ect. Bronchitis is the most common cause and the most probable in your case. Coughing up blood due to bronchitis is rarely life-threatening. So don't be to much worried. Your symptoms can be made worse by smoking. So, don't smoke and don't allow others to smoke in your home.Stay away from or reduce your time around things that irritate your nose, throat, and lungs, such as dust or pets.Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications.

It causes orthostatic hypotension, causing a decrease in blood pressure when standing up. This contributes to chronic fatigue and difficulty in the body balance. From the other hand it also affects the cerebellum, which is the posterior part of our brain, which is the main region of our brain to help maintain our body balance. So unsteady gait is another feature of this disorder. Unfortunately there is no cure to this disorder and no treatment is possible for these symptoms.

You should be guided by an internal medicine doctor, for a more accurate etiological diagnosis and to adjust your medical therapy .Detailed answer:Thank you for using HCM. First of all, more than a therapeutic approach, I would suggest you to undergo further radiologic examinations, and laboratory exams, in way to detect any possible cause of your high blood pressure. Your symptoms during the high blood pressure episodes,  may be suggestive to secondary possible causes of hypertension such as Cushing syndrome , Pheocromocitoma, Hyperaldosteronism, Hyperthyroidism, Sleep apnea, Acromegaly, etc. But for being more precise into guiding you, i would need more anamnestic data and a detailed physical examination. That's why i suggest yo to see an internist who may lead you in detecting the causing factor of your hypertension.In most of the cases in, eventhough you do all tests for secondary causes , it doesn't get out nothing. At this case we are in front of an idiopathic hypertension, which we have to deal with. Regarding to your actual treatment, atenolol is not the first choice, for blood pressure treatment, but as you may have high heart rate, your doctor has chosen it to treat you. It lowers the heart rate, leading to low blood pressure. But as you are still having this attacks even under atenolol, it means that it is not enough for your full treatment. You should make a 24 h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring . If you have a persistent blood pressure higher than 140/90 mmHg additional blood pressure reduction should be achieved, increasing the atenolol dosage or adding any other drug such as enalapril, lisinopril etc.Atenolol may cause: slow or uneven heartbeats feeling light-headed, fainting feeling short of breath, (when is taken in higher dosage than needed), swelling of your ankles or feet, nausea, stomach pain, low fever, loss of appetite, dark urine, etc.You should avoid drinking alcohol, which could increase drowsiness and dizziness while you are taking atenolol.You should stop smoking as it has seen that the resting and exercise heart rates were significantly greater in smokers than no-smoker patients.Meanwhile, you should do effective lifestyle changes for controlling blood pressure, such as : weight loss , regular physical activity — at least 30 minutes 3 days of the week, eating a diet that is rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products. You should restrict the salt quantity that you take with food.Try not to get stressed.Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications.

For this reason, I would recommend you to closely monitor your heart rate and blood pressure values in the next days. If high blood pressure values persist, I would recommend performing some other tests: - a resting ECG - complete blood count, PCR, ESR for inflammation - thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction - blood electrolytes - fasting glucose - kidney and liver function tests.

Usually when a patient has inducible ischemia we perform coronary angiography to see how many heart arteries are affected and how is the percentage of the blockage, and the further tactic of treatment of inducible ischemia depends on the results of coronary angiography. So you should also discuss the possibility of coronary angiography with your doctor.About the swelling legs, it can be caused either by heart problems or by medications or leg vessels problems.

Lately, I've been having a heaviness in my chest with the need to burp during the day. Have also felt light-headed a few times. Last night the heaviness woke me up at 3am.I almost felt the need to call 911 for help. My resting heart rate is normally 60 or below and I have no symptoms whatsoever when I am running. I'm concerned that I have some type of heart problem. Can you help me understand what is wrong? I thought about hiatal hernia as pressing downward below my ribcage sometimes helps, but last night just seemed more intense.","Doctor":"Hello, I am Dr. Mody and I would be addressing your concern. The symptoms related to the heart generally aggravate while you are exerting like climbing stairs or running , which is not present in your case making heart as the cause of symptoms lot the first differential. The symptoms of GERD ( reflux gastritis ) due to hiatus can particularly occur while you lie down as reflux is more during sleeping or after heaving meals . However considering your age , it's prudent that heart is ruled out first as many a times it doesn't present with the classical presentation . A Ekg and than TMT ( treadmill stress test ) would be a good test to do the same . If normal one can consider treating om the line of GERD.

Though I took a BP pill 5 and 1/2 hrs ago ... can I take another one soon.  MY head and neck are killing me and my head is going to explode,.My eyeballs are so sore,","Doctor":"Hello,The Headache and soreness of eyes both are related to the blood pressure being on the higher side . An disturbing fact that diastolic  ( lower ) blood pressure is really high .You have to take anti hypertensive medication in such setting , maybe the one you are on is not working good enough . So increasing the dose of same or adding another is the way forward.  A visit to a doctor who can do the same is strongly suggested.  Lastly along with blood pressure when the pulse is too high it would suggest anxiety as a common accomplishment . So try calming down as by being more anxious,  the pressure would still fly to higher values .

Is this something we should be concerned with, or possibly related to the basilar vertigo migraines (will check also with our paedatric neurologist.Any feedback would be welcomed.CheersMatt","Doctor":"Hello Matt , I am Dr. Mody and I would be addressing your concern.  Autonomic dysfunction is very commonly associated with basilar migraine.  Here the balance between the two systems namely. Sympathetic and para sympathetic is not maintained . Overactivity of sympathetic system would make her heart beat more forcefully and faster sometimes erratically due to some extra beats or change in rhythm,  causing Palpitation.  Also if she has been advised sumatriptan or ergotamine for treatment , this per say would increase palpitation by increasing  sympathetic activity.

Her heart is reportedly functioning at 25% according to her doctor.  what does a healthy heart usually function at?  she is also having a lot of fluid buildup.  Does this indicate anything in relation to her heart?","Doctor":"Hello , What you have mentioned is called ejection fraction . Anything above 55 % is called nomral . So for your sister the heart is working at nearly half nomral . There is a  fluid build up and in  all probability it  is  because of a weak heart . When the function of heart is low , less blood is supplied to the kidneys which in turn mis quotes it as lack of enough blood in the circulation and over the period of time accumulates fluid to increase the quantity of circulation.  Optimisation of medication  and treatment to strengthen the heart according to the cause would help her . Regards Dr Priyank Mody"},{"Patient":"My husband has one kidney. He had the other removed when he was a baby. He was in an accident about a little over a year ago. This accident has caused him to get an amputation. from all that has happened he now has high blood pressure. Is it true that the doctor cannot place him on any medicine due to the fact that has one kidney? If so, what home remedies can he take?","Doctor":"Hello , It's a misconception that anti hypertensive medications cannot be given in Single kidney , Rather blood pressure should be aggressively controlled and kept below 135 / 85 by all means , because it's a priority to save the single kidney from ill effects of hypertension.  Calcium channel blockers , beta blockers  would be safest if you are in a place where monitoring is not available.

It is important to closely monitor your blood pressure (frequent times during the day in sitting position after 10 minutes of total relax) and refer those values to your doctor. If your blood pressure values are above 130/85 mm Hg most of the time, you may need to start antihypertensive therapy. From the other hand, I would recommend performing some other tests to investigate for the possible cause of elevated blood pressure values: - a chest X ray study- some blood lab tests (complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, PCR, sedimentation rate, blood electrolytes, fasting glucose, kidney and liver function tests, blood lipid profile)A sinus X ray study would help exclude possible sinus infection related to the eye pressure and headache. You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests.

Unfortunately over Christmas I had two or three AFIB events each of which subsided after a few hours and where my pulse fortunately never reached over 124 ppm ( at least when I checked it ). The reason for the events was probably due to over indulgence in foods that may have had higher levels of sodium chloride at the same time as drinking a lot of wine and on one occasion brandy. On a normal day my pulse is 49 to 52 in the morning and seldom gets above 65 even after some fairly heavy physical activity. It does go up to mid to high 60 s if I have two or three glasses of wine. Normally of course I am on a very low salt diet as my wife and I make almost everything from scratch ourselves without adding sodium chloride. The reason I am writing is that early March we are traveling to Australia for a month followed by a month cruising back to the US. I don t know whether I will be able to get low or no salt food on board the ship. I m wondering whether an even higher dose of coureg might be advisable during the trip to counter the unknown levels of salt I will encounter on the voyage. Thanx Keith Jones","Doctor":"Hello , Your dosage or Carvedilol is optimum and increasing it at present is not justified as you  already have  low boderline pulse ( 50 ) at rest and increasing the dose may bring it more low which would cause fatigue and weakness on routine activity . Mostly you would be able to tolerate normal salt in cooking . Just avoid breads , bakery products and preserved food as they have higher salt content . Avoid bing drinking and particularly beer. If you have a Atrial fibrillation episode , taking a higher dose eg 25 mg max of carvedilol single dose , would be ok . But taking on routine basis is not a good idea . Also discuss the need for anti coagulation with your doctor on next visit.

My age is 41, my height is 5' 2 my weight is 150 pounds.","Doctor":"Brief Answer:There are different causes of high heart rate.You should do further examinations. Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM. High heart rate episodes, usually aren't serious or harmful, though, and often go away on their own. Most of the time, they're related to stress and anxiety or to consumption of stimulants such as caffeine etc.Even though, heart palpitations may occur in specific medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism, or anemia, low blood pressure, dehydration, abnormal electrolyte levels etc.In rare cases, palpitations can be a sign of a more serious heart condition. A laboratory assessment of the thyroid hormones levels (TSH, fT3, fT4) should be done to exclude a hyperthyroidism. If it will be proven by the results of the above mentioned levels of the thyroid hormones, you should see an endocrinologist for further treatment strategy and follow-up. Electrolyte levels assessment (Na, K, Cl, Ca) is essential, too and their correction (if deviations are noted) is necessary. Anemia can be ruled out by making a full blood count exam. If anemia is proven, you should treat it and your palpitations will go away. To be very careful, you should make an ECG ate the moment of the high rate episodes or you should take a Holter ECG which registers your heart rate during the period you keep it. The results should be discussed with the cardiologist. If all the above mentioned exams are normal, than stress and anxiety remain the most probable causing factor of your symptoms.Meanwhile you should take plenty of water (2 - 3 liters per day).You should take an equilibrated diet.Try to avoid getting stressed or anxious.Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications.

Its not continous and keeps coming now and then. Also, she says she has a weakness around her heart everytime this happens. We got CT scan doen today and it shows 'a tiny oblong hypodensity seen in left parasagittal top parietal location, with ipsilateral ventricle pulling towards it - possibly represents subacute to chronic infarction. In addition multiple tiny, hypodensities seen both gangliocapsular and periventricular locations (left top parietal region more involved), with no mass effect or bleed - could suggest old lacunar infartions.' Rest is shown normal for age. What does this mean?","Doctor":"Brief Answer: Old infarction areas without any emergency meaning. Should be followed by a cardiologist.Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM. I will try to explain what this CT scan report means.A left parietal, parasagital tiny oblong hypodensity, suggestive of a subacute or chronic infarction represents a small, linear area of lower density on CT, than the rest of the normal brain, due to a previous (old) arterial thrombosis on the top the brain cortex, close to (along) the sagital superior sinus, of the left parietal lobe. Local necrosis around the ischaemic (thrombosed) area is followed by liquefaction of the brain tissue and hypodense appearance on CT. This area, as well as the other multiple tiny hypodense areas in the deeper brain structures (gangliocapsular and periventricular old lacunar infarctions) are associated with ipsilateral ventricle pulling which means dilatation (enlargement) of the lateral ventricle on the affected side. Local volume loss due to infarction and liquefaction, creates local vacuum areas which enable the left lateral ventricle (a cerebrospinal fluid filled cavity) to distend toward the vacuum area. As all these findings do not represent a recent (fresh) infarction, but old ones, there is no reason to seriously worry about.  Heart problems, more than a consequence, may be the reason of the above mentioned brain infarctions. That’s why a special care should be carried to prevent further infarctions, such as normal blood pressure maintaining, restricted salt diet and regular cardiologist follow-up.

Before she was on the meds. it was fast then too.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!I carefully passed through your question and would explain that it is important performing some tests to investigate for the possible cause of her elevated heart rate: - a complete blood count for chronic anemia- blood electrolytes for possible imbalance- thyroid hormone levels for possible thyroid gland dysfunction- a cardiac ultrasound to examine her heart function and structure- a cardiac stress test to investigate for possible coronary artery disease (as she has coronary risk factors like diabetes)- an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring to exclude possible cardiac arrhythmia. You should discuss with her attending physician on the above tests.

When it starts to hurt she gets real anxious and cries but then it goes away and she is all normal again. Could this be just an anxiety problem or something else?","Doctor":"Hi, Chest pain should never be underestimated and every type of chest pain should be evaluated to rule out whether it is of the cardiac origin. BP of 120/72 is normal and generally not associated with chest pain. Cardiac chest pain occurs after exercise or exertion and relieves after rest. I'll advise you to get an ECG and stress test done for her to rule out whether it is cardiac associated or not. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I would recommend consulting with your attending physician and performing some tests to investigate for possible secondary causes of high blood pressure : - a resting ECG- a chest X ray study- lab blood tests (complete blood count, HbA1C, blood electrolytes, kidney and liver function tests, thyroid hormone levels, blood lipid profile)- Doppler ultrasound of the cervical vessels to examine the blood flow to the brain and exclude possible vessel stenosis- a cervical spine X ray study to exclude possible cervical backbone chronic degenerations which could lead to dizziness. I recommend discussing with your doctor on the possibility of making some changes to your actual diabetic therapy (increase the dose of insuline) and start antihypertensive therapy (a calcium channel blocker or ACEI). Optimizing the antidiabetic therapy would also help manage better your blood pressure.

I am a 57 y.o. female with djd in joints and ileosacral spinal djd for which I recieve steroids injection in my L knee every 4 to 6 months. I have a total knee replacement as of march this past year. My bp is borderline for which I take 1/2 half tab hctz and pain meds along with prilosec qd. My doctor has notified me I had to start Zorcor for my cholesterol. I do not like taking loads of meds. Can my cholesterol elevation be caused bythe steroids injections. I walk and use my wii to exercise daily and water aeorobics 2x a week. I don't want to starttaking more meds especially after reading the side effects. Do I have a valid point?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that total levels of cholesterol is not a confident indicator of your cardio-vascular risk. A Total cholesterol/ LDL ratio more than 4.5 could indicate a higher cardio-vascular risk related to dyslipidemia and the necessity of statin intake. From the other hand, it is true that steroids cause elevation of cholesterol levels. So, for the moment, I would recommend some modifications to your diet (reduce saturated fat and increase food rich in omega 3 fatty acids). As soon as you will stop taking steroids, your cholesterol levels will return to normal again.

But, based on your symptoms, it is important performing further tests to investigate for the possible causes: - a cardiac ultrasound to examine your cardiac function and exclude possible cardiomyopathy or heart failure- a cardiac stress test to investigate for possible coronary artery disease- some blood lab tests (complete blood count for anemia, thyroid hormone levels for possible dysfunction, cortisol plasma levels for possible adrenal gland dysfunction, blood electrolytes for possible imbalance).

An elevation of the diaphragm or abdominal distension could cause this clinical scenario. From the other hand the heart lies right over the diaphragm.

I am scheduled to have this procedure done this Thursday.  I have been put on Plavex and asa.  Do you think that this is the best treatment in my situation?","Doctor":"Hello if you are non diabetic and because it's a single artery Lad , angioplasty would give equivalent results and bypass would surely not be needed , however other technical issues like the calcium content  , curvature of artery  are important to decide about angioplasty which can be commented after reviewing the angiogram.  However as your cardiologist have said angioplasty with 1 or 2 stents depending on the location of lesions would be a ideal way forward.  Do continue Asa and plain atleast for 1 year post procedure afterwards single antiplatlet would be ok . Also if possible opt for a Drug eluting stent.

The internist heard a murmur and he was referred for a TEE.  The cardiologist said the hole is small and he was told to come back for another test in one year.  Interestingly, he was told that he has high blood pressure.  He is also a smoker and was told to cease.

Hence most of the PFO require no treatment and hence should be left alone . Hyper blood pressure is not related to PFO , however it per say increase the flow through the opening causing the murmur . Yes he should stop smoking , consider low salt diet , omit junk food and consider anaerobic exercise to bring the blood pressure under control. Per say just a follow up after a year to know if there is any increase in size and reassess other associated  finding would be enough .

Nevertheless, I would recommend performing further tests in order to exclude any possible cardiac disorders: - a cardiac ultrasound to examine your heart function and structure - an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring in order to exclude possible cardiac arrhythmia.

I smoke about 10 cigarettes a day, have never done recreational drugs and only drink occasionally. 4 months ago I passed 3 kidney stones.  I gave birth to 3 children and had 3 late term miscarriages (4 to 6 mo along).  2 of my children I had to have progesterone shots in order to carry them to term.  After the last one I had severe bleeding issues for over a year causing me to have a partial hysterectomy, I still have my overies.  4 years ago I was diagnosed with high blood pressure and have been on and off medication since, at times it would be under control without medication.  For 2 years now I have continually been told that I have a high red blood count and have had to undergo a phlembotomy several times because of it.  I currently have high blood pressure, sometimes as high as 190/140 or so.  I have a head ache almost all the time.  I have noticed times that my heart seems to beat very very hard or flutter for short times and it causes tension in my chest.  Different doctors have run so many tests and can't tell me why any of this happens.  They don't know what has caused the high red count.  I also have leg pain and swelling which worsens in cold weather and it doesn't really change with activity or rest, they feel very heavy at times.  Most doctors dismiss this.  I am constantly being asked if I have a sunburn even though I don't.  I sweat horribly bad very often even from the slightest activity such as vacuuming in a 70 degree house.  I am constantly tired no matter how much sleep I get.  I have been diagnosed with minor sleep apnea but the machine doesn't seem to help me.
