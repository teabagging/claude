I do have 2 children, both of which delivered by c-sections, and have had my tubes tied. 9 months after my daughter was born is when my ordeal started. I woke up the one morning and got my cup of coffee like every other day, then went on field trip with my son for school. While there I became very hot and sweaty and within minutes, I was extremely nauseated. I ran to the bathroom and started vomiting. That was in October of 2004. I was in the ER several times that month and even admitted to the hospital for several days. They stuck the ng tube down my throat and removed two full containers of fluid from my stomach in about a 24 hour period. Problem was they could not figure out where the fluids was coming from. After numerous tests, including emptying studies, an endoscopy, CATScan and more, all they could come up with was the possibility it was a stomach virus that shut my digestive tract down. After over a year with the first hospital and several doctors, they refereed me to Geisinger. There too I spent several days in the ER and was admitted several times. They suspected Celiac disease while there, but after a few tests that too has been ruled out. The episodes do seem to coincide with my menstrual cycle allot of times. I was started on the depo shot to control my hormone levels because of the coincidence and after 2 doses it actually helped, no nausea and no vomiting for 9 months. Then back about 2008 I was diagnosed with Primary Billiary cirosis and as a results I was taken off the depo shot in Dec. 2008. By April 2009 I was back to vomiting again. May of 2009 I was started back on the depo shot a second time, but this time it had no effect. Again I was taken back off Feb 2010. After several years with Geisinger they referred me on to Hershey Medical. The doctors that I have now in Hershey seem to think that it is gastroparesis and set me a strict diet. My diet right now is basically liquids, cornflakes with skim milk, saltine crackers, pickled eggs once in while., but, there are times when I don t eat anything, or anything different and I still get sick. Most of the time it is as soon as I wake up. I awake to be extremely nauseated and after a bowel movement , the vomiting starts. Always thick yellow, thick green, or brownish color. I have seen some blood in with it also. The color changes to these throughout my episode, which can last 18 to 20 hours at a time, In the beginning I had it for 2 weeks straight if not longer. My blood pressure the last time I was at the ER was up to 151 over 102. I never had problems with my bp and still don t, only when I am sick, which nowadays is at least once or twice a week, at times though it can last the week. The same tests have been performed at all 3 hospitals and is not showing anything. I have also had 4 hernia surgeries, all of which are from the same hernia returning from the stress on my abdomen from the heavy vomiting. Now I have one above the mesh that needs repaired, which entails a whole new piece of mesh. The problem with vomiting started before the hernia surgeries. Morning are the worst being extremely nauseated every day. Now I never know what the day will bring. The episodes come on when it wants and goes when it wants. I pray maybe you have an answer. I need my life back!!! I am on my third hospital system (Williamsport, Geisinger and now Hershey) and still no answers. I started out at around 239 pounds and I am now at 125 pounds.

IS PORTAL HEPATOPATHY CURABLE????","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to HealthcareMagic Forum. Was he a Alcoholic? Your Dad's History suggests, he has Portal Hypertension which is an increase in the blood pressure within a system of veins called the portal venous system. What other symptoms does he have? The treatment for this focuses on preventing or managing the complications, especially the bleeding from the varices. Diet, medications, endoscopic therapy, surgery, and radiology procedures all have a role in treating or preventing the complications. He should stop drinking alcohol completely, He will probably be required to consume no more than 2 grams of sodium per day and reduce his Protein intake as well. If endoscopic therapy, drug therapy, and or dietary changes do not successfully control his variceal bleeding, he may require Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), This procedure involves placing a stent (a tubular device) in the middle of the liver. The stent connects the hepatic vein with the portal vein which reduces the Portal vein Blood Pressure.

So I got frightened at that time and i went through several tests to check whether the virus found will lead to Jaundice . Then with all the test reports I consulted a physician in Ramachandra Hospital and she said that you are normal but the virus in your blood will be there for long and it will ther in blood as a carrier and it will not lead to jaundice any way. At time I didnt got married and I asked the doctor , will there be any problem in having sex with my wife. The doctor replied that my wife need to put the vaccination injection for three times as a course( 1 month , 2 month and sixth month ). Now I got married and still I am afraid to have sex with my wife. Please give me a correct solution for this problem.","Doctor":"Dear Anon, This is turning into a phobia. You don't need to worry about passing on the Hep B virus to your life, as she is vaccinated ... but if she is not, then please DO get her vaccinated. In either case, it is possible to test her blood for both the Hep B antigen and antibody. If the antigen is present, she is a carrier like you, so no worries. If antibodies are found in the right amount, she is protected by Nature or vaccines already, so again no problem. If she has no antibody, vaccinate her. That's it. Problem almost solved. There are two more points to discuss: A. Transmission of Hep B by the sexual route is possible, but not that common. To protect her further, you may want to use a condom. B. If she gets vaccinated, she may take up to 15 days for antibodies to come up in her blood, and she would get protected only after the 2nd dose has been given. C. Oh yes, one more point: About 2% of humans do NOT form antibodies after natural or vaccine-acquired Hep B. If she is one of those, God help you. D. Last point: If, after all this, you are still panicking, please go to a counsellor first, before trying to do anything else. I am sorry, but the thing is, you are panicking. Just enjoy life. Get her vaccinated. That is all. Regards.

This is good news. However, I want to be clear that you do still need periodic follow-up to be certain that this remains the case. Hepatitis B status can change over time and become active. AASLD recommends follow-up ALT every 6 to 12 months if baseline is normal. certain number of people with hepatitis B become hepatitis B inactive carriers. This means they carry the hepatitis B virus, but they have normal liver enzymes and don’t have signs of significant liver inflammation. Even though the hepatitis B is inactive, hepatitis B inactive carriers are still at higher risk for health problems since the virus can become reactivated in up to twenty-five percent of cases – which leads to active inflammation and even cirrhosis. This occurs most commonly in people with decreased immunity.

The first one was in april of this year because I felt nausea all the time for about 2 months.

First one in april says 0.5 cm subscapsular low attenuation lesion in left lobe of liver.to small to accurately characterize. also a subcentimeter right renal cyst . Urinary bladder is underdisteded. And there were some cysts on pelvic wall likely ovarian, more numerous on the right than the left and together measuring 6 cm on right and 2 cm for the one on left pelvic wall. So, all that said...the Ct I just had the other day says left hepatic lobe lesions are stable. what does that mean? and minimal focal fatty infiltration along falciform ligament???? also,stable subcentimeter right renal cyst???? interval resalution of cysts noted along left pelvic sidewall on prior examination. 1,7 cm right anterior pelvic cyst is unchanged. two additional right pelvic cysts present on prior exam have resolved. impression was the pelvic cyst is likely ovarian in origin (I had left ovary and tube removed about 4 years ago due to a cyst of 6 cm which was benign and the tube was bad because endometriosis that I didnt know I had! stable subcentimeter hepatic low attenuation lesions and small right renal cyst. mild benign depression of the superior endplate of L1 (I have a herniated disc L4-5, and spinal stenosis and arthritis around a very old fracture from when I was a kid.

About 2 months ago now I came down with flu like symptoms that lasted about 3-4 days (fever, sore throat). These got better but then I started to feel really dizzy and had what would best be described as a bad \\"brain fog\\" for about 3 weeks. I went to the doctor during this time and they told me that it was probably just the afteraffects of the flu I'd just had, or possibly a slight inner ear infection. After the 3 weeks of dizzines the flue re-appeared with avengance. I had a sever sore throat, was running a fever over 100F and was extremely exhausted. I went back to the doctor and asked for a blood test. About 3 days later I got a call from the doctor saying I had tested positive for mononucleosis and that she needed me to come in to see her. She told me that my liver enzymes were extremely elevated. (AST 196 ALT 522) and that these needed to be watched. She asked me to wait a week and then go for another blood test which i did. I was still feeling pretty terrible, running fevers in the evening although my throat had gotten a bit better. When these results came in we found that they were even higher (AST 222 ALT 612) This lead her to believe that I was suffering from Acute Viral Hepatitis because of the Mono. She also asked me if I'd been to any foreign countries recently and I told her I'd been to Cuba back in December. She said that maybe I should also go and see an ifectious disease specialist. This has me very worried. My docotor doesn't seem to explain things as well as she should. I have read online that mono can cause acute viral hepatits and that with this specific form of hepatitis live enzyme levels cans shoot up substancially for a period of 1-2 months (over ten fold) before returning to normal. Is this a common occurence? Also, does one test positive for mono for the entire duration of the illness. I found out that although I tested positive for mono during my first blood test for some reason I tested negative on the second one. The only reason I know this was because I requested a copy of my blood tests sent to me after my last doctors appointment in case I wanted a second oppinion. My doctor didn't even mention the negative monospot test to me. Maybe you don't test positive for the full duration of the illness? Any insight you could give to me on my liver enzyme levels and their correlation with mono would be greatly appreciated as I am very worried here. Thanks very much!","Doctor":"Sorry, I should add that for the past 5 days or so I have been feeling much better.  I am no longer getting the fever and chills I was experiencing and feel like the mono is on the mend.  The main concern now is the liver enzyme levels.

If I nap during the day I never wake up in pain. The pain is like i m being stabbed but also stitch like. When i m in pain I find it difficult to take deep breaths, i m quite gassy and feel constipated although i m not. The last time I had it (which has been a lot recently) I had nausea and felt dizzy. Hot baths give me some relief and it feels like I need to put pressure on the area although this hurts. Stretching also gives relief for about a second. I usually end up pacing as I can t sit still. The pain usually lasts about 5 hours and then it will quite quickly subside enough so that I can go to sleep. When I wake up again the pain is gone. During the days I feel mildly sore in the area but will never have the stabbing pain. Also, the pain will either start with back ache or will start under my rib cage and then move to my back. Sometimes my whole back hurts, sometimes it s my upper back, sometimes my lower back. It s hard to describe the pain when i m not feeling it. i went to my doctors who said that he didn t know what it was but that it could be plurisy. I don t think it s plurisy.

You need to confirm if it is acute or long time infection by seeing if it is IgM or IgG HBcAb. If your Wife and Children are HBSAg negative then nothing to worry. Hepatitis B is spread by blood products, sexual intercourse. Your SGPT is normal. There are medicines like Interferon to cure you of the disease. If treatment is delayed then you can become a patient of chronic Hepatitis B and increased risk of Cirrhosis and Liver Cancer. Herbal products have proved efficacy in these diseases as proper studies have not demonstrated yet. I would recommend that you visit your Doctor and ask about Interferon therapy and Antiviral therapy to help you in this case. Use condom while having sexual intercourse."},{"Patient":"Hello I am 31 years old. my weight is 68 kg and height is 5 4 .

I have gone through your description. 60% blockages are considered non critical. The carotid arteries supply the brain. When you had a TIA a small clot may have been formed at the blockage area and later traveled towards your brain. So you need to be on anti platelet medications which will prevent the clot from forming. Endarterectomy is usually not done for 60% stenoses. In the future if the block increases in severity, a carotid stenting can be offered. Endarterectomy is a surgery and usually is done if angioplasty fails or is not possible. At present you need to be on medical management. Also the RCA has a 60%stenosis which again is non critical and should be managed on medications. You should be prescribed antiplatelet medications and statins which lower the cholesterol so as to prevent these cholesterol deposits in your arteries from increasing. You have many risk factors for heart disease like smoking, high BP, diabetes so you have to continue your BP and diabetic medications along with the above and try to quit smoking.

Awaiting your reply, thanking you in advance, Very Much","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for posting here. I have gone through your description. Lipitor can cause increase in the liver enzymes. Your liver enzymes are high but not very high to stop lipitor. I guess thats why your doctor has reduced the dose to 40 mg. If the liver enzymes SGOT and SGPT are greater than 3 times the normal range, they are stopped. These levels usually come down when stop therapy or reduce your lipitor dose. So in short, this is a reversible increase in the enzymes. Please continue lipitor at 40 mg and do a LFT after two weeks. If the levels continue to increase, then statin can be stopped for a period of four weeks. We must also consider the probability of fatty liver disease in this case, which can also cause increase in liver enzyme levels. Please do a sonography of the abdomen to rule out fatty liver disease.

(However the HBV DNA is not done in your case) Reactivation of HBV disease occurs when a person is in the inactive HBsAg carrier state and develops elevated liver enzyme and HBV DNA levels and, in some patients, detectable HBeAg if the wild type virus is the dominant infection. We would advice you to get the LFT evaluated and the antibodies of anti HBcAb and HBsAb done after 6 months. If the HBsAg is positive after 6 months then you might be going into chronicity which happens in only 10% cases. We would also suggest you to get your wife vaccinated (if married ) with Hep B vaccine if she is not yet exposed to. Further more you need your children to get vaccinated. Apart from this We would suggest you to take good nurtritious diet. We hope this informations would be useful for you in follow up. Please get back to us for futher queries or chat with our doctor from 9 to 9 IST daily. Regards"},{"Patient":"Dear Doc, I just got my LFT done.

After three days of this dose I decided to see a medical doctor . I was told that my liver enzymes were very high, and that I needed to stop taking the Depakote. How long will it take to get my liver back to normal ? Also, can I sue the doctor who put me on Depakote for malpractice ? The medical doctor didn t agree with me being on that medication for my disorder.","Doctor":"Dear Friend, I am sorry to hear about the unfortunate situation you were in because of Depakote related liver problems. Depakote is licensed to be used as a mood stabiliser ( mostly for patients suffering with mood disorders such as Bipolar affective diosrder). However a lot of practitioners do use this medicine in other disorders where there are mood swings or alterations. One such disorder is Borderline Personality disorder. Your first doctor was not wrong in prescribing this medicine as there are ample of research evidence to support it's use BUT he was wrong in not discussing about this with you beforehand - esp. because some insurance companies or medicare may not agree to pay for the prescription for off-license use - thus putting you at a risk of financial hardship. The elevated liver enzymes is a known side- effect of Depakote as it is metabolised by liver. Most prescribers do (& should) warn the patient about it and also do regular tests to look for same. They should also warn the patient against use of alcohol & other hepato-toxic medications - which again can put stress on pt's liver. If your doctor continued to prescribe and increase the dose of depakote when you were clearly having side effects plus had lab reports to show evidence of raised liver enzymes - he/she was clearly wrong. I must say that case however against the doctor ( if you plan to sue him/her) will be weak unless until you can show that there was evidence of raised liver enzymes but the prescription of depakote was kept same or dose increased. With regard to Borderline personality disorder - I will recommend that you engage with a psychotherapist or psychiatrist with experince in DBT ( Dialectical behaviour therapy).

How is a laparoscope used to remove the gallbladder? What are the benefits of this type of surgery? What are the complications?","Doctor":"The laparoscope is put into body through a tiny cut made just below navel. Surgeon can then see gallbladder on a TV screen and with tools inserted in 3 other small cuts made in the right upper part of abdomen. Gallbladder is then taken out through one of the incisions. With laparoscopic cholecystectomy, one can return to work more quickly, have less pain after surgery, have a shorter hospital stay, and have a shorter recovery time. Unlike traditional surgery, laparoscopic surgery to remove the gallbladder can be done without cutting the muscles of your abdomen. The incision is also much smaller. With laparoscopic cholecystectomy, patient can stay in the hospital overnight. With open cholecystectomy, one would need to stay in the hospital for about 5 days. Because the incisions are smaller with laparoscopic cholecystectomy, there isn't as much pain after this operation as after open holecystectomy. Complications are rare but may include bleeding, infection and injury to the tube that carries bile from gallbladder to stomach. During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the intestines or major blood vessels may be injured when the instruments are inserted into the abdomen."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, I am 54 years old Having high cholesterol(251) can i Take Omega 3 fatty acids but i had JAUNDICE IN 2008 but Right now is normal please can u suggest me should I take Omega 3 fatty acids for Reducing Cholesterol or not ?","Doctor":"you should take fenofibrate under the medical supervision of a doctor to reduce the cholesterol and not omega fatty acids, this will help you in bringing down the cholesterol and not the fatty acids, in three months my cholesterol levels were below 100"},{"Patient":"I would like to know something about obstructive jaundice.

Please explain What are the treatment and self care for the same?","Doctor":"Treatment for hepatitis includes bed rest, a balanced diet, and avoidance of alcohol and certain medications for at least 6 months. Hospitalization is only necessary for more serious cases, or for severe dehydration. With respect to Hepatitis B receiving an injection of hepatitis B immune globulin within 24 hours of coming in contact with the virus may help protect you from developing hepatitis B. Patients with chronic hepatitis B may need steroids or injections of interferon, an antiviral drug. Acute Hepatitis B can lead to Chronic Hepatitis in 10 to 15% of cases which can further lead to Cirrhosis too. Once you've developed chronic hepatitis B, few treatment options exist. In some cases especially if you don't have liver damage or clinically good your doctor may suggest monitoring by Liver Profiles rather than treating. In other cases, your doctor may recommend treatment with antiviral medications. When liver damage is severe, liver transplantation may be the only option. Self care includes bed rest until fever and jaundice are gone, and urine color is normal. Avoid too much physical activity in the first few months. Eat small, balanced meals, using lightly carbonated soft drinks, juices, and hard candy to reduce nausea. Do not drink alcohol. Do not engage in high risk behaviors, such as intravenous drug use or sex with multiple partners. If you have Hepatitis B, do not share food, drinks, toothbrushes, needles, or razor blades with others. Do not donate blood. The Hepatitis B vaccine can be an effective preventive measure in 90 - 95% of healthy people."},{"Patient":"I have a son who is 5 days old, I delivered recently. It was a normal delivery.

Initially liver inflammation prevents protein metabolism and people lose their appetite. If your appetite improves you should be able to eat normally and gradually be able to get to training."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, we had family trip about a month back and following that I had contact hepatitis A infection. How is hepatitis A infection caused? How is it treated?","Doctor":"Hepatitis A is spread by people with an active infection, even though they may not have symptoms. The virus commonly spreads from the stool of one person to the mouth of another. This can occur when an infected person uses the bathroom, does not wash his or her hands, and then handles food that others will eat. Or the virus can be waterborne, meaning it is picked up from contaminated water or by eating contaminated raw shellfish. The virus can also be spread through the saliva, blood, and other bodily fluids of a person with the infection, such as through anal sex. Hepatitis A is contagious for two to three weeks before symptoms appear, then for two to three weeks afterward. Treatment includes bed rest, a balanced diet, and avoidance of alcohol and certain medications that could affect the liver for at least 6 months. Hospitalization is only necessary for more serious cases, or for severe dehydration. Persons known to have been exposed to hepatitis A are recommended an injection of a substance called immune globulin, which can reduce the symptoms of hepatitis A. There is also a vaccine available that may provide years of protection against hepatitis A. The vaccine is usually given to people who will be traveling in areas where there is a high risk of contracting hepatitis A, or work in high risk areas, such as healthcare."},{"Patient":"Can viral hepatitis be detected by any pathological test once i am fully cured?","Doctor":"Viral hepatitis can be caused by any one of six identified hepatitis viruses ? they are A, B,C, D, E and G. All cause the liver to become inflamed, which interferes with its ability to function normally. All of these viruses cause Liver function test (LFT) abnormalities in the acute phase. These return to normal as the liver recovers and the time range is 2 weeks to 3 months normally. It may be more in the case of weaker/ aged individuals. Depending on which virus causes the hepatitis the blood test report will vary. Hepatitis A (causes acute viral hepatitis- Jaundice) is usually a self limiting disease which resolves without any medication. Diet and rest are the important parts of treating it. The antibody (HAV antibody) is not a routinely done test in India. If the antibody test is done, it can show a positive result for up to a period of about 6 months. The infections caused by Hepatitis B or C are more chronic and dangerous and tests are done to detect them. Certain antibody blood test will show up positive for these two viruses even post cure."},{"Patient":"Hi doc, I?m curious to know more about hepatitis c. What is hepatitis and hepatitis C? How can you get hepatitis C? How can I prevent passing on the virus to others? How is it treatment? Is there a vaccine for hepatitis C?","Doctor":"Hepatitis means inflammation of the liver. Several different viruses can infect the liver and cause hepatitis. One type of virus which causes hepatitis is called the hepatitis C virus. Hepatitis C is a blood-borne disease. The main source of infection is from blood from an infected person, using contaminated needles from the infected person, sharing toothbrushes, razors, and other such items which may be contaminated with blood or when using the equipment which is not sterile for tattooing, body piercing or infected mother can pass on the infection to her baby and also there is risk that an infected person can pass on the virus while having sex. The hepatitis C can be prevented by not sharing any needles, syringes, razors, tooth brushes and use condom when having sex. The main aim of treatment is to prevent severe liver damage leading to cirrhosis. Individuals with acute infection may require rest and avoid alcohol consumption. Individuals with chronic illness should be evaluated by a Gastroenterologist for treatment with anti viral medications such as Alpha-interferon. Liver transplant is done for patients who do not respond to medical treatment. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C."},{"Patient":"I woke up  feeling jittery.

What precautions do we need to take?","Doctor":"It depends upon the cause of jaundice. If it is hepatitis, avoid sternous activity, avoid rich foods and have good hand washing habits. Travelling may not be a good idea."},{"Patient":"Hello doc, my husband is 34 year old with hepatitis C. The physician has treating him has suggested liver transplant. Could u give me insight about the same and who is it indicated? What are its complications?","Doctor":"The best treatment for people with end-stage liver disease is liver transplantation. The donation of liver segments from living relatives, splitting one donated liver between two recipients, new organ allocation policies and, especially, new approaches to liver transplants for people with Hepatitis C virus. Until recently, Hepatitis C virus infected livers were routinely discarded. But recent studies have shown that people already infected with Hepatitis C virus who receive livers from Hepatitis C positive donors can do as well as if they had received a liver not infected with the virus. This may mean that many more livers will become available for a person with hepatitis C. Liver transplantation does not cure HCV. The majority of people with hepatitis C who receive liver transplants experience a recurrence of the virus. Those with HCV who receive liver transplants also are at accelerated risk of developing cirrhosis within five years. Treatment with HCV-fighting medications may help prevent a recurrence of infection or treat recurrent illness that develops after a liver transplant. However, the effectiveness of this type of treatment after a liver transplant is unclear. The complications of liver transplant are acute graft rejection, vascular thrombosis, biliary leak or stricture, and infection. These patients are also at increased risk of developing malignancy, which needs to be considered in the evaluation process. Adverse effects of immunosuppressant drugs also may complicate as well."},{"Patient":"Hi doc. What are the symptoms of jaundice? Can we make out for sure if we have jaundice? If we do have jaundice what should we do?","Doctor":"Jaundice is a sign caused by liver disease- it means is a yellowing of the skin, conjunctiva and mucous membranes caused by increased levels of bilirubin in the human body. Jaundice can be due to 1)Pre hepatic Jaundice-  excess break down of red blood cells- e.g. in malaria 2)Hepatic jaundice-  because of liver disease- can be viral, alcohol abuse or liver damage due to drugs/medicine, 3)Post hepatic Jaundice- due to obstruction to the out flow of bile- e.g. because of a gall stone causing obstruction. The symptoms of each of these types will be different. If you do notice that you have Jaundice you need to see a doctor for a physical examination to find out the cause for your jaundice.  If you have any further queries you can chat with our doctors online between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. Indian Standard time."},{"Patient":"My friend told me that I might have viral hepatitis. I am a 23 year old. What are the symptoms and what should I do now?","Doctor":"Fatigue, Nausea and vomiting, Abdominal pain or discomfort, especially in the area of your liver on your right side beneath your lower ribs, Loss of appetite, Low-grade fever, Dark urine, Muscle pain, Yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes(jaundice) are the most common symptoms. If you do have any of the above mentioned symptoms it is better for you to go to a doctor for a physical examination and get a few blood tests and a urine test done. The doctors will advice you on what tests are needed after a physical examination."},{"Patient":"I was suffering from jaundice last month. Then I recovered completely by taking medicines Livfit syrup and Udiliv 300. But lately I have started feeling so weak that I cannot even stand properly. How do I overcome it?","Doctor":"Jaundice is not a disease, but rather a symptom or a sign that can occur in many different diseases. It refers to the yellowish staining of the skin and the white part of the eyeball, caused by high levels of bilirubin in blood. Bilirubin comes from red blood cells (RBCs) - when RBCs get old, they are destroyed, and haemoglobin is released from the destroyed RBCs after the iron it contains is removed - the chemical that remains in the blood after the iron is removed becomes bilirubin. The liver usually removes bilirubin from the blood along with other waste products.  Jaundice can be of 3 types: ?  Pre-hepatic - increased bilirubin production which the liver in unable to remove from the blood, e.g. patients with haemolytic anaemia have an abnormally rapid rate of destruction of their red blood cells that releases large amounts of bilirubin into the blood ?  Hepatic - defect in the liver prevents bilirubin from being removed from the blood, the most common being viral hepatitis ?  Post-hepatic / Obstructive - blockage of bile ducts decrease the flow of bile and bilirubin from the liver into the intestines, which may be due to cancer, gallstones or inflammation of the bile ducts.  The treatment of jaundice usually requires a diagnosis of the specific cause of the jaundice and treatment directed at the specific cause.  I suggest you contact your doctor for a detailed history and physical examination, which are important for diagnosing the cause of jaundice. Bilirubin can also be measured in blood. Very high levels of unconjugated bilirubin relative to conjugated bilirubin suggest haemolysis (destruction of red blood cells). Very high levels of liver enzymes (aspartate amino transferase / AST and alanine amino transferase / ALT) suggest inflammation of the liver such as viral hepatitis. High alkaline phosphatase suggests disease or obstruction of the bile ducts.  Ultrasound examination of the abdomen or other imaging modalities may help to diagnose gallstones, tumours, dilated bile ducts due to obstruction, etc.  Weakness is a symptom associated with jaundice and takes time to settle down. Udiliv is the brand name of a medicine called ursodesoxycholic acid that is approved for use in certain specific gall bladder stones and chronic cholestatic liver disease due to gall bladder. Livfit is an Ayurvedic product and I would not like to comment on it."},{"Patient":"Hello...

I am having some problems with my health and no doctor can seem to figure it out. Back in November of 2015, I started awaking to a yellowish fluid in my bra. After about a week, I discovered that the fluid was coming from my right breast. I felt around my breast and discovered a small lump. I went to the doctor who, because of my age of 28, wrote it off as a fibroadenoma. I left it alone. I left the country for a few months, and in South Africa the leakage came back worse than before, so I went back again to the doctor. She had a ultrasound done and revealed that I not only had a Fribroadenoma, but also a Intraductal Papilloma, which would explain my leakage. That was back in March of this year. Over the months the lumps have gotten bigger, they hurt constantly, at least twice a day, and i feel three prominent new lumps that have developed beneath my right breast. I have not had a new ultrasound or mammogram done due to lack of funds. I have had blood work done within the last week and they all reveal nothing to be wrong.

Since you suffer from high blood pressure, some of the above symptoms like pounding heart, hot inside body can be due to high BP during those episodes. Feeling of tiredness, fatigue, listlessness can be caused by a number of factors. Going by your history and my experience, i consider the following probabilities here. First is vitamin D deficiency which can cause tiredness, fatigue. Get your vitamin D levels checked and if it's low, correct it by taking vitamin D supplements usually the once a week tablets. This will drastically reduce your symptoms in 2-3 weeks. next possibility is heart disease which can also lead similar symptoms. Don't worry, it's better to be safe than sorry. Since you have a high blood pressure history, and your age is 73, i advice you to undergo a cardiac check up which should include a ECG, 2D echo and a treadmill test. These tests are very sensitive to evaluate cardiac disease. So to summarise i would advice you to do a vit D levels, fasting and post lunch blood sugars, ECG, 2 D ECHO and treadmill test. wishing you good healthregards"},{"Patient":"Hi I have hard lumps on both rib cages and all test show nothing dr said inflammation may be hiding it it not soft like a limpoma very large and hard and make me tired and in pain now should I be worried and what Dr can I see I been to several and they have no clue what it is","Doctor":"Hi, Noted your short and specific history about hard and large lumps on both rib cages, makes you tired, and in pains, your Doctors have no clue as to what these are.Hence I would advise you the following:Consult an Orthopedic Surgeon for clinical examination.Insist for CT scan of the affected area and guided FNAC that is fine needle aspiration cytology.Also go for X-ray of pelvis and skull bones, these bones being flat.All these will surely lead to a proper diagnosis and then only a proper management is possible.Till then take an anti-inflammatory medications with painkiller properties for control of inflammation and pain.Hope I have answered your query.

And often get drowsy and mentally tired wen i involve to study. Wat is the reason??","Doctor":"Hi, You have migraine so definitely consult a neurologist for that. As far as the bony bumps are considered, you didn't mentioned what showed up on the CT and MRI scan, these can also be sebaceous cysts which are not dangerous at all and you can simply excise that. But definitely consult a neurologist, because as a doctor I need to examine your head along with your complete body to diagnose your condition. Hope I have answered your query.

The issue currently is a quarter size purplish/blue spot on her thumb with swelling, redness and pain. It started from a tiny white bump on her skin. She did not prick her skin at all prior to the tiny white bump appearing. This is her third strange infection on her fingers in less than 6 months.","Doctor":"Hello Thanks for posting here. As per your description it seems that she develops clots or emboli in the small arteries of the hand which leads to obstruction in blood supply and hence pain, swelling and redness. Sometimes vegetations (bacterial growths on valves) can lead to embolism or throwing away of clots from the heart to distant vessels, in this case arteries of her hand. Please do a 2 D echo to rule out these vegetations on the valves. Another important cause may be atherosclerosis of the hand arteries due to old age. Atherosclerosis causes the arteries to thin out leading to deficinecy of blood supply and the above symptoms. In that case a upper limb doppler is adviced but since it involves only the thumb or finger it is unlikely to be picked up by a doppler scan. I advice you to do a 2 D echo and start her on blood thinners like Ecosprin 75-150 mg. She should do well on that. If 2d echo does not show any vegetations, you can start her on tablet Trental 400 mg twice a day, which is a medication that increases the microcirculation. wishing her good healthRegards"},{"Patient":"Had a angiogram 4 days ago as a follow up for a brain aneurism a year ago.

I had hip surgery in August but BP was okay but recently spiked various time of the day and I am doing 4 readings since I had low sodium level but fine now. I am alarmed about the high BP i.e. 173/92 or 176/110. Yet other times it will 144/94 or 155/89. What causes this as I did not have issues when I was on Verapamil for several years. I was switched to amlodipine cause it did not affect my heart rate. I always had low heart rate but was told the new medication does not affect the heart rate. Advise why a spike in BP? I advised my doctor but haven t heard back yet","Doctor":"Hello Thanks for posting here. I have gone through your description. Your BP seems to be persistentlu higher despite taking amlodipine daily. Verapamil is a stronger blood control medication than amlodipine. But one of its effects is lowering the heart rate, which in your case was lowered too much hence stopped.. The amlodipine you are taking is not enough to control your BP and hence it must be changed. If you were my patient, I would start you on tablet Telma AM which is a combination of telmisartan plus amlodipine which would be an ideal combination for you. It does not lower the heart rate and has beneficial effects on the kidney and heart. The brand name telma AM may change from country to country, but telmisartan 40 mg plus amlodipine 5 mg combinations are available worldwide. You can take one tablet of Telma AM in the morning. It will definitely help get your pressure under control. If despite this your blood pressure remains high  (after two weeks of starting Telma AM) you must undergo a 24 hour ambulatory BP monitoring which records your BP every 15-20 mins while you go around your daily routine activities. It gives us an idea of your pressure control, effect of medications, time of day when pressure is high and also we can correlate high blood pressure with the activity you were doing at that time. So to proceed further, please take the telmisartan amlodipine combination i have adviced for two weeks and then follow up. Wishing you good health.

Just a hard oblong painful lump on the left side of my butt cheek near the anal canal.","Doctor":"Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns.At this area it may indicate several issues and most common are pilonidal cyst or perianal abscesses. These are inflammatory processes in sacral and perianal area usually manifested with pain, redness, swelling, fever and pus discharge. Cellulitis is less common and may be present in sacral area as well. This is mostly caused by beta hemolytic streptoccocus and it necessitates antibiotic treatment with augmentin, or combination of ciprinol+ metronidazole. You should also, apply cold compresses, take nonsteroid painkillers such as ibuprofen 400mg and rest. If there is no improvement within 2 days, you should see doctor and have intravenous antibiotics.Hope this answers your question.

Three weeks ago I noticed several changes. There was a change in size of the lump & the breast, the nipple is flattened and slightly inverted, there is dimpling on the lower breast, hardening around the nipple, dull pain in the breast and under the correlating arm, and a blistery rash between the breasts. I went to my physician and an MRI and mammogram were referred. They are scheduled for next week. This seems like a long wait especially when a biopsy may be required after screening. That could take another week or two. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hi Thanks for your query. Noted the history and understood the concerns. This is surely not normal. A lump in the breast with inverted nipple, hardness and all the changes are surely indicative of a cancer of the breast unless proved otherwise.When there is a wait the best way to get a referral for cancer surgeon and get at least FNAC of the lump so that you can get appropriate diagnosis and a plan of management. MRI and other investigations are to get a stage of the disease and thus changes plan according to the diagnosis thus made.If this turns out to be a benign lump still it is better to get an excision biopsy for two reasons:You get rid of the problems, lump is out and thus the disease is out.You get the confirmed diagnosis.Take Care Regards Dr. T Chandrakant, General Surgeon"},{"Patient":"I was bit by chiggers and believed there may be some that didn’t bite and are alive in my car that I live in so I went to the mountains over night and it got down to 20 degrees are they dead I left the windows down too.

However if there are additional symptoms such as fever, rapid growth of node, cough, weight loss or excessive swelling then this may be something pathological and require treatment. In these cases it is most commonly cause by some sort of infection.The most common cause of swollen lymph nodes is an infection, particularly a viral infection, such as the common cold. Other possible causes of swollen lymph nodes include:Strep throat, Measles, Ear infections, Infected (abscessed) tooth, Mononucleosis. Mononucelosis is commonest along the young people and this should be ruled out first. Then it can be treated with antibiotics or other medications depending on established cause. He should drink more fluids, take ibuprofeum and rest as much as possible till symptoms persist. In doubtful cases, lymph nide biopsy can be taken but I don’t think this is necessary at this point.Hope this answers your question.

Regular exercise can help you bring this heart rate down. It will also help in getting control over diabetes (not totally, you should be on medications also) and also help in decreasing your weight. If it is very high ( higher than 120) at rest, you can start taking tab coralan 5 mg twice a day which will help you bring the heart rate under control. Also since you have risk factors for heart disease (diabetes, overweight) please get a treadmill test done to rule out early heart disease. But above all regular exercise and diet control is of much help and is a must. wishing you good health. regards."},{"Patient":"I am 79 years old and in good health and active.

These are inflammatory processes in sacral and perianal area usually manifested with pain, redness, swelling, fever and pus discharge. Cellulitis is less common and may be present in sacral area as well. This is mostly caused by beta hemolytic streptoccocus and it necessitates antibiotic treatment with augmentin, or combination of ciprinol+ metronidazole. You should also, apply cold compresses, take nonsteroid painkillers such as ibuprofen 400mg and rest. If there is no improvement within 2 days, you should see doctor and have intravenous antibiotics.Hope this answers your question.

I still get a rapid heartbeat just doing simple regular things like going upstairs to do laundry or to climb out of bed or walking to mailbox or even after a bath is this normal","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for posting here. Donating blood causes a loss of blood volume of about 300 to 500 cc over 15 mins or so. The symptoms like passing out, tingling in limbs are not due to inadequate nutrition or so. It is due to vasovagal syncope which happens when the brain feels a loss of blood volume. It can happen in anyone. Again since the blood volume is low, the heart tried to compensate by increasing heart rate thereby increasing blood supply to other organs. That's why you have the fast heart rate. Soon, as you start drinking fluids, your body begins to absorb fluids into blood stream to increase the blood volume and heart rate comes back to normal. do there is nothing to worry about, just drink plenty of fluids and you will be fine. wishing you good healthRegards."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have 3 pea to marble sized hard lumps located in my hip flexor/groin region.

Sleep over 10 hrs.I think that an intense workout(relatively) every other day is the way to go.With blood pressure monitoring. Your thoughts? I am under care of a GP and Cardiologist.Bernard Gross age 82","Doctor":"Hello thanks for posting here. It is really a great determination from your side being 82, post heart surgery and willing to do intensive workout. But I dint feel there is any need of intensive workout.Working out with weights will not give any significant benefits to you. Most important in a post surgery patient is cardio exercises. Since you have an exercise bike at home you can put it to good use. A daily cycling for about 45 mins will be ideal. If you cannot do for 45 mins at one go, you can do 20 mins in the morning and 20 in the evening. Gradually your stamina will rise and you will be able to do 30 mins morning and 30 mins evening.  Regular workout on the exercise bike will increase your effort tolerance, burn out the extra calories and also help the body to utilize cholesterol, thereby decreasing the chances of reaccumulation of cholesterol on heart arteries. Regular cycling will also strengthen the leg muscles which will increase amount of blood coming back to the heart from the legs and will increase preload on the heart. This will help increasing the cardiac output also. It also helps to keep the heart rate under control. So in short cycling is an all inclusive exercise which is of great benefit. Brisk walking or walking on a treadmill daily is also beneficial. Other exercises are breath holding, deep breathing and breathing exercises which will increase oxygen delivery to the lungs and hence reduce heart workload. If you do the above, you would not need any other exercises and you will do very well and lead a symptom free life. wishing you good health.

I would recommend consulting with your attending physician for a careful physical exam and some tests: - a cardiac ultrasound - a chest X ray study- complete blood count for anemia- thyroid hormone levels for thyroid dysfunction- cortisol plasma levels for adrenal gland dysfunction- blood electrolytes for possible imbalance- liver and kidney function tests- fasting glucose and glucose tolerance test.

Are you taking any betablockers? They can cause chronic fatigue and low physical performance. But, I would also recommend consulting with your attending physician for a careful physical exam and some tests to investigate for other possible underlying causes: - a chest X ray study- an arterial blood gas analysis- complete blood count for anemia- thyroid hormone levels for thyroid dysfunction- blood electrolytes- kidney and liver function tests- blood electrolytes. If all these tests result normal, I would recommend performing a multi latency sleep test to investigate for possible sleep apnea.

However if there are additional symptoms such as fever, rapid growth of node, cough, weight loss or excessive swelling then this may be something pathological and require treatment. In these cases it is most commonly cause by some sort of infection.The most common cause of swollen lymph nodes is an infection, particularly a viral infection, such as the common cold. Other possible causes of swollen lymph nodes include:Strep throat, Measles, Ear infections, Infected (abscessed) tooth, Mononucleosis. Mononucelosis is commonest along the young people and this should be ruled out first. Then it can be treated with antibiotics or other medications depending on established cause. He should drink more fluids, take ibuprofeum and rest as much as possible till symptoms persist. In doubtful cases, lymph nide biopsy can be taken but I don’t think this is necessary at this point.Hope this answers your question.

Going by your description it looks like she has got arrhythmia. Arrythmias are disturbances in the heart rhythm which can cause such symptoms. When heart beats become fast and irregular or there is a short pause between beats, the brain does not receive blood supply for that moment. Thats why she gets the episodes like fainting or fit like episodes. The fast heart rate which she got later may be due to compensatory action of the heart after an arrythmia event. she has to get an ECG done which may show an arrythmia event. If not detected on ECG, then a 24 hour holter monitoring which records the ECG throughout for 24 hours when the patient is home should be done.Meanwhile a 2 D echo should be done to see whether there is any new onset cardiac event which is responsible for the same. The above symptoms can also occur due to narrowing of the heart valves which can be demonstrated by 2 D echo. wishing her good health. regards."},{"Patient":"I have a bulge on the left side of my pelivc near my groin.

I measured my heart rate after 15 minutes and it was up to 207. I then took my GTN spray and after about 10 - 15 minutes, it went down to 76. Should I see my doctor?","Doctor":"HelloThanks for posting here. You have definitely got a high heart rate which requires evaluation. Since you said you took GTN SPRAY i suppose you are suffering from heart disease. First of all it is necessary to determine what type of fast heart rate you have regular or irregular. Irregular fast heart rate is called AF or atrial fibrillation. Regular fast heart rate can be sinus tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia. All of the three entities require medical management. The decrease in heart rate with GTN spray is unusual and it may be just a incidental finding. GTN tends to increase the heart ratw, so next time refrain from taking GTN spray if you feel your heart rate is very fast. You must visit your doctor and get an ECG done. If the ECG does not detect any arrythmia of fast heart rate, then a 24 hour holter monitoring should br done which records the ECG for 24 hrs when the patient is doing his normal day to day activities. This will help detect the rhythm disturbances and treatment can be started accordingly. Since you have history of heart disease a 2 d echo should also be done to rule out organic cause of arrythmia.

Any help would be much appreciated","Doctor":"HiThanks for the query..As per your  explanation of symptoms and location of the swelling as you told that it is located right under the jaw shows that the lump is due to swelling in the sub mandibular salivary gland which is located just below the lower jaw..The swelling can be due to obstruction in the ducts of the salivary gland due to formation of crystalline stones in the ducts of the gland and they are formed from the minerals present in the saliva.It leads to back flow of saliva into the gland leading to swelling..It can also be due to formation of cysts or tumours into the glands.It can also be due to infection in the gland but an infection most commonly causes painful and tender swelling..If there is already any infection in any part of the mouth, face or any other body part and if the swelling is round and mobile can be mostly a lymph node swelling..YOU NEED NOT TO GET PANIC AS IT IS MOST COMMONLY A NON CANCEROUS SWELLING..I would suggest you to consult an Oral pathologist and get evaluated for the exact cause of the swelling and get treated..Obstruction in the ducts can be cleared by locating and removing the stones either by palpating and pushing the stone towards canal opening and in case of large stones a small incision placed inside mouth and stone is removed..Infections in gland or lymph nodes can be treated by antibiotics..Hope this helps..Regards.."},{"Patient":"My daughter has a lump a little larger than a quarter, underneath her chin, it is very tender, she says that it hurts a lot when touched.

I have been having chest pains about 4 wks. now.  I am an everyday smoker bout 1/2 pk a day.  Went to doctor last week (family physican) & they did an ekg, chest xray & blood work.  All of that was fine.  He referred me to a cardiologists in the event I went home & I had a heart attack.  That doctor was out of my network, so I didn't see him.  I have family history of coronary artery disease, primary cause factors being non-essential hypertension & smoking. Father had first heart attack @ 39, That's why I was so worried.  Long story short if possible, is that I havent had the pains since last Monday until last night.  I had gotten my temper up some, not in a raging shouting match or anything, but had a massive sharp pain in chest & it then went away.  The pain seems like it's behind my left breast bone.  When I was having the pains before, same thing sharp pain (not as bad as last night) but then I'd have a dull pain that lingered.  So, I guess my question is, should I really go see the cardiologist & have a stress test??  I'm worried.  I think it's stress related, but I really don't know how  normal those pains are??

I don't think this is heartburn related....","Doctor":"Hello Thanks for posting here. I have gone through your description. You have a strong family history of premature heart disease, smoking habit, overweight. Also you have said that you have suffered a heart attack. So what you are suffering is called post infarct angina. I suggest that you must immediately see a cardiologist; get a ECG , 2 D Echo done initally and then proceed for a stress test if 2 D echo is normal. Stress test is not indicated in a recent case of heart attack. Also you need to be started on blood thinners, anti angina medications, anti cholesterol medications. If your 2 d echo comes abnormal and suggests that you had suffered a heart attack, then you should undergo a coronary angiography which is a procedure to evaluate the arteries supplying blood to the heart. On basis of the angiography results you will be adviced further management in terms of medical management or angioplasty or bypass surgery. I dont want to scare you will all this, but please understand that it is necessary to get evaluated or you will have problems as you grow older.

Read the history and understood your concerns.Punching hard by the hand in frustration followed by an immediate swelling on the affected area can be due to wither of the following:Either contusion may be with rupture of vein or so can cause immediate swelling but this will not cause dysfunction or painful movements of the wrist or fingers.Another cause can be fracture and this necessarily will not allow proper function of the parts involved.This can be diagnosed or ruled out by 2 X-rays of the affected part in opposite views and if the fracture is present you have to have an opinion and further management by an Orthopedic Surgeon.If no fracture then elevation of the affected part above heart level, anti-inflammatory medications, pressure bandage without occlusion of arterial supply or return of venous drainage and icing can help you a lot.

I was in the bed for 1 week, just lying there because I had no energy. About 10 days after the diarrhea started, I was still very tired and still lying around. (I am usually up and about almost 14 of my 16 waking hours, run up the stairs, and am very active.) On the 10th day, I was talking on my cell phone for about 1 hour, when suddenly a saw a huge round ball form on my left arm (the one holding the phone), about the size of a small golf ball. I had not done anything to hit my arm, and had not been outside to get bitten by any bugs. While I watched over the next 5 minutes, the bulge on my arm proceeded to move toward my wrist, and form a bulge that was 5 inches long, 3 inches wide and about 1 inch high. I went to the pharmacy to purchase Benydryl, thinking it might be a bug bite, but the pharmacist told me to go to the emergency room. The doctor there said that it was a burst blood vessel, and it would form a bruise and go away. It did look like a lot of bruising over the next few days, but after two weeks now, the bulge is still there and is very tender. The bruising look has almost gone away. Perhaps my prolonged bed rest had something to do with it, or the extended time that I was using the cell phone. My GP has looked at it and said don t worry, it will go away, but I am concerned that I might have a blood clot that will travel out and cause a big problem! What do you think?","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to Healthcaremagic. Thank you for your query. In most cases this is just a swollen lymph node which doesnt require any specific treatment. Also, considering your description this may be some other  benign subcutaneous lesion such as lipoma, fibroma or atheroma and if there are no skin changes such as redness, pus discharge or pain and fever then you should not be worried since it can be easily surgically removed under local anesthesia.

A speedy response would be appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query.Noted the history and understood your concerns.Since you have undergone circumcision the protruding lump enlarging on erection can be due to enlarged vein that is connected to the blood spaces of penis and hence protruding on erection and getting smaller on flaccidity.Surely yes, it is better to get a confirmed diagnosis by a clinical evaluation , examination and if required color doppler studies of penis on erection to know the exact cause and thence only to worry about it. Also ask for medications like tryptomer that is amitriptyline to avoid the erection.Keep the area clean with local application of liquid povidone iodine.."},{"Patient":"My husband was in a motorcycle accident when an Suv ran a red light and hit him. He was knocked sideways off his bike, rolled 2 or 3 times and landed on his left side. In the ER he was Xrayed and they did a CT scan. His left inner pelvis is fractured, no other broken bones, but there is a lot of bruising and a large bulge on his outer left thigh. His pain is minimal, except when trying to stand or sit up but, using a walker, he's able to get back and forth to the bathroom, and walks around the house every few hours to keep exercising it like the Ortho Dr. told him to do. My question is; what do you think is causing the large bulge on his outer thigh?

She had water in her lungs. They also did an angiogram, and there are three blocked arteries. 98%,99%, 80%. (i think she also had a heart attack). They cannot do angioplasty stenting because of multiple blockages in places where arteries forks too. They had a meeting, and a surgeon is willing to do heart bypass surgery. Now she has had a stroke previously 12 years ago, which has left her with left sided weakness. They also say her heart is running at 27% rather than the normal 55%. Is heart bypass surgery safe for her to do? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello thanks for posting here. I have gone through your description. She has critical heart disease involving the three arteries if the heart. And since her pumping function has dropped to 27%, she definitely has had a heart attack. so once blocked arteries in the heart are diagnosed, there are two methods to open it. angioplasty and bypass surgery. As your doctor has adviced angioplasty cannot be done because of triple vessel disease and also involving the arteries where they bifurcate. So surgery is the only option in her. Surgery with a low pumping function is definitely riskier than one with a normal function. But here you have to assess the risk versus benefits. If you don't do the surgery then you are not treating the cause. Her quality of life will be poor, she will get tired easily and she stands the probability of having further heart attacks also which will further decrease the function. Going ahead with the surgery will improve quality of life, she can do her day to day activities, travel etc. however despite surgery pumping function will not increase more than 35%. But the risks of heart attacks is evaded. Another thing that should be considered is how mobile she is. As you said she has left sided weakness. If she is bed bound and requires help for her day to day activities, then a surgery would be more of a suffering to her. A CABG surgery has a good outcome and patients usually do well for 12-15 years. Now a days with advanced technologies and approaches, heart surgery risks have come down a lot. I personally have seen patients with 25-30% do well with CABG. So my advice is it will be worthwhile to take a call for CABG.

If it's due to a congenital abberation in the electrical conduction system of your heart. As you don't seem to have any complaints like dizziness, episodes of loss of consciousness, there is nothing to worry about. It is persistent because the electrical activity pathway is organised in such a way in your heart. However i would advice you to get a treadmill test which will show whether these extra beats increase with exercise or vanish during the exercise. If they vanish during exercise, they are the harmless extra beats. If they increase or come in groups during exercise then they can be troublesome. In that case, or if you got symptoms; an EP study can be done which involves identifying the abberant pathway and stimulating it to see whether it produces any life threatening arrythmias and ablating or burning the pathway if harmful. My view is you may probably not require the procedure. wishing you good healthregards"},{"Patient":"Hi, so I noticed that near my sternum on the left side of my chest right under my collarbone bulges  out just a little bit more than my right side.

Do I need to see doctor because I'm not sure I want to go there and explain this situation unless it is a must.","Doctor":"Hi there,The most common cause of having bumps that are painful after injecting anything is an infection. Sometimes, this is self limiting and will resolve, and other times this will need treatment with antibiotics and possibly even a drainage if it forms an abscess.  The symptoms of puffiness, redness, pain, and feeling that you want to gouge them out is classic of an abscess (think of this as a very large pimple under your skin).I would do warm compresses to the affected area, as warm as you can stand it for as long as you can. I'd say 20 minutes with very warm compress, off for 10 minutes, then on again.  This may cause the bumps to start to drain pus, which is a good thing. If they continue to enlarge and be painful, you'll likely need to see a doctor for some antibiotics, and possibly even an incision and drainage procedure, where the doctor takes a knife and opens them up.  I'd start with the warm compresses and see how you do. The fact that you're having fevers is worrisome that the infection may be in your blood and causing problems.  If you continue to have fevers, chills, or any other symptoms that persist, I would definitely see a doctor and have them check blood cultures.I would also get checked for HIV, Hepatitis B and C, and if you do have bacteria in blood that persists, you need to have an ultrasound of the valves in your heart, as sometimes the bacteria from injecting can travel to those valves and cause damage. This usually requires treatment with a long course of antibiotics, and can cause continuing problems if not treated.I wouldn't beat yourself up for shooting meth.  We all struggle with addictive problems. Some people use drugs, some people overeat, and some take it out on their loved ones.  Those who judge you are simply hiding their own problems or are in denial.  I would ask you to remember there are people who love you, and even though I have never met you or talked to you in person, I feel for you and I understand what you are going through. You are still a valuable person, and please don't ever feel down about yourself.  I hope this is helpful. Please feel free to reach out to me if you need help in anyway, even if it is non-medical."},{"Patient":"I had a cortisone injection in my thumb joint (at the wrist) and two days later developed a large and tender lump on the inside of my elbow.  It is painful and has not gone down in four days - even with heat.  Could this be a lymphatic reaction to the shot?  If so, what do I do other than hot compresses?a","Doctor":"Hi there, There are a few possibilities here. One cause is a hematoma (blood underneath the skin) that may have traveled down from the injection site to your elbow joint. This is probably less likely, as you'd notice bruising down your entire forearm.Another possibility is an infection that travels down the area of injection to the joint space. This would be accompanied by redness, heat, and worsening pain, as well as fevers and chills.  Finally, the last thing that is possible is an allergic reaction, although this is also unlikely as cortisone is a naturally occurring hormone in the body. A third possibility is swelling causing nerve compression and pain.  For my clinic patients, I usually recommend warm compresses which you have been doing. I recommend a 15 minute on/15 minute off interval at the minimum, but you can increase the interval on time. Ibuprofen will be helpful here, and as long as you don't have a history of stomach ulcers or kidney problems, you can take 800mg every 8 hours as needed. You can also try some benadryl, which may help as well with swelling. I'd try doing those two things. If your pain doesn't get better or your symptoms worsen, then I'd follow up with the doctor who gave you the injection. if you start having fevers, chills,  nausea, or vomiting, then go to seek medical attention sooner.

I would keep your son's leg elevated, ice him with 15 minutes of ice on, 15 minutes off, and have him rest the leg. Motrin is fine for pain and it may also help with swelling.

It is a quick and non-invasive test. I'd give it about a week and if it hasn't gotten better, you can see your primary care doctor or an urgent care doctor who can order an ultrasound for you.

What should I do?  I guess he's afraid it may be cancer.  He did have a lump removed about 15 yrs ago on the right hand side up higher it was benign.","Doctor":"Hi there,I would have your husband undergo an ultrasound. In most cases, masses that are painful are NOT associated with cancer. It sounds like a painful mass would be consistent with something more like an abscess.  An ultrasound is a quick and non-invasive test that can be done as an outpatient. I would reassure him and try to encourage him to get an ultrasound. I hope this is helpful. Feel free to contact me if you have any further questions."},{"Patient":"I have a painful lump under my skin next to my shin. It got smaller when it was massaged, but then it came back to its normal size. It has been there for a couple months. It feels more fleshy than a muscle knot. What type of doctor should i see to address this?","Doctor":"The first thing I would do is get an ultrasound of the area in question. You can get the through your primary care physician.  If it feels fleshy, odds are it is a lipoma, and a general surgeon can remove it quite easily.  If you take your ultrasound report to him/her, he can probably set you up for removal quite easily."},{"Patient":"My name is Ken Karson, I am an inner city hospital which is often the sight of emergency treatment for IV users.

Given your history and symptoms, you have high probability of infective endocarditis. It is a disease of the heart valves. IV users are most likely to get right sided infective endocarditis of heart valves because of unsterile methods by which bacteria gain direct access to the heart endocardium. And also please get your HIV HbsAg and HCV checked which are transmitted by blood, given your history of iv use. To evaluate infectious endocarditis, you must do a blood culture which is a blood test and a 2 D echo which will demonstrate bacterial growth on the valves of the heart. take care.Regards."},{"Patient":"31 yr old male. Wrestler and jiu jitsu practitioner. Never had any significant health problems. I found a quarter sized lump on my inner thigh a couple inches south of my groin. It is firm, painless, slightly purple with a black dot on the top. You can move it under the skin. I've attempted to puncture it with a needle and squeezed it pretty hard to see if pus would come out. Only blood. I now have some fluid build up around the lump (what I get for being a DIY doctor, right?) It hasn't gotten any bigger. I started doing jiu jitsu again about 4 days a week for the last month. Only after I started jiu jitsu did this lump come up. Any ideas what it could be?","Doctor":"Hi there - Lump on the thigh could be a number of things.  Given your history of Jiu Jitsu and wrestling, the most common thing is a hematoma (old blood clot) under the skin.  Another cause could be a lipoma (basically, a benign fat ball).  Neither of these is cause for concern. Another more concerning cause could be an enlarged lymph node, which can be caused by a benign infection and in rare cases, malignancy (cancer). I certainly don't mean to scare you, and the other causes I mentioned are much, much more likely. I'd recommend you not stick any more needles in it for starters, and ask your doctor for an ultrasound. If there's any question, they can biopsy the mass and find out what it is.Hope this is helpful, feel free to contact me if you have any further questions."},{"Patient":"I woke up this morning with a knot/lump the size of a quarter on the inside of my bicep near the elbow. approximately an inch down from elbow crease. its sore but no irritation on skin or redness.

However it is a gradual process and going by your age it seems unlikely that you have clogged arteries.

My wife had a stress test recently because her family doctor just purchased stress test equipment(note: she has had no symptoms of heart problems but has diabetes). She was the 4th person to have the test on this equipment. According to the results stress images reveal a large sized perfusion abnormality of moderate to severe intensity in the lateral and anterolateral walls . Stress images also showed a medium sized perfusion abnormality of mild to moderate intensity in the interoseptal and inferiolateral walls. Grade V stage. Gated SPECT revealed abnormal left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 36%. There was severe hypokinesis in the inferior, lateral, anterolateral, and inferolateral walls of the left ventricle. There is diminished systolic wall thickening in these regions as well. Images would appear to show that heart is not functioning while under stress. Family doctor and specialist are recommending Standard Angiogram. Wife and I have doubts about the validity of the test because she was the 4th patient to have it(at least 1 other patient had an abnormal reading). Also there is a percentage of false positives in females. When we suggested a CTA doctors balked saying that she would still need a Standard Angiogram. Are we wrong in wanting the CTA first(we would pay entire cost of test) then if indicated have the Standard Angiogram. Thank you for reading and hopefully replying.","Doctor":"Hellothanks for posting here.  I have gone through the findings of the stress imaging. It is a very sensitive test for diagnosing coronary artery disease. By the reports of her stress imaging it appears she has multiple areas of blood supply insufficiency. It is a quite sensitive test and there is no reason to suspect report or images may not be accurate because it is new. Also a faulty machine would not show so many deficiencies. So she definitely has significant coronary artery disease which is indicated by multiple areas of perdusion abnormality with decrease in contractile function to 36% and akinesia/hypokinesia. Do she should undergo a conventional angiogram and not a CTA. CTA has more of a role in patients in whom diagnostic tests are negative, but the patient has heart related complaints. So basically it is to rule out coronary artery disease in patients who are less likely to have coronary artery disease. In her case, since there is a steong suspicion of coronary artery disease, conventional angio must be done. Also CTA is not very good in quantifying the severity of a block. Also even if she undergoes a CTA, and some blocks are diagnosed (which will come up in her case), the next step would be a conventional angiogram. So the ideal way to proceed from here is a conventional angiogram and definitely not a CTA. wishing her good health.regards"},{"Patient":"Hi I have a swollen lump under my right collar bone, I believe it s my right lymphatic duct.

ECG is a test that records the electrical activity in the heart. It can give us a lot of information about heart conduction disturbances, disturbances in heart rhythm, heart attack etc. however it has its shortcomings also. EKG may show variabilities from normal in person to person hence some changes may be present which are termed as non specific changes. Your doctor must have asked you to repeat EKG because he has found some non specific changes. Also an EKG may be normal when there is no chest pain or associated complaints. Do in order to go ahead and determine whether you have a heart disease, please get a treadmill test done which will show if there are any blockages in the heart. Treadmill test has a good sensitivity of about 70%, that means it will diagnose 70% of patients with significant heart blockages. If treadmill test comes positive then you must get worked up further for heart disease. I usually advice all my patients above 40 to undergo a TMT annually. wishing you good healthRegards"},{"Patient":"I had a breast biopsy this week for a tiny lump.

The Cardiologist remarks \\"At least it wasn't in the \\"Widow-maker\\". 1:  List 4 possible sites of blockage.","Doctor":"hellothanks for posting here. myocardial infarction or heart attack is an acute condition where one of the arteries supplying blood to the heart gets completely blocked resulting in deficiency of blood supply to that part of the heart. therefore that part of the heart starts dying and the contracting function of the heart suffers. Great blockages occur as a result of cholesterol deposits in the arteries of the heart. so this cholesterol deposition happens in everyone. but there are also risk factors for developing heart blockages. A strong family history of heart disease can lead to increased deposition of cholesterol deposits and premature heart disease. other risk factors are old age, smoking history, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, sedentary life style, male sex, improper diet etc. These all factors lead to increased cholesterol deposition in the arteries which become narrow. As a result when such a person exercises or runs, the blood supply to the heart reduces and hence painter gets chest pain. This is called angina. sometimes when the arteries become very narrow, the blood flow decreases and becomes slow leading to formation of class and total blockage of the blood supply. this is called myocardial infarction. so an angina attack can go away with rest since blood flow is less but not absent, but myocardial infarction doesnt resolve with rest. It requires prompt opening of the artery with either clot buster medications or with interventional procedures. the widow artery is the LAD which supplies almost 60% of the heart muscle and most often is fatal, hence called widow artery. Treatment of myocardial infarction is clot buster medications, blood thinners, international procedures like primary angioplasty, bypass surgery in some cases, blood thinner medications, anticholesterol medications, anti angina medications and drugs which help maintain heart shape and size after a heart attack. ( prevent remodeling of the heart) ."},{"Patient":"Just discovered lump on left side of neck blow jaw line.

Any advice?","Doctor":"Hellothanks for posting here. you seem to have got resistant hypertension brcause your BP is not under control despite being om medications. So we must llok out if there are any treatable causes of this resistant high blood pressure. A block in both the arteries supplying the kidneys is on the causes of resistant hypertension. So please do a renal artery doppler to see whether you have kidney artery disease.Another reason is a condition Called pheochromocytoma. It is a bening tumour of the adrenal glands (located above the kidneys). To detect that a CT abdomen can be done. so my advice is first to do a renal artery doppler and if it is normal then a CT abdomen. Meanwhile your BP medications should be added and changed. wishing you good healthregards"},{"Patient":"Sometimes when I bend over there seems to be a painful lump internally under left ribcage.
