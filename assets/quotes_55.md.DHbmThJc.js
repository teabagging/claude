We need to find the sum of the products of all non-empty subsets of ( M(n) ).2. Base case:   For ( n = 1 ), the only non-empty subset is ({-1}), and its product is (-1). Therefore, ( S(1) = -1 ).3. Inductive step:   Assume ( S(k) = -1 ) for some ( k geq 1 ). We need to show that ( S(k+1) = -1 ).4. Consider ( M(k+1) = {-1, -2, ldots, -(k+1)} ):   The sum of the products of all non-empty subsets of ( M(k+1) ) can be divided into two parts:   - The sum of the products of all non-empty subsets of ( M(k) ).   - The sum of the products of all subsets of ( M(k) ) each multiplied by (-(k+1)).5. Sum of products of all non-empty subsets of ( M(k) ):   By the inductive hypothesis, this sum is ( S(k) = -1 ).6. Sum of products of all subsets of ( M(k) ) each multiplied by (-(k+1)):   Each subset of ( M(k) ) can either include or exclude (-(k+1)). If it includes (-(k+1)), the product of the subset is the product of the subset without (-(k+1)) multiplied by (-(k+1)).   Therefore, the sum of the products of all subsets of ( M(k) ) each multiplied by (-(k+1)) is:   [   -(k+1) cdot left( sum_{text{subsets of } M(k)} text{product of elements} right)   ]7. Sum of products of all subsets of ( M(k) ):   The sum of the products of all subsets of ( M(k) ) is ( S(k) + 1 ) because we need to include the empty subset (which has a product of 1).8. Combining the results:   [   S(k+1) = S(k) + left( -(k+1) cdot (S(k) + 1) right)   ]   Substituting ( S(k) = -1 ):   [   S(k+1) = -1 + left( -(k+1) cdot (-1 + 1) right) = -1 + 0 = -1   ]9.

Symmetry of the function:   Substitute ( x ) with ( 1 - x ) in Equation 1:   [   f(f(1-x)f(x)) = f(1-x)   ]   Since ( f(1-x) = f(x) ) (as shown in the solution), we have:   [   f(f(x)f(1-x)) = f(x)   ]   This confirms that ( f(1-x) = f(x) ), indicating that ( f ) is symmetric about ( x = frac{1}{2} ).4.

From this, it follows that sin x = cos x, i.e., x = frac{pi}{4} + k pi, k in mathbb{Z}, but due to the condition sin x, cos x geqslant 0, only x = frac{pi}{4} + 2 k pi, k in mathbb{Z} remains.Now assume sqrt{sin x} - sqrt{cos x} neq 0. Then, by canceling out the common factor, the equation reduces to sqrt{sin x} + sqrt{cos x} = 1. Let a = sqrt{sin x} and b = sqrt{cos x}. Then we have a + b = 1, where the numbers a and b satisfy 0 < a, b leq 1. Squaring both sides, we get a^2 + b^2 + 2ab = 1. Since a^2 + b^2 = sin x + cos x leq sqrt{2}, and 2ab = 2sqrt{sin x cos x} leq 1, we have a^2 + b^2 + 2ab leq sqrt{2} + 1, which is a contradiction because a^2 + b^2 + 2ab = 1.Therefore, the final solutions are only those obtained in the first case, i.e., x = frac{pi}{4} + 2 k pi for k in mathbb{Z}."},{"problem":"Solve the equation frac{2003 x}{2004}=2003^{log _{x} 2004}.","solution":"Solution.

We will solve this equation.If any of u, v, or w is zero, then by (1) their sum is also zero, and we obtain the solution u = v = w = 0. Therefore, we can assume that all three values are at least 1.The left-hand side of (1) can be further transformed:(u v - 1)(w - 1) + (u - 1)(v - 1) - 2 = 0If all three values are at least 2, then u v geq 4, and thus (u v - 1)(w - 1) geq 3. Adding the non-negative term (u - 1)(v - 1) cannot result in 2. Therefore, one of u, v, or w must be less than 2, and since all three values are at least 1, one of them, say w, must be exactly 1. Then (2) becomes:(u - 1)(v - 1) = 2The values of the factors are non-negative, so the product is exactly 2 if one factor is 1 and the other is 2. Therefore, the set {u, v} is equal to the set {2, 3}, and the non-negative solutions of (1) are {0, 0, 0} and {1, 2, 3}. Thus, the solutions of the original equation are either {x, y, z} = {1, 1, 1} or {x, y, z} = {2, 3, 4}.Therefore, the equation has 7 solutions in the positive integers: x_1 = y_1 = z_1 = 1, and the six permutations of the triplet {2, 3, 4}.Remarks. 1. A similar calculation can easily verify that a triplet (x, y, z) is a solution to the original equation if and only if the triplet (x_1 = 2 - x, y_1 = 2 - y, z_1 = 2 - z) is also a solution. Since the equation clearly has no solutions in negative integers (as x y, y z, z x, and -x y z are all at least 1), the equation cannot have solutions where all three values are greater than 2.Among the positive solutions, there must be a value less than 3. If a positive solution contains the value 2, for example, x = 2, then x_1 = 0, y_1 = 2 - y, and z_1 = 2 - z is also a solution, which means y_1 z_1 = 2. This implies either {y_1, z_1} = {1, 2} and thus {y, z} = {-1, 0}, which is not a positive solution, or {y_1, z_1} = {-1, -2} and thus {y, z} = {3, 4}; we obtain the triplet {2, 3, 4}.We have not yet found the positive solutions where 2 is not an element. The smallest element of such solutions is 1. If, for example, x = 1 leq y, z, then the equation takes the formy + z = 2which can only be satisfied by positive integers y and z if y = z = 1.2. The equation can be solved for y as a rational function of x with parameter z:y = frac{z x - 2}{(z - 1) x - z}If we handle the case where any of the variables is 1 as described in the first remark, then the function (3) should be analyzed when x, y, and z geq 2, and since x = y = z = 2 is not a solution, it can be assumed that z > 2.We need to find lattice points on the graph of the function in the quadrant where x geq 2 and y geq 2, provided that the integer value of the parameter z is greater than 2.The graph of the function is symmetric about the line y = x, and is shown in the figure. The asymptotes of the hyperbola are the lines x = z_0 and y = z_0, where z_0 = frac{z}{z-1}. Since z > 2, it follows that 1 < z_0 < 2.

Show that ( s(n) ) is an integer whenever ( n ) is an integer.   We start with the given function:   [   s(n) = frac{1}{6} n^3 - frac{1}{2} n^2 + frac{1}{3} n   ]   Factor out ( n ):   [   s(n) = n left( frac{1}{6} n^2 - frac{1}{2} n + frac{1}{3} right)   ]   Combine the terms inside the parentheses:   [   s(n) = frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}   ]   To show that ( s(n) ) is an integer for any integer ( n ), we need to show that ( frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} ) is an integer. Notice that ( n(n-1)(n-2) ) is the product of three consecutive integers, which means it is always divisible by ( 6 ) (since among any three consecutive integers, one is divisible by ( 2 ) and one is divisible by ( 3 )). Therefore, ( frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} ) is an integer.2. Determine how many integers ( n ) with ( 0 < n le 2008 ) are such that ( s(n) ) is divisible by ( 4 ).   We need ( s(n) = frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} ) to be divisible by ( 4 ). This means ( n(n-1)(n-2) ) must be divisible by ( 24 ) (since ( 6 times 4 = 24 )).   We split it into cases based on the properties of ( n ):   Case 1: ( n ) and ( n-2 ) are even.   For ( n ) and ( n-2 ) to be even, ( n ) must be even. Among any two consecutive even numbers, one is divisible by ( 4 ). Therefore, ( n(n-1)(n-2) ) will be divisible by ( 8 times 3 = 24 ).   The number of even integers ( n ) in the range ( 0 < n le 2008 ) is:   [   leftlfloor frac{2008}{2} rightrfloor = 1004   ]   Case 2: ( n-1 ) is even.   For ( n-1 ) to be even, ( n ) must be odd. Additionally, ( n-1 equiv 0 pmod{8} ) implies ( n equiv 1 pmod{8} ). The number of such ( n ) in the range ( 0 < n le 2008 ) is:   [   1 + 8k le 2008 implies k le 250 implies k = 0, 1, 2, ldots, 250   ]   This gives us ( 251 ) such numbers.3.

Express your answer as a  b^c + d  e^f for integers a, b, c, d, e, and f with a nmid b and d nmid e.","solution":"1. We need to find the number of permutations ((a_1, a_2, cdots, a_{2007})) of the integers from (1) to (2007) such that there is exactly one (i) between (1) and (2006) for which (a_i > a_{i+1}). This means there is exactly one descent in the permutation.2. Consider the general case for (n) integers. We need to count the number of permutations of ({1, 2, ldots, n}) with exactly one descent. A descent occurs when (a_i > a_{i+1}).3. Each valid permutation can be split into two increasing subsequences. For example, if the permutation is ((a_1, a_2, ldots, a_i, a_{i+1}, ldots, a_n)) with (a_i > a_{i+1}), then ((a_1, a_2, ldots, a_i)) and ((a_{i+1}, ldots, a_n)) are both increasing subsequences.4. To count the number of such permutations, we need to choose a subset (S) of ({1, 2, ldots, n}) to be the first block. The first block must be increasing, and the second block must also be increasing. The maximum element of the first block must be greater than the minimum element of the second block to ensure a descent.5. The number of ways to choose a subset (S) of ({1, 2, ldots, n}) is (2^n). However, not all subsets (S) are valid. Specifically, the subsets where the maximum element of the first block is less than the minimum element of the second block are invalid. These invalid subsets are ({1}, {1, 2}, ldots, {1, 2, ldots, n}), which are (n+1) subsets.6. Therefore, the number of valid subsets (S) is (2^n - (n + 1)).7. For (n = 2007), the number of valid permutations is:   [   2^{2007} - 2008   ]8. We need to express this in the form (a cdot b^c + d cdot e^f) with (a nmid b) and (d nmid e).

We claim that if (mathrm{X}) is a point of one of these arcs other than its endpoints, then the only possible segment length 3 with an endpoint at (X) (and the other endpoint on the surface of the cube) is AX. wlog we can consider (X) to be on the arc BC. Take axes with origin O, so that A is ((0,0,2)). Suppose (X) is ((a, b, 0)) and that the other endpoint of the segment is (Y(x, y, z)). Then (X Y^{2}=(x-a)^{2}+(y-b)^{2}) (+z^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}+z^{2}-x(2 a-x)-y(2 b-y)=5+z^{2}-x(2 a-x)-y(2 b-y)). But (a, b>1) since (X) is not an endpoint of the arc, so (2a-x) and (2b-y) are both positive. Hence (-x(2 a-x)-y(2 b-y) leq 0) with equality iff (x=y=0). Similarly, (z^{2} leq 4) with equality iff (z=2). Hence (X Y^{2} leq 9) with equality iff (mathrm{Y}=mathrm{A}), which proves the claim.Thus if the next link of the polygonal line goes from A to anywhere except B, C, D, then it has to go back to A. So a minimal line must go to B, C, or D.Now from (mathrm{D}) the line can only go to (mathrm{A}) or (mathrm{O}). For if it goes to (mathrm{Z}(mathrm{x}, mathrm{y}, mathrm{Z})), then we have (mathrm{DZ}^{2}=(mathrm{x}-) (2)^{2}+(y-2)^{2}+(z-1)^{2} leq 2^{2}+2^{2}+1^{2}=3^{2}) with equality iff (x=0, y=0) and (z=0) or 2 .So let us take A as the starting point of the polygonal line. wlog the first segment is AD. Then the second segment must be DO (for a minimal line). Thus the best we can do with 2 segments is to move along an edge. It takes three such moves to get to the opposite corner, and hence at least 6 segments. But it is obvious that it can be done with 6 segments."},{"problem":"Given (C:{{x}^{2}}+{{y}^{2}}-2x-4y-4=0) intersects the (x)-axis at (A({x}_{1},0),B({x}_{2},0) ), and intersects the (y)-axis at (C(0,{y}_{1}),D(0,{y}_{2}) ), then among the following statements, the incorrect one is (()    ())A: ({{x}_{1}}+{{x}_{2}}=-2)B: (|{{x}_{1}}-{{x}_{2}}|=2sqrt{5})C: ({{y}_{1}}+{{y}_{2}}=4)D: ({{x}_{1}}{{x}_{2}}={{y}_{1}}{{y}_{2}})","solution":"AnalysisThis question examines the general equation of a circle and the relationship between the intersection points of the circle with lines and the system of equations, which is a basic question.

As the coefficient of ( x^i ) is multiplied by ( a^i ) in ( f(ax) ), either ( a^i equiv 1 ) or the ( x^i )-coefficient of ( f ) should be zero.

Given the six-digit number (123abc) is a multiple of (990), we need to find (a + b + c). 2. Since (990 = 2 times 3^2 times 5 times 11), the number (123abc) must be divisible by (2), (9), and (11).3. For (123abc) to be divisible by (2), the units digit (c) must be (0). Therefore, (c = 0).4. Now, the number (123ab0) must be divisible by (9). A number is divisible by (9) if the sum of its digits is divisible by (9). Thus, we have:   [   1 + 2 + 3 + a + b + 0 equiv 6 + a + b equiv 0 pmod{9}   ]   This simplifies to:   [   a + b equiv 3 pmod{9}   ]5. Next, the number (123ab0) must be divisible by (11). A number is divisible by (11) if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by (11). Thus, we have:   [   (1 - 2 + 3 - a + b - 0) equiv 1 + 3 + b - 2 - a equiv 2 + b - a equiv 0 pmod{11}   ]   This simplifies to:   [   b - a equiv 9 pmod{11}   ]6. We now have two congruences:   [   a + b equiv 3 pmod{9}   ]   [   b - a equiv 9 pmod{11}   ]7. Solving these congruences, we start with (b - a equiv 9 pmod{11}). This can be written as:   [   b = a + 9   ]8. Substitute (b = a + 9) into (a + b equiv 3 pmod{9}):   [   a + (a + 9) equiv 3 pmod{9}   ]   [   2a + 9 equiv 3 pmod{9}   ]   [   2a equiv 3 - 9 pmod{9}   ]   [   2a equiv -6 pmod{9}   ]   [   2a equiv 3 pmod{9}   ]9. To solve (2a equiv 3 pmod{9}), we find the multiplicative inverse of (2) modulo (9). The inverse of (2) modulo (9) is (5) because (2 times 5 equiv 1 pmod{9}). Thus:   [   a equiv 3 times 5 pmod{9}   ]   [   a equiv 15 pmod{9}   ]   [   a equiv 6 pmod{9}   ]10. Therefore, (a = 6). Substituting (a = 6) back into (b = a + 9):    [    b = 6 + 9 = 15    ]11. Since (b) must be a single digit, we need to re-evaluate our steps. We should check for other possible values of (a) and (b) that satisfy both congruences. 12. Re-evaluating, we find that (a = 7) and (b = 5) satisfy both conditions:    [    a + b = 7 + 5 = 12 equiv 3 pmod{9}    ]    [    b - a = 5 - 7 = -2 equiv 9 pmod{11}    ]13. Therefore, (a = 7), (b = 5), and (c = 0).14. The sum (a + b + c = 7 + 5 + 0 = 12).The final answer is (boxed{12})."},{"problem":"N6.

Analyzing the polynomial: Since ( P ) has integer coefficients, we can use properties of polynomials and integer sequences to derive constraints on ( a_i ).3. Difference of consecutive terms: Consider the difference ( a_i - a_{i-1} ). Since ( P(a_i) = i ) and ( P(a_{i-1}) = i-1 ), we have:   [   P(a_i) - P(a_{i-1}) = i - (i-1) = 1   ]   By the properties of polynomials, ( a_i - a_{i-1} ) must divide ( P(a_i) - P(a_{i-1}) ). Therefore:   [   a_i - a_{i-1} mid 1   ]   This implies:   [   a_i - a_{i-1} in {1, -1}   ]4. Sequence construction: Since ( a_i neq a_j ) for ( i neq j ), the sequence ( a_i ) must be strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. Without loss of generality, assume ( a_i ) is strictly increasing. Thus:   [   a_{i+1} = a_i + 1   ]5. Polynomial construction: To construct such a polynomial ( P ), consider:   [   P(x) = x + prod_{j=1}^{2022} (x - j)   ]   This polynomial has degree 2022 and satisfies ( P(j) = j ) for ( j = 1, 2, ldots, 2022 ).6. Proof of optimality: Suppose there exists a polynomial ( P ) of degree 2022 that satisfies ( P(a_i) = i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n ) with ( n > 2022 ). Then ( P(x) - x ) would have more than 2022 roots, which contradicts the fact that a polynomial of degree 2022 can have at most 2022 roots. Therefore, the maximum ( n ) is 2022.7.

(Beatrice and Hieu are at the same place at a given time if they start at the same time or finish at the same time, or are at the same place at some point between the beginning and end of the path at the same time.)(ii) One day, Beatrice uses a scooter and travels from the beginning of the path to the end of the path at a constant speed of x mathrm{~km} / mathrm{h}, where x>5 and x<15. Hieu still cycles from the beginning of the path to the end of the path at a constant speed of 15 mathrm{~km} / mathrm{h}. If the probability that there is a time at which Beatrice and Hieu are at the same place on the path is frac{13}{200}, determine the range of possible values of x.","solution":"Since 10 minutes is frac{1}{6} of an hour, when Beatrice walks at 5 mathrm{~km} / mathrm{h} for 10 minutes, she walk a distance of 5 mathrm{~km} / mathrm{h} times frac{1}{6} mathrm{~h}=frac{5}{6} mathrm{~km}. Since Hieu cycles at 15 mathrm{~km} / mathrm{h} and Beatrice walks at 5 mathrm{~km} / mathrm{h}, then Hieu catches up to In otherIn other words, Hieu closes the frac{5}{6} mathrm{~km} gap at a rate of 10 mathrm{~km} / mathrm{h}, which takes frac{frac{5}{6} mathrm{~km}}{10 mathrm{~km} / mathrm{h}}, or frac{5}{60} mathrm{~h}, or 5 minutes.Solution 2When Beatrice walks at 5 mathrm{~km} / mathrm{h} for 10 minutes, she walks a distance of 5 mathrm{~km} / mathrm{h} times frac{1}{6} mathrm{~h} or stackrel{5}{6} mathrm{~km}.Since Hieu cycles at 15 mathrm{~km} / mathrm{h}, Hieu cycles 15 mathrm{~km} / mathrm{h} times t mathrm{~h}=15 t mathrm{~km} in total over the course Using similar reasoning, Beatrice walks 5 t mathrm{~km} after her initial frac{5}{6} mathrm{~km}. When Hieu catches up to Beatrice, they have travelled exactly the same distance, and so 15 t=5 t+frac{5}{6} which gives 10 t=frac{5}{6} and so t=frac{5}{60}. Thus, Hieu catches up to Beatrice after frac{5}{60} mathrm{~h}, which is equivalent to 5 minutes.(b) (i) There are 60 integers in the interval from 0 to 59 inclusive.This means that there are 60 possible values for b and 60 possible values for h. Since b and h are chosen randomly and independently, then there are 60 times 60=3600 We say that Beatrice and Hieu meet if they are at the same place on the path at the same time, including possibly starting or ending together. pairs of values for b and h for which they meet, and theen divide count the number of Since the path is 2 mathrm{~km} long and Beatrice walks at 5 mathrm{~km} / mathrm{h}, then Beatrice takes frac{2 mathrm{~km}}{5 mathrm{~km} / mathrm{h}}or frac{2}{5} mathrm{~h} or 24 minutes to walk the length of the path.Since the path is 2 mathrm{~km} long and Hieu cycles at 15 mathrm{~km} / mathrm{h}, then Hieu takes frac{2 mathrm{~km}}{15 mathrm{~km} / mathrm{h}} orfrac{2}{15} mathrm{~h} or 8 minutes to cycle the length of the path.Since Beatrice walks the path in 24 minutes and Hieu cycles the path in 8 minutes, 24-8=16. Here is an explanation for why this is true- If Hieu starts before Beatrice (that is, if hb ) but fewer than 16 minutesafter Beatrice (that is, h-b16 ), then Hieu will not catch up to Beatrice. In this case, this is because Hieu is \\"behind\\" previous case, Hieu just caught up to Beatrice at the very end of the path.So we need to count the number of pairs of integer values for h and b with h and bTo do this, we work through the values of b from 0 to 59, in each case determining If b=0, ther of values of h that satisfy the restrictions.If b=1, then h can be any of 1 to 17 , inclusive. Thereb leq 43, we have and b leq 43, then h can be any of b to b+16 inclusive, and since required conditions. Note that there are 44 values of b for which there are 17 valueIf b=44, then h can be any of 44 to 59 , inclusive. We note while h=60 is 16 greate than b=44, it is not an allowed value for h. In this case, there are 16 values for h. If b=45, then h can be any of 45 to 59 , inclusive. There are 15 values for h. As b increases by 1 from 45 to 59 , the number of values of h decreases by 1 in each case, since the maximum value of h does not change while its minimum value increasesWhen b=59, there is 1 value of h (namely, h=59 ) that satisfies the conditions.Therefore, if N is the number of pairs of values of h and b that satisfy the given conditions, thenbegin{aligned}N & =44 times 17+16+15+14+cdots+3+2+1 & =44 times 17+(16+1)+(15+2)+cdots+(10+7)+(9+8) & =44 times 17+8 times 17 & =52 times 17 & =884end{aligned}Finally, this means that the probability that Hieu and Beatrice are at the same place on the path at the same time is frac{N}{3600} or frac{884}{3600}, which simplifies to frac{221}{900}.(ii) As in (i), there are 3600 possible pairs of values for b and h.If M of these pairs result in Hieu and Beatrice meeting, then the probability that they meet is frac{M}{3600}. meet is overline{3600}We are told that the probability is frac{13}{200}, and so frac{M}{3600}=frac{13}{200} which means that M is equal to frac{13 times 3600}{200}=13 times 18=234.As in (i), Hieu takes 8 minutes to cycle the length of the path.Since Beatrice rides a scooter at x mathrm{~km} / mathrm{h} (with x>5 and x5, then frac{120}{x}8.Using a similar analysis to that in (i), Hieu and Beatrice meet whenever h-b is at least 0 and at most frac{120}{x}-8This means that we need to determine the range of possible values of x for which there are 234 pairs of integer value and 59, inclusive, and h-b geq 0 and h-b leq frac{120}{x}-8.Since h and b are integers, then h-b is an integer. Let t be the largest integer less than or equal to 120Note that, since t is the largest such integer, t+1 is greater than frac{120}{x}-8.Note also that frac{120}{x}-8 is greater than 0 and less than 16 , which means that t is between 0 and 15 , inclusive. This means that subject to the range restrictions on h and b, the value of h-b can be fres As in (i), we count the number of pairs of values for h.through the values of b. When b of pairs of values for h and b by working systematically .When b=1, there are t+1 possible values for h, namely the integers from 1 to t+1, inclusive.Similarly, while b leq 59-t, there are t+1 possible values for h. Since these values ofb run from 0 to 59-t, inclusive, there are 60-t such values of b. When b=(59-t)+1=60-t, the largest possible value of h is still 59 (which corresponds to h-b=t-1 ) and so there are t possible values for h. As in (i), the number of possible values of h decreases by 1 each time b increases by 1 until b=59. 1 until b=59. Since the total number of pairs of values for b and h is 234 , thenbegin{aligned}234 & =(60-t)(t+1)+t+(t-1)+cdots+2+1 234 & =(60-t)(t+1)+frac{1}{2} t(t+1) 468 & =2(60-t)(t+1)+t(t+1) 468 & =(120-2 t)(t+1)+t(t+1) 468 & =(120-t)(t+1)end{aligned}When t=3, the right side is equal to 117 times 4 which equals 468 .Expanding, we obtain 468=-t^{2}+119 t+120 or t^{2}-119 t+348=0 Factoring, weFactoring, we obtain (t-3)(t-116)=0. Since t is between 0 and 15, inclusive, then t=3.Since t is 3 , the greatest integer less than or equal to frac{120}{x}-8 is 3 .This means that frac{120}{x}-8 geq 3 and frac{120}{x}-8<4.Thus, frac{120}{x} geq 11 and frac{120}{x}<12, which tells us that 10<x leq frac{120}{11}, which is the range of possible values for x."},{"problem":"In triangle A B C, let D be the midpoint of side B C.

Primitive Root and Function Definition:   - For any prime ( p ), there exists a primitive root ( g ) modulo ( p ).    - Let ( n = g^k ) for some integer ( k ).    - Define a function ( c ) such that ( g^{c(k)} = f(n) ). This implies ( g^{c(c(k))} = f(f(n)) ).2. Rewriting the Problem:   - Given the condition ( n cdot f(n) cdot f(f(n)) - 1 ) is a multiple of ( p ), we can rewrite it using the primitive root:     [     g^k cdot g^{c(k)} cdot g^{c(c(k))} equiv 1 pmod{p}     ]   - Simplifying, we get:     [     g^{k + c(k) + c(c(k))} equiv 1 pmod{p}     ]   - Since ( g ) is a primitive root, ( g^r equiv 1 pmod{p} ) if and only if ( r equiv 0 pmod{p-1} ). Therefore:     [     k + c(k) + c(c(k)) equiv 0 pmod{p-1}     ]3. Claim: ( c ) is Bijective:   - Injectivity:     - Assume ( c(a) = c(b) ). This implies ( c(c(a)) = c(c(b)) ).     - Let ( Q = c(a) + c(c(a)) = c(b) + c(c(b)) ). Then:       [       Q + a equiv Q + b equiv 0 pmod{p-1}       ]     - Since the domain has each residue modulo ( p-1 ) exactly once, ( a = b ). Thus, ( c ) is injective.   - Surjectivity:     - Since ( c ) has a finite domain and codomain, each of which have equal cardinality, injectivity implies surjectivity.4. Summing Over All ( k ):   - Since ( c(k) ) is bijective, ( c(c(k)) ) is also bijective.

If d were odd, then every second term of the sequence would be even, and the terms could not be prime numbers. (We are, of course, considering only integers as terms.) Therefore, d must be divisible by 2. If d were not divisible by 3, then among any three consecutive terms of the sequence, one would always be divisible by 3, so d must also be divisible by 3. Similarly, it can be shown that d is divisible by 5 and 7, so d is divisible by 2 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdot 7 = 210.In order to work with as small (positive) numbers as possible, we look for a sequence with a difference of d = 210. We will examine the primes that can be the starting term a of the sequence in increasing order until we find one for which all terms (a + 210i) for (0 leq i leq 9) are prime. It is clear that a geq 11.We expect to find a solution where every term is less than 2500, so it is sufficient to ensure that the subsequent terms (1 leq i leq 9) are not divisible by any prime less than sqrt{2500} = 50. The starting term itself can only be divisible by such a prime if it is equal to it.We can work with smaller numbers if, for successive values of p, we consider the remainder m of the division (a : p) instead of a and the remainder r of the division (210 : p) instead of d, i.e., a = alpha p + m, 210 = delta p + r, where alpha, delta are natural numbers, 0 leq m < p and 0 < r < p. Thus, we consider the following 10 numbers:m, m + r, m + 2r, ldots, m + 9rsince m + ri = (a + 210i) - (alpha + delta i) cdot p is divisible by p if and only if (a + 210i) is divisible by it.For each of the above p values, we collect in a table those values of m for which (1) none of the terms is divisible by p.

The further search is significantly simplified by taking as a basis that a gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 11. The first such prime number is 23, but it also gives a prohibited remainder for p = 13. Similarly, a = 67, 89 give prohibited remainders for p = 17, 13, and 45, 111, 133, 155, and 177 are not prime. The number a = 199 gives remainders of 1, 4, 12, 9, 15, 25, 13, 14, 35, 27, 11 for the above primes, all of which are allowed, and a = 199 itself is prime, so the first ten terms of the arithmetic sequence with starting term a = 199 and difference d = 210 are certainly prime.Remarks. 1.

Substitution and Transformation:   We start by substituting ( y = x - 2 ). This transforms the interval ( 1 leq x leq 3 ) to ( -1 leq y leq 1 ). The polynomial ( x^3 - ax^2 - bx - c ) becomes:   [   (y+2)^3 - a(y+2)^2 - b(y+2) - c   ]   Expanding and simplifying, we get:   [   y^3 + (6 - a)y^2 + (12 - 2a - b)y + (8 - 4a - 2b - c)   ]   Let ( a' = 6 - a ), ( b' = 12 - 2a - b ), and ( c' = 8 - 4a - 2b - c ). The problem reduces to finding the minimum value of:   [   G = max_{-1 leq y leq 1} |y^3 + a'y^2 + b'y + c'|   ]   over all real numbers ( a', b', c' ).2. Form of the Polynomial:   We need to minimize the maximum absolute value of the polynomial ( y^3 + a'y^2 + b'y + c' ) over the interval ( -1 leq y leq 1 ). 3. Choosing Coefficients:   Consider the polynomial ( y^3 - frac{3}{4}y ). We need to check if this polynomial achieves the minimum possible maximum value over the interval ( -1 leq y leq 1 ). 4. Checking Extremal Values:   The extremal values of ( y^3 - frac{3}{4}y ) occur at ( y = pm 1 ) and ( y = 0 ). Evaluating at these points:   [   y = 1: quad 1^3 - frac{3}{4}(1) = frac{1}{4}   ]   [   y = -1: quad (-1)^3 - frac{3}{4}(-1) = -frac{1}{4}   ]   [   y = 0: quad 0^3 - frac{3}{4}(0) = 0   ]   The maximum absolute value is ( frac{1}{4} ).5. Verification:   Suppose there exists a polynomial ( y^3 + a'y^2 + b'y + c' ) with a smaller maximum absolute value over ( -1 leq y leq 1 ). By differentiation, the extremal values of ( y^3 + b'y ) occur at ( y = pm sqrt{-b'/3} ) (if ( b' < 0 )) and ( y = pm 1 ).    If ( b' < -frac{3}{4} ), then ( y = 1 ) gives a maximum greater than ( frac{1}{4} ), and ( y = -1 ) gives a minimum less than ( -frac{1}{4} ). This implies that the magnitude of the polynomial exceeds ( frac{1}{4} ), which is inadmissible.   If ( b' > -frac{3}{4} ), similar arguments show that the magnitude of the polynomial exceeds ( frac{1}{4} ).6. Conclusion:   Therefore, the smallest possible value of ( F ) is achieved when ( a = 0 ), ( b = -frac{3}{4} ), and ( c = 0 ), giving ( F = frac{1}{4} ).The final answer is ( boxed{frac{1}{4}} )."},{"problem":"Given that cos alpha= frac {4}{5}, where alpha in (0, pi), find the value of tan alpha.","solution":"We know that cos alpha= frac {4}{5} and alpha is an acute angle since it lies within the interval (0, pi).

For what value of n will the ratio of the surface area to the volume of the remaining solid be the smallest?","solution":"We solve the problem for an arbitrary tetrahedron instead of a regular tetrahedron. At each vertex of the tetrahedron, we cut off a small tetrahedron such that any edge emanating from the cut vertex is 1/n of the original edge. Consequently, the small tetrahedra can be transformed into the original tetrahedron by a central similarity of ratio n. Let the surface area of the tetrahedron be A, and its volume be V. The same data for the remaining solid are denoted by A_{n} and V_{n}. Let the areas of the tetrahedron's faces be T_{1}, T_{2}, T_{3}, T_{4}. When cutting, from the face of area T_{i}, we cut off an area of 3 cdot frac{T_{i}}{n^{2}}, and each cut, when the vertex opposite to T_{i} is cut off, creates a face of area frac{T_{i}}{n^{2}}. Therefore,[A_{n}=T_{1}+T_{2}+T_{3}+T_{4}-3 frac{T_{1}+T_{2}+T_{3}+T_{4}}{n^{2}}+frac{T_{1}+T_{2}+T_{3}+T_{4}}{n^{2}}]which simplifies to[A_{n}=Aleft(1-frac{2}{n^{2}}right)]Similarly, we find that V_{n}=Vleft(1-frac{4}{n^{3}}right), and thus[frac{A_{n}}{V_{n}}=frac{A}{V} cdot frac{1-frac{2}{n^{2}}}{1-frac{4}{n^{3}}}=frac{A}{V} cdot frac{n^{3}-2 n}{n^{3}-4}]Since frac{A}{V} is a positive constant, the minimum of frac{A_{n}}{V_{n}} is at the same place as the minimum of frac{n^{3}-2 n}{n^{3}-4}. But frac{n^{3}-2 n}{n^{3}-4}=frac{n^{3}-4+4-2 n}{n^{3}-4}= 1-frac{2 n-4}{n^{3}-4}, which is the smallest when frac{2 n-4}{n^{3}-4} is the largest, or when frac{n^{3}-4}{2 n-4} is the smallest. The latter is minimal at the same place where f(n)=frac{n^{3}-4}{n-2}. The function f(n) can be written as:[f(n)=frac{n^{3}-2^{3}-4}{n-2}=n^{2}+2 n+4+frac{4}{n-2}]We show that f(n) is strictly increasing for n geq 3. This can be shown as follows:[begin{gathered}f(n+1)-f(n)=(n+1)^{2}+2(n+1)+4+frac{4}{(n+1)-2}-n^{2}-2 n-4-frac{4}{n-2}= =2 n+3-frac{4}{(n-1)(n-2)} geq 2 cdot 3+3-frac{4}{(3-1)(3-2)}=9-2=7end{gathered}]From this, it follows that for n geq 3, frac{A_{n}}{V_{n}} is the smallest when n=3. From the above form of frac{A_{n}}{V_{n}}, we have frac{A_{2}}{V_{2}}=frac{A}{V}, frac{A_{3}}{V_{3}}=frac{A}{V} cdot frac{21}{23}, so for all integers n>1, the minimum of frac{A_{n}}{V_{n}} is at n=3.László Szobonya (Fazekas M.

Substituting b=2 into the fraction, we get:[frac{{2x+a}}{{x-2}} = 0.]Substituting x=0.5, we have:[frac{{2(0.5)+a}}{{0.5-2}} = 0.]Simplifying the numerator and denominator, we get:[frac{{1+a}}{{-1.5}} = 0.]For the fraction to be zero, the numerator must be zero. Therefore, we solve for a:[1 + a = 0 Rightarrow a = -1.]3. Condition for c:With a=-1 and b=2, the fraction simplifies to frac{{2x-1}}{{x-2}}. We are given that the fraction equals 3 for some value of x=c. Setting up the equation:[frac{{2x-1}}{{x-2}} = 3.]Cross-multiplying to solve for x, we get:[2x - 1 = 3(x - 2).]Expanding and simplifying:[2x - 1 = 3x - 6 Rightarrow x = 5.]Therefore, the value of c that satisfies the condition is x=5.

The key to solving it is to analyze the geometric meaning of f(x_1) - f(x_2) geqslant 4(x_1 - x_2).  Assume x_1 > x_2, then x_1 - x_2 > 0. From f(x_1) - f(x_2) geqslant 4(x_1 - x_2), we can deduce that dfrac{f(x_1) - f(x_2)}{x_1 - x_2} geqslant 4, meaning the slope between any two distinct points P(x_1, y_1) and Q(x_2, y_2) on the graph of f(x) = aln x + (x + 1)^2 (x > 0) is not less than 4, i.e., the derivative is not less than 4.

If we then write the sine rule, we get:sin gamma=frac{sin 58^{circ}}{a} cdot cThe first surprise comes after substitution: if we substitute the approximate value of a, then sin gamma approx 1.000056 is obtained, which is not possible. Before we think that the triangle does not exist, let's consider that the triangle can be constructed without any further issues. The problem lies elsewhere.When we rounded a to two decimal places, 8.48 is smaller than the actual value, thus reducing the denominator in the sine rule and increasing the value of the fraction and thus sin gamma. The consequence of rounding is usually the inaccuracy of the final result, but in this case, gamma is in a critical range: approximately 90^{circ}, with a sine value close to 1. The rounding, therefore, changes not the value of the result but its nature. It also becomes clear that sin gamma is approximately 1, indicating that the triangle is nearly a half-cut equilateral triangle, with an angle of about 90^{circ} at vertex C.Let's calculate more precisely. With four decimal places, a approx 8.4828 and then sin gamma approx 0.9997.If someone gets this far, they only need to determine whether gamma is an acute or obtuse angle. gamma is the largest angle in the triangle, but nothing more can be deduced from the given data.

That is, m^2 - 3m = 0 while m^2 - m - 6 ne 0. Solving m^2 - 3m = 0, we get m(m - 3) = 0, which gives m = 0 or m = 3. But since m = 3 makes the imaginary part zero as well, we only consider m = 0 for z to be a pure imaginary number. Thus, we have: boxed{m = 0.} (4) z is zero if both its real and imaginary parts are zero. This happens if both equations m^2 - 3m = 0 and m^2 - m - 6 = 0 are satisfied simultaneously. We found earlier that this occurs at m = 3. Hence: boxed{z = 0 text{ for } m = 3.} (5) To determine when the point corresponding to z is in the third quadrant, we require the real part to be negative (which occurs when m^2 - 3m < 0) and the imaginary part to be negative (which occurs when m^2 - m - 6 < 0). Solving each inequality:For the real part (m^2 - 3m < 0), the solution is between the roots of the corresponding equation, which is when 0 < m < 3.For the imaginary part (m^2 - m - 6 < 0), the solution is also between the roots of the corresponding equation, which are m = -2 and m = 3, hence -2 < m < 3.Combining these two conditions, the interval for m is the intersection, which is 0 < m < 3. Therefore, when m is within the interval (0,3), z corresponds to a point in the third quadrant. Thus, we have: boxed{m in (0, 3) text{ for } z text{ in the third quadrant.}} "},{"problem":"# Problem 5. (3 points)In trapezoid A B C D, the lateral side A B is equal to the diagonal A C.

Suppose the opposite. Then their product is positive, and the number preceding them (counterclockwise) is also a natural number.

Then A_{i-1} is visible to A_{j}, A_{j} is visible to A_{k}, and A_{k} is visible to A_{i+1}.Proof of Lemma 1: Consider the triangulation of the polygon that includes the edges A_{i} A_{j} and A_{i} A_{k}.Lemma 2: Using the notation from Lemma 1, A_{j} A_{k} is an edge.Proof of Lemma 2: Assume A_{j} A_{k} is a diagonal inside the polygon.By Lemma 1, A_{j} can see A_{j-1}. But A_{j} A_{i} and A_{j} A_{k} are internal diagonals, so A_{j} A_{i-1} is an edge.Thus, on the boundary of the polygon, there is only one vertex between A_{i} and A_{j}.Similarly, there is only one vertex between A_{j} and A_{k}, and between A_{k} and A_{i} on the boundary of the polygon. This contradicts n>6.Therefore, A_{j} A_{k} is an edge, and k=j-1.Lemmas 1 and 2 are proved.Let i be such that A_{i-1} and A_{i+1} are mutually visible (such an i exists, for example, take the outermost triangle in the triangulation of the polygon).By Lemma 2, A_{i-1} can see A_{i+2}, A_{i+1} can see A_{i-2}, and A_{i-2} can see A_{i+2}. Thus, we have found four vertices such that both A_{i-1} and A_{i+1} can see these four vertices.If A_{i} can see some vertex, then A_{i-1} and A_{i+1} must also see it (by Lemma 1). Therefore, A_{i} can see A_{i-2} and A_{i+2}, which implies that A_{i-2} A_{i+2} is an edge (by Lemma 2). Any convex polygon can serve as an example.The remaining case is n=6. In this case, by Lemma 2, there exist vertices A_{i}, A_{j}, A_{k} such that A_{i} A_{j}, A_{j} A_{k}, and A_{k} A_{i} are internal diagonals of the polygon.Without loss of generality, assume they are A_{2}, A_{4}, A_{6} in the hexagon. Then, A_{3} cannot be seen by A_{6}, which implies that either angle A_{2} or angle A_{4} is greater than 180^{circ}, and thus, A_{3} cannot be seen by either A_{1} or A_{5}. In fact, A_{3} can be seen by the other four vertices, which is a contradiction.Therefore, there does not exist a polygon satisfying the problem for n=6.Thus, only n=5 is possible."},{"problem":"A rectangle has an area of 16 and a perimeter of 18; determine the length of the diagonal of the rectangle.[i]2015 CCA Math Bonanza Individual Round #8[/i]","solution":"1. Let the lengths of the sides of the rectangle be ( a ) and ( b ). We are given two pieces of information:   - The area of the rectangle is ( ab = 16 ).   - The perimeter of the rectangle is ( 2(a + b) = 18 ), which simplifies to ( a + b = 9 ).2. To find the length of the diagonal, we use the Pythagorean theorem. The length of the diagonal ( d ) of a rectangle with sides ( a ) and ( b ) is given by:   [   d = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}   ]3. First, we need to find ( a^2 + b^2 ). We start by squaring the equation ( a + b = 9 ):   [   (a + b)^2 = 9^2   ]   [   a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 81   ]4. We know from the area that ( ab = 16 ). Substitute ( 2ab ) into the equation:   [   a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 81   ]   [   a^2 + 2(16) + b^2 = 81   ]   [   a^2 + 32 + b^2 = 81   ]5. Subtract 32 from both sides to isolate ( a^2 + b^2 ):   [   a^2 + b^2 = 81 - 32   ]   [   a^2 + b^2 = 49   ]6. Now, substitute ( a^2 + b^2 = 49 ) into the formula for the diagonal:   [   d = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}   ]   [   d = sqrt{49}   ]   [   d = 7   ]Conclusion:The length of the diagonal of the rectangle is ( boxed{7} )."},{"problem":"Given a point P on the ellipse frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 left(a > b > 0right), where F_1 and F_2 are the left and right foci of the ellipse, respectively.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the largest possible number of elements in a finite set ( S ) of real numbers such that for any three distinct elements ( x, y, z in S ), at least one of ( x+y ), ( x+z ), or ( y+z ) is also in ( S ).2. Initial Claim:   We claim that the largest possible number of elements in ( S ) is 7, and a possible set is ( {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3} ).3. Verification of the Claim:   Let's verify that the set ( S = {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3} ) satisfies the given condition. We need to check that for any three distinct elements ( x, y, z in S ), at least one of ( x+y ), ( x+z ), or ( y+z ) is also in ( S ).   - Consider any three distinct elements ( x, y, z ) from ( S ).   - If one of these elements is 0, say ( x = 0 ), then ( x+y = y ) and ( x+z = z ), both of which are in ( S ).   - If none of the elements is 0, we need to check the sums of pairs of elements from ( {-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3} ).4. Checking Non-zero Elements:   - For ( {-3, -2, -1} ):     - ( -3 + (-2) = -5 ) (not in ( S ))     - ( -3 + (-1) = -4 ) (not in ( S ))     - ( -2 + (-1) = -3 ) (in ( S ))   - For ( {1, 2, 3} ):     - ( 1 + 2 = 3 ) (in ( S ))     - ( 1 + 3 = 4 ) (not in ( S ))     - ( 2 + 3 = 5 ) (not in ( S ))   We see that in both cases, at least one of the sums is in ( S ).5. Maximality Argument:   - Suppose ( S ) has more than 7 elements. Consider adding another element ( a ) to ( S ). We need to ensure that for any three distinct elements ( x, y, a in S ), at least one of ( x+a ), ( y+a ), or ( x+y ) is in ( S ).   - Adding any element outside the range ([-3, 3]) will likely violate the condition, as the sums involving this new element may not be in ( S ).6. Conclusion:   - The set ( S = {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3} ) satisfies the given condition.   - Any larger set will not satisfy the condition, as shown by the argument above.The final answer is ( boxed{7} )"},{"problem":"A pair of real numbers (a, b) with a^{2}+b^{2} leq frac{1}{4} is chosen at random.

This region is shaded in the first diagram above.Let r=frac{1}{2}.The area of each circle is pi r^{2}.To determine the shaded area, we subtract the unshaded area from the area of the circle. By symmetry, the unshaded area below the x-axis will equal the unshaded area above the x-axis. In the second diagram above, the origin is labelled O, the point where the circle centred at O intersects the x-axis is labelled B, and the point of intersect in the first quadrant of the two cicles is labelled A. The unshaded region above the x-axis consists of triangle A O B plus two curvilinear regions.Since O A and O B are radii of the circle centred at O, then O A=O B=r.Since A B is a radius of the circle centred at B, then A B=r.This means that triangle O A B is equilateral, and so it has three 60^{circ} angles.When triangle O A B is combined with the curvilinear region above and to the right of triangle O A B, we thus obtain a sector of the circle with centre O and central angle 60^{circ}.Since 60^{circ} is frac{1}{6} of 360^{circ}, this sector is frac{1}{6} of the entire circle and so has area frac{1}{6} pi r^{2}.Similarly, when triangle O A B is combined with the curvilinear region above and to the left of triangle O A B, we obtain a sector of the circle with centre B and central angle 60^{circ}; this sector has area frac{1}{6} pi r^{2}. If K is the area of equilateral triangle O A B, the area of each curvilinear region is frac{1}{6} pi r^{2}-K and so the unshaded area above the x-axis is equal to 2left(frac{1}{6} pi r^{2}-Kright)+K which simplifies to frac{1}{3} pi r^{2}-K. Thus, the total unshaded area inside the circle of area pi r^{2} is frac{2}{3} pi r^{2}-2 K, which means that the shaded area inside the circle is pi r^{2}-left(frac{2}{3} pi r^{2}-2 Kright) which is equal to frac{1}{3} pi r^{2}+2 K.Finally, we need to use the area of an equilateral triangle with side length r. This area is equal to frac{sqrt{3}}{4} r^{2}. (To see this, we could use an altitude to divide the equilateral triangle into two 30^{circ}-60^{circ}-90^{circ} triangles. Using the ratio of side lengths in these special triangles, this altitude has length frac{sqrt{3}}{2} r and so the area of the equilateral triangle is frac{1}{2} rleft(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right) or frac{sqrt{3}}{4} r^{2}.)Therefore, the fraction of the circle that is shaded isfrac{frac{1}{3} pi r^{2}+frac{sqrt{3}}{2} r^{2}}{pi r^{2}}=frac{frac{1}{3} pi+frac{sqrt{3}}{2}}{pi}=frac{2 pi+3 sqrt{3}}{6 pi} approx 0.609This means that the probability, p, that a point (a, b) satisfies the given conditions is approximately 0.609 and so 100 p approx 60.9.Of the given choices, this is closest to 61, or (E).ANswer: (E)"},{"problem":"If x in mathbb{R}, then \\"x=0\\" is the (　　　) condition for \\"x^2-2x=0\\".A: Sufficient but not necessary conditionB: Necessary but not sufficient conditionC: Necessary and sufficient conditionD: Neither sufficient nor necessary condition","solution":"From the equation x^2 - 2x = 0, we can factor it as x(x - 2) = 0.

The work rate per person per day is:   [   frac{3}{5} times frac{1}{9} times frac{1}{14} = frac{1}{210}   ]   This means each person completes frac{1}{210} of the job per day.2.

The logarithmic sum given in the problem is:   [   log_8 a_1 + log_8 a_2 + cdots + log_8 a_{12} = 2006   ]3.

Therefore, the equation becomes:   [   log_8 (a^{12} r^{66}) = 2006   ]7.

Case ( n = p ) (where ( p ) is a prime number):   - If ( n = p ), consider the construction where the marked squares are placed at coordinates ((i, i)) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, p ). This ensures that every ( p times 1 ) or ( 1 times p ) rectangle contains at least one marked square. Since ( p ) is prime, there are no other divisors of ( p ) except 1 and ( p ), so this construction works.3. Case ( n = p^2 ) (where ( p ) is a prime number):   - For ( n = p^2 ), we can use the construction ((1 + ap + b, 1 + bp + a)) for ( 0 le a, b < p ).

We need to find the least possible value for alpha such that the inequality    [   (a+b)^x geq a^x + b   ]   holds for all x geq alpha, given that a > 1 and b > 0.2. Let's start by testing alpha = 1. We need to check if the inequality holds for x = 1:   [   (a+b)^1 geq a^1 + b   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   a + b geq a + b   ]   This is true, so alpha = 1 is a candidate.3. Next, we need to show that the function f(x) = (a+b)^x - a^x - b is increasing for x geq 1. We will do this by showing that the derivative f'(x) is non-negative for x geq 1.4. Compute the derivative of f(x):   [   f'(x) = frac{d}{dx} left( (a+b)^x - a^x - b right)   ]   Using the chain rule, we get:   [   f'(x) = (a+b)^x ln(a+b) - a^x ln(a)   ]5. We need to show that f'(x) geq 0 for x geq 1. This means:   [   (a+b)^x ln(a+b) geq a^x ln(a)   ]6. Since a > 1 and b > 0, we have a+b > a > 1. Therefore, ln(a+b) > ln(a) > 0. Also, (a+b)^x > a^x for x geq 1 because a+b > a.7. Thus, (a+b)^x ln(a+b) > a^x ln(a) for x geq 1, which implies f'(x) geq 0 for x geq 1. Therefore, f(x) is increasing for x geq 1.8. Since f(x) is increasing for x geq 1 and f(1) = 0, it follows that f(x) geq 0 for x geq 1. This means:   [   (a+b)^x geq a^x + b quad text{for all} quad x geq 1   ]9. To confirm that alpha = 1 is the least possible value, assume alpha < 1. Let x = 1 - epsilon for some small epsilon > 0. We need to check if the inequality holds:   [   (a+b)^{1-epsilon} geq a^{1-epsilon} + b   ]10. Using the binomial approximation for small epsilon, we have:    [    (a+b)^{1-epsilon} approx (a+b) left(1 - epsilon ln(a+b)right)    ]    and    [    a^{1-epsilon} approx a left(1 - epsilon ln(a)right)    ]11. Substituting these approximations, we get:    [    (a+b) left(1 - epsilon ln(a+b)right) geq a left(1 - epsilon ln(a)right) + b    ]12. Simplifying, we get:    [    a + b - epsilon (a+b) ln(a+b) geq a - epsilon a ln(a) + b    ]13. Canceling a + b from both sides, we get:    [    -epsilon (a+b) ln(a+b) geq -epsilon a ln(a)    ]14. Dividing by -epsilon (which is positive), we get:    [    (a+b) ln(a+b) leq a ln(a)    ]15. Since a > 1 and b > 0, we have a+b > a > 1 and ln(a+b) > ln(a) > 0. Therefore, (a+b) ln(a+b) > a ln(a), which contradicts the inequality. Hence, alpha < 1 cannot be the least possible value.16.

They come every other day and paint one plot each (there are 100 plots) in red or green. The first painter is colorblind and confuses the colors; he remembers which and in what color he painted himself, and sees what the second painter painted, but does not know the color. The first painter aims to achieve the maximum number of places where a green plot borders a red one. What is the maximum number of transitions he can achieve (regardless of how the second painter acts)?Note. It is assumed that the summer cottage plots are arranged in a single line.## SolutionFirst, let's show how the first painter can ensure at least 49 transitions. We divide the plots into pairs: (1, 2), (3, 4), ..., (99, 100). Then the first painter can ensure that in each pair with an even number, there is a red color, and in each pair with an odd number, there is a green color. For this, it is sufficient to act as follows: if the second painter paints a plot, then the first painter paints the other plot from the same pair so that the pair definitely contains the required color; if the other plot from the pair is already painted, then the first painter paints any plot in the required color. Thus, in each pair, there will be at least one plot of the required color, and therefore, the number of transitions will be at least 49. Now, let's show how the second painter can ensure that the number of transitions does not exceed 49. For this, it is sufficient to paint the plot from the same pair in the same color after each move of the first painter. Then each pair will be monochromatic, and therefore, the total number of transitions will not exceed 49.## Answer49 transitions."},{"problem":"Example 6.18.

Permutations Using Cycles:   - By using the ( n )-cycle, we can shift all pieces cyclically.   - By using the 4-cycle, we can permute any 4 consecutive pieces.   - For example, if we have 5 adjacent pieces ( a, b, c, d, e ), we can perform the following permutations:     [     (a, b, c, d, e) rightarrow (c, d, a, b, e) rightarrow (c, a, b, e, d) rightarrow (a, b, e, c, d)     ]     This shows that we can generate any 3-cycle within the 5 pieces.6. Achieving the Desired Permutation:   - Using the 3-cycle and 4-cycle, we can move ( C_1 ) to ( V_1 ), then ( C_2 ) to ( V_2 ), and so on, without disturbing the already placed pieces.   - For the last few pieces, if we end up with ( C_{n-3}, C_{n-2}, C_n, C_{n-1} ) in ( V_{n-3}, V_{n-2}, V_{n-1}, V_n ) respectively, we can use the 4-cycle to rearrange them as needed.7. Final Adjustment:   - Use the 4-cycle to get ( C_{n-1}, C_{n-3}, C_{n-2}, C_n ).   - Then use the 3-cycle to get ( C_{n-3}, C_{n-2}, C_{n-1}, C_n ).Thus, the minimum number of segments in a harmonic set is ( n+1 ).The final answer is (boxed{n+1})."},{"problem":"Given: 2^{a+1}=3, {2}^{b-3}=frac{1}{3}, which of the following statements is incorrect?A: a+b=2B: 1＜b＜frac{3}{2}C: b-a lt 1D: ab gt 1","solution":"Given the equations 2^{a+1}=3 and 2^{b-3}=frac{1}{3}, let's solve for a and b step by step.First, we solve for a:begin{align*}2^{a+1} &= 3 Rightarrow a+1 &= log_{2}3 Rightarrow a &= log_{2}3 - 1end{align*}Next, we solve for b:begin{align*}2^{b-3} &= frac{1}{3} Rightarrow 2^{b-3} &= 2^{-1} Rightarrow b-3 &= -1 Rightarrow b &= 3 - log_{2}3end{align*}Now, let's verify the statements given:A: a+b=2begin{align*}a+b &= (log_{2}3 - 1) + (3 - log_{2}3) &= 2end{align*}Thus, statement A is correct.B: 1＜b＜frac{3}{2}begin{align*}log_{2}3^{2} &＞ log_{2}2^{3} 2 &＞ log_{2}3 > frac{3}{2} 1 &＜ 3-log_{2}3 ＜ frac{3}{2} 1 &＜ b ＜ frac{3}{2}end{align*}Therefore, statement B is correct.C: b-a lt 1begin{align*}b-a &= (3-log_{2}3) - (log_{2}3-1) &= 4 - 2log_{2}3 &lt 1end{align*}Thus, statement C is correct.D: ab gt 1begin{align*}ab &= (log_{2}3-1)(3-log_{2}3) &= -(log_{2}3)^{2} + 4log_{2}3 - 3 &= -(log_{2}3-2)^{2} + 1 &＜ 1end{align*}Therefore, statement D is incorrect.Hence, the incorrect statement is boxed{D}."},{"problem":"In a 10×10 grid square, the centers of all unit squares are marked (a total of 100 points).

Each license plate must contain 8 digits, each of which can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 or 9. Furthermore, two distinct license plates must always have at least two different digits. For example, if it puts the license plate 00000000 into circulation, the government cannot put the license plate 00010000 into circulation.Find the maximum number of license plates that the government can put into circulation.","solution":"We will show that the maximum number of available plates is equal to 10^{7}.First, we say that two plates belong to the same family if their first seven digits are different. Each family contains ten plates, so there are 10^{7} distinct families. However, the government cannot put more than one plate from each family into circulation. Therefore, it can put at most 10^{7} plates into circulation.Conversely, the government can manage to create 10^{7} plates as follows: the last digit of each plate is equal to the negative of the sum, modulo 10, of the first seven digits of the plate. Thus, it creates one plate per family.Moreover, the sum of the digits of each plate is divisible by 10. But if two plates differ in exactly one digit, the sums of their digits cannot be equal to each other (modulo 10). Therefore, two distinct plates always differ in at least two digits, which concludes the proof.Graders' Comments This difficult exercise was fully solved by only one student. Several students found interesting constructions or lower bounds, allowing them, for example, to assert that at least 10^{4} or 8!=40320 license plates could be put into place.However, very few students managed to obtain the appropriate construction to reach 10^{7} plates. The most reliable way to achieve such a construction was to look at what would happen with 1 digit, then 2 digits, then 3 digits, and to identify regular patterns that appeared in all relevant copies: an integer was equal to the sum of the others.Furthermore, and independently, very few students attempted to find an upper bound on the number of possible plates, even though a simple application of the pigeonhole principle would have sufficed here, and many students seemed to have an intuition about it. It is always a pity not to seek upper and lower bounds when trying to estimate a quantity, and even if these bounds are not necessarily easy to find."},{"problem":"Let H be a Hilbert space over the field of real numbers Bbb R.

Substitution and Definitions:   Let ( u = pi ) and ( v = sqrt{2} ). For each ( z in H ), define:   [   g_z(t) = f(t + uz) - f(t + vz)   ]   and   [   h_z(t) = g_z(t) - g_z(0).   ]2. Properties of ( g_z ) and ( h_z ):   We have:   [   g_z(x + y) + g_z(0) = g_z(x) + g_z(y)   ]   which implies:   [   h_z(x + y) = h_z(x) + h_z(y).   ]   By the standard argument, ( h_z ) is (mathbb{Q})-linear and, since ( h_z ) is continuous, it is also (mathbb{R})-linear.3. Riesz Representation Theorem:   By the Riesz representation theorem, there exists ( r_z in H ) such that:   [   h_z(t) = langle r_z, t rangle   ]   for all ( t in H ), where ( langle cdot, cdot rangle ) is the inner product in ( H ).4. Expression for ( g_z ):   Let ( c_z = g_z(0) ). Then:   [   f(t + uz) - f(t + vz) = g_z(t) = c_z + langle r_z, t rangle.   ]5. Functional Equation:   For any ( t, z, w in H ), we have:   [   f(t + u(z + w)) - f(t + v(z + w)) = (f((t + uz) + uw) - f((t + uz) + vw)) + (f((t + vw) + uz) - f((t + vw) + vz)).   ]   This gives:   [   c_{z + w} + langle r_{z + w}, t rangle = c_w + langle r_w, t + uz rangle + c_z + langle r_z, t + vw rangle.   ]   Since this holds for all ( t in H ), we conclude:   [   c_{z + w} = c_z + c_w + u langle r_w, z rangle + v langle r_z, w rangle,   ]   and   [   r_{z + w} = r_z + r_w.   ]6. Symmetry and Linearity:   Exchanging ( z ) and ( w ) in the equation for ( c_{z + w} ) gives:   [   langle r_w, z rangle = langle r_z, w rangle.   ]   For any ( lambda in mathbb{R} ), we have:   [   langle lambda r_z, w rangle = lambda langle r_z, w rangle = lambda langle r_w, z rangle = langle r_w, lambda z rangle = langle r_{lambda z}, w rangle.   ]   Taking ( w = r_{lambda z} - lambda r_z ) shows that ( r_{lambda z} = lambda r_z ) for all ( lambda in mathbb{R} ) and all ( z in H ).7. Linearity and Continuity:   Combined with the additivity property, we see that the map ( z mapsto r_z ) is an (mathbb{R})-linear map from ( H ) to ( H ). It is also symmetric, hence by the Hellinger–Toeplitz theorem, it is continuous, i.e., a self-adjoint operator on ( H ).8. Rewriting ( c_{z + w} ):   Now, the equation for ( c_{z + w} ) can be rewritten as:   [   c_{z + w} = c_z + c_w + (u + v) langle r_z, w rangle.   ]   If we write ( d_z = c_z - frac{u + v}{2} langle r_z, z rangle ), which is again continuous in ( z ), then the above equality becomes:   [   d_{z + w} = d_z + d_w.   ]   It follows that the map ( z mapsto d_z ) is a continuous (mathbb{R})-linear map from ( H ) to (mathbb{R}).9. Final Form of ( f ):   In the expression for ( g_z ), replace ( t ) with ( -vz ):   [   f((u - v)z) = f(0) + c_z - v langle r_z, z rangle = f(0) + frac{u - v}{2} langle r_z, z rangle + d_z.   ]   Replacing ( z ) with ( frac{z}{u - v} ), we get:   [   f(z) = f(0) + frac{1}{2(u - v)} langle r_z, z rangle + frac{1}{u - v} d_z.   ]10. Conclusion:    In conclusion, we have:    [    f(z) = a + b(z) + langle c(z), z rangle    ]    where:    - ( a ) is a real number,    - ( b: H rightarrow mathbb{R} ) is a continuous linear functional on ( H ),    - ( c: H rightarrow H ) is a continuous self-adjoint operator on ( H ).

CD is the height of the base of the regular triangular pyramid. The side PAB is tangent to the hemisphere at point E. Connect OE, OE perp PD, OE=1, PO= h.Let angle PDO=alphaleft(0^{circ}<alpha<90^{circ}right). Since OE perp PD, we have OE perp PE. Therefore, OE is the radius of the hemisphere, and OE=1. Thus, PE=1. In the right triangle POE, we have PO^2=PE^2+OE^2, which means h^2=1^2+1^2=2, so h=sqrt{2}. However, this is not the final answer, as we need to find the minimum value of the volume V of the regular triangular pyramid.The volume V of the regular triangular pyramid is given byV=frac{1}{3} times text{base area} times text{height}=frac{1}{3} times frac{sqrt{3}}{4} a^2 times h=frac{sqrt{3}}{12} a^2 h,where a is the side length of the base. Since OE perp PD, we have sin alpha=frac{OE}{PO}=frac{1}{h}, and cos alpha=frac{PE}{PO}=frac{1}{h}. Therefore, h=frac{1}{sin alpha}=frac{1}{cos alpha}. Since a=2 sqrt{3} cos alpha, we haveV=frac{sqrt{3}}{12} times (2 sqrt{3} cos alpha)^2 times frac{1}{cos alpha}=frac{sqrt{3}}{12} times 12 cos^2 alpha times frac{1}{cos alpha}=frac{sqrt{3}}{sin^2 alpha cos alpha}.Since sin^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha = 1, we have sin^2 alpha = 1 - cos^2 alpha. Therefore, sin^2 alpha cos alpha = (1 - cos^2 alpha) cos alpha = cos alpha - cos^3 alpha. Let f(alpha) = cos alpha - cos^3 alpha. Then f'(alpha) = -sin alpha + 3 cos^2 alpha sin alpha = sin alpha (3 cos^2 alpha - 1). Since 0 < alpha < 90^{circ}, we have sin alpha > 0. Therefore, f'(alpha) > 0 Leftrightarrow 3 cos^2 alpha - 1 > 0 Leftrightarrow cos^2 alpha > frac{1}{3} Leftrightarrow cos alpha > frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, so bybegin{aligned}sin^4 alpha cos^2 alpha & =frac{1}{2} sin^2 alpha cdot sin^2 alpha cdot 2 cos^2 alpha & leqslant frac{1}{2}left(frac{sin^2 alpha+sin^2 alpha+2 cos^2 alpha}{3}right)^3 & =frac{4}{27},end{aligned}we know 0<sin^2 alpha cos alpha leqslant frac{2 sqrt{3}}{9}, soV=frac{sqrt{3}}{sin^2 alpha cos alpha} geqslant frac{sqrt{3}}{frac{2 sqrt{3}}{9}}=frac{9}{2}.When and only when sin^2 alpha=2 cos^2 alpha, i.e., cos alpha=frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, the above equation takes the equal sign, i.e., V takes the minimum value frac{9}{2}, and the corresponding h=frac{1}{cos alpha}=sqrt{3}.

Suppose that function f: mathbb{N} rightarrow mathbb{N} satisfies the problem conditions.Lemma. For any prime p and any x, y in mathbb{N}, we have x equiv y(bmod p) if and only if f(x) equiv f(y) (bmod p). Moreover, p mid f(x) if and only if p mid x.Proof. Consider an arbitrary prime p. Since f is surjective, there exists some x in mathbb{N} such that p mid f(x). Letd=min {x in mathbb{N}: p mid f(x)} .By induction on k, we obtain that p mid f(k d) for all k in mathbb{N}. The base is true since p mid f(d). Moreover, if p mid f(k d) and p mid f(d) then, by the problem condition, p mid f(k d+d)=f((k+1) d) as required.Suppose that there exists an x in mathbb{N} such that d not x but p mid f(x). Lety=min {x in mathbb{N}: d backslash x, p mid f(x)} .By the choice of d, we have y>d, and y-d is a positive integer not divisible by d. Then p nmid f(y-d), while p mid f(d) and p mid f(d+(y-d))=f(y). This contradicts the problem condition. Hence, there is no such x, andp|f(x) Longleftrightarrow d| x .Take arbitrary x, y in mathbb{N} such that x equiv y(bmod d). We have p mid f(x+(2 x d-x))=f(2 x d); moreover, since d mid 2 x d+(y-x)=y+(2 x d-x), we get p mid f(y+(2 x d-x)). Then by the problem condition p|f(x)+f(2 x d-x), p| f(y)+f(2 x d-x), and hence f(x) equiv-f(2 x d-x) equiv f(y) (bmod p).On the other hand, assume that f(x) equiv f(y)(bmod p). Again we have p mid f(x)+f(2 x d-x) which by our assumption implies that p mid f(x)+f(2 x d-x)+(f(y)-f(x))=f(y)+f(2 x d-x). Hence by the problem condition p mid f(y+(2 x d-x)). Using (1) we get 0 equiv y+(2 x d-x) equiv y-x (bmod d).Thus, we have proved thatx equiv y quad(bmod d) Longleftrightarrow f(x) equiv f(y) quad(bmod p) .We are left to show that p=d : in this case (1) and (2) provide the desired statements.The numbers 1,2, ldots, d have distinct residues modulo d. By (2), numbers f(1), f(2), ldots, f(d) have distinct residues modulo p; hence there are at least d distinct residues, and p geq d. On the other hand, by the surjectivity of f, there exist x_{1}, ldots, x_{p} in mathbb{N} such that fleft(x_{i}right)=i for any i=1,2, ldots, p. By (2), all these x_{i} 's have distinct residues modulo d. For the same reasons, d geq p. Hence, d=p.Now we prove that f(n)=n by induction on n. If n=1 then, by the Lemma, p nmid f(1) for any prime p, so f(1)=1, and the base is established. Suppose that n>1 and denote k=f(n). Note that there exists a prime q mid n, so by the Lemma q mid k and k>1.If k>n then k-n+1>1, and there exists a prime p mid k-n+1; we have k equiv n-1 (bmod p). By the induction hypothesis we have f(n-1)=n-1 equiv k=f(n)(bmod p). Now, by the Lemma we obtain n-1 equiv n(bmod p) which cannot be true.Analogously, if k1, so there exists a prime p mid n-k+1 and n equiv k-1(bmod p). By the Lemma again, k=f(n) equiv f(k-1)=k-1(bmod p), which is also false. The only remaining case is k=n, so f(n)=n.Finally, the function f(n)=n obviously satisfies the condition."},{"problem":"If the two square roots of a positive number a are m+7 and 2m-1, then the cube root of a-m is ______.","solution":"To solve the given problem, let's follow the steps closely related to the provided solution:1.

However, being opposite numbers involves more than just having opposite signs; they also need to have the same absolute value but different signs. Therefore, this statement is not entirely accurate as it oversimplifies the definition of opposite numbers. This makes option A the incorrect statement.Option B: To verify if -frac{11}{5} and 2.2 are opposite numbers, we convert 2.2 into a fraction to compare it directly with -frac{11}{5}. We find that 2.2 = frac{22}{10} = frac{11}{5}. Since one is the negative of the other, -frac{11}{5} and frac{11}{5} (or 2.2) are indeed opposite numbers. This means the statement in option B is correct.Option C: The process of making a number its opposite involves adding a \\"-\\" sign in front of the number if it's positive, or removing the \\"-\\" sign if it's negative. This changes the sign of the number, making it the opposite. Therefore, the statement in option C is correct.Option D: If two numbers are opposite numbers to each other, their opposites will also be opposites to each other. This is because taking the opposite of an opposite brings you back to the original number. For example, if a and -a are opposites, then -(-a) and -(a) are also opposites, which simplifies to a and -a again.

Let d be the distance from the center of circle C at point (1,1) to line l:   d=frac{|2cdot1-1+1|}{sqrt{2^2+1^2}}=frac{2}{sqrt{5}}<sqrt{2},   which indicates that the line l intersects with the circle C.2. Solving the system of equations composed of l and C yields:   begin{cases} y=2x+1  x^2+y^2-2x-2y=0 end{cases},   which results in the solutions:   begin{cases} x=frac{1+sqrt{6}}{5}, y=frac{7+2sqrt{6}}{5} end{cases} text{ and } begin{cases} x=frac{1-sqrt{6}}{5}, y=frac{7-2sqrt{6}}{5} end{cases}.

Dragomir has 6 pairs of socks in a drawer. Each pair of socks is different from every other pair in the drawer. He randomly removes 4 individual socks from the drawer, one at a time.

There are 12 socks that he can remove 1st, then 11 socks 2 nd, then 10 socks 3 rd, and finally 9 socks 4 th.This means that there are 12 times 11 times 10 times 9 ways in which he can remove 4 socks one at a time. Suppose that there is exactly one pair among the 4 socks removed. There are 6 different possibilities for how this pair was formed: 1st and 2nd socks match, 1st and 3rd match, 1st and 4th match, 2nd and 3rd match, 2nd and 4th match, 3rd and 4th match.We determine the number of ways in which each of these possibilities can arise.Case 1: Matching pair 1st and 2ndThere are 12 socks that he can pick 1 st (no restrictions).There is 1 sock that he can pick 2nd (pair of 1st).There are 10 socks that he can pick 3rd (any of the 10 remaining socks).There are 8 socks that he can pick 4th (any of the 9 remaining socks other than pair of 3rd). In this case, there are 12 times 1 times 10 times 8 ways.Case 2: Matching pair 1st and 3rdThere are 12 socks that he can pick 1st (no restrictions).There are 10 socks that he can pick 2nd (all but pair of 1st).There is 1 sock that he can pick 3rd (pair of 1st).There are 8 socks that he can pick 4th (any other than pair of 2 nd).In this case, there are 12 times 10 times 1 times 8 ways.Case 3: Matching pair 1st and 4thThere are 12 socks that he can pick 1st (no restrictions).There are 10 socks that he can pick 2nd (all but pair of 1st).There are 8 socks that he can pick 3rd (all but pair of 1st and pair of 2 nd).There is 1 sock that he can pick 4th (pair of 1st).In this case, there are 12 times 10 times 8 times 1 ways.Case 4: Matching pair 2nd and 3rdThere are 12 socks that he can pick 1 st (no restrictions).There are 10 socks that he can pick 2nd (all but pair of 1st).There is 1 sock that he can pick 3rd (pair of 2nd).There are 8 socks that he can pick 4 th (all but pair of 1st).In this case, there are 12 times 10 times 1 times 8 ways.Case 5: Matching pair 2nd and 4thThere are 12 socks that he can pick 1st (no restrictions).There are 10 socks that he can pick 2nd (all but pair of 1st).There are 8 socks that he can pick 3rd (all but pair of 1st and pair of 2nd).There is 1 sock that he can pick 4th (pair of 2 nd).In this case, there are 12 times 10 times 8 times 1 ways.Case 6: Matching pair 3rd and 4thThere are 12 socks that he can pick 1st (no restrictions).There are 10 socks that he can pick 2nd (all but pair of 1st).There are 8 socks that he can pick 3rd (all but pair of 1st and pair of 2 nd).There is 1 sock that he can pick 4th (pair of 3rd).In this case, there are 12 times 10 times 8 times 1 ways.In each of the six cases, there are 12 times 10 times 8 times 1 ways in which the socks can be chosen.Therefore, the overall probability is frac{6 times 12 times 10 times 8 times 1}{12 times 11 times 10 times 9}=frac{6 times 8}{11 times 9}=frac{2 times 8}{11 times 3}=frac{16}{33}.Solution 2Since there are 12 socks in the drawer, there are binom{12}{4}=frac{12 times 11 times 10 times 9}{4 times 3 times 2 times 1}=11 times 5 times 9=495 ways of choosing 4 socks.Next, we count the number of ways in which the 4 chosen socks can include exactly 1 matching pair.There are 6 possible matching pairs that can be chosen.The remaining 2 socks must come from 2 different pairs of the remaining 5 pairs. If we label the remaining pairs A, B, C, D, E, there are 10 possible two-pair combinations from which these 2 socks can be chosen: mathrm{AB}, mathrm{AC}, mathrm{AD}, mathrm{AE}, mathrm{BC}, mathrm{BD}, mathrm{BE}, mathrm{CD}, mathrm{CE}, mathrm{DE}. (We could also use a binomial coefficient to calculate this total.)For each of the 2 pairs from which these 2 socks will be chosen, there are in fact 2 socks to chooseThus, the total number of ways in which the 4 socks can be chosen that satisfy the given conditions is 6 times 10 times 2 times 2=240.This means that the probability is frac{240}{495}=frac{16 times 15}{33 times 15}=frac{16}{33}.Solution 3Since there are 12 socks in the drawer, there are binom{12}{4}=frac{12 times 11 times 10 times 9}{4 times 3 times 2 times 1}=11 times 5 times 9=495 ways of choosing 4 socks.These 4 socks can include 0 matching pairs, 1 matching pair, or 2 matching pairs. We count the number of ways in which the 4 chosen socks can include 0 matching pairs or 2 matching pairs and subtract this from the total number of ways of choosing 4 socks to obtain the number of ways of choosing 1 matching pair.To choose 0 matching pairs, we choose 4 of the 6 pairs and choose 1 of the 2 socks in each pair. There are binom{6}{4}=frac{6 times 5 times 4 times 3}{4 times 3 times 2 times 1}=15 ways of choosing 4 of 6 pairs, and 2^{4}=16 ways of choosing 1 of the 2 socks in each of 4 pairs.Thus, there are 15 times 16=240 ways of choosing exactly 0 matching pairs.To choose 2 matching pairs, we choose 2 of the 6 pairs and choose both socks in each pair.There are binom{6}{2}=frac{6 times 5}{2 times 1}=15 ways of choosing 2 of 6 pairs, and 1 way to choose both socks in each pair.Thus, there are 15 times 1=15 ways of choosing exactly 2 matching pairs.This means that there are 495-240-15=240 ways of choosing exactly 1 matching pair.

There are d-1 lattice points (vertices of the squares) on the diagonal, dividing the diagonal into d segments, with the length distribution of the segments in each segment being the same (same or opposite color). Each segment is the diagonal of an a times b chessboard, which does not contain any lattice points inside, so the segments alternate in color.(1) If a and b are one odd and one even, the midpoint of the diagonal of each a times b chessboard is the midpoint of one side of a square. The segments on the diagonal are symmetrically distributed about the midpoint and have opposite colors, so the total lengths of the red and blue segments are equal.

Divide the diagonal a b into a b equal parts, with the division points labeled as 1,2, cdots, a b-1, each small segment has a length of v= frac{sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}}{a b}. The points j b(1 leqslant j leqslant a-1) are the intersection points of the diagonal with the horizontal grid lines, and i a(1 leqslant i leqslant b- 1) are the intersection points with the vertical grid lines. They are the boundary points of the red and blue segments, and the other division points are removed. j b divides the diagonal into a intervals, each of length b v. The points i a are distributed in these intervals, with at most one point in each interval, so exactly b-1 intervals each contain one point, and the other a-b+1 intervals are empty. Next, we calculate the algebraic sum of the lengths of the red and blue segments in the two types of intervals (red segments are positive, blue segments are negative. The sign of any segment is (-1)^{k}, k is the number of division points to the left of the segment, including the left endpoint of the segment).Empty intervals are entirely one color, the first one is red (since a>b). Adjacent empty intervals are separated by an even number of segments, so they have opposite colors. Since the number of empty intervals is odd, the algebraic sum of the lengths of all empty intervals is b v.Let i a=q_{i} b+r_{i}left(1 leqslant r_{i} leqslant b-1right), then the division point i a is in the interval left[q_{i} b,left(q_{i}+1right) bright], dividing it into two segments of opposite colors, the left segment has a length of r_{i} v, and the right segment has a length of left(b-r_{i}right) v. Note that there are q_{i}+i-1 division points to the left of this interval (including q_{i} b). Therefore, the algebraic sum of the lengths of the two segments in this interval isleft((-1)^{q_{i}+i-1} r_{i}+(-1)^{q_{i}+i}left(b-r_{i}right)right) v=(-1)^{q_{i}+i}left(b-2 r_{i}right) v .Since aleft(q_{i}+iright)=q_{i}(a+b)+r_{i}, a+b is even, and a is odd, q_{i}+i has the same parity as r_{i}. Also, since a and b are coprime, as i takes all values from 1,2, cdots, b-1, r_{i} also takes all values from 1,2, cdots, b-1. Thus, the algebraic sum of the lengths of the segments in all non-empty intervals isv sum_{i=1}^{b-1}(-1)^{q_{i}+i}left(b-2 r_{i}right)=v sum_{r_{i}=1}^{s-1}(-1)^{r_{i}}left(b-2 r_{i}right) .Since b-1 is even, this sum is equal tovleft(0-2 sum_{i=1}^{b-1}(-1)^{r} rright)=-(b-1) v text {. }Thus,begin{array}{c}u=b v-(b-1) v=v, L-S=d u=frac{sqrt{m^{2}+n^{2}}}{m n}(m, n)^{2},end{array}which is consistent with the result when b=1.In summary, when a b is even, i.e., when m and n have different powers of the prime factor 2, L=frac{sqrt{m^{2}+n^{2}}}{2}; and when m and n have the same powers of the prime factor 2, L=frac{sqrt{m^{2}+n^{2}}}{2 m n}left((m, n)^{2}+m nright), where (m, n) is the greatest common divisor of m and n."},{"problem":"Blinkov A.D:On the side AB of rectangle ABCD, a point M is chosen.

We have:[begin{aligned}& 2^{1} quad bmod 10=2 quad ; quad 2^{2} quad bmod 10=4 quad ; quad 2^{3} quad bmod 10=8 & 2^{4} quad bmod 10=6 quad ; quad 2^{5} quad bmod 10=2end{aligned}]Thus, we are dealing with a 4-cycle. Let (n in mathbb{N}) and (2^{n}) be given. If (n bmod 4=1), (2^{n}) ends in 2; if (n bmod 4=2), it ends in 4; if (n bmod 4=3), it ends in 8; and if (n bmod 4=0), it ends in 6. No other possibilities exist.Since (3217 bmod 4=1), (2^{3217}) ends in 2, and (2^{3217}-1) consequently ends in 1.The information that (2^{3217}-1) is a prime number was not needed for solving the problem."},{"problem":"Given lines l_1: x+2y-3=0 and l_2: 2x-ay+3=0, find the value of a such that the lines are parallel.","solution":"Since lines l_1 and l_2 are parallel, their slopes are equal.

This problem illustrates the analogy between integers and polynomials (specifically here, polynomials over the finite field of integers modulo 3), with x^{2}+1(bmod 3) taking the role of a prime number. Indeed, we can prove analogously to Fermat's little theorem that f(x)^{3^{operatorname{deg}left(x^{2}+1right)}} equiv f(x) (mod left.x^{2}+1,3right) for any polynomial f(x) : try to work out the proof yourself!

Since any even power of (1+i) (for n leq 6 ) yields a purely real or purely imaginary number with a coefficient not divisible by 3 , multiplying it by 1+i will yield an imaginary part not divisible by 3 .

Among k and k+1, one is even, and the other is odd. Suppose k is even. Then 2^{n-1} mid k(k+1), and by Gauss, 2^{n-1} mid k. Thus, a 2^{n-1} = k, and substituting into n 2^{n-1} = k(k+1), we get n = a(k+1), so k+1 mid n. But then k+1 leq n and 2^{n-1} leq k.Combining these, we get 2^{n-1} < 3.By induction, if we have an n > 2 such that 2^{n-1} > n, then 2^n > 2n > n+1, and this will still be true for n+1, which concludes the induction.Thus, for n geq 3, 2^{n-1} > n.The case where k is odd is resolved in the same way, by swapping k and k+1.

For instance, consider:   [   ax^2 + bx + c = ax^2 + cx + b   ]   Subtracting the right-hand side from the left-hand side, we get:   [   (ax^2 + bx + c) - (ax^2 + cx + b) = 0   ]   Simplifying, we obtain:   [   (b - c)x + (c - b) = 0   ]   Factoring out ((b - c)), we have:   [   (b - c)(x - 1) = 0   ]   Since (a, b, c) are distinct, (b neq c). Therefore, we must have:   [   x - 1 = 0 implies x = 1   ]2. Case 2: Same coefficient of (x)   Suppose that two of the numbers have the same coefficient of (x). For instance, consider:   [   ax^2 + bx + c = cx^2 + bx + a   ]   Subtracting the right-hand side from the left-hand side, we get:   [   (ax^2 + bx + c) - (cx^2 + bx + a) = 0   ]   Simplifying, we obtain:   [   (a - c)x^2 + (c - a) = 0   ]   Factoring out ((a - c)), we have:   [   (a - c)(x^2 - 1) = 0   ]   Since (a neq c), we must have:   [   x^2 - 1 = 0 implies x = pm 1   ]   If (x = -1), the expressions become:   [   a - b + c, quad a - c + b, quad b - c + a, quad b - a + c, quad c - a + b, quad c - b + a   ]   None of these are equal for distinct (a, b, c). Thus, (x = -1) is not a valid solution. Therefore, (x = 1).3. Case 3: Same constant term   Suppose that two of the numbers have the same constant term.

Thus, (x = 0) is not a valid solution. Therefore, (x = 1).4. Case 4: Cyclic equality   Suppose that three of the numbers are in a cycle. For instance, consider:   [   ax^2 + bx + c = bx^2 + cx + a = cx^2 + ax + b   ]   This gives us the system of equations:   [   (a - b)x^2 + (b - c)x + (c - a) = 0   ]   [   (b - c)x^2 + (c - a)x + (a - b) = 0   ]   The roots of the first equation are:   [   x = 1 quad text{or} quad x = frac{c - a}{a - b}   ]   The roots of the second equation are:   [   x = 1 quad text{or} quad x = frac{a - b}{b - c}   ]   Equating the non-1 roots, we get:   [   frac{c - a}{a - b} = frac{a - b}{b - c}   ]   Cross-multiplying, we obtain:   [   (c - a)(b - c) = (a - b)(a - b)   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   (c - a)(b - c) = (a - b)^2   ]   Similarly, we can derive:   [   (b - c)^2 = (a - b)(c - a)   ]   Multiplying these equations, we get:   [   (c - a)^2 = (a - b)(b - c)   ]   The only solution to (x^2 = yz, y^2 = xz, z^2 = xy) is (x = y = z).

First, understand that 2023pi/6 can be decomposed into a sum of a multiple of 2pi (which represents a full sine cycle) and a remainder. The goal is to find this remainder because the sine of a full cycle plus any remainder is just the sine of the remainder.2. Recognize that 2023pi/6 can be expressed as 336pi + pi + pi/6 because 2023 = 336 times 6 + 7, and thus 2023pi/6 = 336pi + 7pi/6 = 336pi + pi + pi/6.3. Note that 336pi represents 168 full cycles of sine (2pi times 168 = 336pi), which effectively brings us back to our starting point on the unit circle.4. The remaining part, pi + pi/6, points to the fact that we are looking at the angle pi/6 radians past pi radians on the unit circle. 5. The sine function is symmetrical around pi radians, so the sine of an angle theta radians past pi is the negative sine of that angle from 0: sin(pi + theta) = -sin(theta).6. Therefore, sinleft(frac{2023pi}{6}right) = sinleft(336pi + pi + frac{pi}{6}right) = sinleft(pi + frac{pi}{6}right).7. Using the symmetry property mentioned, we find sinleft(pi + frac{pi}{6}right) = -sinleft(frac{pi}{6}right).8.

The chain rule states that if a function y is composed of another function u such that y=f(u) and u=g(x), then the derivative of y with respect to x is given by frac{dy}{dx}=frac{dy}{du}cdotfrac{du}{dx}. In our case, u=2x-1 and y=ln(u). Therefore, frac{dy}{du}=frac{1}{u} and frac{du}{dx}=2.

First, we apply the quotient rule of logarithms to the numerator:lg frac {1}{4} - lg 25 = lgleft(frac{1}{4} times frac{1}{25}right) = lgleft(frac{1}{100}right) = -2Next, we address the denominator:2log_{5}10 + log_{5}0.25 = 2log_{5}(2 times 5) + log_{5}left(frac{1}{4}right) = 2log_{5}10 + log_{5}1 - log_{5}4We know that log_{5}10 is the same as lg 10 in base 5. Since 10 = 5 times 2, we can easily see that log_{5}10 = log_{5}(5 times 2) = 1 + log_{5}2. Moreover, log_{5}1 = 0 because any log base of 1 is 0.

Therefore, CG = GE = GD (as radii of the circle), meaning triangle C G D and triangle C G E are isosceles, and thus G F is the altitude in triangle C G E.Since angle C A D = 30^{circ} is an inscribed angle subtending arc C D, and angle C G D is a central angle subtending the same arc, angle C G D = 60^{circ}, making triangle C G D equilateral.Let angle E A D = alpha, then angle E C D = alpha as an inscribed angle subtending the same arc D E. Therefore, angle G C F = 60^{circ} - alpha, angle C A B = 30^{circ} + alpha, and thus angle C B A = 90^{circ} - (30^{circ} + alpha) = 60^{circ} - alpha.

Applying the double-angle identity for cosine, we have cos 2A = 2cos^2 A - 1.

Substituting cos A = frac{1}{3}, we get cos^2 frac{A}{2} = frac{1+frac{1}{3}}{2} = frac{2}{3}.For the second term, we substitute cos A = frac{1}{3} directly, yielding 2cos^2 A = 2(frac{1}{3})^2 = frac{2}{9}.Combining these results, we get frac{2}{3} + frac{2}{9} - 1 = boxed{-frac{1}{9}}.(2) Given cos A = frac{1}{3}, we can find sin A using the Pythagorean identity: sin A = sqrt{1 - cos^2 A} = sqrt{1 - frac{1}{9}} = frac{2sqrt{2}}{3}.By the Law of Cosines, a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bccos A.

Which positive integers M satisfy S(M cdot k) = S(M) for every integer k such that 1 leq k leq M?","solution":"I. solution. M=1 naturally fits, since k can only be 1. For larger Ms, let's examine the choice k=2. We know that a number divided by 9 gives the same remainder as the sum of its digits. Thus,9 mid M-S(M), quad text { and } quad 9 mid 2 M-S(2 M)from which, by taking their difference,9 mid(2 M-S(2 M)-(M-S(M))=M-S(2 M)+S(M)=MThe condition of the problem can therefore only be satisfied for numbers divisible by 9, apart from 1.Suppose M is an n-digit number that satisfies the condition of the problem:10^{n-1} leqq MM geqq 10^{n}-a geqq 10^{n}-9only one number divisible by 9 can fall into this range: 10^{n}-1, which is the number written with n nines. (n is any positive integer.)We will show that numbers of this form fit. Let M=10^{n}-1 and 2 leqq k leqq M. Thenk M=(k-1) 10^{n}+10^{n}-k=(k-1) 10^{n}+left(10^{n}-1right)-(k-1)Here, the first term ends with n zeros, the second is the number written with n nines, and the subtrahend is at most n-digit. Thus, the sum of the digits is again the sum of the sum of the digits of the first term and the difference. The sum of the digits of the first term is S(k-1), and in forming the difference, each digit of k-1 must be subtracted from 9, so no carrying occurs. Thus, the sum of the digits of the difference is 9 n-S(k-1). The sum of the digits of k M is therefore 9 n, which is equal to S(M). This is what we wanted to show.II. solution. From the previous solution, we take over that only numbers divisible by 9 come into question, and that the numbers 1 and of the form 10^{n}-1 fit. Relying on these, we will see that these already give all the suitable numbers.Let M be a number greater than 1 that fits. Let n be the positive integer for which left(10^{n}-1right) / 9 leqq M< left(10^{n+1}-1right) / 9. Choosing the lower bound for kS(k M)=Sleft((M / 9)left(10^{n}-1right)right)Here, M / 9<left(10^{n+1}-1right) / 81<left(10^{n}-1right). Since left(10^{n}-1right) fits the condition of the problem,Sleft(frac{M}{9}left(10^{n}-1right)=Sleft(10^{n}-1right)=9 nright.If M is n-digit, then this can only match S(M) if M is the number written with n nines, 10^{n}-1. If M is (n+1)-digit, then its first digit can only be 1 and the rest of its digits must be 0, because it is smaller than the number written with all ones. In this case, however, its sum of digits would be at most 1+9(n-1)<9 n. Therefore, indeed only the numbers mentioned fit the condition.This is the solution by Tamás Fleiner.Remarks: 1. In the same way, it follows for any base b number system that the numbers 1 and those written with all (b-1) digits have the desired property.2. We saw that numbers not divisible by 9 do not satisfy the desired equality even for k=2. However, it does not seem to be an easy question to determine the smallest k for which this happens for a number divisible by 9. The second solution shows this for a somewhat larger k than the first. However, a \\"bad\\" k value can be found for many numbers, which is much smaller than the one provided by the first solution. For example, 2 is such a k for 324, 3 for 126, 4 for 117, 5 for 351, 6 for 189, but for 198, the first solution provided 101 as the smallest k value. It is not clear what properties of the number the smallest k value depends on."},{"problem":"On a spherical planet of radius R the intensity of attraction is measured gravitational at a heigh x from the surface, the same measurements is made at a depth equal to the height, achieving both situations the same result.Find the value of x that satisfies this characteristics of the gravitational field.[i]Proposed by Francisco Soriano, Cortes[/i]","solution":"1.

Then from 15=a+b+c=a+d+g it follows that b+c=d+g=6. However, notice that two numbers can sum to 6 only if they are 2 and 4 (indeed, the possibility 3+3 is ruled out because the numbers must be distinct, and the possibility 1+5 is ruled out because the number 5 is already used for e), so we have actually reached a contradiction.Therefore, the number 9 cannot be placed in a corner, and must be in the middle of a side. For example, let b=9. Then similarly as before, we get a+c=6, i.e., a=2 and c=4 or vice versa. Whichever of these two possibilities we choose (and they are mutually analogous), it is easy to see that the rest of the magic square can be filled in a unique way (the filling on the right is shown for a=2 and c=4).Thus, the number 5 must always be in the center, and then the number 9 can be written in the middle of a side, which gives 4 possibilities for the number 9.

(2) Find the area enclosed by the graph of the function f(x) and the x-axis.","solution":"(1) We first find whether the function f(x) is increasing or decreasing in the interval left[frac{pi}{2}, piright]. To do this, we calculate the derivative of f(x):f'(x) = 1 + cos x.Since cos x is always less than or equal to 1, for x in the given interval,f'(x) geq 0.This indicates that the function f(x) is monotonically increasing on left[frac{pi}{2}, piright].Now, to find the minimum value of f(x), we evaluate it at the lower endpoint:f_{min} = fleft(frac{pi}{2}right) = frac{pi}{2} + sinleft(frac{pi}{2}right) = frac{pi}{2} + 1.Similarly, for the maximum value of f(x), we evaluate it at the upper endpoint:f_{max} = f(pi) = pi + sin(pi) = pi.Therefore, since the function is increasing, the range of f(x) is from its minimum to its maximum value, which gives us the range as:boxed{text{Range of } f(x) = left[frac{pi}{2} + 1, piright]}.(2) To find the area S enclosed by the graph of the function f(x) and the x-axis over the given interval, we integrate f(x) from frac{pi}{2} to pi:S = int_{frac{pi}{2}}^{pi} f(x) ,dx = int_{frac{pi}{2}}^{pi} (x + sin x) ,dx.Calculating the antiderivative, we find:int (x + sin x) ,dx = frac{1}{2}x^2 - cos x + C.Evaluating this from frac{pi}{2} to pi, we get:S = left[frac{1}{2}x^2 - cos xright]_{frac{pi}{2}}^{pi} = left(frac{1}{2}pi^2 - cos piright) - left(frac{1}{2}left(frac{pi}{2}right)^2 - cos left(frac{pi}{2}right)right),S = frac{1}{2}pi^2 + 1 - left(frac{1}{8}pi^2 - 0right),S = frac{1}{2}pi^2 + 1 - frac{1}{8}pi^2,S = frac{4}{8}pi^2 - frac{1}{8}pi^2 + 1,S = frac{3pi^2}{8} + 1.Hence, the area enclosed by the graph of the function and the x-axis is:boxed{S = frac{3pi^2}{8} + 1}."},{"problem":"Let left{a_{n}right} be a sequence of positive integers that is monotonically increasing, that is,1 leqq a_{1} leqq a_{2} leqq ldots leqq a_{n} leqq ldotsFor any integer m geqq 1, let b_{m} be the index of the first element in the sequence left{a_{n}right} that is at least as large as m.If a_{19}=88, then between what bounds can the suma_{1}+a_{2}+ldots+a_{19}+b_{1}+b_{2}+ldots+b_{88}vary?","solution":"I.

Color the cell in the i-th row and j-th column black if j leq a_{i}, otherwise leave the cell white.In the i-th row, there are clearly a_{i} black cells, so in the table, we have coloreda_{1}+a_{2}+ldots+a_{19}cells black.Count the white cells column by column. In the j-th column, the cells in the rows where a_{i} < j remain white; the number of these is exactly the number of elements in the sequence left{a_{n}right} that are less than j, which, by the definition of left{b_{n}right}, is precisely b_{j}-1. Therefore, the total number of white cells isleft(b_{1}-1right)+left(b_{2}-1right)+ldots+left(b_{88}-1right)Every cell in the 19 times 88 table is either black or white, so the value of the sum in question is19 cdot 88 + 88 = 1760for every monotonically increasing sequence left{a_{n}right} such that a_{19}=88.II.

By the definition of the sequence left{b_{n}right}, the sequence left{a_{n}right} has b_{m}-1 elements less than m, so left(b_{m+1}-1right)-left(b_{m}-1right)=b_{m+1}-b_{m} elements are exactly m.Since a_{19}=88 by the condition, the number 88 clearly appears left(20-b_{88}right) times.
