If i were your treating physician, i would suspect viral infection and i would recommend you to go for few work ups like blood CBC, PS for MP, RBS, creatinine and SGPT.       I would have advised you to take antibiotics (like cefixime for 5 to 7days), paracetamol (to control fever and headache), Antihistaminics (like cetrizine) and pantoprazole (for stomach upset). Because most of these medicines are prescription medicines, you can meet your local doctor and confirm it.      You can come back to me after all the reports anytime, so i can guide you further.

The easiest way to check this is get a blood sample taken and checked for malarial parasite(called MPFT test) . The key being the sample of blood ideally has to be taken at the time you have fever. This increases the sensitivity of the test and gives us a better chance of diagnosis. Once the diagnosis is established the treatment for malaria is relatively straightforward.

I am 20 years old on antidepressants and overweight but others then that I m normally ok","Doctor":"You might have a deeper infection that is not totally cleared out, perhaps some kind of fistula between cystic areas. The redness and pain with leaking of yellow fluid suggest a significant infection that might not totally respond to antibiotics. A fistula is like a tube running from the original cyst into different areas below the skin that can then get infected. The whole cyst and tube would to be surgically removed to get all the infection out. If this one burst on its own, there is probably remaining infection deeper and you will have to have it cut out like the one in your lower stomach. You should discuss with your doctor or consider going to emergency to get it more completely treated. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Yesterday, my mom who is under hospice care due to Parkinson's disease had an episode that appeared to be a stroke. This occurred during her lunch in which she was eating ice cream. She was seen by a doctor who felt that there were several things going on and one of those most likely was stroke-related. Mom was unable to talk, walk, or swallow. Her eyes were dilated, yet she seemed aware of her surroundings and the fact she could not communicate. Many in my family saw Mom in this state yesterday. Today Mom is sitting up, eating, talking, and able to walk with help. She is still very weak and is in a hyper-awareness mode; i.e., difficulty sleeping, more anxious than normal (although she has to be somewhat afraid that another episode like she had could occur again). Mom has had heart arrhythmia's and low blood pressure, but considering her age 81, her low continued decline with weight-loss (maybe 90 lbs.) and Parkinson's disease, this does not surprise us. Do you think that her \\"stroke\\" symptoms were something else, or do you think that her improvement today is an occurrence that others have had in their end-of-life experiences? We are all amazed at what she can do today, but of course wonder how long this blessing will last. Thanks.","Doctor":"She might have had what is called a transient ischemic attack (TIA). This is like a ministroke which clears up within 24 hours. Unfortunately it can be a warning sign that another, bigger stroke may occur. Or it may not happen again. There is really no way to know for sure. You could think of it as occurrence that others have had in their end-of-life experience, as different parts of the body start to fail and then may recover for awhile. Be grateful for the blessing of her (probably) temporary recovery, but aware that the situation may progress. Keep spending quality time with her as you have been doing. Wishing the best for her and your family."},{"Patient":"could streptooccocus bacteria remain in jaccuzzi jets and infect another person? the renter that was here before me, had strep. she said it was misdiagnosed and in a strange way went to her kidney causing life threatening disease which she is still fighting. she said she tried to cure it with herbs and acupunture,etc. she used a lot of essential oils in her jacuzzi bath. when I moved in the jacuzzi jets were ejecting very dark black stuff. I clean and tried to disinfect it many times and ran the jets thru until they ejected no more. Also I used vinegar to clean them. After I thought they were clean I used the tub a few times and once more stuff came out. Could the strep that had infected her somehow infected me? does the strep bacteria remain in and on surfaces even after cleaning? could it enter me? age 60, height 5 1 , 128lbs. hereditary high cholesterol.","Doctor":"The type of strep complication the renter had would not necessarily occur in you, even if you got strep. Certain types of strep can cause kidney injury in people who are susceptible, but it is a particular reaction of the body in only some people. That being said, all sorts of bacteria and other types of infectious organisms can reside in hot tubs and jacuzzi jets and cause infections. A very thorough cleaning by people specialized in this may be necessary. If stuff is still coming out after you've tried to disinfect them several times, I would suggest that this be looked into. In the meantime it would be best to avoid using the tub or at least the jacuzzi jets until this is settled. If you are not having any symptoms or lesions on the skin, you  are probably okay for now.

It occurs at night and is a debilitating pain right under the bust area, almost like a knife being poked out from under the skin. When this happens, breathing is difficult, lying down is utterly painful, the only position confortable is sitting cross legged on grond and having my head tilted forward, arms below head, to relieve the pain from the spasms. They occur mainly at night and the pain continues throughout night, and is debilitating. It may be connected to stress but am unsure. I am desperate to find a cure or way to stop these diaghram spasma, is there a specialist i should visit? I live in Pasadena, CA. Thnak you. Isabelle","Doctor":"Diaphragm spasms are usually more like hiccups, although bad hiccups can also be quite painful. It sounds like you are having esophageal spasms, which can be very painful. Either way, you need to be evaluated for both as treatment may vary. You might also have reflux esophagitis which can be related to aspiration of stomach acid. This can cause laryngeal spasm which can also result in shortness of breath and pain. Your best option is to start with a gastroenterologist (GI specialist). They can do an endoscopy to take a direct look into your esophagus or other tests to check the pressures and see there are muscle spasms or inflammation. Stress could certainly aggravate these conditions, but it would be important to know exactly what is causing them so that the correct treatment is started. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor, My wife has had a real bumpy ride the past few weeks. OUr daughter contracted human parvovirus (5th disease) and it faded with no complications- but then my wife contracted it-- unusual in an adult. she developed the skin rash and then her ankles and lower legs swelled up-- all consistent with adult contraction of parvovirus. But, after 10 days or so, she suddenly began vomiting and became very nauseous-- couldn't hardly eat and had a splitting headache. After getting some gastrointestinal drugs from ER (I was scared!) these too faded. We took her to the doctor-- who had taken blood the week previous in relation to the parvovirus and discovered her white blood cells had crashed to 2 (?) when they should be between 3.5 and 5.0. Also, she seemed to have anemia as well. New blood tests were ordered this past week and her white blood cells were normal-- but she came back positive with mycoplasma pneumococcus-- and an X-ray noted pneumonia. The blood test also revealed her ALT was elevated. Now, she seems to be getting over the pneumonia-- and is eating-- but she still has swelling in her left calf and ankles. Could this all stem from the parvovirus? Could it all stem from the mycoplasma pneumococcus? She was fine a few weeks ago- before the parovirus came in-- but she has been working too hard and has probably exhausted herself. She has a doctor's visit in a few days-- but I'm scared and want her to go earlier. What do you think? Thanks","Doctor":"Adults can get 5th disease and it can cause a generalized arthritis that may last weeks. It does not cause Mycoplasma or pneumococcus, which are particular types of bacteria that can cause pneumonia. However, the initial viral infection plus the overworking and exhaustion could easily have depleted her immune system so that she became more susceptible to infections with these other microbes. The drop in white cells suggests that this is what happened. The elevations in ALT could be related to an inflammatory process in general which is occurring with all these infections. I suspect the swelling may be related to the parvovirus, which can cause, as I said, an inflammatory/arthritic process, which may take some time to resolve. If she is getting worse, then I would want to see her earlier, but if she is remaining stable or showing a little improvement, then she can wait for her regular doctor visit. It is going to take awhile until she gets back to normal. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi, I just woke up in a rather odd state. I went to bed and I was feeling a bit cold, but about an hour ago I woke up violently shivering like I have never done before. I had dreamed I was drowning but I wasn t afraid.

I got out a thermometer and I do have a fever, but something like this has never happened. Now my throat feels like it s on fire, I m burning up, and my urine is so hot it was uncomfortable to pee.","Doctor":"Some infections can start acutely with cold chills and shivering. Later a fever then develops. Often an infection starting like that is bacterial rather than viral, and sometimes pretty significant. Burning urine could actually be due to a bladder or kidney infection. If it is in the kidney, that can often start suddenly with chills and fever. You might also have strep throat, which can also start like this. Best to get checked right away for these possibilities. Then a definite diagnosis can be made and appropriate treatment started before it gets any worse. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"My Grandson who has just turned 10 is into his 4th week of illness.

Now I have left flank pain which is associated with a decrease in urine output, change in colour to muggy yellow/brown with some discomfort. This happened just a couple of months ago for 3 weeks and the doctor prescribed cipro for a UTI eventhough she didn't really think I had a UTI. I did not take the drug until the pain became excruciating. It did not help. About a week later the pain got better suddenly on its own and the day after that I had Strep throat. It seems that I do not have a functional immune system. I have asthma and get migraine headaches during every period. I have recently been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder with panic episodes and have had major depressive disorder for about 10 years. Many people think that my frequent illness is hypochondria but I don't just THINK I'm sick, I AM sick as proven by numerous culture and sensitivity results and blood in my urine with my last episode of flank pain. Please help... Is there something really wrong with me or is it all in my head?","Doctor":"Hello dear,Welcome to HCM. I figured your concern. It is normal condition,that after severe diseases you feel anxiety about your health. I wanted more details about your urine analysis and urine culture,you did not treat your kidneys properly,that's why you have relapse of disease. I suggest--Urine analysis and urine culture-Ultrasound of kidney-If you have infection in urine the best treatment is ceftriaxon 1,0  2 times a day intramuscular for 5 days,then furadonin 1 tablet 3 times for 2 weeks, then cystone 2 tablet 2 times for 1 month. If you have stones in kidneys you should take Stone 1 15ml with 1 glass of water daily for 14 days. -For prophylaxis of recurrent UTI you can use Nalidixic acid(NegGram)1 tablet 4 times for 7 days,  Cystone 2 tab 2times for 1 month, aurvedic medicines, other uroantiseptics.-For Bronchial Asthma take Allegra 1 tablet in bed time for 10 days, Montelucast 1 tablet at night for 1 month-Absorbents(charcoal)3tablets 2 times for absorbtion toxins and gases for 5 days-Visilac,Darolac 1 capsule 2 times  for normal flora of intestine and increasing of immunity.-Exercises,swimming walking -Hypoallergenic diet, plenty of water every day.-Phytotherapy(boiled water from flax seeds,peels of pomegranate, hair from corn and etc)    Take care!

Do you know our grandparents as children have low immunity. Morganella morganii is Gram-negative stick,which live in our intestine, but it cause of community-acquired infection, she can associate with other flora,for instance with our E.coli and cause diarrhea, then by blood this infection can penetrate to urinary tract and cause inflammation. Don't be suprise. If we have too much bacteria in intestine,then they will lead to diarrhea or constipaton.    For normal intestinal flora please give to your Grandma probiotics(Darolac or Visilac 1 capsule twice a day for 1 month).   Take care   Wishing you good health"},{"Patient":"am 55 year old male with cfs with high Epstein bar virus had 2 surgeries 2 years ago and got sick after that tried many things on nexavir now was kutapresson years ago doctors not sure how to help me tried Valtrex for awhile nothing the doctor says I have a current Epstein bar infection","Doctor":"Thank you for following up.

I am 52 years old, am 6' 0\\" and weigh 215lbs. I have had minor allergies and asthma since the age of 16. Otherwise I am in good health. I recently became a bee keeper. I have been stung a number of times now and each time I have swelling of the local area. Sometimes the swelling will travel 3 or 4 inches around the sting. I have also noticed that each time I am stung, after 2 or 3 hours I become lethargic, wanting to do nothing but sleep for the next day or so. My question is, could a honey bee sting cause me to loose energy, thus making me tired, lethargic? Thank you!","Doctor":"Thank you for following up. I think you have local and systemic reactions too honey bees.You shouldknow  in severe reactions, hypotension (low blood pressure), circulatory disturbances, and breathing difficulty can progress to fatal cardiorespiratory arrest. Most people who develop anaphylactic reactions have experienced previous stings with few problems.That's why I suggest-1.Protect your skin from bee bites.2.Take Allergra(Fexofenadine) after bites.3.Apply apple vinegar to affected area.4.For absorbtion of allergens and toxins you can take charcoal 1 tablet/10kg/day for 5 days. Check your level of Ig E to rule out allergy.

Avoid repetitive overhead activities 2. Do not carry any heavy object or bag on affected shoulder or arm.3. Apply ice packs for about 15 minutes twice or thrice daily. 4. If you have learned how to do shoulder exercises then continue with that it's could be effective . 5. Apply diclofenac based topical ointment which is more effective than paracetamol based.(available over the counter)6. Can take oral pain killers if pain is very severe. 7. There is no harm in taking Re-nerve Plus,as it is just a multivitamin supplement which is good for nerves (more useful in diabetic patients).If still pain is persisting then proper examination of shoulder joint is required to find the exact cause and if needed x ray and MRI should be done. You can consult nearby doctor or orthopedician who can write X-ray and MRI of the shoulder after taking complete history and thoroughly clinical examination."},{"Patient":"I live in Tucson AZ and had valley fever about 15 years ago.

It is caused by Coccidiodomitis fungi. It generally presents as respiratory disease with fever.Vertigo is generally not seen with this infection. If you are experiencing vertigo I would recommend you to get yourself evaluated. Vertigo can occur due to inner ear or cerebellar or heart issues(light headedness). A neurologist needs to investigate your condition for that. The bumpy rash below your knee can be a manifestation of valley fever known as erythema nodosum.

It is likely that your anxiety is causing you to have palpitations. When you have an increase in heart rate, as a result of the anxiety, the PR interval tends to get shorter. You could do the following: 1) Try some breathing exercises 2) You could use apps like headspace or calm on a regular basis 3) If the anxiety is unmanageable, it is advisable to visit a psychiatrist and get started on medications like SSRIs. 4) Remember, that there is no stigma associated with the same.

We arrived on Friday evening.  I felt fine all day Saturday and Sunday.  After going in to bed on Sunday night I was restless and had a hard time sleeping.  I started shivering and had chills.  I think I started to scare myself and started having some anxiety which was making me feel like I wasn't breathing right - though I know I wasn't really breathless, didn't have shortness of breath nor was my heart rate irregular.  I ended up taking my temperature at it was just under 100 degrees (normal for me is in the 97-low 98 degrees).  I could tell my temperature rose a bit more as I got really warm then sweaty.  I felt very dehydrated and kept drinking a lot of fluids.  I was somewhat dizzy and felt a slighly nauseated. I couldn't sleep for most of the night.  I took some ibuprofin and finally dosed off around 4 in the morning.  I woke up around 6/7 am and didn't feel any better.  My fever had come back (still low grade) and then I had a headache and body aches.  I did start having some chest tightness and aches in my chest area too - similar to when my asthma acts up. As the morning went on I felt a little bit better but still had a headache, body aches and low grade fever.  We left the area around noon and went back home (which is close to sea level).  I felt much better still had some of the symptoms.  My fever rose to almost 101 during the night (last night) but dropped after taking ibuprofin this morning.  I still have had a slight headache but it and the aches have improved.  Temperature hasn't risen since the night again. Question - does this sound more like a flu or virus or could it have been altitude sickness? or something else?  Some of the symptoms sound like it could have been but not sure since I did have a fever and it came on after 48 hrs of being at that elevation (we slept at the lower elevation).","Doctor":"Hi i did review your concern.Your sumptoms are indication of a viral flu than altitude sickness.Altitude sickness generally does not cause fever with chills but causes shortness of breath and chest tightness.I would advice you to keep yourself hydrated and take adequate rest and you will do great.I hope this helpsWish you a very healthy life ahead."},{"Patient":"My three year old son has had a fever for several days, highest 102.5, chronic vomiting, WBC of 17,000, 75% saturation in the blood (doctor mentioned something about that measuring bacteria), Ketones, protein, and blood in his urine. His Ketone levels were 80 yesterday and 15 today. He had a medical procedure several weeks ago that required his feeding tube to be extracted and Botox injected into his Pyloric muscle and dilation was also done. All tests, such as flu, strep, etc. have been done and they are all negative. Do you think he could have a Staph infection INSIDE his stomach?","Doctor":"Hi, I did review your concern. I believe you son had probably some infection. Staphyloccocal infection of stomach is generally not seen but we do see food poisoning due to staph toxin resulting form eating contaminated milk based food. It can cause fever and severe vomiting. It does not require any antibiotics and it usually reverses on its own after toxin is passed through stoolI hope this helpswish your son and your family a healthy life ahead."},{"Patient":"I previously had MRSA under both arms.  I was treated with 2 types of antibiotics, but the knots never came to a head.  I went to a surgeon, but he did not intervene as head never formed.  It feels like I am getting the knots again in the same place.  Is this possible?  Does MRSA stay in the skin?  If he does intervene surgically will this take care of the problem permanently or will it likely continue to recur?","Doctor":"Hi I did review your concern.MRSA is a robust cocci and it does stay on skin. the best preventive measure to get over mrsa is frequent hand washing after and before meeting any person with suspected MRSA. Surgical intervention for abscess or knot removal will help you in overcoming that episode but provides no guarantee against reinfection of other close by or distant nodes.I hope the answer helps.wish you all the best for future."},{"Patient":"my daughter was diagnosed with glandular fever a couple of weeks ago, she seemed to be getting better during the last week , she still sufferred from tiredness and moodiness but in the last 48 hours has had diarreah 3 times and has been sick once. i'm going to take her to the doctor tomorrow but im just a bit worries about her.

I have used a one day OTC miconazole suppository, but other than that, I don't know what else to do.  Would a natural supplement, like garlic or yogurt be worth a try as well?","Doctor":"Hello, I suppose the yeast infection is on your groin? If that's the case you can use an antifungal cream (fluconazole for example) for a couple of weeks or for at least a few days after the yeast has completely recovered. Oral treatment has some benefits and you can also use fluconazole by mouth for the same amount of time. It's better if a dermatologist diagnosed it though. I don't believe that natural supplements or any other non-pharmaceutical product would offer any help. Don't forget to keep the area clean and dry.

I went to emergency and got the suggested shots, but not the rabies shot.  We observed the cat  & it seem to be acting normal. I did get an infection in my right arm and my arm swelled about  quite a bit, but then went away. I am now experiencing some dizziness and discomfort in my head (now & then); like vertigo.  Is there any chance I could have contracted rabies, even though the cat seems calm and normal? I am 62 yrs. old, 5' 2\\", 123 lbs., in good health & I am allergic to cats (sneezing, throat itching, etc.)","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to Health Care Magic.Thanks for writing.I am Dr.Saddiq ul Abidin. I have read your question completely, I understand your concern and will try to help you in best way possible.The post Exposure Prophylaxis of rabies depend upon the degree of exposure, and the prophylactic measures may vary from simple antirabies vaccines to the use of passive immunity, in the form of anti-rabies serum or immunoglobulins, but since rabies is a potentially fatal disease and its post exposure vaccination have shown to be having almost 99.9% efficacy, so normally doctors don't recommend taking chances, so even for trivial scratches the vaccinations are suggested quite often.Also the history that, whether it was a provoked bite or spontaneously unprovoked incidence is very important, in case of stray dogs mostly. The kind of wound you inflicted is a category 2 wound, which needs rabies vaccination normally, without any need of antirabies serum. but since cat is rabies free as you have described, then need of vaccination declines. But in your case, since cat is your nieghbors, and since you know the present status of the pet, then it must be, rabies free likely. Still it would be still encouraging if cat is available, it can be examined by a vet to reconfirm whether it has any signs and symptoms of rabies?  I would also suggest you to ask your neighbor to get pet vaccinated, as it seems that he has been quite fond of keeping them.Since incubation period of rabies varied from 2 weeks to as long as 6 years so 13 weeks can't exclude its possibility but had the cat been rabid and prone to spread infections that would have meant a progressive disease and in that case it would not have been alive and healthy uptill now. The dizziness can be entirely different entity and you need to do a thorough check up for that with your local doctor. Also share all the details of previous incidence with him so that he can assess you in every regard with labs and clinical examination.I hope this answered your question.If you have more queries I am happy to answer.Otherwise rate before closing the discussionRegrads.Dr.Saddiq ul AbidinM.B.B.S(Licensed Family Physician)Resident Medicine.In future get yopurself vaccinated."},{"Patient":"Hi..I have a friend aged 23 years with height of 5'10, who gets cold, cough and headaches with pain in left side of face..When I asked him he told that he has Sinusitis and it has become incurable as per his doctor..And now if he gets a sinus attack, left side of his face will be paralyzed..He will not be able to speak even..It can only be suppressed not cured..

I have read your question completely, I understand your concern and will try to help you in best way possible.As far your friends history is suggesting, he is suffering from chronic sinusitis or recurrent sinusitis. This can be allergic or bacterial, but mostly caused by nasal septal deformities or any other pathology which interfere with drainage of bony air sinuses lading to infections. As far as pain is concerned that can occur when any division of Facial nerve or Maxillary division of Trigeminal nerve is involved on the same side due to mass lesions or viral infections. But most of these need proper evaluation and ENT consultants review, because most of such conditions are reversible, and also that a sinusitis is less likely to present like this unless there is any other other underlying abnormality exacerbating it.Your friend may need a detailed workup including complete blood picture, CRP, ESR as well as Xray Paranasla sinuses, and CT or MRI if the problem aggravates. He may need IV antibiotics if not cured with oral antibiotics but in neither case the solution is there. He just needs to consult the right person.As far as his story is suggestive, it seems your friend is in wrong hands and being cured by a wrong person who is not licensed physician, and is just arousing doubts and fears in your friend's mind, so that he should follow him repeatedly without consulting a proper ENT surgeon.I hope this answered your question.If you have more queries I am happy to answer.Otherwise rate and close the discussionRegrads.Dr.Saddiq ul AbidinM.B.B.S(Licensed Family Physician)Resident Medicine."},{"Patient":"My husband breaks out in beads of sweat no matter what he's doing.I 'm starting to thinks its more then just sweating.He is 52 in good health doesn't smoke.Lab levels are good, controlled high cholesteral and controlled thyroid problem.Weight about 175 5'9.","Doctor":"Hello, It depends upon whether this a new or an old problem.

A CT paranasal sinus is needed to confirm diagnosis as well as to rule out any cause of blockage.

It does cause an irregular reddish or pinkish ring which can change shape a bit over time a but always looks like a ring.It is not more dangerous to have ring worm around the navel.An anti fungal cream will help.  Use it for at least 2 weeks.  Fungi can be tenacious and take awhile to go away. Try to expose the area to light and air and keep it dry as much as possible.  About poison ivy:  The only thing that spreads poison ivy is the oil from the plant.  Once it is washed off with soap and water, you cannot spread it.  If poison ivy came in contact with any of your clothes, wash them with detergent and that will get rid of the oil.  If your shoes came in contact, wash/scrub them with detergent.But once the oil is gone, which only takes simple soapy washing, you cannot spread it.  However, if you did contact poison ivy and a reaction starts, it may appear to spread a bit, but that is not caused by your spreading it with your hands but rather an immune reaction to where the poison ivy oil had been.Consider treating the kitty for ring worm too if it appears infected.  Use a vet rx  rather than an anti fungal designed for humans as I don't know the dose or duration a kitten needs.I hope this helps.

The damaged nerves can not transmit the impulses to the muscles . As a result, your muscles have trouble responding to your brain resulting in weakness and muscle pains.The exact cause of Guillain-Barre syndrome isn't known. The disorder usually appears days or weeks after a respiratory or digestive tract infection. Rarely, recent surgery or immunization can trigger Guillain-Barre syndrome.Normal RBCs count: Male: 4.7 to 6.1 million cells/mcL Female: 4.2 to 5.4 million cells/mcLWhat was the indication of blood transfusion since your RBCs count was within normal range?Blood transfusion or hypothyroidism do not appear to be the cause of GB syndrome.Hope this answers your query.Wishing you best of your health."},{"Patient":"hi i had a fasting blood test and they all came back clear,but the doctor said 1 was border line wich he sadi was a liver enzyme wich was 5 to 36,he said it probably because of a viral infection i have had.so he wants me to have further blood test in 6 weeks just to fully make sure.do i need to worrry?","Doctor":"Hello,Yes it is possible that a viral infection could cause an elevation of liver enzymes.

If it is so, and the assessment of condition, apart from your headaches, for which it has been prescribed, hence the decision to decrease or continue its present dose, would lye in the domains of a psychiatrist. As far as its long term use is concerned, such medicines and other to belong to SSRI are actually meant for quite long time usages. Although these have shown to have some side effects like dizziness, dependency, Long QT syndromes ( certain heart beat abnormalities), withdrawl effects and certain drug interactions, still their use shouldn't be discontinued at your own discretion.Also regarding your query, to use stomach protection, isn't necessary along it, rather it has shown to have certain interactions and increased tendency of some skin infections in the outcomes of certain trials done for their concomitant use with Omeperazole (PPI), a stomach medicine.Your sinusitis can entirely be a different entity or can also be, on other hand, contributing to the headaches, for which you should have a detailed ENT examination and X-ray Para nasal sinuses, to diagnose it, and if proven, then it may necessitate the use of certain antibiotics, along with antihistamines and anti-inflammatory medicines for its proper management.Regards,Dr.Saddiq ul AbidinM.B.B.S(Licensed Family Physician)Resident Medicine."},{"Patient":"I am a diabetic on insulin...

Another common problem with diabetes is increased tendency to catch infections. Catching a chest infection can be one of those. Here, it would have been more appreciable if we had known any smoking history, current or past, or any history of shortness of breath, presence or absence of sputum, because each of these would decide further line of management.Currently, if your GP suggest it to be because of acid regurge, you can try taking stomach medicines including antacids and motility agents, like Omeprazole and domperidone after discussion with your GP, and if the symptoms persist, then you can proceed with further evaluation regarding a chest pathology.Along with chest X-ray, you may need to have complete blood count, ESR, CRP, as well as sputum or blood cultures. A thorough, throat and chest examination, to rule out any signs of respiratory tract infection would let your doctor decide for the use of antibiotics along with antihistamines (n anti allergics) as well need for a good anti-tussive (cough syrups).

The brief details you have shared refer to as, you have been diagnosed recently, incidentally as having hepatitis B infection while having a blood screening for your other issues.Since it was incidentally found, it means it has not given you any problem in the past, that is why it was left undiagnosed until now, and it is a good news.Hepatitis B virus is among the few causes of chronic liver disease, and currently some antiviral drugs are available in the market which are given from time to time depending upon individual cases and disease behaviors.A good thing about hepatitis B is, a low progression rate to Cirrhosis or liver damage, which occurs in less than 10 percent untreated  people. However need for a regular check up for any signs of early cirrhosis or any space occupying lesion in liver, is advisable.In your case HbeAg positive is suggesting an active disease, and if along with that if you run a Liver function test, which turns out to be raised than normal, along with a positive quantitative  PCR of Hepatitis B virus, above 200-300 ( this criteria varies in different guidelines), than this may necessitate treatment commencement with tenofovir or other antivirals. But that is a sensitive domain and needs a detailed evaluation and workup by a gastro-entrologist.As far as your concerns regarding prognosis and severity of disease are concerned, Nothing is as darker as you have perceived and their are multiple options available, but you just need to develop a close liaison to a good gastro-entrolgiost.Lastly, a family screening and vaccinations is my most important suggestion to you, which should be commenced as soon as possible.I hope this answered your question.If you have more queries I am happy to answer.

I looked behind his ears and saw that his skin looked a litttle irritated and applied it there as well. After about a week, I called his dr because they both seemed to not clear or dry up. She prescribed him nystatin, she said that it might be a yeast infection. It's been a week or more now and it is worse. It seems as if it has spread a lot in both areas. Is it the Nystatin thats making it worse, should I ask her to prescribe another product, or is it a simple fix that I am overlooking? Please help me. Also, not sure if this can help the answer but she had to do a blood culture on him and she said she has to retest because his white blood cell count is really low. She said his iron is a little low as well and he has a sickle cell trait.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome,This sounds like a frustrating situation.  The first thing that I thought of when reading your question is that your son needs to be seen in the doctor's office to truly evaluate that rash.  While it is quite reasonable to have a medication  such as nystatin prescribed over the phone, given the failure of it to clear up the rash, and that it is getting worse, and that you've tried for a week - it is time to take him in so the doctor can look at it and see what that rash truly is.Regarding whether Nystatin can make a rash worse (or cause one): the worsening of the rash may either be due to that nystatin is not the right medication to treat this rash, OR that your son is sensitive or allergic to it.At this visit the doctor can explain the significance of his low white blood count and whether this might be related to the persistence or worsening of his rash.  She will be able to tell what specific cell types of the white blood count are low.I hope this helps you.

Since you describe that the bite is not deep, then basic wound care is the first thing to do.  If the wound does not need to be closed with sutures, you can wash the wound, either with tap water or saline, flushing it out, and then cover it with a clean bandage.If you received 3 tetanus vaccines in the past (usually as a child), the wound is a clean minor wound (not a puncture wound) and you have had a tetanus shot in the past 10 years, then you do not need to have a tetanus booster.   If you never receive a \\"primary series\\" of 3 shots, or if you haven't had a tetanus shot in the last 10 years, then having one now is recommended.Now about the need for a rabies vaccine:If it is possible, ask the owner of the dog whether the dog has been immunized for rabies.  Get the name of the dog's veterinarian and contact him or her to confirm that the dog's rabies immunizations are up to date.  The dog should be quarantined (such as kept in the owner's house or fenced in yard) and observed for 10 days to make sure it doesn't show signs of rabies.If the dog gets sick during the 10-day period, a veterinarian will test it for rabies. If the dog does have rabies, you will need to get a series of rabies shots.If the dog is a stray or you can't find the owner, call the animal control agency or health department in your area. They will try to find the dog so it can be tested for rabies.If the animal control agency or health department can't find the dog that bit you, if the dog shows signs of rabies after the bite or if a test shows that the dog has rabies, it is recommended that you get a series of rabies shots.Animal control and the police should be notified and the bite reported even if you do know the owner of the dog, to help prevent future bites.Watch for signs of infection and see a doctor if there is increasing redness or a discharge/pus.  This is less likely in the bite you described as it sounds as though your bite is superficial.I hope this information helps you.  Good luck to you."},{"Patient":"i have had a cyst in my groin for 4yrs. i had it surgically removed once and it came back immediatly. it became infected again last month, i was put on antibiotics and had it drained. it opened back up 3xs. now i have a new lump  that is infected.what do i do? im tired of dealing with this!","Doctor":"Hello,Unfortunately these infected cysts need to be surgically opened and drained and you probably need to be on antibiotics.

The wind has been blowing like crazy and have been working out side a lot.  I have never had more than a drippy nose for allergies but recently I have been bothered with itchy eyes and throat. About a week now I have woken up every morning to a headache with puffy swollen eyes and earaches is this allergies or a sinus infection.","Doctor":"As both a physician and an allergy sufferer myself, I can relate to what you are experiencing! The itchy eyes and throat can definitely be from seasonal allergies. It is harder to sort out, without examining  you, whether the ear ache is from allergies or an infection.  In both cases, fluid draining down the throat (even if you don't perceive drainage) can cause pressure changes in the ear (and sometimes some fluid and air bubbles) that can cause pain.So let's look at what other symptoms sinus infections might give you to help you sort it out.  Sinus infections can cause facial and dental pain, a sensation of a bad smell (such as from bacteria), sometimes a low grade fever, copious discharge down the throat that may be discolored, nasal mucus that is thick and yellow (and not just in the morning).I would suggest a saline nasal wash, such as a nettipot, but this would not be a good idea when you are having ear pain.  Some things you may consider trying:cromolyn nasal spray - this is a very safe medication but it works best if you use it regularly to prevent allergic reactions.  In most places this is nonprescription.corticosteroid nasal sprays - may take several days to work.  Examples are Flonase (fluticasone), Qnasl (which is a dry preparation)oral antihistamine such as ceterizine (Zyrtec) or Allegra or Claritin.You may want to wash your eyes after coming in from outside with a buffered saline preparation - you can get one of these at pharmacy.  An eye wash will help wash away the pollen causing the problems and also be soothing.There are also antihistamine drop medications you can get from your doctor -these help some people.Hope this helps  you."},{"Patient":"I m having blood pressure and heart rate problems and was referred for a pacemaker.

However, surgery (nerve decompression) improves sensation in selected patients with sensory impairment and most often prevents further deterioration.Sensory loss, though generally irreversible, can often be ameliorated by simple longitudinal epineurotomy.Peripheral nerve reconstruction using denatured muscle auto-grafts may help to restore protective sensation in hands. Nerve grafts may be helpful for patients with localized nerve lesions like ulnar neuropathy.A multidisciplinary team comprising a leprologist, a neurologist, physical and occupational therapists, and a surgeon with experience in peripheral nerve surgery is needed.Hope this answers your query.Rate this answer if you are convinced.Wishing you a very good health."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am having the fever from last 2 months , if i take medicine it come down, but after some time come again, i have done urine test, lever function, typhoid, malaria , ultrasound, but everything is fine... dr. is also not be able to answer, just gave me medicine...pls tell me what are the possible cause","Doctor":"HIThanks for posting your query.

There was only thought to be one cyst but when the surgeon removed it they found several others beneath the skin, and while the flesh that was cut away was supposed to be tested, it was discarded by accident. They cut a section of flesh 5 inches long, 1 inch wide, and 1 inch deep. It healed but I have had a tender scar there ever since. Recently I had been experiencing more tenderness than usual and today I realized their was blood and a smelly discharge coming from the scar. I looked in the mirror and it looked like there is a small slit/hole where the scar is. The soonest I can get in to see my doctor is thursday.

My face, hands, feet, back, and armpitts are these areas of increased sweating, so pretty much everywehere. This worries me a lot, as i know that naturally i barely sweat at all.

This discoloration is actually harmless and reversible after discontinuing the treatment.However it appears that you have dark pigmentation (hyperpigmentation) on the skin as well as on the nipples. This could have been caused by some other problem like some hormonal imbalance.I advice you to kindly consult your treating doctor or a dermatologist for proper evaluation and to rule out adrenal insufficiency (decreased adrenal hormones) that might result in hyperpigmentation of the skin including the palm creases.Hope this answers your query.Kindly rate this answer, if you are convinced."},{"Patient":"Like 3 days ago i did a vaginal shower that ones they sale at Walgreen with vinegar and water i bought it a long time ago and i didn't  look for an expiration day.After that next day it started to hurt 2 days after i did the shower i look myself in the mirror and i saw one little pink blister,it burns every time i pee and i have alot of white discharge.Like a year ago i did a blood test for herpes and it was negative i have a new boyfriend and he did it too and he is clean.Can you please tell me if this is herpes or any infection cause by the vinegar and water shower please im really worried it could be herpes.","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HCM.I doubt it is herpes as herpes lesions usually occur in crops and are fluid filled.

If all the doses are not taken or if doses are not taken at the correct times, the vaccine may not work properly.Typhoid vaccine must be stored in the refrigerator at a temperature between 2 and 8 degrees C (35.6 and 46.4 degrees F) at all times. If the vaccine is left at room temperature, it will lose its effectiveness. Therefore, remember to replace unused vaccine in the refrigerator between doses.Each dose of the vaccine should be taken approximately 1 hour before a meal. I suggest you replace the pills with new pills as the effectiveness of those pills is questionable.As you are travelling in the near future, effective vaccination is necessary.Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi, my 8 year old daughter is suffering from klebsiella infection in tonsil for two years now. on past few months, the infection occur every three weeks.

I just went in for STD testing, could I have these two things without having an STD?  I am 31 and 135lbs 5'5\\"","Doctor":"Dear Patient,   As you mentioned,you have been under an extreme amount of stress which can disturb the normal flora in vagina. When the normal vaginal flora is declined, pathological bacteria can rapidly grow in vagina and remove slowly  normal vaginal flora and causes bacterial vaginosis. And your Bartholin cyst can be due to accumulation of fluid due to obstruction of the opening of the  Bartholin gland. This can be due to an infection caused by E.Coli or sexually transmitted like Chlamydia, gonorrhoea or even secondary to BV. Going back to your question, yes , your bacterial  vaginosis can be non STD related.    However, It is good that you went for STD testing and it will help to screen sexually transmitted infections.  Also your sugar level has to be monitored because diseases like  diabetes mellitus can exacerbate your condition. I strongly recommend you to see a Gynaecologist and her or she can be the best person to help you in your situation.  Your gynaecologist will perform a pelvic exam and take vaginal secretions for testing. He or she may prescribe necessary antibiotics like Clindamycin, Metronidazole to eradicate the infection and surgical drainage may be needed for treating the Bartholin cyst.

I have had a small swelling on the left side close to the knot.","Doctor":"Hello,      I understand your concern for your health and i will try my best to solve your query.      I would like to suggest you to do daily dressing with savlon and silver sulphadiazene ointment. Also take antibiotic course for at least 5 to 7 days. Also take vitamin C tablets 2 times a day, which will help in healing process. Keep the stitched area clean and dry always.      If you find pus coming out of any of the stitches or that swelling area at any point of time, immediately go to the surgeon to drain all the pus and re dressing it and take higher antibiotics course for 7 days again. Don't worry, stitches will be dissolved within 7 to 10 days and stitched area will be healed properly.      Hope this answers your question and let me know if you have any further queries, i will be obliged to guide you properly."},{"Patient":"Hi. My two daughters have both been diagnosed with hand foot and mouth> They developed symptoms and stayed away from school for the week just be safe. This was two and a half weeks ago. I have just noticed in the bath that they both have quite a lot of very tiny white spots on the soles of their feet, under some toes and in the palms of their hands. Could this be the final stages of the illness or something else? Many thanks.","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicThe tiny lesions are related to the infection. They should resolve on their own.It is possible that they may be small areas of scar tissue from the 'bumps' that would have been present in the hand foot and mouth disease.After 3 weeks, they should no longer be contagious.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi Dr, My palms and soles are itchy and swollen, It paints when i walk. now its combined with sore throat, I have red patches on my both palms, I have pain in my fingers as well.

But the problem still persist, does anyone  have any idea what is it ?","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicIt is is possible that it is a type of eczema possibly dyshidrotic eczema which can affect the palms and soles though there are also other causes.It may be affected by allergens so you can consider an allergy test to try and determine if there are any particular irritants that cause your reaction.In addition to avoiding these allergens, the use of topical steroids and oral medication may also be needed.You may want to consider a dermatologist.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi. I was diagnosed with asthma last fall (I assume quite mild). I am on a symbicourt inhaler. A few weeks ago I had a head cold. IT went away in about a week, and for a week I was fine. Then one week later, I woke up with a very sore throat, went to the walk-in clinic and got an antibiotic for strep (although no one has called me back to confirm that the swab actually showed strep). I am coughing non-stop. It feels like it is productive, but then my chest feels just as full after I cough. I have been having some sleep apnea issues since this all started. My throat is not sore, but my voice is rough and raw-sounding. It's hardly worth the effort to talk. I am overweight, but otherwise healthy. I eat well and (up until the last few weeks) exercise regularly (both aerobic and weight bearing). I am exhausted from coughing. I just want my voice back, and to stop coughing.","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicBecause you are asthmatic, your asthmatic control needs to be assessed first to determine if this is the cause of your persistent coughing.You may need a short course of oral steroids and may also need to be nebulised but this can be assessed by your doctor.Post nasal drip is also a very common cause of coughing and change in voice. Some persons may not be aware of the drip.It is common is asthmatics.The use of topical steroid nasal sprays and antihistamines is recommended.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"It has been three weeks and my knuckle wound has not healed.

Hopefully this medication will treat you and get rid of all the virus in your blood. Of course, you should know this viral infection is spread via blood, saliva, vaginal secretions, breastmilk, and even tears.You will not have a problem getting married. But when engaging in sexual activities you should use protection at all times, and advise your partner to get vaccinated against hepatitis B before you engage in such activities so that they dont get infected. Im not sure if you are female or male, but if you are a female then when having children, you need to keep in mind that there is a high chance to transmit the hepatitis infection to your children. For this reason, right after birth, the child is vaccinated for hepatitis B, and also given Immunoglobulins against the virus (HBIG, hepatitis B immune globulin). These are given by your doctor to prevent the infection from occuring in your child. Of course you have to tell this to your doctor so they know about your infection and so they can take the appropriate measures.Also the hepatitis B infection can increase certain health risks for the liver. Try to abstain from drinking alcohol, and try to take as few medications as possible or drugs that can harm the liver. Also there is increased risk of liver cancer.

If untreated, symptoms may progress to joint pains, severe headaches. Your son is not experiencing any of these symptoms. I would not be worried about Lyme disease.The type of tick that transmits Lyme disease must feed for at least 36 hours before transmission of the spirochete, causing infection.

I recently started working out running on the treadmill could this have caused my inflammation?","Doctor":"Hello, this is Dr. Gidoiu,Coccobacilli means spherical bacteria. You have an infection, and most likely your doctor prescribed you some antibiotics. In which location are you having inflammation?No, running on the treadmill itself cannot cause you the inflammation. But there are associated risks in a public gym. I would advise to be more hygienic when washing in the public showers at the gym, use clean towels to clean yourself of sweat or after showering. The only kind of inflammation that running on the treadmill can give you is inflammation associated with improper exercise, due to muscle strain, or tendon strain. But this would not include bacterial infection. I think you are making a wrong connection between the infection and the treadmill."},{"Patient":"I am suffering fever and cough from last one week and underwent CBP, CUE, WIDAL and MP all the tests are normal except for Pus Cell count in CUE which is 18-20 /hpf.

I have read your question completely, I understand your concern and will try to help you in best way possible.The post Exposure Prophylaxis of rabies depend upon the degree of exposure, and the prophylactic measures may vary from simple antirabies vaccines to the use of passive immunity, in the form of anti-rabies serum or immunoglobulins, but since rabies is a potentially fatal disease and its post exposure vaccination have shown to be having almost 99.9% efficacy, so normally doctors don't recommend taking chances, so even for trivial scratches the vaccinations are suggested quite often.But in your case, since dog is well vaccinated, and since you know the vaccination status of the dog, then it must be, a pet dog likely. So it would be still encouraging if you reconfirm the exact booster dosages and whether the vaccines schedule was followed, as per protocol. If dog is available, it can be examined by a vet to reconfirm whether it has any signs and symptoms of rabies? Also the history that, whether it was a provoked bite or spontaneously unprovoked incidence is very important, in case of stray dogs mostly. The kind of wound you inflicted is a category 2 wound, which needs rabies vaccination normally, without any need of antirabies serum. but since dog is well vaccinated as you have described,t hen need of vaccination declines. I would still suggest you, that even if there is a little of ambiguity, regarding the dogs status, you can start anti rabies vaccination according to regular schedule of day 0,3,7 and 21. And meanwhile god can be kept under monitoring. If the dog doesn't show any kind of symptoms in 10 days, then the vaccination can be stopped.I hope this answered your question.If you have more queries I am happy to answer.Otherwise rate and close the discussionRegrads.Dr.Saddiq ul AbidinM.B.B.S (Licensed Family Physician)Resident Medicine."},{"Patient":"My father is 80 yrs old had a heart attack and open heart 2 yrs ago his Dr said his heart is functioning at 30 to 35 % he also has copd asthma and diabetes what are his options and his life expectancy?

I am Dr. Saddiq ul abidin. I have your question completely, I understand your concern and i will try to help you in best way possible.For UTI to be labelled on a urinalysis, the most significant finding is the presence of pus cells or WBC, in more than 5-8 quantity/HPF, though a clear cut demarcation has not been drawn, because associated history of burning micturation and urinary symptoms like urgency, frequency and fever are also given due importance. Other associated findings are leukocyte esterase to be positive, while in certain nitrogen fixing bacteria, presence of nitrite may also be a clue. In severe UTI's or the ones caused by stones or obstructive uropathies, RBC may also be significantly raised. The presence of bacteria alone, indicate contamination of the sample mostly.The detailed analysis report which you have shared is suggesting however the presence of an acidic urine. For which i would have suggested you, the use of some alkylating agent like Citrosoda sachet twice daily for at least five days, if you were my patient.If you are experiencing the symptoms like the ones i have mentioned above, you can however have a urine culture to be sure and then treat the infection if the cultures turn out to be positive, and you can let your treating physician chose by the sensitivity spectrum according to the culture if positive.I hope this answered your question, If you have more queries, i am happy to answer, otherwise rate before closing the discussion.

Because each one of them carries different sensitivity and specificity.However since history is so suggestive so, the need for eradication regimen for H. pylori is mandatory.Many regimens have been devised over the years based on different guidelines and all of them have shown to be effective.

A 14 days therapy has been shown to have a higher eradication rate.I would also advise you to avoid taking spicy foods or irritants of stomach mucosa like alcohol, carbonated drinks, high caffeine hot beverages and avoid eating too much.

I have read your question completely, I understand your concern and will try to help you in best way possible.Normally generalized body aches are associated with majority if febrile illnesses, but polyarthralgias (involvement of multiple joints) is suggestive of many other possibilities which need to be ruled out. Many rheumatological diseases can present themselves, with such pattern and mostly their screening tests are ESR or CRP. If they are found to be raised then further evaluation with ANA, anticcp, RA factor or other specific antibodies is among few of the usual next steps of evaluation.Many viral illnesses may present with such prodromal symptoms. You also need to rule out involvement of heart, as some diseases present with joint pains and fever and may also involve heart valves. For such, Blood cultures and a 2D ECHO after a detailed auscultation of heart by your doctor would be appropriate, if symptoms worsen. RFTs would essentially rule out any such disorder which involves kidneys. Uric acid levels could also be included as a part of workup, if all others are not suggestive.In any case, you need to visit your doctor, if symptoms persist, for a detailed check up and labs screening. But before visiting i would recommend you to do a fever charting on a mercury thermometer to confirm, is it feverish feeling? or proper febrile illness?, because that would be important for your doctor to know.

Pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine secreting tumor which presents with high blood pressure, headaches palpitations and sweating. Negative test results rule out phechromacytoma as the cause of hypertension. Low metanephrines in the urine indicates adrenal glands are producing lower levels of catecholamine hormones which might be normal feedback to hypertension. On the other hand some studies show low levels of metanephrines may indicate diabetes or pre-diabetic state.You should check blood glucose test to rule out diabetes as well.I hope the above information will be helpful for you. Please, feel free to ask me if there is anything else you need to know. Thank you,Malik Amonov MD"},{"Patient":"My (75 year old) mother in law had a partial knee replacement in July 2014, and her would still has an opening and is not healing.

What should we do?","Doctor":"Hello dear,Thank you for your contact to health care magic.I read and understand your concern.

Don't be scared . This is just infection of throat. Throat infection could be due to Viral or bacterial Infection.     Most of the viral infection will last for 2-3 days and shall subside on its own. Till then I would recommend her to do Salt water gargling 3-4 times a day, drink hot water, eat less oily food and avoid non veg food .     For pains hse can take Tyelenol . But if the symptoms persists even after 2 days its better she consult a doctor as there is a high chance in that case for the infection to be Bacterial.    For bacterial infection the doctor will advise a test called Throat swab Culture sensitivity which will tell what is the right antibiotic for her . Once the antibiotic is started everything will subside in 2-3 days . Hope this information was useful to you. Any clarifications feel free to ask ."},{"Patient":"Hello, my 7 yr. old wets the bed. And I was wondering with her bed being wet on so many times does that cause scabies to be in the bed and then will they bite her. she has had a rash for a good while now and I thought it was an allergic reaction to a detergent I was using. so i changed to a more genteler detergent but her symtoms are still around. it is on her stomach, back, neck, elbow increases, bottom, and hand areas. Please help me does she have scabies?","Doctor":"hi,Scabies is a contagious skin disease cause by a tiny  mite Sarcoptes scabiei which is invisible to naked eye.It characteristically  burrows  the skin causing an allergic response. It affects  area of the finger webs, feet, ventral wrists, elbows, back, buttocks, and external genitals. It causes itching and rashes.Kindly consult a dermatologist regarding the treatment with permethrin topical solution or Ivermectin.However, it may not be scabies, it may be a bed bug biting her, so kindly wash the bedding in hot water and disinfect it and keep the bed out in the sun before using it again.Thanks"},{"Patient":"My sister-in-law had been sick with flu symptoms this past week. She was admitted to a hospital yesterday and the doctor said the flu virus attacked her heart causing fluid retention and very high blood pressure with shortness of breath. I have never heard of this. Is she going to be OK?","Doctor":"Hi. I am Dr. Saddiq. First of all i woulds like to wish a healthy recovery for your sister in law. Your concerns regarding the disease progression and some insight into it is quite relevant.Some diseases, caused by certain bacteria, which initially present with flu and sore throat can involve heart or kidney by different disease mechanisms. Judging by the kind of brief symptoms, you have mentioned, it appears as if, your sister in law has suffered from such disease, which may have involved her heart valves and lead to inadequate pumping of heart forwards and hence backward pooling or accumulation of fluids in the lungs as well as in the rest of the body. Here it would have been more appropriate if we had known the status of her heart, the reports of 2-D echo, Chest radio-graphs, Blood cultures, Kidney function tests to guide you further. Regarding her prognosis and the course of actions, Offcourse she needs an indoor hospitalization and a critical care management which may involve removing the extra water to relieve her shortness of breath with the drugs which take out extra water by increased urination along with intravenous antibiotics and regular monitoring and occasional oxygen assistance along with pharmacological measures to relieve stress off her heart. Hoping her a rapid recovery. Thanks for trusting in HCM.

KINDLY TELL ME THIS <15 IU/ML MEANS NEGATIVE HCV OR STILL SHE IS INFECTED WITH HCV VIRUS. PLZ TELL ME THAT TREATMENT WAS SUCCESSFUL OR NOT AND SHE WILL HAV ANOTHER PROBLEM IN FUTURE BECAUSE OF THIS?","Doctor":"Hi! I am Dr. Saddiq and i would like to look into your concerns. I would briefly describe the course of actions from this point onwards.1. Yours wife's PCR report is suggestive as if it was a qualitative PCR analysis and not that quantitative one, because for qualitative ones they have a certain cut off value and its testing limitations down to a certain viral load, which in this case was less than 15 IU/ml. That tells us that her viral load was so less (or either negative) to be detected in the test. in any case, briefly speaking she has responded well to treatment which is a good news.2. The next step would be having a quantitative PCR every six months for one year, and then yearly for three years to see for a sustained virological response (SVR). If it stayed negative, no action is suggested.3. If it becomes positive, upto a certain viral load, than that would be called as treatment relapse, and in such case either repetition of whole peg interferon therapy for another six months is recommended or use of new antiviral drugs, which were in pipeline previously and now been recommended by different drug authorities ti b used in certain countries. The one in use for genotype 3 is Tab.Sibasfovir. If i were your wives physician, then God forbid if in the case of a relapse, I would have opted for Sibasfovir instead of a second course of interferon as it has been shown to have more effectiveness then the previous one. It is recommended as 400mg tab. once daily for six months, alongwith the usual dose of Ribavirin."},{"Patient":"I have a cold, just a simple common cold.

I just read through your question.Typically, cold sores are caused by viruses that lay dormant in the body, sometimes even for years. If he got a cold sore, it is most likley because he has been expoesed to cold sore viruses in the past, and not because he kissed you."},{"Patient":"My 9 yr old daughter experienced what we believe to be stomach flu  3 weeks ago, it started with stomach pain then vomiting/ dry heaving for 12 hrs then she felt better.

So I sprayed an awful lot of FDS spray, and also some body spray on it.  As has happened before about a year ago when I did this and sprayed a lot of the spray in very close proximity to my vagina I experienced the beginning signs of a yeast infection but I could not get to the store right away to buy the yeast infection kit.  I did however have some of the anti-itch cream left over that came with a kit I'd bought about 6 months prior.  So I began to use it, and I will admit to using it a lot more than it says you are allowed to as the yeast infection itch tends to really bother me.  I also scratched it a lot to the point where my vulva became red and swollen and also a tiny bump appeared. At first I noticed one but two more as I continued scratching appeared in the next 12hrs.  They were all very small, and two of them were about 5 millimeters apart from eachother and the third was very tiny and didn't seem to itch that bad and was located at the very bottom of my vaginal area. The time before when I used too much of the spray a year ago, I had also noticed a bump but this time three appeared and I had been scratching a lot more and also waited to use the medicine this time.I got concerned and tried to pop them, when I tried it was very hard and I had to eventually use a needle to do it, and small amount of blood came out, and the area was very irritated at this point, but the bump was basically still there.  The next day I tried again with my hand to pop it, and again a small amount of blood came out, and it made a bit of a popping sound and fluid which seemed to be clear but also slightly yellowish came out. The other two bumps popped fairly easily only no blood (I hadn't used the needle) and clear/but slightly yellowish fluid came out.  Kind of like what comes out when I squeeze a pimple on my face after the white stuff come out...that is the best way to describe it.   Once I began taking the yeast infection medicine I began to feel better at about the same time I always do when I take yeast infection medicine, and the yeast infection seemed to clear up just fine.  My concern is though about the bumps!  Is this normal or could it be a sign or herpes or some other disease?  Did they appear because I scratched and rubbed so persistently or were they due to a reaction from the FDS and body spray sprayed so close to my vagina?  I've been very worried that perhaps it's a disease as I've done this to myself twice now.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.1. There is a possibility of a reaction to the repeated usage of the yeast kit. 2. This depends on what medicines are used. Clotrimoxazole is the most common and repeated use causes a reaction. 3. There is a possibility of a slight allergic reaction or perhaps an irritation caused by excess spraying of the deodorants. 4. The fact that a lot of scratching occurred, which is enough to cause an inflammation of the area. For example, if you were to scratch your arm, furiously, again and again, the same reaction would occur except that the vulva is more sensitive. This is a fact. READ CAREFULLY.5. You are safe from herpes. Herpes presents as snake-like eruptions, and not at all the bumps you are describing. Also, there has been no sexual contact as described by you with a partner without protection. So you can really feel calm and reassured that you are 100% safe from herpes. Take these pills carefully now. Read very carefully. 1. Amoxycillin with clavulanic acid pills once after breakfast and dinner for 3 days2. Levocetirizine tablets 2 times a day to stop itching and scratching3. Mupirocin cream applied thrice a day for 7 days 4. Lactobacillus tablets as a \\"tonic\\" This is the best treatment for you. I would advise you to take pics (only of the affected areas) with a standard cam and post them if you really want to be sure. It's not required but it's your choice.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Neel Kudchadkar"},{"Patient":"I have had strep for three months 4 different antibiotics has not taken care of it.

I cough a lot, last night I coughed so I vomited several times. I have been to the doctor who says it's a virus. But many around me have been suffering from pneumonia. Could it be that I have? Was the doctor and took the CRP, the fast variant. It showed the 40 but the physician is not high enough to get antibiotics ... I can not stand it! It does not get better, only worse. Should I apply for a new doctor and get another opinion?","Doctor":"Hi there, Thanks for your faith in health care magic, Your symptoms like fever and cough for quite few days is highly suggestive of a respiratory tract infection, the possibility varies between upper to lower, though as you mentioned that you have had contact with people having pneumonia so it a possibility of contracting the same does exist, though for pneumonia the cough has to be productive and the sputum is likely to be pale yellow to greenish suggesting infective etiology, but presence of fever for this many days does indicate the use of antibiotics, and CRP levels are not criteria for antibiotics, but the fever is. presence of vomiting also rises possiblity of tonsillitis or pharyngitis which may cause throat irritation and induce vomiting. I would also like to know that whether you experience wheezy breathing or any shortness of breath or not? as it may suggest involvement of your airways, in any case the use of a broad spectrum antibiotic which has its spectrum ranging from upper to lower respiratory tract may help. if you were my patient i would have recomended you Azithromycin 250mg twice daily for 5 days, or if you are allergic to macrolides then i would have suggested moxifloxacin 400mg once daily for 5 days along with an antipyretic for your fever, an anti allergic or anti histamine like Loratidine 10mg twice daily for 5 days as well as an anti-tusive/ expectorant syrup for your cough and discomfort is recommended. Though changing your treating physician is highly indicated along with a detailed work up involving, Complete blood picture along with CRP and ESR, and a chest Xray is highly recommended, also a detailed examination of your chest with a stethoscope to look for ronchi, wheezes or crepitations along with a detailed throat examination for tonsillitis and pharyngitis is mandatory.

I would rather appreciate you for a more concise and detailed note of your history. However, I would have preferred to know the bilirubin levels though, as well as any associated symptoms like itching, decreased appetite or vomiting you experience along with increased levels of bilirubin as jaundice is a symptom which is basically the rise of the yellowish pigments (bilirubin in your body) which are normally converted by liver in soluble forms and excreted into your gut to be excreted out of your body with the stools. The first such incidence of its rise which you experienced in your neonatal life iwhich resolved itself is a type called physiological jaundice and it is not considered to be a disease so you need not to worry about that, but the second incidence in your adolesence might be because of acute hepatitis which in majority of cases is viral. but its recurrence is a bigger concern for me as it needs a detailed evaluation to rule out any other cause of chronic liver disease. Though such higher levels of ALT are usually present in Hepatitis A or E which resolves by itself between 1-2 weeks approximately. Your GGT levels indicate around 5 times of the normal levels of your age group which is suggestive of intrahepatic cholestasis or inflammatory hepatitis again favoring an acute inflammatory cause which is likely viral mostly and is water born disease with self remission. If these levels were as higher as 10-30 times we would have suspected any obstruction of bilirubin outflow (aka biliary tract diseases) which are unlikely in your case. Also that there are some diseases which interfere in conversion of insoluble blirubin into soluble ones or in the excretion inside liver cells due to enzyme deficiencies, which when present or detected in adolescence or afterwards is Gilberts disease in most of the cases which needs monitoring only along with symptomatic care with no long term treatment need. If i were your physician i would have ordered viral serologies for hepatitis, along with an ultrasound for liver size and structure as well as outflow tracts from liver and their patency, along with an albumin globulin ratios. I would also have been interested to know synthetic functions of your liver by monitoring INR to see for any need of Vitamin K supplementation. The ideal treatment is rest, Fluids, Hydration, anti Emetics and motility agents like domperidone for vomitings and associated symptoms. Also that if you were experiencing and symptoms of itching, decreased intake, severe vomitings or drowsiness i would have wanted to start bile binding drugs like chlestyramines and ursodecholic acids to make the extra bilirubin soluble and ready for excretion. If you experience any active bleeding or black stools, immediately consult a tertiary care hospital. I were you i would have arranged consultation with a gastro-entrologist too."},{"Patient":"our daughter who is 2yrs old was stung by a bee, yesterday, i took the stinger out almost immediatley, last night she was getting the start of a fever, my wife took her to the doctors this morning & the doctor put her on antibiotics for the infection, at the time she had a temp reading of 38.8. gave her nurofen and antibiotics at 11am with no change in temp until her next dosage at 3pm, her temp came down to 37.7 her temp was again taken at 6.30pm and it was up to 38. now she is asleep, but we are worried about her high temp????","Doctor":"HIThanks for posting your query.

I normally drink several glasses of red wine with dinner and more on the weekends. Is it ok to have the red wine with the stents & medication?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HealthcareMagic,I read your question carefully and I understand your concern.Drinking a glass of wine after heart attack and stent implantation may reduce the risk of re-stenosis. But you should wait at least 1 month after heart attack and can start drinking low amounts of alcohol. High amount of alcohol is associated atherosclerosis and coronary artery diseases. Alcohol may interact with your medications such as nitroglycerin, isosorbide dinitrate or other medications. Your medication list should be reviewed by your doctor for possible interaction with alcohol. I hope the above information will be helpful for you.

The infectivity and transmission mode may differ between pathogens though. Pseudomonas in particular can be transmitted by touching surfaces exposed to it, like the patient's body or objects the patient handled. What you can do is to make sure there is clean air in the room, use gloves and avoide unnecessary contact with the patient and any object. Washing your hands afterwards is very important.Pseudomonas infections can be difficult to treat so you've got to take the aforementioned measures.

The laboratory data you've provided are not sufficient to judge that. The hepatitis is considered chronic when the HBsAg is present for more than 6 months. Other markers can be used though to determine the diagnosis indirectly.Regarding treatment of chronic hepatitis, it depends on whether it is active or not. The serum transaminases and viral load (HBV-DNA) are crucial information to decide treatment initiation. Your diet has nothing to do with the outcome, so since you've no symptoms or obvious disease activity, there is no dietary change that you should try.You can contact me again, if you'd like more information about your condition or would like to discuss the results you're awaiting.

Influenza may cause anything between a mild disease with few symptoms to a debilitating disease which could rarely be fatal. Blood in the sputum is not a good sign and pneumonia has to be excluded.Bacterial pneumonia is another concern because of the fever and the blood. Clinical examination and a chest X-ray may confirm or exclude it. Antibiotic treatment is warranted in bacterial pneumonia.Cancer is rarely a concern but it is possible when the patient (particularly a smoker) spits out blood. Radiological tests are very important.Finally, other viral infections may present with the same symptoms and no treatment is required because there is none and they are self limiting conditions.Less common causes may apply to you, but they are much rarer to consider now.I hope I've helped!Best wishes for a speedy recovery!"},{"Patient":"A few years ago I got the typhoid fever shot because I was going to be traveling to some poorer countries. 1 month after I had the shot, I went on vacation and became violently ill.

Does this mean I can get typhoid fever again (do I need to be vaccinated again?)","Doctor":"Hello,first of all, the vaccine does not confer 100% protection, so getting sick cannot be excluded.The diagnosis of typhoid fever is not based on a positive H and O because this test is considered obsolete. And the reason is that a patient may have other pathogens that cross-react and give positive results, so an overdiagnosis of typhoid fever would occur if we relied on this test only.The most accurate way to establish the diagnosis is by culturing the organism. Stool cultures is the most feasible strategy but bone marrow specimen can be used as well.The vaccine efficacy is not very well studied but it can be about 70%. It declines rapidly with time. Three years after vaccination it's supposed to be lower than 50%. If this was typhoid fever indeed then this acts as a booster for your immune system. So if you're going to travel again in the future then perhaps you should receive vaccination again, particularly if more than a couple of years have passed since the last vaccination.Kind Regards!"},{"Patient":"Hi i pricked my thumb with a needle after using the needle on my little cousin it was a hormone injectionim just woundering will it harm me only a little blood came out i put it under water straight away then used an anti wipe on it just to make sure","Doctor":"Hello,if your cousin suffers from infectious hepatitis or HIV then there is a risk of contracting them.

It could be related to physical activity, anxiety, a salty meal or too much caffeine intake. Anyway, I would recommend having some rest and taking a cup of lemon juice. If high blood pressure values persist in the next days, I would recommend increasing the dose of Micardis or add new drugs to your therapy, in order to help maintain your blood pressure values under control.

It could be a prolapsed intervertabral disc applying pressure on a nerve root, as you've implied in your question but I can't confirm or exclude it. A good clinical examination and radiological tests (at least an X-ray of the lumbar spine) are needed.Continuing abdominal pain after treating the stomach is a good reason to investigate the gallbladder, if you haven't done so already.

Part of the pancreas is destroyed and its remnants create a friendly environment for pathogens. Many doctors would prescribe antibiotics even before an infection is documented, as a preventive measure.I can't tell if this is the infection your brother has - obviously. His doctors have test results in their hands and should know better. Sometimes acute pancreatitis is attributed to an inflammed gallbladder.

The stitches had been removed in mid December but the site opened yesterday 2/3/15 and CSF is coming out of her head. She had been in home hospice and we brought her into our local hospice facility. My wife does not want to go through another major surgery and the doctor here feels that he could stitch up the hole to keep the CSF from dripping and send her back home. I was worried that the open wound would cause her to contract meningitis. The doctor at hospice feels that is a low probability.

You need to have the viral load measured before treatment is started, to verify that you do actually have the virus and to be sure it comes down with the treatment. There are medicines to treat hepatitis B. Presumably your doctor is just gathering the right information about your condition before he starts the treatment. This is standard. The delay in starting treatment while waiting for tests to come back will not have any serious consequence.

I also began using fungi cure to the bikini area, only to watch the hair return.  how do i know if i have a staff infection?","Doctor":"The only way to identify a staph infection is to take a culture from the affected area and see if the bacteria grow out. Staph infection on the skin can present in many different ways, so you can't tell by just looking at it. You could get an abscess or a pimple-like lesion, or redness and tenderness of the skin, or a sore. Such lesions could be caused by other bacteria besides staph. If you suspect you might have a bacterial infection, be sure to keep it clean and you can try antibiotic ointment. If it is becoming an obvious abscess, or a cellulitis where the skin gets red, inflamed, and hot to touch, that could indicate an infection that needs treatment. In that case you should see your doctor for the appropriate treatment.

I tend to get stomach infections easily if i eat out etc. Usually my doc prescribes antibiotics which help in curing this. This time, when I got a stomach infection, along with antibiotics (for 5 days) I was also given Meftal-spas(antispasmodic). On the 3rd day of the dose, I also got my periods. And from the next day I got a lot of pain/spasms in the stomach and scanty periods. Normally my periods are normal and not scanty and I don’t get much pain etc. I somehow feel that Meftal spas caused /interfered with my periods. I vaguely remember a similar thing happened some 4-5 years back wherein I was given something for stomach bug similar to meftal spas but it caused more pain. Unfortunately I do not remember the drug name. But I remember the doc that time mentioning that was the culprit as it was a strong medicine. Anyway I stopped the last 2 doses of meftal spas and now those pains are gone. But I just wanted to know if the Meftal spas could have caused the problem.","Doctor":"Hi my dear, I have gone through your medical history carefully and understood your concerns. Meftal spas is containing the active ingredient mephenamic acid a pain killer and anti-inflammatory medication used to treat abdominal spasms too. You are reporting to be taking a course of antibiotics for stomach infection. The stomach pain you felt once you got your periods was related to uterine spasms. Meftal spas will help reduce these spasms too. As you were taking antibiotics, they might have altered your intestinal flora, causing dysbacteriosis which itself will cause further stomach pain and bloating. Probiotics are advised to start to normalize your intestinal flora and improve the symptoms.

Feeling like having very tiny parasite in your feet, body, under and around your arm pits might be due to infectious skin parasites like mites, lice or even worms. Further evaluation by dermatologist is recommended especially if you are also having skin lesions. As you are reporting to have tingling and burning sensation in your hands and feet, then, they are related to neurological problems. Further examination by neurologist is advised together with running MRI of spinal cord to rule out related damages. For the moment, I can only advise to keep a good personal hygiene and get further consultations.

Hospitals usually have a standard procedure to follow when a person gets a needle stick. They can advise you on what to do. In the meantime, clean the area that you think was pricked and be very careful in the future.

Try to corelate any incidences where you have come in contact with any particular chemical or drug in the past few days.If you have, you can take Tab Cetzine 10 mg twice daily for three days.Herpetic whitlow occurs due to exposure to a virus called herpes simplex 1 which usually causes oral lesions during fever. These are also called fever blisters.If you have had fever recently and if you have had fever blisters,then there is a chance of you getting herpes lesions on your hands due to direct contact.I suggest you get a confirmation of diagnosis by a skin specialist.

Hi, I am a 20 years old female. I have had a painless lump or swollen lymph node that has been in my neck for six 6 months now since December 2010 that can only be felt, but not seen. The lymph node is no bigger than the size of a half a dime and feels like a swollen kidney bean that keeps changing in size from small to big and then smaller again, but it never fully goes away. In terms of texture I can't tell if its firm, soft or hard. It's hard to tell. Anyway, I finally went to my doctor in early April 2011 to get it checked out and he put me on a weeks worth of antibiotics, and prescribed me some allergy and asthma medication. He also did a chest X-ray and blood test that came back normal. When I went back to my doctor he said that the lymph node had shrunk and that was a good sign and that it might have really been an infection. So he told me to observe it for a month and come back to check it out and if its still there he will send me for a biopsy. So far the lymph node is STILL there and it feels like it enlarged back a little, but that might be because I keep picking at it from worrying so much. So far I don't have any symptoms of fevers, night sweats, fatigue, persistent itching, or unexplained weight loss, in fact I gained ALOT of weight from anxiety and stress eating from the fear of this being lymphoma or some other cancer. Lastly, I think its in the posterior triangle area of my neck not sure of diagram of lymph nodes. Is it normal for a lymph node to be swollen for 6 months?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query at HCM.I understand your concern and situation.You are having chronic lymphadenitis. Lymphadenitis occurs when the glands become enlarged by swelling (inflammation), often in response to bacteria, viruses, or fungi. The swollen glands are usually found near the site of an infection, tumor, or inflammation.Prompt treatment with antibiotics usually leads to a complete recovery. It may take weeks, or even months, for swelling to disappear. Sometimes it is seen that lymph nodes respond to treatment but with recurring throat infection there is changing sizes. You can get evaluation done by ultrasound guided FNAC or biopsy for AFB, culture sensitivity test for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, cytology. This will clear your doubts.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi I was diagnosed with ethmoid sinusitis disease. Why is disease attached to diagnosis? The ENT put me on an antibiotic called cefdinir 300 mg. Is this the correct type of antibiotic that i should be on? The doctor feels that if it doesnt help come back and will talk. Mean while if been back and fourth 4 times and the problem hasnt gone away. Ive had Ct scan and MRI and Doctor doesnt think there is a problem even though both CT and  MRI both say its mild to moderate ethmoid sinusitus disease. Every day I have a headache and pressure by eyes,nose etc.. Please write back and let me know what I should be doing.","Doctor":"hi,Welcome to health care magic,Sinusitis can be treated with medicines like antibiotics, decongestant, antihistamines and anti inflammatory drugs. And yes all your pain over head and pressure by eyes,nose is most likely due to ethmoid sinusitis. Surgery is not a must for everyone. But if sinusitis does not reduce with conservative medicines ,and if sinusitis is recurring very frequently, may be 3 episodes in 6 months then we advise for surgery. And if the sinusitis is associated with nasal poylp, nasal mass, fungal sinusitis then also surgery is a must. Surgery for sinusitis is a endoscopic surgery. In this surgery mainly we clear the sinuses and provide good ventilation for the sinuses. We do have to cut the soft tissue, debride, drain and then clear the sinuses. It's a day care procedure, patient can go home the same day. Once the surgery is done,, there are very less chances for sinusitis to recur. And yes the operated area is treated as problematic area until and otherwise you are undergoing second surgery. In my opinion if this is your first episode of sinusitis then you can wait and watch. If you are a chronic patient of sinusitis then I suggest you choose surgery. Hope this information will be helpful.

Specifically, my cat that I just had to put down had a mouth wound for some time and has been on antibiotics, but still had foul smelling drool/pus coming from his mouth.  Then his tongue started turning black this past week and the Vet said gangrene had developed. The cat would shake his head at times while I was trying to feed him and I know this mucus may have gotten in my eye or lip or a scratch on my hand more than once.

Is this normal when you have glandular fever? Its not aids or somthing i would have contracted via sex? I apparently had a very inflamed liver due to the glandular fever. Thanks","Doctor":"If you truly have hepatitis C, it was just coincidence it was diagnosed at the same time as the glandular fever, not a cause or a result. You probably have had it all along, and your doctor did some tests to diagnose the glandular fever and found some abnormalities suggesting liver inflammation, which then caused him/her to check you for hepatitis C. It could have been there awhile as it often causes few symptoms. People go for years without noticing anything while it silently progresses into liver cirrhosis over decades. This is not AIDS and hepatitis C is rarely contracted via sex. It most often occurs with transfusions of blood or blood products, or from sharing needles to inject drugs. Glandular fever can also cause inflamed liver, but if hepatitis C has definitely been diagnosed, you need to get it treated, even if the liver inflammation from the glandular fever got better. Hepatitis C can cause low-grade inflammation for decades which slowly turns into liver damage. There are now some good treatments with a high cure rate that have few side effects. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I have been diagnosed with Diverticultis in MAY; took antibiotics thought I was getting better; told last night that I have another infection.  First 2 tests were from CT (contrast) and blood count. THIS TIME CT (no contrast and bloodwork ok).  HOw is this possible? My left side feels like needles in it!","Doctor":"Diverticulitis is a condition that can reoccur, and must be treated each time it happens. Diverticulosis is a common condition where there are a lot of \\"outpouchings\\" along the large intestine- kind of like a bunch of little appendixes. When one of these gets inflamed or plugged up, it can cause an infection that requires antibiotics. You can reduce the recurrence of infections by avoiding foods like nuts and seeds that can get caught in the pouches and create infections. You also want to avoid constipation as that can make the situation worse. Drink lots of fluids. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"A few days ago I had, at least I think I had, a very painful hemorrhoid. I first felt it on the Wednesday. By the Friday the pain was unbearable. In the early hours of Saturday morning I felt the need to go to the toilet. During this bowel movement I think my hemorrhoid burst. There was quite a bit of blood, but I was able to clean myself up. The pain was almost immediately gone. However since then I have felt a strange numbness in my groin area, which has got better over time. My anal crack is becoming quite sore and constantly damp. I put a bit of tissue paper between my buttocks and 1hour later the paper was sodden with a kind of yellow pus. What the hell is happening?!","Doctor":"You may have had an abscess rather than a hemorrhoid. These can burst, in which case the pain is promptly relieved. There could be some bleeding and there would be pus. Or you did have a hemorrhoid and the bursted area has become infected and you may be developing an abscess. In any case, it appears an infection has developed which will likely require antibiotics and perhaps some minor outpatient repair. Have it checked by your doctor or at urgent care. This is a bad area to have an infection in, and it can spread fast and get inside your body, so get seen soon. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I had a lumpectomy in April 2010 followed by brachiotherapy and chemo.  The insertion site of the SAVI device never healed.

It is attached to my pecs and is only moderately uncomfortable. The surgeon says it is OK, the radiologist says it needs to go as it makes any cancer diagnosis in that area difficult.

Cryotherapy: Freezing keloids with liquid nitrogen may flatten them but often darkens or lightens the site of treatment3.

They were moving around lots of top grade soil so it was in the air, Im worried about the risk of Toxoplasmous. Have I exposed my baby to it by being around soil?","Doctor":"Dear user,Toxoplasmosis is acquired through contact with infected cat feces, by eating raw or undercooked meat, and by eating soil contaminated fruit or vegetables. There is no association with cat ownership. Adults most commonly acquire toxoplasmosis by environmental exposure, that is, ingestion of infectious oocysts usually from soil contamination with cat feces.The greatest risk for the baby is vertical transmission in the first trimester. Thirty percent of exposed fetuses acquire the infection; however 85% of live infants appear normal at birth.To avoid your fear about your baby I will recommend you to do TORCH test (it's free for pregnant women), a screening test that includes toxoplasmosis and some other infections which are harmful for the baby.Hope I was clear and you're satisfied with my recommendation.Wish you & the baby good health!"},{"Patient":"Hi, my 3 yrs old daughter having cough on and off since 4 months ago.

And from time to time it brings on the most incredible RIGHT NOW ITCH! And then drains with the consistance of runny yougrt. In a tanish color with the most putrid stench! I try to drain it daily as I shower. I can feel a small pocket inside about the size of my pinky tip ( 1st joint ). Once while draining it, it flipped over my tail bone and LITERALLY dropped me to my knees in the shower! My sister s Doctor told her it was her Anel Gland. And that her s drains outside her body. Is this possible? Do we indeed have anel glands like animals? What the heck is this? Do you have any idea? Please help? Embrassed.","Doctor":"HiWelcome to HCMI appreciate your concerns for the itchy holes with puss.I have gone through your problems described in your query.I am of the opinion that both of you might be having fistulas in ano.A fistula-in-ano is a hollow tract lined with granulation tissue, connecting a primary opening inside the anal canal to a secondary opening in the perianal skin. Most fistulas are thought to arise as a result of infection of the anal glands with resultant abscess which is recurrent in nature.You are therefore advised to consult a surgeon for proper examination and relevant investigations like fistulogram which is done to find out the extent of the tract between the two openings.The fistulas have to be removed surgically with total excision of the tracts to prevent recurrent infection. Surgical removal can only be attempted after the infection has been controlled with a course of appropriate antibiotics.Hope this answers your query.A feed back is appreciated."},{"Patient":"Saturday night, while hosting a dinner party, I noticed/felt my index finger on my right hand begin to swell. Fairly quickly. Not wanting to alarm anyone, I left the room, headed to the kitchen, grabbed an ice pack from the freezer, and wrapped it around my finger. I also saw it quickly bruise. Party went on, did the dishes, went to bed, forgot about it. Even when I got up, until I went to use the finger to help open the back door, it did not effect me. But, of boy, it was about 1.5 the size of my other index finger and definitely bruised, mostly on the right side, but also the underside. Fast forward to Tuesday night, still swollen, still bruised. Called doctor and have an appointment on Thursday, but wanted to see what your thoughts were? Obviously, I can still type well. Thank you. Lynn","Doctor":"HI and thank you for asking us on HCM!I understand your concerns. You may have hit or prickled your finger and it may be infected. Do you remember anything like that? Another cause may be invasion of germs in any little open wound, skin damage, or under the nails. The nip of nails can cause infection sometimes. Some allergic thing may have been in contact with your finger and may have caused \\"contact dermatitis\\". Anyway to find out the real cause you have to see the doctor and take the right cure.

What is your opinion?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. A cardiology clearance is required for all surgeries especially in old age. This is because anesthetic drugs may leads to unwanted serious complications in undetected cardiac illnesses. Echo is part of routine test in cardiology checkup to rule out structural problems and to assess something called ejection fraction. Hope I have answered your query.

Not interesting in eating anything.  Any idea what it may be?","Doctor":"It sounds like she might have gotten an infection, most likely viral. The eye goop is probably pus from the infection. However, there is a chance it could be bacterial, especially if it's only in one eye. In that case, she might need antibiotic eyedrops to get rid of it. If it doesn't clear quickly or seems to be getting worse, bring her to a doctor and have it checked.

You don't say why a parathyroid was removed, but the same condition could be occurring in one of the others (there are 4).

It sounds like you have had a cure. It is unlikely for this infection to reoccur, but you could get re-infected if you are again exposed to it. To avoid it, stay away from people that have it or are prone to have it, and from environments where it is common. Avoid using drugs, especially injecting drugs. This can lower you immunity and make it easier for you to get re-infected. Taking good care of yourself as far as diet, exercise, and sleep is also vital in maintaining a strong immune system.

Any infection could potentially do this. The placenta normally should not have any bacteria present. Proteus mirabilis also can cause a very strong infection, and is often the cause of urinary infections.

Do you have any insight?","Doctor":"HiThanks for posting your query on HCM.I appreciate your concern for the old lady bitten by an insect.Apparently she is suffering from maggots infestation caused by a botfly this is referred to as Myiasis.It is an infestation of the skin by developing larvae (maggots) of a variety of fly species the most common being human botfly.She needs to be examined by a doctor for the following possible treatments:Debridement of the wound with irrigation to eliminate the larvae from the wound with application of chloroform, chloroform in light vegetable oil, or ether, with removal of the larvae under local anesthesia, has been found to be effective for wound myiasis.Other treatment option is by occluding or suffocating the larvae by placing petroleum jelly, liquid paraffin, beeswax or heavy oil, or bacon strips over the central punctum and has been used to coax the larvae to emerge spontaneously and they can be caught with forceps.Hope the suggestions given above could be of great help in getting her treated early.Regards.A feed back is appreciated."},{"Patient":"I took my 9 mo old for a well child visit and they said both ears were infected and bulging with white pussy fluid around the ear.

This can be dangerous because the horsefly can transmit parasites or diseases amongst its victims.Horsefly bites may take longer time to heal than other insect bites which generally take two to three daysMany cultures have developed remedies to assist with the pain of a horsefly bite. Icing the wound will help reduce swelling and dull the pain associated with a bite. You can also apply aloe vera, vinegar, Epsom salt, raw onion, mud, honey, a paste made from baking soda or vinegar to the bite to help reduce swelling and discomfort. Once you have applied a topical agent to provide relief, cover the area with a loose bandage to protect the wound and to help keep the remedy in place.You have already taken  Benadryl for swelling and itching.so next you should try  1% hydrocortisone cream to the area to help eliminate these symptoms.I will be happy to answer your further concern.Thank you,Dr J.D.

Ant bites or other insect bites can cause allergic reactions only and using calamine lotion locally will be helpful and taking out the sting if possible will be good also. In case of tick bite doxycycline prophylaxis should be taken. Better to consult a physician or dermatologist to rule out and manage the condition.Hope this may help you. Let me know if anything not clear.Thanks."},{"Patient":"Dear Dr, My son had wheezing trouble when he was 3 years old. Now he is 10 years old. We had taken him to many doctors but still this problem persists. Once we took him to a Chest Specialist who prescribed inhalers like Foracort Rotacaps 200 along with some tablets like Vita, etc .Regular visit to the doctor was done for 8 months & his wheezing trouble was under control. But we found that my son developed some skin rashes in his hand(blackish in colour) & also he was gaining more weight. Hence we stopped the treatment. Then we took him to a Homeopathy Specialist for 6 months but no improvement was there. He is suffering from severe cough every night. At times we give him rotacap capsule which makes him little calm. Kindly advice on how to proceed with this problem","Doctor":"Hi sir...Your son seems to have chronic asthma. The wheezing is more common during slight changes in weather and also common in winter. I suggest you avoid dust and allergens to which he has allergy. Weight & rashes could be due to Foracort. The chest physician has prescribed right medication, the medication can be contuined along with asthalin rotacaps when wheeze is severe. I suggest you to consult once again to same doctor..Thank you"},{"Patient":"I have sever calcification chunks poking thru my skin.

In most cases, you will need no treatment, but you should see your doctor if you are uncomfortable, you don’t know the cause of the bumps, or you suspect skin cancer or an infection.Skin bumps that are harmless and need no treatment can be removed for cosmetic reasons. For instance, your dermatologist can freeze skin tags or warts to remove them. You can have cysts or lipomas removed surgically. Other bumps that are itchy or irritated may be treated with topical ointments.thank you."},{"Patient":"My name is Santosh.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I would explain that a single spike in blood pressure values could be related to different causes : increased salt or caffeine intake, anxiety, etc.. Anyway, I would recommend you to closely monitor your blood pressure values frequently during the day for a week. If your blood pressure values are above the normal ranges (130/85mm Hg) most of the time, starting anti-hypertensive therapy may be needed. I would also recommend performing some tests (complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, blood electrolytes, fasting glucose, kidney and liver function tests, etc.. ) to investigate for secondary causes of arterial hypertension. In the meantime, I would recommend reducing salt and caffeine intake in your diet and performing a lot of physical activity. Hope I have answered your query.

A minor scratch on the skin would not require a repeat vaccine but since it is on the lip I would recommend a repeat Rabies vaccination.

All said and done since it is your pet dog which has been vaccinated , there is no need for re vaccination.

How worried do I need to be, and what precautions should I be taking?  Thank you.","Doctor":"Chickenpox (varicella), a viral illness characterised by a very itchy red rash, is one of the most common infectious diseases of childhood.It is spread by droplets from a sneeze or cough, or by contact with the clothing, bed linens or oozing blisters of an infected person. The onset of symptoms is 10 to 21 days after exposure. The disease is most contagious a day or two before the rash appears and until the rash is completely dry and scabbed over.Chickenpox is already contagious one or two days before the typical rash is visible. People usually also have headaches and joint pain. Chickenpox remains contagious until the final blisters have dried up and the scabs have all fallen off.It is a little unlikely that you might get infected by the grandson, but i would recommend you to get vaccinated for chickenpox.Varivax, a two-dose vaccine for chickenpox, is highly recommended for healthy children, adolescents, and adults who did not have the disease during childhood.Those aged 13 and over who do not have evidence of immunity should get two doses of the vaccine four to eight weeks apart.Take Care"},{"Patient":"I am 33 years old 1m60 around 70 kg  suffering from sinusitis with pain and headache around my eyes .Doctors here suggested cleaning surgery .I suffer from ulcerative colitis - on full remission now Taking Imuran and rafassal -5 Aminosalicylic acid Otherwise Ok Is surgery really nessecary?

I know that it's a fairly common condition and many strains clear up on their own (which is why I'm confused as to why he may still have it). I am unsure of what particular strain he has.We've yet to have sex, but can I get it through kissing or holding hands?I have had all three doses of the Gardasil vaccine, how long will that last? What exactly does it protect me from?I've heard condoms are not particularly helpful in preventing the spread of HPV, is this true? Is oral sex utterly out of the question? Can I catch HPV if he preforms oral sex on me? Should I be concerned about digital stimulation/penetration, both him acting on me and vice versa?  Is there a way to have safe sex? He claims to be mostly asymptomatic and I've never seen a wart or the like on him, but can I still catch it?","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to HCM,Human Papillomavirus (HPV) affects only the skin and it will be localized to the wart. Once the wart is cleared by topical application of cream you will become free from infection.It is transmitted to your partner, if you indulge in unprotected sexual activity during the presence of lesion. Once the wart is cleared by the topical medicines you can have normal sexual activity and you will be non infectious.5% Imiquade cream should be applied over the wart on alternate days for 4 months. Before application of this cream you need to apply Vaseline over the wart and then you have to apply the imiquade cream.Mean while you have to boost up your immunity which helps to clear your wart. To boost the immunity you need to take orally capsule Zincolac, daily for 30 days.Thank you."},{"Patient":"I am down with typhoid again after 2 years.

So it is rather hardly possible to get infected through the scratch. It is only possible if the wound has direct contact with the saliva during bite.What you need now is simple wound cleansing, a booster dose of Inj tetanus toxoid.So in conclusion, scratch should not cause virus infection.Hope this suggestion could be of help to you.

I am Dr Arun Tank answering your concern.ASO rises when we have streptococcus infections.The common site of infection is throat. But apart from it can also infects heart valves, joints etc.So probably you have been operated for tonsils, but the focus of infection may be different.The rise in ASO favours the support in that direction. I advice you should think for blood and culture for streptococcus bacteria. Once you receive the sensitivity report for the bacteria, you can take the most effective treatment. Once you take the complete treatment all your infection will be cured.Please take the complete treatment.I will be happy to answer your further concern on bit.ly/DrArun.Thank you,Dr Arun TankInfectious diseases specialist,HCM."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am a 31 year old woman who as of right now has yet another Pilonidal abcess in the crease of my buttocks.

Definitely surgery causes a incision gap, as it is very deep in the but crack, but for future this is the good option.I also advice you to take good care of the hygiene locally.

Is this normal?  could it be an infection starting?","Doctor":"Dear sir, HiThanks for posting your query on HCM.I appreciate your concern for your son's problem.I am of the opinion that it is an exaggerated response of healing referred to as Keloids.When skin is injured scar tissue forms over the wound to repair and protect the injury. In some cases, scar tissue grows excessively, forming smooth growths called keloids.Usually they are not harmful but may cause cosmetic concerns hence do not require treatment because they tend to shrink and become flatter over time even without treatment.You can apply a moisturizing cream to keep the tissue soft.If growth continues or if he gets pain or itching, you may visit a dermatologist for possible use of  Corticosteroid injections to reduce inflammationCauterization (cold) Freezing the tissue to kill skin cellsLaser treatments to reduce scar tissueHope your query is being answered.Kindly rate the answer, if you are convinced.Regards"},{"Patient":"hi - I was taking propranolol hcl er for heart palpitations and facial flushing It worked very well but became very expensive.

This is a lesion that looks like a callus that typically appears on the bottom of the foot. It is caused by a virus. These can be painful and can get bigger or spread. They may require repeated treatments to get them under control. Popping it does not help.

I realise that the test will not be read for another 24 hours, I am just wondering when a reaction will begin.","Doctor":"Hello dear,Thank you for your contact to health care magic.I read and understand your concern. I am Dr Arun Tank answering your concern.Tuberculin test or mantoux test is the test to know allergic reaction to protein part present in the body because of the infection.If you are infected with tuberculosis, you have infected protein in the body. And so you are allergic to the protein part.The reaction will start after the 48 hours. So you have to wait 24 hour more to start up reaction.If you have spent time in the tuberculosis prone country you will be exposed to the infection and so you are prone to the positive reaction.Positive reaction dose not mean you are having a TB right now. Instead it means you are exposed to the infection once.Induration in the reaction is counted while erythema and wheal is ignored. If the horizontal diameter of the reaction is more than 10 mm than it is positive reaction.I will be happy to answer your further concern on bit.ly/DrArun.Thank you,Dr Arun TankInfectious diseases specialist,HCM."},{"Patient":"hi to all...i just wanna ask something about my pus infection on my delts area...i'm a competitive bodybuilder..before it happen i remember my last injection of steroid on that site was 1 1/2 month ago..and now my delt are infected with pus,i tried to remove those pus on my delt by sticking syringe and suck the pus on it...i drawn 20cc + of pus on that same day..i tried to take cefalixin for two weeks but nothing happen....pls help me what kind of atibiotic do i need to take...cause in planning to get back in training again for a show...","Doctor":"You probably need more extensive incision and drainage to get rid of the infection. 20 cc is a lot of pus, so it appears that you have a pretty big infection there. To really get rid of it, the infected area needs to be opened up and rinsed out well. This is NOT something you should be doing yourself. A doctor has to do this.

My three year old shots are up to date but the newborn is a three weeks old","Doctor":"Measles is a viral disease primarily transmitted  from person to person by large respiratory droplets . It can also spread by the airborne route such as aerosols. Infected people are usually contagious from 4- 6 days before until 4 -5 days after  onset of rash. For babies Measles-mumps-rubella MMR vaccine is usually given at ninth month as a preventive vaccination. For your 3 yr old kid kindly make sure he/she was given MMR at nine months of age and another booster is given at 3-5yrs of age. For your 3week old baby if you have had measles before, your baby won’t need any treatment. This is because your antibodies would have passed to him/her in the womb during pregnancy. This gives him/her immunity to the virus for the first six months, and possibly a bit longer.also make sure you are breast feeding your child exclusively.If you have not had measles before, he may be given an injection of human normal immunoglobin (HNIG).

Hi there my baby daughter is 5mnths old and since yesterday her eyes is reddish and nose she is rubbing it every time . Her eyes tears a lot and her nose is running with a lot of clear water mucus. She first started 2 rub her right ear 4 days b4.  She is very cranky n dnt sleep much nw","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for posting your query to HCM.I'm sorry to read that your baby is not well in only 5 months age. From what you are describing, the most possible cause of the symptoms you describe is a common cold which might have been complicated with a otitis media (middle ear infection).You might need to send your daughter to the family doctor, so he confirms the ear infection by looking to the ear with an otoscope. In this age most probably she will need antibiotics. Also, make sure to use Paracetamol or Ibuprofen in the right dose for her weight, in case she has fever, and if she is irritated, because she may need help with the pain.Applying saline solution drops in the nose will help soften the secretions and keep the nose open. Keep breastfeeding her as needed. Hope this helps,If you have other questions, let me know.Dr. Papaqako"},{"Patient":"Hi, Yesterday, I noticed a reddish/pinkish, slightly raised rash close to my vagina also the bump is relatively tender to touch and a tad bit itchy.

The medicine you are taking helps reduce pain, prevent complications, and shorten the course of the disease, if taken before 72 hours that the disease started.  You will need to take the medicine for 10 days. The boils that you have will last 2-3 weeks, and heal in appearance.The virus will sleep in the nerve root, and when you will have a low immunity, it may appear again, and you will need to start over with the medicine you are taking for 10 days.So, my answer is no...you don't need to take the medicine all your life, but only when the infection appear again. Though, not necessarily it may reactivate again.Meanwhile, be careful to keep the area dry, and wash your hands when you touch the blisters, because it may be transmitted to other people.Hope this helps,If you have other questions, I qould be happy to answer.Take care,Dr. Papaqako"},{"Patient":"Hello Dr.Andrew, I am suffering from Yeast infection for past two years.

I'm afraid I would also be infected with the virus since his bite had caused my skin to get black bruise and two half centimeter marks. please help me. thanks","Doctor":"Hello ..welcome to HCM.I am Dr Jigar(ID specialist). In your case it appears thar your dog has very recently been vaccinated. Few things you should notice that whether behaviour of your dog has changed, was the attack by your dog seems abnormal etc..In my opinion you should start anti rabies vaccine and simultaneously observe your dog for 7 days to find any abnormal behaviour, violent movements, excessive salivation etc.. If you find pet is absolutely normal after 7 days then stop taking further shots of vaccine( this is according to international guidelines).I also want to add that apart from this you should consult physician for antitetanus shot and need of antibiotic for your wound. This is because dog bite can also cause severe bacterial wound infection.I hope this will help you. Please revert back with your feedback.Regards."},{"Patient":"I have been suffering from a sinus infection for months now. Originally diagnosed in March of this year, I ve done 8 rounds of antibiotics. 6 rounds of leviquin and 2 of ceftin(?). My zygomatic implant was removed on the left side in May. 3 weeks ago yesterday, I had sinus reconstruction and cleaning surgery. Follow up today with ENT showed no noticeable signs of infection, but i still have all the symptoms. The worst is a headache that seems centered behind the right eye into the temple area. I am on a low dose blood pressure med with a history of high hematicrit due to carbon monoxide poisoning years ago. Today, my blood pressure is 150/95/92. I m wondering if the headache is likely due to the bloodpressure rather than sinus issues.","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to Ask a Doctor service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Hypertension may cause the headache but it is very less likely if sinusitis is there because sinusitis can cause the headache for sure and it has to be taken into consideration first beside several other known and nonspecific reasons are there that may cause the headache, to find out the cause of headache is challenging if this is not the apparent one. stress can be the cause too.Hope I have answered your query, let me know for further assistance."},{"Patient":"Hi- 28 y/o female here.

Welcome to HCM.I am Dr Jigar(Infectious Disease Specialist).Well your concern is genuine. Lyme disease can be caused by bite of tick.Problem with this disease is that it is similar to many other illness and test available for diagnosis shows variable results in many patients. Same is in your case , only one band is not enough for confirmation. You should consult expert infectious disease specialist for this. There is also need to rule out other co infection like  if any. Also you did not mentioned which antibiotic you are taking. You should also know that during treatment of lyme disease some patients show unusual exaggeration in symptoms which subsides after few days.Finally your thyroid medication will not interfere with this treatment but you should get your thyroid level done if not checked recently.I hope this will help you.

It doesnt matter so much what it was, it matters that the antibiotic covers you because from your description an infection is possible. If it doesn't get better after 2 days taking the antibiotic you should see the doctor again for re-evaluation of the treatment. In addition to the ab you are taking you can get a free perscription cream which is called Fenistil hydrocort. If that and the antibiotic doesnt help within 2 days at all then the doctor needs to look at it again and decide if you need another kind of antibiotic or in addition prednisolone (cortison, antiinflammatory) as perscription pill, since it can also be an allergic reaction.

They produce mucus, which helps keep the nasal passages clear of allergens and pollutants.Sinusitis is an inflammation of the tissue that lines these cavities. In some cases, this swelling blocks off the sinuses, trapping mucus and air inside themIf you have sinusitis symptoms for more than a couple of days, check in with your doctor.With a good exam -- and sometimes imaging tests, like X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs -- you may be able to figure out exactly what's causing the problem.Often, the best sinusitis treatment is a combination of different approaches typically medication combined with self-care.The goal of treating chronic sinusitis is to:1.Reduce sinus inflammation2.Keep your nasal passages draining3.Eliminate the underlying cause4.Reduce the number of sinusitis flare-ups you haveTreatments to relieve symptoms1. Saline nasal irrigation2. Nasal corticosteroids3. Decongestants4. Antibiotics if it is due to infection5. Analgesics for the painSurgeryIn cases that continue to resist treatment or medication, endoscopic sinus surgery may be an option.

A photograph of the affected skin is required to analyze it further before running into final conclusions. From what you describing, it might be athlete's foot or tinea pedis, a fungal infection of the skin. The pus you see coming out is due to bacterial co-infection caused by scratching.

Let it dry- after that, apply OTC terbinafin and hydrocortisone cream. Or can mix terbinafin cream with diprogenta cream (which contains betamethasone).

You don't say where the hernia is, but I would expect the pain in that case would be more around the location of the hernia. It is possible that pain may referred to the back. You could also have an infection in the kidneys or an abscess somewhere in the abdomen that is referring pain to your back. A fever of 103.7 is very high and indicates significant infection. Even if it comes down, the severity of your pain and the high temperature are markers of a serious condition that should be evaluated immediately. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi I have cushing disease, lyme disease, fibromyalgia, occipital neuralgia and have been treated with antibiotics for over a year now and wbc and neutrophils are still elevated and don't understand why if being on antibiotics for over a year could this mean something","Doctor":"Cushing disease itself can cause elevated WBC, so this may not necessarily be related to an infection. Certainly a year of antibiotics should have taken care of most infections, depending on what antibiotic was used. Unusual infections or internal infections (eg, abscess in a muscle or organ) might cause a persistent elevated WBC, as might a chronic inflammatory condition. You would probably be having other symptoms, such as persistent fevers, pain, or weight loss, if that were the case. You don't say how high the WBC count is, so it is hard to assess its severity.  Be sure the Cushing disease is well treated first. If you are still having elevated WBC, you might need further evaluation or need to see a hematologist to get a specific diagnosis. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I was told that I have cellulitis by my doctor just a couple of days ago and I ve been prescribed Keflex but now the infection has spread from just the lower part of my leg to my knee on my other leg and my thigh.

You might need a different antibiotic. Contact your doctor and let him/her know what is going on, and get seen at emergency or urgent care. If you are having fevers, this is especially important. It is very concerning that infection has spread to your other leg. You might have resistant bacteria such as MRSA that require aggressive treatment. Cellulitis can get into the bloodstream and cause serious disease.

My age is 58, height 5'6\\",weight 70 Kg Somnath Bhattacharyya YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Bypass is not necessarily better. Unless you treat the underlying cause, the condition that created the plaque in the first place will continue to produce more plaque in both the stents or the bypass vessels. So over time a blockage could occur in either case again. The reason to consider the angioplasty first is that it is a much less riskier procedure and very effective. Why get your chest cut open and be put on a cardiopulmonary pump (bypass surgery) when you can just have a tube inserted through the femoral artery and into the heart (angioplasty)? Talk more to your cardiologist about your options. The key thing after having either procedure is to prevent the plaque from reaccumulating. This may require dietary changes and medicines.

Thanks","Doctor":"Rabies vaccine is made from killed virus. Therefore exposure to the vaccine cannot cause rabies. What will be present in the dog's blood after the vaccine is given will be antibodies to the rabies virus. This prevents and does not cause rabies, so any exposure to the vaccinated dog's blood will not cause rabies. You also cannot get rabies from touching anything (such as a book) that has had vaccine on it. So nothing to worry about.

This could be one of hundreds of viruses, strep, bronchitis, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, urinary tract infection, hepatitis, etc etc. If he is very sick and having a very high fever, then take him to emergency or urgent care where they can examine him and make a specific diagnosis. Then the correct treatment can be started.

How long will it take the medication to work and not feel anymore itching and discomfort?  Also, do I have to keep changing bath towels and bed sheets until all symptons are gone?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to HCM.I can understand your problem.Mebendazole is highly effective for pinworm infection. It will clear all the live parasite in the first dose. All the new parasite coming from eggs hatched after the 1st dose will be cleared in the subsequent dose. So you can expect the relief from symptoms after 2nd dose.It is very important to change the bath towel, undergarments and bed sheets daily during the treatment. Ensure they are properly washed and ironed just before you take 2nd dose. It is also very important to have your nails cut.Hope this will be helpful.Do ask if any further question is there.Thanks for using HCM.

I am taking doctors perscription of applying corn caps and also ane bottle consists of salicilic acid and other...now i am having pain on my upper foot....what i can do for this..is this any type of fungii infection that causes pain in upper foot.???please answer me asa sson as possible.Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"HiWelcome to HCM!I appreciate your concern towards the corns on the feet.It seems the prescribed medications like corn caps, salicylic acid are not effective in your case.The pain in the upper foot could be due to infection caused by the bacteria.You need to take suitable antibiotics to control the infection so that the corn gets removed by the above medications.If there is no success following the use of above medications, then you may have to consult a dermatologist for possible removal by Cauterization, or surgical removal under local anesthesia.These corns are known to recur, so that can be prevented by:Keep your feet dry and friction-free. Avoid using pointed shoes, maintain good hygiene, wash your feet regularlyWear properly fitted shoes and cotton socks, rather than wool or synthetic fibres that might irritate the skin.I hope your doubts have been clarified.Take care of your health.Reply with thanks"},{"Patient":"Hi...I might soon be starting a relationship with a wonderful person.

This side effect is commonly seen during the long treatment with Gleevec , it may be associated with high BP and sometimes the fluid gets collected in the lungs causing difficulty in breathing, etc. Now since the scan is not showing the evidence of the GIST you may please consult your doctor whether to continue with Gleevec for how many weeks or months.Lasix definitely helps in clearing the edema fluid but it also has some side effects on its long run.Take care of your health."},{"Patient":"I have had these, what looks to me like really tiny blisters filled with water in a tiny cluster in the palm of my hand...they don't itch, but when my skin gets dry around it, some really tiny pieces tend to flake off.

I am really worried that there is something more serious wrong with her, and don't know what to do.  My daughter has Kaiser and they won't approve her to be seen by another doctor.","Doctor":"hello..she has mild to moderate range of fevers..the doctor must have thoroughly examined her(i suppose)..and diagnosed to have a viral fever..does she have fever associated with chills?pain in stomach?is it a malaria prone area(i don't know where you stay)?with a viral infection the above said symptoms are common..wait for one two days and if you feel the fever isn't coming down take her to your doctor and get investigated..if she was my patient i would have advised a CBP malaria smear(depending on symptoms) Xray or a scan as per need..if you have anymore queries feel free to ask me.."},{"Patient":"hello, i have undergone the mantoux test about 30 hours ago and at the site where I was injected, only a red spot is seen. although it is light in color as if I've been bitten by a mosquito. the diameter of the red spot on my arm is about 1cm. does that mean I am mantoux positive?","Doctor":"Hello.. Welcome to HCM.I am Dr Jigar(ID Specialist).First of all mantoux test is tuberculin sensitivity test which tell whether your body is prepared to mount immune response against tuberculosis bacteria.After giving injection results are read only after 48 hours and maximum upto 72 hours.Development of Redness is very common and is not counted in result. Only diameter of induration is considered. So do not panic redness will fade after few days, just go to your doctor at 48 hours and then ask for interpretation.I hope this will help you. Give your valuable feedback.Regards.Dr Jigar"},{"Patient":"i have had severe toenail fungus causing deformed toes for quite a while now but suddenly on my middle toe on one foot there is pain and a red line going around the middle of the toe and the toe above that is red.  could this be infection and could it be connected with the fungus that has been neglected?","Doctor":"hi,i need more details like  age, sex, diabetes history, on drugs? any other medical history you forgot to mention.picture of the toe would help me a lot..deformed toes?or toe nails?if the case is toe nails mostly it is a fungal infection or can be a bacterial also..you start using terbinafine forte ointment for a few days..this shows immediate relief if the cause is a fungal infection.if the symptoms persist approach a physician..he takes a tissue sample for examination and prescribe a specific drug..if it is toe then it could be rheumatoid arthritis..for which you have to take an immunosuppressive therapy..hope my answer helped youif you have any more queries i would be happy to help you.."},{"Patient":"My husband says he was stung possibly by bee on his lower leg 12 weeks ago while mowing the grass.

Do you think the Vodka is driving the thrush? I have been on the Advair 8 years with no problem until now. I have been drinking for the last 1 1/2 yrs.

Steroids are known to suppress the immunity of a person vulnerable to get fungal infection if used in the form of inhaler.Alcohol consumption (Vodka) is associated with bad oral hygiene which promotes the growth of the fungus.So, maintain your oral hygiene, do frequent saline water gargle after every use of inhaler if oral thrush does not subside then you may have to take Nystatin solution for the fungal infection.Regards"},{"Patient":"i keep getting thrush after every period,but i have also found when i wee it smells funny,could i now have a water infection.is there anything i can do about this,i have just had a smear and that came back clear but i did have a letter to say i was suffering from thrush then when i was examined,i am 26","Doctor":"Hello dear,Thank you for your contact to health care magic.I read and understand your concern.

Cellulitis is an infectious disease of the skin caused by bacteria of Strep group. As you are a diabetic, it will take longer for the cellulitis to heal as compared to non-diabetic patients.

I am Dr Arun Tank answering your concern.You should go for testing of blood. This can be tested in any of the advanced laboratories available near to your house.There are two tests that can differentiate the condition. One is blood eosinophilia and other is the fungal hypha antigen testing present in the blood.If this two tests are detected in blood and in the respiratory system. Than you are infected with the mold.Mold mostly come into system by the inhalation of the fungal hyphae.Once inhaled it causes allergic reaction in the body. This is responsible for the reaction in the body.To keep the antigen away from the body is most important thing. This is the final cure for the disease.If you are severely affectedbthan you can take the fluconazole tablet and prednisolone low dose tablet under your doctors guidance.

Some of these bites become infected and weep even if I haven't scratched them. Why am I so prone to these bites and is there anything I can do to prevent them?","Doctor":"Thanks for informing me about your health concerns.The fact is that your skin is rather sensitive. This is because people from temperate zones do not have the necessary skin defenses to deal with the rather harsh conditions obtained in the tropics.Mosquito's in the tropics have now mostly become resistant to repellents. Your skin gets pricked with a mosquito's \\"proboscis\\" once you are bitten by one. The saliva of the mosquito carries germs (naturally) and some chemicals called \\"antigens\\". These \\"antigens\\" cause your immune system to immediately respond. This causes swelling, redness and itching which is called as \\"inflammation\\" that leads your insect bites to \\"weep\\". I think you have an \\"allergy\\" to the mosquito's in the vacation spots that you frequent. This is because there are many different kinds of mosquito's in different parts of the world. I advise you to kindly ask a physician to give you \\"anti-histaminic\\" pills, and a local steroid-antibiotic combination ointment to apply to your insect bites. The \\"anti-histaminics\\" will stop your skin from over reacting, the steroid in the ointment will speed up the healing process, and the antibiotic will eliminate infections if any. In the tropics, you can find many products to repel further, and outright kill nasty mosquito's. There are vaporizors and neon electrocutor traps, and various perfume grade aerosols that eliminate the pests. I suggest that you wear fine cotton wear that would keep you cool and would prevent insect stings.    Please feel free to inquire about any other health problems."},{"Patient":"Hi my name is Milka and i have high blood presure ,doctor give me medicine for high blood presure to take one time a day,name blood presure medicine is Lisinopril 5 mg and now i feel little fever,dry mouth and i have diarrhea and i didn t feel very good.....and doctor give me one more medicine to treat overactive bladder name of that medicine is Oxyputynin er 10 mg.my doctor told me to take those two medicine once a day....please tell me what i should do to feel better and what i should eat and drink to help me feel better and How i can lower my blood pressure....please help me","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.

Your symptoms are suggestive of a brown recluse spider bite where the skin around the bite wound swells and reddens due to a local reaction. Such wounds should be cleaned thoroughly to avoid secondary bacterial infection. Based on the symptoms you have mentioned in your query, I suspect the above scenario where your wound was not attended to in time and secondary bacterial infection has occurred leading to cellulitis. Cellulitis is caused by bacteria like staphylococcus and streptococcus.You were correctly treated by broad spectrum antibiotics as cellulitis spreads very fast and cause septicemia.Hope I have helped you with this answer.Thanks."},{"Patient":"hi i have a 6 year old kid, last summer she got sick at camp and was diagnosed with shigella!!! bad case.  well she got over it and now its another summer and now she has this bright green hard BM's and always complaining about having to throw up and stomach pains?? what should i do???","Doctor":"Hello there,I am dr.milan an infectious disease specialist answering your question.My suggestion for you is you go for culture & sensitivity test of stool sample of kid by a reliable Microbiology lab and by a qualified Microbiologist doctor.

It may normally be in the mucosa, but it doesn't necessarily cause symptoms. The culture will determine from which antibiotic is  sensitive to kill the bacteria. Ph imbalance is the cause of symptom to develop, so for the Strep to grow at the first place. While if you have used so many times antibiotics, the bacteria might have created resistance, lead to a chronic infection which reactivates once in a while. Sometimes low immunity gives more predominance to them to grow. The recommendations are that if the symptoms reactivate more then 6 times/yeah, then the tonsils must be removed.

He will perform the labs to see if Lupus is under control. will also do a Urine culture, to decide who is the best antibiotic that will take effect for you. With a gynecological exam he can determine where is the bleeding coming from.Meanwhile try to take plenty of fluids, and have a healthy diet.Hope I have answered your questions.

Canesten 2%; Miconazole 1%; Fluconazole 1%- all this should be easy findable over the counter. Use them 1-2 times/day of you have the infection, and each time after getting out of pool in you go to pool to prevent getting it. The same creams are used to treat the Athlete's foot.Hope I answered your question.

Poly sinusitis is the inflammation of multiple sinuses at one time. The other term we use commonly for this is pan sinusitis.
