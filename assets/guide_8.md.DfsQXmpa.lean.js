Subsequently , I was put on gentamicin for 10 days and doxy 100 mg for another 10 days alongwith pantocid 40. The doxy course comes to an end today. Doctor has advised to stop all medications. I feel ok now, if not completely alright. My problem is : 1) I believe if I stop all the medications , the abdominal pain will return. 2) more than the pain, my problem is the bowel. Every morning my stomach never used to empty completely. I had to use the was room more than twice every day to clear my stomach. The stools used to be semi solid in nature .3) all of the above come alongwith elevated heart rate. - by being on doxy 100 mg alongwith pantocid 40 mg , the above symptoms are getting better if not completely cured. Do advise what should I do ?","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM! Thanks for posting your query here. The bacterial infection would have been subsided now after using the antibiotics for 3 weeks. Hence after stopping the medication your problem will not return for sure. The difficulty in passing the stools can be referred as constipation. If there is a difficulty a diet rich in fibre, having lots of water and exercise will help in reducing the problem. All these mentioned will also help you in reducing the GERD problem. The increased heart rate could be because of your anxiety. Pantocid 40mg will give relief in GERD. You are feeling better because of pantocid. The only affect of using pantop for longer duration-more than 3 months- is rebound acidity. Please continue Pantocid for 2 more weeks. Then you can slowly stop the drug. Hope this is helpful to you.

Post gastro-enteritis the normal microbes present in the intestine decline in number as they get washed away in stools during diarrhea. Those microbes are responsible to keep off abdominal bloating, which can cause distension of abdomen and firmness. In addition to this, other factors like high sugar contents in diet (including fruit juices and fluids taken to replace loss due to diarrhea/vomiting) can also cause abdominal bloating. The other cause could be constipation as you mentioned solid stools in the query which can be hard, not semi solid or soft stool. Most medications taken for diarrhea/vomitings have side-effects of constipation.Both the problems can be taken care at home with ease by adding probiotic's like yogurt, fibre rich food's like chia seed's and raisins and drinking enough water."},{"Patient":"3 year old with off and on stomach pain for last 72 hours.

Let me give you a slight insight into what this shaking could be, the term jitteriness refers to tremors in newborns. It is the representation of an exaggerated startle response. It is often confused for seizures (also known as convulsion and fits), which naturally unnerves the parents.It is the most common involuntary movement seen in infants, which disappears completely as they mature. The neuro-development of the babies with no other overt neurological sign but tremulousness is generally good, especially when there is no history of complications during pregnancy, or immediately before and after birth. Involves jaw and limbs. Jittering is easily initiated in newborns by external stimuli such as handling the baby or loud noise. It can be easily stopped by:1.) Gentle flexing (bending) of the affected limb.2.) Just holding the limb firmly and reassuringly.3.) Initiating the baby's sucking action also stops the jittery movements.The tremulous movements are most frequently seen during the first few days of life in normal mature babies. It may extend throughout the neonatal period. It usually resolves spontaneously by two months of age. But some infants, with no neurological compromise, may continue to be tremulous till seven to nine months of age.If you notice any other developmental delay in baby or symptoms getting worse over time, kindly see a doctor. Go for regular postnatal check-up's and for now only observe the baby.Hope I have answered your query.

Ben Carson revolutionized his field in several areas, including hemispherectomies (removal of half of the brain to prevent untreatable severe seizures, such as those caused by Rasmussen's encephalitis). He dramatically increased the safety of the procedure by developing several major surgical innovations, which include better ways of controlling bleeding and infection, as well as an innovative system of incrementally removing specific brain parts as units rather than in whole sections.Does not matter which part of world the surgeon is from, he will put all his effort in the best interest of patient. At the end of the day all the treating doctor's have same goal, to treat the patient with care."},{"Patient":"My 5 year old daughter has been sick with what we thought was the flu since Tuesday.  Started with high fever (103*) and Included lots of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.  Also loss of appetite.  Saw the doctor for that and ruled out strep throat (even though she had pus sacks on her tonsils). For the last 4 days she's been experiencing severe burning of her anus...like her stools are very acidic.  Even when she isnt passing stools.  Also she has been passing light yellow colored stools that are very buoyant.  And still, on and off bouts of abdominal pain.   Any ideas if this is something more serious than flu stuff?   I'm a little worried about gallbladder issues.","Doctor":"Hi welcome to Health care magic forum. Thanks for choosing H.C.M.Forum. Your 5 year old daughter had fever, abdominal pain, nausea,and vomiting, and loss of appetite. She had sacs of pus on her tonsils. She had loose motions as well, and burning in the anus. It appears to be follicular tonsillitis, nausea and vomiting are secondary to the fever, the yellow stools could be due to the fever or the drugs used for the fever. Some drugs may be causing gastric irritation, and acidic substances in the intestines, resulted in burning anus. I advise you to consult a pediatric specialist, for diagnosis and treatment. She may have to get culture and sensitivity of the throat swab  besides other routine tests for confirmation. Don't worry, she will be fine in two days with correct way of treatment. In the mean while you can use paracetamol and anti spasmodic for temporary pain and fever relief. Wishing for a quick and complete relief.

And on Pedi-Lax fiber gummies after he has not taken treatment for 2 months now but I have noticed that he has a fart disorder he frequently farts and poop comes along with the fart... it is on the soft side and his stools are formed.","Doctor":"Hello I have gone through your question and understand your concern.Constipation can cause stomach cramps, reduced appetite and irritability.Constipation can usually be controlled with good bowel habits and medicines.Diet is less important in treatment of constipation in children than it is in adults.Giving your child adequate fibre in their diet might help prevent constipation in some children who have a natural tendency. To add more fibre to your child's diet, you can give your child: At least two servings of fruit each day. Fruits with the peel left on, such as plums, prunes, raisins, apricots and peaches, have a lot of fibre.At least three servings of vegetables each day.Cereals that are less processed, such as bran cereals, shredded wheat, whole grain cereals or oatmeal. Avoid refined cereals, such as corn flakes and rice bubbles. Potty train your child, Children should learn to respond to their body's urge to poo. It is important for constipated children to develop the habit of sitting on the toilet regularly."},{"Patient":"While I was helping my 3 yr old get a drink my 10th month old son just got a hold of the Calemine Lotion bottle that was up on the table and was dumping it on his lips and face.

What should I do or watch for?","Doctor":"Hello I have gone through your question and understand your concern.if calamine lotion is swallowed, gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea and vomiting may occur.Acute exposure to the dust form of zinc oxide can result in coughing, upper respiratory tract irritation, chills, fever, nausea and vomiting.In my opinion the quantity of Zinc ingested by your child was not enough to produce symptoms. Wait and observe the child for next 24 hrs, if any of the above mentioned symptoms occur go to ER for managment. Do not attempt to induce vomiting at home to get the ingested contents out. It is better to observe the child at home rather than sending the child out to play or to school."},{"Patient":"hi my son is 2yr 2months old.for past 7 months he suffers from severe chest congestion resulting in weeing and also breathes very hard. doctor advised me to give him asthalin inhaler as required and budecort inhaler daily twice a day.i m givin him the later from past 4 months.is the medication right and safe. nisha","Doctor":"Hi.... the medication is extremely safe, no need to worry about it.

CMV is a treatable disease if regular check up and therapies are carried out, complications like neurological issues, hearing loss and other problems can be prevented. Babies who are infected in the womb usually show no symptoms of a CMV infection after they're born. In a few cases, there are symptoms at birth, which can include premature delivery, being small for gestational age, jaundice, enlarged liver and spleen, microcephaly (small head), and feeding difficulties. These babies are also at high risk for developing hearing, vision, neurological, and developmental problems. Typical blood picture shows loq to very low cell count, which may or may not need transfusiom pre-term babies have low immunity, fragile veins keeping in mind the risk benifit ratio tranfusion will be planned.

But in actual the food is not spicy. his age is 10 years, weight around 22 kg. can you help me.","Doctor":"Hello I have gone through your question and your concern. This all happens because fussy eating is part of children’s development. It’s a way of exploring their environment and asserting their independence. And it’s also because their appetites go up and down depending on how much they’re growing and how active they are.The good news is that children are likely to get less fussy as they get older. One day your child will probably eat and enjoy a whole range of different foods.Try inloving your child in helping you out with cooking,  so that the child participates in actuvity involved with food, give a fresh fruit or a glass of homemade fresh juice daily, a boiled egg daily. Try making food more vibrant and fun to eat. Life is too exciting for children sometimes, and they’re too busy exploring the world around them to spend time eating.Children learn by testing the boundaries of acceptable behaviour. They can be very strong willed when it comes to making decisions about food (to eat or not to eat, and what to eat). It’s all part of their social, intellectual and emotional development."},{"Patient":"Hi there, I have been having problems with my stomach for the past few  weeks!

Bloating and vomiting are nonspecific symptoms,but these lumos you re feeling are definitely something that must be evaluated! You should do at least ultrasound to rule some serious diagnosis out. Usually such symptoms are caused by gastritis,gErd or hiatus hernia so gastroscopy should be performed too. There is no specific cure. If you have only gastritis this is treated by changing dietary habbits. You should avoid alcohol,coffee,smoking,fats and fast food, carbonated drinks and eat more milk and milk products, fruit and vegetables,boiled food and natural beverages and teas. 1 hour after meal you should not sit or lay. Also lay with elevated upper body. If you are overweight you should do often exercise. But as I said, i really suggest to di some imaging tests do investigate these lumps.

Like 3 months ago, one night she wake me screaming and then she started crying but soon she slept. I was not thinking that there is something wrong as this was not the first time that happened. In the morning I found 2 blood drops on her pillow and I thought it was from teething. Just 4 weeks ago the same thing happened-scream, crying and blood on the pillow. The next day she was biting her inner cheeks till blood ( as her cheeks was little swollen from the one from the one during sleep) and then crying. I was reading in the net that this sleep biting can be from sleep seizure or sleep apnea. I never witnessed any seizure or something like this because I was also sleeping when that happened. Unfortunately there is no other explanation on the net for this sleep biting. Now I am really worried. Do you really think that she is having seizures or apneas or this biting is normal in her age. I’ve asked all of my friends with babies and they said that their kids never had such an episodes ever. Please also note that she is also sometimes crying while sleeping, but I think Is normal, also from time to time screaming( just for second), but I also thing is normal to happened sometimes in babies due to teething. I will be really thankful if you advice me on what can this sleep cheek biting can be from. Please advise me if I have to see a specialist as our pediatrician said that he doesn’t know that seizures can cause a biting during sleep. Thank you so much for your time.

Based on the results of the lipid profile your son seems to be suffering hyperlipidemia which is suspicious of familial in nature. Familial combined hyperlipidemia is one of the most common genetic disorder that is passed down through families. It causes high cholesterol and high blood triglycerides. It can cause early heart attacks.Other causes may include diabetes and hypothyroidism. High cholesterol is associated with an increase of atherosclerosis and heart disease. High triglycerides by themselves do not appear to increase atherosclerosis or heart disease, but there is an increased risk of pancreatitis. Your son needs to be properly evaluated and certain lab tests such as blood glucose, thyroid function tests, and complete lipid profile.He may need lipid lowering drugs such as fibrates, bile acid binding resins, nicotinic acid to lower his cholesterol levels and triglycerides. Fish supplements which contain Omega-3 Fatty Acids are to be given as they have been shown to lower triglycerides.Statins should not be given as they are not safe in young children. Beside medications he should have dietary changes are a common first-line treatment.1. His total fat intake should not exceed more than 30 percent of total daily calories.2.

Avoid all the foods and beverages that instigate or enhance the problems. Laxatives if the stools are hard.Sitz bath in a tub with warm water. 5-day course of an antibiotic and metronidazole, probiotics, symptomatic and supportive.,If all the investigations are normal, you may have to undergo MRI of the spine as there s a possibility of prolapsed inter-vertebral disc causing such symptoms of knife cutting inside your stomach."},{"Patient":"hi 25 year old female, nausea, severe stomach top quad pain, bad breath, slightly raised temp, had appendix removed day 2 still have all symptoms, but now have vomiting, diarrhea and a sore throat, bloods are normal, ultrasound was clear, and when my appendix was removed they could see no sign of anything bad, also had chest xrays which are clear, could i have stomach cancer?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting your query.

Should we be concerned yet. We also have been giving her water in between feeds to keep her de-hydrated.","Doctor":"Hi,You did right by giving her fluids to avoid dehydration. The teething doesn't start except after 6 months of age. So the suckling of the hands is just a habit some kids get used to.

But, here it is...I have had this continuous pain in my colon (lower left abdomen area) for quite a while. It is getting worse. I also have been having blood in my stool. Sometimesa lot, but sometimes just light pink, or dark spots in my stool, or sometimes not at allfor a while and then it comes back. When I get this pain, it goes into my lower back and sometimes on the right side of my lower abdomen, but seems like the pain is starting on the left lower side. This has been going on for about five years now. First, I thought I just had hemmoroids, but it is getting worse and now I can't sit or walk or even get out of bed sometimes.  Sometimes, I can't even roll over in bed at night without a sever sharp pain in the core of my lower stomach. It comes and goes, so that's why I haven't seen a doctor yet. But, like I said, it is getting worse. I do have an appointment, finally, at the doctors at the end of the month, but to behonest, I am a little scared. Should I be?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting your query. With the available described symptoms, there appears to be possibility of left iliac fossa pathology i.e. colonic growth or ulcer. Presence of pain along with bleeding per rectum signify the diagnosis. Bleeding from any where in body is an alarming sign and should be evaluated. You should consult with internal medicine specialist/ general surgeon and should go for thorough check up. You should also go for complete blood count, ultrasound imaging, colonoscopy and x ray abdomen for better clarification. Treatment depends on exact diagnosis. Meanwhile, you should take hemostatic medication along with tramadol. Take care, Dr. Mayank Bhargava"},{"Patient":"My daughter has had intermittent abdominal pain over the last year. She is 7 1/2 at this time. We have had every GI workup possible by several doctors. All labs were normal. She s gotten admitted to the hospital twice now. The only thing that helps is to roll in fetal position. We have tried diet changes such as no lactose, etc, to no avail. I am wondering if it is possible that she could be having GYN issues instead. What if she is actually getting menstrual cramps and since she is only 7, it never occurred to us to get that checked out?","Doctor":"Hi,The most common of abdomen pain is constipation, and there are kids that are contipated and goes to the bathroom all day, other did you read about irritable bowel?

The fourth possibility (if the child is active in between 2 fever episodes) is a viral illness. I will explain you how a viral illness behaves so that you can be more comfortable. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4 to 7 days.

Do I need to take her to an ER?","Doctor":"Hi.... looks like viral illness. Please do not panic. What you are doing is perfect. To make you more comfortable, I will explain you how a viral illness behaves.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My 6 yr old daughter stepped on a bee about 54 hours ago.

How many days per month does she cough or feel breathless?2. How many nights per month does her sleep get disturbed due to above symptoms?3. Does she feel breathless when she runs around or plays with other kids?4. Are the symptoms when there are seasonal changes?5. Is there any family history of asthma or any other sort of allergies like skin allergy etc.?6. Is the cough always associated with fever?If your answer is yes for any of the above questions, your kid might be having viral associated wheezing or multi triggered wheezing and I suggest you meet a paediatric pulmonologist who is near your place.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my 8 month old sratches his face so hard when he has wind it bleeds. he gets that worked up that he can not bring up his gas. tryed infacol / gripe water he just really struggles to get his wind up wakes all night because he is to tired to burp any tips to help his wind to stop him hurting himself","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.This is called evening colic and is quite common in this age group. This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in air too. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief.The two best ways to relieve this distress is -1. Do not put the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2. If still crying - put the baby in prone position and keep patting the back gently so that the baby passes off the flatus and gets relieved.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

This occurs when the kid has hard stools, almost similar to constipation. But what happens here is the liquid stools will seep out on the sides of the hard stools and leak out.

Maximum milk consumption per day should not exceed 300-400ml4. Minimum 3-4 cups of fruits and vegetables to be consumed per day5.

My son Lance is 7 and half years old. He can not hear from his left ear. We have taken him to 2 ENT specialists, They did the audiogram, and tunning fork test. Based on their analysis, he is having more than 90% hear loss. They suggested that a hearing aid will not be useful in his case. We realized this problem when he was one and half year old. Nobody in public/school/society can make out his left ear hearing disability. Only when we tell people they realize it. He can hear from other ear perfectly. Only if someone speaks very very slow in his left ear, he will turn his right ear to him... can you please suggest what other tests we need to do? Is CI is an option? Thank you for your help. Richard 0000","Doctor":"Hi.... I understand your concern. As there is 1 normal and perfectly functioning ear you need not worry.

In that case cochlear implant will definitely be the only option in your son's case.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi, recently my wife undergone a ceasserian baby delivery.She is under control of all spicy and oily foods and feeds breakmilk to the baby but baby is having loose motion and gold colour water like stool.

Mother's food is not at all related to the babies problem. Do not restrict mother's dirt regarding is.What your kid is having is not a diarrhea and is only a gastro-colic reflux. It is quite common for babies of this age group t pass small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhea and especially antibiotics are not indicated.When the baby takes milk , the stomach expands - then when it is contracting it sets off a wave form which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum, a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out. This is the basis for gastro-colic reflex.

The other possibilities are viral or streptococcal pharyngitis.I suggest you see your pediatrician and get a rapid streptococcal antigen test done. If it is positive then she will require antibiotics. if it is negative then it might be viral illness and doesn't require antibiotics at all.Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in children.

Thanks","Doctor":"Hi.... by what you say I feel that your son is having only having a simple viral illness.Cough and cold are quite common in such viral illness.Blood going down on the wrong side and causing chest infection is not a likely cause. It is a very simple surgery and I suggest you not to attribute this viral illness to that.Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in children. For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.For cold you can use Cetrizine at 0.25mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days.For nasal block, plain saline nasal drops will do, every 4-6th hourly to relive nasal congestion.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my five year old has been having chills for two days now, I took her to the ER and the doctor says that it is a virous.

Sometimes when i'm sitting and i laugh or cough, i get an extreme pain in the lower right side of my stomach, and that tends to be where the general pain comes from most of the time. When i press on it a lot of the time it tends to hurt.Also, I get an extremely sore chest whenever i run even for a few seconds, and it lasts a while and is really painful and it's sometimes a little hard to breathe. Also, sometimes i get pains in my heart, or thats what i think it is, and sometimes i get shooting pains down my left arm, like pulsing pains.Also, I sometimes get out of breath and dizzy quite a lot, and i get a lot of headaches, and sometimes i'm a bit shaky.And i don't know if it's worth mentioning but i also get quite bad mood swings. But i think you should know that i did get the contraceptive implant in June.","Doctor":"first thing u need to do is ultrasonograph of abdomen and pelvis i feel it may be recurrent appendicitis"},{"Patient":"I have been having left side abdominal pain for 5 days now, accompanied by lack of appetite and nausea. I went to the doctor who did a pelvic exam, found nothing, and sent me for an ultrasound. They found a \\"moderate\\" amount of fluid around the left ovary, which they believe is the result of a ruptured cyst. The pain is relatively mild and moves from my left side toward the middle of my abdomen and back, then back to the left again. I never had the severe, sharp stabbing pains that many report with rupturing cysts. I am 27 years old and have only had one period since giving birth to my daughter a year ago (I was breastfeeding until recently). Also, the last two days I have had a mild fever (around 99 degrees).I am concerned that this isn't getting better and that the doctors don't really know that it's a cyst, they are just guessing. Any advice for me?","Doctor":"Hello, thanks  for the query to H. C. M. C. Usually ovarian cyst ( one or multiple)  is asymptomatic ( no complaint). One yr back you delivered a child so at least this cyst in not interfering in ovarian function of that side  where it present. Loss of appetite and nausea and now 99 degrees temp. This is the cause of concern. Pain is also on the left side and slightly moving to  middle of abdomen and than back. In this situation only one possible reason is Amoebic colitis or worm infestation. 2nd reason may be gastritis causing nausea and loss of appetite. Appetizers and antacids can improve your condition. If no relief than consult a doctor and get blood examination, will find exact reason of disease. Good luck Dr. HET."},{"Patient":"My daughter has thrush (age 4) she has been suffering with this on and off for over 3 months and had a water infection about a month ago, she is now showing signs of another water infection (frequent toilet with just a dribble and stinging sensation) the GP says this is just thrush and we should just continue to use the cream prescribed 6 weeks ago that we have been using on and off since prescribed, he did not test her urine so how does he know she does not have another urine infection?","Doctor":"Hello,As per your complaint thrush is a fungal infection, and it can reoccur if the previous infection has not yet subsided, and also if the child is being given antibiotics for some infection. Also, frequent urination and dribbling urine and stinging can be due to urine infection, and you should get a urine culture done for it.I would suggest you first consult a pediatric dentist, and get evaluated and he can do microscopy of the scraping from the tongue done to confirm that it is thrush. In case if it is thrush, then you have to continue applying antifungal mouth paint like Candid mouth paint and along with it gives plenty of probiotics like Yogurt and garlic. Feed with plenty of fluids.Hope I have answered your query.

If the kid's activity is good and feeding is appropriate when he is not having fever, then  you need not worry. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my daughter is 6 weeks old and we just noticed a red spot on the back of her head. its about the size of a 50 cent piece. im just guessing its from here crib or car seat, because its right were it rests when she lays down. we hold her alot because she crys if we dont, its just weird and would like to know if we should take her in or not its not painful to her","Doctor":"Hi...it could just be an erythema due to the pressure.

I decided to consult an ENT specialist who requested for a PNS x-ray. The X-ray has shown adenoid hypertropy and the ENT specialist has recommended for the removal of the adenoids. Of course I m jittery about this especially when I think of General anethesia. Do you think the surgery is important? Thank you. Esther from Tulaga, Kenya","Doctor":"Hi. Sorry to hear about the problems of little kid. As far as your question is concerned , if the diagnosis of adenoids has been confirmed by an ENT doctor and surgical removal has been advised by a specialist then its better to go with that. In the other scenerio , the kid may have these problems repeatedly. Secondly you have concerns about general anaesthesia in a kid. Let me tell you that now a days due to advancement in medical sciences, general anaesthesia in kids is a common practice and routinely given by qualified anaesthetists. So i would suggest you to stay assured and go for the surgical option. It would be better for the health of kid.

PLEASE STOP ANTIBIOTICS. THIS IS NOT STOMACH INFECTION.... PASSING STOOLS AFTER FOOD IS GASTROCOLIC REFLEX.What your kid is having is not a diarrhea and is only a gastro-colic reflux. It is quite common for babies of this age group t pass small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhea and especially antibiotics are not indicated.When the baby takes milk , the stomach expands - then when it is contracting it sets off a wave form which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum, a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out.

He is overweight; his also is a picky eater. My other concern is that he doesn’t eat his 3 meals a day, sometimes he doesn’t eat for two days, but he drinks lot liquids.

Does the kid have any bleeding along with hard stools?4. How much milk does the kid consume per day?5. Does the kid eat fruits and vegetables (fibre diet) appropriately?You can get back with answers at the following link -www.healthcaremagic.com/doctors/dr-sumanth-amperayani/67696Suggestions:1. Natural methods are the best to relieve constipation.2. Constipation is a risk factor for UTI3. Maximum milk consumption per day should not exceed 300-400ml4.

This just looks like a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day.

Yesterday I noticed her lymph glands were terribly swollen and she was having a hard time swollowing. She also had a small white sore on her tongue. I took her to urgent care and was told she was teething. They said her nose, ears, and throat were all clear. Today I attempted to brush her teeth and blood went everywhere from her gums and she screamed. As much as I can see, her gums look very red and swollen. They look like they might be infected.. They look painful. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.","Doctor":"hello ,Thank you for posting your query with healthcaremagic,First of all, I would like to appreciate you for taking your daughter to urgent care in order to make sure, things are under normal circumstances,Also, I would like you to know that during teething period it is quite common for kids to have fever, swollen/red gums, if you could offer you daughter cold teething toys(keep it in fridge for sometime) in order for her to chew on it which will sooth her gums down.Also, giving your daughter tylenol for fever will help her a lot. If she has any known allergies, kindly see the pediatrician before giving her tylenol.But if you feel, there is an infection in her gums, I will advise you to see pediatrician again , because kids are prone to infections when their immunity goes down ,as they are not eating well during teething period.Bleeding from gums while trying to brush , could be because they are sore/swollen right now.   Don't worry, kids do go through this phase which is temporary,I wish your daughter healthy day,If you have any more questions feel free to right us back.thank youwith warm regards,Dr. Anshika Taneja"},{"Patient":"My daughter has polands syndrome, she is 7 weeks old and is missing her right pectoral muscle and her nipple is absent.

I have had a constant/consistent itchy like ache in my upper abdomen for the better part of 2 yrs (+/-) that has been diagnosed as things from I.B.S. to anxiety . I was even told at one point that it is in my head, by about the 3rd different Dr. I was sent to see. After lots of tests, medications , poking and prodding, I still haven t been given a clear answer. I gave up on seeking treatment, because the pain became way easier to deal with than the embarrassment, after my last Dr. suggested we should look into a medication for my head. Basically assuring me that my abdomen pain is a figment of my imagination, and that its actually my mind that hurts. The shame of this has caused me to give up on my health and focus on numbing the pain with alcohol. I know its only making it worse, but it gives me a few moments of relief. I honestly am not an alcoholic, but a person desperate to not be in pain. Even if its short lived. I am terrified that whatever is wrong, can be fixed before its too late, but I can only go to the finest Dr. s that my insurance (county medi-cal) will allow. I even recieve SSD for it, yet I ve never been properly diagnosed. Yet another reason I feel like they think it s in my head. I feel so alone, and stupid because whatever this is, is taking away my ability to function normally. I am so tired and wore out all of the time.

I have had chronic abdominal pain for the past 3 years which my doctors still can't find a reason for. I have no energy, low sex drive, pain during intercourse, no periods ( I stopped taking the depo injection 7 months ago) and have had unexplained weight loss. Any help would be appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. As you have been taking depomedrone for some time, it has caused adrenal insufficiency. It is because you have blocked with the medicine naturally stimulating adrenals hormone called ACTH. If such situation is chronic, it is called Addisons disease. The main symptoms of it are weight lost, weakness and darker skin. Depending on how long you have been taking depomedrone, it will take up to few months to make your adrenals start working (if adrenals are not permanently destroyed). I suggest you to visit endocrinologist and have adrenals blood tests performed. Severe abdominal pain can be related to your steroids intake. However pain during intercourse and abdominal pain are characteristic for endometriosis symptoms. Especially if your pain is cramps like, you get bloated abdomen, diarrhea and constipation alternately. Such symptoms do appear with endometriosis because it causes severe inflammation in the abdominal cavity what leads to abdominal adhesions. This adhesions give partial bowel obstruction. Sometimes it is very hard to diagnose it. I suggest you to have colonoscopy, abdominal CT with oral contrast (called enteroclysis). This two tests will tell if there are any narrow areas in the small and large intestine. If nothing will be found in this tests, you should discuss with your doctor about diagnostic laparoscopy (sometimes it is the only way to diagnose endometriosis). Hope this will help.

But also this is usual after such surgical procedures and you should be worried. Few weeks are necessary till your periods become balanced. If you notice bleeding beyond time of periods, lower abdominal sharp pain or fever you should visit doctor. If not, just be patient and everything will be fine. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"My child, who is 2 years old now, has always from the time she was born had some sort of small cough. Her pediatrician has never been concerned about it and always related it to colds she got from daycare or teething. Just recently, she has begun coughing more, to the point where she throws up phlegm and then whatever she ate previously. She has experienced this at least once per day for the last week or so. Not sure if this is relevant, but she did contract pneumonia one day after birth and was treated in the NICU for 3 weeks before recovering fully. She also had a barium swallow test during her time in NICU and it was confirmed that she also had reflux. She was never treated for it as she never spit up her milk. Could what she is going through now be reflux? Asthma or is there someting else to be concerned about??","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic. Greetings from Chennai.By what you quote I feel what your kid could be having viral associated wheeze or multi triggered wheeze. I have a few questions for you -Questions:1.

Does she feel breathless when she runs around or plays with other kids?4. Are the symptoms when there are seasonal changes?5. Is there any family history of asthma or any other sort of allergies like skin allergy etc.?6. Is the cough always associated with fever?If your answer is yes for any of the above questions, your kid might be having viral associated wheezing or multi triggered wheezing and I suggest you meet a paediatric pulmonologist who is near your place.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my six year old has a spattering of small bruises at the base of his spine. he doesn t remember getting them....he had bloodwork recently (as he has lost about 2 lbs in the past few months) and all came back normal. any thoughts or suggestions? plan on going to the dr. obviously, just a worried mom hoping to get some sleep tonight :)","Doctor":"Hi.... spontaneous bruising with weight loss should not be ignored and definitely be investigated.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. As you said you have missed period six months back and pregnancy test was negative, used deviry and everything is normal. The problem is with your tummy which became large and ugly. The active ingredient of the tablet is a steroid, and can have water retention property, as well as fat accumulation property. That might be the cause of your tummy. I advise you to consult a physician for diagnosis and treatment. After taking MRI and other routine tests your doctor will come to a conclusion of what is the cause of the change. If the cause is the hormone tablets, if you stop them you be relieved of the tummy. Other causes could be liver enlargement, routine accumulation of the fat, or pregnancy in spite of the regular periods, etc. Hope I have answered your query.

You are 24 and married female, Upto 4 months back your periods were regular, but since that time they are scanty brownish in color. This is all suggest some infection, or poly cystic ovarian syndrome etc. I advise you to consult a gynacologist for diagnosis and treatment. If it is infection, it is better to use the medicines by both the partners to prevent relapse. If it is P.C.O.S. you alone can use medicines . You may need to have a U.S.scanning besides other routine tests for confirmation . Wishing for a quick and complete recovery, and thanks for calling H.C.M.F.

She play with toys and obey our instruction. But at the age of 2 Year she got ear infection & fever(106) , doctor advised that give her shower with fresh water ASAP to control his fever as well advised some antibiotics .

First one the acid peptic disease which is due to excessive acid secretion and resolves with the use of antacids. Second and the most common one is cholecystitis which is the inflammation of the gall bladder which may or may not be due to stone formation. The third one is the liver disease which is most commonly due to hepatitis of any type. All these conditions can be ruled out by an ultrasonography of the abdomen and if nothing detected then it is acid peptic disease. you can use domeperidone or spasmodin for pain and antacids for digestive problems Thanks Regards"},{"Patient":"Q)my son suffering with fever from yesterday morning.my local pediatrician give crocin syrup 4ml when ever temp 102&above. after given dosage temp dropped to normal.again temp raised after 6 hours 100-102. upto now i give dosage when temp raises.this will continue upto temperature normal .otherwise i go to doctor","Doctor":"fever is not the disease its a manifestation of disease.

If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all.Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days.

Over the past 2months he has woken in the morning with a nose bleed and subsequently passed out.  This morning he passed out again even though the nose bleed was hardly anything at all (just a bit of blood on his hand).  Could it be that he is just squeamish about his own blood?Thanks","Doctor":"Hi...by what you quote, I feel that the bleeding could be any other simple epistaxis, just applying pressure will do most of the times. But if it is recurrent, then it needs evaluation like checking of blood pressure and investigations for bleeding disorder.Regarding the passing out, I feel it could be a vagal attack for fear of seeing blood, especially own blood.

I am also experiencing upper abdominal pain. My everyday life is very painful all day. It's been going on for a little over a month now. If any insight on what it might be please respond. Thank you","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting your query. Do you have some mass palpable at anus? With the available described details, there could be possibility of thrombosed hemorrhoids or anal fissure. Aggravation of pain due to coughing or sneezing could be due to active wound at anus and persistent injury. You should consult with internal medicine specialist/ general surgeon and should go for thorough check up. You should go for per rectal examination also. Treatment of anal fissure and hemorrhoids differ and treatment depends on exact diagnosis. Meanwhile, you should take plenty of water along with laxative containing isapgula and lactitol. Laxative helps in relieving constipation and cure of local wound. You should also apply lignocaine ointment along with diltiazem. You should also perform hot sitz bath; put lukewarm water in a tub and sit in it for 15-20 minutes twice in a day. This helps in relaxation of anal sphincters.

As per your complain in case if there is pain in teeth on taking both hot and cold foods then it is most probably due to deep infection or decay in teeth and will need Root Canal Treatment..Yes, it is true that for Root Canal Treatment, the dentist has to give anaesthesia but it is a local anaesthesia and only the area of the treatment is made numb in this case..If you are asked to go to Rainbow hospital for getting anaesthesia then it is possible that he wants to do the treatment in general anaesthesia to make your child sleep..Although nothing is wrong in even that as toddlers are anxious and will not co-operate in treatment, so general anaesthesia eases the treatment procedure..But my suggestion is to consult a Paediatric dentist or Pedodontist and get evaluated and first you should get an attempt to get the treatment done in local anaesthesia or conscious sedation..In case if the child does not co-operate at all then only proceed to General Anaesthesia..Hope this information helps..Thanks and regards..Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora.."},{"Patient":"My 2 1/2 month old has been demonstrating the signs of teething for a few weeks, how long might it take for a tooth to come through?

I abuse alcohol about 1-3 glasses a night. And before that I used to vape marijuana everyday. I had no problems with it until one day I had an anxiety attack. Idk if you ve ever partaken but once you have a bad trip its all about mind over high. Its going to try to creep up on you again because it s always going to be in the back of your mind. Well. Anyways. I eventually had to stop. Then I tried again. And I was fine. Until I started getting really bad burning sensations and burping alot afterwards and that would send me spiraling into a freak out. I have had acid reflux most of my life and I get heart palptations from time to time. I think I may have higher than normal blood pressure. I was with a friend and experimented with not inhaling deeply. Rather letting the thc absorb into my esophagus rather than my lungs. My question is. Is it possible for marijuana smoke and or vape. To irritate my g.i. System enough to cause excessive belching and or burning chest and racing heartbeat . I cant be sure if the racing and pounding heartbeat is involved with the stomach problems but sometimes I have problems. Other times I don t. I love marijuana. I don t like the oh its wrong stereotype. People drink alcohol, smoke cigs, and take seriously messed up medications everyday. Im not an addict. I ve quit many many times. I just like how it enhances the video games I play or the way it can light up a conversation with new people or old friends.","Doctor":"Hi dear ! I think the reason for your gastro intestinal irritation is your intake of alcoholic drinks regularly. Apart from that you are also used to take marijuanha often. All combined , your GI tract gets irritated and hyper stimulated. You may get anxiety attacks due to abuse of any kind of addictive drugs/alcohol. Well dear, no excuse is a good enough for getting hooked to alcohol or any drugs. It is your body and mind and you have to take good care of it to keep it running well. I would strongly suggest you to contact de addicting centres or a good consellor/clinical psychiatrist at the earliest to get help."},{"Patient":"My ten year old daughter passed out for a few seconds last week I took her to her doctor and he said she could be dehydrated but did not test anything he just took her pulse and listened to her heart and she did not have a fever. Today I took her to the daughter because her pierced earring hole is infected. We now have an antibiotic for that. I am still worried about her passing out and she has been complaining of a stomachache and backache. Should I take her to the emergency room if she faints again or to get some blood tests?","Doctor":"Hi there,I understand your concern, and I agree that if she has repeated episodes of passing out/fainting, that she should have it investigated.  The most common things that we have to rule out are heart and rhythm problems, which is why the doctor checked that first when he examined her.  I usually do not proceed much further myself with a single episode of fainting, because it is not uncommon, especially if triggered by things like dehydration or illness.However, if there are recurrent episodes, then we need to be sure that there are no other problems.  This is especially so if they are what we call spontaneous episodes, which means that there was no trigger - she was completely well, eating and drinking enough, did not have any awkward positioning or movements, and just suddenly passes out.  Other than heart problems, the other category that we need to investigate are seizure disorders, which can present as just fainting spells.  Ask her if she remembers what happened before she faints, any sensations, lights, palpitations.Usually, if she is otherwise well, an appointment with a cardiologist first will be adequate if she faints again.  However, in your daughter's case, she seems to be ill with the stomachache and backache, so I would recommend the emergency room if she faints again this week.  I think that if she faints again so soon, we need to look at what is triggering her, for example whether she has another infection besides the ear piercing.  A urine infection can present in this way, is she prone to urine infections or constipation?  A regular viral fever can also look like this, although a virus is less likely if she doesn't have a fever.  Has she had her menstruation yet, could that be an issue?Make sure she drinks enough water, it keeps her volume up so that even if she is unwell, there is a good buffer before she gets to the point where she faints.Hope this helps, please let me know if you have further questions.Regards,Dr. Teh"},{"Patient":"My daughter just fell on our metal bed frame and banged the spot between her nose and her forehead and between her eyebrows. It looks alittle swollen and looks like there might be bruising behind skin. We iced it and all she wants is to go to bed which we obliged. Should we be concerned? Anything we can do or be aware of?","Doctor":"Hi there,You did well by icing it early, there is usually not much else to do for bumps such as this.  Some paracetamol for the pain would be useful if it bothers her, but if she can sleep fine, then there is no need.Things to watch out for would be signs of internal injury, like nosebleeds, repeated vomiting, severe headache, irritability, or drowsiness (more than you would expect) to the point of it being difficult to wake her up.  This is quite unlikely, from how her injury sounds, but you should still keep an eye on her for the next 24 hours or so.Also note that if there is significant swelling, the bruising will highly likely track down around her eyes over the next few days.  This is normal due to gravity and the loose fatty tissue around the eyes, and she might look like she has been punched in the face, but it will soon fade.Hope this helps, and keep well.Regards,Dr. Teh"},{"Patient":"My 8 month old baby over the last two days has had her tongue turn black, starting in the back and moving forward.

We are NOT on a juice only diet we are on our regular food diet but just started incorporating about a cup and a half of vegetable only juice everyday.  The first 4 1/2 months were fine but all of a sudden after drinking my juice one evening, I started with severe abdominal pain and bloating.  I was belching continuously and kept feeling like i would vomit.  None of the vegetables were any different than what we normally juice ( a combination of parsley, spinach, cucumbers, capsicum, carrots, beets etc).  Also the kids were fine and continue to be till today but I have gotten this every single day for the last 2 weeks.   I kept trying because was not convinced it was the juice since it made no sense that I would suddently develop this intolerance so I started eliminating 1 vegetable everynight till I was down to just cucumbers last night and I still suffered the same symptoms!  No symptoms eating the whole vegetables even in huge quantities and nothing else has changed. Kids still fine with all vegetables.  I'm wondering what happened.  Any ideas?","Doctor":"Hi welcome to Health care magic forum. Thanks for choosing H.C.M.F.

I am not clear whether you have tried with out cucumber juice.

With the available described symptoms, there could be possibility of hunger pains more but appendicitis must be ruled out. Relief of abdominal pain after eating suggests the diagnosis. You should consult with internal medicine specialist/ general surgeon and should go for thorough check up.

I have sent my husband to get gastrolite but want to know if there is anything else I should do.  I keep giving him water also but he throws it up.","Doctor":"Hi there,It is unlikely that it was due to motion sickness, because of the diarrhoea and fever.  It is probably a virus, or food poisoning.  The most important thing to do right now is to control the vomiting, because he can't keep dehydration at bay if he's vomiting everything back up.Get an anti-vomiting medication like domperidone or metoclopramide from a a local pharmacy, and give it to him immediately after an episode of vomiting to minimise the chances of him throwing it back up.  If he can keep it down for at least 30 minutes then it has a chance to work.  Don't take anything else in the meantime.Once that is controlled, get him to sip small amounts of plain water or rehydration salts, or if he prefers something familiar, even Gatorade or other non-carbonated isotonic drinks are fine.  Give him some paracetamol if the fever is high over 38'C.Don't worry about food until he actually feels like eating.  Start plain with bread or crackers, then move on only when he tolerates it well.  Avoid dairy and proteins like meat and eggs until he recovers from his diarrhoea.Most episodes of food poisoning or viral gastroenteritis will resolve on its own with no other treatment.

It always starts with the symptoms of a uti, and the drs can find no infection or anything until she spikes a fever. She s on a high fiber diet, and is very regular with her bowel movements, yet still has this trouble. Last time the xray revealed that her colon was stretched. Drs are stumped. Any idea what it could be?","Doctor":"Hi there,The backed up stool and tendency to urinary tract infection does point to the idea that she could be constipated, despite being regular.  Regarding the frequency of bowel movements, do note that different people tend to have different bowel needs, up to 3 times a day is accepted as normal.  So she could actually be going daily and still be relatively constipated.What we are aiming for is the right consistency of stools, which is long and sausage-like, with or without cracks.  If you need more visual guidance, look for the Bristol stool chart online, and aim for Type 3 or 4.  It is good that she is taking enough fibres, but also pay attention to her habits and stress to her that she needs to go when she feels like it even if it is more than once a day.  Constipation often occurs at this age because this is when they are getting better at holding it in, and prefer other exciting activities to sitting in the toilet.The other rarer possibility would be that she has a mild form of Hirschsprung's disease, which means that some nerves are missing from the end of the colon, making the evacuating of stool difficult.  Most people have this diagnosed as babies, but if it's very mild it can be missed.  It might be more likely if she had delayed bowel movement more than a day after birth, or had tendency to constipation even as a baby.  You will have to discuss with your doctor on this possibility, because confirmation would be needed with a rectal biopsy.Hope this helps, and all the best to you.Regards,Dr. Teh"},{"Patient":"my kid of 10 yrs has seasonal allergy leading to endless coughing & increased respiration . so we have to nebulise him 3 times a day.. doctor advised to give montair ic . other doctor said its preventive medicine, it can t be given in this condition. pl. advice","Doctor":"Hi there,I understand your concern, and I would like to assure you that the Montair is appropriate for him at this time.  Montair, or montelukast can be taken for allergies and asthma both as a relief and maintenance therapy.  It all depends on how long he will be exposed to the allergens.  In fact, it would suit him if it is very clearly a seasonal type allergy, because then he can take it throughout the pollen season, and stop it the rest of the year.What the other doctor means is that it is not appropriate for immediate rescue the way a nebuliser can be used, because it takes a few hours to even be absorbed.  If your son is very breathless, it probably will not work fast enough, much like how an antihistamine is not meant to stop the allergy immediately.You should find that adding on Montair will make him need the nebuliser less frequently, because it brings down the general level of allergic reaction in the body.  I will repeat that it is not meant to replace the nebuliser, which is a short term rescue solution when he is breathless.  Hopefully, just decreasing the need for nebulisers will make his allergy more manageable through the season.Hope this helps, and all the best to you.Regards,Dr. Teh"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

After these 2 treatments, she still has fluid in her ears and we are supposed to go back to France (from NYC) tomorrow night. The ENT specialist I saw said it s not safe, she could become deaf, but after doing research on the internet, I don t see anything about deafness related to fluid and planes. Moreover I talked to a French doctor who said the there was easy procedure with tubes that could solve the problem, and that the baby would be able to fly after 2 days. So I could just delay my return a little. But the ENT specialist here mentioned this tubes operation as a big procedure. What do you think? thanks a lot","Doctor":"Hi there,I understand the predicament that you are in, and yes, an operation to put tubes in the ears is actually a fairly simple procedure.  However, an operation is still an operation, and comes with its risks of anaesthesia and bleeding and such.  If she has repeated infections, or if she is ill despite treatment for this infection, then the procedure is probably warranted to help drain any pus or make the drops work better.  But if she has recovered fairly well, I would agree with the ENT and hesitate to put her through anaesthesia just to catch a flight.Regarding flying with the fluid in the ears, you first have to understand what caused the fluid to begin with.  The middle ear is usually an area that is filled with air, and the Eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the throat, equalising the pressure inside with the outside air.  In children the Eustachian tube doesn't function so well and is prone to be blocked with secretions.  This causes fluid buildup, sometimes even after the infection has improved.Essentially, what we have is a closed space filled with a mix of air and fluids, much like a balloon.  What happens during a flight is that the drop in surrounding air pressure is going to force the space to expand and the most flexible part, the eardrum, will be pushed out, with the risk of causing a ruptured eardrum.  Most people heal spontaneously in the weeks and months after the rupture, and I wouldn't say flying is completely forbidden, but it is likely that she will be in quite a bit of pain through the flight.I understand that it might not be practical to wait until the fluid clears to go home, and if you do decide to fly, prep her with some paracetamol beforehand to minimise the pain.  Also, give her something to snack, drink or suck on during takeoff.  The swallowing action increases the chances that her Eustachian tube will somehow pop open for a brief period, enough to equalise the pressure temporarily.  Do the same during landing as well.Hope this helps, and all the best to you and your daughter.Regards,Dr. Teh"},{"Patient":"Hello, i am having abdominal pain since last two weeks. i also feel breathless often.

As you describe you had bad stomach pain after eating anything, and an urge to go to stools, and there is blood in stools. There is a history of carcinoid tumour, of iliocecal junction.

I'm here because I don't want to be taken to the doctor's or anything by my dad. I feel like I may be depressed but I'm not sure. I feel as if my dad were to know that I'm depressed(If I am) he might think I'm stupid for thinking such a thing. So point is, I think I might be depressed. I've been feeling really uninspired lately, and this would be like the fourth time in my life. I've been thinking about suicide a lot lately. Like I said, this wouldn't be the first time. The first time I felt like this I was in the fifth grade, and I was just really depressed for some reason. It may have been because my family was having a lot of problems, and my parents were fighting a lot. I started pinching myself a lot (I was in fifth grade I didn't know about anything, I was just hurting myself because it made me feel better). My family was in California at the time. We moved back to New Jersey and my parent's got divorced here, which wasn't a problem for me at all, I was completely fine with it, and I moved in with my dad. The next time was for no particular reason at all. I was just really bored with life, and I felt nothing, and like nothing. My dad is really overprotective so I'm not allowed to do anything. I just walk home from the bus stop which is two blocks away, and then I stay home all day. I only go to my friend's house on the weekends, and I never go outside during the week unless it's for school. I got over that depression because I liked this kid and I went out with him and yeah. He made me happy so I guess I got better. But I didn't like him anymore so I broke up with him or whatever. The next time was when I had a LOT of feelings for this one guy. I'm not sure if you could say I was \\"in love\\" with him because, well, I'm only 13 but it really felt like it. He had a girlfriend though but we had a really, really strong relationship. Something happened where we couldn't really talk and we started drifting apart. Like REALLY apart. I began getting all depressed and listening to all this depressing music, yada yada. And after that I felt like nothing and so unwanted and everything and I started hurting myself again. No one knows and I don't want to tell anyone 'cause I feel like they won't care, or they'll think I'm weak and stupid for hurting myself. But then I just started getting over it and I got better. But now it's happening again. I feel so trapped and I can't do anything and I really want to go out and chill with some friends or something. I'm not saying every day, but every once in a while. But my dad is so strict and it's really not fair. Okay now I'm just complaining and I know it's not necessary. But yeah. I just want to know, and I want help.

Then at 3 weeks old he contracted RSV and an ear infection and when he recovered his illness, the crying fits intensified. Now he is fussy whenever he is awake. During sleep, he is restless and wakes himself up after a few minutes. During his fits, he gets red in the face, increases his volume, and hold his breath if I don't immediately get to him. When I do pick him up, he is only content if he is held up right on my shoulder. He also wants to nurse constantly. I am worried there is something wrong with him. This is aggravated by the fact that his father has pernicious anemia due to lack of intrinsic factor and my son's pediatrician will not test my son to make sure he did not inherit this condition. Is my son's behavior normal?","Doctor":"Your son's behavior seems to be normal colicsColic in newborns is defined as crying more than 3 hrs per day, 3 days per week, atleast.You must be committed to your pediatricians well care visits, and a Weight Growth Chart is plotted to check for your baby's feeding adequacy.Holding him on your shoulder and tapping gently till he burps,  is very important; this causes the gases he swallows along with feeding to be collected at the top of gastric fluid and expelled (burped).Good feeding techniques is very essential especially for breast feed infants."},{"Patient":"Hello, my nine year old just said that just the left side of her left eye was going blurry and she was seeing things that weren t there, now she says it has stopped, but her head hurts.

How long has the headache been there?2. Does it occur always on forehead or keeps changing?3. Is it associated with blurring of eyes or double vision or giddiness?4. Is there any family history of migraine or single side headache?5. Is he very angry when he gets headache and does the ache get better after a good sleep?6.

There is no scientific proof as yet to make these levels point to a diagnosis. Diet does not have much to do with it.It is claimed by proponents of alternative medicine that Carnosine and anserine is helpful in treating autism, though there is no such proven clinical evidence and we do not recommend its use. Have you, by any chance, been giving your child any such supplements containing Carnosine and anserine? This may have led to an increased level.Regarding diet, a child with autism can be given any diet, which contains adequate amounts of all nutrients, just like any other child.The finding of a 'protein missing in your blood' should be looked into, but it most likely has nothin to do with Carnosine and anserine  levels, which are not part of the proteins that are looked for when testing a blood sample!

It does occur on the right side and back also. I had a episode of diverticulitis 5 months ago recent colonscopy showed abscess had healed, I ve had a C-section , hysterectomy and a abdomio pasty, I cannot sleep on left side hurts to much. The pain is off and on all day. It changes from stabbing to needling to feeling like bee stings. I have diarrhea lasting for days or mushy bowel movements that I have to strain to get started. I have yellow muscus w/blood or heavy bleeding.","Doctor":"Hi welcome to Health care magic forum. Thanks for choosing H.C.M.F. As you describe you have left sided pain, some times present in right side and back also, if you sleep on left side it hurts, you have diarrhea lasting for days, with mucous and blood. You had C.section,  hysterectomy, and abdominoplasty.Recent colonoscopy showed that the diverticulitis of 5months old has healed . It appears that the diverticulitis can show some effects depending on the internal tissue condition. Or there may be amoebic colitis with recent infection. I advise you to follow some diet recommendations as eat only curd rice or bread for few days, when you feel comfertable start taking bland foods with out spices and gastric irritants. avoid taking junk foods, and oily foods.

Congenital airway anomaly - this causes noisy breathing (both inspiratory and expiratory noise, actually inspiratory will be more than expiratory noise). But the child will not struggle to breath and there will not be fast breathing and in-drawing of chest wall. The sound will be more heard during sleeping and feeding.2. Wheezing - Here the sound will be predominantly expiratory; the kid will be struggling to breathe, might turn blue and require oxygen and may have chest wall in-drawing.But both are associated with recurrent cough and cold. But these might not always be bacterial infections which require antibiotics and usually are predominantly viral and are self-limiting.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2.

His head and chest is more warmer and legs and hands are cold as usual.","Doctor":"Hi thanks for posting on HCM. I understand your worry. According to your description it's likely that your baby has developed an acute infection probably viral gastroenteritis as he passes watery loose stool. Fever is due to the infection. In infants it's usually head and trunk become more warm as their surface area to body ratio is high than adults. In other words more heat is passing out from larger surface areas like head and neck. However if  the baby continues to have loose stool he might get dehydrated and which can manifest as cold peripheries like hand and feet, in that case you should seek immediate medical attention as some time he may need IV Saline to prevent hypovolemic shock. So if you feel his hands and feet unusually cold its better to admit him to hospital soon. If he can take orally (oral rehydration fluids)  to compensate what he looses he may be fine and infection usually settled by day 3 to 5. However if the baby become I'll looking and less active he should have blood counts done to exclude bacterial sepsis as well. Hope the answer is helpful.

Thanks for choosing H.C.M.F. As you describe your 19 year daughter had stomach pain, watery brown diarrhoea, black purple vomit, When she blows tarry black on the tissue. The description suggests that there is heavy infection in in the intestines, with probable blood oosing  in intestines, it happens when there is much cramping or more infection.

Heart murmurs are very common in children and most are innocent especially if your grand daughter has grown up adequately for her age and can play normally. Therefore heart murmur cannot explain low body temperature. Are you sure about temperature measurement technique or the thermometer?

The generic name of the drug is Desloratadine which has less side effects when compared to old antihistamines. Recurrent coughing especially at night in this age  is commonly due to wheezing. To improve wheezing cough the child should be on a broncodilator or in long run on a steroid. Antihistamines can't relieve cough due to bronchospasms due to wheezing even though it can reduce allergy symptoms and respiratory secretions. However it's not said that antihistamine increases cough. Increasing symptoms may probably due to worsening wheezing and not due to the drug.

However this is a very common chronic recurrent condition which can be controlled by antihistamine and anti allergies treatment. But if your kid gets very frequent attacks which disturb her usual life it's better to consult an immunologist who can asses the severity of symptoms and to start a long term prophylaxis treatment; also in the mean time he might do some important tests to find exact identifiable allergens for your kid. Her abdominal pain can be due to allergy induced enlarged  lymph nodes in the tummy .  Hope the answer is helpful.

You had endometriosis, goitre, cervical disc prolapse, and abnormal smears. A week latter you had a uncontrolled urge for sex. It appears to be secondary to the harmones treatment, or increase in endogenous eostrogen harmone due to some pathology in the ovaries. Goitre if hyperactive can have the same symptoms.

This is not infection in the chest. This is just common cold.Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in children. For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.For cold you can use Cetrizine at 0.25mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days.For nasal block, plain saline nasal drops will do, every 4-6th hourly to relive nasal congestion.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

After the last vomiting episode they fed him jello and seemed to keep that down. No fever today. Just constant crying.Should they take him to e.r.","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.It seems your kid is having viral diarrhoea. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do. Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridges & soups.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day.

The source of blood is commonly from the nose, which can dry out and produce small amounts of blood during colds. So, in general, this is nothing to be overly concerned about. However, if it persists beyond 48-72 hours, it's worth being seen by your doctor for precautionary purposes."},{"Patient":"My 3 month old baby was kind of fussy and I was holding her trying to feed her and she just kept screaming and when I looked down at her right leg it was bright red so I touched it and it was really warm.

Acute- and convalescent-phase titers are more sensitive than a single serum sample. the diagnosis is based on clinical picture , blood / bone marrow cultures.if you are living in area which is epidemic in typhoid infections , and no other diagnosis is possible by physical exam and history and blood and bone marrow cultures are not available I suggest starting on injectable 3rd generation Cephalosporin instead of ofloxacin  ( zo50) because typhoid has resistance to this antibiotic , keeping in mind that fever may remain 3-5 days even during the treatment .I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi, my 7 month old baby is suffering from a bad cough since last thursday accompanied by a fever.

Will his voice get well as soon as he recovers from the cough?","Doctor":"I will like to answer your concern ,your child is most likely suffering from CROUP! it is a viral illness in which there is cough and change in voice as you mentioned already .The yellow green phlegm is also due to virus involving the nose and throat .So you can support your child cough and secretion by having nebulisation (steam inhalation) through a medicine called epinephrine ,you should go to hospital for having this medicine ."},{"Patient":"my daughter is 2 1/2 years old and has strep c (we found out yesterday). she was given penicillin injections last night in the ER and has not urinated for about 12 hours. she slept most the day today and has consumed about 18 oz. of liquid. should we be concerned about her not urinating","Doctor":"hi , I must ask first if this strep c was found in the blood culture or a throught culture, because septicemia caused by strep c can cause dehydration and decrease blood flow to kidneys which decreases urination , another serious cause is bilateral renal artery thrombosis due to septicemia, it's less common but very worrisome, I recommend a renal function test , serum electrolytes and admission to the hospital.

Last month on 11th of march he was admitted to hopital by the specialist for the treatment of ARI and suspected case of meningitis, because Dr. Wrote on the prescription, movement of eye balls, irritation, poor feeding and baby had so much stiffness and moving head downward when picking in hands. After admission they took a blood report in which his HB was 9.8, Lymphocyts was 50 and tlc was also a bit high. Before admission he was also taking the antibiotics Rocephin, Kalarcid and Hizonate.

I’m not a regular person I usually go once every four or five day's.  Some times before I go at least 1 in every 3 I will get very strong abdominal pains, the last six months or so they have got worse.  They are now that strong I can not stand it will bring me to my knees and think I'm going to faint or be sick.  I will then go to the toilet and my motion is the same as normal just a normal stool formed.  Obviously there is a lot but it’s been 4 to 6 days before I have been.  A few time there has been mucus some time yellowish some time clear but this is occasionally (in fact every half a dozen times I go) and again very occasionally there has been a deep redness to the poop which I believe to be blood but this has only happened a couple of times in the last couple of years.  I have an ok diet and the pains are not always in the morning times they can happen at any time but I would hazard a guess at 70% morning time.  I went to AE the other day with what I thought was the start of appendix on my right side and are now booked in for a barium enima.  I have the usual pains all around my stomach area which I have never associated with my intestines before I just thought my fallopian tubes where going to explode or rumbling appendix then it all goes away.  It’s not very often I get diarrhoea and I do not get rock hard motion how ever sometime I have had to push into my bum cheek as I feel the stool are not inline with the rectum to pass through. After doing some research into what the Barium Enima is testing for, has made me think there could be other complications!!  Is any one else out there got the same symptoms and if you have what was the diagnosis. I am 40 years of age with 3 kids between 8 and 5.   Can you put my mind to rest?","Doctor":"Hi ! From your history, the following actions could be suggested : 1) Get your stool tested for bacterial/amebic infections and if positive, you will get relief with proper medications by your doctor. 2) If the above doesnot help you, go for a CECT scan abdomen for ruling out inflammatory bowel diseases. 3) If you suspect appendix by any chance, I will not advise you to go for a barium enema."},{"Patient":"My toddler had a rash in his diaper area that spread up his abdomen and back, it appeared to look like hives.

It seems that your son has developed a dermoid cyst between the eyebrows. Dermoid cyst is a cavity under the skin that is filled with dead skin and other cells that usually make the outer layer of the skin. The cyst might be present at the birth but it grows slowly so may have caused swelling after increase in size.The treatment of this swelling includes surgical excision, though the decision of when to do the surgery depend on the child's age, extent of the cyst, child's expected tolerance of the procedure and your own preference. You should consult a pediatric general surgeon for the clinical examination of the swelling and for discussion regarding the diagnosis and course of treatment. I hope this information helps you.

I suggest you see your pediatrician and get a rapid streptococcal antigen test done. If it is positive then she will require antibiotics. if it is negative then it might be viral illness and doesn't require antibiotics at all.Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in children. For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F.

An active is a well kid even if she/ he is not eating well.2. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone.3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day.4. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.5.

You are right in your information that Singulair is given for allergy and asthma symptoms in children. The child may have symptoms of asthma due to compression of the nasopharyngeal space.

I have been using Aveeno baby eczema but now it is stating to spread lower to his eyelids. I am considering using a hyrdocortizone but I m not sure if using it on his forehead is a very good idea. I m worried he will rub it in to his eyes.","Doctor":"Hi... I sympathize with the kid and understand your concern. By what you quote I feel that it could be eczema.  The trick of the management is keeping the skin moist and never allowing it to be dry. For this oil massage and lotions like Oilatum will help. Regarding cure options - eczema is a sort of allergy...allergies can only be controlled and can never be cured. But usually kids grow out of it...that is as the age progresses, they become better starting from 6 months.Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

I ate a fish sandwich around 12noon , threw it up around 4pm. And a piece of brownie around 7, threw it up a half hour later. On Tuesday I had diarrhea. And I threw up again on Wednesday . Now , I got a fever blister , cold sore , whatever it's called, on Monday afternoon , after my first vomit . It's now Saturday , I'm currently cramping , and I still have my fever blister/cold sore. Does the fever blister and stomach bug have any relation ???","Doctor":"Hi ! Possibly you have got a food poisoning somewhere due to which you have got vomiting and loose motions. Fever is due to any kind of infection, and food poisoning is one such example. The blister could come in due to fever caused by any infection, specially viral. Get your stool tested and consult your doctor.  All the best."},{"Patient":"My son who is 5.5years,108cms, 17.8kgs is frequently complaining of calf muscle and thigh muscle pain at night. Some nights he wakes up and i have to massage his legs to make it go away. what is the cause for this? he has about 200ml of milk and one medium bowl of yogurt everyday, besides fruits like bananas, apples and guava. He also has one boiled egg everyday and chicken/fish once a week. Is he deficient? he also has about 2 multivitamin gummies daily as recommended by his doctor.","Doctor":"Hi...by what you say this doesn't look like muscle pain. It looks like growth pain due to increase in height. You can use vitamin D supplements for this. This will improve by itself.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"hello i have a 3 year old and i found black dots in his right ear but i is not inside of his ear its on the outside.i tryed washing it with soup in water but i cant get him to stay still enough to wash it good but do you think it might be just blackheads?thats what i thougt it was at first but cant get anything to come up.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. If the black dots are painless and not having any other symptoms, they can be just moles like birth marks that do not require any treatment and should be accepted as part of the body. However, if the dots increase in size, swells up, ulcerates or cause any other symptoms, a dermatologist or physician should be consulted for clinical examination and further investigations.I hope this information helps you.

Based on the symptoms of your daughter, the prescription given by the treating doctor seems to be adequate to eliminate the infection and getting relief in symptoms of cold and cough.When antibiotics are prescribed, it takes 24-48 hours for the medicines to reach the desired blood levels and show desired effects in the body. As the antibiotics are started from yesterday only, I would advise you that you wait one more day for them to work in the body and help with the infection. Till then, combiflam suspension will relief in fever and other symptoms.

The hospital did not give any answers., Any help would be appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. Sticky saliva can be due to one many systemic disorders such as upper respiratory tract infection, oral cavity infection, fungal infection in the mouth, autoimmune disorders such as Sjogren's syndrome, gastric disorder etc.The problem cannot be solved until the underlying disorder is diagnosed and treated. As he finds difficult to draw breath, I recommend that you should see a pulmonologist first to rule our respiratory infections.If the respiration is fine, you should seek a pediatrician for check of other systems through investigations and treat them.I hope this information helps you.

It seems that the acid coming into mouth and sore throat with fever are separate health issues and should be treated separately. For the acid reflux into the mouth, you are correctly giving antacids. However, if the antacids don't help in the situation, she might be suffering from gastroesophageal reflux disease due to damaged valve at the junction of esophagus and stomach and should be treated after consultation with an gastroenterologist. For the sore throat and fever, it seems that she is suffering from bacterial infection in the tonsils causing tonsillitis and should be treated with antibiotics. She should be given Azithromycin 200 mg (Azee 200) twice a day for 3 days. For fever, she can be given Combiflam syrup 5 ml 3 times in a day. Oral Decongestants and warm salt water gargles will help too.If the situation is not improved or if gets worse, a physician or ENT specialist should be consulted. I hope this information helps you.

Adenoids are lymphoid tissues that are present in the fetus but they shrink and disappear as the child is born and ages. However, in some cases as in your child's, the adenoids fail to shrink and disappear and they cause troubles as your son is suffering from such as sleep apnea, mouth breathing, malocclusion etc.The solution to these issues is the removal of adenoids and tonsils if tonsils are constantly swollen by surgical procedure. I advise you that you should visit an ENT specialist for clinical examination and investigations for your son and discuss the option of surgical procedure to remove adenoids.I hope this information helps you.

The pain you are experiencing may be due to increase in the acid secretion in your stomach and duodemum. In case you do not get relief with acid reducing drugs, then you should consult your doctor who may suggest you to get your serum amylase and serum lipase levels in the blood.
