By a similar process, we can find a_3=frac{5}{3}. Upon inspection, we might conjecture that a_n=frac{n+2}{3}.Now, let's prove this conjecture by mathematical induction:1. Base Case: For n=1, a_1=frac{1+2}{3}=1. This satisfies the base case.2. Inductive Step: Assume the conjecture holds for all nleq k (where k is a positive integer), so a_k = frac{k+2}{3}. Then, S_k = frac{k(1+frac{k+2}{3})}{2} = frac{k(k+5)}{6}.Using the assumption and the equation S_k + frac{a_ka_{k+1}}{2(a_k-a_{k+1})} + 1 = 0, we obtainfrac{k(k+5)}{6} + frac{frac{k+2}{3}a_{k+1}}{frac{k+2}{3}-a_{k+1}}+1=0.Solving this, we get a_{k+1}=frac{k+3}{3}. Therefore, the conjecture holds for n=k+1 as well.Thus, for all positive integers n, a_n=frac{n+2}{3} is true. Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence, we getS_n = frac{n(n+5)}{6}.Hence,frac{3}{34}S_{12} = frac{3}{34} times frac{12 times (12+5)}{6} = 3.Thus, the value of frac{3}{34}S_{12} is boxed{3}."},{"problem":"2.

The faster ant is ahead of the slower one and is moving away from it.It is clear that situation 1 can over time turn into situation 2, and situation 3 can turn into situation 4. But if the ants at some point find themselves in situation 2 or 4, then from that moment on, they will always be moving away from each other.We know the distance between the ants at three moments in time. Note that between the first and second moment, 2 minutes have passed, and the distance between the ants has decreased by 4 meters. Between the second and third moment, 4 minutes have passed, and the distance has decreased by 2 meters. Since the distance decreased both times, we can be sure that 3 minutes and 5 minutes after the start of the observation, the ants were not in a \\"moving away\\" state, meaning they could only be in states 1 or 3.If the meeting between them had not occurred in the next 4 minutes (from the 5th to the 9th minute), they would have remained in the same state (1 or 3) and continued to approach each other at a rate of 4 meters in 2 minutes, meaning they should have closed the distance by 8 meters in 4 minutes. However, the distance between them decreased by only 2 meters, so at some point between the 2nd and 3rd moments, a meeting must have occurred.After the meeting, the ants move away from each other at the same speed they approached (in situations 1 and 2, the speeds of approaching and moving away are equal to the sum of the ants' speeds, while in situations 3 and 4, they are equal to the difference in their speeds). Therefore, in 4 minutes, the distance between the ants decreased from 5 meters to zero and then increased from zero to 3 meters. In total, 8 meters in 4 minutes, which matches the previously found rate of approaching. One minute earlier, the distance was 2 meters less. Therefore, 8 minutes after the start of the movement, the distance between the ants was 1 meter."},{"problem":"Which of the following expressions results in m^{2}?A: m^{6}div m^{3}B: m^{4}cdot m^{-2}C: left(m^{-1}right)^{2}D: m^{4}-m^{2}","solution":"To solve this problem, we apply the rules of exponents to each option:A: Using the rule for dividing powers with the same base, m^{6} div m^{3} simplifies to m^{6-3} = m^{3}.

A natural number x can be represented as the sum of the squares of two integers if and only if all prime numbers (except 2) that enter the factorization of the number x to an odd power have the form 4k+1 for some integers k. In particular, any prime number that gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 4 can be represented as the sum of two squares.

If each of the numbers a and b can be represented as the sum of two squares, then, as noted in the hint, their product can also be represented in such a form. Moreover, the product is typically representable as the sum of two squares in more ways than each of the factors. For example, the number 5 can be represented as the sum of two non-negative squares in only one way, up to the permutation of the summands, namely: 5=2^{2}+1^{2}; the number 13 also in only one way: 13=2^{2}+3^{2}, but their product already in two ways: 65=5 cdot 13=4^{2}+ 7^{2}=1^{2}+8^{2}.

This clearly has no solution for a geq 1, as the difference between two perfect squares is at least 3.ii) If a is even, we have a=2k for some positive integer k. Thus, a(a+2)=2k(2k+2)=(2k+1)^2-1. This is also not possible, as in this case we would have a perfect square between two consecutive perfect squares: (2k)^2 < a(a+2) < (2k+1)^2.Therefore, the product a(a+2) cannot be a perfect square. Moreover, ab and b(a+2) cannot both be perfect squares simultaneously, because in that case ab cdot b(a+2) = b^2 cdot a(a+2) would be a perfect square, implying that a(a+2) is also a perfect square, which contradicts the previous lemma.

The standard form of a parabola that opens to the right is y^2 = 4px, where p is the distance from the vertex to the focus. 1. From the equation y^{2}=8x, we identify 4p = 8, which means p = 2. However, for the purpose of finding the distance from the vertex to a point on the parabola, we consider the full distance from the vertex to the focus, which is p=4 in this context (considering the directrix on the other side).2. Let's denote the point M on the parabola as M(x_{0}, y_{0}). Given that the distance from M to the focus F is 4, and knowing the focus of this parabola is at (p, 0) = (4, 0), we set up the equation for the distance |MF| as follows:   [   |MF| = sqrt{(x_0 - 4)^2 + y_0^2} = 4   ]   However, from the given solution, we directly use the property that the x-coordinate of M is obtained by setting x_0 + frac{p}{2} = 4. This simplification arises from understanding that the distance |MF|=4 directly influences the x-coordinate of M based on the parabola's geometry and focus position.3. Substituting p=4 into the equation, we get x_0 + frac{4}{2} = 4, which simplifies to x_0 = 2.4. Knowing x_0 = 2 and substituting back into the parabola's equation y^2 = 8x, we find y_0^2 = 8(2) = 16. Thus, y_0 = pm 4.5. Therefore, the coordinates of point M are (2, pm 4). To find the distance from the origin O to M, we use the distance formula:   [   |OM| = sqrt{(2 - 0)^2 + (pm 4 - 0)^2} = sqrt{4 + 16} = sqrt{20} = 2sqrt{5}   ]Thus, the distance from the origin O to the point M on the parabola is 2sqrt{5}.

Substituting these values, we get:   [   Delta = sqrt{left( frac{3 + sqrt{5} + 2sqrt{2}}{4} right) left( frac{3 + sqrt{5} + 2sqrt{2}}{4} - frac{3}{2} right) left( frac{3 + sqrt{5} + 2sqrt{2}}{4} - frac{sqrt{5}}{2} right) left( frac{3 + sqrt{5} + 2sqrt{2}}{4} - sqrt{2} right)}   ]   Simplifying the terms inside the square root, we find:   [   Delta = frac{1}{4}   ]3. Determine the height of the triangle relative to the base ( AB ):   The height ( h ) from vertex ( C ) to the base ( AB ) can be calculated using the area formula:   [   Delta = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} implies frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{2} times frac{3}{2} times h implies h = 1   ]4. Analyze the folding process:   When the triangle is folded along a line perpendicular to ( AB ), the coincident area ( S ) changes. Initially, when the folding line passes through vertex ( C ), the coincident area ( S_0 ) is:   [   S_0 = frac{1}{4}   ]5. Displace the folding line by ( x ) towards vertex ( B ):   As the folding line is displaced by ( x ), the coincident area ( S ) is affected by the areas of the trapezoid and the right triangle formed. The coincident area ( S ) can be expressed as:   [   S = frac{1}{4} + x - frac{x^2}{2} - 3x^2   ]6. Find the maximum value of ( S ):   To find the maximum value of ( S ), we take the derivative of ( S ) with respect to ( x ) and set it to zero:   [   frac{dS}{dx} = 1 - x - 6x = 1 - 7x = 0 implies x = frac{1}{7}   ]   Substituting ( x = frac{1}{7} ) back into the expression for ( S ):   [   S = frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{7} - frac{left( frac{1}{7} right)^2}{2} - 3 left( frac{1}{7} right)^2 = frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{7} - frac{1}{98} - frac{3}{49}   ]   Simplifying the terms, we get:   [   S = frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{7} - frac{1}{98} - frac{6}{98} = frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{7} - frac{7}{98} = frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{7} - frac{1}{14} = frac{9}{28}   ]The final answer is (boxed{frac{9}{28}})"},{"problem":"Example 6 Let f(x) be a function defined on mathbf{R}.

Since ( n-1 ), ( n ), and ( n+1 ) are three consecutive integers, at least one of them must be divisible by 2, and at least one of them must be divisible by 3. This ensures that the product ( n(n-1)(n+1) ) is divisible by ( 2 times 3 = 6 ).3. Next, we need to check for divisibility by 4. There are two cases to consider:   - If ( n ) is even, then ( n ) itself is divisible by 2, and either ( n-1 ) or ( n+1 ) is also even, making the product divisible by ( 2 times 2 = 4 ).   - If ( n ) is odd, then both ( n-1 ) and ( n+1 ) are even, and one of them is divisible by 4.

Clearly he cannot run out of space with the rationals, because there is always a rational between any two given rationals. Similarly, he should not run out of space with all the integers. He just copies A in the other row, so that the tokens numbered k are always placed on the same number in each row. Note that B will lose if he does not space his tokens widely enough. Call the rows R and S, so that Sn denotes the number n in row S. Suppose A plays 1 on R5, then 2 on R6. If B plays 1 on S5 and 2 on S7, then he loses, because A swaps rows and plays 3 on S6. However, B does not need to make this mistake, so A can only force a win by always playing in the longer row, until B runs out of space to match him in the shorter row.

In the solution, we referred to the fact that if a positive integer m is not a perfect square, then sqrt{m} is irrational. This can be shown by a similar line of reasoning to the well-known proof of the irrationality of sqrt{2}. If sqrt{m} is rational, then it can be written as the ratio of relatively prime integers p / q. Squaring and multiplying by q^{2}, we get p^{2}=m cdot q^{2}. From this, on the one hand, m mid p^{2}, and on the other hand, since by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic p^{2} and q^{2} have no common divisor greater than 1, all prime factors of p^{2} are in the factorization of m, so p^{2} mid m. Combining the two divisibilities, we indeed get m=p^{2}, i.e., m is a perfect square.The above proof is not limited to square roots; it is generally true that the n-th root of a natural number is either an integer (and thus the number is the n-th power of that integer) or irrational."},{"problem":"5.

The answer is (E). Let m, n be the degrees of p(x) and q(x), respectively. They are positive integers. The relation between the polynomials given in the problem implies the following equation on the degrees, m n = 3 m + 5 n, which in turn is equivalent to (m-5)(n-3)=15.

Let ( n=2^{m} p ), where ( p ) is an odd number. We show that there exists ( l < 2 n-1 ) such that ( 2^{m+1} mid l ) and ( p mid (l+1) ) (in this case, of course, ( 2^{m} p leftlvert, frac{l(l+1)}{2}right. ), thus ( f(n) < 2 n-1 )).Since ( left(2^{m+1}, pright)=1 ), by the Chinese Remainder Theorem,[l equiv 0left(bmod 2^{m+1}right), quad l equiv p-1(bmod p),]has a solution ( l equiv x_{0}left(bmod 2^{m+1} pright) ). Therefore, there exists ( l_{0}, 0 < l_{0} leqslant 2^{m+1} p ) satisfying the above system of congruences. Note that ( 2 n-1 neq 0left(bmod 2^{m+1}right) ), and ( 2 n+1 not equiv 0(bmod p) ), so ( 2 n-1 ) and ( 2 n ) are not solutions to this system of congruences, hence ( 0 < l_{0} < 2 n-1 ), i.e., ( f(n) < 2 n-1 ).In summary, ( f(n) = 2 n-1 ) if and only if ( n ) is a power of 2."},{"problem":"Example 6.

We will stack the pencils in a box in descending order of length. The order of placement will be recorded in the form of a broken path from the point (0,0) in a rectangular Cartesian coordinate system on a plane to the point (6,6). The path will be constructed according to the following rules. If a pencil is placed in the lower row, we draw the next segment of the broken line of length 1 parallel to the Ox axis; if a pencil is placed in the second row, we draw a segment of length 1 parallel to the Oy axis. As a result, a broken path is formed consisting of 12 segments, each of which has a unit length and is parallel to one of the coordinate axes, and there are exactly 6 segments parallel to each axis. In addition, for each node with coordinates (x, y), the inequality mathrm{x} geq mathrm{y} holds. Such a path is also called correct, and the nodes through which a correct path can pass are called admissible. Each correct layout is uniquely associated with a correct path. The reverse is also true: each correct path is uniquely associated with a correct layout of pencils. Therefore, it is necessary to find the number of correct broken paths from the origin to the point (6,6).

In a 28 times 35 table, some k cells are painted red, another r- in pink, and the remaining s- in blue.

From the condition, it is easy to understand that each cell can have no more than one neighbor of a different color.We will prove that the coloring of the table must be \\"striped,\\" meaning that either each row or each column is completely colored in one color. To do this, it is sufficient to show that either all pairs of adjacent cells of different colors are horizontal neighbors, or all such pairs are vertical neighbors.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_28b5ece3789ad9441c8ag-6.jpg?height=313&width=259&top_left_y=401&top_left_x=597)Fig. 17: Solution to problem 11.8Consider any pair of adjacent cells of different colors - if there are cells of different colors in the table, such a pair will exist. The other neighbors of these cells match their colors, so the boundary separating the colors will continue in both directions (Fig. 17), and further, until it reaches the edges of the table.This means that any boundary between different colors must run from edge to edge of the table, and on each side of it will be a strip of cells of the same color. But this means that vertical and horizontal boundaries cannot coexist simultaneously. Therefore, either all boundaries are horizontal, or all boundaries are vertical, and the coloring is \\"striped\\" in any case. (The width of each strip should be at least 2 cells - however, this does not matter for the solution.)This means that either the number of cells of each color is divisible by the height of the table, or by its width, as is the difference k-s. On the other hand, this difference cannot be equal to 0, because in this case k=r=s and the total number of cells is 3k, but the number 28 cdot 35 is not divisible by 3. Therefore, k-s geqslant 28 or k-s geqslant 35.The equality k-s=28 is possible if the red cells occupy 12 columns (28 cells each), the pink cells occupy the same number, and the blue cells occupy 11 columns.

Applying this to our expression: x(x^2 - y^2) = x(x + y)(x - y). Therefore, the factorized form of the given expression is: boxed{x(x + y)(x - y)}. By extracting the common factor x and then applying the difference of squares formula, we have successfully factorized the expression. This problem tests our ability to identify common factors and to apply the difference of squares factorization technique efficiently.

Since 7 x notin mathrm{P}, we get the required contradiction.Then, of course, 7^{3} x in mathrm{Q}, and by repeating the previous argument, we will show that 7^{4} x in mathrm{P}, and subsequently 7^{5} x in mathrm{Q}.

A natural number s is called n-decomposable if the sum s can be paid using coins of denominations 3^{n}, 3^{n-1} cdot 4, ldots, 4^{n} piastres, and n-indecomposable otherwise. For n=1, only coins of 3 and 4 piastres are available. If s geqslant 8, then there exists an r in{0,1,2} such that (s-4 r) vdots 5. Then s has the form 4 r+3 k, meaning it is 1-decomposable. It is also clear that the numbers 7 and 6 are 1-decomposable, while 5 is not. Thus, the maximum 1-indecomposable number is 5=2 cdot 4^{2}-3^{3}.We will prove that for any natural n, the number 2 cdot 4^{n+1}-3^{n+2} is n-indecomposable. We will do this by induction.

Using the expressions for ( f ) and ( g ), we have:   [   g(x + f(y)) = gleft(x + (2y - 2g(0))right).   ]   Substituting ( g ) into this, we get:   [   g(x + 2y - 2g(0)) = frac{x + 2y - 2g(0)}{2} + g(0).   ]   Simplifying, we obtain:   [   g(x + f(y)) = frac{x}{2} + y - g(0) + g(0) = frac{x}{2} + y.   ]The final answer is (boxed{frac{x}{2} + y})."},{"problem":"4.

The new numbering is as follows:   [   1, 6, 11, 3, 8, 13, 5, 10, 2, 7, 12, 4, 9   ]   This re-numbering is done in a counterclockwise direction.2.

A natural number n is called interesting if 2 n is a perfect square, and 15 n is a perfect cube. Find the smallest interesting number.","solution":"Answer: 1800.Solution. Factorize the number n into prime factors. For a number to be a square, it is necessary that all prime numbers in this factorization appear in even powers, and for a number to be a cube, it is necessary that all prime numbers appear in powers divisible by 3.Let's look at the power of two that divides n. First, this power is odd, since 2 n is a perfect square. Second, this power is divisible by 3, since 15 n is a perfect cube. Therefore, the minimum power of two is 3.Now let's look at the power of three that divides n. First, this power is even, since 2 n is a perfect square. Second, this power gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, since 15 n is a perfect cube. Therefore, the minimum power of three is 2.Similarly, for five, we get that its minimum power is 2.Therefore, n is divisible by 2^{3} 3^{2} 5^{2}=1800, i.e., n geqslant 1800.

This is because the product of (7) and any integer (in this case, (x + y + 3)) will always result in a multiple of (7).Part 3: Relationship Between (x) and (y)If a rectangle with an area of (S_{1}) can be combined seamlessly with the original rectangle without any gaps or overlaps to form a new rectangle, this implies a specific relationship between the dimensions of these rectangles. Given the conditions, the width of the new rectangle is equal to the length of the original rectangle, which directly leads to the relationship:[x = y + 5]This relationship indicates how the dimensions of the original rectangle are related to each other for the seamless combination of the two rectangles to be possible."},{"problem":"Given that in triangle triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively.

If the fourth digit is 2, the continuation is: 2-3-8 - there is no further continuation. Therefore, the fourth digit is 5, and the continuation is: 5-7-6-9-5-7-6 and so on. Then we get an almost periodic sequence: 4-6-9-5-7-6-9-5-7-ldots, with a period of 4. Then the digit at the 2022nd position will be 6, since 2022=1+4 cdot 505+1. It was shown above that the digit 2 cannot appear in the initial positions of the guessed number. However, it can be the first, second, or third from the end. Therefore, it is possible that in the previous sequence, after the last digit 9, there are 2-3-8.

Analyzing the constraints for ( k = 3 ):   - Each player plays between 2 and 3 games against each of the other 23 players.   - Therefore, the total number of games played by each player ranges from ( 2 times 23 = 46 ) to ( 3 times 23 = 69 ).   - Since there are 24 players, each must have played a different number of games. This means we need 24 distinct integers in the range from 46 to 69.   - However, the range from 46 to 69 contains only 24 numbers: ( 46, 47, ldots, 69 ).   - If one player plays 46 games (2 games against each of the other 23 players), and another plays 69 games (3 games against each of the other 23 players), it is impossible for both conditions to be satisfied simultaneously. This is because the player with 69 games would have played 3 games against the player with 46 games, which contradicts the latter's total of 46 games.   - Hence, ( k = 3 ) is not possible.2. Proving ( k = 4 ) is possible by induction:   - Base Case (( n = 3 )):     - Consider three players who play 2, 3, and 4 games against each other.     - The total number of games played by these players will be 5, 6, and 7 respectively.     - This satisfies the condition that each player plays a different number of games.   - Inductive Step:     - Assume that for ( n geq 3 ), there exists a tournament ( T_n ) with ( n ) players where each pair of players plays between 2 and 4 games, and each player plays a different number of games.     - Let the number of games played by the players be ( a_1 < a_2 < cdots < a_n ).     - Case (i): If no player has played exactly 2 games against every other player:       - This implies ( a_1 > 2n - 2 ).       - Introduce a new player who plays exactly 2 games against each of the ( n ) existing players.       - The new number of games played by this player is ( 2n ).       - The new sequence of games played will be ( 2n, a_1 + 2, a_2 + 2, ldots, a_n + 2 ).       - This sequence maintains the property that each player plays a different number of games.     - Case (ii): If no player has played exactly 4 games against every other player:       - This implies ( a_n < 4n - 4 ).       - Introduce a new player who plays exactly 4 games against each of the ( n ) existing players.       - The new number of games played by this player is ( 4n ).       - The new sequence of games played will be ( a_1 + 4, a_2 + 4, ldots, a_n + 4, 4n ).       - This sequence also maintains the property that each player plays a different number of games.   - By induction, we have shown that for every ( n geq 3 ), there exists a tournament ( T_n ) with ( n ) players where each pair of players plays between 2 and 4 games, and each player plays a different number of games.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ k = 4 } )."},{"problem":"35.

S and T are the midpoints of MN and PQ, respectively. Determine whether the line ST passes through a fixed point. If it does, find the coordinates of that fixed point. If it does not, explain the reason.","solution":"Step-by-Step Solution:(1) Given that the focus of the ellipse is on the y-axis, we can write the equation of the ellipse as frac{y^2}{a^2} + frac{x^2}{b^2} = 1. The focal length is given as 2, so we have:- Focal length 2c = 2 implies c = 1. This is our first equation.- We also know that for an ellipse, a^2 = b^2 + c^2. This gives us our second equation.Let's consider a point P(x_0, y_0) on the ellipse. The equation frac{y_0^2}{a^2} + frac{x_0^2}{b^2} = 1 holds. This can be rearranged to frac{y_0^2}{x_0^2 - b^2} = -frac{a^2}{b^2}. Given A(-b, 0) and B(b, 0), the product of the slopes k_{PA} cdot k_{PB} = frac{y_0}{x_0 + b} cdot frac{y_0}{x_0 - b} = frac{y_0^2}{x_0^2 - b^2} = -frac{a^2}{b^2}. With k_{PA} cdot k_{PB} = -frac{4}{3}, we find that:- -frac{a^2}{b^2} = -frac{4}{3} implies frac{a^2}{b^2} = frac{4}{3}. This is our third equation.Solving equations (1), (2), and (3) together, we obtain a^2 = 4 and b^2 = 3. Therefore, the equation of the ellipse is boxed{frac{y^2}{4} + frac{x^2}{3} = 1}.(2) From part (1), we know the upper focus of the ellipse E is at (0, 1). For the slope of line l_1, let's assume it exists and the equation of l_1 is y = kx + 1. Let M(x_1, y_1) and N(x_2, y_2). Solving the system left{begin{array}{l}y = kx + 1frac{y^2}{4} + frac{x^2}{3} = 1end{array}right., we derive (3k^2 + 4)x^2 + 6kx - 9 = 0. This leads to x_M + x_N = -frac{6k}{3k^2 + 4}. Therefore, x_S = frac{x_M + x_N}{2} = -frac{3k}{3k^2 + 4} and y_S = kx_S + 1 = frac{4}{3k^2 + 4}. Hence, S is located at left(-frac{3k}{3k^2 + 4}, frac{4}{3k^2 + 4}right). By replacing k with -frac{1}{k}, we find Tleft(frac{3k}{3 + 4k^2}, frac{4k^2}{3 + 4k^2}right). The equation of line ST simplifies to y = frac{4(k^2 - 1)}{7k}x + frac{4}{7}. Therefore, line ST always passes through the fixed point boxed{(0, frac{4}{7})}.When the slope of line l_1 does not exist, the equation of l_1 is x = 0 and that of l_2 is y = 1. This results in M(0, 2), N(0, -2), P(-frac{3}{2}, 1), and Q(frac{3}{2}, 1). The midpoints S and T are found to be S(0, 0) and T(0, 1), respectively. Thus, the equation of line ST is x = 0, which also passes through the point boxed{(0, frac{4}{7})}.

Although it has been shown that |y| geqslant 11, i.e., y leqslant-11 or y geqslant 11, it is not sufficiently justified to conclude that the minimum value of y is -11 (the original answer).In fact, since y^{2}=11left(x^{2}+10right) is a perfect square, it follows that x^{2}+10=11 k^{2}left(k in mathbf{N}_{+}right), at which point, y= pm 11 k. If the equation x^{2}+10=11 k^{2} has only a finite number of integer solutions, let the solution that makes k the largest be left(x_{0}, k_{0}right), then the minimum value of y is -11 k_{0}; if the equation x^{2}+10=11 k^{2} has an infinite number of integer solutions, then the minimum value of y does not exist. Clearly, discussing all integer solutions to the equation x^{2}+10=11 k^{2} goes beyond the scope of junior high school mathematics competition knowledge.Moreover, taking the equation x^{2}+10=11 k^{2} modulo 11, we get 111left(x^{2}+10right), thus, 111left(x^{2}-1right).Therefore, 11 divides (x-1) or 11 divides (x+1).When 11 divides (x-1), taking x=23 satisfies the condition, at which point, k=7, and the corresponding y= pm 77.When 11 divides (x+1), taking x=43 satisfies the condition, at which point, k=13, and the corresponding y= pm 143.It is evident that y_{text {min }}=-11 is clearly incorrect."},{"problem":"25.

For how many integers 1 leq n leq 2020 is f(n) relatively prime to all of f(0), f(1), dots, f(n-1)? ","solution":"1. Define the function and the problem:   We are given the function ( f(x) = 2^x + 3^x ). We need to determine for how many integers ( 1 leq n leq 2020 ) the value ( f(n) ) is relatively prime to all of ( f(0), f(1), dots, f(n-1) ).2. Identify the key property:   The key property to consider is the relative primality of ( f(n) ) with all previous values ( f(0), f(1), dots, f(n-1) ). We need to find ( n ) such that ( gcd(f(n), f(k)) = 1 ) for all ( k < n ).3. Consider powers of 2:   Let's consider ( n = 2^k ) for ( k geq 0 ). We need to check if ( f(2^k) ) is relatively prime to all ( f(2^j) ) for ( j < k ).4. Check the necessity:   If ( n = 2^e cdot k ) for some odd ( k ), then ( f(n) = 2^n + 3^n ). We need to show that ( f(k) mid f(n) ).5. Factorization and divisibility:   Suppose ( n = 2^e cdot k ) where ( k ) is odd. Then:   [   f(n) = 2^{2^e cdot k} + 3^{2^e cdot k}   ]   We need to show that ( f(k) mid f(n) ). If ( k ) is odd, then:   [   f(k) = 2^k + 3^k   ]   Since ( n = 2^e cdot k ), we have:   [   f(n) = 2^{2^e cdot k} + 3^{2^e cdot k}   ]   By properties of exponents, ( 2^{2^e cdot k} equiv (-3)^{2^e cdot k} pmod{p} ) for some prime ( p ) dividing ( f(k) ).6. Order of elements:   Suppose ( 2^{2^a} + 3^{2^a} ) and ( 2^{2^b} + 3^{2^b} ) share a common prime factor ( p ). Then:   [   2^{2^a} equiv -3^{2^a} pmod{p} implies 2^{2^{a+1}} equiv 3^{2^{a+1}} pmod{p}   ]   This implies that the order of ( frac{3}{2} ) modulo ( p ) is ( 2^{a+1} ). If ( p mid f(2^b) ), then the order of ( frac{3}{2} ) modulo ( p ) is ( 2^{b+1} ), which must be different from ( 2^{a+1} ), leading to a contradiction.7. Conclusion:   Therefore, ( f(2^k) ) is relatively prime to all ( f(2^j) ) for ( j < k ). The values of ( k ) range from ( 0 ) to ( lfloor log_2(2020) rfloor = 11 ).The final answer is (boxed{11})."},{"problem":"Given a geometric sequence {a_n}, where a_5=3 and a_4a_7=45, the value of frac{a_7-a_9}{a_5-a_7} is ( ).A: 3B: 5C: 9D: 25","solution":"According to the problem, in the geometric sequence {a_n}, we have a_5=3 and a_4a_7=45.Thus, we get a_6= frac{a_4a_7}{a_5}=15,and then q= frac{a_6}{a_5}=5,so frac{a_7-a_9}{a_5-a_7}= frac{a_5cdot q^2-a_7cdot q^2}{a_5-a_7}=q^2=25;Therefore, the correct choice is boxed{D}.According to the problem, by using the properties of a geometric sequence, we can derive a_6= frac{a_4a_7}{a_5}, and from this, we can calculate the value of a_6.

We can create several rules to follow for the elements in subset S. No element can be 1 (text{mod} 5) if there is an element that is 4 (text{mod} 5). No element can be 2 (text{mod} 5) if there is an element that is 3 (text{mod} 5). Thus we can pick 6 elements from either 1 (text{mod} 5) or 4 (text{mod} 5) and 6 elements from either 2 (text{mod} 5) or 3 (text{mod} 5) for a total of 6+6=12 elements. Considering 0 (text{mod} 5), there can be one element that is so because it will only be divisible by 5 if paired with another element that is 0 (text{mod} 5). The final answer is boxed{textbf{(B)} 13}.== Solution 2 == ( Similar to solution 1 but more detailed) Since we are taking the sum of distinct numbers mod(5), the only values that can be the remainder is 0,1,2,3,4. We dismiss the case of remainder 0 because this would make the sum a multiple of 5, which is not allowed. In addition, since we can't have 0 or 5 mod(5), we make some restraints. There are four different cases for the \\"allowed\\" mods in the sequence, or the remainders that the sum of distinct elements are allowed to be in the sequence. They are:1)      1mod(5), and 3mod(5)2)      1mod(5), and 2mod(5)3)      2mod(5), and 4mod(5), 4)      2mod(5), and 1mod(5) Now, we can calculate the number of elements in each of these cases. For the first case, we rewrite 1mod(5) in the form 5k+1. Because 5k+1 < 30, which is the largest element in the sequence possible, we obtain k=5. In addition, for 3mod(5), we have 3x+5<30, x=5. This gives us 5+5=10 solutions. The reason why we can add these elements is because all of these elements, no matter which two you add, can never be a multiple of 5. The only possible remainders for the sum are 1+1, 1+3, or 3+3. In a similar manner, we calculate the element using the same logic. We find that 2mod(5) has 5 elements, and 1mod(5) has 8 elements, meaning that there are a total of 13 elements, which is the answer. ~CharmaineMa07292010"},{"problem":"Use the Horner's Rule to calculate the value of a univariate polynomial f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ldots + a_1x + a_0 when x = x_0.

In the place of Srednje Zuze, every phone number has five digits arranged in non-increasing or non-decreasing order, and the first digit is not 0. How many phone numbers can exist in this place at most?## Third grade - B category","solution":"5. If all digits are the same, there are 9 such numbers (all except 00000, as it does not satisfy the conditions of the problem). Let's further consider numbers that have at least two different digits.First, let's count how many such numbers can have digits in non-decreasing order. Each such number is uniquely determined by the selection of five digits that make it up (once the digits are chosen, the number is obtained by sorting them in non-decreasing order), and among the digits, there must not be a 0 (if there were, it would have to go at the beginning of the phone number due to the non-decreasing order, which is prohibited by the problem's conditions). If the number is composed of only two different digits, they form one of the following patterns: first one digit, then four of the same (larger than the previous one); first two of the same, then three of the same (larger than the previous ones); first three of the same, then two more of the same; first four of the same, then one more larger. Thus, from two fixed digits, we can make 4 phone numbers, and since these 2 digits can be chosen in binom{9}{2} ways, there are 4 cdot binom{9}{2} such phone numbers. If the number is composed of three different digits, they form one of the following patterns: 3+1+1, 1+3+1, 1+1+3, 2+2+1, 2+1+2, or 1+2+2, which is 6 possibilities, and since these three digits can be chosen in binom{9}{3} ways, this gives 6 cdot binom{9}{3} numbers. If the number is composed of four different digits, they form one of the following patterns: 1+1+1+2, 1+1+2+1, 1+2+1+1, or 2+1+1+1, so there are 4 cdot binom{9}{4} such numbers. Finally, those with all different digits have binom{9}{5}.Now let's count the numbers whose digits are in non-increasing order. The reasoning is the same, only we need to keep in mind that now we have 10 digits to choose from (since here the numbers can contain the digit 0), so we get another 4 cdot binom{10}{2} + 6 cdot binom{10}{3} + 4 cdot binom{10}{4} + binom{10}{5} phone numbers.The total result is: 9 + 4 cdot binom{9}{2} + 6 cdot binom{9}{3} + 4 cdot binom{9}{4} + binom{9}{5} + 4 cdot binom{10}{2} + 6 cdot binom{10}{3} + 4 cdot binom{10}{4} + binom{10}{5} = 9 + 144 + 504 + 504 + 126 + 180 + 720 + 840 + 252 = 3279 phone numbers.## Third Grade - B Category"},{"problem":"Given a non-zero arithmetic sequence {a_n} that satisfies 2a_2 + 2a_{12} = a_7^2, and a geometric sequence {b_n} with b_7 = a_7, find the value of b_5b_9.A: 16  B: 8  C: 4  D: 2","solution":"Since 2a_2 + 2a_{12} = a_7^2, by the properties of an arithmetic sequence, we can deduce that a_2 + a_{12} = 2a_7.

Find the largest possible number of integers that can be selected from the set {1,2,3, ldots, 100} such that no two of them differ by 2 or 5.","solution":"SOLUTION. First, we will show that from any seven consecutive numbers, denoted asa, a+1, a+2, a+3, a+4, a+5, a+6,we can select at most three numbers in the required way. To do this, we divide all seven numbers into three setsA={a, a+2, a+5}, quad B={a+1, a+3}, quad C={a+4, a+6}.Since we can select at most two numbers from set A and at most one number from each of sets B and C, it suffices to exclude the case where two numbers are selected from set A (necessarily a+2 and a+5) and one number is selected from each of sets B and C. In this case, due to the number a+2, the number a+6 must be selected from C, and due to the number a+5, the number a+1 must be selected from B. The simultaneous selection of numbers a+1 and a+6 is, however, impossible.Using the proven property, we can now easily explain why from all 100 given numbers from 1 to 100, which we have at our disposal, it is not possible to select more than 44 numbers in the required way. For this, from all 100 numbers, we form 14 disjoint sets of seven consecutive numbers{1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, quad{8,9,10,11,12,13,14}, ldots, quad{92,93,94,95,96,97,98}excluding only the two largest numbers 99 and 100. As we have shown, from each of the listed sets of seven, we can select at most three numbers, so the total number of selected numbers indeed never exceeds the number 14 cdot 3 + 2 = 44.In the final part of the solution, we will show that selecting 44 numbers is possible and that it is unique (even though the problem statement does not require this). Suppose we have any valid selection of 44 numbers. According to the previous paragraph, we know that the selected numbers must include the pair 99 and 100. If we modify the composition of 14 disjoint sets of seven to{3,4,5,6,7,8,9}, {10,11,12,13,14,15,16}, ldots, quad{94,95,96,97,98,99,100}we conclude that the selected numbers must also include the numbers 1 and 2. It is clear that by using other compositions of 14 sets of seven, always consisting of some of the first sets from (1) and some of the last sets from (2), we can deduce that the selected numbers must also include the pairs 8 and 9, 15 and 16, ..., 92 and 93, a total of 15 pairs of consecutive numbers, which give remainders 1 and 2 when divided by seven.What can we further conclude about the remaining 44 - 30 = 14 selected numbers? Thanks to the proven property, we know that these must be numbers selected one from each of the 14 sets (1); since in each of these sets, the two smallest numbers are definitely selected, the third selected number in the set must be the one that is the fifth smallest in the set.We have shown that every valid selection of 44 numbers must look like this:{1,2,5} cup {8,9,12} cup {15,16,19} cup ldots cup {92,93,96} cup {99,100}That this selection, composed of 14 triples and one pair, is indeed valid, we can easily explain: two numbers from the same group differ by 1, 3, or 4; the difference between any two numbers in adjacent groups is one of the numbers 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, or 11; numbers from non-adjacent groups have differences of at least 10.GUIDING PROBLEMS:N1.

According to the problem statement, for any five members of the committee, there should be a lock for which the key is absent from all these committee members (but is present with each of the six absent members, since the presence of any of the nine absent members already makes the meeting of the committee possible).

A total of n individuals are to be selected from these people to attend a city-wide science and technology conference. If systematic sampling and stratified sampling methods are used to draw the participants without individual exclusion, but when using systematic sampling, if the number of participants increases by 1, 1 individual needs to be excluded from the total initially. Find the value of n.","solution":"Let's start by understanding the two sampling methods mentioned in the problem.Systematic Sampling:Systematic sampling is a procedure in which every k^{th} subject is selected from a list or sequence. If the number of individuals to be selected increases by 1, and we need to remove an individual before we even start the process, this suggests that each \\"section\\" or \\"stratum\\" of the sample is currently perfectly divided by n, and adding one more individual would require removing an individual to keep the same sampling rate. Hence n has to divide the total number of individuals.Stratified Sampling:Stratified sampling involves dividing a population into smaller groups, known as strata. In a stratified sample, the strata are formed based on members' shared attributes or characteristics. Since we're considering a stratified sample without any removal and with the need for systematic sampling to remove one individual when one more participant is added, the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of individuals in each stratum (6 engineers, 12 technicians, 18 workers) will be helpful. We need to find the number of individuals n where the number plus one (n+1) will force us to remove one individual for systematic sampling.Let's find the LCM of the strata population sizes:[begin{aligned}text{LCM}(6, 12, 18) &= text{LCM}(2 times 3, 2^2 times 3, 2 times 3^2) &= 2^2 times 3^2 &= 4 times 9 &= 36.end{aligned}]Thus, sampling using the LCM would allow us to perfectly divide the groups without exclusion.When using systematic sampling, if adding one more participant means we need to remove someone before sampling, it means that previously n divided the total population cleanly with no remainder. To find such an n, consider the LCM we just computed. If we let n = 36, adding 1 to it makes n + 1 = 37, which does not divide the total population without remainder, implying someone would need to be excluded. However, we are looking for the largest sample size smaller than 36 that would still not require any individual exclusion.The next smaller size that would divide the total population size is achieved by dividing 36 by a factor which will still divide the total population. The total population is 6 + 12 + 18 = 36 individuals. The factors of 36 other than 36 itself are: 18, 12, 9, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1.Out of these, we consider the greatest factor which is strictly less than the LCM of the individual group sizes before addition. This is 18, however, adding one to it gives 19, which would still not result in exclusion as 19 is prime. So, we consider the next smaller size which is 12. Adding one to 12 makes 13, and 13 also does not divide 36 without remainder.Continuing this process, we find that when n = 6, adding one gives us n + 1 = 7, and 7 would not cleanly divide the total population of 36. Therefore, if we increase the number of participants by 1 from 6 to 7, we would need to exclude an individual before sampling to maintain the systematic sampling method.Hence, n must equal 6.[boxed{n = 6}]"},{"problem":"60°= ______ ．(Convert to radians)","solution":"Solution: Since 1°= frac{pi}{180} radians, then 60°=60 times frac{pi}{180} = frac{pi}{3}.

Each digit appears in each decimal place (units, tens, hundreds, etc.) with a certain frequency.4.

Harmonic Sum:   The sum of the reciprocals of the digits from 1 to 9 is:   [   sum_{d=1}^{9} frac{1}{d} = 1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{7} + frac{1}{8} + frac{1}{9}   ]7. Finding the Least ( k ):   To make ( k! cdot S_{2016} ) an integer, ( k! ) must clear the denominators of the harmonic sum. The denominators are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

We will use the given rules:1. If ( a ) is removed, then ( 2a ) must also be removed.2. If ( a ) and ( b ) are removed, then ( a + b ) must also be removed.Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:1. Removing the smallest number:   - If we remove 1, then we must also remove 2 (since ( 2 times 1 = 2 )), 3 (since ( 1 + 2 = 3 )), and so on. This will lead to removing all numbers in the set ( A ). Therefore, removing 1 is not optimal.2. Removing even numbers:   - Consider removing the even numbers ( 2, 4, 6, ldots, 2(n-1) ). This removes ( n-1 ) numbers. According to the rules, removing these numbers does not force us to remove any additional numbers because:     - ( 2a ) for any ( a ) in the set of even numbers is already included in the set of even numbers.     - The sum of any two even numbers is also an even number, which is already included in the set of even numbers.3. Sum of remaining numbers:   - The sum of the set ( A ) is:     [     sum_{k=1}^{2n-1} k = frac{(2n-1) cdot 2n}{2} = n(2n-1)     ]   - The sum of the removed even numbers is:     [     sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 2k = 2 sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k = 2 cdot frac{(n-1)n}{2} = n(n-1)     ]   - Therefore, the sum of the remaining numbers is:     [     n(2n-1) - n(n-1) = n(2n-1) - n^2 + n = n^2     ]4. Verification of optimality:   - By Lemma 1, removing 1 leads to removing all numbers, which is not optimal.   - By Lemma 2, removing the even numbers ( 2, 4, ldots, 2(n-1) ) leaves us with a sum of ( n^2 ).   - By Lemma 3, any other combination of removed numbers will result in a sum of the remaining numbers that is less than ( n^2 ).Thus, the optimal way to remove numbers is to remove the even numbers ( 2, 4, 6, ldots, 2(n-1) ), which leaves the sum of the remaining numbers as ( n^2 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ n^2 } )"},{"problem":"Four.

The divisibility relation then becomes, after simplification, ell(ell+2 m) mid 3 m^{2}. Since operatorname{gcd}(ell+2 m, m)=operatorname{gcd}(ell+2 m-2 m, m)=operatorname{gcd}(ell, m)=1, that is, ell+2 m is coprime with m, and thus with m^{2}. Since ell+2 m mid 3 m^{2}, by Gauss's lemma, ell+2 m mid 3, that is, ell+2 m in{1,3}. But ell, m geqslant 1 so ell+2 m geqslant 3. In other words, ell+2 m=3 and thus necessarily, ell=m=1.

If no other point were left out, the remaining points would form three equilateral triangles with no common vertices (A D I, E B F and H J G). Therefore, at least one vertex of each of these triangles must be left out to obtain a set of points that meets the conditions. Thus, at least 1+3=4 points must be left out, meaning that at most 10-4=6 points can be retained.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_773e2fe68f2c5cbcc39cg-1.jpg?height=399&width=352&top_left_y=966&top_left_x=884)We will show that this is indeed possible. Let's leave out the points C, D, E, and J. Then, among the remaining six points, three are collinear in pairs (Figure 2). If any three of them formed an equilateral triangle, we could assume, due to the symmetric role of the points, that two of its vertices belong to the set {A, I, H}. However, if one side of an equilateral triangle is A I, A H, or I H, then its third vertex could only be D, E, or J respectively, but we have left out all these points.Therefore, at most six points can be retained from the ten such that no three of them form an equilateral triangle.Remark. It can be shown that if six points are retained, then no three of them can form an equilateral triangle only if the points are arranged as shown in Figure 2, i.e., three of them are on each side of the original equilateral triangle and differ from the intersection point of these two sides."},{"problem":"A cross-section of a river is a trapezoid with bases 10 and 16 and slanted sides of length 5 .

For what minimum value of n will the set of weights necessarily contain two pairs of weights with equal sums?---The translation preserves the original text's formatting and line breaks.","solution":"[Solution] When the weights of the 7 weights are 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 grams respectively, it is easy to verify that the sums of the weights of any two pairs are all different. In fact, among the 4 weights of two pairs, the sum of the weights of the pair containing the heaviest weight is heavier. From this, we know that the minimum value sought is no less than 8.Next, we will prove that in any 8 weights, we can always find two pairs of weights such that their sums are equal.Since 8 weights can form C_{8}^{2}=28 different pairs of weights (two \\"pairs\\" are different if at least one weight in one pair does not belong to the other), and the absolute value of the difference in weight (simply called the difference) of each pair of weights does not exceed 20 grams and is a positive integer, there are at most 20 different difference values. Therefore, we can select 8 different pairs of weights:left{left(a_{i}, b_{i}right),left(c_{i}, d_{i}right)right}, i=1,2, cdots, 8 text {, }such thatb_{i}-a_{i}=d_{i}-c_{i}, i=1,2, cdots, 8 .(1) If among the 8 pairs of weights in (1), there is a group of 4 weights a, b, c, d that are all different, then by (2) we get a+d=b+c, and the two pairs of weights (a, d),(b, c) meet the requirements.(2) Suppose that in the 8 pairs of weights in (1), the 4 weights in each group are not all different. At this point, if there are two weights among the 8 weights that are the same, then there are obviously two pairs of weights with equal sums. Below, assume that the weights of the 8 weights are all different. Then by (2) we know b_{i}=c_{i}, i=1,2, cdots, 8. In this way, each pair of weights in (1) is transformed into a tripletleft{a_{i}, b_{i}, d_{i}right}, i=1,2, cdots, 8,satisfying the conditiona_{i}+d_{i}=2 b_{i}, i=1,2, cdots, 8,that is, b_{i} is the arithmetic mean of a_{i} and d_{i}, so it cannot be the lightest or heaviest weight, but can only be one of the 6 middle weights. By the pigeonhole principle, b_{1}, b_{2}, cdots, b_{8} must have two that are the same, say b_{i}=b_{j}(i neq j). Then by (4) we have a_{i}+d_{i}=a_{j}+d_{j}. It is easy to see that a_{i}, d_{i}, a_{j}, d_{j} are all different.

The discriminant of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is given by Delta = b^2 - 4ac. For our equation, a = 1, b = 2(m-1), and c = m^2 - 1. Therefore,[Delta = [2(m-1)]^2 - 4(1)(m^2 - 1) = 4(m-1)^2 - 4(m^2 - 1) = 4m^2 - 8m + 4 - 4m^2 + 4 = -8m + 8.]For the equation to have two distinct real roots, we require Delta > 0:[-8m + 8 > 0 implies 8 > 8m implies 1 > m.]Thus, the range of m for which the equation has two distinct real roots is m < 1.

For m = 1, the equation becomes x^2 = 0, which has a double root, not distinct. Therefore, we discard m = 1. For m = -1, the condition for distinct roots is not violated.

Such permutations are known as 312-avoiding permutations.2. Characterizing 312-Avoiding Permutations:   A permutation is 312-avoiding if it does not contain any subsequence of three elements where the first element is the largest, the second element is the smallest, and the third element is in between. These permutations are also known as stack-sortable permutations.3. Catalan Numbers:   The number of 312-avoiding permutations of (n) elements is given by the (n)-th Catalan number. The (n)-th Catalan number (C_n) is given by:   [   C_n = frac{1}{n+1} binom{2n}{n}   ]   This formula arises from the recursive nature of 312-avoiding permutations.4. Recursive Definition:   Let (g(n)) denote the number of 312-avoiding permutations of (1, 2, ldots, n). The recursive formula for (g(n)) is:   [   g(n) = sum_{j=0}^{n-1} g(j) g(n-1-j)   ]   This recurrence relation is characteristic of Catalan numbers.5. Calculating (g(10)):   Using the formula for Catalan numbers, we calculate (C_{10}):   [   C_{10} = frac{1}{10+1} binom{20}{10} = frac{1}{11} binom{20}{10}   ]   First, compute (binom{20}{10}):   [   binom{20}{10} = frac{20!}{10! cdot 10!}   ]   Using factorial values:   [   20! = 2,432,902,008,176,640,000   ]   [   10! = 3,628,800   ]   Therefore:   [   binom{20}{10} = frac{2,432,902,008,176,640,000}{(3,628,800)^2} = 184,756   ]   Now, compute (C_{10}):   [   C_{10} = frac{1}{11} times 184,756 = 16,796   ]The final answer is (boxed{16,796})."},{"problem":"Given the function f(x)=lg dfrac {1+ax}{1-2x}(a > 0) is an odd function, determine the monotonically decreasing interval of the function g(x)=log _{ frac {1}{a}}(x^{2}-6x+5).","solution":"Since f(x) is an odd function, we have f(-x)=-f(x).

Case (a = 0):   If (a = 0), then (a_1 = 0) and (a_n = 0) for all (n). Clearly, (|a_n| = 0 < 1) for all (n). Thus, (a = 0) is a valid solution.3. General Case (a ne 0):   Define the function (f(x) = x - frac{1}{x}). We need to analyze the behavior of the sequence generated by this function.4. Behavior of (f(x)):   Notice that:   [   f(-x) = -x - frac{1}{-x} = -left(x - frac{1}{x}right) = -f(x)   ]   and   [   fleft(frac{1}{x}right) = frac{1}{x} - x   ]   This symmetry suggests that we only need to consider (a in (-1, 1)).5.

The expected value of the number of days that Kevin eats a cookie before all cookies are gone can be expressed in the form frac{m}{n}, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Find m + n.[i]Proposed by Ray Li[/i]","solution":"1. Define the Problem and Variables:   Kevin has (255) cookies, each labeled with a unique nonempty subset of ({1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}). Each day, he chooses one cookie uniformly at random from the remaining cookies, eats it, and also eats all cookies labeled with subsets of the chosen cookie. We need to find the expected number of days until all cookies are eaten.2. Indicator Variables:   Let (c_S) be an indicator variable that takes the value (1) if the cookie labeled with subset (S) is chosen manually by Kevin, and (0) otherwise. We seek the expected value (mathbb{E}left[sum_{S} c_Sright] = sum_{S} mathbb{E}[c_S]).3. Expected Value of (c_S):   The expected value (mathbb{E}[c_S]) is the probability that the cookie labeled with (S) is chosen manually. This happens if and only if Kevin chooses a cookie labeled with a superset of (S) before any other cookie labeled with a proper subset of (S).4. Probability Calculation:   The probability that a specific cookie (S) is chosen manually is the probability that (S) itself is the chosen superset.

In the last intersected vertex D, we obtain the maximum value of z. Vertex D is the intersection point of lines l_{2} and l_{3}.To find the coordinates of point D, we solve the system:begin{array}{rlrl}32 x_{1}+32 x_{2} & =480, quad x_{1}+x_{2}=15, 58 x_{1}+29 x_{2} & =696, quad 2 x_{1}+x_{2} & =24 .end{array}Solving the system, we find that x_{1}=9, x_{2}=6, i.e., D(9 ; 6) and at this point z=4 cdot 9+3 cdot 6=54 (conditional units).To solve the problem using the simplex method, we convert the system of constraints (7.1) to the form of equalities by introducing non-negative slack variables y_{i}(i=1,2,3,4):begin{gathered}13 x_{1}+24 x_{2}+y_{1}=312 x_{1}+x_{2}+y_{2}=15 2 x_{1}+x_{2}+y_{3}=24 -x_{1}-x_{2}+y_{4}=-10 -4 x_{1}-3 x_{2}+Z=0end{gathered}with x_{j} geq 0(j=1,2) ; y_{i} geq 0(i=1,2,3,4).We write the system using abbreviated tables (Table 7.1).Table 7.1|  | x_{1} | x_{2} | 1 || :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || y_{1} | 13 | 24 | =312 || y_{2} | 1 | 1 | =15 || y_{3} | 2 | 1 | =24 || y_{4} | -1 | -1 | =-10 || Z | -4 | -3 | =0 |Since there is a negative element in the I-column, we need to make it positive.

Hence, x^2 leq 21.Note that x, y are positive integers, so x = 1, 2, 3, 4.Substituting into equation (2), after inspection, only when x = 3, y^2 + 3y = 54 Rightarrow y = 6 or -9 (discard).Thus, (x, y) = (3, 6), (6, 3)Rightarrow (a, b) = (12, 24), (24, 12)."},{"problem":"(frac{1}{3})^{100}×{3}^{101}=______.","solution":"To solve the expression (frac{1}{3})^{100}×{3}^{101}, we follow these steps:1.

(A straight line is considered a circle of infinite radius.)2. Symmetry Property. Two points z_{1} and z_{2}, symmetric with respect to a circle C, are mapped to points w_{1} and w_{2}, symmetric with respect to a circle Gamma, to which the circle C is mapped.Corollary. If under a fractional linear mapping w=f(z) a straight line or circle gamma is mapped to a circle Gamma and one of two points symmetric with respect to gamma is mapped to the center of the circle Gamma, then the other point necessarily maps to the infinitely distant point.3. There exists a unique fractional linear function that maps three given points z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3} in the z-plane to three given points w_{1}, w_{2}, w_{3} in the w-plane.

Start with the given expression:   [   frac{2x}{3} - frac{x}{6}   ]2. Find a common denominator to combine the fractions. The least common multiple of 3 and 6 is 6:   [   frac{2x}{3} = frac{2x cdot 2}{3 cdot 2} = frac{4x}{6}   ]   So the expression becomes:   [   frac{4x}{6} - frac{x}{6}   ]3.

For a positive integer m, we partition the set {1, 2, 3,...,m} into n subsets, so that the product of two different elements in the same subset is never a perfect square. In terms of n, fi\\fnd the largest positive integer m for which such a partition exists.","solution":"1. Understanding the problem: We need to partition the set {1, 2, 3, ldots, m} into n subsets such that the product of any two different elements in the same subset is never a perfect square. We aim to find the largest possible m in terms of n.2. Upper bound for m: If m geq (n+1)^2, then there would be at least n+1 perfect squares in the set {1, 2, 3, ldots, m}. Since we have only n subsets, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one subset would contain at least two perfect squares. The product of two perfect squares is a perfect square, which violates the condition. Therefore, m < (n+1)^2.3. Constructing the subsets: We construct the subsets A_k = {k^2, k^2 + 1, ldots, k^2 + 2k} for k = 1, 2, ldots, n. This construction ensures that each subset A_k contains 2k + 1 elements, and the union of all A_k covers the set {1, 2, ldots, m} where m = n^2 + 2n.4. Verifying the construction: We need to show that the product of any two different elements in the same subset A_k is not a perfect square. Consider two different elements k^2 + a and k^2 + b in A_k where 0 leq a < b leq 2k.5. Checking the product: We calculate the product:   [   (k^2 + a)(k^2 + b) = k^4 + (a + b)k^2 + ab   ]   We need to show that this expression is not a perfect square. Suppose it is a perfect square, say (k^2 + a)(k^2 + b) = (k^2 + c)^2 for some integer c. Then:   [   k^4 + (a + b)k^2 + ab = k^4 + 2ck^2 + c^2   ]   Equating the coefficients, we get:   [   a + b = 2c quad text{and} quad ab = c^2   ]   Solving these equations, we find that a and b must be roots of the quadratic equation x^2 - 2cx + c^2 = 0, which implies a = b, contradicting the assumption that a neq b. Therefore, (k^2 + a)(k^2 + b) cannot be a perfect square.6. Conclusion: The construction of subsets A_k ensures that the product of any two different elements in the same subset is not a perfect square.

We will use the fact that (a^2 + b^2 = 4).3. First, we express (a) and (b) in terms of their sum and product. Let (s = a + b) and (p = ab).

Identify the Center of the Circle and Calculate Distance to the Given Line   The center of the circle is at ((3,-5)). The distance (d) from a point ((x_0,y_0)) to a line (Ax+By+C=0) is given by (d = frac{|Ax_0+By_0+C|}{sqrt{A^2+B^2}}). Thus, the distance from the center to the line (4x-3y-2=0) is:   [   d = frac{|4cdot3-3cdot(-5)-2|}{sqrt{4^2+(-3)^2}} = frac{|12+15-2|}{sqrt{16+9}} = frac{25}{sqrt{25}} = 5.   ]2. Calculate Distances to the Parallel Lines   The lines parallel to (4x-3y-2=0) and at a distance of (1) on either side are (4x-3y-7=0) and (4x-3y+3=0). The distances from the center to these lines are calculated similarly:   - For (4x-3y-7=0):     [     frac{|4cdot3-3cdot(-5)-7|}{sqrt{4^2+(-3)^2}} = frac{|12+15-7|}{sqrt{25}} = frac{20}{5} = 4.     ]      - For (4x-3y+3=0):     [     frac{|4cdot3-3cdot(-5)+3|}{sqrt{4^2+(-3)^2}} = frac{|12+15+3|}{sqrt{25}} = frac{30}{5} = 6.     ]   3. Analyze Intersection Points   Since the circle intersects the lines at exactly two points at a distance of (1) from (4x-3y-2=0), it means the radius (r) must be such that the circle just touches or intersects the line (4x-3y-7=0) (distance (4)) but does not intersect (4x-3y+3=0) (distance (6)).   Therefore, the radius (r) must be greater than (4) but less than (6) for the circle to satisfy the condition of intersecting at exactly two points at a distance of (1) from (4x-3y-2=0).   Thus, we conclude the range of the radius (r) is:   [   boxed{(4,6)}   ]Hence, the correct answer is (boxed{text{A}})."},{"problem":"Given that the graph of the power function y=x^{alpha} passes through the point (2, sqrt {2}), find the analytical expression of the function.","solution":"The power function is given by y=f(x)=x^{alpha}.

Consider triangles A H L, B H L, C H L, D H L. They have the side H L in common, and the sides A H, B H, C H, D H are equal to each other. Since angles A H L and C H L are right, angle B H L is acute, and angle D H L is obtuse, it follows that D L>A L=C L>B L.Since point L is equidistant from three vertices of the pyramid, we get that A L=C L=S L. Therefore, points A, C, and S lie on the circumference of the base of the cone.a) Consider triangle A B S. Let B L=2 x, S L=5 x. Then A S=7 x, A L=5 x. From the isosceles triangle A L S, we find that cos angle L S A=frac{A S}{2 S L}=frac{7}{10}. Using the cosine rule for triangle A B S, we get that A B=frac{7 x sqrt{3}}{sqrt{5}}. Therefore, frac{A S}{C D}=frac{A S}{A B}=sqrt{frac{5}{3}}.b) The height of the cone is the distance from point L to the plane A S C.

She repeats the stepseveral times until she ends up with all 1's on the whiteboard. Then the game is over, and the final score iscalculated. Let M, m be the maximum and minimum final score that can be possibly obtained respectively.Find M-m.","solution":"1. Initial Setup and Problem Understanding:   - The player starts with a score of 0 and writes the number 20 on the whiteboard.   - At each step, the player can erase any integer a and replace it with two positive integers b and c such that b + c = a. The score is then increased by b times c.   - The game continues until all numbers on the whiteboard are 1.   - We need to find the difference between the maximum and minimum possible final scores, denoted as M - m.2. Inductive Hypothesis:   - We claim that for any integer n geq 2, the total score obtained when the game ends with all 1's on the whiteboard is frac{n(n-1)}{2}.   - We will prove this by strong induction.3. Base Case:   - For n = 2, the only possible move is to replace 2 with 1 and 1. The score increases by 1 times 1 = 1.   - Thus, the final score is frac{2(2-1)}{2} = 1, which matches our hypothesis.4. Inductive Step:   - Assume that for all integers n = 2, 3, ldots, k, the final score is frac{n(n-1)}{2}.   - Consider n = k + 1. The player can replace k + 1 with j and k + 1 - j where 1 leq j leq k.   - By the inductive hypothesis, the final score for j is frac{j(j-1)}{2} and for k + 1 - j is frac{(k + 1 - j)(k - j)}{2}.   - The score for this step is j times (k + 1 - j).5. Combining Scores:   - The total score when k + 1 is replaced by j and k + 1 - j is:     [     j times (k + 1 - j) + frac{j(j-1)}{2} + frac{(k + 1 - j)(k - j)}{2}     ]   - Simplifying this expression:     [     j times (k + 1 - j) + frac{j(j-1)}{2} + frac{(k + 1 - j)(k - j)}{2} = j(k + 1 - j) + frac{j^2 - j + k^2 - k - j^2 + j}{2}     ]     [     = j(k + 1 - j) + frac{k^2 - k}{2}     ]     [     = j(k + 1 - j) + frac{k(k-1)}{2}     ]   - Since j(k + 1 - j) is the score for the current step and frac{k(k-1)}{2} is the score for the remaining steps, the total score is:     [     frac{(k + 1)k}{2}     ]   - This completes the inductive step.6. Conclusion:   - By induction, the final score for any integer n is frac{n(n-1)}{2}.   - For n = 20, the final score is:     [     frac{20 times 19}{2} = 190     ]   - Since the score is always 190 regardless of the moves, the maximum and minimum scores are both 190.   - Therefore, M - m = 190 - 190 = 0.The final answer is boxed{0}."},{"problem":"The maximum value of the function fleft(xright)=left(-4x+1right)e^{x} on the interval left[0,1right] is ______.","solution":"To find the maximum value of the function f(x) = (-4x+1)e^x on the interval [0,1], we first need to determine the behavior of the function within this interval.

First of all, note that if we have the image of the center of the sphere, point P, then |P B| will be the desired length of the radius of the sphere Omega. Thus, having an image of the sphere itself is not necessary for calculating its radius. We will construct point P based on the following considerations.138Since the sphere Omega touches the plane A B C at point B, point P lies on the perpendicular to the plane A B C erected at point B. In our drawing, we already have the image of the height of the pyramid. Through point B, draw a line m |(S O). Then, since (S O) perp (A B C), we have m perp (A B C). Therefore, P in m and [P B] is the radius of the sphere Omega.If the sphere touches the edge S A at some point D, it is clear that |A B|=|A D| (as the lengths of the tangent segments to the sphere Omega drawn from one point). But |A B|=a. Therefore, to construct point D, we need to lay off a segment A D from point A on the segment S A such that |A D|=a. Using the fact that the lengths of the edges A B and S A are given in general form, take D in [S A] arbitrarily and assume that |A D|=|A B|. (If a and b are given specific numerical values, of course, we cannot take point D arbitrarily. For example, if a=15, b=20, then |A D|:|S A|=15:20, or |A D|:|S A|=3:4, from which the construction of point D is clear.)Next, construct [P D]. Since the edge S A touches the sphere Omega, we have [P D] perp [S A] and [P D] is the radius of the sphere Omega, i.e., |P D|=|P B|. To calculate |P B|, perform the following constructions:1) [S P],2) [O B] - the segment of the median of triangle A B C,3) [P K] |[O B].Let |P B|=x and form an equation.Since |S A|=b and |A D|=a, we have |S D|=b-a.From the right triangle triangle S D P, we have:|S P|^{2}=(b-a)^{2}+x^{2} .From the right triangle triangle S B O, we have:|B O|=frac{a sqrt{3}}{3} text{ and } |S O|=sqrt{b^{2}-frac{a^{2}}{3}} .Since m |(S O) and [P K] |[O B], we have |O B|=|P K|=frac{a sqrt{3}}{3} and |P B|=|K O|=x. Then |S K|=sqrt{b^{2}-frac{a^{2}}{3}}-x.Now, from the right triangle triangle S P K, we get:begin{gathered}|S P|^{2}=|S K|^{2}+|P K|^{2}, text{ or } (b-a)^{2}+x^{2}=left(sqrt{b^{2}-frac{a^{2}}{3}}-xright)^{2}+left(frac{a sqrt{3}}{3}right)^{2} .end{gathered}Solving this equation, we find:x=frac{sqrt{3} a(2 b-a)}{2 sqrt{3 b^{2}-a^{2}}}Investigation. According to the problem, the sphere Omega touches the edge S A, i.e., D in [S A]. Thus, by the meaning of the problem, b>a. It is not difficult to verify that if this inequality is satisfied, the inequality x>0 will also be satisfied.Therefore, |P B|=frac{sqrt{3} a(2 b-a)}{2 sqrt{3 b^{2}-a^{2}}}, where b>a.Remark. We once again draw the reader's attention to the fact that the investigation is conducted based on the meaning of the problem, not on the formula obtained for the desired quantity. In the considered example, the investigation of the found value of x according to the obtained formula would have boiled down to solving the system of inequalities:left{begin{array}{l}2 b-a>0, 3 b^{2}-a^{2}>0end{array}right.(we omitted the inequalities a>0 and b>0 as self-evident). From this system, we would have obtained that b>frac{a sqrt{3}}{3}.However, this relationship is sufficient only for the existence of the pyramid itself: in the right triangle S A O, the hypotenuse will be greater than the leg. For the existence of the sphere touching the edge S A, the relationship b>frac{a sqrt{3}}{3} is insufficient. Indeed, let b=0.8 a (in this case, b>frac{a sqrt{3}}{3}). As noted above, |A D|=a.

Consider the functions ( f_p(x) = frac{1}{p}x + p ) and ( f_q(x) = frac{1}{q}x + q ).2. To find the intersection ( G_p cap G_q ), we need to solve ( f_p(x) = f_q(x) ):   [   frac{1}{p}x + p = frac{1}{q}x + q   ]3.

For ( p + q ) to be an integer, ( nl ) must divide ( ml + kn ).6.

For simplicity, we denote the projections of points and lines with the same letters as the points and lines themselves. Let us draw through point A a line p parallel to line m, and through point C a line parallel to line AB; it will intersect line p at point E. The sphere sigma denotes the surface of the sphere passing through points ABCD; since points A, B, C, D do not lie in the same plane (lines m and n are skew), such a sphere exists and is unique. Quadrilateral ABCE is a rectangle because AB bot m, CE bot m, and AB bot p; since three vertices A, B, C of this rectangle lie on the sphere sigma, the fourth vertex E also lies on sigma. The sphere sigma intersects the plane of lines n and p according to a circle passing through points A, D, E; the center S of this circle is thus the center of the circumcircle of triangle ADE; we will explain shortly how point S was constructed on Fig. 20. The center O of the sphere sigma lies on the line perpendicular to the plane ADE at point S, and thus on a line parallel to AB (since AB bot n and AB bot p). On the other hand, point O, being equidistant from points A and B, lies on the perpendicular bisector plane of segment AB, so its distance OS from the plane ADE is equal to frac{1}{2} AB. We find point O by drawing a line parallel to AB through point S and measuring SO = frac{1}{2} d in the direction from A to B.Consider triangle ASO; the angle at vertex S is a right angle, the hypotenuse OA equals the sought radius r of the sphere sigma, OS = frac{1}{2} d, and SA equals the radius of the circumcircle of triangle ADE, so SA = frac{DE}{2 sin measuredangle DAE}. But from the right triangle DEC (CE is perpendicular to the plane ADE) DE^2 = DC^2 - EC^2 = l^2 - d^2, and angle DAE equals the angle varphi between the skew lines m and n, so SA = frac{sqrt{l^2 - d^2}}{2 sin varphi}.Since in triangle ASO we have OA^2 = SO^2 + SA^2,and finallyThe construction of point S is indicated on Fig. 20 with dashed lines, and it proceeds as follows. We perform a lay of triangle ADE onto the plane of the drawing, i.e., onto the plane ABD, meaning we rotate the plane ADE around line n so that point E ends up at some point (E) in the plane of the drawing. During such a rotation, the orthogonal projection of each point in the plane ADE moves along a line perpendicular to n. Point (E) is found at the intersection of the perpendicular dropped from point E to line n and the ray drawn from point A forming an angle varphi (in its natural size) with the ray AD.Let (S) be the center of the circumcircle of triangle AD(E) and let the line A(S) intersect the line D(E) at point (M). Drawing a perpendicular from point (M) to line n to intersect at point M with line DE, and then drawing a perpendicular from point (S) to line n, we find the sought point S at the intersection of this perpendicular with line AM.Note that when points A and B and lines m and n are given, there are infinitely many segments CD of a given length l with endpoints lying on lines m and n. There are therefore infinitely many spheres passing through A and B and intersecting lines m and n at points C and D such that CD = l.

The number of ways to arrange 4 students is 4! = 24.- After arranging the students, we have 5 spaces (before the first student, between the students, and after the last student) to place the 2 teachers. The number of ways to choose 2 spaces out of 5 for the teachers is C_5^2 = 10.- Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange them is 4! times C_5^2 = 24 times 10 = 240.However, the correct calculation should be considering the permutation of the 4 students and then the permutation of the 2 teachers in the 5 spaces created, which is A_4^4 times A_5^2 = 4! times frac{5!}{(5-2)!} = 24 times 20 = 480.So, the total number of ways is boxed{480}.# (2) A is to the left of B.- First, arrange all 6 people in a row.

One person out of the remaining 4 (excluding A) must be selected for the far right, which gives C_4^1 = 4 ways to choose the person for the far right and 4! = 24 ways to arrange the remaining four people.- Therefore, the total number of ways is 5! + C_4^1 times 4! = 120 + 4 times 24 = 216.So, the total number of ways is boxed{216}.# (4) The two teachers are in the middle, with two students at each end.- There are 2! = 2 ways to arrange the two teachers in the middle.- Since the students at both ends are arranged by height from tallest to shortest, the order is fixed once the groups are decided.- There are C_4^2 = 6 ways to divide the four students into two groups for the ends.- Therefore, the total number of ways is 2 times 6 = 12.So, the total number of ways is boxed{12}."},{"problem":"7.

This suggests that the trajectory of M is a parabola that opens to the right, with its vertex at (0,0) and directrix x = -1.Let the equation of the parabola be y^2 = 2px. The focus-directrix property of the parabola gives frac{p}{2} = 1, leading to p = 2.

Since 15=1 cdot 11+4, when counting, the children's circle is only fully traversed once, and only 4 syllables remain. In this way, it follows: If in the circle there are still11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2children standing, then because15=1 cdot 11+4=1 cdot 10+5=1 cdot 9+6=1 cdot 8+7=2 cdot 7+1=2 cdot 6+3=2 cdot 5+5=3 cdot 4+3=4 cdot 3+3=7 cdot 2+1 the number of syllables can be replaced by4,5,6,7,1,3,5,3,3,1II. Now, one can (with the simplification from I. or without it) follow the counting with a \\"trial game\\" starting with child 1:Counting Rhyme1.

Therefore, the child that remains is the one that can be reached by counting 9 more (in the original arrangement) from child 1. The starting point that leads to child 1 winning is found by counting back 9 from child 1 in the original arrangement. Thus, we find:If child 1 is to win, the counting must start with child 3.b) The problem can be solved, for example, by the following BASIC program:![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_06_b85a894aa8dbf722a7b3g-1096.jpg?height=40&width=417&top_left_y=1879&top_left_x=243)110 INPUT \\"Number of syllables\\"; S120 DIM M(K)130 FOR N=K TO 2 STEP -1140 T = S - N * INT(S/N)150 IF T = 0 THEN T = N160 FOR I = 1 TO T170 GOSUB 300180 NEXT I190 M(A) = 1200 NEXT N\`\`\`![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_06_b85a894aa8dbf722a7b3g-1096.jpg?height=34&width=217&top_left_y=2302&top_left_x=243)\`\`\`220 B = 2 - A230 IF B > K THEN A = 1330 IF M(A)=1 THEN 310340 RETURN\`\`\`Meaning of the variables: K Number of children, S Number of syllables, A Number of the child reached by counting, M(A) Mark 0 or 1: Child A is still in the game or has been eliminated, N Number of children still in the game, T Simplified value for the number of syllables, I Counting stepProgram parts:100 to 120 Input, allocate memory,300 to 340 Subroutine \\"Count to the next child still in the game\\"130 to 210 \\"Trial game\\":140 to 150 Division of (mathrm{S}) by (mathrm{N}) with remainder (mathrm{T}) gives the simplified number of syllables (mathrm{T}); only 0 is replaced by (mathrm{N})160 to 210 After T counting steps, the reached child is eliminated.

Understand the distribution of ( nh(x) ):   For a given ( x in [0,1] ), ( nh(x) ) is the number of ( vartheta_i )'s that are less than ( x ). Since each ( vartheta_i ) is uniformly distributed, ( nh(x) ) follows a binomial distribution with parameters ( n ) and ( x ):   [   nh(x) sim text{Binomial}(n, x)   ]3. Set up the probability we need to find:   We need to find the probability that there exists an ( x_0 in (0,1) ) such that ( h(x_0) = x_0 ). This is equivalent to finding the probability that there exists ( k in {1, 2, ldots, n-1} ) such that:   [   hleft(frac{k}{n}right) = frac{k}{n}   ]   This can be rewritten as:   [   nhleft(frac{k}{n}right) = k   ]4.

Evaluate the sum:   To show that this sum equals ( 1 - frac{1}{n} ), we can use the fact that the sum of all binomial probabilities for ( k ) from 0 to ( n ) is 1:   [   sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} = 1 quad text{for any } p in [0,1]   ]   Here, we are summing from ( k = 1 ) to ( n-1 ) and using ( p = frac{k}{n} ).

Therefore,   [   frac{x+1}{sqrt{x^5 + x + 1}} geq frac{2(x+1)}{(x+1)(x^2 - x + 2)} = frac{2}{x^2 - x + 2}.   ]4. Summing up the cyclic terms, we get:   [   sum_{cyc} frac{x+1}{sqrt{x^5 + x + 1}} geq sum_{cyc} frac{2}{x^2 - x + 2}.   ]5. By Titu's lemma (or the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the Engel form), we have:   [   sum_{cyc} frac{2}{x^2 - x + 2} geq frac{18}{x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - x - y - z + 6}.   ]6. Using the given condition ( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = x + y + z ), we substitute:   [   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - x - y - z + 6 = 6.   ]7. Therefore,   [   sum_{cyc} frac{2}{x^2 - x + 2} geq frac{18}{6} = 3.   ]8. For equality in the AM-GM inequality, we need:   [   x^2 + x + 1 = x^3 - x^2 + 1 implies x(x^2 - 2x - 1) = 0.   ]   The non-negative solutions are ( x = 0 ) and ( x = 1 + sqrt{2} ).9. For equality in Titu's lemma, we need:   [   x^2 - x + 2 = y^2 - y + 2 implies (x - y)(x + y - 1) = 0.   ]   Since ( x, y ) being either ( 0 ) or ( 1 + sqrt{2} ) cannot sum to ( 1 ), we must have ( x = y ). Similarly, ( y = z ), so ( x = y = z ).10. Substituting ( x = y = z ) into the given condition:    [    3x^2 = 3x implies x(x - 1) = 0.    ]    Thus, ( x, y, z ) are either all ( 1 ) or all ( 0 ). Since ( 1 ) does not yield equality, the only equality case is ( x = y = z = 0 ).The final answer is ( boxed{3} )."},{"problem":"Given: The real constants a, b, c, and d satisfy the following two equations simultaneously: ① asintheta + bcostheta - c = 0; ② acostheta - bsintheta + d = 0 (where theta is any acute angle), then the relationship between a, b, c, and d is:","solution":"From equation ①, we have asintheta + bcostheta = c.Squaring both sides, we get a^2sin^2theta + b^2cos^2theta + 2absinthetacostheta = c^2 ③From equation ②, we have acostheta - bsintheta = -d.Squaring both sides, we get a^2cos^2theta + b^2sin^2theta - 2absinthetacostheta = d^2 ④Adding equations ③ and ④, we obtaina^2(sin^2theta + cos^2theta) + b^2(sin^2theta + cos^2theta) = c^2 + d^2Therefore, a^2 + b^2 = c^2 + d^2.So, the relationship between a, b, c, and d is boxed{a^2 + b^2 = c^2 + d^2}."},{"problem":"1.

The calculation process isbegin{aligned}V & =frac{1}{4} cdot 4 x cdot(80-2 x) cdot(50-2 x) & leqslant frac{1}{4} cdotleft(frac{4 x+80-2 x+50-2 x}{3}right)^{3} & =frac{130^{3}}{108} .end{aligned}x is eliminated, but the condition for equality to hold is:4 x=80-2 x=50-2 xThis equation clearly has no solution.Therefore, the above solution is incorrect.To obtain the condition for equality to hold and to find the maximum value of the volume V, the correct solution isbegin{aligned}V & =frac{1}{12} cdot 6 x cdot(80-2 x) cdot 2(50-2 x) & leqslant frac{1}{12} cdotleft[frac{6 x+(80-2 x)+2(50-2 x)}{3}right]^{3} & =frac{1}{12} cdot frac{180^{3}}{3^{3}} & =18000 .end{aligned}In the above inequality, the condition for equality to hold is6 x=80-2 x=2(50-2 x)That isx=10 text {. }Therefore, when and only when x=10, the volume V has a maximum value, and the maximum value is 18000.This solution is very simple, but why multiply x by 6 and 50-2 x by 2? That is, why transformV=x(80-2 x)(50-2 x)intoV=frac{1}{12} cdot 6 x cdot(80-2 x) cdot 2(50-2 x)to make the sum in the inequality a constant and the equality hold?The coefficients in the above expression are the result of a general problem-solving strategy.We first express the coefficients of x, 80-2 x, 50-2 x in the expression of V using a generalized parameter, at this timebegin{aligned}V & =frac{1}{alpha beta gamma} cdot alpha x cdot beta(50-2 x) cdot gamma(80-2 x) & leqslant frac{1}{alpha beta gamma} cdotleft(frac{alpha x+50 beta-2 beta x+80 gamma-2 gamma x}{3}right)^{3} & =frac{1}{alpha beta gamma} cdotleft[frac{(50 beta+80 gamma)+(alpha-2 beta-2 gamma) x}{3}right]^{3} .end{aligned}To make the above expression independent of x, we needalpha-2 beta-2 gamma=0 .To make the equality hold, we also needalpha x=50 beta-2 beta x=80 gamma-2 gamma x .For computational convenience, we can set gamma=1, then the above two equations can be transformed intoleft{begin{array}{l}alpha=2 beta+2, alpha x=50 beta-2 beta x=80-2 x,end{array}right.Solving these, we getbeta=-frac{4}{5} quad text { or } beta=2 text {. }We take beta=2, then alpha=6.This is the reason why we transform V intoV=frac{1}{12} cdot 6 x cdot(80-2 x) cdot 2(50-2 x)In solving this problem, we generalize the coefficients of x, 80-2 x, 50-2 x, treating x, 80-2 x, 50-2 x as expressions with parameters 2 x, beta(80-2 x), gamma(50-2 x). These parameters alpha, beta, gamma are dynamic and are fixed at a certain moment to meet the needs of the solution. The generalized parameters then become specific values. Without this generalization process, the maximum value of V would be difficult to find."},{"problem":"On the table lay eight cards with numbers 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19. Ferda picked three cards.

This is because the definition of a parallelogram requires both pairs of opposite sides to be parallel, not just one. Therefore, this statement does not necessarily describe a parallelogram exclusively. Hence, Statement A is textbf{incorrect}.- Statement B: A quadrilateral with diagonals that are perpendicular to each other could be a rhombus, as one of the properties of a rhombus is that its diagonals are perpendicular. However, this property alone does not guarantee the quadrilateral is a rhombus, as other quadrilaterals, like some kites, also have perpendicular diagonals. Therefore, Statement B is textbf{incorrect} because it is not exclusively true for rhombuses.- Statement C: A quadrilateral with one angle of 90^{circ} and one pair of adjacent sides equal does not necessarily make it a square. A square is a special type of rectangle where all sides are equal, and all angles are 90^{circ}.

Room 5 is not adjacent to room 1, since Črt could otherwise walk from room 5 to room 1 three times, first from room 5 to room 1, then back to room 5, and then again to room 1.

If it were directly connected to room 2, for example, Črt could slide from room 5 back to room 5 in exactly three tunnels, by sliding from room 5 to room 2 in exactly two tunnels and then directly from room 2 to room 5. Since Črt can slide from room 5 to room 2 in exactly two tunnels and room 5 can only be adjacent to room 4, the pairs of rooms that must be directly connected are 5 and 4, 4 and 2, and 4 and 3.

This can be represented as:- The first number is 2^1 = 2,- The second number is 2^2 = 4,- The third number is 2^3 = 8,- The fourth number is 2^4 = 16,- And so on.This pattern suggests that the numerator of the nth number is 2^n.Step 2: Analyzing the DenominatorsFor the denominators, we notice that each is obtained by adding 3 to a power of 2 that corresponds to the numerator's power. This can be represented as:- The first denominator is 2^1 + 3 = 5,- The second denominator is 2^2 + 3 = 7,- The third denominator is 2^3 + 3 = 11,- The fourth denominator is 2^4 + 3 = 19,- And so on.This pattern suggests that the denominator of the nth number is 2^n + 3.Step 3: Formulating the nth NumberCombining the observations from steps 1 and 2, the nth number in Xiaoming's sequence can be expressed as a fraction with the numerator as 2^n and the denominator as 2^n + 3.

We will use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that for a right triangle with side lengths (a), (b), and (c) (where (c) is the hypotenuse), the relationship (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) must hold.1. Identify the possible Pythagorean triples:   - The possible Pythagorean triples that can be formed with the numbers on the dice (1 to 6, 1 to 8, and 1 to 10) are:     - ((3, 4, 5))     - ((6, 8, 10))2.

Consider an arbitrary prime divisor r of M. Notice that M is odd, so r geqslant 3. By (2), the multiplicative order of left((p+q) cdot(p-q)^{-1}right) modulo r is a divisor of the exponent 2 q in (2), so it can be 1,2, q or 2 q. By Fermat's theorem, the order divides r-1. So, if the order is q or 2 q then r equiv 1(bmod q). If the order is 1 or 2 then r mid(p+q)^{2}-(p-q)^{2}=4 p q, so r=p or r=q. The case r=p is not possible, because, by applying Fermat's theorem, M=(p+q)^{p-q}(p-q)^{p+q}-1 equiv q^{p-q}(-q)^{p+q}-1=left(q^{2}right)^{p}-1 equiv q^{2}-1=(q+1)(q-1) quad(bmod p) and the last factors q-1 and q+1 are less than p and thus p nmid M.

Also, let T(0 ; b) be the point of intersection of the given line with the ordinate axis, and C be the point of intersection of the circle with the ordinate axis, different from O.Triangle Q O C is isosceles (Q O=Q C as radii), and Q T is its height, hence Q T is also a median, C T=O T, so the point C has coordinates (0 ; 2 b). Drop a perpendicular A H from point A to the ordinate axis. Then angle T A H is the angle of inclination of the line, its tangent is frac{3}{4}.

First, we need to understand the total distance the ant travels around the perimeter of the equilateral triangle triangle ABC.

Define the function and variables:   Let ( f(x) = (x | x |)^2 ) and ( m_i ) be the nearest integer to ( x_i ). If ( | x_i | = 0.5 ), let ( m_i = x_i - 0.5 ). Let ( { x_i } = text{sgn}(x_i - m_i) times | x_i | ).2. Step 1: Smoothing the values:   For any two ( x_a ) and ( x_b ) such that ( -0.5 < { x_a } < 0 < { x_b } < 0.5 ), note that ( (x_a, x_b) rightarrow (x_a - varepsilon, x_b + varepsilon) ) increases the sum of ( f(x_a) + f(x_b) ). We repeat this until one of ( { x_a }, { x_b } ) is equal to 0.5. Henceforth, we may assume ( { x_i } ) are all positive or all negative with none or some equal to 0.5.3. Step 2: Rearranging the integer parts:   Suppose ( | x_a | le | x_b | ). If ( m_a > m_b ), then note:   [   f(x_a - m_a + m_b) + f(x_b + m_a - m_b) = (x_a - m_a + m_b)^2 | x_a |^2 + (x_b + m_a - m_b)^2 | x_b |^2 ge (x_a | x_a |)^2 + (x_b | x_b |)^2 = f(x_a) + f(x_b)   ]   where the inequality holds by Rearrangement. So, we shift ( x_a ) and ( x_b ) accordingly. Repeating this across all possible pairs ( (x_a, x_b) ) arranges the ( x_i ) in the same order of ( | x_i | ).4. Step 3: Adjusting the fractional parts:   Consider any ( x_a, x_b ) such that ( 0.5 > | x_a | ge | x_b | ). We shift ( x_a ) and ( x_b ) such that ( | x_a | ) increases while ( | x_b | ) decreases, keeping ( m_a ) and ( m_b ) constant (unless one of ( | x_a |, | x_b | ) becomes 0.5). If ( m_a = m_b ), then ( x_a, x_b ) are on the function ( f(x) = x^2 (m_a - x)^2 ), which is convex, so ( f(x_a) + f(x_b) ) also increases. Otherwise, ( m_a > m_b ), and consequently ( x_a > x_b ). Then note ( f(x_a) = x_a^2 (m_a - x_a)^2 ) and ( f(x_b) = x_b^2 (m_b - x_b)^2 ), and a quick computation finds that ( |f'(x_a)| > |f'(x_b)| ), so this also increases the sum ( f(x_a) + f(x_b) ). This process ends when ( | x_a | ) reaches 0.5 or when ( | x_b | ) reaches 0. Now we repeat this process, performing step 2 also after each iteration of this process (which reorders the integer parts). At the end, we are left with ( x_1, x_2, dots, x_n in {0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, dots, n-0.5, n} ).5. Step 4: Maximizing the sum:   Select the largest among ( x_1, x_2, dots, x_n ), and WLOG it is ( x_n ). For any ( x_i in mathbb{Z}^+ ), replace ( (x_i, x_n) rightarrow (0, x_i + x_n) ). This clearly increases the sum ( f(x_i) + f(x_n) ). The rest of the points belong to the set ( {0, 0.5, 1.5, dots, n-0.5} ), and the corresponding ( f(x_i) ) values lie on the curve ( f(x) = frac{x^2}{4} ). This curve is convex, so the sum ( f(x_1) + cdots + f(x_n) ) achieves a maximum when the ( x_i ) are at the (discrete) endpoints, which is when ( x_1, x_2, dots, x_{n-2} = 0 ), ( x_{n-1} = 0.5 ), and ( x_n = n - 0.5 ).6. Final Calculation:   [   sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2 = (0.5 cdot 0.5)^2 + ((n - 0.5) cdot 0.5)^2 = frac{0.5^2}{4} + frac{(n - 0.5)^2}{4} = frac{0.25}{4} + frac{(n - 0.5)^2}{4} = frac{0.25 + (n - 0.5)^2}{4}   ]   [   = frac{0.25 + n^2 - n + 0.25}{4} = frac{n^2 - n + 0.5}{4}   ]The final answer is (boxed{frac{n^2 - n + 0.5}{4}})"},{"problem":"14.

Let's provide an example of coloring in 7 colors that satisfies the condition of the problem. Consider a 7 by 7 square, and color it in the required way using 7 colors with a known technique: the coloring of each subsequent row is obtained from the coloring of the previous row by a cyclic shift of 2 cells. Then, we select the left lower corner 6 by 6 square from it, which will be the required example.Let's prove the minimality of 7 colors. Each row of the square contains 6 cells, so at least 6 colors are required for a correct coloring. Suppose we managed to color the square in 6 colors in the required way, then there will be exactly 6 cells of each color, and they will all be in different verticals and horizontals of the square. Let's call the color of the left lower corner cell A of the square black, and show that the remaining 5 black cells cannot be located in the upper right 5 by 5 square in different verticals and horizontals and at the same time not lie on its main diagonal, already controlled by cell A. Otherwise, we can assume that at least three of them would be located below the main diagonal in a \\"staircase\\" figure consisting of 10 cells, made up of 4 strips of 4, 3, 2, and 1 cells respectively. However, it is directly verified that for any cell of the \\"staircase,\\" cells not in the same row, column, or diagonal can correctly contain no more than one black cell. The possible positions of this second black cell are shown in the figure.

Therefore,R_{k}=1+10+10^{2}+ldots+10^{k-1}=frac{10^{k}-1}{9}Thus,0frac{k}{10} n-2 n=frac{k-20}{10} cdot nAccording to (2) and (3), similarly, on the one hand,Q_{n}=(n+1) k-R_{k}>n k-2 n=(k-2) nand on the other hand,Q_{n}<(k+1) nBased on these, we can set bounds for the ratio frac{P_{n}}{Q_{n}}:frac{k-20}{k+1} cdot frac{1}{10}<frac{P_{n}}{Q_{n}}<frac{k+12}{k-2} cdot frac{1}{10}Here, the limit of both sides is frac{1}{10}, since k also tends to infinity as n does.

As is often the case with us, there were three defendants, and only one of them was guilty. When the first defendant was asked if he pleaded guilty, his answer was brief: either 'yes' or 'no,' though I can't recall which. Then the second defendant was asked if he pleaded guilty. His answer was also one-word: either 'yes' or 'no,' though I also can't remember which. Then the third defendant was asked whether the first defendant was guilty or not, and the third defendant either said that the first defendant was not guilty or claimed that the first defendant was guilty. But what exactly the third defendant said has faded from my memory. Do you have any idea who is guilty?\\"\\"Of course not!\\" Alice replied.\\"I also couldn't determine who was guilty,\\" the White Knight admitted. \\"But I remember something else: I forgot who among the defendants was telling the truth and who was lying, but I clearly remember that at least one of them was telling the truth and at least one was lying.

At that time, I still remembered what each defendant had said, and I recounted their statements to the Baboon. I also told the Baboon that at least one of the three defendants was telling the truth and at least one was lying. Upon learning this, the Baboon, through logical reasoning, managed to find the guilty party.Now Alice (and, therefore, you, the reader) has enough information to solve the problem.Who is guilty?","solution":"83. Another case. There are 8 versions of the testimonies given by the defendants (boldsymbol{A}), (boldsymbol{B}), and (C) during the trial. Indeed, (A) could give two versions of his testimony, each of which could be combined with two versions of (B)'s testimony, resulting in 4 versions of the testimonies of (A) and (B). (Let's list these versions: 1) (A) and (B) both admitted guilt; 2) (A) admitted guilt, (B) claimed innocence; 3) (A) claimed innocence, (B) admitted guilt; 4) (A) and (B) both claimed innocence.) Each of the four versions of the testimonies of (A) and (B) corresponds to two versions of (C)'s testimony, so the total number of testimonies of (A), (B), and (C) reaches 8.In each of the 8 versions of the testimonies, any of the three could be guilty (at least in principle). Therefore, the total number of \\"scenarios\\" (by which we mean a set of each of the three defendants' testimonies and their actual guilt or innocence) reaches 24. Of course, if we knew which of the 24 versions corresponds to reality, we would know who was lying and who was telling the truth. Therefore, let's compile a summary table of all 24 scenarios.

In case 5B (at the intersection of row 5 and the column \\"B guilty\\"), we see that (A) is lying, (B) is lying, and (C) is telling the truth. (By case 5B, we mean the scenario where (A) admitted guilt, (B) claimed innocence, (C) stated that (A) is innocent, and in reality, (B) is guilty.Other examples: in case 8C, all three defendants lied; in case 3B, all three told the truth; in case 4C, defendant (A) told the truth, while (B) and (C) lied.Barmaglot, after learning what each defendant said and that at least one statement was true and at least one was false, was able to determine who was guilty. What information, which the White Knight could have provided, allowed Barmaglot to determine who was guilty? Suppose Barmaglot learned from the White Knight that (A) claimed innocence, (B) claimed innocence, and (C) claimed (A) was innocent (thus we are within case 1). With this information, Barmaglot could have excluded the guilt of defendant (C) (since in case 1C, all three defendants lied), but perhaps he could not have determined who was guilty: (A) or (B) (since in case 1C, at least one statement was true and at least one was false; a similar situation is observed in case 1B). Therefore, the White Knight could not have provided Barmaglot with this information (since Barmaglot determined who was guilty). How would things have been in case 2 (where (A) claimed innocence, (B) claimed innocence, and (C) claimed (A) was guilty)? In this case, Barmaglot could not have determined who was guilty (since both case 2A and case 2B could have occurred). We encounter a different situation in case 3, where at least one true and at least one false statement are possible only in sub-case 3C. Therefore, if the White Knight had informed Barmaglot that (A) claimed innocence, (B) claimed innocence, and (C) claimed (A) was innocent, Barmaglot, through reasoning, would have concluded that (C) was guilty. Therefore, it is not excluded that the White Knight provided Barmaglot with this information. By analyzing the other cases (4, 5, 6, 7, and 8), the reader will find that only in case 6 (in addition to the already known case 3) could Barmaglot have determined who among the three defendants was guilty. As in case 3, the guilty party would be defendant (C).Thus, regardless of whether the testimonies the White Knight told Barmaglot belonged to case 3 or case 6, in both cases, the guilty party (by a fortunate coincidence) would have been defendant (C)."},{"problem":"15.

Points on the circle Gamma are symmetric to themselves with respect to this circle.For the center O of the circle Gamma, the symmetric point with respect to Gamma is the point at infinity.If the center of the circle Gamma is at the origin and one of the points symmetric with respect to Gamma represents the complex number z, then the other corresponds to the complex number frac{boldsymbol{R}^{2}}{bar{z}}.The transformation w=frac{1}{z} consists of two symmetric reflections: with respect to the unit circle and with respect to the real axis (Fig. 18) and is called inversion.The transformation w=frac{1}{z} is conformal in the entire extended plane, with the point z=0 corresponding to the point w=infty, and the point z=infty corresponding to the point w=0. (It is assumed that the angle between lines at the infinitely distant point in one of the planes (z or w) is equal to the angle between the images of these lines at the origin in the other plane). Circles (as well as lines) under the mapping w=frac{1}{z} transform into circles or lines.

The factors x and z-1 can be determined by realizing that z is a two-digit number, so 9 leq z-1 leq 98. We see that necessarily z-1=12 and x=167, hence z=13. Martin therefore calculated the number V=(167+y) cdot 13. The number V is thus a four-digit number, and since it reads the same forwards and backwards, it has the form overline{a b b a}=1001 a+110 b. Since 1001=13 cdot 77, the equation (167+y) cdot 13=13 cdot 77 a+110 b must hold, from which it follows that the digit b is divisible by thirteen, so b=0. Substituting this, we get (after dividing by thirteen) the equation 167+y=77 a, which, considering the inequalities 10 leq y leq 99, means that the digit a equals 3, thus y=64.In the second part of the solution, we could also proceed as follows. For the number V=(167+y) cdot 13, the inequalities 10 leq y leq 99 yield the estimates 2301 leq V leq 3458.

By reflecting at the angle bisector w of this angle, A is mapped to A^{prime}, and thus Q^{prime} is mapped to Q. Consequently, due to the direction of traversal, B is mapped to B^{prime}, C to C^{prime}, D to D^{prime}, and the intersection point P_{1} of AB and A^{prime}B^{prime}, which exists because 0^{circ}<alpha<90^{circ}, is mapped to itself. Therefore, P_{1} lies on w.The segments AB and A^{prime}B^{prime} intersect at the point P_{1} on AB for which angle A Z P_{1}=frac{alpha}{2}. Similarly, it follows that:AB and D^{prime}A^{prime} intersect at the point P_{2} on AB for which angle B Z P_{2}=frac{90^{circ}-alpha}{2}=45^{circ}-frac{alpha}{2}.Since angle A Z P_{2}=frac{alpha}{2}+45^{circ}, and because 0^{circ}<frac{alpha}{2}<frac{alpha}{2}+45^{circ}<90^{circ}, the segment P_{1}P_{2} is thus a side of the polygonal area Q cap Q^{prime}.Similarly, we find the further intersection points P_{3}, P_{4} of BC with D^{prime}A^{prime} and C^{prime}D^{prime}, respectively, P_{5}, P_{6} of CD with C^{prime}D^{prime} and B^{prime}C^{prime}, and P_{7}, P_{8} of DA with B^{prime}C^{prime} and A^{prime}B^{prime}, and thus Q cap Q^{prime} as the octagonal area P_{1}P_{2} ldots P_{8}.By reflecting at w, the intersection point P_{2} of AB and D^{prime}A^{prime} is mapped to the intersection point of A^{prime}B^{prime} and DA, i.e., to P_{8}. Therefore, P_{1}P_{2}=P_{1}P_{8}.Similarly, it follows that any two adjacent sides of Q cap Q^{prime} have the same length s=P_{1}P_{2}, so u(Q cap Q^{prime})=8s.Because angle A^{prime}Z^{prime}B^{prime}=90^{circ} and 0^{circ}<alpha<90^{circ}, the segments ZA and A^{prime}B^{prime} intersect at a point R, and it holds that angle A R P_{8}=angle A^{prime} R Z (vertical angles) and angle R A P_{8}=45^{circ}=angle R A^{prime} Z. Therefore, angle P_{1} P_{8} A=angle R P_{8} A=alpha (angle sum in the triangle), and because angle P_{1} A P_{8}=90^{circ}, we have A P_{1}=s cdot sin alpha.Similarly, we obtain angle P_{2} P_{3} B=90^{circ}-alpha, so P_{2} B=s cdot cos alpha. Frombegin{gathered}a=A P_{1}+P_{1} P_{2}+P_{2} B=s(sin alpha+1+cos alpha) quad text { it follows that } s=frac{a}{1+sin alpha+cos alpha}end{gathered}Now,sin alpha+cos alpha=sqrt{2}left(cos alpha cdot cos 45^{circ}+sin alpha cdot sin 45^{circ}right)=sqrt{2} cos left(alpha-45^{circ}right)because -45^{circ}<alpha-45^{circ}<45^{circ}, it attains its maximum value for exactly alpha-45^{circ}=0, and this value is sqrt{2}. Therefore, for all Q, Q^{prime} in M with Q neq Q^{prime}, there exists a smallest possible value of u(Q cap Q^{prime})=8s, and this value isfrac{8a}{1+sqrt{2}}=8a(sqrt{2}-1)Since sqrt{2}-1<frac{1}{2}, and thus 8a(sqrt{2}-1)<4a, this is also the smallest possible value of u(Q cap Q^{prime}) for all Q, Q^{prime} in M even when Q=Q^{prime} is allowed.## Adapted from [3]"},{"problem":"Given i^1 = i, i^2 = -1, i^3 = -i, i^4 = 1, i^5 = i, ..., it can be inferred that i^{2010} = （ ）A: 1B: -1C: iD: -i","solution":"From the problem, the operation of the power of i appears in a cycle of 4.
