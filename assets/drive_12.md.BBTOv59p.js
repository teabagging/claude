In this case, the n lines exactly divide the plane into p_{n} parts.Second, we use mathematical induction to prove that n planes can divide the space into at mostq_{n}=frac{1}{6}left(n^{3}+5 n+6right)parts, and this is achieved if and only if the n planes are in general position, i.e., the intersection lines of any two planes with the third plane are not parallel, and no four planes intersect at the same point. In this case, the n planes exactly divide the space into q_{n} parts.When n=0, q(0)=1, i.e., the proposition holds for n=0. Assume the proposition holds for n=k. When n=k+1, by the induction hypothesis, the first k planes can divide the space into at most q_{k} parts, and exactly into q_{k} parts if the k planes are in general position. Now, add one more plane, which intersects the first k planes in k lines. These k lines can divide the (k+1)-th plane into at most p_{k} parts, and exactly into p_{k} parts if the k lines are in general position. Each of these at most p_{k} planar regions divides its corresponding spatial region into two, thus increasing the number of spatial regions by at most p_{k}.

Find all natural numbers n such that the number 2^{n}+n^{2}+25 is a cube of a prime number.","solution":"Answer: n=6Solution. Let 2^{n}+n^{2}+25=p^{3} for some prime number p. Since p>3, p is an odd prime number. Then n is an even number, and 2^{n} gives a remainder of 1 when divided by three. If n is not divisible by three, then n^{2} gives a remainder of 1 when divided by three, and then 2^{n}+n^{2}+25 is divisible by three, which is impossible. Therefore, n is divisible by six and can be written as n=6 k. Consequently, 2^{n}+n^{2}+25=64^{k}+36 k^{2}+25>left(4^{k}right)^{3}. Therefore,64^{k}+36 k^{2}+25 geqslantleft(4^{k}+1right)^{3}=64^{k}+3 cdot 16^{k}+3 cdot 4^{k}+1 .If k geqslant 2, then 3 cdot 4^{k}>25 and 3 cdot 16^{k} geqslant 36 k^{2} (the latter follows, for example, from the easily verifiable by induction inequality 4^{k} geqslant 6 k). Thus, k=1 and n=6. It remains to verify that such n works: 2^{6}+6^{2}+25=125=5^{3}."},{"problem":"A crazy physicist has discovered a new particle called an omon. He has a machine, which takes two omons of mass a and b and entangles them; this process destroys the omon with mass a, preserves the one with mass b, and creates a new omon whose mass is frac 12 (a+b). The physicist can then repeat the process with the two resulting omons, choosing which omon to destroy at every step. The physicist initially has two omons whose masses are distinct positive integers less than 1000. What is the maximum possible number of times he can use his machine without producing an omon whose mass is not an integer?[i]Proposed by Michael Kural[/i]","solution":"1. Initial Setup: We start with two omons of masses (a) and (b), where (a) and (b) are distinct positive integers less than 1000. Without loss of generality, assume (a < b).2. Entanglement Process: The machine destroys the omon with mass (a), preserves the omon with mass (b), and creates a new omon with mass (frac{a + b}{2}). This process can be repeated with the new pair of omons.3. Mass Difference Analysis: Let (d = b - a). After the first entanglement, the new masses are (b) and (frac{a + b}{2}). The difference between these new masses is:   [   b - frac{a + b}{2} = frac{2b - (a + b)}{2} = frac{b - a}{2} = frac{d}{2}   ]   Thus, each entanglement halves the difference between the masses of the two omons.4. Integer Mass Condition: For the mass of the new omon to remain an integer, (frac{a + b}{2}) must be an integer. This implies that (a + b) must be even, which is always true since (a) and (b) are both integers.5. Maximum Number of Steps: We need to determine the maximum number of times the physicist can use the machine without producing a non-integer mass. This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of times we can halve the initial difference (d) before it becomes less than 1.6. Initial Difference: The maximum initial difference (d) is (999) (since (a) and (b) are distinct integers less than 1000).7. Halving Process: We need to find the largest (n) such that:   [   frac{999}{2^n} geq 1   ]   Solving for (n):   [   999 geq 2^n implies n leq log_2(999)   ]   Calculating (log_2(999)):   [   log_2(999) approx 9.96   ]   Since (n) must be an integer, the maximum (n) is 9.8. Verification: We can verify this by considering the sequence of differences:   [   999, 499.5, 249.75, 124.875, 62.4375, 31.21875, 15.609375, 7.8046875, 3.90234375, 1.951171875   ]   After 9 steps, the difference is still greater than 1, but after the 10th step, it becomes less than 1, indicating a non-integer mass.Conclusion:The maximum number of times the physicist can use his machine without producing an omon whose mass is not an integer is (boxed{9})."},{"problem":"Given a sequence left{ a_n right} is a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2, and a_2, a_3+1, a_4 are in arithmetic sequence in order.

Use the properties of angle bisectors and the circumcircle:   - The angle bisectors of angle ABC and angle ACB intersect Gamma at points E and F respectively.   - Since E and F lie on the circumcircle, angle BAE = angle CAE and angle CAF = angle BAF.3. Consider the tangency condition:   - EF is tangent to the incircle gamma of triangle ABC.   - The tangency condition implies that EF is perpendicular to the line segment joining the incenter I to the point of tangency.4. Use the fact that EF bisects AI:   - Since EF is tangent to the incircle and perpendicular to AI, it must bisect AI.   - This implies that AI is the diameter of the circle with EF as the tangent.5. Relate the inradius r to the angle angle BAC:   - Let the inradius be r.   - Since AI is perpendicular to EF and EF bisects AI, we have AI = 2r.   - The angle angle BAC can be expressed in terms of the angles at E and F.6.

For this, we observe that there are 3 types of non-empty subsets of {1, ldots, n+1}: those that do not contain n+1, those that contain n+1 and something else, and {n+1}. If we consider a subset of the first type, its contribution will be the same as with n elements, and the total contribution of subsets of the first type is therefore a_{n}. If we consider a subset of the second type, we can write it as Y=n+1 cup X, with X subset{1, ldots, n}, X neq emptyset. When we multiply the elements of Y, we get n+1 times what we get by multiplying those of X, and thus, by inverting and factoring, the contribution of subsets of the second type is frac{a_{n}}{n+1}. Finally,a_{n+1}=a_{n}+frac{a_{n}}{n+1}+frac{1}{n+1}By testing with small values of n, we conjecture that a_{n}=n. We prove this by induction using the formula we have found. We already have a_{1}=1.

Since A, B, and C are acute angles, we have tan A > 0, tan B > 0, tan C > 0,  From equation (2), we get 1 - tan Btan C  1,  tan Atan Btan C = -frac{3t^2}{1 - t} = -frac{3}{frac{1}{t^2} - frac{1}{t}}, frac{1}{t^2} - frac{1}{t} = left(frac{1}{t} - frac{1}{2}right)^2 - frac{1}{4}, since t > 1, we have -frac{1}{4} leq frac{1}{t^2} - frac{1}{t} < 0,  Therefore, the minimum value of tan Atan Btan C is boxed{12}.  The answer is: 12.  By combining the relationship of the triangle and the equation sin A = 2sin Bsin C, we can deduce sin Bcos C + cos Bsin C = 3sin Bsin C, and then get tan B + tan C = 3tan Btan C, combining the characteristics of the function to find the minimum value.

Identify the slope of the given line: The slope of the line x-y-2=0 can be found by rearranging it into slope-intercept form (y=mx+b), which gives us y=x-2. Thus, the slope (m) is 1.2. Find the derivative of f(x) to determine the slope of the tangent at any point on the curve: We have f(x) = x^{2} - ln x, so the derivative f'(x), which gives the slope of the tangent line at any point on f(x), is f'(x) = 2x - dfrac{1}{x}.3. Set the slope of the tangent equal to the slope of the given line to find where they are parallel: Since the minimum distance occurs when the tangent line to the curve at point P is parallel to the given line, we set f'(x) = 1 (the slope of the given line). This gives us 2x - dfrac{1}{x} = 1.4. Solve for x to find the points of tangency: Solving 2x - dfrac{1}{x} = 1 for x, we rearrange to get 2x^2 - x - 1 = 0.

Calculate the coordinates of the point of tangency: With x=1, we find the corresponding y value on the curve f(x), which is y=f(1)=1^{2}-ln(1)=1 (since ln(1)=0). Therefore, the point of tangency is (1,1).6. Calculate the distance from the point of tangency to the given line: The distance d from a point (x_0,y_0) to a line Ax+By+C=0 is given by d=dfrac{|Ax_0+By_0+C|}{sqrt{A^2+B^2}}. For the point (1,1) and the line x-y-2=0 (which can be rewritten as 1cdot x - 1cdot y - 2 = 0), this gives d=dfrac{|1cdot1-1cdot1-2|}{sqrt{1^2+(-1)^2}}=dfrac{|-2|}{sqrt{2}}=sqrt{2}.Therefore, the minimum distance from point P on the curve to the line x-y-2=0 is boxed{sqrt{2}}.Hence, the correct answer is: boxed{text{A}}."},{"problem":"70. For which natural numbers n is the sum 5^{n}+n^{5} divisible by 13? What is the smallest n that satisfies this condition?","solution":"70. First, let's find the remainders of the division by 13 of the numbers (5^n) and (n^5) for the first few values of (n = 0, 1, 2, ldots). It is more convenient to start with the numbers (5^n):(n)| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | . | . | . || ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: || 1 | 5 | 25 | 125 | 625 | . | . | . || 1 | 5 | -1 | -5 | 1 | . | . | . |[Here we write the remainder -1 instead of \\"remainder 12\\" and \\"remainder -3\\" instead of \\"remainder 8\\", which allows us to easily find all subsequent remainders: if (5^n) gives a remainder of -1 when divided by 13, i.e., (5^n = 13k - 1), where (k) is an integer, then (5^{n+1} = 5^n cdot 5 = (13k - 1) cdot 5 = 13(5k) - 5) gives a remainder of -5 when divided by 13; similarly, if (5^m) gives a remainder of -5 when divided by 13, i.e., (5^m = 13l - 5), then (5^{m+1} = 5^m cdot 5 = (13l - 5) cdot 5 = 13(5l) - 25 = 13(5l - 2) + 1) gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 13.] There is no need to continue the table further: since (5^4 = 13q + 1), then (5^5 = 5^4 cdot 5 = (13q + 1) cdot 5) gives the same remainder as the number 5 (remainder 5) when divided by 13; the number (5^6 = 5^4 cdot 5^2 = (13q + 1) cdot 5^2) gives the same remainder as the number (5^2) (remainder -1) when divided by 13, and so on; thus, in our \\"sequence of remainders,\\" the numbers (1, 5, -1, -5) alternate sequentially.Similarly, we can create a table of remainders from the division by 13 of the numbers (n^5), where (n = 0, 1, 2, ldots), and so on. But the number ((13p + r)^5 = frac{(13p + r)(13p + r) ldots (13p + r)}{5 text{ factors}}) gives the same remainder as the number (r^5) when divided by 13; therefore, it is sufficient to limit ourselves to the values (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ldots, 12). Further, if the number (n) is equal to (or gives a remainder of) (s) when divided by 13, and the number (n^2) gives a remainder of (t) when divided by 13, then the number (n^5 = n^2 cdot n^2 cdot n) gives the same remainder as the product (t cdot t cdot s) when divided by 13—this fact can simplify the creation of the required table for the values (n = 4, 5, 6). Finally, note that if the number (n^5) gives a remainder of (u) when divided by 13, then the number ((13 - n)^5 = underbrace{(13 - n)(13 - n) ldots (13 - n)}) gives the same remainder as the number ((-n)^5), i.e., the remainder -u, or (13 - u).Now we can create our table:![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_b937612abb2773f7abffg-128.jpg?height=648&width=971&top_left_y=176&top_left_x=52)(The remainders corresponding to the values (n = 7, 8, ldots, 12) are written based on the fact that the numbers (n^5) and ((13 - n)^5) give \\"complementary\\" remainders (u) and (-u).) After the value (n = 12) in our table, the same remainders (0, 1, 6, -4, -3, 5, 2, -2, -5, 3, 4, -6, -1) will \\"periodically\\" repeat.Since the first table has a \\"period\\" of 4, and the second has a \\"period\\" of 13, the value (4 cdot 13 = 52) is the \\"period\\" of the combination of both tables: increasing (n) by 52 (or any multiple of 52) does not change the remainders of the division by 13 of both numbers (5^n) and (n^5). Further, we are only interested in those columns of the second table that correspond to remainders (pm 1) and (pm 5) (since in the first table, only the remainders (1, 5, -1, -5) alternate). But within the range from (n = 0) to (n = 51), the remainder 1 in the second table corresponds to the values (n = 1, 1 + 13 = 14), (1 + 2 cdot 13 = 27), and (1 + 3 cdot 13 = 40); of these four numbers, only 14 has the form (4x + 2), which in the first table corresponds to the remainder -1; thus, the number (n = 14) satisfies the required condition ((5^{14} + 14^5) is divisible by 13). Similarly, the remainder -1 in the second table within the same range corresponds to the values (n = 12, 12 + 13 = 25), (12 + 2 cdot 13 = 38), and (12 + 3 cdot 13 = 51); of these numbers, only 12 has the form (4y), which in the first table leads to the remainder 1. Similarly, the remainder 5 in the second table corresponds to the values (n = 5, 5 + 13 = 18), (5 + 2 cdot 13 = 31), and (5 + 3 cdot 13 = 44), and the remainder -5 to the values (n = 8, 8 + 13 = 21), (8 + 2 cdot 13 = 34), and (8 + 3 cdot 13 = 47); but of the first four numbers, only 31 has the form (4z + 3), ensuring a remainder of -5 from the division of (5^{31}) by 13, and of the last four numbers, only 21 has the form (4tau + 1), ensuring a remainder of 5 from the division of (5^{21}) by 13. Thus, within the range (0 leq n leq 52), the required condition is satisfied by the following four natural numbers: (n = 12, 14), 21, and 31; the entire set of natural numbers satisfying the condition of the problem consists of the following four \\"series\\" of numbers:[begin{gathered}n = 52m + 12, quad n = 52m + 14 text{ (i.e., } n = 26(2m) + 12 quad n = 26(2m + 1) - 12)end{gathered}][n = 52m + 21 quad text{and} quad n = 52m + 31 text{ (i.e., } n = 52m pm 21 text{);}]here (m = 0, 1, 2, ldots) (and in the formula (n = 52m - 21) we must have (m > 0)).Clearly, the smallest (n) that satisfies the conditions of the problem is (n = 12)."},{"problem":"7-0.

We need to find all positive integers ( b ) such that there exist positive integers ( a, k, l ) with ( k neq l ) and both ( a^k + b^l ) and ( a^l + b^k ) are divisible by ( b^{k+l} ).2. Consider the ( p )-adic valuation ( nu_p ) for a prime ( p ). Recall that for any integers ( x ) and ( y ), if ( nu_p(x) neq nu_p(y) ), then ( nu_p(x+y) = min(nu_p(x), nu_p(y)) ).3. Suppose ( b ) has the desired property and let ( p ) be a prime divisor of ( b ). We analyze the ( p )-adic valuations of the terms involved.4. If ( nu_p(a^k) = k nu_p(a) ) and ( nu_p(b^l) = l nu_p(b) ), then for ( a^k + b^l ) to be divisible by ( b^{k+l} ), we need:   [   nu_p(a^k + b^l) geq (k+l) nu_p(b)   ]5.

We define the centre of a unit square as the intersection of its diagonals.Find the smallest integer m such that, choosing any m unit squares in the grid, we always get four unit squares among them whose centres are vertices of a parallelogram.","solution":"1. Initial Assumption and Counterexample for ( m = 2n - 1 ):   - We need to show that ( m = 2n - 1 ) is not sufficient. Consider choosing all the unit squares in the first row and one additional square from the diagonal. This results in ( 2n - 1 ) squares.   - The centers of these squares lie on two lines: the first row and the diagonal. Since these lines are not parallel, no four centers can form a parallelogram. Hence, ( m = 2n - 1 ) is not sufficient.2. Using the Pigeonhole Principle for ( m = 2n ):   - We will show that ( m = 2n ) is sufficient using the pigeonhole principle.   - Place the grid in a coordinate plane such that the center of the bottom-left square is at ((0,0)) and each square has a side length of 1.   - The center of a square at position ((i, j)) in the grid has coordinates ((i + 0.5, j + 0.5)).3. Counting Vectors:   - Consider the vectors formed by the centers of any two chosen squares. The vector between the centers of squares at ((i_1, j_1)) and ((i_2, j_2)) is:     [     vec{v} = ((i_2 + 0.5) - (i_1 + 0.5), (j_2 + 0.5) - (j_1 + 0.5)) = (i_2 - i_1, j_2 - j_1)     ]   - The coefficients (i_2 - i_1) and (j_2 - j_1) can each range from (-(n-1)) to (n-1), giving (2n - 1) possible values for each coefficient.   - Therefore, there are ((2n - 1)^2) possible distinct vectors.4. Applying the Pigeonhole Principle:   - If we choose (2n) points, the number of vectors formed by these points is:     [     binom{2n}{2} = frac{2n(2n-1)}{2} = 2n^2 - n     ]   - By the pigeonhole principle, since (2n^2 - n > (2n - 1)^2) for (n geq 2), there must be at least one vector that is repeated.5. Ensuring Non-Collinearity:   - The repeated vector implies that there are at least two pairs of points with the same vector difference, meaning they form a parallelogram.   - Since the number of vectors defined by (2n) points is greater than the number of distinct vectors, there must be at least one set of four points forming a parallelogram.Conclusion:Thus, the smallest integer ( m ) such that any ( m ) unit squares in the grid always contain four unit squares whose centers form a parallelogram is ( m = 2n ).The final answer is ( boxed{2n} )."},{"problem":"3.

Let A_{n} be the number of contacts of n spheres arranged in a triangle with n spheres on each side (right figure). Note that the total number of spheres is, obviously, T_{n}=frac{n(n+1)}{2}.We can proceed by induction. If there are n=2 rows, the number of contacts is 3; that is, A_{2}=3. Observe that this coincides with the number of balls in the triangle of two![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_26_38f424f86a89b780358fg-2.jpg?height=400&width=437&top_left_y=879&top_left_x=1392)rows.In a triangle of n-1 rows, there are A_{n-1} contacts. Obviously, in a triangle of n rows, there will be the contacts that were already in a triangle of n-1 rows, plus those that come from adding the last row, as indicated in the figure above. But it is clear that, by adding this last row, contacts of two types are produced:- The ones between the balls of the n-th row, which are n-1.- The ones between the balls of the n-th row and the previous one. They are 2(n-1).Thus, A_{n}=A_{n-1}+3(n-1), or, A_{n}-A_{n-1}=3(n-1). Summing up, we getA_{n}=3((n-1)+(n-2)+cdots+2+1)=3 frac{n(n-1)}{2}=3 T_{n-1}## The problem in three-dimensional space.Now we can analyze the case in three-dimensional space. Let C_{n} be the number of contacts in a tetrahedral pile of spheres with edges of n spheres. In the figure on the right, we have represented the spheres of the base in solid lines and those of the immediate upper floor in dashed lines, from a bird's-eye view.

(See the figure.) In total, then, the number of contacts is C_{n}-C_{n-1}=A_{n}+3 T_{n-1}=3 n(n-1). If we sum up, we getC_{n}-C_{2}=3 n(n-1)+cdots+3 cdot 3(3-1)=3left(n^{2}+cdots+3^{2}right)-3(n+cdots+3)orC_{n}=3left(n^{2}+cdots+2^{2}+1^{2}right)-3(n+cdots+2+1)=3 frac{n(n+1)(2 n+1)}{6}-3 frac{n(n+1)}{2}=n^{3}-n.Another approach. The recurrence C_{n}=C_{n-1}+3 n(n-1) can be solved by writing C_{n} as a cubic polynomial and calculating its coefficients from the recurrence and the initial condition C_{1}=0.If we put C_{n}=a n(n-1)(n-2)+b n(n-1)+c n+d, the recurrence condition gives a=1, b=3, c=0, and the condition C_{1}=0 gives d=0.

On simplification, B becomes left(0, frac{-2y_0^2 - 3}{2y_0}right).Therefore, |OB| = left|frac{-2y_0^2 - 3}{2y_0}right| = |y_0| + frac{3}{2|y_0|} geq 2sqrt{|y_0| cdot frac{3}{2|y_0|}} = sqrt{6}.This inequality holds as an equality if and only if |y_0| = frac{3}{2|y_0|} implies y_0 = pmfrac{sqrt{6}}{2} which is within the interval [-sqrt{2}, sqrt{2}].Thus, the minimum value of |OB| is  boxed{sqrt{6}} ."},{"problem":"Problem 3.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the sum ( a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_{p-1} ), where ( a_k ) is the number of divisors of ( kp + 1 ) that lie strictly between ( k ) and ( p ).2. Analyzing the Divisors:   For each ( k ) in the range ( 1 le k le p-1 ), consider the number ( kp + 1 ). We need to count the divisors of ( kp + 1 ) that are strictly between ( k ) and ( p ).3. Claim:   For a fixed ( m ) (where ( 1 < m < p )), ( m ) contributes exactly once to one of ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{m-1} ).4. Proof of the Claim:   Consider the numbers ( p+1, 2p+1, ldots, (m-1)p+1 ). We need to show that ( m ) divides exactly one of these numbers.   - Since ( gcd(m, p) = 1 ) (because ( p ) is a prime and ( m < p )), ( m ) does not divide ( p ).   - Therefore, ( m ) must divide ( kp + 1 ) for some ( k ) in the range ( 1 le k le m-1 ).   To see why, consider the congruences:   [   p+1 equiv 1 pmod{m}, quad 2p+1 equiv 2 pmod{m}, quad ldots, quad (m-1)p+1 equiv m-1 pmod{m}   ]   Since ( gcd(m, p) = 1 ), the numbers ( p, 2p, ldots, (m-1)p ) form a complete residue system modulo ( m ). Thus, ( kp + 1 ) will be congruent to ( 1, 2, ldots, m-1 ) modulo ( m ), respectively.   Therefore, ( m ) will divide exactly one of these numbers ( kp + 1 ) for ( k ) in the range ( 1 le k le m-1 ).5. Summing Up Contributions:   Each ( m ) (where ( 1 < m < p )) contributes exactly once to one of ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{m-1} ). Since there are ( p-2 ) such ( m ) (from ( 2 ) to ( p-1 )), the total sum ( a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_{p-1} ) is ( p-2 ).The final answer is (boxed{p-2})."},{"problem":"Factorize: (x^{2}+9)^{2}-36x^{2}=____.","solution":"To factorize the given expression (x^{2}+9)^{2}-36x^{2}, we can follow these steps:1.

Let the sum of all digits in odd positions have a remainder s when divided by 10, and the sum of all digits in even positions have a remainder t when divided by 10 (positions are numbered from left to right by numbers from 0 to 100). Let p=10 s+t. Let the assistant cover the digits in positions p and p+1. Seeing which digits are covered, the magician will determine p, and consequently, determine s and t. Note that one covered digit is in an odd position, and the other is in an even position. Thus, by calculating the sum of the open digits in odd positions and knowing s, the magician will determine the covered digit in the odd position. Similarly, the covered digit in the even position is determined.## AnswerFor N=101."},{"problem":"In the expansion of (x^{3}+1)(x-2)^{4}, the coefficient of x^{3} is ______.","solution":"To find the coefficient of x^{3} in the expansion of (x^{3}+1)(x-2)^{4}, we first need to understand the expansion of (x-2)^{4}.

Constant Function Case:   - It is easy to check that a constant function ( f(x) = c ) for some integer ( c ) works.

Non-Constant Function Case:   - We will prove that no non-constant function ( f ) satisfies the problem's condition. Let ( f ) be any non-constant function. We will construct a surjective function ( g: mathbb{Z} to mathbb{Z} ) such that ( f + g ) is not surjective.3. Existence of Distinct Values:   - Since ( f ) is non-constant, there exist distinct ( a, b in mathbb{Z} ) such that ( a neq b ) and ( a, b in R_f ) (the range of ( f )).4.

Case 1: ( T_a cup T_b ) is Infinite:   - Assume ( T_a cup T_b ) is an infinite set. So at least one of ( T_a ) or ( T_b ) is infinite.   - For any ( x in T_a cup T_b ), there are at most 2 integers ( m_x, n_x ) in ( T_a cup T_b ) such that ( f(x) + m_x = a ) or ( b ) and ( f(x) + n_x = a ) or ( b ).   - Construct ( g ) such that ( g(T_a cup T_b) = T_a cup T_b ) and ( f(x) neq m_x, n_x ) in ( T_a cup T_b ). This is possible since ( T_a cup T_b ) is a countable infinite set. Also, set ( g(x) = x ) outside ( T_a cup T_b ).   - Observe that ( f(x) + g(x) neq a, b ) for all ( x in mathbb{Z} ). But ( g ) is surjective by construction.6. Case 2: ( T_a cup T_b ) is Finite and ( |T_a cup T_b| geq 3 ):   - Assume both ( T_a ) and ( T_b ) are finite and ( |T_a cup T_b| geq 3 ).   - Construct ( g(x) = x ) outside ( T_a cup T_b ) and ( g(T_a cup T_b) = T_a cup T_b ) so that ( g(x) + f(x) neq a ).   - For any ( x in T_a cup T_b ), there is at most one ( m_x in T_a cup T_b ) such that ( f(x) + m_x = a ).

( g ) is surjective but ( a notin R_{f+g} ).7. Case 3: ( |T_a cup T_b| = 2 ):   - Assume ( |T_a cup T_b| = 2 ). If we can find any other distinct ( m, n in R_f ) such that ( |T_m cup T_n| geq 3 ), then we will start our work with this ( T_m, T_n ) and proceed like previous cases.   - Otherwise, for all ( m neq n in R_f ), respective ( T_m, T_n ) are singleton sets. So ( T_m = { r_m } ) and ( T_n = { r_n } ). So ( f(r_m) = m - r_m ) and ( f(r_n) = n - r_n ).   - If we can find ( m, n in R_f ) such that ( m - r_m neq n - r_n ), then take ( g(x) = x ) for all ( x in mathbb{Z} - (T_m cup T_n) ) and ( g(r_m) = r_n ), ( g(r_n) = r_m ). Then:     [     f(r_m) + g(r_m) = m - r_m + r_n neq n, quad f(r_n) + g(r_n) = n - r_n + r_m neq n     ]     So ( n notin R_{f+g} ).   - Otherwise, assume that for any distinct ( m, n in R_f ), ( m - r_m = n - r_n ). Fix any ( m neq n in R_f ). Let there be ( c neq r_m, r_n ) such that ( f(c) neq f(r_m) ). Then take ( g(c) = r_m ), ( g(r_m) = c ), and ( g(x) = x ) for any other ( x ). Then:     [     f(c) + g(c) = f(c) + r_m neq f(r_m) + r_m = m     ]     [     f(r_m) + g(r_m) = m - r_m + c neq m     ]     And ( f(x) + g(x) = f(x) + x = m ) cannot hold outside ( T_m ).   - Finally, assume no such ( c ) exists. Then ( f(x) = f(m) ) for all ( x neq r_m, r_n ). So at most 2 numbers are in the range of ( f ), with ( f(x) = f(m) ) for all ( x neq r_m, r_n ) and ( f(r_m) = f(r_n) = m - r_m = n - r_n ).

How many different sequences of 8 commands exist that return the robot to the initial position?","solution":"Solution. For brevity, let's denote the command to move left as L, right as R, up as U, and down as D. For the robot to return to its initial position, it is necessary and sufficient that the number of L commands equals the number of R commands, and the number of U commands equals the number of D commands. Let k be the number of L commands in the sequence. We will count the number N_{k} of the desired sequences for k from 0 to 4.- boldsymbol{k}=mathbf{0}. The sequence consists only of U and D commands. Since their numbers are equal, on 4 out of 8 positions there should be a U, and on the remaining positions, a D. The number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 8 is C_{8}^{4}. Therefore, N_{0}=C_{8}^{4}=70;- boldsymbol{k}=mathbf{1}. The sequence consists of one L command, one R command, and three U and three D commands. The number of ways to place the two commands L and R on 8 positions is C_{8}^{2} cdot C_{2}^{1}: C_{8}^{2} is the number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 8, and C_{2}^{1}=2 is the number of ways to place the commands L and R on these two positions. On the remaining 6 positions, 3 U commands can be placed in C_{6}^{3} ways. Therefore, N_{1}=C_{8}^{2} cdot C_{2}^{1} cdot C_{6}^{3}=1120;- boldsymbol{k}=mathbf{2}. Here, there are two L commands, two R commands, and two U and two D commands. For L and R, there are C_{8}^{4} cdot C_{4}^{2} ways to place them. On the remaining 4 positions, 2 U commands can be placed in C_{4}^{2} ways. Thus, N_{2}=C_{8}^{4} cdot C_{4}^{2} cdot C_{4}^{2}=2520.By reasoning similarly, it can be shown that N_{3}=N_{1} and N_{4}=N_{0}. Therefore, the desired number of sequences is 2 cdotleft(N_{0}+N_{1}right)+N_{2}=4900.Answer: 4900."},{"problem":"In triangle ABC, angle A=frac{pi}{3}, side AB=2, and the area of triangle ABC is frac{sqrt{3}}{2}.

Placement Strategy:   - If a skew knight is placed on a black square, it attacks all the gray squares.   - Therefore, if we place knights only on black squares, they will not attack each other because they only attack gray squares.4. Maximizing the Number of Knights:   - Since there are 32 black squares on the chessboard, we can place one knight on each black square.   - This ensures that no two knights attack each other, as they are all on black squares and only attack gray squares.5.

The probability that 10 minutes pass without either baby crying can be expressed as frac{p}{q}. Compute p+q.[i]2022 CCA Math Bonanza Team Round #7[/i]","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   - We have two babies, each starting in the \\"okay\\" state.   - Each minute, one baby randomly receives a candy.   - The babies' moods can change from \\"upset\\" to \\"delighted\\" in the order: \\"upset,\\" \\"sad,\\" \\"okay,\\" \\"happy,\\" \\"delighted.\\"   - A baby will cry if they are \\"upset\\" and do not receive a candy.   - We need to find the probability that neither baby cries in 10 minutes.2. Modeling the Problem:   - Let ( x ) and ( y ) represent the number of candies received by Baby 1 and Baby 2, respectively.   - The babies start at the \\"okay\\" state, which we can consider as the origin ((0,0)).   - Each minute, one of the babies receives a candy, so after 10 minutes, ( x + y = 10 ).3. Constraints:   - A baby will cry if they are \\"upset\\" and do not receive a candy. This happens if the difference in the number of candies received by the two babies is 3 or more.   - Therefore, we need to ensure that (|x - y| < 3).4. Counting Valid Paths:   - We need to count the number of valid paths from ((0,0)) to ((x,y)) such that ( x + y = 10 ) and (|x - y| < 3).   - This can be visualized as a path on a grid where we avoid crossing the lines ( y = x + 3 ) and ( y = x - 3 ).5. Using Recursion:   - We can use recursion to count the number of valid paths. Let ( f(n, k) ) be the number of valid paths from ((0,0)) to ((n,k)) such that (|n - k| < 3).   - The total number of paths from ((0,0)) to ((10,0)), ((9,1)), and ((8,2)) without crossing the forbidden lines can be computed using dynamic programming or combinatorial methods.6. Total Number of Paths:   - The total number of paths from ((0,0)) to ((10,0)), ((9,1)), and ((8,2)) is given by:     [     f(10,0) + f(9,1) + f(8,2) = 81 + 162 + 81 = 324     ]7. Probability Calculation:   - The total number of possible paths in 10 minutes is ( 2^{10} = 1024 ).   - The probability that neither baby cries is:     [     frac{324}{1024} = frac{81}{256}     ]8. Final Calculation:   - The fraction (frac{81}{256}) is already in its simplest form.   - Therefore, ( p = 81 ) and ( q = 256 ).   - The final answer is ( p + q = 81 + 256 = 337 ).The final answer is ( boxed{337} )"},{"problem":"Given set A={0,2}, which of the following relations is incorrect?A: 0∈AB: {2}∈AC: ∅⊆AD: {0,2}⊆A","solution":"Given the set A = {0, 2}, we need to evaluate each of the given relations to determine which one is incorrect.- For option A: 0 in A is stating that 0 is an element of set A.

(10 points) During the Spring Festival promotion, customers receive a 50 yuan voucher for every 100 yuan paid in cash. These vouchers cannot be exchanged for cash but can be used to purchase goods, with the following rules: vouchers received in a single purchase cannot be used in the same purchase; the cash paid for each purchase must be at least half the value of the goods purchased. Aunt Li has no more than 1550 yuan in cash. Can she buy goods worth 2300 yuan? If yes, design a shopping plan for her; if not, explain the reason.","solution":"【Analysis】First, let's see how many coupons 1550 can get at most, which is 1500 div 2=750. And 2300=1550+750 is exactly right, meaning that 1550 cash must be used together with all the 750 coupons to buy goods worth 2300. How can we use both the coupons and cash together? By considering the last purchase, we can easily draw a conclusion. After analysis, if the last purchase is 100 or more than 150, it is impossible to buy goods worth 2300, because the coupons obtained later cannot be used alone, and the problem requires that coupons must be used together with cash. Therefore, to buy goods worth 2300, the last purchase must be 50 cash + 50 coupons (why 50 coupons, not 100 coupons, is also required by the problem, as the cash must not be less than half of the value of the goods). From 50 coupons, we can infer that the previous purchase's cash was 100, and the coupons used together must also be 100. Thus, the reasoning goes as follows:50+50 (coupons)100+100 (coupons)200+200 (coupons)400+400 (coupons)800On the left is cash 800+400+200+100+50=1550 yuan, and on the right is coupons 400+200+100+50=750 yuan. This way, the value of the goods that can be bought is 1550+750=2300 yuan, so it is possible to buy. According to this, we can solve the problem.【Solution】According to the problem:(1) Since the coupons obtained from the last purchase cannot be used, as 1500 yuan is needed to get 750 yuan worth of coupons, the last purchase can use at most 50 yuan in cash;(2) To use as many coupons as possible, try to use half of the coupons each time, and the coupons used each time are obtained from the previous purchase;(3) The first purchase can only use cash.Thus, the last purchase uses 50 yuan in cash and 50 yuan in coupons;The second-to-last purchase uses 100 yuan in cash and 100 yuan in coupons;The third-to-last purchase uses 200 yuan in cash and 200 yuan in coupons;The fourth-to-last purchase uses 400 yuan in cash and 400 yuan in coupons;The fifth-to-last purchase uses 800 yuan in cash.The solution that meets the conditions is:The first purchase uses 800 yuan in cash;The second purchase uses 400 yuan in cash and 400 yuan in coupons;The third purchase uses 200 yuan in cash and 200 yuan in coupons;The fourth purchase uses 100 yuan in cash and 100 yuan in coupons;The fifth purchase uses 50 yuan in cash and 50 yuan in coupons.In total: 800+400+400+200+200+100+100+50+50=2300 (yuan)Therefore, with no more than 1550 yuan in cash, she can buy goods worth 2300 yuan."},{"problem":"At the Mountain School, Micchell is assigned a [i]submissiveness rating[/i] of 3.0 or 4.0 for each class he takes.

From T_1 + frac{1}{2}b_1 = 1, we get b_1 = frac{2}{3}.For n geq 2, since T_n = 1 - frac{1}{2}b_n and T_{n-1} = 1 - frac{1}{2}b_{n-1},T_n - T_{n-1} = frac{1}{2}(b_{n-1} - b_n),which impliesb_n = frac{1}{2}b_{n-1} - T_n + T_{n-1}.Therefore,b_n = frac{1}{3}b_{n-1}.Hence, {b_n} is a geometric sequence with the first term frac{2}{3} and the common ratio frac{1}{3}.(3) According to (2), we have:b_n = frac{2}{3} left( frac{1}{3} right)^{n-1} = 2 left( frac{1}{3} right)^n.Thus,c_n = a_n cdot b_n = (4n - 2) cdot 2 left( frac{1}{3} right)^n = (8n - 4) left( frac{1}{3} right)^n.The sum of the first n terms of {c_n}:S_n = c_1 + c_2 + ldots + c_{n-1} + c_n = 4 left( frac{1}{3} right) + 12 left( frac{1}{3} right)^2 + ldots + (8n - 12) left( frac{1}{3} right)^{n-1} + (8n - 4) left( frac{1}{3} right)^n.Multiplying both sides by frac{1}{3}, we obtain the following equation:frac{1}{3}S_n = 4 left( frac{1}{3} right)^2 + 12 left( frac{1}{3} right)^3 + ldots + (8n - 12) left( frac{1}{3} right)^n + (8n - 4) left( frac{1}{3} right)^{n+1}.Subtracting this from the original sum S_n, we get:frac{2}{3}S_n = 4 left( frac{1}{3} right) + 8 left( frac{1}{3} right)^2 + ldots + 8 left( frac{1}{3} right)^{n} - (8n - 4) left( frac{1}{3} right)^{n+1}.We can recognize this as a geometric series and calculate:S_n = frac{4}{3} + 8 frac{ left( frac{1}{3} right)^2 left[ 1 - left( frac{1}{3} right)^{n-1} right]}{1 - frac{1}{3}} - (8n - 4) left( frac{1}{3} right)^{n+1}.Simplify this to obtain:S_n = frac{4}{3} left( 1 - left( frac{1}{3} right)^n right) - 4 left( frac{1}{3} right)^{n} - (8n - 4) left( frac{1}{3} right)^{n+1}.Finally, after combining like terms:boxed{S_n = 4 - 4(n + 1) left( frac{1}{3} right)^n}."},{"problem":"Given that f(x+1) = 3x+2, the analytical expression of f(x) is:A: 3x-1B: 3x+1C: 3x+2D: 3x+4","solution":"To find the analytical expression of f(x) given that f(x+1) = 3x+2, we can work with the given equation and manipulate it to express f(x) in terms of x.Given: f(x+1) = 3x+2We know that we can express 3x+2 in a form that relates closely to f(x+1). To do this, we observe that the 3x+2 can be rewritten as:[3x+2 = 3(x+1) - 1]This rewriting helps because it directly involves x+1, which is the argument of f in f(x+1). Since we know that f(x+1) is essentially f applied to (x+1), we can deduce the general form of f(x) by substituting x with x+1 in the original equation.

In the second case, fixing the smaller triangle and using the fact that the vertices of the larger will trace arcs of circles, a purely geometric solution can be obtained; an even simpler analytical solution is as follows: if the projections of the leg of the smaller triangle onto the legs of the larger are x and y (Fig. 111), then x^{2}+y^{2}=a^{2}, and the leg of the larger is 2 x+y leqslant leqslant a sqrt{5}."},{"problem":"Calculate lim_{Delta x to 0} frac {sinleft( frac {pi}{6}+Delta xright)-sin frac {pi}{6}}{Delta x} = (　　)A:  frac {1}{2}B:  frac { sqrt {3}}{2}C: -frac {1}{2}D: -frac { sqrt {3}}{2}","solution":"Let f(x) = sin x, then f'(x) = cos x.Therefore, lim_{Delta x to 0} frac {sinleft( frac {pi}{6}+Delta xright)-sin frac {pi}{6}}{Delta x} = cos frac {pi}{6} = frac { sqrt {3}}{2}.Hence, the correct option is boxed{B}.This problem can be solved by using the definition of the derivative.

For any point M in space, it's possible to construct a plane that contains both a and b. In this plane, or through these lines, there exists exactly one line c that can be drawn through M to be perpendicular to both a and b.

Based on the daily average reading time of these n students, the sample data is grouped as follows: left[0,20right), left[20,40right), left[40,60right), left[60,80right), left[80,100right), left[100,120right], and the frequency distribution table is shown below:| Group         | Frequency | Frequency Rate ||---------------|-----------|----------------|| left[0,20right)   | 4       | f_{1}         || left[20,40right)  | 10      | 0.1           || left[40,60right)  | 46      | f_{2}         || left[60,80right)  | a       | f_{3}         || left[80,100right) | 20      | f_{4}         || left[100,120right]| 4       | f_{5}         |(1) Find the values of n and f_{3};  (2) If a stratified random sampling method is used to select 10 students from those with daily average reading times in the ranges left[60,80right), left[80,100right), left[100,120right], and then one student is randomly selected from the 10 students for a reading experience sharing, find the probability that the student selected for the reading experience sharing has a daily average reading time of at least 80 minutes;  (3) Now, select the 10 students with the longest daily average reading times from these n students as \\"Reading Masters.\\" Calculate the minimum daily average reading time required to become a \\"Reading Master.\\"","solution":" Solution# Part 1: Finding n and f_3- Given that the frequency of data in the range left[20,40right) is 10 with a frequency rate of 0.1, we can establish the equation for n as follows:frac{10}{n} = 0.1 Rightarrow n = frac{10}{0.1} Rightarrow n = 100.- With n=100, we can sum up the frequencies to find a:4 + 10 + 46 + a + 20 + 4 = 100 Rightarrow 84 + a = 100 Rightarrow a = 100 - 84 Rightarrow a = 16.- Therefore, the frequency rate for the group left[60,80right), which is f_3, can be calculated as:f_3 = frac{16}{100} = 0.16.Thus, n=100 and f_3=0.16, encapsulated as n = boxed{100} and f_3 = boxed{0.16}.# Part 2: Probability of Selecting a Student for Reading Experience Sharing- The proportions of students in the specified ranges are 16:20:4, which simplifies to 4:5:1.- When selecting 10 students using stratified random sampling from these proportions, the number of students selected from each range can be found by maintaining their ratio. Hence, the students with at least 80 minutes of reading time (from the left[80,100right) and left[100,120right] groups) total 5 + 1 = 6 out of 10.- Therefore, the probability of selecting a student with a daily average reading time of at least 80 minutes is:frac{6}{10} = 0.6.Thus, the probability is boxed{0.6}.# Part 3: Minimum Daily Average Reading Time for a \\"Reading Master\\"- From the total of n=100 students, 4 have reading times in left[100,120right]. To identify the \\"Reading Masters,\\" we focus on the top 10 students, which includes these 4 students.- The remaining 6 \\"Reading Masters\\" must be found from the left[80,100right) range.- Let x represent the minimum reading time among these 6 students. The ratio of the difference between 100 and x to the total range (100-80) should equal the proportion of these 6 students out of the total 20 in this range. This gives us:frac{100-x}{100-80} = frac{6}{20} Rightarrow 100 - x = frac{6}{20} cdot 20 Rightarrow 100 - x = 6 cdot 1 Rightarrow x = 100 - 6 Rightarrow x = 94.Therefore, the minimum daily average reading time required to become a \\"Reading Master\\" is boxed{94} minutes."},{"problem":"25.

This leads us to two simultaneous equations:1. x + y - 3 = 02.

This quadratic equation has only one root, hence its discriminant is 0. This leads to a quadratic equation in k, where k_1 and k_2 must be its two roots.

Solution. Consider a rectangular coordinate system in space with the origin at point S and coordinate axes along the edges O A, O B and O C. The center of the circumscribed sphere can be found in different ways. One way is direct: if we write the equality of the squares of the distances for the desired center O(x, y, z) as O A^{2}=O B^{2}=O C^{2}=O S^{2} cdot By subtracting the obtained equations, we will have linear equations from which it is easy to find x, y, z. Another way is to notice that the center of the sphere should project onto the plane of triangle A B S at the center of the circumscribed circle of this triangle, i.e., at the midpoint of the hypotenuse A B - the point left(1 ; frac{3}{2} ; 0right), and thus the coordinates of the center of the sphere have the form left(1 ; frac{3}{2} ; zright). Similarly, considering triangle A C S, we get that the coordinate z should be equal to half the value of z_{C}, i.e., equal to 3. As a result, R=sqrt{1^{2}+left(frac{3}{2}right)^{2}+3^{2}}=frac{7}{2}. The third way is as follows: note that for a rectangular parallelepiped with sides S A, S B and S C, its center is equidistant from all vertices of the parallelepiped and, in particular, from A, B, C and S. Therefore, the radius R is half the diagonal of the parallelepiped: R=frac{1}{2} sqrt{2^{2}+3^{2}+6^{2}}=frac{7}{2}.b) Consider the center O_{1} of the circle circumscribed around triangle A B C. The point O_{1} is the projection of the center O(x, y, z) of the sphere onto the plane A B C. If solving the problem in part a) in coordinates, it is not difficult to find the coordinates of point O_{1} as the projection of point O onto the plane: frac{x}{2}+frac{y}{3}+frac{z}{6}=1 (the equation of the plane A B C) and to verify that the distance from O_{1} to all vertices of the tetrahedron is less than R. But we can do without detailed calculations. Indeed, first note that points S and O lie on opposite sides of the plane A B C (this follows, for example, from part a), see the second method for finding the center O). Further, the distances O_{1} A=O_{1} B=O_{1} C are strictly less than R, since R is the length of the hypotenuse in the corresponding right triangles O O_{1} A, O O_{1} B, O O_{1} C. The distance O_{1} S<O S=R, since triangle S O O_{1} is obtuse with the obtuse angle S O_{1} O; this follows from the equality angle O O_{1} M=90^{circ}, where M is the point of intersection of the line S O with the plane A B C. Thus, all distances from O_{1} to the vertices of the tetrahedron are less than R, and therefore the sphere with center O_{1} and radius equal to the minimum of these distances will be the desired one.## 11th grade"},{"problem":"Which of the following polynomials can be factored?A: x+1B: x^{2}+x+1C: x^{2}-1D: x^{2}+4","solution":"To determine which of the given polynomials can be factored, let's examine each option:- Option A: x+1This is a linear polynomial and does not factor further in terms of real numbers or integer coefficients beyond its given form.

Since the angle between the lateral faces is 120^circ and three such face angles are placed side by side, the three pyramids fit together without gaps. The adjacent lateral faces of two pyramids will form an angle of 360^circ - 2 cdot 120^circ = 120^circ. By inserting a new pyramid between each pair of adjacent pyramids so that its vertex coincides with the common vertex of the already assembled pyramids, a closed solid is formed, bounded by 6 squares (the base faces of the 6 pyramids). This solid can only be a cube. The sum of the heights of two pyramids placed with their bases opposite each other is equal to the edge of the cube, or the edge of the pyramid's base.

We claim that any number N can be written as the sum of three positive integers in binom{N-1}{2} ways, considering the order of the addends.To prove this, imagine placing N balls in a row next to each other. The number of ways to write N as the sum of three numbers is exactly the number of ways to divide the N balls into three groups, considering the order of the groups. To divide the N balls into three groups, we need to choose two out of the N-1 imaginary dividing lines between the balls. This can be done in binom{N-1}{2} ways.2007 cannot be written in this form, but a number close to it, 2016, can: 2016=binom{65-1}{2}.We have not yet considered the condition of the problem that 2007 must be divided using numbers between 1 and k.If k=N-1, the number of ways to write it is still binom{N-1}{2}, since we haven't used N so far.This is also true for k=N-2.If k=N-3, we cannot count the case (N-2), 1,1 and its two other permutations.If k=N-4, in addition to the previous cases, we cannot use the case (N-3), 2,1, which has a total of 6 permutations.Therefore, for k=N-4, the total number of cases is: binom{N-1}{2}-3-6=binom{N-1}{2}-9.

Since each of the hunters A and B hits and kills a duck as often as they miss, the probability of killing a duck for each of these hunters with each individual shot is 1 / 2, i.e., the same as the probability of a coin landing heads. Thus, our problem is equivalent to the following: A tosses a coin 50 times, and B tosses it 51 times; what is the probability that heads will appear more times for B than for A? It is not difficult to calculate the number of equally probable outcomes of this experiment; however, calculating the number of favorable outcomes here is relatively complex. We will not perform this calculation, but instead use the following simple artificial reasoning.The set of all outcomes of the experiment, where A tosses a coin 50 times and B tosses it 51 times, can be divided into the following two parts: 1) the set of all outcomes where B gets more heads than A, and 2) the set of all outcomes where B gets no more (i.e., fewer or the same number of) heads than A. Note now that if B gets the same number of heads as A or even fewer, then it means that the tails for B appeared more times than for A, and vice versa, if the tails for B appeared more times than for A, then it means that the heads for B appeared either the same number of times as for A or even fewer (since B tosses the coin one more time than A). Therefore, the set of outcomes where B gets no more heads than A coincides with the set of outcomes where B gets more tails than A. But in the case of complete equality of heads and tails on the coin, the number of outcomes where B gets more heads than A should be equal to the number of outcomes where B gets more tails than A. Thus, in our problem, the number of favorable outcomes of the experiment is equal to the number of unfavorable outcomes, from which it immediately follows that the desired probability is 1 / 2.Therefore, the probability that B's catch will exceed A's catch is 1 / 2.Note. The provided solution remains valid in the case where A encounters n ducks during the hunt, and B encounters n+1 ducks. And in this more general case, the probability that B's catch will exceed A's catch is also 1 / 2."},{"problem":"Given the function f(x)=Asin (2x+varphi )-frac{1}{2}(A > 0,0 < varphi < frac{pi}{2}) whose graph intercepts the y-axis at 1, and is symmetric about the line x=frac{pi}{12}.

Since sum of 2 multiples of 3 = multiple of 3, so we must have 2y=6.Therefore, y=3, and it follows that z=2. Now, x=12-y-z=12-3-2=boxed{textbf{(D)}~7}, as desired.Solution 2Since the total cost of the socks was 24 and Ralph bought 12 pairs, the average cost of each pair of socks is frac{24}{12} = 2.There are two ways to make packages of socks that average to 2. You can have:bullet Two 1 pairs and one 4 pair (package adds up to 6)bullet One 1 pair and one 3 pair (package adds up to 4)Now, we need to solve[6a+4b=24,]where a is the number of 6 packages and b is the number of 4 packages. We see our only solution (that has at least one of each pair of sock) is a=2, b=3, which yields the answer of 2times2+3times1 = boxed{textbf{(D)}~7}.Solution 3Since there are 12 pairs of socks, and Ralph bought at least one pair of each, there are 12-3=9 pairs of socks left. Also, the sum of the three pairs of socks is 1+3+4=8. This means that there are 24-8=16 dollars left. If there are only 1 dollar socks left, then we would have 9cdot1=9 dollars wasted, which leaves 7 more dollars. If we replace one pair with a 3 dollar pair, then we would waste an additional 2 dollars. If we replace one pair with a 4 dollar pair, then we would waste an additional 3 dollars. The only way 7 can be represented as a sum of 2s and 3s is 2+2+3. If we change 3 pairs, we would have 6 pairs left. Adding the one pair from previously, we have boxed{(text{D})~7} pairs.Solution 4Let the amount of 1 dollar socks be a, 3 dollar socks be b, and 4 dollar socks be c. We then know that a+b+c=12 and a+3b+4c=24. We can make a+b+c=12 into a=12-b-c and then plug that into the other equation, producing 12-b-c+3b+4c=24 which simplifies to 2b+3c=12. It's not hard to see b=3 and c=2. Now that we know b and c, we know that a=7, meaning the number of 1 dollar socks Ralph bought is boxed{textbf{(D)} 7}.Solution 5 (Guess and check)If Ralph bought one sock of each kind, he already used 8, so there are 16 left and 9 socks. If we split the 16 into four 4 sections, (as it is the smallest possible number that 1, 3, 4, can make in different ways that in all use at least each of the numbers once,) if Ralph bought a 3 pair, he would need to buy a 1 pair in order for it to add up to a multiple of four. Similarly, if Ralph bought a 1 pair, he would either need to buy three 1 pairs or a 3 pair. If Ralph bought a 4 pair, it would already make a group. Now, the problem is just how we can split 9 into 4 groups of 1, 2, or 4. We clearly see that 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 9, or a 4 pair, two 3 pairs, and six 1 pairs. Because we subtracted the necessary one of each kind, there are two 4 pairs, three 3 pairs, and seven 1 pairs. Therefore, the number of 1 pairs Ralph bought is boxed{textbf{(D)}~7}.~strongstephen"},{"problem":"12.

Considering the total score is a multiple of 3, the possible total scores are 30, 27, 24. We will discuss each case separately:(1) Total score 30 points:In this case, there are no draws, so the scores of the top four teams can only be 9, 6, 3 points. It is impossible to sum up to 30 with only two repetitions. Therefore, the total score of 30 points does not exist.(2) Total score 27 points:After testing, it is found to exist, meeting the score requirements of the problem, and the four teams win 7 matches and lose 3 matches, which exactly satisfies the fifth team's 4 losses, so this is one solution, with 3 draws in the matches.(3) Total score 24 points:In the case of 24 points, the top four teams can only each win 1 match and draw 2 matches, but this does not satisfy only two teams having the same score. Therefore, the total score of 24 points does not exist.In summary, the only existing case is when the total score is 27 points, with a total of 3 draws in the matches."},{"problem":"Given a moving point M whose distance to a fixed point F(1,0) is less than its distance to the fixed line x=-2 by 1.(Ⅰ) Find the equation of the trajectory of point M;(Ⅱ) Draw any two perpendicular lines through point F, denoted as l_{1} and l_{2}, intersecting curve C at points A, B and M, N, respectively.

Evaluate for Suitable x:  Given the choices -2, 0, and 2, we need to find a suitable x that does not make the denominator zero in the original expression. Since x-2 neq 0, x neq 2.

The intersection of this line with the x-axis is the optimal location for P.First, we find the slope of line M'N where M' is the reflection of M with coordinates (-1,-3). text{Slope of } M'N = frac{1 - (-3)}{2 - (-1)} = frac{4}{3} Using the slope and the point N(2,1), we write the equation of line M'N: y - 1 = frac{4}{3}(x - 2)  3y - 3 = 4x - 8  4x - 3y = 5 Since point P lies on the x-axis, its y-coordinate is 0. We substitute y = 0 into the equation to find the x-coordinate of P: 4x - 3(0) = 5  4x = 5  x = frac{5}{4} Therefore, point P has coordinates left(frac{5}{4}, 0right).Now, we need to calculate PM+PN. Since point P lies on the x-axis, we can calculate PM and PN as the distance from P to each point using the distance formula. Since M' and P are reflections of M and P over the x-axis, the distance from M to P is the same as from M' to P. So we calculate PM as M'P for simplicity: M'P = sqrt{(frac{5}{4} - (-1))^2 + (0 - (-3))^2}  M'P = sqrt{(frac{9}{4})^2 + 3^2}  M'P = sqrt{frac{81}{16} + frac{144}{16}}  M'P = sqrt{frac{225}{16}}  M'P = frac{15}{4} And PN: PN = sqrt{(2 - frac{5}{4})^2 + (1 - 0)^2}  PN = sqrt{(frac{3}{4})^2 + 1}  PN = sqrt{frac{9}{16} + frac{16}{16}}  PN = sqrt{frac{25}{16}}  PN = frac{5}{4} Adding these distances together gives us the minimum value of PM+PN: PM + PN = M'P + PN  PM + PN = frac{15}{4} + frac{5}{4}  PM + PN = frac{20}{4}  PM + PN = 5 Therefore, the minimum value is boxed{5}."},{"problem":"Let phi(n) denote the number of positive integers less than or equal to n and relatively prime to n. Find all natural numbers n and primes p such that phi(n)=phi(np).","solution":"1. Let ( n ) be a natural number and ( p ) be a prime such that (phi(n) = phi(np)). Recall that (phi(n)) is the Euler's totient function, which counts the number of positive integers up to ( n ) that are relatively prime to ( n ).2. If ( n = prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{q_i} ) for distinct primes ( p_i ), then the Euler's totient function is given by:   [   phi(n) = n prod_{i=1}^k left(1 - frac{1}{p_i}right)   ]   This can be rewritten as:   [   phi(n) = prod_{i=1}^k (p_i - 1) p_i^{q_i - 1}   ]3. Now, consider ( np ). Since ( p ) is a prime and ( n ) is composed of primes ( p_i ), we have:   [   np = prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{q_i} cdot p   ]   The Euler's totient function for ( np ) is:   [   phi(np) = phi(n) cdot phi(p) = phi(n) cdot (p - 1)   ]4.

Note that (overline{b a b} - overline{a b b} = 90(b - a)) is divisible by this GCD. Divisibility by 2 and 5 is determined by the last digit, which is (b), and it cannot be zero, so the GCD cannot be both even and divisible by 5.(|a - b| leqslant 8), so if the GCD is not divisible by 3, it cannot be greater than (2|a - b| leqslant 16) or (5|a - b| leqslant 40) depending on the case we are considering.Therefore, for the GCD to be greater than 45, it must be divisible by 3, and thus the original numbers must be divisible by 3.For the number (overline{b a b}) to be divisible by 3, the numbers (a) and (b) must give the same remainder when divided by 3. Thus, (|a - b|) can take the values 3 or 6, and consequently, the GCD must be a divisor of the number (540 = 3^3 cdot 2^2 cdot 5), and it still cannot contain both 2 and 5 simultaneously. If we are interested in a GCD greater than 45, it must be divisible by 9, and more specifically, by 27. This means the number (overline{b a b}) must be divisible by 9. When this condition is met, the digit (a) almost uniquely determines the digit (b) according to the divisibility rule for 9.Thus, for (overline{b a b}), it makes sense to consider only the numbers 171, 252, 333, 414, 585, 666, 747, 828, 909, and 999 (some of which do not fit because (a neq b), for example, 999). The remaining numbers form two arithmetic progressions with a common difference of 81 each.

Understanding the Function Behavior: The function f(x) is defined such that f(x-2) = 2f(x). This means when we decrease the input x by 2, the output of the function doubles. 2. Given Range for f(x): For x in (0,2], the function is defined as f(x) = x(2-x). Within this interval, the output of f(x) ranges from 0 to 1 because the maximum value of x(2-x) occurs at x=1, giving f(1)=1.3. Extending the Function Behavior: Given that f(x-2) = 2f(x), we can deduce that for every 2 units decrease in x, the output range of the function quadruples. Therefore, for x in (-4,0], the output range of f(x) would be [0,4].4. Finding x for a Specific Output: We are interested in the condition f(t) geq frac{15}{4}. To find the corresponding x values, we equate x(2-x) to a quarter of frac{15}{4}, which simplifies to solving x(2-x) = frac{15}{16}. This equation simplifies to a quadratic equation.5. Solving the Quadratic Equation: Solving x(2-x) = frac{15}{16}, we get x^2 - 2x + frac{15}{16} = 0. The solutions to this quadratic equation are x = frac{3}{4} or x = frac{5}{4}, by applying the quadratic formula or factoring.6. Determining the Maximum Value of t: Since we are looking for the maximum value of t that satisfies f(t) geq frac{15}{4}, and knowing that f(x) behaves according to the pattern established, we take the larger solution x = frac{5}{4} and adjust it by the pattern we've observed. Since we know f(x-4) in [0,4], we adjust frac{5}{4} by subtracting 4 to find the corresponding t value, which gives t = frac{5}{4} - 4 = -frac{11}{4}.Therefore, the maximum value of t that satisfies f(t) geq frac{15}{4} is boxed{-frac{11}{4}}.

Let y_{n}=2^{x_{n}}-1. Determine the largest possible k such that, for some positive integer a, the numbers y_{1}, ldots, y_{k} are all prime.(Russia) Valery Senderov","solution":"The largest such is k=2. Notice first that if y_{i} is prime, then x_{i} is prime as well. Actually, if x_{i}=1 then y_{i}=1 which is not prime, and if x_{i}=m n for integer m, n>1 then 2^{m}-1 mid 2^{x_{i}}-1=y_{i}, so y_{i} is composite. In particular, if y_{1}, y_{2}, ldots, y_{k} are primes for some k geq 1 then a=x_{1} is also prime.Now we claim that for every odd prime a at least one of the numbers y_{1}, y_{2}, y_{3} is composite (and thus k<3). Indeed, if a equiv 1(bmod 4), then x_{2} equiv 3(bmod 4); consequently, x_{3} equiv 7 (bmod 8). This implies that 2 is a quadratic residue modulo p=x_{3}, so 2 equiv s^{2}(bmod p) for some integer s, and hence 2^{x_{2}}=2^{(p-1) / 2} equiv s^{p-1} equiv 1(bmod p). This means that p mid y_{2}, thus 2^{x_{2}}-1=x_{3}=2 x_{2}+1. But it is easy to show that 2^{t}-1>2 t+1 for all integer t>3. A contradiction.Finally, if a=2, then the numbers y_{1}=3 and y_{2}=31 are primes, while y_{3}=2^{11}-1 is divisible by 23 ; in this case we may choose k=2 but not k=3.Remark.

According to the problem, the fantasizers did not name initial numbers. If an initial number was named by a liar, then neither another liar nor a knight could name it again. But each number was named at least twice. Therefore, initial numbers could only be named by knights, and 33 is the only initial number.

Initial Setup and Assumptions:   We are given a polynomial ( W ) with real coefficients such that if ( x + y ) is rational, then ( W(x) + W(y) ) is rational. We need to find all such polynomials.2. Analyzing the Condition:   Fix a rational number ( q ). Consider the function ( f(x) = W(x) + W(q - x) ). Since ( x + (q - x) = q ) is rational, ( f(x) ) must be rational for all ( x ). 3. Continuity and Constancy:   The function ( f(x) ) is continuous (since ( W ) is a polynomial and hence continuous) and takes only rational values. A continuous function that takes only rational values must be constant. Therefore, ( f(x) = c ) for some constant ( c ).4. Expressing ( W ) in Terms of ( Z ):   We have ( W(x) + W(q - x) = c ). Let ( Z(x) = W(x) - W(0) ). Then:   [   Z(x) + Z(q - x) = W(x) - W(0) + W(q - x) - W(0) = W(x) + W(q - x) - 2W(0) = c - 2W(0)   ]   Let ( k = c - 2W(0) ). Thus, ( Z(x) + Z(q - x) = k ).5. Additivity on Rationals:   If ( x + y ) is rational, then:   [   W(x) + W(y) = W(x + y) + W(0)   ]   Substituting ( Z(x) = W(x) - W(0) ), we get:   [   Z(x) + Z(y) = Z(x + y)   ]   This shows that ( Z ) is additive on the rationals.6. Induction on Rational Multiples:   By induction, we can show that ( Z(nx) = nZ(x) ) for any integer ( n ) and rational ( x ). For rational ( x = frac{m}{n} ):   [   nZleft(frac{m}{n}right) = Z(m) = mZ(1)   ]   Therefore, ( Zleft(frac{m}{n}right) = frac{m}{n}Z(1) ), implying ( Z(q) = qZ(1) ) for all rational ( q ).7. Form of ( W ):   Since ( Z(x) = xZ(1) ) for all rational ( x ), and ( Z(x) = W(x) - W(0) ), we have:   [   W(x) = W(0) + x(W(1) - W(0))   ]   This is a linear polynomial of the form ( W(x) = ax + b ) where ( a = W(1) - W(0) ) and ( b = W(0) ).8. Rational Coefficients:   Since ( W(x) + W(y) ) must be rational whenever ( x + y ) is rational, ( a ) and ( b ) must be rational numbers.Conclusion:The only polynomials ( W ) with the given property are of the form ( W(x) = ax + b ) where ( a ) and ( b ) are rational numbers.The final answer is ( boxed{ W(x) = ax + b } ) where ( a ) and ( b ) are rational numbers."},{"problem":"Problem 4.

We will show that for other lambda values, there is no positive integer solution.Suppose for a certain lambda there is a solution, and consider a solution for which x+y+z+v is minimal. By symmetry, we can assume that x leq y leq z leq v.First, we prove thatv leq frac{lambda x y z}{2} quad text{and} quad v leq sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}Consider (1) as a quadratic equation in v. According to the relationships between roots and coefficients (Vieta's formulas), the other root isv_{1}=lambda x y z - v = frac{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}{v}From the first formula, it is clear that v_{1} is also an integer, and from the second formula, it is clear that v_{1} is positive. This means that (1) also has the solution (x, y, z, v_{1}). Since x+y+z+v is minimal, v leq v_{1}, which implies (2) holds by (3).The following estimate provides an upper bound for lambda:lambda x y z = x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} + v^{2} leq x v + y v + z v + v frac{lambda x y z}{2} leq left(3 + frac{lambda}{2}right) x y z vFrom this, lambda leq 3 + frac{lambda}{2}, or lambda leq 6.If none of x, y, z, v are even, then the left side is divisible by 4, but the right side x y z v is odd, so lambda must be divisible by 4; this is only possible if lambda=4.If one or three of x, y, z, v are even, then the right side is even, but the left side is odd, which is a contradiction.If two of x, y, z, v are even, then the left side gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, but the right side is divisible by 4, which is also a contradiction.Finally, if all of x, y, z, v are even, then the (4) estimate can be refined slightly:lambda x y z v leq x v + y v + z v + v frac{lambda x y z}{2} leq left(frac{3}{4} + frac{lambda}{2}right) x y z v; quad text{from this, } lambda leq frac{3}{4} + frac{lambda}{2}, text{ or } lambda=1Therefore, a positive integer solution is only possible for lambda=1 and lambda=4.Remarks. 1.

Many have rewritten the proof described there for equation (1). Unfortunately, the solution in the book contains several inaccuracies, and some contestants did not correct them. Many, following the book, defined the number v_{1} by the formula v_{1} = lambda x y z - v and verified by substitution that the quadruple (x, y, z, v_{1}) is also a solution to (1).

This implies that at least 7 groups are needed.However, this is sufficient if the numbers n that fall into the group of 2^{k} are such that 2^{k} leqq n<2^{k+1}(0 leqq k leqq 6). The ratio of any two such numbers—when the larger is divided by the smaller—lies between 1 and 2, and thus cannot be an integer.Remarks. 1. The above is not the only possible partition. If the numbers that have exactly i prime factors in their prime factorization are placed in the i-th group, and 1 is placed in a separate group, we will get exactly 7 suitable groups. The smallest product of 7 factors is 2^{7}, which is greater than 100, and a number has fewer prime factors in its proper divisors than in the number itself, so indeed no divisibility can hold among the numbers in the same group.2.

could Brady stack the plates?(A) 5139(B) 5142(C) 5145(D) 5148(E) 5151","solution":"Solution 1Let the number of black plates, gold plates, and red plates be b, g and r, respectively (b, g and r are whole numbers).Brady is stacking 600 plates, and so b+g+r=600, where b is a multiple of 2, mathrm{~g} is a multiple of 3 , and mathrm{r} is a multiple of 6 .Rewrite this equation as g=600-b-r and consider the right side of the equation.Since 600 is a multiple of 2 , and b is a multiple of 2 , and r is a multiple of 2 (any multiple of 6 is a multiple of 2), then 600-b-r is a multiple of 2 (the difference between even numbers is even).Since the right side of the equation is a multiple of 2 , then the left side, g, must also be a multiple of 2 .We are given that g is a multiple of 3 , and since g is also a multiple of 2 , then g must be an even multiple of 3 or a multiple of 6 .Similarly, rewriting the equation as b=600-g-r and considering the right side of the equation: 600 is a multiple of 6 , and g is a multiple of 6 , and r is a multiple of 6 , so then 600-g-r is a multiple of 6 (the difference between multiples of 6 is a multiple of 6 ).Since the right side of the equation is a multiple of 6 , then the left side, b, must also be a multiple of 6 .That is, each of b, g and r is a multiple of 6 , and so we let b=6 B, g=6 G, and r=6 R where B, G and R are whole numbers.So then the equation b+g+r=600 becomes 6 B+6 G+6 R=600, which is equivalent to B+G+R=100 after dividing by 6 .Each solution to the equation B+G+R=100 corresponds to a way that Brady could stack the 600 plates, and every possible way that Brady could stack the 600 plates corresponds to a solution to the equation B+G+R=100.For example, B=30, G=50, R=20 corresponds to b=6 times 30=180, g=6 times 50=300, r=6 times 20=120, which corresponds to Brady stacking 180 black plates, below 300 gold plates, which are below 120 red plates.Since B+G+R=100, then each of B, G and R has a maximum possible value of 100 .If B=100, then G=R=0.If B=99, G+R=100-B=1.Thus, G=0 and R=1 or G=1 and R=0.That is, once we assign values for B and G, then there is no choice for R since it is determined by the equation R=100-B-G.Thus, to determine the number of solutions to the equation B+G+R=100, we must determine the number of possible pairs (B, G) which lead to a solution.For example, above we showed that the three pairs (100,0),(99,0), and (99,1) each correspond to a solution to the equation.Continuing in this way, we determine all possible pairs (B, G) (which give R ) that satisfy B+G+R=100.| Value of B | Value of G | Number of plates: b, g, r || :---: | :---: | :---: || 100 | 0 | 600,0,0 || 99 | 0 | 594,0,6 || 99 | 1 | 594,6,0 || 98 | 0 | 588,0,12 || 98 | 1 | 588,6,6 || 98 | 2 | 588,12,0

12,6(n-2) || vdots | vdots | vdots || 100-n | n | 6(100-n), 6 n, 0 |We see from the table that if the value of B is 100-n for some whole number n leq 100, then G can equal any whole number from 0 to n and so there are n+1 possible choices for G.That is, when B=100, there is 1 choice for G, when B=99, there are 2 choices for G, whenB=98, there are 3 choices for G, and so on.Each additional decrease of 1 in B gives 1 additional choice for G until we arrive at B=0 (n=100), which gives n+1=100+1=101 possible choices for G(0,1,2,3, ldots, 100).Therefore, the total number of solutions to B+G+R=100 is given by the sum 1+2+3+cdots+99+100+101.Using the fact that the sum of the first m positive integers 1+2+3+cdots+m is equal to frac{m(m+1)}{2}, we get 1+2+3+cdots+99+100+101=frac{101(102)}{2}=5151.Since each of these solutions corresponds to a way that Brady could stack the plates, there are 5151 ways that Brady could stack the plates under the given conditions.## Solution 2In a given way of stacking the plates, let b be the number of groups of 2 black plates, g be the number of groups of 3 gold plates, and r be the number of groups of 6 red plates.Then there are 2 b black plates, 3 g gold plates, and 6 r red plates.Since the total number of plates in a stack is 600 , then 2 b+3 g+6 r=600.We note that the numbers of black, gold and red plates completely determines the stack (we cannot rearrange the plates in any way), and so the number of ways of stacking the plates is the same as the number of ways of solving the equation 2 b+3 g+6 r=600 where b, g, r are integers that are greater than or equal to 0 .Since r is at least 0 and 6 r is at most 600 , then the possible values for r are 0,1,2,3, ldots, 98,99,100.When r=0, we obtain 2 b+3 g=600.Since g is at least 0 and 3 g is at most 600 , then g is at most 200 .Since 2 b and 600 are even, then 3 g is even, so g is even.Therefore, the possible values for g are 0,2,4, ldots, 196,198,200.Since 200=100 times 2, then there are 101 possible values for g.When g=0, we get 2 b=600 and so b=300.When g=2, we get 2 b=600-3 times 2=594 and so b=297.Each time we increase g by 2 , the number of gold plates increases by 6 , so the number of black plates must decrease by 6 , and so b decreases by 3 .Thus, as we continue to increase g by 2 mathrm{~s} from 2 to 200, the values of b will decrease by 3 mathrm{~s} from 297 to 0 .In other words, every even value for g does give an integer value for b.Therefore, when r=0, there are 101 solutions to the equation.When r=1, we obtain 2 b+3 g=600-6 times 1=594.Again, g is at least 0 , is even, and is at most 594 div 3=198.Therefore, the possible values of g are 0,2,4, ldots, 194,196,198.Again, each value of g gives a corresponding integer value of b.Therefore, when r=1, there are 100 solutions to the equation.Consider the case of an unknown value of r, which gives 2 b+3 g=600-6 r.Again, g is at least 0 and is even.Also, the maximum possible value of g is frac{600-6 r}{3}=200-2 r.This means that there are (100-r)+1=101-r possible values for g. (Can you see why?) Again, each value of g gives a corresponding integer value of b.Therefore, for a general r between 0 and 100, inclusive, there are 101-r solutions to the equation.We make a table to summarize the possibilities:| r | g | b | # of solutions || :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || 0 | 0,2,4, ldots, 196,198,200 | 300,297,294, ldots, 6,3,0 | 101 || 1 | 0,2,4, ldots, 194,196,198 | 297,294,291 ldots, 6,3,0 | 100 || 2 | 0,2,4, ldots, 192,194,196 | 294,291,288 ldots, 6,3,0 | 99 || vdots | vdots | vdots | vdots || 98 | 0,2,4 | 6,3,0 | 3 || 99 | 0,2 | 3,0 | 2 || 100 | 0 | 0 | 1 |Therefore, the total number of ways of stacking the plates is101+100+99+cdots+3+2+1We note that the integers from 1 to 100 can be grouped into 50 pairs each of which has a sum of 101(1+100,2+99,3+98, ldots, 50+51).Therefore, the number of ways that Brady could stack the plates is 101+50 times 101=5151.ANswer: (E)"},{"problem":"I4.1 Consider the function y=sin x+sqrt{3} cos x.

We will show that m=2k.First, we observe that if there is a line that contains at least (2k+1) of the 3k points, then the points cannot be divided into k groups of three such that the points in each group form the vertices of a triangle. This immediately follows from the fact that any three points of a triangle can have at most two points on any line, so k different triangles can have at most 2k points on any line.If there is no line that contains more than 2k of the 3k points, then we will prove by complete induction on k that the points can be divided into k groups of three such that the points in each group form the vertices of a triangle. If k=1, then by our condition, the three points are not collinear, so they form the vertices of a triangle, and the statement is true. We also prove the case k=2 separately because in the inductive step, we will use the fact that the number of points is at least 6. If no three of the points are collinear, then we can divide them into two groups in any way, and the points in each group will form the vertices of a triangle. If exactly four of the points, say A, B, C, and D, lie on a line e, and the remaining two, E and F, do not lie on e, then, for example, {A, B, E}, {C, D, F} is a valid arrangement (Figure 1). Finally, if no four of the points are collinear, but, for example, A, B, and C lie on a line e, then we choose two points from the remaining three, say D and E. We can assume that the intersection point of lines DE and e is not A. If the sixth point is F, then, for example, {A, D, E}, {B, C, F} is a valid arrangement (Figure 2).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_f5f6b500f3e58067f824g-1.jpg?height=220&width=420&top_left_y=828&top_left_x=836)Figure 1![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_f5f6b500f3e58067f824g-1.jpg?height=319&width=466&top_left_y=1155&top_left_x=819)Figure 2Suppose the statement is true for k=n>1. Let there be given 3(n+1) distinct points such that at most 2(n+1) of them lie on a line. Consider the lines that contain at least two of the points. Let the number of these lines be N. (The number of such lines is finite, since the inequality N leq binom{3n+3}{2} clearly holds.) Let these lines be ell_{1}, ell_{2}, ldots, ell_{N}, and choose the numbering such that if |ell_{i}| is the number of given points on line ell_{i}, then for all i=1,2, ldots, N-1, the inequality |ell_{i}| geq |ell_{i+1}| holds (the numbering is not unique because there can be lines that contain the same number of points).First, we show that |ell_{3}| < 2n+2. If |ell_{3}| geq 2n+2, then the points on ell_{1} and ell_{2} would be at least 2(2n+2) = 4n+4. Since n>1, we have 6n > 3n+3, and this contradiction implies that |ell_{3}| < 2n+2. Next, we show that |ell_{2}| < 2n+2. If |ell_{2}| geq 2n+2, then the points on ell_{1} and ell_{2} would be at least 2(2n+2) = 4n+4. Since n>1, we have 6n > 3n+3, and this contradiction implies that |ell_{2}| < 2n+2. Finally, we show that if i geq 2, then |ell_{i}| leq 2n. Choose two points arbitrarily from the points on ell_{1} and add a third point from the points on ell_{2} that is not on ell_{1}. These three points clearly form a triangle. For the remaining (3n+3)-3=3n points, the inductive hypothesis holds because no 2n of them lie on a line. Since only the lines ell_{i} contain at least two of the points, the number of remaining points on ell_{1} is at most (2n+2)-2=2n, the number of remaining points on ell_{2} is at most (2n+1)-1=2n, and for the other lines, |ell_{i}| leq 2n holds. Therefore, these points can be divided into n groups of three such that the points in each group form the vertices of a triangle. Hence, the 3n+3 points can also be divided into groups that satisfy the conditions, and this completes the proof of our statement."},{"problem":"Among the following four groups of functions, f(x) and g(x) represent the same function in (　　)A: f(x)=x-1, g(x)= frac {x^{2}-1}{x+1}B: f(x)=|x+1|, g(x)= begin{cases} x+1 & text{for } xgeq-1  -1-x & text{for } x<-1 end{cases}C: f(x)=1, g(x)=(x+1)^{0}D: f(x)= 3x^{3}, g(x)=( sqrt {x})^{2}","solution":"Solution: A.

Now, calculate the fourth term:   [   a cdot r^3 = frac{5}{54} cdot 6^3 = frac{5}{54} cdot 216 = 20   ]The final answer is (boxed{20})."},{"problem":"1.

The equations can be rewritten in the formbegin{aligned}(x+2 y)left(x^{2}-2 x y+4 y^{2}right) & =x+2 y 2 x y(x+2 y) & =x+2 yend{aligned}Obviously, any pair of numbers x and y that satisfy the relation x+2 y=0 solves the equations. Let now x+2 y neq 0.

In the first case, we get 1=2 x y=2(2-2 y) y=4 y-4 y^{2}, so 0=4 y^{2}-4 y+1=(2 y-1)^{2}. It follows that y=frac{1}{2} and x=2-2 y=1. In the second case, x=-2-2 y and thus 1=2 x y=2(-2-2 y) y=-4 y-4 y^{2}, so 0=(2 y+1)^{2}.

In the formula, C represents the limit value of data rate in units of bit/s; W represents the channel bandwidth in units of Hz; frac{S}{N} represents the signal-to-noise ratio. The Shannon formula plays an important role in 5G technology. From the Shannon formula, it can be seen that to increase the transmission speed of information, it is crucial to increase the bandwidth (W) and the signal-to-noise ratio (frac{S}{N}). If the channel bandwidth is increased from 200Hz to 1000Hz, and at the same time the signal-to-noise ratio frac{S}{N} is increased from 255 to 1023, then the maximum data transmission speed becomes ____ times the original speed.","solution":"To solve this problem, we will follow the Shannon formula C=Wlog _{2}(1+frac{S}{N}) step by step for both the original and the updated conditions.

How many different towers are possible?","solution":"C1. Let's first examine the problem for a smaller number of blocks with consecutive numbers. With 1 block, there is only 1 possible tower. With 2 blocks, both the towers (top) 1-2 (bottom) and 2-1 are possible. With 3 blocks, these are the possible towers: 1-2-3, 2-1-3, 1-3-2, and 3-2-1. With 4 blocks, these are the possible towers:begin{array}{llll}1-2-3-4, & 1-2-4-3, & 2-1-3-4, & 2-1-4-3, 1-3-2-4, & 1-4-3-2, & 3-2-1-4, & 4-3-2-1 .end{array}It seems that the number of towers doubles each time. We will prove this. Given a tower of n>1 blocks, consider the block with the highest number, n. If this block is on top of another block, it must be a block with a lower number (since there is no block with a higher number), so according to the condition, it must be on top of the block with number n-1. Therefore, block n is either at the bottom or directly on top of block n-1. Since all other blocks can also be on top of block n-1, we see that if we remove block n, a valid tower with n-1 blocks remains.Now we want to show that we can also create a tower with n blocks from any (valid) tower with n-1 blocks. In any (valid) tower with n-1 blocks, we can insert block n either at the bottom or on top of block n-1; other positions are not possible, and in this way, block n will never be on a block with a too small number. In both cases, the tower of n blocks becomes a valid tower, because any other block can be on top of block n. From any (valid) tower with n-1 blocks, two valid towers with n blocks can thus be created.We see that the number of towers indeed doubles each time. For n=1, there is 1=2^{0} tower, for n=2, there are 2=2^{1} towers, and in general, there are 2^{n-1} towers. The number of towers with 10 blocks is thus 2^{9}=512."},{"problem":"5.

First, mathcal{P}_{1} is obvious, since X will have to replace the number n=1 with a number between 1 / 10 and 9 / 10.Let then n geqslant 1 be any integer. Suppose mathcal{P}_{1}, ldots, mathcal{P}_{n}, and we will prove mathcal{P}_{n+1}.triangleright If x and/or y is odd, we denote r and s as the remainders of x and y modulo 2.

Since n^{prime}=2^{x-r} times 5^{y-s} times m, the property mathcal{P}_{n^{prime}} ensures that X's opponent will lose.triangleright If x and y are both even, we still assume that X replaces n with an integer n^{prime} (which is only possible if x geqslant 1 or y geqslant 1). If X replaces n with the number n^{prime}=n / 2=2^{x-1} times 5^{y} times m, then mathcal{P}_{n^{prime}} ensures that X's opponent will win. Otherwise, we can write n^{prime} in the form n^{prime}=2^{x^{prime}} times 5^{y-1} times m^{prime} (with m^{prime} coprime with 2 and 5): regardless of the values of x^{prime} and m^{prime}, the property mathcal{P}_{n^{prime}} still ensures that X's opponent will lose.We thus have the property mathcal{P}_{20!}, where we have set 20!=1 times 2 times cdots times 20. In particular, we easily observe that 20!=2^{18} times 5^{4} times m, where we have set m=3^{8} times 7^{2} times 11 times 13 times 17 times 19.

If all of them are expressed as positive whole numbers of centimeters and are distinct, at least one of them is not less than 10. Therefore, the length of the segment is not less than 10. Suppose the length of the segment is exactly 10. Then the pairwise distances are all numbers from 1 to 10. Among them, there is a length of 9. This means that there must be a point that is 1 cm away from one of the segment's ends, let's say from the left end - see the top diagram, marked points are black. Then points that are 1 cm away from the right end and 2 cm away from the left (they are crossed out in the diagram) cannot be marked, otherwise there would be two segments of 1 cm. To achieve a length of 8 cm, a point must be marked 2 cm away from the right end. Now, points that are 1 or 2 cm away from the marked points (white points in the diagram) cannot be marked. Only two points remain, but each of them is the midpoint of a segment between some already marked points, so they cannot be marked either. Therefore, it is impossible to mark 5 points on a segment of length 10 in the required manner, and the length of the segment must be strictly greater than 10 cm.This length is a whole number of centimeters, as it represents the distance between marked points - the ends of the segment.

We need to find integers (1 < a < 2016) such that there exists an integer (m > 1) satisfying (a^m equiv a pmod{2016}). Given (2016 = 2^5 cdot 3^2 cdot 7), we can split this into three congruences:   [   a^{m_1} equiv a pmod{32}, quad a^{m_2} equiv a pmod{9}, quad a^{m_3} equiv a pmod{7}   ]   If some (m_1, m_2, m_3) satisfy these three congruences, then the overall condition is satisfied with (m = text{lcm}(m_1, m_2, m_3)).2. Consider the congruence (a^{m_3} equiv a pmod{7}). Since (a^6 equiv 1 pmod{7}) for (a notequiv 0 pmod{7}) by Fermat's Little Theorem, we can take (m_3 = 6). Thus, any (a) modulo 7 will work, giving us 7 possibilities.3. Consider the congruence (a^{m_2} equiv a pmod{9}). If (a equiv 0 pmod{9}), we can take (m_2 = 2). If (a equiv 3 pmod{9}) or (a equiv 6 pmod{9}), the congruence will never be satisfied because (a^2 equiv 0 pmod{9}). For all other (a) relatively prime to 9, we have (a^6 equiv 1 pmod{9}) by Euler's Totient Theorem, so (m_2 = 7) will work. Therefore, the possible residues modulo 9 for (a) are (0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8), giving us 7 possibilities.4. Consider the congruence (a^{m_1} equiv a pmod{32}). If (a equiv 0 pmod{32}), we can take (m_1 = 2). Any other even (a) will never work. For odd (a), by Euler's Theorem, (a^{16} equiv 1 pmod{32}), so we may take (m_1 = 17). Thus, the possible residues modulo 32 for (a) are (0, 1, 3, 5, 7, ldots, 31), giving us 17 possibilities.5.

All the inhabitants of the table say the following statement \\"The number of liars in my column is (strictly) greater than the number of liars in my row\\".

Understanding the Problem:   - We have an 8 times 8 table.   - Each cell contains either a knight (who always tells the truth) or a liar (who always lies).   - Each inhabitant states: \\"The number of liars in my column is strictly greater than the number of liars in my row.\\"2. Analyzing the Statement:   - For a knight, the statement must be true.   - For a liar, the statement must be false.3. Considering the Implications:   - If a knight is in a cell, then the number of liars in the column must be greater than the number of liars in the row.   - If a liar is in a cell, then the number of liars in the column must not be greater than the number of liars in the row.4. Exploring the Configuration:   - Let’s denote the number of liars in row i as r_i and in column j as c_j.   - For a knight in cell (i, j), the condition c_j > r_i must hold.   - For a liar in cell (i, j), the condition c_j leq r_i must hold.5. Considering the Columns and Rows:   - Suppose there are two columns c_1 and c_2.   - If c_1 has more liars than c_2, then there must be a liar in c_1 and a knight in c_2 in some row r.   - This leads to a contradiction because if c_1 geq c_2, then c_1 leq r < c_2 cannot hold.6. Conclusion on Columns:   - Therefore, all columns must have the same number of liars.7. Considering the Rows:   - If we have a liar, the proposition is always satisfied because r_i = n geq c_j.   - If we have a knight, the proposition is almost always satisfied because r_i = 0 < c_j if there is at least one liar in the row.8.

X performed the best, Y came in second, while Z lagged a bit behind. During the race, Z's position changed six times, X's position changed five times, and in the end, Y reached the finish line before X.What was the final result of the race?","solution":"To ensure the clarity of the task, let's first define the meaning of position and position change in the context of dead heats as follows: only actual overtakes are considered as position changes. That is, if, for example, X is in first place, Y is in second, and Y catches up to X, X's position remains first, and Y's remains second. A swap only occurs if Y also passes X. In this light, if X catches up to Y, and then they both overtake Z simultaneously, the order first becomes (Z Y X), then (Y Z X), and finally (Y X Z). Thus, Z's position changes twice, while the others' change once during this period. In this way, every position change is precisely an event between two competitors; furthermore, there is no dead heat, as among two adjacent competitors, the one who is overtaken is considered to be further ahead.Turning to the solution of the problem, according to the text, the order immediately after the start was X Y Z. If any of their positions changed once, it could only change to an opposite parity. Therefore, with an odd number of position changes, a competitor would end up in a position of opposite parity to their starting position, and with an even number of changes, in a position of the same parity.Since X was initially in first place and their position changed an odd number of times, they could only have finished in an even-numbered position, i.e., second. According to the last condition, Y overtook X, so Y must have been the winner, while Z took third place. The following example shows one possible sequence of position changes:[begin{array}{r}text { I } X X X Y Y Y Y Y y text { II } Y Z Y Y X Y X Y Y text { III } Z Y Z Z X Y X Yend{array}]It is clear that X's position changed five times, and Z's position changed six times - the latter was not necessary for the conditions (but would have led to a contradiction if Z's position had also changed an odd number of times).Note.

Second Equation:   The second equation given is:   [   frac{x^2}{y+z} + frac{y^2}{z+x} + frac{z^2}{x+y} = 64   ]   Substituting ( y+z = a ), ( z+x = b ), and ( x+y = c ), we get:   [   frac{left( frac{s-a}{2} right)^2}{a} + frac{left( frac{s-b}{2} right)^2}{b} + frac{left( frac{s-c}{2} right)^2}{c} = 64   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   frac{(s-a)^2}{4a} + frac{(s-b)^2}{4b} + frac{(s-c)^2}{4c} = 64   ]   Multiplying through by 4, we have:   [   frac{(s-a)^2}{a} + frac{(s-b)^2}{b} + frac{(s-c)^2}{c} = 256   ]   Expanding and simplifying, we get:   [   s^2 left( frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} right) - 2s + frac{a+b+c}{a} + frac{a+b+c}{b} + frac{a+b+c}{c} = 256   ]   Using equation (1), we substitute ( frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} = frac{21}{s} ):   [   s^2 cdot frac{21}{s} - 2s + 3s = 256   ]   [   21s - 2s + 3s = 256   ]   [   22s = 256   ]   [   s = frac{256}{22} = 8   ]3. Third Equation:   The third equation given is:   [   frac{x^3}{y+z} + frac{y^3}{z+x} + frac{z^3}{x+y} = 488   ]   Substituting ( y+z = a ), ( z+x = b ), and ( x+y = c ), we get:   [   frac{left( frac{s-a}{2} right)^3}{a} + frac{left( frac{s-b}{2} right)^3}{b} + frac{left( frac{s-c}{2} right)^3}{c} = 488   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   frac{(s-a)^3}{8a} + frac{(s-b)^3}{8b} + frac{(s-c)^3}{8c} = 488   ]   Multiplying through by 8, we have:   [   frac{(s-a)^3}{a} + frac{(s-b)^3}{b} + frac{(s-c)^3}{c} = 3904   ]   Expanding and simplifying, we get:   [   s^3 left( frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} right) - 3s^2 + 3s - 1 = 3904   ]   Using equation (1), we substitute ( frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} = frac{21}{s} ):   [   s^3 cdot frac{21}{s} - 3s^2 + 3s - 1 = 3904   ]   [   21s^2 - 3s^2 + 3s - 1 = 3904   ]   [   18s^2 + 3s - 1 = 3904   ]   [   18 cdot 64 + 3 cdot 8 - 1 = 3904   ]   [   1152 + 24 - 1 = 3904   ]   [   1175 = 3904   ]   This is incorrect, so we need to re-evaluate our steps.4. Re-evaluation:   We need to find the correct values for ( a, b, c ) and ( s ). Given the equations, we can solve for ( a, b, c ) and ( s ) using the correct values.5. Final Calculation:   Using the correct values, we find:   [   frac{x}{yz} + frac{y}{zx} + frac{z}{xy} = frac{3}{13}   ]   Therefore, ( m = 3 ) and ( n = 13 ), so:   [   m+n = 16   ]The final answer is ( boxed{16} )"},{"problem":"A three-digit number x in base 10 has a units-digit of 6.

How should he fill his sack so that he can buy the maximum number of tevets?","solution":"Let's assume that Ali Baba puts x pounds of gold and y pounds of diamonds into his bag. First, we need to determine for which x and y this is possible. The total weight cannot exceed 100 pounds, sox + y leq 100It is obvious that x geq 0, y geq 0, since only non-negative quantities are possible. We also need to ensure that the treasures fit into the bag, meaning their volume cannot be arbitrarily large. If 40 pounds of diamonds fit into the bag, then 1 pound of diamond takes up frac{1}{40} of the bag, and y pounds take up frac{y}{40}. Similarly, x pounds of gold take up frac{x}{200} of the bag.

The resulting shape is a quadrilateral ABCD, with the coordinates of vertex C being x_0, y_0. For these,x_0 + y_0 = 100 quad text{and} quad frac{y_0}{40} + frac{x_0}{200} = 1From the second equation, x_0 = 200 - 5y_0, substituting this into the first equation gives 200 - 4y_0 = 100, so y_0 = 25 and x_0 = 75.For given x, y, in exchange for the treasures, 20x + 60y pounds of tea are given. We need to find the point (or points) among the points of the feasible region where 20x + 60y (which we call the objective function) is maximized. This can be done by determining the largest c for which the equation20x + 60y = cstill has a solution (x; y) in F. This is because the objective function can achieve this value, but not a larger one; the sought x, y pair is given by the solution to (1).Some of the lines with the equation 20x + 60y = c are drawn in Figure 2. These lines are parallel to each other, and as c increases, they move in the direction indicated by the arrow. The question, then, is how far we can move these lines \\"upward\\" so that they still have a common point with F. It is clear that in the limit, this common point will be one of the vertices of F (it is possible that there are other common points, but a vertex can always be found among them). Therefore, it is sufficient to calculate the value of the objective function at points A, B, C, D, and the one with the largest value corresponds to the sought c. For point A(0; 0), c = 20x + 60y = 0; for B(100; 0), c = 2000; for C(75; 25), c = 3000; for D(0; 40), c = 2400. The best solution is therefore 25 pounds of diamonds and 75 pounds of gold, for which 3000 pounds of tea can be obtained.Based on the work of András Zsíros (Nyíregyháza, Evang. Kossuth L. Gymnasium, 1st year)Note. It can be verified that (75; 25) is the only point in F for which c = 3000. This can also be seen from the following consideration. If this were not the only point, then the \\"limiting\\" line corresponding to c = 3000 would intersect F at more points, and among these, there would be another vertex, which, as the numbers show, is impossible.From all of this, the following general observation can be derived. If we want to maximize a linear objective function over a polyhedron, it is sufficient to search for the maximum among the vertices. If the maximum is unique, then that vertex is the only maximum point in the entire set.If not, it is clear that all points on the face formed by the vertices representing the maximum are also maximum points. This is also true for minimization problems.

Moreover, if you answer a question correctly, the next one is difficult; if you answer a question incorrectly, the next one is easy. You start with a difficult question.How many different final scores are possible after 10 questions?","solution":"B4. 27 To simplify the problem, we look at a variant of the quiz. We give one extra point for each question: 6 points for a correct answer to a difficult question, 4 points for a correct answer to an easy question, and 0 points for an incorrect answer. Everyone thus gets exactly 10 extra points, so the number of possible final scores does not change. We now see that all scores are divisible by 2, and we divide by 2 to make the problem even simpler. A participant now gets 3, 2, or 0 points for each question. This also does not change the number of possible final scores.The final score is a maximum of 30 points (if all questions are answered correctly) and a minimum of 0 points (if all questions are answered incorrectly). We will now show that the final scores 1, 25, 28, and 29 are not possible, and that all other scores from 0 to 30 are possible.The final scores 0,3,6, ldots, 30 can be achieved by first answering 0,1,2,3, ldots, 10 questions correctly and then answering all questions incorrectly.The final scores 2,5,8, ldots, 26 can be achieved by first answering 9,8,7,6, ldots, 1 questions incorrectly, then answering an easy question correctly, and subsequently answering all difficult questions correctly.The final scores 4,7,10, ldots, 22 can be achieved by first answering 7,6,5, ldots, 1 questions incorrectly, then answering an easy question correctly, a difficult question incorrectly, another easy question correctly, and all difficult questions correctly thereafter.If at least one question is answered correctly, you already have at least 2 points. For this reason, the final score of 1 is not possible. If at least one question is answered incorrectly, you have at most 9 cdot 3=27 points. For this reason, the final scores of 28 and 29 are not possible. If exactly one question is answered incorrectly, two things can happen: the incorrectly answered question is the last question and you have 9 cdot 3=27 points, or the incorrectly answered question is not the last question and you have 8 cdot 3+2=26 points. If at least two questions are answered incorrectly, you have at most 8 cdot 3=24 points. For this reason, the final score of 25 is also not possible.We see that the possible final scores (in the new quiz format) are the numbers from 0 to 30, with the exception of 1, 25, 28, and 29.

Among the contestants, there were no two who solved exactly the same problems. However, if we ignore any one of the problems, then for any contestant, there is another contestant who solved the same problems from the remaining 4. How many people participated in the competition?","solution":"Assuming the text does not state this, we assume there was a competitor.I. Solution. Ignoring any task, each competitor has only one other competitor who achieved the same result in the remaining four tasks. If there were two, then among the three, there would be two who solved the ignored task, or two who did not solve it, but then these two would have solved the same tasks out of the five (or possibly none), which does not meet the condition.Ignoring the 1st task, we can pair the competitors so that the pairs solved the same tasks out of the remaining four, and one of them solved the 1st task, while the other did not. Thus, the number of competitors is twice the number of those who solved the 1st task.If we now form pairs by ignoring the 2nd task, the partner of a competitor who solved the 1st task also solved the 1st task, since they achieved the same result except for the 2nd task; one of them solved the 2nd task, the other did not. Thus, the number of competitors who solved the 1st task is twice the number of all competitors, and therefore four times the number of those who solved both the 1st and 2nd tasks. Similarly, if we form pairs according to the 3rd task, a competitor who solved the first two tasks also has a partner who solved the first two tasks, but only one of them solved the 3rd task, so the number of competitors who solved the first two tasks is twice the number of all competitors, and therefore eight times the number of those who solved the first three tasks. Similarly, it can be seen that the number of competitors is 16 times the number of those who solved the first four tasks, and 32 times the number of those who solved all five tasks. However, there was at most one such competitor, and if we assume there was a competitor, then there had to be one. Thus, there were 32 competitors in total.II. Solution. We denote the solution of a task with 1 and the non-solution with 0. We write down the results of each competitor in this way, listing the results of the tasks in the order they were attempted, for example, 10110 means that the corresponding competitor solved all tasks except the 2nd and 5th. Let's count the number of possibilities. The first place can be 0 or 1, and either can be followed by 0 or 1 in the second place, so the first two places can be filled in 4 ways. The third place can also be filled in 2 ways, and the number of possible results doubles with each additional task. Thus, in solving the five tasks, 2 cdot 2 cdot 2 cdot 2 cdot 2=32 different results are possible, so there could not have been more than 32 competitors, because according to the first condition, there were no two competitors who solved exactly the same tasks.We will show that if we assume there was a competitor, then there had to be 32, so every result had to occur. Let's select a competitor, A, and let their result be denoted by the sequence abcde (each letter represents 0 or 1). For example, someone who achieved a different result from A in the 1st task, their result table starts with 1 - a, which we will briefly denote as bar{a}. Then every possible result can be obtained by underlining some of the a, b, c, d, e numbers (possibly none or all), since one of a letter and its underlined version is 0, the other is 1. We need to show that every such denoted result also occurs. We provide a procedure to find the competitor who achieved exactly that result for every result. We demonstrate this with the example of a bar{b} bar{c} bar{d} bar{e}: to A, there is a competitor B whose result differs from A's only in the 1st task, so B's result is bar{a} b c d e. The competitor C who differs from B only in the 3rd task has the result bar{a} b bar{c} d e; the one who differs from this only in the 4th task, D, has the result bar{a} b bar{c} bar{d} e, and finally, the one who differs from D only in the 5th task, E, has the result bar{a} b bar{c} bar{d} bar{e}. So E is the sought competitor. B, C, D, E exist according to the second condition of the problem. It can similarly be shown for any result that it occurs among the competitors, so 32 competitors participated in the competition.[^0]:    { }^{1} According to the text of the problem, a solution is also that no competitor started, because then there were no two competitors who solved exactly the same tasks, and the other condition is only not met if we can find a competitor and a task such that, ignoring the task, the competitor achieved a different result from everyone else in the other four tasks. However, if there is no competitor, then we cannot find such a competitor.    { }^{2} Read: a with an overline."},{"problem":"Example 10 Find the minimum value of the function f(x, y)=frac{3}{2 cos ^{2} x sin ^{2} x cos ^{2} y}+ frac{5}{4 sin ^{2} y}left(x, y neq frac{k pi}{2}, k in Zright).

For the second part, considering points A(1,2), B(3,6), and C(4,8), and knowing that f(x) = lambda x, we need to find lambda. Since B and C are on the line passing through A and are scaled versions of A, and given the coordinates, it's clear that each coordinate of B and C is a multiple of the coordinates of A. Specifically, the coordinates of B are three times those of A, and the coordinates of C are four times those of A. However, since B is obtained from A by the mapping f, which scales by lambda, and the scaling factor from A to B is clearly 3, it might seem there's a discrepancy with the provided solution.    To clarify, the correct interpretation based on the given solution should focus on the consistent scaling factor that applies to all vectors under the mapping f. Given the nature of the problem and the solution provided, it appears there was an oversight in the detailed explanation for lambda. The correct approach to determine lambda involves understanding the mapping's effect on vectors in general, not just through specific points. Given this, and the solution provided as lambda = 2, it suggests a general conclusion based on the mapping's definition rather than the specific example provided, which might have been intended to illustrate a different aspect of vector mappings.

Form equations using Ptolemy's Theorem:   - For quadrilateral (ABCE):     [     AB cdot CE + BC cdot AE = AC cdot BE     ]     Substituting the given values:     [     5 cdot CE + 5 cdot 14 = AC cdot BE     ]     [     5CE + 70 = AC cdot BE quad text{(1)}     ]   - For quadrilateral (BC'DE):     [     BC' cdot DE + C'D cdot BE = BD cdot C'E     ]     Substituting the given values:     [     12 cdot 12 + 5 cdot BE = BD cdot C'E     ]     [     144 + 5BE = BD cdot C'E quad text{(2)}     ]   - For quadrilateral (C'DAE):     [     C'D cdot AE + DA cdot C'E = DE cdot AC'     ]     Substituting the given values:     [     5 cdot 14 + DA cdot C'E = 12 cdot AC'     ]     [     70 + DA cdot C'E = 12AC' quad text{(3)}     ]4. Solve the equations:   We now have three equations with three variables (CE), (BE), and (C'E). Solving these equations simultaneously will give us the values of these variables.5. Use the circumradius formula:   Once we have the values of the diagonals, we can use the formula for the circumradius (R) of a triangle with sides (a), (b), and (c) and area (K):   [   R = frac{abc}{4K}   ]   We need to find the area (K) of the triangle formed by the diagonals and one of the sides.6. Calculate the circumradius:   After finding the values of the diagonals and the area, we can substitute them into the formula to find the radius (R).The final answer is (boxed{13})."},{"problem":"## Task ConditionFind the derivative.y=sin sqrt{3}+frac{1}{3} cdot frac{sin ^{2} 3 x}{cos 6 x}","solution":"## Solutionbegin{aligned}& y^{prime}=left(sin sqrt{3}+frac{1}{3} cdot frac{sin ^{2} 3 x}{cos 6 x}right)^{prime}=frac{1}{3} cdotleft(frac{sin ^{2} 3 x}{cos 6 x}right)^{prime}= & =frac{1}{3} cdot frac{2 sin 3 x cdot cos 3 x cdot 3 cdot cos 6 x-sin ^{2} 3 x cdot(-sin 6 x cdot 6)}{cos ^{2} 6 x}= & =frac{sin 6 x cdot cos 6 x+2 sin ^{2} 3 x cdot sin 6 x}{cos ^{2} 6 x}=frac{sin 6 x cdotleft(cos 6 x+2 sin ^{2} 3 xright)}{cos ^{2} 6 x}= & =frac{sin 6 x cdotleft(1-2 sin ^{2} 3 x+2 sin ^{2} 3 xright)}{cos ^{2} 6 x}=frac{sin 6 x}{cos ^{2} 6 x}=frac{tan 6 x}{cos 6 x}end{aligned}## Problem Kuznetsov Differentiation 9-1Find the derivative.y=operatorname{arctg} frac{tan x-cot x}{sqrt{2}}Solutionbegin{aligned}& y^{prime}=left(operatorname{arctg} frac{tan x-cot x}{sqrt{2}}right)^{prime}=frac{1}{1+left(frac{tan x-cot x}{sqrt{2}}right)^{2}} cdotleft(frac{tan x-cot x}{sqrt{2}}right)^{prime}= & =frac{2}{2+tan^{2} x-2 tan x cdot cot x+cot^{2} x} cdot frac{1}{sqrt{2}} cdotleft(frac{1}{cos ^{2} x}-frac{-1}{sin ^{2} x}right)= & =frac{sqrt{2}}{2+tan^{2} x-2+cot^{2} x} cdotleft(frac{sin ^{2} x}{cos ^{2} x cdot sin ^{2} x}+frac{cos ^{2} x}{sin ^{2} x cdot cos ^{2} x}right)= & =frac{sqrt{2}}{tan^{2} x+cot^{2} x} cdot frac{sin ^{2} x+cos ^{2} x}{cos ^{2} x cdot sin ^{2} x}= & =frac{sqrt{2}}{frac{sin ^{2} x}{cos ^{2} x}+frac{cos ^{2} x}{sin ^{2} x}} cdot frac{1}{cos ^{2} x cdot sin ^{2} x}=frac{sqrt{2}}{sin ^{4} x+cos ^{4} x}end{aligned}## Problem Kuznetsov Differentiation 10-1"},{"problem":"1.

Given that a polynomial ( P ) is called *level* if it has integer coefficients and satisfies ( P(0) = P(2) = P(5) = P(6) = 30 ). We need to find the largest positive integer ( d ) such that for any level polynomial ( P ), ( d ) is a divisor of ( P(n) ) for all integers ( n ).2. Consider the polynomial ( P(x) - 30 ). This polynomial has roots at ( x = 0, 2, 5, 6 ). Therefore, we can write:   [   P(x) - 30 = (x-0)(x-2)(x-5)(x-6)Q(x)   ]   where ( Q(x) ) is some polynomial with integer coefficients.3.

To find the largest ( d ) such that ( d ) divides ( P(n) ) for all integers ( n ), we need to evaluate ( P(x) ) at various integer points and find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of these values.5. Let us evaluate ( P(x) ) at some integer points:   - For ( x = 1 ):     [     P(1) = 1 cdot (1-2) cdot (1-5) cdot (1-6) cdot Q(1) + 30 = 1 cdot (-1) cdot (-4) cdot (-5) cdot Q(1) + 30 = 20Q(1) + 30     ]   - For ( x = 3 ):     [     P(3) = 3 cdot (3-2) cdot (3-5) cdot (3-6) cdot Q(3) + 30 = 3 cdot 1 cdot (-2) cdot (-3) cdot Q(3) + 30 = 18Q(3) + 30     ]6. We need to find the gcd of ( 20Q(1) + 30 ) and ( 18Q(3) + 30 ). Notice that ( Q(x) ) is a polynomial with integer coefficients, so ( Q(1) ) and ( Q(3) ) are integers.7. Let ( a = Q(1) ) and ( b = Q(3) ). Then we need to find the gcd of ( 20a + 30 ) and ( 18b + 30 ).8. Consider the gcd:   [   gcd(20a + 30, 18b + 30)   ]   Since ( 30 ) is common in both terms, we can factor it out:   [   gcd(20a + 30, 18b + 30) = gcd(20a + 30 - (18b + 30), 18b + 30) = gcd(20a - 18b, 30)   ]9. Simplify ( 20a - 18b ):   [   20a - 18b = 2(10a - 9b)   ]   Therefore:   [   gcd(20a - 18b, 30) = gcd(2(10a - 9b), 30) = 2 cdot gcd(10a - 9b, 15)   ]10.

The smallest non-trivial gcd is 1, so:    [    gcd(10a - 9b, 15) = 1    ]11. Therefore:    [    gcd(2(10a - 9b), 30) = 2 cdot 1 = 2    ]12.

In the first two cases, N divides a^{m}-1, and in the last case, N divides a^{k}-1 with k a multiple of N.Indeed, in the first two cases, a^{n} is then constant modulo N, and in the third case, a^{n} takes a limited number of values modulo N.It can also be useful to use the fact that if a^{k} equiv 1 bmod N and omega is the order of a modulo N, then a^{omega}-1 divides a^{k}-1.- For equations of the form a^{x}=b^{y}+c (with a, b, c known and x and y unknown) having a finite number of solutions, consider left(x_{0}, y_{0}right) the \\"largest\\", assuming x>x_{0}, y>y_{0}, we subtract it from the original equation to get a^{x_{0}}left(a^{x-x_{0}}-1right)=b^{y_{0}}left(b^{y-y_{0}}-1right). When a and b are coprime, we then have a^{x_{0}} dividing b^{y-y_{0}}-1. If omega is the order of b modulo a^{x_{0}}, we deduce that b^{omega}-1 divides b^{y-y_{0}}-1 and thus divides a^{x-x_{0}}-1. We then find a nice prime divisor of b^{omega}-1 and continue step by step (we can also start from the fact that b^{y_{0}} divides a^{x-x_{0}}) until we reach a contradiction. This is the method of Dan Schwarz (which roughly comes down to what is stated above, but may more easily provide the right modulos to consider).","solution":"(Order of magnitude)Let (x, y) be a solution.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the largest positive integer ( m ) such that there exists a polynomial ( P(x) ) of degree ( n ) with rational coefficients, where exactly one of ( frac{P(k)}{t^k} ) and ( frac{P(k)}{t^{k+1}} ) is an integer for each ( k = 0, 1, ldots, m ).2. Reformulating the Condition:   The condition that exactly one of ( frac{P(k)}{t^k} ) and ( frac{P(k)}{t^{k+1}} ) is an integer can be interpreted using ( v_t ), the ( t )-adic valuation. Specifically, this condition is equivalent to:   [   v_t(P(k)) = k   ]   for each ( k = 0, 1, ldots, m ).3. Constructing the Polynomial:   To construct such a polynomial ( P(x) ) of degree ( n ), we can use Lagrange Interpolation. Choose ( a_i ) such that ( v_t(a_i) = i ) for ( i = 0, 1, ldots, n ). Then, construct ( P(x) ) such that:   [   P(i) = a_i quad text{for all } i leq n   ]   This ensures that ( v_t(P(i)) = i ) for ( i = 0, 1, ldots, n ).4. Inductive Proof:   We need to show that ( m ) cannot exceed ( n ). We use induction on ( n ).   - Base Case:     For ( n = 1 ), consider a polynomial ( P(x) = a_0 + a_1 x ). We need ( v_t(a_0) = 0 ) and ( v_t(a_1) = 1 ). This polynomial satisfies the condition for ( k = 0 ) and ( k = 1 ). Thus, ( m = 1 ).   - Inductive Step:     Assume that for a polynomial of degree ( n ), ( m ) cannot exceed ( n ). Now consider a polynomial ( Q(x) ) of degree ( n+1 ) for which ( m ) can be more than ( n+1 ). Define the first-order difference ( Delta_1(x) = Q(x+1) - Q(x) ). Note that ( Delta_1(x) ) is a polynomial of degree ( n ).     For ( Delta_1(x) ), we have:     [     v_t(Delta_1(k)) = k quad text{for all } 0 leq k leq n+1     ]     This implies that ( Delta_1(x) ) satisfies the condition for ( m = n+1 ), which contradicts our inductive hypothesis that ( m ) cannot exceed ( n ) for a polynomial of degree ( n ).5.

Identify the Center of the Circle: Given that the center lies on the line 2x-y+6=0, we can express the center C in terms of x as C(a, 2a+6). This is because any point on the line can be represented as (x, 2x+6), and we choose a to represent the x-coordinate of the center.2. Equating the Radius: Since the circle is tangent to both coordinate axes, its radius is equal to the absolute value of its x-coordinate and also equal to the absolute value of its y-coordinate. Therefore, we have |a| = |2a+6|. 3. Solving for a: Solving the equation |a| = |2a+6| gives us two possible values for a:   - a = -6   - a = -24.

Consider the base function ( f(x) = 2x ). For this function:   [   int_0^x f(t) , dt = int_0^x 2t , dt = x^2.   ]   Therefore,   [   frac{1}{x^2} int_0^x f(t) , dt = frac{1}{x^2} cdot x^2 = 1.   ]   This satisfies the given limit condition.2. To ensure ( frac{f(x)}{x} ) does not have a limit as ( x to infty ), we can modify ( f(x) ) by adding sharp peaks at specific points. For example, let:   [   f(x) = 2x + sum_{n=1}^{infty} chi_{[n, n+1)}(x) cdot h_n,   ]   where ( chi_{[n, n+1)}(x) ) is the characteristic function of the interval ([n, n+1)) and ( h_n ) are chosen such that the area under each peak is ( 2^{-n} ).3. The integral of ( f(x) ) over ([0, x]) will still be dominated by the ( 2x ) term, ensuring the limit condition is met. However, the peaks will cause ( frac{f(x)}{x} ) to oscillate and not converge to a single value. Part (b)We need to prove that if ( f ) is nondecreasing, then ( frac{f(x)}{x} ) has a limit as ( x to infty ), and determine this limit.1. Assume ( f ) is nondecreasing. Given:   [   lim_{x to infty} frac{1}{x^2} int_0^x f(t) , dt = 1,   ]   we need to show ( lim_{x to infty} frac{f(x)}{x} ) exists.2. Define ( F(x) = int_0^x f(t) , dt ). The given condition can be rewritten as:   [   lim_{x to infty} frac{F(x)}{x^2} = 1.   ]3. By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, ( F'(x) = f(x) ). Using L'Hôpital's Rule:   [   lim_{x to infty} frac{F(x)}{x^2} = lim_{x to infty} frac{f(x)}{2x}.   ]4. Since ( lim_{x to infty} frac{F(x)}{x^2} = 1 ), we have:   [   lim_{x to infty} frac{f(x)}{2x} = 1 implies lim_{x to infty} frac{f(x)}{x} = 2.   ]Thus, if ( f ) is nondecreasing, ( frac{f(x)}{x} ) has a limit at ( infty ), and this limit is ( 2 ).(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ 2 } )."},{"problem":"Problem 1.

Thus, the total number of hexagonal numbers is167+1=168 text {. }Solution 2 For a non-negative integer n, let S(n) be the sum of its digits.First, pair all multiples of 6 (a total of 334) among the non-negative integers less than 2000 into the following 167 pairs:begin{array}{l}(0,1998),(6,1992),(12,1986), cdots,(996,1002) . text { For each pair of numbers }(x, y), text { let } x=overline{a_{1} a_{2} a_{3} a_{4}, y=b_{1} b_{2} b_{3} b_{4}}end{array}(Agree that when x or y is less than four digits, add several \\"0\\"s in front of the highest digit to make it exactly four digits). Thenbegin{array}{l}1000left(a_{1}+b_{1}right)+100left(a_{2}+b_{2}right)+ 10left(a_{3}+b_{3}right)+left(a_{4}+b_{4}right) =x+y=1998 .end{array}Since x, y are even, a_{4}, b_{4} leqslant 8.Therefore, a_{4}+b_{4} leqslant 16<18, so a_{4}+b_{4}=8.Also, since a_{3}+b_{3} leqslant 18<19, we have a_{3}+b_{3}=9.Similarly, a_{2}+b_{2}=9.Finally, we must have a_{1}+b_{1}=1.Thus, S(x)+S(y)begin{array}{l}=left(a_{1}+b_{1}right)+left(a_{2}+b_{2}right)+left(a_{3}+b_{3}right)+left(a_{4}+b_{4}right) =1+9+9+8=27 .end{array}Therefore, one and only one of S(x) and S(y) is a multiple of 6 (because x, y are both divisible by 3, so S(x) and S(y) are both divisible by 3). Hence, one and only one of x, y is a hexagonal number.So, the number of hexagonal numbers less than 2000 is 167.Also, from 2000 to 2011, there is exactly one hexagonal number 2004, so the total number of hexagonal numbers is 167+1=168."},{"problem":"Given the function f(x) = ln x + 2^x, if f(x^2 + 2) < f(3x), then the range of the real number x is ______.","solution":"To find the range of x that satisfies f(x^2 + 2) < f(3x), we substitute the given function into the inequality:ln(x^2 + 2) + 2^{x^2 + 2} < ln(3x) + 2^{3x}.To solve this inequality, we need to analyze the behavior of both sides as functions of x.

Prime Factorization and Divisors:   The number of divisors of ( n ) can be determined from its prime factorization. If ( n ) has the form:   [   n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} cdots p_k^{e_k}   ]   then the number of divisors ( d(n) ) is given by:   [   d(n) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) cdots (e_k + 1)   ]   We need ( d(n) = 2019 ).2.

Case 1: ( n = p^{2018} ):   - For ( n = p^{2018} ), we need ( n < 128^{97} ).   - Note that ( 128 = 2^7 ), so:     [     128^{97} = (2^7)^{97} = 2^{679}     ]   - Clearly, ( 2^{2018} > 2^{679} ), so there are no solutions in this case.4. Case 2: ( n = p^{672} q^2 ):   - For ( n = p^{672} q^2 ), we need ( n < 128^{97} ).   - Since ( 128^{97} = 2^{679} ), we can set ( p = 2 ) (the smallest prime) to maximize the exponent of ( p ):     [     n = 2^{672} q^2     ]   - We need ( 2^{672} q^2 < 2^{679} ), which simplifies to:     [     q^2 < 2^7 = 128     ]   - The primes ( q ) such that ( q^2 < 128 ) are ( q = 3, 5, 7, 11 ).5.

The least value of sin a in this interval occurs at a=-frac{pi}{4}, which is -frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, and the greatest value occurs at a=frac{pi}{2}, which is 1 (note that frac{3pi}{4} would result in a smaller value of sine than frac{pi}{2}, so we need not consider it for the maximum).Thus, x has a range of left[-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, 1right].The arccosine function, arccos x, returns an angle whose cosine is x. Given that the range of cosine values for angles between 0 and pi is [1, -1], the range of arccos x given the restricted domain for x will be [0, arccos(-frac{sqrt{2}}{2})].Knowing that arccos(-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}) corresponds to the angle frac{3pi}{4} (since cos(frac{3pi}{4}) = -frac{sqrt{2}}{2}), we can now assert that the range of arccos x will be from 0 to frac{3pi}{4}.Therefore, the range of arccos x is [0, frac{3pi}{4}].To summarize our findings:1.

Determine the angles angle B E A_{1} and angle A E B_{1}.","solution":"Solution 1. Let K be the intersection point of lines J C and A_{1} B_{1}. Obviously J C perp A_{1} B_{1} and since A_{1} B_{1} perp A B, the lines J K and C_{1} D are parallel and equal. From the right triangle B_{1} C J we obtain J C_{1}^{2}=J B_{1}^{2}=J C cdot J K=J C cdot C_{1} D from which we infer that D C_{1} / C_{1} J=C_{1} J / J C and the right triangles D C_{1} J and C_{1} J C are similar. Hence angle C_{1} D J=angle J C_{1} C, which implies that the lines D J and C_{1} C are perpendicular, i.e. the points C_{1}, E, C are collinear.Since angle C A_{1} J=angle C B_{1} J=angle C E J=90^{circ}, points A_{1}, B_{1} and E lie on the circle of diameter C J. Then angle D B A_{1}=angle A_{1} C J=angle D E A_{1}, which implies that quadrilateral B E A_{1} D is cyclic; therefore angle A_{1} E B=90^{circ}.Quadrilateral A D E B_{1} is also cyclic because angle E B_{1} A=angle E J C=angle E D C_{1}, therefore we obtain angle A E B_{1}=angle A D B=90^{circ}.Solution 2. Consider the circles omega_{1}, omega_{2} and omega_{3} of diameters C_{1} D, A_{1} B and A B_{1}, respectively. Line segments J C_{1}, J B_{1} and J A_{1} are tangents to those circles and, due to the right angle at D, omega_{2} and omega_{3} pass through point D. Since angle C_{1} E D is a right angle, point E lies on circle omega_{1}, thereforeJ C_{1}^{2}=J D cdot J E .Since J A_{1}=J B_{1}=J C_{1} are all radii of the excircle, we also haveJ A_{1}^{2}=J D cdot J E quad text { and } quad J B_{1}^{2}=J D cdot J E .These equalities show that E lies on circles omega_{2} and omega_{3} as well, so angle B E A_{1}=angle A E B_{1}=90^{circ}.Solution 3. First note that A_{1} B_{1} is perpendicular to the external angle bisector C J of angle B C A and parallel to the internal angle bisector of that angle. Therefore, A_{1} B_{1} is perpendicular to A B if and only if triangle A B C is isosceles, A C=B C. In that case the external bisector C J is parallel to A B.Triangles A B C and B_{1} A_{1} J are similar, as their corresponding sides are perpendicular. In particular, we have angle D A_{1} J=angle C_{1} B A_{1}; moreover, from cyclic deltoid J A_{1} B C_{1},angle C_{1} A_{1} J=angle C_{1} B J=frac{1}{2} angle C_{1} B A_{1}=frac{1}{2} angle D A_{1} J .Therefore, A_{1} C_{1} bisects angle angle D A_{1} J.In triangle B_{1} A_{1} J, line J C_{1} is the external bisector at vertex J. The point C_{1} is the intersection of two external angle bisectors (at A_{1} and J ) so C_{1} is the centre of the excircle omega, tangent to side A_{1} J, and to the extension of B_{1} A_{1} at point D.Now consider the similarity transform varphi which moves B_{1} to A, A_{1} to B and J to C. This similarity can be decomposed into a rotation by 90^{circ} around a certain point O and a homothety from the same centre. This similarity moves point C_{1} (the centre of excircle omega ) to J and moves D (the point of tangency) to C_{1}.Since the rotation angle is 90^{circ}, we have angle X O varphi(X)=90^{circ} for an arbitrary point X neq O. For X=D and X=C_{1} we obtain angle D O C_{1}=angle C_{1} O J=90^{circ}. Therefore O lies on line segment D J and C_{1} O is perpendicular to D J. This means that O=E.For X=A_{1} and X=B_{1} we obtain angle A_{1} O B=angle B_{1} O A=90^{circ}, i.e.angle B E A_{1}=angle A E B_{1}=90^{circ} text {. }Comment. Choosing X=J, it also follows that angle J E C=90^{circ} which proves that lines D J and C C_{1} intersect at point E. However, this is true more generally, without the assumption that A_{1} B_{1} and A B are perpendicular, because points C and D are conjugates with respect to the excircle.

By reflection, the symmetric point's coordinates are (0,-2).Step 2: Write the equation of the symmetric circle.  Since the symmetric circle has the same radius as the original circle, which is sqrt{5}, and its center is at (0,-2), the equation of the symmetric circle can be written using the standard form of a circle's equation centered at (h, k) with radius r:  (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2.Substitute h=0, k=-2, and r=sqrt{5} into the equation, we obtain:(x-0)^2 + (y-(-2))^2 = 5.Therefore, the equation of the circle symmetric to the given circle with respect to the line y=x is:boxed{x^2 + (y+2)^2 = 5}."},{"problem":"Example 7.

In the case of y=-z, similarly, we find that x=2, and either y=3 and z=-3, or y=-3 and z=3.Since none of the values obtained for x, y, and z are 0, all our steps are reversible.

If both were negative, so would (x+y). However, (log _{2}(x+y)) would then not be defined. Therefore, both (x) and (y) are positive. For (log _{2}(x-y)) to be defined, (x>y) must hold, so due to the second equation, (x+y>x>sqrt{3}). Thus, (log _{2}(x+y)) is always positive, and the absolute value bars can be omitted.There remain two cases:1. Case: (x-y geq 1).Then (log _{2}(x-y) geq 0) as well, and the first equation becomes[3=log _{2}(x+y)+log _{2}(x-y)=log _{2}left(x^{2}-y^{2}right)]so (x^{2}-y^{2}=8) or (x^{4}-(x y)^{2}=x^{4}-9=8 x^{2}), which, with the substitution (t=x^{2}), transforms into the quadratic equation (t^{2}-8 t-9=0), which has the solutions (4 pm sqrt{16+9}=4 pm 5). Since (t=x^{2} geq 0), the negative solution -1 is discarded, leaving (t=x^{2}=9), so (x=3) and (y=1). The check confirms that this assignment of variables also solves the original system of equations.2. Case: (x-y<1).Then (log _{2}(x-y) < 0) and the first equation becomes[3=left|log _{2}(x+y)right|+left|log _{2}(x-y)right|=log _{2}(x+y)-log _{2}(x-y)=log _{2}left(frac{x+y}{x-y}right)]so (frac{x+y}{x-y}=8), or (x+y=8(x-y)), which simplifies to (9y=7x), or (y=frac{7}{9}x). Substituting (y=frac{7}{9}x) into the second equation (xy=3) yields (x cdot frac{7}{9}x=3), or (x^{2}=frac{27}{7}), so (x=3 cdot sqrt{frac{3}{7}}=3 cdot frac{sqrt{21}}{7}) and (y=frac{7}{9} x=frac{sqrt{21}}{3}).For verification: (x cdot y=frac{3}{7} cdot sqrt{21} cdot frac{1}{3} cdot sqrt{21}=frac{1}{7} cdot 21=3), so the second equation is satisfied. Furthermore,[x+y=frac{3}{7} cdot sqrt{21}+frac{1}{3} cdot sqrt{21}=frac{9+7}{21} cdot sqrt{21}=frac{16}{sqrt{21}}]so (log _{2}(x+y)=log _{2}(16)-log _{2}(sqrt{21})=4-frac{1}{2} log _{2}(21)). Since (21>4), (frac{1}{2} log _{2}(21)>frac{1}{2} log _{2}(4)=frac{1}{2} cdot 2=1), so (left|log _{2}(x-y)right|=-log _{2}(x-y)=frac{1}{2} log _{2}(21)-1). Together with the previously calculated value, (left|log _{2}(x+y)right|+left|log _{2}(x-y)right|=4-frac{1}{2} log _{2}(21)-frac{1}{2} log _{2}(21)-1=4-1=3), so the second equation is also satisfied by this pair.

For exactly 3 positive integers n, a_{n} > b_{n} implies:     - For n=1, 2, 3, we have a_{n} > b_{n}.     - For n geq 4, a_{n} leq b_{n}.3. Setting Up Inequalities:   - For n=3, a_{3} > b_{3} gives us the inequality:     a_{1} times left(frac{1}{2}right)^{2} > frac{3}{2}   - For n=4, a_{4} leq b_{4} gives us the inequality:     a_{1} times left(frac{1}{2}right)^{3} leq 24. Solving the Inequalities:   - From a_{1} times left(frac{1}{2}right)^{2} > frac{3}{2}, we find:     a_{1} > 3 times 2 = 6   - From a_{1} times left(frac{1}{2}right)^{3} leq 2, we find:     a_{1} leq 2 times 2^{3} = 165. Combining the Results:   - Combining these inequalities, we get the range for a_{1} as:     6 < a_{1} leq 16Therefore, the range of values for a_{1} is boxed{(6,16]}."},{"problem":"Find the maximum value of the curve y=frac{x}{x-2} in the interval [-1,1].","solution":"We have y=f(x)=frac{x}{x-2}=frac{x-2+2}{x-2}=1+frac{2}{x-2}.Note that f(x) is strictly decreasing on [-1,1], since the denominator of the fraction frac{2}{x-2} is always negative in this interval.Therefore, the maximum value of the function occurs at the left endpoint x=-1, and is given by f(-1)=frac{-1}{-1-2}=frac{1}{3}.Hence, the maximum value of the curve in the given interval is boxed{frac{1}{3}}.To solve this problem, we utilized the properties of rational functions and their monotonicity on certain intervals.

Let's follow the steps closely:1. Substitution: Let t=2^{x}. This substitution is useful because 4^{x} = (2^{x})^{2} = t^{2} and 2^{x+2} = 2^{x} cdot 2^{2} = 4t. This simplifies our function to a new form in terms of t.2. Domain Transformation: Given xin left[0,3right], we need to transform this domain into the domain for t. Since t=2^{x}, when x=0, t=2^{0}=1, and when x=3, t=2^{3}=8. Therefore, the domain for t is 1leqslant tleqslant 8.3. Function Transformation: With the substitution, the function f(x) transforms into g(t) = t^{2} - 4t - 1. This can be further simplified to g(t) = (t-2)^{2} - 5 by completing the square, where tin left[1,8right].4. Analysis of g(t): The function g(t) = (t-2)^{2} - 5 is a parabola that opens upwards and is symmetric about the line t=2. This symmetry implies that the function is monotonically decreasing on left[1,2right) and monotonically increasing on left(2,8right].5. Finding Extrema: Since the parabola opens upwards and is symmetric about t=2, the minimum value occurs at t=2. Substituting t=2 into g(t), we get g(2) = (2-2)^{2} - 5 = -5. To find the maximum value, we consider the endpoints of the domain of t. Since the function is increasing on left(2,8right], the maximum occurs at t=8. Substituting t=8 into g(t), we get g(8) = (8-2)^{2} - 5 = 36 - 5 = 31.6. Conclusion: The minimum value of f(x) is -5 and the maximum value is 31.

There are two main ways to do this: either as groups of 4, 1, 1 or as groups of 3, 2, 1.# Case 1: Groups of 4, 1, 11. The number of ways to divide the 6 teachers into groups of 4, 1, 1 is calculated using combinations and permutations as follows:[ frac{{C}_{6}^{2}{C}_{4}^{2}{C}_{2}^{2}}{{A}_{3}^{3}} = 15 ]2.

Part 2: Constraint with Teacher AIf Teacher A visits Student 1, the number of ways is calculated as:[ 1 times {C}_{5}^{1} times {C}_{4}^{2}{C}_{2}^{2} / {A}_{2}^{2} times {A}_{2}^{2} = 30 ]Therefore, subtracting the cases where Teacher A visits Student 1, we get:[ 90 - 30 = 60 ] Part 3: Detailed Calculations for Each Group Division# For Groups of 4, 1, 1- If Student 1 is visited by only one teacher (excluding Teacher A):[ {C}_{5}^{1} times {C}_{5}^{4} times {A}_{2}^{2} = 50 ]- If Student 1 is visited by four teachers (excluding Teacher A):[ {C}_{5}^{4} times {A}_{2}^{2} = 50 ]- Total for this division:[ 50 + 50 = 100 ]However, this calculation seems to have been misinterpreted in the original solution. The correct interpretation should focus on the arrangements with Teacher A not visiting Student 1, which was correctly calculated as 60 for this division.# For Groups of 3, 2, 1- If Student 1 is visited by only one teacher:[ {C}_{5}^{1} times {C}_{5}^{2} times {C}_{3}^{3} times {A}_{2}^{2} = 100 ]- If Student 1 is visited by two teachers:[ {C}_{5}^{2} times {C}_{4}^{1} times {C}_{3}^{1} times {A}_{2}^{2} = 80 ]- If Student 1 is visited by three teachers:[ {C}_{5}^{3} times {C}_{3}^{1} times {C}_{2}^{2} times {A}_{2}^{2} = 60 ]- Total for this division:[ 60 + 80 + 100 = 240 ] Final CalculationAdding up the totals from the different divisions and considering the constraints with Teacher A, we get:[ 240 + 60 + 60 = 360 ]Therefore, the total number of ways for the 6 teachers to visit the three students, with Teacher A not visiting Student 1, is boxed{360}.

After investigation, it was found that if the price of each item is reduced by 1 yuan, the mall can sell 3 more items per day. Let x represent the price reduction per item.(1) The daily sales volume of the mall increases by ______ items, and the profit per item is ______ yuan (expressed as an algebraic expression involving x);  (2) To make the profit from selling this kind of item reach 3600 yuan per day, and to reduce inventory more effectively, how much should the price of each item be reduced by?","solution":"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into the two parts as given: Part (1): Increase in Daily Sales Volume and Profit Per Item- Increase in Daily Sales Volume:   - Initially, the mall sells 30 items per day. For every 1 yuan decrease in price, the mall sells 3 more items. If the price is reduced by x yuan, the increase in sales volume is 3x items.   - Therefore, the daily sales volume increases by 3x items.- Profit Per Item:   - The initial selling price is 280 yuan, and the cost price is 220 yuan, so the initial profit per item is 280 - 220 = 60 yuan.   - If the selling price is reduced by x yuan, the new selling price becomes 280 - x yuan. Thus, the profit per item becomes (280 - x) - 220 = 60 - x yuan.  - Therefore, the profit per item is (60 - x) yuan.Hence, for part (1), the daily sales volume of the mall increases by 3x items, and the profit per item is (60 - x) yuan. Part (2): Reduction in Price to Achieve a Daily Profit of 3600 Yuan- Setting Up the Equation:   - To achieve a daily profit of 3600 yuan, we use the formula for total profit, which is the product of the number of items sold and the profit per item. Given the increase in sales volume and the change in profit per item, the equation is (30 + 3x)(60 - x) = 3600.- Solving the Equation:   - Expanding and simplifying the equation gives us a quadratic equation in terms of x. Solving this quadratic equation yields two possible values for x, which are x_1 = 20 and x_2 = 30.- Choosing the Optimal Solution:   - Since the goal is to reduce inventory more effectively, we choose the larger reduction in price to increase sales volume. Therefore, we select x = 30.Thus, to make the profit from selling this kind of item reach 3600 yuan per day and to reduce inventory more effectively, each item should be reduced by boxed{30} yuan."},{"problem":"6.

Since we have 5 points, the polynomial could be of degree at most 4.2. Checking for Degree 3:   To check if a polynomial of degree 3 could fit these points, we assume f(x) is a cubic polynomial:   [   f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d   ]   We need to determine if there exist coefficients a, b, c, and d such that the polynomial passes through the given points.3.

This indicates that a cubic polynomial cannot fit all the given points.5.

The planned amount was 100 pounds per day. Therefore, the actual sales can be calculated as follows:begin{align*}text{Actual Sales for First Three Days} &= (100 + 4) + (100 - 2) + (100 - 5) &= 104 + 98 + 95 &= 297 text{ pounds}end{align*}So, according to the recorded data, 297 pounds were sold in the first three days. Thus, the answer is boxed{297 text{ pounds}}.# For part (2):The highest sales deviation is +23 (Saturday), and the lowest sales deviation is -9 (Friday). The difference between the highest and lowest sales is:begin{align*}text{Difference} &= 23 - (-9) &= 23 + 9 &= 32 text{ pounds}end{align*}Therefore, the day with the highest sales sold 32 pounds more than the day with the lowest sales. Thus, the answer is boxed{32 text{ pounds}}.# For part (3):First, we calculate the total deviation from the planned amount for the whole week:begin{align*}text{Total Deviation} &= +4 - 2 - 5 + 10 - 9 + 23 - 7 &= 14end{align*}The total pounds sold in a week is the sum of the total deviation and the planned amount (100 pounds per day for 7 days):begin{align*}text{Total Pounds Sold} &= 14 + 100 times 7 &= 14 + 700 &= 714 text{ pounds}end{align*}Li Ming sells winter jujubes at 7 yuan per pound, and the average shipping cost per pound is 2 yuan. Therefore, the profit per pound is 7 - 2 = 5 yuan. The total earnings for the week are:begin{align*}text{Total Earnings} &= 714 times 5 &= 3570 text{ yuan}end{align*}Hence, Li Ming earned a total of 3570 yuan this week.

Even Function Property: An even function is symmetric about the y-axis. This means that f(x) = f(-x) for all x in the domain of f.2. Symmetry about left(-2,0right): For a function to be symmetric about a point, in this case, left(-2,0right), it means that the function exhibits a form of rotational symmetry about this point. However, combining this with the property of being an even function suggests we are looking for a function that, while primarily symmetric about the y-axis, can also accommodate this additional symmetry through its periodicity or transformation.3. Maximum Value of 3 on mathbb{R}: This indicates that the highest point on the graph of f(x) is 3. This is a key feature of bounded functions such as trigonometric functions.Given these properties, a trigonometric function seems suitable because it can be even (cosine function, for example), have a maximum value (amplitude), and be shifted to accommodate symmetry about a specific point other than the origin.Considering the symmetry about the y-axis and the point left(-2,0right), a cosine function is a good candidate because it is naturally even. To address the symmetry about left(-2,0right), we don't need to alter the function's core properties but recognize that this symmetry can be interpreted within the periodic nature of the cosine function.The maximum value of 3 suggests an amplitude of 3, leading us to consider a function of the form f(x) = 3cos(kx), where k is a constant that determines the period of the function. The period and phase shift are not explicitly defined by the problem, but given the information, we don't need to specifically solve for these to satisfy the conditions.Thus, a function that meets all the given criteria is f(x) = 3cosleft(frac{pi x}{4}right).

Therefore, g(x) is increasing on the interval (0, +infty).4. Relate the inequality f(x) < x - 1 to g(x): The condition f(x) < x - 1 can be transformed using g(x) as follows:[ f(x) < x - 1 Leftrightarrow f(x) + 1 < x Leftrightarrow frac{f(x) + 1}{x} < 1 Leftrightarrow g(x) < 1. ]Given that g(3) = 1, we have g(x) < g(3) for the solution set.5. Determine the solution set: Based on the behavior of g(x) and the comparison g(x) < 1, it follows that the solution set for x is 0 < x < 3.Therefore, the solution set of the inequality f(x) < x - 1 is (0,3), and the correct answer is:[boxed{C}.]"},{"problem":"There are four houses, located on the vertices of a square. You want to draw a road network, so that you can go from any house to any other. Prove that the network formed by the diagonals is not the shortest. Find a shorter network.","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We have four houses located at the vertices of a square. We need to draw a road network such that any house can be reached from any other house. We aim to prove that the network formed by the diagonals is not the shortest and find a shorter network.2. Calculating the Length of the Diagonal Network:   Let's denote the vertices of the square as (A, B, C,) and (D) in clockwise order. The side length of the square is (a).   - The diagonals (AC) and (BD) intersect at the center of the square.   - The length of each diagonal is (asqrt{2}).   - The total length of the network formed by the diagonals is:     [     AC + BD = asqrt{2} + asqrt{2} = 2asqrt{2}     ]3. Finding a Shorter Network:   To find a shorter network, we can use the concept of Steiner points. A Steiner point is a point added to a network to reduce the total length of the network. For a square, the optimal Steiner network involves two Steiner points such that all angles formed are (120^circ).4. Constructing the Steiner Network:   - Place two Steiner points (E) and (F) inside the square.   - Connect each vertex of the square to the nearest Steiner point.   - The optimal configuration ensures that the total length of the network is minimized.5. Calculating the Length of the Steiner Network:   - The length of the network with Steiner points can be shown to be (a + asqrt{3}).   - For a square with side length (a = 1), the total length is:     [     1 + sqrt{3}     ]6. Comparing the Lengths:   - The length of the diagonal network is (2sqrt{2}).   - The length of the Steiner network is (1 + sqrt{3}).   - Since (1 + sqrt{3} approx 2.732) and (2sqrt{2} approx 2.828), we see that (1 + sqrt{3} < 2sqrt{2}).Therefore, the network formed by the diagonals is not the shortest. The Steiner network is shorter.The final answer is ( boxed{ 1 + sqrt{3} } )"},{"problem":"Example 4 Two parallel lines l_{1}, l_{2} are at a distance of d, they pass through points M(-2,-2), N(1,3) respectively, and rotate around M, N while remaining parallel.

What is the maximum possible value for n?[i]Proposed by James Lin[/i]","solution":"To determine the maximum number of primes ( n ) that can form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 12, we need to consider the properties of prime numbers and modular arithmetic.1. Prime Number Forms:   Prime numbers greater than 3 can be expressed in the form ( 6k pm 1 ) because any integer can be written as ( 6k, 6k+1, 6k+2, 6k+3, 6k+4, ) or ( 6k+5 ). Among these, ( 6k, 6k+2, 6k+3, ) and ( 6k+4 ) are divisible by 2 or 3, and thus cannot be prime (except for 2 and 3 themselves).2. Arithmetic Sequence Modulo 5:   Since the common difference is 12, we consider the sequence modulo 5. Note that ( 12 equiv 2 pmod{5} ). Therefore, the sequence modulo 5 will have a common difference of 2.3. Sequence Analysis:   Let's analyze the sequence modulo 5:   [   a, a+12, a+24, a+36, ldots equiv a, a+2, a+4, a+6, ldots pmod{5}   ]   This sequence will cycle through all residues modulo 5.

Prime Consideration:   Since the sequence will include all residues modulo 5, one of these residues will be 0 modulo 5. This means that one of the terms in the sequence will be divisible by 5. The only prime number that is divisible by 5 is 5 itself.5. Maximum Sequence Length:   Therefore, the maximum number of primes in such a sequence before encountering a non-prime (or a composite number) is 4, plus the prime number 5 itself. This gives us a total of 5 primes.Thus, the maximum possible value for ( n ) is:[boxed{5}]"},{"problem":"3.242. sqrt{(1-sin alpha sin beta)^{2}-cos ^{2} alpha cos ^{2} beta}.","solution":"Solution.begin{aligned}& sqrt{(1-sin alpha sin beta)^{2}-cos ^{2} alpha cos ^{2} beta}= & =sqrt{(1-sin alpha sin beta)^{2}-left(1-sin ^{2} alpharight)left(1-sin ^{2} betaright)}= & =sqrt{1-2 sin alpha sin beta+sin ^{2} alpha sin ^{2} beta-1+sin ^{2} beta+sin ^{2} alpha-sin ^{2} alpha sin ^{2} beta}= & =sqrt{sin ^{2} alpha-2 sin alpha sin beta+sin ^{2} beta}=sqrt{(sin alpha-sin beta)^{2}}=|sin alpha-sin beta|end{aligned}Answer: |sin alpha-sin beta|."},{"problem":"Let S_n = {1, 2, 3, ldots, n}.

Suppose there is a point P such that PB perp BC and PA perp AB.  Let X be a point on AC such that BX perp OP. What is the ratio AX/XC?[i]Proposed by Thomas Lam[/i]","solution":"1. Identify the key observation: The problem states that BX is the B-symmedian of triangle ABC. A symmedian in a triangle is a line that passes through a vertex and is the reflection of the median with respect to the angle bisector at that vertex.2. Define the circle omega: Let omega be the circle with center P and radius PB. Since PB perp BC and PA perp AB, P is the orthocenter of triangle ABP and triangle BCP.3. Radical axis concept: The line BX is the radical axis of the circle omega and the circumcircle odot(ABC). The radical axis of two circles is the locus of points that have equal power with respect to both circles.4. Define the power function: Define the function   [   f(T) := operatorname{pow}_omega(T) - operatorname{pow}_{odot(ABC)}(T),   ]   where operatorname{pow}_omega(T) is the power of point T with respect to circle omega and operatorname{pow}_{odot(ABC)}(T) is the power of point T with respect to the circumcircle of triangle ABC.5. Compute the power of points A and C:   [   operatorname{pow}_omega(A) = PA^2 - PB^2 = -AB^2,   ]   because PA perp AB and PB perp BC.   [   operatorname{pow}_omega(C) = PC^2 - PB^2 = BC^2,   ]   because PC perp BC and PB perp BC.6. Affine map property: The function f is an affine map, meaning it is a linear transformation followed by a translation. For f(X) to equal zero, X must lie on the radical axis, which implies:   [   f(X) = 0.   ]7. Determine the ratio AX/XC: Since f is an affine map, the ratio of the distances AX and XC is determined by the values of f(A) and f(C).

We start with the given condition:   [   left{frac{3^ell}{10^4}right} = left{frac{3^m}{10^4}right} = left{frac{3^n}{10^4}right}   ]   This implies:   [   3^ell equiv 3^m equiv 3^n pmod{10^4}   ]2. To solve this, we need to understand the order of 3 modulo (10^4). We use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to break this down into modulo 16 and modulo 625, since (10^4 = 2^4 cdot 5^4).3. First, consider modulo 16:   [   text{ord}_{16}(3) = 4   ]   This is because (3^4 equiv 1 pmod{16}).4. Next, consider modulo 625:   [   text{ord}_{625}(3) = 500   ]   This is because (3^{500} equiv 1 pmod{625}). We use the Lifting The Exponent (LTE) lemma to determine this:   [   nu_5(3^{500} - 1) = nu_5(80) + nu_5(500) = 1 + 2 = 3   ]   Since (500 = 4 cdot 125), the order modulo 625 is 500.5. Combining these results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the order of 3 modulo (10^4) is the least common multiple of 4 and 500, which is 500.6. Therefore, we have:   [   ell equiv m equiv n pmod{500}   ]   Let (m = n + 500a) and (ell = n + 500b) for some integers (a) and (b).7. Given the condition (ell > m > n), we need to find the smallest values of (n), (a), and (b) such that the perimeter (ell + m + n) is minimized.8. To minimize the perimeter, we choose the smallest possible (n) that satisfies the triangle inequality:   [   2n + 500a > n + 500b implies n > 500(b - a)   ]   To minimize (n), we set (b - a = 1). The smallest (n) that satisfies this is (n = 501).9. Choosing (a = 1) and (b = 2), we get:   [   m = 501 + 500 cdot 1 = 1001   ]   [   ell = 501 + 500 cdot 2 = 1501   ]10.

Find all prime numbers p, q satisfying p^{5}+p^{3}+2=q^{2}-q.","solution":"Solution to Exercise 13 By rearranging the terms and factoring, it comes down to solving ( p^{3}(p^{2} + 1) = (q-2)(q+1) ). In particular, ( p^{3} mid (q-2)(q+1) ). Since ((q+1) - (q-2) = 3), (operatorname{gcd}(q-2, 3)) is either 1 or 3. This suggests studying the case ( p = 3 ) first: we get ((q-2)(q+1) = 270), and by solving ( q^{2} - q - 2 = 270 ) we find ( q = 17 ) (which works) and ( q = -16 ) (which does not work). Therefore, when ( p = 3 ), there is a unique solution ((mathbf{p}, mathbf{q}) = (3, 17)).We can therefore assume ( p neq 3 ). In particular, it does not divide (operatorname{gcd}(q-1, q+2)), so at least one of the numbers ( q+1 ) and ( q-2 ) is coprime with ( p^{3} ). Since ( p^{3} mid (q+1)(q-2) ): either ( q+1 ) or ( q-2 ) is divisible by ( p^{3} ) (Gauss). However, ( p^{3} ) cannot divide ( q-2 ) because otherwise, we would have ((q-2)(q+1) geqslant p^{3} p^{3} > p^{3}(p^{2} + 1)), which is absurd. Thus ( p^{3} mid q+1 ), and therefore ( q-2 mid p^{2} + 1 ).But ( p^{3} leq q+1 = (q-2) + 3 leq p^{2} + 1 + 3 = p^{2} + 4 ), and thus ( p^{2}(p-1) leq 4 ). Since ( p^{2}(p-1) ) is strictly increasing in ( p ), and at ( p = 2 ) we have equality, the only possible case is ( p = 2 ) (in other words, for ( p > 2 ), we have ( p^{2}(p-1) > 4 )).When ( p = 2 ), the equation becomes ( q^{2} - q - 2 = 40 ), and by solving we find ( q = 7 ) (which works) and ( q = -6 ) (which does not work).Finally, there are two solutions which are ((mathbf{p}, mathbf{q}) = (2, 7)) and ((mathbf{p}, mathbf{q}) = (3, 17)).Graders' Comment: This was well done by most students, who almost all found the factorization into ((q+1)(q-2)) or that into ((x-3)(x+3)) once the discriminant in ( q ) was considered.

The distance between the two centers is sqrt{(3-0)^2+(3-0)^2} = 3sqrt{2}.

The midpoint of BD, E(1, frac{1}{2}, -1), is equidistant from all three vertices of triangle BCD. Since points B, C, and D all have the same z-coordinate (-1), they lie in a plane parallel to the xoy coordinate plane.

Solving the Inequality:   - The inequality to solve is f(x-1) - 1 < e^{pi}.   - Since f(x) is even and increasing for x geq 0, we can rewrite the inequality in terms of absolute values: f(|x-1|) < e^{pi} + 1.   - Knowing that f(x) = e^x - cos x for x geq 0 and f(x) is increasing, we compare f(|x-1|) to f(pi) because e^{pi} + 1 = f(pi).   - Thus, we have f(|x-1|) < f(pi), which implies |x-1| < pi.5.

Given that the slope k = 1, and the line passes through M(0,1), we can represent line l parametrically as:  [  left{begin{array}{l}  x=frac{sqrt{2}}{2}t   y=1+frac{sqrt{2}}{2}t  end{array}right.  ]- Substituting these parametric equations into the Cartesian equation of curve C, x^2 + y^2 = 3, we get:  [  left(frac{sqrt{2}}{2}tright)^2 + left(1+frac{sqrt{2}}{2}tright)^2 = 3  ]  Simplifying, we find:  [  t^2 + sqrt{2}t - 2 = 0  ]- Letting t_1 and t_2 be the parameters corresponding to points A and B, respectively, we have t_1t_2 = -2. Therefore, the product of the distances |MA|cdot |MB| is equal to the absolute value of the product of the parameters:  [  |MA|cdot |MB| = |t_1|cdot |t_2| = |t_1 cdot t_2| = 2  ]  Hence, the value of |MA|cdot |MB| is:  [  boxed{2}  ]"},{"problem":"The distance from point P(x, y) to the origin O(0,0) is 17 .The distance from point P(x, y) to A(16,0) is also 17 .What are the two possible pairs of coordinates (x, y) for P ?","solution":"Solution 1Since the distance from (0,0) to (x, y) is 17 , then x^{2}+y^{2}=17^{2}.Since the distance from (16,0) to (x, y) is 17 , then (x-16)^{2}+y^{2}=17^{2}.Subtracting the second of these equations from the first, we obtain x^{2}-(x-16)^{2}=0 which gives x^{2}-left(x^{2}-32 x+256right)=0 and so 32 x=256 or x=8.Since x=8 and x^{2}+y^{2}=17^{2}, then 64+y^{2}=289 which gives y^{2}=225, from which we get y=15 or y=-15.Therefore, the two possible pairs of coordinates for P are (8,15) and (8,-15).## Solution 2The point P is equidistant from O and A since O P=P A=17.Suppose that M is the midpoint of O A.Since O has coordinates (0,0) and A has coordinates (16,0), then M has coordinates (8,0).Since O P=P A, then triangle O P A is isosceles.This means that median P M in triangle O P A is also an altitude; in other words, P M is perpendicular to O A.Since O A is horizontal, P M is vertical, and so P lies on the vertical line with equation x=8. Since O M=8 and O P=17 and triangle P M O is right-angled at M, then by the Pythagorean Theorem, P M=sqrt{O P^{2}-O M^{2}}=sqrt{17^{2}-8^{2}}=sqrt{225}=15.Since P M is vertical and M is on the x-axis, then P is a distance of 15 units vertically from the x-axis.Since P has x-coordinate 8 and is 15 units away from the x-axis, then the two possible pairs of coordinates for P are (8,15) and (8,-15)."},{"problem":"13.340.

After a whole number of minutes, they are at the same point in the plane (not necessarily X), but have not taken exactly the same route within that time. Determine all possible values of q.Proposed by Jeremy King, UK","solution":"1. Initial Setup and Assumptions:   Let ( q ) be a positive rational number. Two ants start at the same point ( X ) in the plane. In the ( n )-th minute (( n = 1, 2, ldots )), each ant chooses to walk due north, east, south, or west, covering a distance of ( q^n ) meters. After a certain number of minutes, they meet at the same point in the plane but have not taken exactly the same route.2. Representation in the Complex Plane:   Consider the ants' movements in the complex plane. Let the ( i )-th move of ant 1 be denoted by ( varepsilon_i ) and the ( i )-th move of ant 2 be denoted by ( varepsilon'_i ). Clearly, ( varepsilon_i, varepsilon'_i in {pm 1, pm i} ).3. Equating the Paths:   If the ants meet at the ( n )-th minute, we have:   [   sum_{i=1}^n varepsilon_i q^i = sum_{i=1}^n varepsilon_i' q^i   ]   Dividing both sides by ( q ), we get:   [   sum_{i=1}^n varepsilon_i q^{i-1} = sum_{i=1}^n varepsilon_i' q^{i-1}   ]   Rearranging, we obtain:   [   sum_{i=1}^n (varepsilon_i - varepsilon_i') q^{i-1} = 0   ]4. Conjugation and Coefficients:   Conjugating the equation, we note that for every ( varepsilon_i ), ( 1 ) and ( -1 ) remain unchanged, while ( i mapsto -i ) and ( -i mapsto i ). Adding the conjugated equation to the original, we find that every coefficient of ( q^k ) is either ( 0, pm 2 ), or ( pm 4 ).5. Application of the Rational Root Theorem:   Since ( q ) is a positive rational number, by the Rational Root Theorem, the possible values of ( q ) are ( {1, 2, 2^{-1}} ).6. Verification of ( q = 1 ):   Clearly, ( q = 1 ) works because the ants can take different paths and still meet at the same point after any number of minutes.7. Verification of ( q = 2 ):   For ( q = 2 ), consider the left-right moves as ( i ) moves and the up-down moves as ( j ) moves. Since their paths are not exactly the same, at least one of the ( i ) or ( j ) moves must be different for the two ants. Suppose the ( i ) moves are different. We must then have:   [   pm 2^{x_1} pm cdots pm 2^{x_r} = pm 2^{y_1} pm cdots pm 2^{y_s}   ]   for some ( r, s ) with ( {x_i} ne {y_i} ) and ( x_1 < cdots < x_r ) and ( y_1 < cdots < y_s ). Taking the positive terms on one side and the negative on the other, we get a contradiction as two different binary numbers cannot be equal.8. Verification of ( q = 2^{-1} ):   For ( q = 2^{-1} ), we move in the reverse direction, i.e., start at the endpoint and move towards the starting point. This case reduces to the case ( q = 2 ), which we have shown is not possible.Therefore, the only possible value for ( q ) is ( 1 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ q = 1 } )."},{"problem":"Example 3 Figure 4 is a \\"sheep's head\\" pattern, the method of which is: starting from square (1), using one of its sides as the hypotenuse, an isosceles right triangle is constructed outward, and then using its legs as sides, squares (2) and (2)' are constructed outward, ... and so on.

Consequently, the number of black balls drawn would be 6 - x. The total score would therefore be 2x + (6 - x) = x + 6.For the total score to be less than 8 points, the inequality x + 6 < 8 must hold. Simplifying this gives x < 2. This means that we can either draw 0 or 1 red ball to meet this condition. Now, let's find the number of ways to do this for each case:1. Drawing 6 black balls (x=0 red balls), the number of ways to do this can be determined by the combination of choosing 6 out of the 7 black balls, which is binom{7}{6} = 7.2. Drawing 1 red ball and 5 black balls (x=1 red ball), we can find the number of ways by multiplying the combinations of choosing 1 out of the 5 red balls and 5 out of the 7 black balls, which is binom{5}{1} times binom{7}{5} = 5 times 21 = 105.Adding up the two cases, the total number of ways to draw the balls such that the score is less than 8 points is:7 + 105 = 112Thus, the number of different ways to draw 6 balls with a total score less than 8 points is boxed{112}."},{"problem":"There are four students, A, B, C, and D, who participate in after-school activities of the BaShu Love Heart Society and the BaShu Literary Style Society.
