The back ache is definitely not due to a back problem - it feels more like a flu back ache or that I have gotten with intestinal bugs. Tried ibuprophen, heating pads, and even my last resort whiskey shots, but they didn t help. Then I remembered that aspirin has helped with kidney problems in the past, and it worked well on the back ache, but still had the sweats and chills. Temp ranged from 97.2 to 99.7, so I thought maybe sweats chills and flushing were hot flashes (53 yr old female), but they were pretty constant, about every 10 minutes all day long. Last 2 days symptoms seemed to be better and got my appetite back, but today I woke up with intense back ache again and aspirin is not helping. Could this be a virus?","Doctor":"Hi Welcome to HCMI have gone to thru  your query regarding your back ache sweats & chills . I can understand your concern .

Other times I just feel sick until I get up and walk around then I burp and pass gas constantly. Needless to say I haven t been getting much sleep. I have also been running a fever between 99.5 and 100.4. I have a history of acid reflux, ulcers and a hiatal hernia? The acid reflux and ulcers were under control. I watch what I eat, elevate my head when I sleep and I don t eat before bed. I take pantaprozole twice a day. I am obese and have diabetes. My question is could this be a sign that the hernia has gotten worse and should I see my gastro doctor?","Doctor":"Hi! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Yes, these symptoms could be due to your diagnosed hiatal hernia. However, chances of an amebiasis would have to be ruled out specially if you were used to eat from outside. If I were your doctor, I would advise you for the following:1) A routine stool test for ova and cyst and treat it if positive which would relieve your symptoms.2) Elevate the head end of the bed with two blocks on each side, so that the regurgitation does not occur while lying down, and the contents of esophagus and stomach flow down with gravity.3) Some modification in your diet like more of roughage, enough liquids, avoidance of oily, fried, and fast food along with avoiding any kind of alcoholic beverages and smoking if you do.4) Regular routine exercises like morning walk depending on your medical fitness.5) Prescription for a prokinetic agent and a proton pump inhibitor  for symptomatic relief and to have a control on the acid production and facilitate movement of gastric contents downwards6) Your fever could be due to any kind of intestinal infections specially if you eat from outside, or might be an independent entity itself which would have to be investigated.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.The pain could be due to the acid reflux, as other factors were excluded by the investigations as noted by you. If I were your doctor, I would advise you for the following:1) Elevate the head end of the bed with two blocks on each side, so that the regurgitation does not occur while lying down, and the contents of esophagus and stomach flow down with gravity.2) Some modification in your diet like more of roughage, enough liquids, avoidance of oily, fried, and fast food, and avoidance of alcoholic beverages and smoking if you do.3) Regular routine exercises like morning walk depending on your medical fitness.4) Prescription for a prokinetic agent and a proton pump inhibitor  for symptomatic relief and to have a control on the acid production and facilitate movement of gastric contents downwards.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. With the history your have provided about left sided abdominal pains with inability to eat anything other than English Muffin, eggs and bananas the probable causes can be one or more of the following:Intolerance to other foods thus causing severe pain and obvious weight loss. IBS that is irritable bowel syndrome. Gastritis. Since you have already visited two hospitals I would advise you the following in such a situation: Consult a Gastroenterologist for clinical evaluation and investigations. Upper GI Endoscopy, Colonoscopy, CT scan of abdomen. Tests of stool for 3 days. Tests of blood and urine. Any other tests as would be advised. All these will lead to a proper diagnosis. If the intolerance for food is present then avoiding these is the best way and try for newer foods so that you can have proper foods and nutrition. Take multivitamins and mineral supplements.

I am 58 years old and 5'9\\" tall","Doctor":"Hello,Your description is suggestive of a muscular skeletal pain, probably lumbar spondylosis with lumbar disc prolapse. I see patients with this problem in my practice.The light headedness is due to a decrease in the blood circulation in the brain due to the change in posture. You are likely to have cervical spondylosis along with the lumbar spondylosis which co-exist very often. Two blood vessels which supply the areas concerned with balance ( vertebral arteries) have their course through the cerebral vertebrae and the blood flow through them can be compromised due to the cervical spondylosis. Sudden change of gravity by straightening up may  tilt the balance in the blood flow leading to dizziness. Another contributing factor can be the pain .You require to be investigated to confirm these.If you have further queries, I am available.Dr. Noble Zachariah, Kuwait"},{"Patient":"i was admitted to hospital yesterday wit severe lower bak pain my gp tought kidneystones  had blood urine n scan tests notin showed was released n told take pain killers tat maby it passed  but still v sore only confort i get is lyin down  n i tink mt side swolen now","Doctor":"HelloThank You for contacting HCM.There are multiple causes of lower back pain.

I will try my best to answer your queryIdeally the best thing would have been to get examined by neurologist for injuries and nerve test. By testing your power, bulk, reflexes etc we can localize the site of the problem some what.There are three possible sites where injury may have occured. Here is a simplified way how we can test them-It may be more appropriate to do an MRI of the spine. What happens very often is that the x ray misses the findings, especially initially. It is very common. I will suggest an MRI. This is a more detailed study and we have better chances of picking up the changes than an x ray. Also I will suggest an nerve conduction velocity (NCV). The idea is that the MRI may not pick up all the possible changes. Very often, the Injury may have taken at a place lower than the spine, say like the nerve root (radicle) or the nerve itself. This can be picked up by an NCV easily.A third spot may be the muscles injury. It is quite a real possibility. And may be picked up by the MRI too.I hope this helps you.

I will try my best to answer your queryI think you need to understand that the nerves of many parts of the body are related. When doing colonoscopy or endoscopy, air is infused in the system so that we can visualize this system. When this air is left back, and some part of it is almost there till it gets reabsorbed, there may be pain in the stomach and often in back.The pain you may have had initially is due to local action. The nerves of stomach/intestine are affected. Then the other related nerves are affected and this may lead to backache. It is caller referred pain.Referred pain is like when two parts of the body are supplied by the same nerve, the brain may mistakenly read that the pain is in one part of the body while it is actually in another part of the body.You may therefore just wait for the pain to pass.

Recurrence of severe low back pain in May 2010 with right lower leg symptoms and suspicion of altered bladder function. Sequences: Sagittal T1 and T2 weighted images of the lumbar spine have been acquired with axial T1 and T2 weighted images. Post gadolinium sagittal and axial images have also been acquired. For the purposes of this report the L5/S1 disc is assumed to be at image 701-03. Findings: The L1/L2, L2/L3, L3/L4 and L4/L5 discs are within normal limits. Mild facet joint hypertrophy is seen at L4/L5 but there is no evidence of significant canal or neural compromise at this level. At L5/S1 the disc is degenerate with significant loss of height. There is a small annular disc bulge and there is minor narrowing of the lateral recesses but no evidence of significant root compression. No significant canal narrowing is seen. The visualised spinal cord returns a normal signal and the conus terminates at L1.

You can send your MRI films or report. So that I can help you better.Hope this answers your query. If you have additional questions or follow up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us.

For over 50 years have been on many meds including morphine, lately 300mg Tramadol and 150mg Lyrica daily. Gave these up two years ago and went thru withdrawal symptoms but felt more with it as a result. My history is laminectomy of L4, L5 and fusion of L5-S1 plus numerous procedures including freezing of nerves, multiple spinal injections etc over several years. I am a foundation member of the Chronic Pain Clinic in QE2 Hospital, Perth. My specialist tells me no further surgery would be beneficial ( the sciatic nerve is under pressure from the previous ops and lower back and leg pain is constant) keeping me awake at night. Q: Last month my GP prescribed same meds as I was taking (Tramadol & Lyrica) as I found I was not coping with the pain with over-the-counter pain killers....not being able to sleep. On the first doses I was violently ill, and although I persevered at half-dosage, nausea and vomiting cont...so I stopped. Any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hello, I have studied your case.Yes this may be side effect of lyrica.This medicine may take some time so that your body suits it.You can again start with low dose.You may need to do MRI spine again to see for nerve compression If your new MRI shows disc bulge with nerve compression then surgery may help.Due to compression of this nerve root there is tingling numbness in your leg and pain associated with it.For these symptoms analgesic and neurotropic medication can be started.Till time, avoid lifting weights, Sit with support to back.

Sudden onset of pain at the site mentioned by you is most likely due to two possible cause. 1.

Cervical disc disease: Working out in gym in improper posture can cause disc problem at your neck region.    Among these two muscle spasm is a simple problem which will relief by itself in a day or two. But disc problem needs medical attention.

Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.From your history, it seems to me like you got a muscle strain due to over stretching as narrated by you. If I were your doctor, I would advise you for an anti inflammatory drug along with a proton pump inhibitor drug for a symptomatic relief,which could gradually be weaned off once the pain vanishes. To rule out the possibility of a gall stone disease however I would advise you to undergo an ultrasound scanning of your abdomen. Further management would depend on the ultrasound report. You could continue taking Thyronorm tablets as before. A repeat thyroid function test every 3-6 months would be helpful in titrating the dose of Thyronorm for you.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

If i take this for a long.will it damage other organ if i imagine continuing it till age 40 50.i mean the health issue.Is there not any excersise than can relief me? Any yog. Please assist me. Thanks Doctor","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your queries and an understanding of the problem. First of all understand that hernia is projection of some organ out of its normal place. In Hiatus Hernia, the part of the upper stomach slides through the diaphragm into the chest. This coccus through a natural hole in the diaphragm which allows a few structures to pass through. Due to inherent weakness or wideness of the hole, it allows the stomach to slide through into the chest. The operation can be successful and laparoscopy allows to get this done through small key-holes. The recovery is fast and you can start moving the next day.  Yes, surgery can cure but at the same time other principals have to be followed by you very strictly- like loss of obesity, small frequent meals, no smoking , no drinking alcohol, Surgery is not very complex in the hands of an experienced surgeon; you can visit a gastro surgical center if you want the best Surgeons for this particular problems. Rekool suppresses the acid secretion of the stomach to reduce the pain , you can always stop it after 6 months of use. It may not be necessary to use after a successful surgery. There are no serious side effects. It will not damage other organs. You have to continue walking after food as an exercises , and I can not really comment whether Yoga will help you in such conditions wherein surgery is indicated. Do not worry much, that increases acidity and symptoms of hiatus hernia. Go to the specialty center , get evaluated and operated if advised so."},{"Patient":"I was exiting the bath tub and it was slippery.

I am trying not to have surgery I have a lot of problems unbearable pain I had therapy, epidural,pain killers,muscle relaxers etc. nothing has helped could you please help me if you can give me some helpful advice I would appreciate it Thank you","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for writing to HCM about your query,Brief Answer - Anti-inflammatory medication such as aspirin, Physical therapy , Steroid injections etc.Explained Answer - Conservative treatment of lower disc pain usually is successful over time. It includes:1. Pain medication or pain therapies such as ultrasound, massage or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation2. Anti-inflammatory medication such as aspirin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen3. Physical therapy4. Steroid injections5. Education in proper stretching and posture6. RestHowever, if your pain doesn't respond to conservative treatment in two to four weeks, your condition affects your bowel or bladder function,or if it threatens permanent nerve damage, your doctor may suggest surgery.The surgery usually includes removing the part of the disc that has squeezed outside its proper place, called a discectomy. The surgeon also may want to remove the back part of the vertebrae, called the lamina, In a laminectomy; or to surgically open the foramen, the holes on the side of the vertebrae through which the nerves exit, in a foramenotomy. Only about 10 percent of adult lumbar disc patients require surgery and even fewer children and adolescents.Hope You will find it out helpful.Thanks And Regards,Dr. Gaurav Prajapati"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have taken a solid hit to my lower back on my left side (I think my kidney) it has been painful for 2 weeks now and is sore mostly when I bend or apply tension to the muscles in that area. I have not urinated blood Improvement in past 2 weeks seems minimal Please advise","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for writing to HCM about your query,Brief Answer -Treatment for lower back pain depends upon the patient's history and the type and severity of pain, as you described i explained below meditation. Explained Answer -The vast majority of lower back pain cases get better within six weeks without surgery, and lower back pain exercises are almost always part of a treatment plan.If pain persists or worsens, more involved diagnostic and surgical procedures may be recommended.     Medications : A wide variety of over-the-counter and prescription medications is available to help reduce symptoms of lower back pain.Many medications reduce inflammation, which is often a cause of pain, while others work to inhibit the transmission of pain signals from reaching the brain.Each medication has multiple unique risks, possible side effects and drug (or food or supplement) interactions, which need to be evaluated by a physician.Also i would suggest Rest for sometime more because Ceasing activity for a few days allows injured tissue and even nerve roots to begin to heal, which in turn will help relieve lower back pain. However, more than a few days of rest can lead to a weakening of the muscles, and weak muscles have to struggle to adequately support the spine. Patients who do not regularly exercise to build strength and flexibility are more likely to experience recurrent or prolonged lower back pain.Hope You will find it out helpful.Thanks And Regards,Dr. Gaurav Prajapati"},{"Patient":"I had a fall on Sunday in the bathroom and I still have pain in the back near the spine.

Thank you for posting your concern to HCM.From the symptoms you are describing looks like you have an urinary tract infection, and you may need antibiotics to prevent it from getting worse. If I was your caring doctor I would suggest the following:1) Sweats and chills are sign of probable fever. Check it and if its higher then 98,6 F (37oC), you may take Paracetamol 500mg or Ibuprofen 400 mg as needed, max 4 times/day, with food.2) Drink plenty of fluids, so the urinary bladder will empty many times, and pour the bacteria out.3) I would do a urine analyses, and a urine culture before starting antibiotic. 4) I would suggest taking Ciprofloxacin 500mg twice/day for 5 days, which is used in cases when the urinary tract infection gives fever (If you are not allergic of it). Meanwhile the result of the urine culture will come out in 2 days time, and you may change the antibiotic according its result then.If any more clarification needed, feel free to ask.Regards."},{"Patient":"My name is bhuvanesh.

If you have a pinched nerve (nerve compression) your body may send you warning signals such as pain. Don't ignore these warning signals.Damage from a pinched nerve may be minor or severe. It may cause temporary or long-lasting problems. The earlier you get a diagnosis and treatment for nerve compression, the more quickly you'll find relief.In some cases, you can't reverse the damage from a pinched nerve. But treatment usually relieves pain and other symptoms.Hope You will find it out helpful.Thanks And Regards,Dr. Gaurav Prajapati"},{"Patient":"hi i have had right lower back pain for 4 years after my 3rdchild was born, always a dull ache but after activity and movement. its around 6 centermeters from my tail bone and than 5 centermenter to the right side it hurts when i press it. some days are good others not good.","Doctor":"Hii....looks like you  have a mechanical back pain.

Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.There is nothing to be nervous about H Pylori. This is a kind of infection of the mucosa of stomach, and it could be cured easily. This could also be the reason for the symptoms of GERD like burning in stomach due to gastritis. The pain on the right side could be an extension of the pain from gastritis, or could be due to calculus disease of the gall bladder.If I were your doctor, apart from treating you with antibiotics for the H pylori infection, I would also advise you for a proton pump inhibitor drug for a symptomatic relief. I would also advise you for some modification in your diet like more of roughage, enough liquids, avoidance of oily, fried, and fast food and regular routine exercises like morning walk depending on your medical fitness. Avoidance of alcoholic beverages and smoking is an essential part of the treatment. Apart from this, I would also advise you for an ultrasound abdomen to rule out chances of any gall stone disease.

Will sometimes move from right hip inward. This does leave for a few days but returns. I have had an ultra sound and cat scan done, with results showing nothing of concern. Have wondered if it could be the start of an appendix or ovarian issue, but the symptoms I have leave and come back. Would appreciate some educated info as what I should do. Thank you","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for posting your concern in the HCM.Dull aching pain in the back may be due to several reasons, which need to be excluded by further evaluation.This may be due to1. Mechanical back pain. This may be due to faulty posture or injury to paraspinal muscles due to any reason. The former cause seems to be more likely because the pain is on and off.2. Any liver or pancreatic pathology. This seems to be less likely, taking into consideration that your imaging reports came out to be normal. Furthermore, they more commonly cause pain over both abdomen and back.3. Functional bowel disease. If you have irregular bowel habit and / or bloating, the pain may arise from the same. This is more common with constipation predominantly irritable bowel syndrome.4. Renal or ureteric pathology , stone or urinary tract infection may be associated with this. Usually, the pain is associated with dysuria, fever with chills etc. in these cases. However, renal pain may present with this alone. I think your imaging should have ruled out this also.5. Ovarian pathology e.g SOL, infected cyst or torsion may produce back pain. Even genital infection or PID may present with this.Appendicitis usually don't present with back pain as a sole complaint.I think except for mechanical back pain and IBS or FBD all others can be ruled out by imaging (usg or CAT scan).Therefore, you should consult your local physician  for further evaluation.For the time being1. Maintain good oral hydration2. Avoid refined carbohydrate, spices and carbonated beverages. Have high fiber diet at frequent interval in small amount.3. Perform abdominal muscle strengthening exercise.For any further questions, please write back to me.Regards,Dr. Kaushik"},{"Patient":"I am 26 years old, I have acid reflux and get a series of gas attacks.

Frequent small meals rich in dietary fiber.Avoid carbonated beverages, smoking, alcohol and spices.5.

This may also be due to PIVD, but that is less likely. Regarding urogenital symptoms, you have only increased frequency of urination. This may or may not be due to urinary tract infection. UTI may produce back pain. However, that pain is usually dull aching and persistent, except for the condition when one has a ureteric stone. But, increased frequency may also occur in normal individuals in the absence of any infection.I think you should consult your local urologist for further evaluation.You should have the following tests done-Complete blood count, urea, creatinineUrine for routine examinationXray LS Spine- ap/latUSG KUBFor the time being please have plenty of oral fluid.Avoid prolonged sitting or carrying heavy weight.Performed abdominal muscles strengthening exercise.You may need antibiotics, if you are having UTI.For any further questions, please write back to me.Regards,Dr. Kaushik"},{"Patient":"I've been having sudden, sharp lower pain in the right side of my back for the past few days.

It may be due to lumbar spondylosis or degenerative lumbar disease or a prolapsed intervertebral disc in the lumbar region. It may also be due to sciatica. An MRI of the Lumbosacral spine can better elicit the underlying reason and it may also guide the treatment management part. However, the medications she is having are correct. Fibrogesic would help in neuropathic or radicular pain, whereas the other medicines would help in degenerative disease condition. However, till date there is no medicine for absolute cure for this problem. Fibrogesic does help, but to a limited extent and also it takes some time to act .If the pain is severe, she should have bed rest. Traction is an old but very effective methods. Physiotherapy and local heat therapy are also effective and they can also interrupt disease progression.After subsidence of pain, if possible ask your wife to avoid prolonged sitting, carrying heavy weight and advocate to continue with abdominal muscle strengthening exercise if possible.She may also need a lumbar brace.If the pain still remains intractable you should consult a spine surgeon with your MRI report. Surgical treatment may be needed at that point of time.For any further questions,please write back to me directly.Regards,Dr. Kaushik"},{"Patient":"I keep having preasure in my chest and back I get some relief when I burp.

At this age, mechanical back pain is very common.  Particularly, this may be due to faulty posture, lax abdominal muscles and sedentary lifestyle. Although you do not sit for more than 3 hours, frequent change of posture is needed to avoid back pain. Also, you should sit with your back perpendicular with the sit, so that you don't bend forward.Abdominal muscle strengthening exercise should also be started.Please also avoid carrying heavy weight.The pain may also be related to bowel problems or anxiety. If you have irregular bowel habit, with or without bloating, you should have high fiber diet, plenty of oral fluid. Please avoid carbonated beverages, alcohol and smoking.You should also have relaxation session for 30 min. Per day before bedtime to abate stress.For increased pain, you may have Tab Paracetamol 500 mg SOS, min. 6hr interval between 2 doses.If the pain persists, despite following these measures or the test results are not normal, you should consult a specialist in Orthopaedics.For any further questions, please write back.Regards,Dr. Kaushik"},{"Patient":"I am 29,5'4, 145 lbs.

Lower back pain may be due to numerous reasons including urogenital infection, spinal abnormalities, colonic pathology, anxiety disorder, mechanical back pain etc. A detailed history is needed also along with clinical examination. If you are having bright red blood in stool, it may be due to hemorrhoid or diverticular disease or inflammatory bowel disease or gi infection.

Multiple antibiotics wouldn't help you in this condition. Rather they would kill the protective gut bacteria. To confirm absence of any pulmonary disease , you may have a CT scan of chest done. If there is no abnormality, you should consult a local gastroenterologist.I usually advice my patients with these symptoms to haveTab Rabeprazole+Levosupiride extended release combination once daily before breakfast for 14 days.You may also have some antitussive for dry cough, e.g. Grilinctus D syr 2 tsf twice daily for 5 days.As you were on multiple antibiotics, you should have probiotics, e.g. enterogermina oral suspension twice daily for 15 days.Please avoid smoking, carbonated beverages, alcohol and spices.

If the pain is in lower back, spinal abnormalities, mechanical back pain due to faulty posture, urogenital infection including PID, colonic pathology should be ruled out. As your doctors have already performed imaging I think any obvious spinal abnormality has been ruled out. If you have not yet done a routine urine examination, you should have it done at the earliest. Your should also have a stool test done for routine examination and OBT. These are important because you have a high ESR which suggests some infection or inflammation.Mechanical back pain may not display any obvious abnormalities in these test. It is due to faulty posture or prolonged sitting etc. It may be relieved by correction of posture and abdominal muscle strengthening exercise. I will particularly emphasize this because you have a history of abdominal surgery in past which might have caused lax abdominal muscles resulting in overload on paraspinal muscles.In case of pain in mid or upper back, a serum amylase and lipase test and liver function test should be done to ruled out any liver or pancreas problem.Last but not the least, anxiety disorder and functional problems like regional pain syndrome may pose with similar problem. You should also start daily relaxation session for at least 30 min just before going to bed.

Commoner ones are- mechanical back pain, lumbar spondylosis, degenerative lumbar disease, UTI, Renal pathology or bowel problems.Therefore, a detailed history, physical examination and tests are needed for diagnosis.For the time being, my advice isXray LS Spine - Ap/lat (you haven't specified what Xray he has done. If the same was already done, you won't need to repeat)Complete blood count, urea, creatinine, Calcium, Vit D(25)Urine for routine examinationHe should have high fiber diet and Ispagulah husk 2 tsf in a cup of water at bedtime.Tab Paracetamol 500 mg twice daily for 3 days. Bed rest for 2 days.You should also consult your local physician for further evaluation. You may also need to consult an orthopaedic surgeon, if your physician feels that there is musculoskeletal problem.MRI of LS Spine may also be needed to rule out any spine abnormality.Regarding your concern about prostate, I would say that if there is any burning sensation during urination, difficulty in voiding, reduced flow, severe constipation he needs to have per rectal examination by your local doctor to rule out prostate enlargement. In that case you may need ultrasound examination and serum PSA level.For any further questions, please write back.Regards,Dr. Kaushik"},{"Patient":"hello sirI am pratima having 11 weeks of pregnancy. My back is aching like anything. I am unable to my regular activities ; i have consulted a doctor and she has prescribed suprox r tablets for 1 month.

However,it can cause increased maternal heart rate.Back pain is quite common in pregnancy. You should avoid constipation and maintaining fixed posture or prolonged sitting to avoid worsening of back pain. Ispagulah husk 2 tsf in cup of water at bedtime and high fiber diet would help you avoid constipation. After the first trimester, you may also start pregnancy exercises after proper training from your Obstetrician, which would also help you.Thirdly, preferably you should lie down in left lateral position. This will help in blood circulation and also avoid stress to paraspinal muscles.Please avoid any analgesic. You should also have a routine urine examination, because UTI is very common in pregnancy and may cause back pain too.For any further questions, please write back.Regards,Dr. Kaushik"},{"Patient":"Hi I currently went to dr with back pain & my urine culture was positive for Beta hemolytic strep group b (50,000-100,000 colonies).

You should have a repeat urinalysis and Urine for culture and sensitivity testing. If the infection persists, your antibiotic treatment should be guided by sensitivity report.You should also have a USG of lower abdomen to rule out any renal pathology or stone in the urinary tract or any ovarian pathology.Concurrent genital tract infection and pelvic inflammatory diseases are common in patients with UTI. Therefore, you should also consult a gynaecologist for evaluation.For the time being, you should maintain good oral hydration.You should also have the following blood tests done-Complete blood count, urea, creatinine, electrolytes, uric acid.For increased pain, you may have Tab Paracetamol 500 mg SOS, min. 6hr interval between two tables.You should consult your local urologist for further evaluation.For any further questions, please write back.Regards,Dr. Kaushik"},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, Rather than overload your outside system I m contacting you direct with a problem ( obviously ) which will not go away, It s a pain between my neck & shoulder, directly central, It s constant/permanent, I am extremely worried as I thought it was only a NECK CRICK, But obviously this is a different ailment,, I hope You can respond,,,,","Doctor":"welcome to hcm,Causes of neck pain include:      Abnormalities in the bone or joints       Trauma       Poor posture      Degenerative diseases      Tumors       Muscle strainhe shoulder is a ball and socket joint with a large range of movement.

Therefore, you should have a routine urine examination also.You should also have a KOH test of vaginal secretion. NAT is done to rule out other causative organisms of PID.A complete blood count with ESR, urea, creatinine tests should be done.You should also consult your local gynaecologist for clinical examination and further management.In case you are diagnosed with any infection, appropriate antibiotic treatment will be needed.

I was lifting weights, and I think what happened is during a shoulder press I leaned too far back. I have a pain in my upper lumbar/lower thoracic (can t tell) region. It is 100% pain free until I either hyperextend my back fully or round it fully. When I hyperextend my back, I feel a bruise like pain, similar to when I bruised my tailbone up (although not nearly as painful). I have the bruise feeling when I press on the disc as well. I cannot tell if it is a disc or muscular injury. It hasn t gotten much better over the time I ve had it. The pain isn t bad at all, I can still lift normally (but I m taking it light just incase), but I m scared it s a disc injury. I have no numbness/tingles/any nerve related symptoms. Just wondering if this sounds like a muscle strain of some sort, I don t want to mess with my back! If I had a disc injury, would I know?","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for posting your concern in the HCM.Considering your quick recovery, I think it was a mechanical back pain, without any underlying disc prooblem. As your muscle guarding of the local paraspinal muscles are relaxed now,  You are pain free. The absence of radicular symptoms and absence of tingling and numbness also point to the same. However, to be confirmed that you do not have a spinal injury or post traumatic disc prolapse ,you should consult a local orthopaedic surgeon, and have an MRI of LS Spine done.Now, as you are pain free I would also suggest you to perform some abdominal muscle strengthening exercises. Please also avoid prolonged sitting in a fixed posture.For any further questions, please write back.Regards,Dr. Kaushik."},{"Patient":"My MRI results for lower back pain states--Disc desiccation and minimal posterior disc protrusion slightly asymmetric toward the right. The thecal sac is indented without narrowing of the spinal canal. Disc minimally narrows both neural foramen and lateral recesses. What does this mean? Thank you","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for posting your concern in the HCM.Your MRI finding suggests that you have an early degenerative disc space disease, with herniation of the disc posteriorly and towards right. This has caused pressure over the thecal sac. The lumen size of neural foramen and lateral recess has decreased.Actually, between the bodies of our vertebrae, their are jelly like material which prevents friction during movement. Degenerative conditions cause the water content of that material reduced, which is disc desiccation. As the degenerative disease progresses, that material bulges and eventually herniated out from its usual location This would cause back pain as well as pain along the supply of the nerves , which come out from the spinal cord due to narrowing of their outlet causing more pressure.I think you should immediately consult your spine surgeon or orthopaedic surgeon for further management.For the time being, if you have pain, you should take bed rest. Traction may also be needed.If you are pain free, you should perform abdominal muscle strengthening exercise. Please also avoid lifting heavy weight.For any further questions, please write back.Regards,Dr. Kaushik"},{"Patient":"I have lower back pain right side for a long time went to the er got ct scan dident see any thang X-ray same thang uerin test said little blood did blood work no infection but I do have diverticulitis can any one help Ben haveing this pain on and off for years","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for posting your concern in the HCM.Yes, diverticular disease can produce back pain. As per the information provided you had blood in urinalysis too. I think further evaluation is needed for the same. Although your blood infection came out to be normal, blood in urine may also be due to glomerulonephritis, stone in kidney or ureter, any other bladder pathology including CA. All these can cause back pain. If your CT scan was for abdomen, I think these possibilities have been ruled out except for glomerulonephritis. For this the urinalysis report and sediment analysis is very imp[ortant. You may need to consult a nephrologist to rule out the same. You may also need to have the following tests done-CBC, ESR, Complement levels, BUN, creatinine.Your Xray may rule out any bony abnormality. But, you need to have an MRI of LS spine to be confirmed that there is no spinal abnormality.You should also have a routine stool examination done. In case of exacerbation of the diverticular disease, a clear liquid diet for 2-3 days alongwith a broad spectrum antibiotic, e.g. ciprofloxacin may help. For long term dietary management, you should be on high fibre low fat diet. You should also consult your local gastroenterologist for further evaluation.For any further information, please write back to me.Regards,Dr. Kaushik"},{"Patient":"Hi I ve having sharp lower back pain, that when I wake up in the morning it takes me awhile to walk normally, also I actively wake two hours a day and I seem to have problems with that too.

I think you're having radicular pain involving your lower and upper back. Information regarding your age, any history of recent or past trauma, is very important to come to a specific diagnosis. However, both upper and lower back pain with radiation and leg numbness suggests lumbar spondylosis alongwith degenerative disease of the spine. You should consult your local spine surgeon or orthopedic surgeon at the earliest for further evaluation. You would need to have Xray of LS spine-AP/Lat view along with MRI of the whole spine (cervical, dorsal, lumbosacral) to find out any abnormality.You should have the following tests done too- Blood for CBC, ESR, urea, creatinine, calcium, vit D(25), fasting TSH, HbA1cI usually advice my patients to have Pregabaline+Mecobalamine combination capsule, if they present with similar problem. It is available in Indian market in the name of Fibrogesic or Pregaba-M.Please avoid having alcohol, spices, carbonated beverages, tobacco.For severe muscle pain I usually advice my patients to have cyclobenzaprine 15 mg at bedtime along with Paracetamol 650 mg SOS (min. 6 hr. interval between 2 doses).For any further information, write back to me directly.Regards,Dr. Kaushik"},{"Patient":"Hello doc, That one of my friend having back pain while sleeping cause of her body shape well it s perfect and some said me it s common for girls..

Please help!","Doctor":"Thank you for writing to us,Brief Answer-Its not a big issue you may find answer here.Detailed Answer-For chronic back pain:A single event may not have caused your pain. You may have been doing many activities, such as lifting the wrong way, for a long time. Then suddenly, one simple movement, such as reaching for something or bending from your waist, leads to pain.Many people with chronic back pain have arthritis. Or they may have extra wear and tear of the spine, which may be due to:  1.  Heavy use from work or sports  2.  Injuries or fractures  3.  SurgeryFor hip pain:Pain in the hip can result from a number of factors. Abnormalities of the skin, nerves, bones, joints, blood vessels, and soft tissues of the hip can all result in pain. Sometimes diseases that affect other joints in the body, such as arthritis, can be the cause of pain in the hip. Trauma, including bone fracture, is also a cause of hip pain. Pain in the hip area may also originate from painful infections or other conditions of the skin, such as shingles. Hip pain may also occur because of a problem with the back or spine. Treatments for hip pain depend on the underlying cause."},{"Patient":"I just started taking hCG DROPS.  and I'm experiencing weird pain in my back and legs.  Not sure if it has anything to do with the hcg drops. It might have started prior to me taking the drops but seems to be worse. But that could be what was happening anyway.  I've been on the drops for only 5 days.","Doctor":"Thank you for writing to us, Brief Answer-headaches for the first couple days and leg cramps.Detailed Answer-HCG drops has these side effects like headaches for the first couple days and leg cramps.Both of these effects are from the low calorie diet and your body detoxing and can be fixed easily.First, for the headache that’s just your body detoxing from all the bad food that you have been eating before the diet. It is leaving your body because you are drinking so much water and your body is feeding off of your stored fat which has these bad chemicals stored in your body. But don’t worry, it only last a day or two and you can take a headache medication to help with any discomfort.Now onto the leg cramps. Leg cramps are common while on the diet and that’s from a lack of potassium. You can’t eat bananas while on the diet so in order to fix this you take a simple potassium supplement and that always solves the problem."},{"Patient":"hi, I am 31 weeks pregnant and I had a really bad pain on my upper stomach to my belly button, it felt like a menstrual cramp but more intense and today i experienced it again in my lower stomach. the baby is moving like normal.. is this normal? or what could it be?","Doctor":"Hi! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. If I were your doctor I would go for an ultrasound of your abdomen to rule out any intra abdominal pathology like a gall stone disease not uncommon in getting precipitated during pregnancy , and also rule out by physical examination any chances of an appendix infection which might cause pain higher up at this stage. Apart from this, the ultrasound would also let us know the position and well being of the fetus, and the placenta as well. Further management would depend on the results of the physical examination and the ultrasound report.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I have that I UD and have also been diagnosed with gilberts syndrome, but have been having pain in back and pins and needles down my leg, right now its only in my foot. Had MRI and ex rays that showed nothing wrong with my back. Could it be Wilson s disease or the copper in the IUD effecting me.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for posting your concern in the HCM.Copper containing IUDs are known to exacerbate Wilson's disease or existing Chronic Liver Disease. But, there is no convincing evidence that they cause Wilson's disease.As you have Gilbert Syndrome, your bilirubin level may be a bit high. But, that would not precipitate Wilson's disease too.But, it would be better to switch to some newer IUDs if you have any form of Gilbert syndrome.Regarding your pins and needles sensation, It is definitely due to some form of neuropathy. As you have normal imaging findings, I have to say the back pain may be mechanical  or due to pathology other than a skeletal one, e.g. Pelvic inflammation, or colonic problem or UTI etc.A healthy diet, avoidance of faulty posture and abdominal muscle strengthening exercise may help you.  Along with that, a vitamin supplement rich in B complex may also help.You should consult your gynaecological doctor for further evaluation. A routine urinalysis, 24 hr urine protein should be done.For further information please write back to me.

The stabbing pain is also accompanied by a feeling of running out of breath. I wake up constantly in the middle of the night and feel the left part of my back numb and moments later in pain. I have noticed that placing a heating pad in this area relieves some of the pain, but not for long. It seems as if any movement that draws my left shoulder blade closer to the spine causes this pain.

I was wondering I have had pretty bad back pain for a while now and it seems that the dr. can't find anything wrong from xray. I also had orthopedic surgeon check it out and they found nothing. I was wondering could this be from a complication of my horseshoe kidney.","Doctor":"Hi, I think renal complications may cause back pain. Renal complications are more particularly when you have a horse shoe kidney. Chances of urinary trat infections are much more with horse shoe kidney. This may cause a lower back pain. Any form of glomerular disease should also be ruled out, particularly because you have back pain, horseshoe kidney and hypertension. As you have a normal Xray and your orthopaedic consultant has excluded any bony abnormalities, musculoskeletal reasons seem less likely. However, mechanical back pain, particularly due to faulty posture during sitting or standing or prolonged sitting or lax abdominal muscles may not display any clinical sign or imaging abnormality. Thirdly, a colonic pain may present similarly. Irregular bowel habit may or may not be associated with this.A fourth common consideration is pelvic inflammatory disease or endometriosis or any uterine abnormality. For the time being, my recommendations are-1. Urine for routine examination2. USG lower abdomen including KUB3. Plenty of oral fluid, preferably 3 lit per day.4. Analgesia with tab paracetamol 500 mg twice daily.5. Abdominal muscle strengthening exercise6. Continue with antihypertensive medication and cardiac medications.Few more informations are needed regarding fever, bladder and bowel habit, pain abdomen for a more detailed answer.Regards,Dr. Kaushik"},{"Patient":"hi,doc.my mother in low is 70,she fall at our house last week.she has severe backache.we consult the doc.he did examine her &done x-ray spine.ostopenia is there.doc gave her painkiller,nasal spray &gave advice of total bed rest.but after a week the pain not subside totally.she has constipation also from 8 to 10 days.we gave her suppositeris &enema also,but she passed only small amount of stool &water,not clear the faecus from bowel.she is fat also.so please give some advice how we do for this problem?","Doctor":"Hi, traumatic back pain in a 70 year old lady having osteopenia is a matter of concern.  Back pain is also aggravated by associated constipation.  Constipation may be a sequelae of spinal injury after back pain too.If your mother is not passing stool even after suppositories and enemas, she needs to be evaluated further for subacute intestinal obstruction. A straight xray abdomen may be helpful to findout that or suspected fecal impaction. If your mother has severe bloating and nausea and/or vomiting she should be hospitalized under care of a general surgeon, who would evaluate her for any intestinal obstruction. Secondly, no subsidence of pain even after a week or more of bedrest should also be reported to the orthopaedic surgeon. Traction may be considered if pain becomes intractable. A lumbar brace should be used if absolute bed rest is not possible.  While on bedrest, frequent change of posture and use of air mattress is advisable to prevent pressure sores. DVT stocking should be used to prevent Deep vein thrombosis and consequent pulmonary embolism. An MRI of lumbosacral spine may also be required if your orthopaedic consultant advices to do so.Finally please consult your orthopaedic doctor and a general surgeon at the earliest.  Continue all current medications. For any further questions, please write back to me directly.Regards,Dr. Kaushik"},{"Patient":"I AM DIABETIC FOR THE LAST 8 YEARS I AM 52 YEARS - NOT HAVING BP OR HEART PROBLEMS - NOW GETTING SOME BACK PAINS AND PAIN AT KNEE JOINTS - I HAVE BEEN PRESCRIBED WITH FOLLOWING DRUGS - DIAPRIDE PLUS 1-0-1 FIABTOR 10 MG AT NIGHT AND PIOSYS 7.5MG AT NIGHT AFTER FOOD - MY TRYGLECERIDES LEVEL IS 512 AND CHOLESTROL LEVEL IS 262 KINDLY ADVICE ME PRESENT DRUGS SUITS ME OR NOT - MY FBS IS BETWEEN 100 TO 135 AND AFTER FOOD IT IS 140 TO 175 AT PRESENT","Doctor":"No, Diapride is glinepiride.

Next, I would like to say that your back pain may be mechanical or may be due to degenerative disease of spine. Looking at your age, knee joint pain associated with back pain, I think you may have osteoarthritis or some form of degenerative disease.Imaging of the spine and knee is needed to identify the line of management.  For the time being you may have Paracetamol tablet 500 mg for pain releif (avoid 2nd dose within 6 hrs) till further diagnosis.

Sciatica refers to pain that radiates along the path of the sciatic nerve — which branches from your lower back through your hips and buttocks and down each leg. Typically, sciatica affects only one side of your body. Although the pain associated with sciatica can be severe, most cases resolve with just conservative treatments in a few weeks.MRI is needed to establish the cause of sciatica, so that appropriate treatment can be prescribed. Sciatica do respond well to bed rest and analgesics (pain killer) and is right mode of treatment. The definitive treatment depends upon the cause of sciatica. I would suggest you to consult an orthopediac surgeon who may order MRI to determine cause of sciatica (level and degree in case of disc herniation) and may suggest other mode of treatment. After initial few days of bed rest, you needs physiotherapy (exercises).I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"Hi I am a fit 49 yr woman .

The spinal canal is guarded by the vertebrae which separated from one another by a cushion like intervertebral discs. With age, degenerative changes occur which leads to disc prolapse and spinal cord/nerve root compression.These degenerative changes are not completely reversible but the further progression of these changes can be retarded with medical treatment and regular physiotherapy exercises.Usually the treatment goes in following lines: rest, lifestyle modifications (namely- avoiding pillow while sleeping, following a healthy diet plan, maintaining suitable posture while working on computer/driving, avoiding any activity that strikes neck discomfort), medications (that your physician prescribes) and most important physiotherapy ( in form of neck exercises, cervical traction if required along with local ultrasonics).I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"hi im denis joy from kerala.im suffering severe low back pain.im not able to sit without chair and i cant bend or do any activities depend on back pain.doctor said it's disc problem but im not sure.im only 17 years old.im so desp now.what should i do.please help.please.....","Doctor":"HiThank you for asking HCMI have gone through your query.Your problem is most likely due to lumbar disc herniation.A physical examination with an Orthopedician will give clue for that and an X ray followed by MRI if needed should be done to confirm that.For my patients with such condition i advise muscle relaxants like Thiocolchicoside NSAIDs like Aceclofenac and neurotropic drugs.I send them to physiotherapy along with this.Wearing a supporting belt is also helpful.If no improvement after this then a surgical correction can be considered.Hope this may help you.Let me know if you have any further query."},{"Patient":"I am having constant aching pain in my lower back which is causing tingling to my lower legs.

Sciatica refers to pain that radiates along the path of the sciatic nerve — which branches from your lower back through your hips and buttocks and down each leg. Typically, sciatica affects only one side of your body. Although the pain associated with sciatica can be severe, most cases resolve with just conservative treatments in a few weeks.MRI is needed to establish the cause of sciatica, so that appropriate treatment can be prescribed. Sciatica do respond well to bed rest and analgesics (pain killer) and is right mode of treatment. The definitive treatment depends upon the cause of sciatica. I would suggest you to consult an orthopediac surgeon who may order MRI to determine cause of sciatica (level and degree in case of disc herniation) and may suggest other mode of treatment. After initial few days of bed rest, you needs physiotherapy (exercises).Hope this helps you. Let me know if you have any more concern."},{"Patient":"hi doc....i frequently hav pail in my lower back with pain going in 1 or both legs.....docs say its because of spasm.....my xray shows loss of lordosis.....i work on daily basis after goin on NUCOXIA MR or ACCLOFENAC with PARACETAMOL but this time pain is not goin. i m 35yrs of female with a sitting job of 4-5hrs on compters. 1st time pain was on left side which setteled with anti spam medicine within 4 days......after 1 week, pain was on right side as if i got som muscele pulled....pain went to 1 leg.....again i got releved with MR within 6days........i again got the pain after 15days  dat is now & i m not gettin relieved even aftr 15days.....HELP","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for writing to usThe low back ache is a result of muscle spasm which in itself is a protective mechanism body develops so that the back avoids abnormal posture. For pain to go, it takes not only rest (on a comfortable bed) but also avoidance of particular positions (during work, rest or recreation).Avoid sleeping on sides and stomach in case you do. While on work don't sit in one position for more than an hour and take frequent stretch breaks. Do not bend forward to lift things up, bend the knees and hips for that. Also discontinue any strenuous activity or exercises for some time.Having said that, you might want to consult your orthopaedician for a detailed physical examination and appropriate investigations. It might help with few medications and physiotherapy for a few days. Physiotherapy particularly lumbar traction for a week and back strengthening exercises after pain relief work well.Hope this helps you.

It may be due to : -Tummy tonsils- meaning enlargement of the lymph nodes of the abdomen.-Appendicitis- by default this has to be ruled out in every case of pain in -abdomen of a child.-Worms.The best diagnosis is a high resolution ultrasonography. some blood, urine and stool tests.A therapeutic trial with a course of an antibiotic, metronidazole and probiotics under the guidance of a pediatrician / Surgeon always helps to solve the problem and to get a diagnosis.Also given is a dose of medicines active against worms in intestine.I hope a consultation with a Pediatric Surgeon, investigations and a course of an antibiotic and metronidazole should solve the problem.If this is indicative of appendicitis , please go for the surgery of appendectomy."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am having back pain (both sides of the lower spine) for the last few months. I had visited a doctor today and he asked me to lift one leg and both legs while lying on my back and asked me if I had pain. I did not feel much pain. So he said no x ray is needed, it may be due to less strength of the lower back and suggested leg raises exercises every day along with Etova-P 400 (1 morning and 1 night). Is this tablet a pain killer? if so, I feel the pain for me is still bearable and I do not need a pain killer. Also, advise me on my condition. Thanks,Krishna","Doctor":"Welcome to healthcare magic! What your doctor has done is known as straight leg raising test . As the test is negative means your nerve roots are not getting pressed. So its most likely mechanical low backache. Etova-P is NSAID drug which reduces prostaglandin and thus inflammation and not just a pain killer. So even though pain is tolerable , you should take course as suggested by doctor. But the most important thing for you is exercise daily. Consult physiotherapist for exercises and other modalities like SWD/IFT. Exercise regularly. If you are overweight, reduce your weight. Stretch your body. Avoid prolonged sitting or standing. Learn proper work postures."},{"Patient":"Sir, I have been advised by my Ortho doctor to take Ubicar one tablet a day for 30 days due to back pain.

This medicine should not cause any side effects in the dose you have mentioned. But at the same time, will not be of much use to relieve your backache. The most important thing to deal with backache is your exercise. Learn exercises from physiotherapist to improve tone of your abdominal muscles. DO back exercises because most of the time its mechanical backache. Focus on your posture. Avoid prolonged sitting. Stretching exercises should be done at regular interval. If you are overweight, reduce your weight. Sometimes stress is contributor, so practice stress management techniques like yoga/meditation."},{"Patient":"I have been experiencing a soreness in the tip of my tailbone for months now, just recently I have been experiencing a burning sensation in my lower back and a grabbing in my buttocks and right leg hamstring.

I was getting over a cold when this happened, but I'm not sure if I feel awful because of the cold or if something internally is wrong now.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for posting your concern in the HCM. From the history, I think PIVD should be ruled out. You can have a Xray of Dorsal and LS spine to rule out any bony abnormality and change in disk space.  If the radiating pain persists you will also need MRI of the affected region of the spine. For the time being you can have analgesics ( tab paracetamol 500 mg sos, at least 6 hr interval should be maintained), a muscle relaxant (Cyclobenzaprine 15 mg or Thiocolchicoside 4 mg twice daily) and rest.These are for symptomatic relief. For definitive management you should have the imaging done and consult your local Orthopaedic surgeon. Requirement of conservative management or surgery will be decided by him.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, I would advise you if you eat frequently from outside specially spicy, fried and fast food kind of eatables. Such food could bring on intestinal infections, and also the intestinal mucosa could be sensitive to some of the components of the food. In both the case, you could get such symptoms in your abdomen. So avoid it and include enough roughage and liquids to your daily routine food at home. I would also advise you to get a routine stool test done for ova and cyst, and also a urine routine and microscopic test to rule out both intestinal and urinary infections, and treat these if found positive. This might relieve you of your symptoms.On the general medicinal part, I would advise you go for a proton pump inhibitor along with a prokinetic drug, and a probiotic which would an additional help in treating your symptoms. In case all these fail, I would advise you for an ultrasound whole abdomen to rule out chances of any gall stone disease, and if need be, would refer to a gastroenterologist for a possible endoscopic evaluation of your intestinal tract.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

A herniated disc in the lumbar region will not cause pain in the ribs. The dermatomal distribution is different.Neither will it cause any pain in the neck. Radiating pain in the lower extremity may come from a pathology in the lumbar spine. . I think you should have clinical examination of entire spine. Cervical spondylosis or any other abnormality in the C spine may produce radiating neck and/or upper back pain. Rib tenderness may occur due to several conditions including diseases in the lung, mediastinum or pleura. Bony pathology and fibromyalgia should also be ruled out.

Currently walking with minimal pain. However, lower back sore to touch. Can now bend a little further and twist. Couldn't do that at first. What is the difference between herniated disc and muscle strain/tear?","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for posting your concern in the HCM. Muscle sprain and herniated disc are completely different problems. Herniated disc is a vertebral problem in which the soft central substance ( disc) between the vertebral body, which acts as shock absorber and also prevents friction, herniates out through a tear in annulus fibrosus. On the other hand musle sprain in simple injury to the muscle fibres. MRI of the spine can well illustrate a herniated disc. Although the local symptoms are similar, disc herniation may produce radicular pain, numbness, tingling in the supplied dermatome which is absent in muscle injury. Surgical management is often required for back pain due to herniated disc while in case of back muscle sprain it is usually managed conservatively. The initial treatment prescribed to you for your symptoms is appropriate. However, further examination and possibly imaging will be required after consulting an orthopaedic surgeon to rule out a herniated disc. For any further questions please write back to us. Regards.

Sharon Bare /","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for your query.You might be suffering from Acute mechanical back pain.1. Hard bed rest for 2-3 days2. Take some muscle relaxants like myoril 8 mg, etc., along with pain killers like diclofenac 50mg. You can continue using volini spray.3. Hot water fomentation to back 2-3 times a day4. Physiotherapy - Interferential therapy (IFT) to your back will help you relieve the pain5. Avoid driving, leaning forward, sitting for prolonged time or lifting heavy weights. These activities can increase your back pain.Even after a week if your pain doesn't gets relieved, better to get yourself examined by an orthopaedician. He might ask you to take an Xray of your backI do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"ive been having lower back pain for several months continuously, ive been to my GP for 3 times already but all he does is give me pain releiver which is not helping. i work as a care assistant and im afraid i might have hurt my back,, is it possible that i may have had a slip disc?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for your query.You seem to have a prolapsed inter vertebral disc. This disc may be compressing upon a nerve root that either exits or traverses through that level. Having known this basic anatomy, you must avoid any activity that aggravates the condition, like bending forward and lifting heavy objects, sitting long hours on computer, inappropriate sitting posture, etc.The medications will relieve pain and help muscles to relax. should Physiotherapy shall also help a lot, especially exercises that strengthen your back. Kindly note that exercises only be done when it doesn't hurt. Adequate rest and proper nutrition is equally important. Drink lots of fluids since dehydration affects the disc. May be its time you need an MRI done to have a diagnosis established. With that one can formulate a definitive treatment plan.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"I am having localized minimal discomfort on the left side of my stomach approximately 2/3 fingers from navel, and 2/3 fingers below navel.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.With the history of IBS, and several abdominal surgeries (?reason), I would consider a routine stool test for ova and cyst and treat it if positive, and in case of no relief, might consider sending you to a gastro enterologist for an endoscopic evaluation (colonsocopy) of your intestinal tract, and possibly an ultrasound abdomen to rule out any intra abdominal organ pathology. As this was not an intolerable discomfort or pain, I would not consider for any medications till the reports of investigations were at hand which would decide on further management.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Immediately consulted a Sr.Ortho and was hospitalised for pelvic treatment.  I did undergo physiotherapy and traction for six days.  Now the pain is considerably subsided.  I have some queries regarding the dos and donts. 1.  Is two wheeler riding considered a total ban in my case.  I am wearing a belt on doctors recommendation. 2.Is climbing steps a ban in my case.

Sciatica refers to pain that radiates along the path of the sciatic nerve — which branches from your lower back through your hips and buttocks and down each leg. Typically, sciatica affects only one side of your body. Although the pain associated with sciatica can be severe, most cases resolve with just conservative treatments in a few weeks.MRI is needed to establish the cause of sciatica, so that appropriate treatment can be prescribed. Sciatica do respond well to bed rest and analgesics (pain killer) and is right mode of treatment.

Sometimes the pain radiates down my buttock to my left leg, and other times it just becomes stiff.  It almost always feels tight and spasms.  I also have a large lump adjacent to my spine that sticks out from the left side.  It is kind of hard, but spongy..and if I push in on it too hard, it radiates pain.

During the day don't sit in one position for more than an hour and take frequent stretch breaks. Do not bend forward to lift things up, bend the knees and hips for that. Also discontinue any strenuous activity or exercises for some time.I suggest you to try back strengthening exercises by extension of the back muscles which can be taught by your Physiotherapist. This will help to relieve the possible muscle spasm which causes the pain. You may go for a physical examination by your Orthopedician to rule out any spine related pathology. You may be prescribed pain killers and/or muscle relaxants which should give you relief. Physiotherapy may also be advised if necessary.

After marriage I have severe stomach/abdominal pain where I cannot even move. i just bend downwards holding my stomach-- even breathing becomes very difficult. I have one advil pill and it eases the pain in 20 mins... is it normal? I have come across this situation twice. First time i got scared and went to ER. They took some tests and provided a report stating everything is normal. But am confused here.Can you please help?","Doctor":"Hi! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. With your history of getting abdominal pain of such severity after marriage, I could think of either a resistant UTI (urinary tract infection) or a PID (pelvic inflammatory disease). If I were your doctor, I would advise you for a routine and microscopic test of urine followed by a culture and sensitivity test and treat it if positive. The PID could be diagnosed by a gynaecological examination and a vaginal swab culture and sensitivity test. Apart from this, a general abdominal examination along with an ultrasound of abdomen would be required to rule out any other intra abdominal pathology. Till then, I would advise you with an anti spasmodic along with a proton pump inhibitor drug for a symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery.

Since then it has been getting only worse, and is almost to the point of being debilitating. It has also spread from the right side of my back to the top half of my back. I noticed that if I curve my body forwards, it causes a sharp pain, and a weak feeling in my spine. The pain didn't start with an injury or and specific action, instead it started when I was typing my essay in my computer chair. I often sit in this chair for long periods of time without problems. Although I did notice my posture was slightly more hunched than normal. I doubt age, or arthritis could be part of the problem, because I am only 15, and in good health. I go to the gym nearly every day, and do fairly intense work outs, however, the day the pain began, I did not go to the gym, nor did I the preceding day. I went today and did an unusually intense work out, and for about an hour after the work out, the pain had stopped. However it soon came back, full force. I doubt this could have much to do with my condition, but yesterday was the first day I began taking my Adderall prescription. I know this is unhealthy, but also, since I started my prescription at 8 AM yesterday, I've eaten nothing and all I had eaten prior to taking my adderall were a few tortilla chips. I wasn't trying to starve myself, just the aderall makes it extremely difficult to eat.

Any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for your query.It seems that your increase in weight; wrong body posture; inadequate exercise and reduced muscle tone is taking a toll on your back. For pain to go, it takes not only rest (on a comfortable bed) but also avoidance of particular positions (during work, rest or recreation).During the day don't sit in one position for more than an hour and take frequent stretch breaks. Do not bend forward to lift things up, bend the knees and hips for that. Also discontinue any strenuous activity or exercises for some time.I suggest you to try back strengthening exercises by extension of the back muscles which can be taught by your Physiotherapist. This will help to relieve the possible muscle spasm which causes the pain. You may go for a physical examination by your Orthopedician to rule out any spine related pathology. You may be prescribed pain killers and/or muscle relaxants which should give you relief. Physiotherapy may also be advised if necessary. I would suggest you to try swimming as this will help most in back conditions.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"Sudden back pain while lifting a gas cylinder.

Sciatica refers to pain that radiates along the path of the sciatic nerve — which branches from your lower back through your hips and buttocks and down each leg. Typically, sciatica affects only one side of your body. Although the pain associated with sciatica can be severe, most cases resolve with just conservative treatments in a few weeks.MRI is needed to establish the cause of sciatica, so that appropriate treatment can be prescribed. Sciatica do respond well to bed rest and analgesics (pain killer) and is right mode of treatment. The definitive treatment depends upon the cause of sciatica. I would suggest you to consult an orthopediac surgeon who may order MRI to determine cause of sciatica (level and degree in case of disc herniation) and may suggest other mode of treatmentI do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"hi i am 55 years old lady weighing 75kgs. i have severe upper and lower back pain extending it to right thigh. my MRI report says i have L5-s1 disc shows posterior bulgee with a postero central herniation mildly indenting both traversing s1 nerve roots right more than left. please suggest cure. thanks.","Doctor":"Hi...what u have is intervertebral disc prolapse at L5-S1 level.MRI shows posterior bulge which a early stages of prolapse.things to do.1) bed Rest for 3 days.2)Avoid lifting weights, bending down, squatting.3)Take pain killer( diclofenac 50mg twice a day)4) physiotherapy- most heat, TENS and once the pain subside then start physiotherapy to strengthen the core back muscle and abdominal muscle.5) If the pain doesn't subside in first 6 months with medication then steroid injection can be taken.6) if the pain persists even after steroid injection and if the radiating pain is more than back pain then surgery(disc removal) is the next options.As of now start on non surgical management and physiotherapy the pain will subside."},{"Patient":"A couple of days ago I bent over to pick up a screw and I heard a pop in my lower back, since then I have had a sore back and especially bending and getting up from a sitting position.

I went to work 3 days after a car accident in 2008. I was assisting with an installation of a custom built in refrigerator when I notice a severe pain in my lower back. I was diagnosed with two bulging discs and now a bone spur as well. At the time of the original injury I suffered pain throughout my body. Nerves in my back, and neck felt like needles sticking when I sneezed. Upper thighs and legs were numb. My testes were very painful and lymph nodes in my hands , at my lower back, and near my groan area were swollen and paining. Pain shot from my left side of my lower back to the groan and testes. Since 2008 this subsided after about 10 months of little or no lifting. When I began to lift heavy items again the pain returned and now there are two masses in my scrotum area outside of my testes . This is one of the same areas where the pain was previously most intense. Many issues are now coming up including swelling in my left leg at the knee and a walnut size knot in the same area. What doctor should I see first and what tests should I have done?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for your query.I understand you have back pain . These symptoms are part of lumbar disc degeneration with PIVD where the nerves get compressed by the protruded disc. you must avoid any activity that aggravates the condition, like bending forward and lifting heavy objects, sitting long hours on computer, inappropriate sitting posture, etc.There are several treatment modalities with medicines, physiotherapy and with injections in the back called epidural injections and root/facet blocks.If you dont get better with these treatment ,I suggest you undergo surgery, by which the nerves are decompressed by removing the protruded disc (discectomy), which would significantly improve your symptomsI do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"I had back muscle spasm last week. Went to the chiropractor and he helped my back pain, but since then I have been having some pain still in my back but the most uncomfortable pain is in my right arm, up into my neck and collar bone. I noticed the pain seemed to be going to a spot on my collar bone area, I then noticed a lump on the right side.","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for your query.The low back ache is a result of muscle spasm which in itself is a protective mechanism body develops so that the back avoids abnormal posture. For pain to go, it takes not only rest (on a comfortable bed) but also avoidance of particular positions (during work, rest or recreation).Avoid sleeping on sides and stomach in case you do. While on work don't sit in one position for more than an hour and take frequent stretch breaks. Do not bend forward to lift things up, bend the knees and hips for that. Also discontinue any strenuous activity or exercises for some time.Having said that, you might want to consult your orthopaedician for a detailed physical examination and appropriate investigations. It might help with few medications and physiotherapy for a few days. Physiotherapy particularly lumbar traction for a week and back strengthening exercises after pain relief work well.Remember that medicines usually don't play a role in long term treatment, what does is exercises.

I was recently in a wreck an have been having back problems due to the wreck. I have been going to a physical therapist to help my back and neck get better. This past Wednesday I went to my physical therapist to do exercises I normally do there and my neck and back were hurting a little bit. We stopped doing neck exercises because it was hurting. I did a back exercise and noticed it hurt to do it so he had me not do so many. I didn't hurt right when I left there but when I went into work later that day I started having bad lower back pain and both sides of my abdomen have been hurting badly. The past two days it has hurt to walk and do stuff at work and nothing seems to make it feel better. I am not sure if I am having muscle problems or if it has to do with me being a little lactose intolerant. What could be causing my pains?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for your query.There are numerous causes and conditions that produce neck pain as well as back pain. An MRI scan of the concerned spinal columns will help in establishing the proper diagnosis. I suggest you not make any delay in approaching a doctor as it is definitely abnormal to have neurological problems with weakness in the limbs at your age.The treatment for your problem will depend on the condition diagnosed. Generally, with early diagnosis and early treatment, one can expect favourable outcome after treatment. Temporarily, please follow the below mentioned measures to get some symptomatic relief -- avoid any movements that produces pain- do not use bulky pillow underneath your head while sleeping as this position will produce more compression of the nerves- Use a Soft collar which allow the muscles of the neck to rest and limit neck motion. This can help decrease pinching of nerve roots with movement. Soft collars should only be worn for short periods of time, because long-term wear can decrease the strength of neck muscles.- Analgesic (diclofenac & lornoxicam) and muscle relaxant (thiocolchicoside) combination medicines will provide symptomatic relief from pain & muscle spasm. Neurotropic vitamins like METHYLCOBALAMINE (activated Vit B12) or PREGABALIN will help in alleviating the neuropathic pain.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"how can i stop back pain?

Sciatica refers to pain that radiates along the path of the sciatic nerve — which branches from your lower back through your hips and buttocks and down each leg. Typically, sciatica affects only one side of your body. Although the pain associated with sciatica can be severe, most cases resolve with just conservative treatments in a few weeks.MRI is needed to establish the cause of sciatica, so that appropriate treatment can be prescribed. Sciatica do respond well to bed rest and analgesics (pain killer) and is right mode of treatment. The definitive treatment depends upon the cause of sciatica. I would suggest you to consult an orthopediac surgeon who may order MRI to determine cause of sciatica (level and degree in case of disc herniation) and may suggest other mode of treatment. After initial few days of bed rest, you needs physiotherapy (exercises).I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"I AM A 51 YR.

Do not stay off your feet for longer, though.- Avoid lifting weights as it imparts more strain on your back- Change your daily activities so that you avoid movements that can cause further pain, especially bending forward and lifting as it will worsen the intervertebral disc problems. if you want to bend forwards, do it with your hips and knees flexed.- Use a lumbosacral back support to stabilize your spinal muscles and to provide support for your spinal column.- After the initial pain has subsided, remedial exercises to strengthen the spine are very important to restore normal spinal movements and muscle strength. The main aim of exercise is to encourage mobility, reduce muscle spasm, prevent further deterioration in the muscles and speed recovery.- You should maintain an optimum body weight to decrease the strain on your vertebral column causing more degeneration and arthritic changes.- At times, spinal steroid injections and Facet blocks will help in alleviating the lower back pain.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"ovulation?

Specific points as it radiates down are: 1. The point of origin of pain 2. My right hand triceps 3. My elbow 4. Outer side of my forearm (Non palm side) 5. Non Palm side 6. Base of the ring finger The pain gradually increases after I sit down for about 5 minutes, I get a lot of relief if I stand and bend backwards. The pain also decreases a bit when I sit but keep my back straight / a little bended backward. When I type, I feel the strain near my elbow, ring finger and outer side of my forearm. I used to be a very active sports man during my schooling / college days, but once I started working (about 8 years), physical activity has taken a back seat and is very random. About 2 months back, I joined a cricket team and used to bowl for about 2 hours a day over weekends (Which I suppose could have strained my muscles). I remember not having warmed up / stretched well before bowling. With all these symptoms, I had consulted two orthopedics; one of them had got two X-rays done of my neck / upper back and had also conducted basic checks. Both the X-rays revealed no abnormalities to the neck bone, back bone or discs; neither have the checks revealed any abnormalities. Both the doctors concluded that it was a case of ‘some nerve / muscle’ that has got strained and is what is causing the problem. The strain, as the doctors mentioned could have been due to bowling / any strenuous activity, incorrect posture and working style. I have also been told that my weight could be adding to my woes. I was advised to go to a Physiotherapist for about 7 days (IFT and Ultra sound) for the back and arm and was advised to take painkiller tablet and a muscle relaxant tablet.

Diagnosis can be confirmed by upper G I endoscopy . Try raising the head of your bed about 4 inches with block. It might also help to avoid eating or drinking for 2 hours before you lie down.

I'd advice you to take an antacid also as Diclofenac may likely cause acidity. If the pain is bothering too much, you might need operative intervention too, which your treating doctor will be able to decide rightly after looking into your scans. Hope this answers your query.

Since the pain shoots when u move your arm , it is most probably muscular in origin (myalgia) which may be due to paraspinal spasm ( happens due to muscle strain ). We usually use the term spondylitis ( and not arthritis )when it is related to spine.
