This has been happening for some time now and when I talk to my doctor she doesn t really help me. I noticed this pain started happening when I ate greasy foods. I know I have a poor diet which is why when this first started happening I tried changing my habits, but no change. The people I have spoken to about it suggested it is a problem with my gallbladder? When I brought this up to my doctor she asked my to write down foods it happened with. And I don t feel like Ive been getting help. In fact I am having chest pain now and it has advanced to sometimes hurting with every beat, palpitations and at times I can sleep at night, discomfort in my neck, back, arm. Trouble breathing sometimes. I also have experienced sharp pains in my side I do not know what to do","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) due to your poor eating habits and stress. But better to rule out heart diseases first. So get done ecg. If ecg is normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Stress, anxiety can cause GERD. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of chest pain, burning type. Stress causes palpitations. So better to avoid stress and tension. Be relax and calm. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Take proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drugs. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I started having gas pains in the middle of my chest about a month ago.  I started eating more slowly and only ate half of what I had been eating as I am obese.  However, the chest pain continues and often is 2-3 hours after I eat or before I have eaten anything, such as in the morning.  So my question is how to tell if it's gas or a heart condition such as angina?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Honestly speaking, it is very difficult to differentiate between gas pain and heart pain. But heart pain is more severe kind of pain as compare to gas pain. It is basically excruciating type of pain with perspiration, sweating, chest heaviness. Heart pain is also radiating to left jaw, left shoulder and arm. But these classical differences may not seen all the time. Many times, heart patients are complaining of gas pain and it is actually found out to be of heart pain. So better to get done heart work up like ecg, 2d echo and stress test to rule out heart pain. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I know mixing these together are harmful but how harmful?  I am just waiting for him to get to his low so he will accept treatment.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Propranolol is beta blocker. It will cause reduction in blood pressure and heart rate. Alcohol and cocaine, both are CNS depressants (they suppress brain and it's functions). So alcohol and cocaine will also cause hypotension and low pulse rate. So if patient is on propranolol and alcohol and cocaine, chances of hypotension, bradycardia (low pulse rate) and cardiac arrest is more. So better not to take alcohol or cocaine if you are taking propranolol. So counsel your husband to quit alcohol and cocaine because he is taking propranolol. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your husband.

The hemidiaphragms and costophrenic sulci are intact. Impression: Suspicious density, left, Apico-lordotic view is suggested. What does this mean? :(","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Normally,  chest x ray is taken in PA (posteroanterior) view. In this view, many structures in lung apex overlap. Structures like lung tissue, clavicle, ribs etc overlap with each other. So any lesion in lung apex can not be visualized clearly and hence accurate diagnosis can not be made. To overcome this overlapping issue, apico lordotic view is done. In this view, chest x ray is taken in such a way that overlapping of structures can be avoided and hence lesion in apex can be visualized properly. So get done Apico lordotic view topic diagnose suspicious opacity in your x ray. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

He told me the armm pain started last week is he having a heart attact?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Possibility of heart attack is less because he is having right sided shoulder pain while heart related pain is commonly seen in left shoulder. But better to get done ecg and 2d echo. If both are normal then no need to worry for heart attack. Possibility of lung related pain is more because he is having breathlessness also. So get done chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Chest x ray is needed to rule out lung infection. PFT is needed to rule out bronchitis. Both, lung infection and bronchitis, can cause similar symptoms. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Chances of heart attack is very less. Hope I have solved your query.

Does this mean beginning heart failure. EF is 60%. Thanks","Doctor":"Hello sir , pulmonary flow reversal confirms that mitral regurgitation is severe enough that the regurgitation blood is reaching till pulmonary veins ( indirect means suggestive of severe disease on echocardiography  ) . Hereby I would suggest that you don't wait for heart failure to set it , if you have symptoms like breathlessness while you exert , angina and palpitation.  It's better you plan for a elective mitral valve replacement.  Though not urgent would be a good option in view  of long term quality of life .

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, your all symptoms are due to stress and anxiety. But better to first rule out heart diseases because they can cause similar symptoms especially at night. So get done ecg and 2d echo. If both are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. You are mostly having stress and anxiety.

Nevertheless, I would recommend performing some tests in order to investigate for other possible causes that may mimic this clinical situation: - a resting ECG and a cardiac ultrasound- thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction- blood electrolytes for possible imbalance- complete blood count for anemia. An ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring would help investigate for possible cardiac arrhythmia. If all the above tests result normal, you should consider anxiety as the main cause underlying your complaints.

I can understand your concern. Honestly speaking, there is nothing we cannot do at home for his current condition. He needs ICU (intensive care unit) admission, continuous cardiac monitoring, diuretic and other cardiac supportive drugs. All these are not possible at home. If you want to treat him at home only then very few drugs we can give. You can give him digoxin. It incteases force of contraction of heart. But it is very toxic drug with many side effects.

Yes, stress and anxiety can cause similar symptoms. But better to first rule out arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) and other heart diseases for your symptoms because you are having hypotension.

Stress, anxiety and panic attacks are the biggest risk factors for uncontrolled hypertension. So we should first treat your panic attacks to achieve blood pressure control. For this, better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Along with drugs, counselling plays very important role in control of panic attacks.Once you anxiety and panic attacks are controlled, your blood pressure will also reduce.

About a month ago, I was 140/90 and was put on a blood pressure pill and a week ago on a small diuretic. Since starting to take the diuretic, my body temperature has been 95.7 to 97.5. Been very weak. My doctor feels I picked up a bug and just coincidence since just starting the diurectic. Should I be concerned over the lower blood pressure, lower body temp., weakness etc.?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Blood pressure of 122/70 mmhg is not considered as low. It is normal blood pressure. In my opinion, your low temperature and weakness are mostly due to diuretic drug. Diuretic causes excessive urination. So this can cause low sodium level. And this can cause weakness and lower body temperature. So if you are maintaining normal blood pressure without diuretic drug then ask your doctor to stop diuretic drug and continue blood pressure pill only. No need to take diuretic if you are achieving 122/70 mmhg of blood pressure with pressure pill only. You will mostly improve after stopping diuretic drug. So discuss all these with your doctor and plan accordingly. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I am 55 yrs old.

Been in menopause for 3 years, and have gained weight, especially upper stomach.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Visible pulsations in neck area are due to raised JVP (jugular venous pressure). And raised JVP can be due to heart and lung diseases. Since heart diseases have been ruled out, we should search for Pulmonary causes. You are having sleep apnea and smoking cigarettes too. So this can cause Pulmonary hypertension and bronchitis. And both these can cause palpitations and raised JVP. So get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) and 2d echo for the diagnosis of these diseases. Better to quit smoking as soon as possible.

What happened.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, there are two possibilities. 1. Simple partial seizures. 2. Arrhythmias. So better to first consult neurologist and get done MRI brain and EEG (electroencephalogram) to rule out seizure. Consult cardiologist and get done ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hour continuous monitoring of ecg). You may need anti epileptic and anti arrhythmia drugs on the basis of above reports.

I checked his BP and it is SYS 134; Dia 74 and his pulse rate was 82. The last checkup with family Cardiologist was three months back. Please advise.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Your father's blood pressure and heart rate is normal. So heart related causes are unlikely for his shivering. Shivering of the body is commonly associated with fever and infections in urine, stomach and lungs. Shivering is also commonly seen with malaria and dengue. So better to consult doctor and get done complete blood count (CBC), tests for malaria and dengue, chest x ray, ultrasound examination of abdomen and Urinary microscopic examination to find out the cause of shivering. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your father.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having funnel shaped chest. It is inward deviation of sternum bone. Most common cause for this is calcium and vitamin d 3 deficiency. So first of all get done calcium and vitamin d 3 levels and if Deficiency than you may need supplements. If deformity is severe then surgical correction is also needed. But for this, you need to first consult orthopedic and spine surgeon. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Sometimes they go away for a long amount of time like a month but then they come back and it s like whenever I exhale, I get this sharp pain in the left side of my chest like my heart is being squeezed and it s hard to breathe because it really hurts and it usually lasts about 1-3 minutes. Should I start seeking medical attention as soon as possible? What could be wrong?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, you should definitely definitely get done few reports to rule out heart and lung related causes for your chest pain. You are having squeezing type of chest pain on exhalation. This is seen in heart diseases like coronary heart disease and lung diseases like pleurisy, pneumonia etc. So get done ecg, 2d echo, chest x ray. If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart and lung related causes. Sometimes, musculoskeletal pain can cause similar symptoms. So avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Take painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs. Don't worry, you will be alright. First rule heart and lung related causes. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

I can understand your concern. You are having diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia. All these are risk factors for heart, kidney, liver and brain diseases. It is good that you are asymptomatic at present with all these diseases. But these are chronic diseases and if not treated promptly, they can cause chronic diseases to above mentioned organs. On long run, these diseases can cause chronic heart failure, coronary artery disease, renal failure, brain hemorrhage, ischemia etc. So better to consult doctor and start treatment to avoid future life threatening complications.

Im 16 and have never smoked or done any drugs. whats up with that?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of heart block is more. In this, due to conduction block, impulse can not travel from atria to ventricle and hence heart skips that beat. So blood supply is also impaired. If this episode stays long, blood supply to the body is reduced for long time and hence you feel weakness, dizziness, light headedness etc. It is commonly seen in young individuals, so we should first rule out heart block in your case. So better to consult cardiologist and get done ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hour continuous monitoring of ecg) fir the diagnosis of heart block. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Heart sometimes feels like it skips a beat and you get pin and needles in the legs. Best way to describe the feeling is that of a bicycle wheel, and when you throw something in the wheel it stops before the object is out the other side and your wheel goes on as usual.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Irregular heart beats is commonly seen with cardiac arrhythmias. And this can cause pins and needle sensations in the body. So better to consult cardiologist and get done ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hour continuous monitoring of ecg). If all these are normal then no need to worry arrhythmia. Vitamin b 12 deficiency can also cause similar symptoms. So get done vitamin b 12 level and if Deficiency than you may need supplements. Don't worry, you will be alright. But first rule out arrhythmia. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of angina pain and early heart failure is more. Uncontrolled hypertension commonly causes heart failure. And this causes fluid retention, pulmonary edema. This inturn causes breathlessness, chest pain and tightness. So immediately consult cardiologist and get done 1. Ecg 2. 2 d echo. 3. Stress test (trade mill test). 4. If required, Coronary angiography. You may need diuretic drugs, antihypertensive and other cardiac supportive drugs.

Yes, you should definitely consult cardiologist and get done reports for the diagnosis of type of arrhythmia. Arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, supra ventricular tachycardia etc can cause hypotension during irregular heart beats. And this hypotension can cause dizziness, headache, blocked vision etc. So get done ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hour continuous monitoring of ecg) for the diagnosis of type of arrhythmia. You will need anti arrhythmia drug on the basis of these reports. Don't worry, with proper diagnosis and treatment, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query.

I can understand your concern. His pain is mostly due to neuritic and neuropathic pain. It is common in stroke patients. It is actually due to regeneration of nerves in paralyzed parts of body. It is positive sign for recovery. His pain will improve with pregabalin or gabapentin. Both are having excellent effect in neuritic pain. Vitamin b 12, folic acid and pyridoxine supplements along with pregabalin are also beneficial. So consult doctor and discuss about starting these drugs. Don't worry, he will be alright.

Am going through lot of anxiety..wll anxiety cause increase in triglycerides?","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that anxiety is not related to high levels of triglycerides. High levels of triglycerides are usually related to your diet and low physical activity. Alcohol intake can lead to increased triglyceride levels. Your triglyceride levels have decreased because of Tonact TG therapy. But if you stop it, they will probably raise again. I recommend making some diet modifications (mediterranian diet, fish, olive oil, nuts and avoid fat and sugar) and a lot of physical activity. After these lifestyle modifications you can discuss with your doctor on the possibility of reducing the dose of Tonact TG.

I could finally be drifting off to sleep, then suddenly my Heart gives off a hard pump and wakes me up for a while. I have also been having pain in the area of my ribs, and deal with this daily. I have Winter Asthma, and recently I ve had to take the larger solution two to three times a day, and its usually because I ve been feeling weaker and numb in worrying areas, like the back of my skull, over my face, and in parts of my body. I ve delt with Acute Bronchitis recently and Acute Sinusitis, and those seemed to have gone, but my condition has gotten worse. Like, how yesterday, there was a large numbness all over most of my skull/brain, but after taking the solution, it went away and my body felt better, somewhat. This all started around a month ago, when we though it was just a cold or the flu. Then in the second week, I got Bronchitis and all those other things, the third week Ibwas getting better then had to go to the ER, and now its the fourth week and Im getting worse... I think my body isn t generating enough blood, and my body makes me take the solution to help my heart pump and send out more blood throughout my body. I have been taking 2 peptobismo chewbles a day, one in the morning, one at night, to help with acid reflux, and three Bayer s chewable asprins everynight, to help with rib and heart pain, and it worked for a while, but now its just nothing. I have also been getting ice cold on the inside, but hot on the outside. Breathing is so-so but its alright, but the pain in my ribs and heart hurt horribly everyday multiple times a day. I have also been somewhat stressing and may be gaining anxiety recently from all this, as I have never been sick this badly, so it s all new to me, and I had to go to the ER from an allergic reaction to a type of penicillin a week and two days ago, and this severe pain only started recently, on Jan. 29. The ER had given me Benadryl and a Cortiosteriod (May have miss spelt that) when I was there, and gave me more benadryl Take for 10 days as needed for allergy symptoms and I don t know if it meant I had to take them for 10 days, or when I had allergy symptoms. They gave me some more cortiosteroids to take two days after on Jan. 28. I did, and had a horrible pain attack that night, so I set up an appointment with my doctor on the 29. I went, and he ignored basically everything pain wise and didn t know about anything that was happening. In the car, the entire roof of my mouth was blue. Its been getting better from that, but its still slightly blue down the middle. I did a few errands, and by the time I got home, I was in so much pain, and then proceeded to have an asthma attack. Then ever since then, I had to take the solution once everyday, and the last 2-3 days I have had to take it more than one, ranging from twice to three times. I have tried exercising the past three/four days, where I go outside for a few minutes (5-10, really) and that really makes me feel better, but it always causes me to need the solution an hour or two afterwards. I also believe I am loosing large amounts of weight, which is slightly terrifying to me. I weighed myself early and as my normal weight was 180lbs before all this (The sickness has been going on for over a month now.) and I was 165lbs. I drink around 2-3 bottles of water a day, eat soup, a turkey and cheese sandwhich, some eggs and swiss cheese scrambled together with a tortillia and then bananas. Since I ve been having acid reflux, I stop eating large solid foods at 7pm, and stop eating in general and getting ready for bed around 10pm, but if I do feel extremely hungry (Which I ve been having problems with recently aswell) I eat a banana or some crackers. (Very few though, as I had a horrible reaction with acid reflux recently (When the heart palputations started, really) and thats also when I started getting really sicker and was pale yesterday,and in so much pain I almost fainted. I am going to go to the Doctor s in a few minutes today actually, and we re going to see what he says, maybe do an x-ray to see if I broke a rib, a blood test, to see if I have anything, like cancer, or low blood sugar/ High blood pressure/ anemia. So, If you nees to know anything more, tell me in the email or whatever you are going to send me, and I ll tell you and what the doctor will say.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should first be relax and calm. Get done ecg, chest x and 2d echo to rule out heart and lung diseases. If all these these are normal then no need to worry for major diseases. You all symptoms are mostly due to stress and anxiety related GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of chest pain, burning, chest pressure, tightness etc. GERD can also worsen asthma and bronchitis. So we should first control your stress and anxiety to control your GERD. So consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Avoif stress and tension, be relax and calm. Take proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drugs for GERD. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

He is now having chronic high blood pressure symptoms, even though he is currently on high blood pressure medication. Could there be a possible complication with his adrenal gland as a side effect of the interferon treatment, and if so, will it become permanent?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, hypertension is common side effect of interferon treatment. Actually interferon injection acts directly on adrenal glands and damage it permanently. So hypertension caused by interferon treatment is mostly permanent in nature. So he may need higher dose of antihypertensive drug or addition of new antihypertensive drugs to achieve control in high blood pressure. Along with drugs, strict salt restriction in diet and exercise are also needed to control blood pressure. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your husband. Thanks."},{"Patient":"My husband had five heart bypass a year ago. He get a bit breathless if he bend down or doing too much like walking too far or doing too much in the garden what I am worry is that what can I do if he get a heart attack .Can I give him a cps as I am worried about the operation. What if he get very breathless can he use the spray,glycerine try nitrate.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Since he had five bypass operations, his heart functions must have low. So possibility of fluid retention in the body is more. This causes Pulmonary edema (fluid congestion in lungs). This causes breathlessness on exertion. So he is mostly having Pulmonary edema. He need diuretic drugs to prevent fluid retention. Other cardiac supportive drugs like beta blocker, ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors and digoxin are useful in his case. So rays or glycerine nitrate will not help much during breathlessness. Above mentioned drugs will help in preventing breathlessness. So consult cardiologist and discuss about starting these drugs.

In my opinion, you should definitely rush to hospital and rule out heart diseases for your symptoms because 2 weeks time is too much.  You are having high pulse rate, chest tightness, chest pressure (pounding). And all these can be seen in heart diseases like hypertension,  arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) and coronary artery disease. So better to consult emergency room and get done blood pressure monitoring, ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hour continuous monitoring of ecg) time rule out above mentioned heart diseases. Don't worry, you will be alright. First diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. Chronic kidney disease patients are tend to damage their heart in long run. This heart damage will reduce heart functions. So we should give following drugs to reduce heart damage and improve heart functions. 1. Cardio selective beta blocker (metoprolol). This will prevent heart damage. 2. Angiotensine converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor like Enalapril or captopril. This will prevent remodeling of heart tissue. 3. Digoxin. This will improve force of contraction of heart muscles and hence improves heart functions. So discuss about starting these drugs with his cardiologist to improve heart functions.

I can understand your concern. No, these symptoms are not suggestive of heart problem or connected with problem in Stents. Pain in collar bone is more likely due to musculoskeletal pain. GERD is mostly due to stress or drug related gastritis or food related gastritis. So ask her to avoid stress and tension. Give her light food, avoid hot and spicy food. Give her proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drugs for GERD. Apply warm water pad on affected areas for collar bone pain. She can take painkiller if pain is more. Don't worry, she will be alright.

I can understand your concern. No need to worry much because your blood pressure is controlled with current treatment. 130/80 mmhg is normal blood pressure and you are achieving this with minimal dose on antihypertensive drug. So no further additional drugs required four blood pressure control. Along with exercise and diet control, stress management is also very important in hypertensive patients.

In my opinion, your husband should start anti hypertensive drug. His blood pressure reading is not stable, it is increasing. So he is mostly having hypertension. Better to first start low dose antihypertensive drug like amodipine (5mg) or telmisartan (40mg). Along with drugs, strict salt restriction in diet and exercise are also needed to control blood pressure. If he is having stressful life then stress management is also important. So he should immediately start anti hypertensive drug. Get done repeat blood pressure monitoring after 10 days.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

My chest xray report shows \\"unfolding of arch of aorta noted\\". I constantly feel mild chest congestion, no fatigue no pain. My blood pressure is 187/90. Sometimes I experience cramps on the back of my upper thighs. What does this mean? How dangerous is it?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. First degree AV block means there is blockage in conducting impulse from atria and ventricle. This condition is usually benign, not dangerous and not showing any symptoms. But with hypertension, this can cause heart failure. Your blood pressure is not normal. It is very high. So with AV (atrioventricular) block, this can precipitate heart failure. So your chest congestion can be due to early heart failure because of hypertension. So we should first control your hypertension. For this you need to start anti hypertensive drug, strict salt restriction in diet and exercise. Don't worry, with control of blood pressure, your chest discomfort will improve.

From the other hand, a big difference in blood pressure in both arms could be related to arterial stenosis. I recommend consulting with your GP for a careful physical examination and a Doppler ultrasound of the vessels in your arms. An angio-CT scan of the supraaortic vessels would be helpful in the diagnosis of possible arterial stenosis.

In my opinion, you should should avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. This can precipitate heart failure. In your following drugs should be started to improve ejection fraction (EF). 1. Strict control of dyslipidemia. So optimal dose of lipid lowering drugs like atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, finofibrate etc. 2. Low dose beta blocker like metoprolol. It is having cardiac protective role and proven benefit post MI (myocardial ischemia). 3. ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors like enalapril, captopril etc. Same benefit as beta blocker. 4. Digoxin. Increases force of contraction and improves EF. 5. Low dose diuretic to prevent fluid overload. So discuss about starting these drugs with your cardiologist to improve EF. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

And atrial fibrillation can cause thrombosis and embolism. These emboli can travel through blood and lodge in tiny vessels of retina, brain, kidneys etc. When they lodge in retina, they cause decreased blood supply to that part of retina. So retinal ischemia develops. This kind of retinal ischemia can cause visual impairment. So better to consult ophthalmologist and get done retinal angiography to rule out embolism and ischemia.

Yes, poison ivy can cause cardiac complications like arrhythmias (Atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, supra ventricular tachycardia etc). You are having existing mitral prolapse and regurgitation.

Recently, I ve had some anxiety issues. It begun with a general feel of unrest, that something bad would happen to me, elevated heart rate, etc. . I speculate it s due to anxiety, because the ECG showed no particular issues (despite the elevated 150bpm, it was classified as Sinus tachycardia, re-entry type was ruled out). I also had an echocardiogram, and it showed no issues either (no valve issues, doppler showed good blood flow, etc.). Blood tests were also fine (the thyroid hormones too), just a marginally elevated blood sugar value (116mg/dl) - that I think was due to the fact that I had dinner just before, the blood tests were done in the ER, so I did no preparation. And a marginally elevated MPV of the platelets (11,1 fL), platelets otherwise fine (PLT 304 K/μL). I also had a thoracic X-Ray, with normal findings. Recently, I ve noticed that I can see my stomach pulsating according to my heart rate. No feelings of pain, I tried pressing and couldn t feel a lump (but I m no doctor), but I could feel my heart rate when I pressed. I m not thin (1,72cm height, 73kg weight) and I have an amount of fat around my stomach, and the movements of the area are very subtle (I don t feel them, I just can observe them optically). I got worried about an aortic aneurysm. The physician that did my second echocardiogram, he pressed it under the ribcage, so I guess that he probably checked the aorta and thus eliminated a thoracic (at least) aortic aneurysm? Could it be an abdominal aortic aneurysm? I have no history of heart disease, nor do my parents. I always used to exercise, lately kick-boxing, but stopped for the summer and haven t resumed since. Never had an issue, maybe some occasional pains under the ribcage due to fatigue when the training was hard, that went away after some minutes. Could it be an aneurysm, or is it just my anxiety overwhelming me and making me overthink normal symptoms?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. No need to worry for aortic aneurysm. Your symptom is mostly due to anxiety related over thinking. In some persons, if they are thin, abdominal aorta pulsations can be seen through naked eye. This gives false belief of stomach pulsations. No need to worry for this because this is absolutely normal finding. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Don't worry for aneurysm. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

No, oxycodone can not cause heart palpitations. So this is not a cause for your symptoms. Sometimes, few patients do get cardiac arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) after surgery. And this can cause palpitations. So we should first rule out arrhythmia in your case. So get done ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hour continuous monitoring of ecg). If all these are normal then no need to worry for arrhythmia. Stress and anxiety related to surgery can also cause similar symptoms. So consult psychiatrist and discuss all these.

Yes, your blood pressure is too low. You are not imaging things, your all symptoms are due to hypotension. Atenolol is having dual effect. It controls pulse rate, it also causes reduction in blood pressure. So at present, better to stop Atenolol. Consult your doctor immediately for hypotension. Another possibility is hyponatremia (low sodium). Hyponatremia is common in patients with chronic diuretic use. You are taking triamtetene since 1 year.

First of all, you need to understand basis of bundle branch to understand IRBBB. There are two bundle branches in heart which transmit the impulse from atria to ventricle. Right and left. Any block in this transmission, can cause problem in transmission of impulse from atria to ventricle and hence ventricle will not function properly. In pediatric patient, most common cause for this is developmental defect. So in your son's case, his right bundle branch is blocked incompletely. So right ventricle is not functioning well. Right ventricle is connected to lungs, so he feels shortness of breath on exertion. Honestly speaking, this is serious health issue and this can worsen with the age. So consult cardiologist as soon as possible for this  IRBBB. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your son.

I can understand your concern. Your blood pressure and heart rate are normal, but since you are having history of atrial fibrillation and ablation, better to first rule out coronary artery disease as a cause for your left arm and Chest pain.

Musculoskeletal pain can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Take painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs. Apply warm water pad on affected areas.

I took her to ER yesterday she is having real bad headaches, her whole right side of her face in tingly she said, they did blood work and ct scan of her head, and a ct scan with contrast of her neck, urine sample, chest x-ray, EKG and they said that everything came back fine. She is real dizzy, and her blood pressure has been running around 155/99 which i know as a nurse that is to high. she does smoke and has smoked for about 40 years, but she dont smoke a pack a day. They diagnosed her with vertigo, but i dont beleive that is all that is wrong with her, could someone please help me?","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!I read carefully your question and understand your concern. As her brain CT scan has resulted normal, possible brain ischemia or hemorrhage have been excluded. High blood pressure could be the cause of persistent headache. I would recommend performing a brain MRI to detect possible brain ischemic events (which are not detected by the CT scan) and a Doppler ultrasound of the cervical vessels to examine the blood flow in her cervical arteries to investigate for possible vessel narrowing, which could lead to vertigo. Meanwhile, I would recommend to discuss with her attending physician to make the proper changes to her actual antihypertensive therapy in order to have a better control of high blood pressure. I would also recommend taking aspirin 80mg, to prevent possible brain ischemia (which could be related to the vertigo and tingling face). Hope to have been helpful!Best wishes, Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"I have been having problems with high blood pressure for a while now.  My doctor put me on a low dose diuretic which has lowered it a few points.  My issue is that the longer I sit the higher my blood pressure goes.  Once I get up and moving around or lay down it seems to bring my blood pressure back down.  I am a computer programmer and I sit all day writing code.  Could I somehow be effecting renin excretion by sitting?  Or something else?  I also have sinus tachycardia my resting heart rate averages at about 110.","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome to HCM!I carefully read your question and would explain that your symptoms could be related to orthostatic hypotension. You should know that blood pressure raises during standing up from sitting position. If there is a decrease in blood pressure more than 20mm Hg during standing up position compared to sitting position, orthostatic hypotension could be the cause. A head up tilt tests is needed to confirm/rule out this disorder. Hope to have been helpful!Kind regards, Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"over the last two weeks on three separate occasions i have felt as though my heart is being gently squeezed, a bit like a contraction, i can only describe the intensity as like a wave, starting very gently reaching a peak and then tapering off.  i am not in any pain but it is a very odd feeling","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having simple muscular spasm but better to rule out any heart diseases first. So get done ecg, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test). If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Simple muscle spasm is more likely in your case. So avoid bad postures in sleep. You can apply warm water pad on affected areas to avoid such contractions. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Am having a pulse ranging from 145 to190 and have been on cardizen and isoptin sr for 9 mnths with no change and of late i feel a strange chest pain and its hard to breathe. Am a female aged 31.whats the best way to slow down the heart rate and the chest pains?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. You are having arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) which is not responding to anti arrhythmia drugs. So you have to undergo ablation procedure. Arrhythmias if not treated can lead to heart complications and sudden death. You are having chest pain, so you need to control your fast heart as soon as possible. So better to consult cardiologist and get done Holter monitoring (24 hour continuous monitoring of ecg) and elctrophysiological study (EP study) for the diagnosis of arrhythmia. You will definitely improve with ablation procedure. These will reduce your heart rate an chest pain. So consult cardiologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I have had 3 episodes of nearly fainting in the last 6months,very light head,nausea,high pulse feels as if my heart is going to come through my chest,short of breath at times,blood pressure actually gets high(i work in a hospital where this has happened twice now)","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of TIA (transient ischemic attack) is more in your case. It is due to momentarily stopping of blood supply to brain. It is due to embolism. And high blood pressure and pulse rate are common causes for this. So you should definitely consult cardiologist and get done 1. Blood pressure monitoring 2. Ecg 3. 2d echo 4. CT scan of brain to rule out TIA. You will need cardiac supportive drugs and antihypertensive drugs. Don't worry, you will be alright. First consult cardiologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"what is my problem ????the symptoms are chest pain are intermittent along with a burning sensation,  abdominal bloating and frequent belching, while lifting something heavy or bending the pain worse, the chest pain located deep in the center of the chest ,most of the attacks occurred in the evening and also after a big meal also the blood pressure 140/75 with medication and difficulty swallowing, difficulty sleeping and coughing.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. Your symptoms are classical of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease).GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms of Central chest pain, burning, belching, bloating (gaseous distention) etc. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid stress and tension. 2. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Start proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drugs. 5. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. 6. Loose weight if you are obese. Don't worry, you will be alright. All these will also help in hypertension. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"i keep getting like pain in the left side of my chest that feels like something is squeezing my heart, it is not there all the time and when i get it there is not specific reason why it occurs. it also hurts more when i breath and sometimes makes my left shoulder hurt too.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern.Left sided squeezing type of pain with left shoulder pain are characteristic symptoms of cardiac chest pain. So better to consult cardiologist and get done blood pressure monitoring, ecg, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test) to rule out heart diseases. If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Musculoskeletal pain is also one possibility because you are having chest pain on breathing. So apply warm water pad on affected areas. Take painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs. Don't worry, you will be alright. But first rule out heart diseases. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"i recenly took my 7 month premuture son to doctor and doctor said that there is some problem in my son brain and we need to do ultrasound of brain, n report said: poor beam penetration due to very small/premutre closure of fontanels.lateral ventricles appear to be mildly dilated each measuring about 16mm. blood evaluation is not possible. so my question is what is the treatment and what are the risk and complications","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Your son is having premature closure of fontanales. These are gaps in skull which allow to grow brain upto the age of 5 years. So these children are prone for poor brain development and delayed milestones. Their motor functions are also reduced. Intelligent quotient (IQ) will also be low. Complications like brain edema, infection, hydrocephalus etc are more in these children. So your son needs to consult pediatric neurologist. He may need VP shunting (Ventricular peritoneal). Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your son. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I am a 40 year old female who has recently been diagnosed with PVC s. I had a 24 hour Holter monitor that showed 10,000 PVC s in that time period. The PVC s go away with exercise. I had become an avid long distance runner and lost 20 pounds in the past two years. I have run 2 half marathon races and was logging about 20 miles a week. I would push myself sprinting at the end going full force. My doctor has prescribed a Beta Blocker to see if the PVC s will lessen. He said I would be a good candidate for ablation if the Beta Blockers don t work. I am not running much now because I ve injured my knee, but I still run some and attend Boot Camp type classes at the gym. Did my running cause the PVC s? Is there anything natural I can take or a special diet I can follow to make them go away? Thank you so much for your advice!","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. PVCs (premature Ventricular contraction) are due to conduction defect in heart. It is due to accessory pathway in the heart. It is not caused by exercise (running) is not a cause for PVC. In patients PVCs can be due to stress and tension. So if you are having stressful life then avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. No natural remedies are available for PVCs. You need to take anti arrhythmia drug like beta blocker to suppress accessory pathway. If beta blocker fails then ablation of that pathway is the only option. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Since the end of September, my life has been utter hell to say the least. One night at work it came on all of a sudden. I felt a sudden wave of lightheadedness and could hear my heart beat pounding in my ears. I could feel my heart beating out of control, and that calmed down only a minute after sitting down but the lightheadedness continued....I have been living in dizzy hell for the past 7 months now!! Have seen a neurologist, ENT, and cardiologist. Everything came back normal except for a month after the dizzy spells started my heart rate shot up 220 at rest. I was diagnosed with SVT but doctors cannot find the source of the dizziness. The only thing that has been able to stop the fainting feeling has been anti-anxiety medication, such as Ativan which I was prescribed short term after ER doctors suspected I was having a panic attack(really, I had used caffeine and have since banned that from my diet). I m skeptical if this is purely psychiatric as of right now but am not completely ruling it out. I had a major car wreck 2 years ago and my ENT did notice I had some spinal cord inflammation by pressing on the left side of my neck and my neck gives me daily pain. email address: YYYY@YYYY Sorry for the ramble, I just really would like an answer or some advice. Thank you, Alexandra","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, your symptoms are mostly due to stress and anxiety. Drugs are important in control of anxiety. But along with drugs, counselling by psychotherapist is also very important in management of anxiety. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. Don't worry, you will be alright. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I have a son of 11 yrs. age.

Do I need medical help?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, you should definitely need medical help. You are at risk of heart disease because you are having hypertension, diabetes and obesity. You are also having positive family history of heart disease. You are having tachycardia on exertion which is not relieved by rest, so possibility of heart disease like coronary heart disease is more. So consult doctor and get done ecg, 2d echo and stress test to rule out heart diseases. Strict control of diabetes and hypertension are needed. Weight reduction is also beneficial.

I do not have insurance to go to ER","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. You are taking optimal drugs for hypertension but still not achieving normal blood pressure. So better to rule out diabetes and dyslipidemia because both these conditions can cause uncontrolled hypertension. So first get done sugar level and lipid profile to rule out diabetes and dyslipidemia. Strict salt restriction in diet and aerobic exercise like running, cycling etc are needed. Better not to take extra lisinopril without consulting your doctor. This may be harmful, so consult your doctor and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query.

I can understand your concern. Yes, you should definitely consult your doctor and get done ecg, 2d echo and stress test to rule out heart diseases. You are taking alcohol and have positive family history of heart disease, so we should first rule out heart diseases. If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Possibility of GERD is also there. Alcohol ingestion can cause laxity in lower esophageal sphincter. And this causes reflux and Chest tightness.

I can understand your concern. Yes, you should definitely control your systolic blood pressure below 140mmHg. For this strict salt restriction in diet is needed. You are taking your cardiac drugs since 8 years. So you may need high dose of some antihypertensive drug or you may need additional antihypertensive drug too. Make sure that you are taking newer beta blocker (metoprolol) because it is having excellent effect in post angioplasty patient. It reduces heart damage and also control blood pressure. So discuss all these with your heart doctor and start treatment accordingly. Avoid stress and tension, if you are having stressful life. Hope I have solved your query.

I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of heart block is more in your friend's case. It is conduction defect in heart when impulses are regularly conducted. So heart is not beating properly and hence blood circulation in the body is also not proper. Pace maker insertion is must for him. If he is not willing for pace maker, he may develop brain damage (paralysis) due to decreased blood supply to brain. Sudden stoppage of heart is also seen due to heart block.

The abnormal finding in your ECG could be related to myocardial ischemia (also called coronary artery syndrome).  Your low blood pressure doesn't seem to be related to the ECG changes. I would recommend consulting with a cardiologist and performing further tests to investigate for possible myocardial ischemia:- a cardiac ultrasound to examine your cardiac function and structure- a cardiac stress test or stress echo would examine the cardiac function during exertion and investigate for possible myocardial ischemia- an coronary angiogram. This would be the test of choice to examine the blood flow in the coronary arteries to investigate for possible vessel narrowing, which could lead to myocardial ischemia. This is an invasive test, and should be performed if high suspicions of coronary artery syndrome are raised. Hope you will find this answer helpful!Kind regards, Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"My blood pressure is 135 /95.  I'm a 62-year-old male, ex-smoker (quit 20 years ago) who is 6'1\\" and 205 pounds.

In my opinion, possibility of hormonal imbalance is more in your case but better to first rule out heart diseases. So get done ecg and 2d echo first. If both are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. You are in menopausal age and taking hormone. So possibility of hormonal imbalance is more. This can cause similar symptoms.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should first rule out heart diseases in your case because your symptoms are classical of angina pain. So get done ecg, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test). If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Sometimes stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms.

My stress level is a little high right now because of finals coming up.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, your palpitations are mostly due to high stress level in you. But at your age of 15 years, we should first rule out arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) as a cause for your palpitations. So get done ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hour continuous monitoring of ecg). If all these are normal then no need to worry for major heart diseases. Control of stress and anxiety are needed in your case. For this better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Don't worry, you will be alright.

I am still having this problem and following up with my doctor next week. The pain in my chest is a burning stabbing pain that goes down bothe arms, but more to the right than left.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Since your extensive cardiac work up is normal, possibility of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) related pain is more in your case. GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of burning, stabbing chest pain. So do following things for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid stress and tension. 2. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Start proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drugs. 5. Go for walking after meals. 6. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

I can understand your concern. These symptoms are common after motor vehicular accident (MVA) and known as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The basic etiology behind this is sympathetic over activity. This causes adrenaline and nor adrenaline release. These two hormones act on all organs of the body. They cause hypertension when they act on blood vessels. They cause increased heart rate (tachycardia) when they act on heart. Skin glands causes goose bumps under their influence.

You should continue anti hypertensive drugs without interruption through out the life. Hypertension is life long disease. And for control of this you need to take regular drugs.

Im a little concerned as im 40 yrs old and have had 2 previous heart attach and 2 stents.. do you think it is just musclaur pain .there is one spot that to touch feel like a knife going in","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more. But since you are having previous heart attacks and stents, better to first rule out heart diseases. So first get done ecg and 2d echo. If both these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Then musculoskeletal pain is more likely. So apply warm water pad on affected areas. Take painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs. Don't worry, you will be alright. But first rule out heart diseases. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

But other things have to be ruled out like arrhythmia, chf, low or high BP. If he hit a hard object he should get ct scan brain to r/o SDH because he had a bump. he should be checked by ur Cardiologist."},{"Patient":"I feel great, I feel strong .

Since your symptoms are only when you are not doing anything, possibility of stress related symptoms is more. But better to rule out heart diseases like arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) first. Because arrhythmia can cause similar quivering feeling in heart. So get done ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hour continuous monitoring of ecg). If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Divert your mind from this feeling. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

It Shows my Heart chambers and valves are normal. Ihave no symptoms of any please tell my condition","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Since your 2d echo report is normal, no need to worry for mild cardiomegaly on chest x ray. In my opinion, you should get done blood pressure monitoring because undiagnosed hypertension can also cause mild cardiomegaly on chest x ray. If your blood pressure is also normal then no need to worry for this x ray finding because mild cardiomegaly can be just a subjective finding of radiologist. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"My wife has been experiencing shortness of breath, tightness of the chest, and elevated heart rate.  Our GP ran a ekg and told her she had an inverted t wave, she is scheduled for a CAT scan, but we are nervous and don't know what to expect. What can you do for an inverted t wave?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Inverted T wave on ecg (electro cardio gram) is due to myocardial ischemia. It is due to reduced blood supply to heart and most common cause for this is coronary artery obstruction. Her symptoms like shortness of breath, tightness in chest and tachycardia (high pulse rate) are also favoring coronary artery blockade. So she needs to consult cardiologist and get done CT coronary angiography. This will diagnose coronary artery blockade if present. If she is having blockage then urgent stenting should be done. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your wife. Thanks."},{"Patient":"ecg report vent rate63 bpmPR interval 152 msQRS duration 148 msQT/QTC454/464 msP-R-T axes 26/26/244RR/PP956/PP interval 956/950 msSystem Evaluationnormal sinus rhythm left bundle blockHDL Colestral 35swear pain during fast walking & Eye sight intruption/looses for fifteen mts once","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Your ecg (electro cardio gram) is suggestive of left bundle branch block. There are two conduction systems in heart by which pulse is generated and heart beats. One is right bundle branch and other is left bundle branch. Left one supplies left side of heart which is main part of heart which supplies blood to whole body. So any conduction defect in this part will cause reduced blood supply to body organs like brain, eyes, lungs, liver, kidneys etc. So your symptom of sight inturption is due to reduced blood supply to eyes. So you should immediately consult cardiologist and start treatment. You may need pacemaker insertion. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

In my opinion, we should rule out heart diseases first because heart diseases can cause similar feeling of hollowness especially at night. So get done ecg, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test). If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Sometimes GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) can also cause similar symptoms. So take proton pump inhibitors before bed time.

I can understand your concern. No, you can not live longer with blocked celiac artery. You need to treat it first. If not going to treat you will develop bowel ischemia, obstruction, infection etc. And all these are life threatening complications. So you need to treat yourself as soon as possible. Removal of blocked segment of celiac artery and anastomosis with venous graft is treatment of choice for this. For this part of your calf vein is used.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having hormonal imbalance and related symptoms. You already have implant and also took hormone pill. So this may cause hormonal imbalance in you. Hormones like FSH, LH, Estrogen, Progesterone etc if imbalanced can cause similar symptoms like palpitations, shaky feeling, heart burn etc. So first consult gynecologist and get done hormone levels.

It could lead to pain in the back and shoulders, and high blood pressure due to the physical stress. - an aortic dissection could lead to this clinical scenario- anxiety could also cause similar symptoms. I recommend going to the ER for a careful physical exam and some tests: - a resting ECG and cardiac ultrasound- a chest X ray study - a cervic-thoracic column X ray study- some blood lab tests ( CPK for possible myalgia, a complete blood count, inflammation tests).

GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of burning sensation in lower chest. So we should first treat GERD in your case. For this, avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals.

Anxiety could also mimic this clinical situation. I recommend consulting with your doctor for a careful physical examination and some tests: - a resting ECG and a cardiac ultrasound to examine your heart structure and function- an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring to examine your heart rhythm trends during the day- lab blood tests (complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, blood electrolytes). I recommend discussing with your doctor on the above issues.

Anyway my Mom just witnessed him get dizzy and almost fall down. He says this happens sometimes but she has never seen it happen. His Bp was 116/62 when he sat back down and my mom made him check it. Isn't that low for him?","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!I passed carefully through your history and would explain that his blood pressure values are not too low to cause fainting or dizziness. Orthostatic hypotension could be the cause of his symptomatology. I recommend measuring his blood pressure during sitting and standing up position. If there is a decrease in his blood pressure more than 20mmHg during standing up position, compared to sitting position, this could indicate orthostatic hypotension. A Head up Tilt test is needed to rule in/out this disorder. I would also recommend performing some other tests to exclude other possible causes related to his heart: - a resting ECG and cardiac ultrasound- some blood lab tests (complete blood count, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes, fasting glucose and HbA1C). If orthostatic hypotension is confirmed some modifications to his actual therapy may be needed.

I was walking 15 mins and then started doing the aerobic workout it walks up gradually and then down. My walking rate is slow...2.0. A few days ago and then today while walking my heart rate was 190, 205. Should i be concerned/","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, you should definitely consult cardiologist for this. Heart rate of around 200 on walking is very high. This suggests that your heart has to work very fast to meet the body needs in exertion. Common cause for this is reduced blood supply to heart due to coronary artery blockade. Atherosclerosis is the likely cause for such blockage. So better to get done trade mill test (TMT) for the diagnosis of exercise induced ischemia and if it is positive then you will need coronary angiography for the diagnosis of coronary artery blockade. Don't worry, with proper treatment, you will be alright. Consult cardiologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

What are your suggestions? Thank you for hearing me out","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should first get done repeat EP (electro physiological) study to determine the accessory pathways. If this is same as previously then no need for ablation and pacemaker. Cordarone is good drug to control arrhythmia. And don't worry much about side effects. These side effects can be easily managed. If your EP study is worse then the previous study, you need AV node ablation and pacemaker. So first get done fresh EP study and then decide future plan of treatment. Hope I have solved your query.

Stress and tension are biggest risk factors for hypertension. Since you are having stressful life, you should definitely get done repeat blood pressure monitoring after 1 week and if you still have higher pressure readings then you need to start anti hypertensive drug. Stress management is the key in your case. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Counselling plays very important role in control of stress along with drug. This will also help in control of blood pressure. No need to worry, you will be alright.

No, don't take nitro tablet without consulting your doctor because this can be life threatening as nitro tablet can cause hypotension. In my opinion, you should consult your cardiologist and get done fresh ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hour continuous monitoring of ecg). These will tell you if your pacemaker is not working properly. It will also tell you if any arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) is present or not.

In my opinion, he is mostly having stress and anxiety related GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). But better to get done ecg to rule out heart diseases. If ecg is normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Stress, anxiety and depression cause laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of gastritis, chest pain, chest tightness, burping etc. So control of anxiety and depression are must in his case and hence better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions.

Thank you","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. You are having high cholesterol and high LDL levels. And for this daily lipid lower drug is needed, not alternate day.  You are also taking lower dose. So in my opinion, you should take 20 mg of rosuvastatin daily for 1 month. Get done repeat lipid profile after 1 month. If your lipids are within normal range then taper down dose to 10 mg daily. No role of taking rosuvastatin every other day.

Thanks","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. TMT (trade mill test) positive is suggestive of decreased blood supply to heart in exertion. And most common cause for this is coronary artery obstruction. At your age of 65 years coronary artery blockade is common due to atherosclerosis. So you should definitely get done Coronary angiography to diagnose blockage. If blockage is there then you will need stenting to open blocked coronary artery. By doing this, we can restore blood supply to heart. So angiography is not only diagnostic but it is also therapeutic. You should also start anti platelet and anticoagulant drugs like clopidogrel and aspirin. If you don't start treatment, you may end up in heart failure and sudden cardiac death..

Yes, hole in heart can cause cough and breathing difficulty. Hole in heart is mostly due to Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD). In this type of defect, there is mixing of blood from two (left and right) ventricles. Due to this there is back pressure in lungs which is causing Pulmonary hypertension and Pulmonary edema. So better to get done fresh 2 d echo and CT Pulmonary angiography to rule out these complications. If defect is large then surgical repair is the only option.

I can understand your concern. Heart is having two layers around it, perital and visceral pericardium. Normally these two layers are not seen on 2d echo but when there is excess fluid accumulation between these layers then it is known as pericardial effusion. Most common cause for pericardial effusion is heart failure. You are also having diastolic dysfunction. This is also indicating easy heart failure. Diastolic dysfunction means your heart is not relaxing properly, so fluid accumulation around heart is seen. So you need diuretic and other supportive drugs to overcome fluid accumulation.

You should know that waking up imposes a high level of stress to the body. Nevertheless, I would recommend checking thyroid hormone levels for possible thyroid gland dysfunction. Coming to this point, I would recommend low dose of betablocker to help reduce heart rate and blood pressure values. In this regard, low dose of Carvedilol would be a rational choice.

It's a complex condition which needed detailed evaluation and discussion on treatment.  However as he has started having symptoms.  The best medication to start is beta blocker metoprolol 50 mg and built to maximum dose ( about 200 mg)  keeping a tab on blood pressure and pulse rate . He should not be asthmatic to take take it safely . A blood thinner like small dose aspirin 75 mg would also help till you see your doctor .

These hormone will result in constriction of the blood vessels and making your heart pump more vigorously pushing your blood pressure UP. By all means you will have to sort out the reasons why you have suddenly started hating your work . Remember stress will only harm your health and nothing else.

In January my ejection fracture went back to normal 60% with metoprolol.. Starting in Feb started to feel dizzy and weak, having near syncope episodes. I've been in all kind of holter monitors and none of them really picked up anything besides my heart rate being really high or really low. ( also my blood pressure likes to hang out around the 80's) On the 26th of April,2012 i got an implanted Loop Monitor.  I had a near syncope episode on the 28th and just took note of it. Yesterday May 3,2012 I went for a regular scheduled appointed to download the DATA off the monitor and the Tech saw that my heart had stopped twice, one being 11 seconds and the other one 18 seconds long. This happened around the time that I had the near syncope episode.  My cardiologist scheduled me for a pacemaker implant that same day.  However, right before I got to the hospital my cardiologist called me and told me that he would like to wait on the pacemaker.  I dont know why he would want to wait when they have record that my heart had stopped for 18 seconds. It is still puzzling me and it is really frustrating. I am 24 years old, Do you Doc's have any idea of what might have changed his mind?","Doctor":"Hello ,Now considering that there was a pause for so long , without doubt It's an indication of pacemaker . Now because As you said that the function have returned to normal , Generally there should not be such episodes . One thing that explains is ongoing inflammation of the heart muscle , but its temporary and may settle down by itself . Lastly I would just like to point out , trust me at 24 years of age if we can avoid a pacemaker it's best , because it stays with you for life and requires care . However if still in future there is evidence of such pauses , it would be safer to put a defibrillator. Let me know if any clarification needed .

The reasons may be 1) normally as we age the pulse decrease because metabolism of our body slows down .2) As you are active , the heart is well trained and hence the pulse would go low as such heart can effectively pump more blood with each heart beat 3) many medication for hypertension particularly beta blocker can decrease the pulse rate .

I can understand your concern. Air around heart is known as pneumomediastinum. And this can cause similar symptoms like she is having. This is serious condition. Patient needs CT thorax for confirmation of this. Treatment lies in 1. Continuous oxygen inhalation. 2. Oral bronchodilator. 3. Inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid. 4.

So better to get done ecg and 2d echo to rule out heart diseases. Get done chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to rule out lung related diseases. If all these are normal then no need to worry much. Quit smoking if you are smoker. Vitamin b 12 deficiency and anaemia can also cause numbness in chest. So get done vitamin b 12 level and hemoglobin estimation. If deficiency then you need supplements. Don't worry, you will be alright. Consult doctor and discuss all these.

I can understand your concern. Yes, you should definitely consult cardiologist and rule out out arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart). You are having tachycardia, sweating, shortness of breath. All these favour arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation(AF), atrial flutter, supra ventricular tachycardia (SVT) more. And all these are common in young female especially after delivery. So better to consult cardiologist and get done ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hour continuous monitoring of ecg). On the basis of reports, you will need anti arrhythmia drugs.

This means that your heart is not getting enough blood when you are exerting. Most common cause for this is coronary artery obstruction. So you should definitely consult cardiologist and get done Coronary angiography to rule out coronary artery blockade. If blockage is there then you will need angioplasty with stenting to open the blocked artery and restoration of blood supply. So next step in your case is cardiologist consultation and angiography to rule out coronary artery blockade. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

But in the past few weeks things have gotten worse with the palpitations and last night I started having a tingling sensation in my left arm with a little pain. What could this be? Could I be experiencing some type of heart failure?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. At your age of 26 years, heart failure is unlikely. But we should first rule out arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) in your case because it can cause palpitations and left arm tingling sensations in young patients. So consult cardiologist and get done ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hour continuous monitoring of ecg). If all these are normal then no need to worry for arrhythmia. Sometimes stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid stress and tension. Be relax and calm. Consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions.

Your blood sugar level is normal. But your blood pressure and pulse rate are not normal. You are having hypotension and high pulse rate (tachycardia). Tachycardia is mostly due to hypotension. Most common cause for hypotension is decreased oral intake of fluids. Other causes are infection, dehydration, heart diseases etc. So better to get done blood report like complete blood count and ecg. If both are normal then you are mostly having dehydration and fluid deficit. So drink plenty of fluids orally and keep yourself hydrated. Drink 2-2.5 liters fluid per day. Once blood pressure is normal, pulse rate will also come down to normal. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Anyway considering your blood pressure values, which are abnormal for your age, I would recommend performing further tests to investigate for the possible causes: - kidney and liver function tests - blood electrolytes - thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction - cortisol and aldosterone plasma levels for possible adrenal gland dysfunction. A Doppler ultrasound of the carotid arteries would help exclude possible narrowing. If these blood pressure values persist. I would recommend starting anti-hypertensive therapy.

I can understand your concern. Yes, you are right about rise in blood pressure after steroid injection. But it is not true for all patients. The woman in question might be having heart failure. Heart failure can cause breathlessness, low systolic pressure (hypotension) and edema feet. In this, steroids won't help. Diuretic and other cardiac supportive drugs are needed. In heart failure, systolic pressure decreases fast then diastolic pressure. This is due to poor force of contraction by failing heart. So difference between systolic and diastolic pressures come down to less than 20. And when this occurs, patient needs urgent treatment in the form of inotropic drugs.

PFT will tell you about severity of the disease and treatment of asthma is based on severity only. You may need regular inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Oral combination of antihistamine and anti allergic drugs is also beneficial in your case. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

All the other reports which you have mentioned are perfectly withen normal limits and you shouldn't worry about the same , even uric acid at 7 , no treatment is indicated at present . Now about TMT,  the symptoms you describe are not characteristic for angina , however because of the risk factors which I have mentioned and if you are obese , smoke or have angina stressful life you fall into intermediate risk for coronary event in future , so for you TMT is a good test to rule out underlying cardiac issues.  In TMT they make you run on a treadmill and monitor your blood pressure vitals and see ecg changes . Also any symptoms during exercise is unmasked . So in short they make your heart exercise and check whether everything is ok than . Hence if your TMT is fine you may rule out any critical blocks indirectly.  So yes TMT would be a good test to rule out heart as the cause of the chest discomfort you feel . Hoping I could help .

So 53 per day is not an indication for decreasing  beta blocker .

My question is  why I am taking four types of pills from all from group of treating HBP.? and what could be the best prescription for treating hbp.","Doctor":"Hello , The best combination for you would be combination of ace inhibitor and calcium channel blocker and optimise the dose of each to max .

Still if it's not controlled multiple medications from different group may be tried to bring blood pressure under 135/85 at all times . A alfa blocker like prazocin would be good alternative In spite of such healthy lifestyle you may still need to take medication if the pressure are controlled,  because you may be prone to higher blood pressure genetically.

Recommended therapy was weight reduction to his ideal level, a low-salt diet ( 2 gm/day sodium), prudent exercise, and a reduction in alcohol consumption ( 3 oz whiskey/day).

I went through the history in detail and I would like to say that the protocol followed be your doctors is in consensus with the standard one followed throughout the world .

Here I would like to point out that even with optimum diet and aerobic exercise tge maximum decrease in blood pressure achieved in all the studies have been a decrease was upto 7 mm He in systolic and 4 mm hg in diastolic pressure . So when your blood pressure in the initial part was so high by joining means it was going to normalise without medication.

Last  night he complained that his right side of his face was numb, he said he drooled a bit in the morning.  I thought it could be a mild stroke but he wasn't complaining about his arm or legs.  He went to the doctor and now they are doing more tests today.He's a smoker, 76 yo and very active for his age.  He has been diagnosed with prostate cancer about a year ago but reasonably stable.We want to take him to Europe as he loves to travel and thought this would be the best time now.  We were planning this in 3 weeks time to leave for 2 1/2 weeks.  We are worried that travel will create more problems or spike his blood pressure.","Doctor":"Hello I am Dr. Mody and I would be addressing your concern . I would enumerate my suggestions as . 1) The symptoms you describe still fits into a stroke as most common cause,  it's not necessary that the hands and legs may be involved in all stroke , the other possibility would be bells palsy . 2) The blood pressure should be maintained below 140 / 90 with the help of lifestyle and medications all the time . 3) If the blood pressure are ok ,  it would be ok to travel as you are very right in thought , as a son about taking your father on a tour and rather that will improve his overall well being .

I went through the details you gave . Of all medications Verapamil is the only medication specifically for Svt.  Olmezest is for hypertension.  Atorvastatin for cholesterol . Off all the medication.  Aprazolam is a sedative and anti anxiety drug . This is one medication you should try to wean off . At least the morning dose . However as you are taking for 5 years it has to tapered very slowly.  Your risk factor is obesity and till you lose weight it remains . So continuation of medication is a safer alternative.  One can undergo ablation for Svt to take care of it forever , however if it's controlled on medication always better option than an invasive procedure.

In denial for some months after until I could noticeably feel my heart beating in an irregular manner. When I went to my GP I was referred to 2 specialists- 1 cardio & 1 endocrine. Within 2 months I had undergone heart related stress tests, echo and monitoring while taking the Rx Pradaxa to reduce any possible unknown risks. At the end of the 2 months I had radiation treatment for the thyroid. It took about 7 weeks to regulate my thyroid with synthrax. I requested an alternative to pradaxa after seeing a bad drug commercial and was placed on warfin, 1-2x a day dependent on how I feel. Not having specific dosage plan landed me in the ER where I was admitted and given blood transfusion within 2 hours of arrival! I continued to visit ER on 3 separate occasions that week. Had an overnight stay on 1st visit where I was monitored, provided all needed remedies and blood was tested for the Immediate end of warfin use, of course. After 1 week I saw cardio and he prescribed Xarelto for my AFib. Although I was afraid I complied with the doctors request, the very same Dr that prescribed warfin. I have taken xarelto now for over 2 years and at a cardio checkup nearly 6 months ago he tells me that my AFib is no longer heard and wants to do the same tests performed 3 years ago to confirm before taking me off the medication. The tests are completed, confirming his diagnosis that my AFib is no longer present- yet I am still on the medication and have visited him more frequently than with the condition. Is there a medical reason for this? I am now experiencing upper left arm numbness for a noticeable period of untimed minutes 2 or 3 times a week. What could be the culprit- warfin long term effects, xarelto taken for non existing condition, possible stroke or any other non related med issue ie back or activities? I do not want another adverse reaction caused by this secondary and now non apparent issue. What can or should I do? Also take 1 lisprinol for hypertension and 2 500mg Tylenol 2-3x a day for arthritis.","Doctor":"Hello , I am Dr. Mody we'd I would be addressing your concern . I went through your history in detail . Now there is a high probability that the atrial fibrillation you had was because of hyperthyroidism.  Now considering that is has been completely taken care of there is to a fair chance that the atrial fibrillation may never occur again . Considering your age as 60 yeqrs at that point of time , there is a possibility that atrial fibrillation may be because of age related degeneration of the heart , whereby the atrial fibrillation may come again . Warfarin , xarelto are medications to prevent formation of clot in the heart thereby preventing the risk of stroke . So taking either of them has been shown medically to be helpful without doubt  . So my recommendation would be . 1) if there is enough evidence on echocardiography and holter that the chances of atrial fibrillation occurring in future is rare , you may consider stopping warfarin or xarelto.2) considering your age an underlying blockages in heart arteries should be always kept in mind . A treadmill stress test would be good rest to rule out the same 3) neither warfarin after so long or xarelto can directly cause the numbness you describe.  4) Yes it can be a mini stroke ( what we call transient is chemical attack ) of the Brian 5) or in high probability it due to some compression of nerves due to age related denervation of cervical spine , a simple X ray will rule that out , or muscular sprain   Let me know if further clarification is needed .

It’s possible for anxiety and stress to cause physical symptoms, like heart palpitations, problem sleeping, cold or sweaty hands and/or feet, feelings of panic, fear, and uneasiness, numbness or tingling in the hands or feet and depression.I will advise you to make necessary changes in your life style like:-Start Exercising-Exercise releases endorphins and tires muscles, both of which drastically reduce your anxiety experience. Exercising, especially jogging is extremely important for managing anxiety.Avoid Stress-Avoiding stress is often easy to say and difficult to do.

Thank you","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!Your symptoms are compatible with a disorder called \\"palmar erythema\\" in. This condition can be caused by various medical problems, each having its own range of severity. In a lot of patients, red palms have no identifiable cause and they are presented under primary palmar erythema. However, there are many cases in which the red palms are a symptom of another disease, being presented as secondary palmar erythema. I would mention:-smoking and alcohol intake-high blood pressure-thyroid dysfunction-kidney or liver disorders-polycythemia vera-diabetes-rheumatological disorders, etc.. I would recommend performing inflammation tests and thyroid hormone levels to exclude this possibility. Your renal function, may be related to it.

It is important making a careful differential diagnosis of your symptoms: - a backbone disorder, leading to irradiating pain in the arms, related to a slipped disc could mimic this symptomatology. -an ischemic heart disease, could explain the pain while exercising, but not the irradiating pain in both arms. -gastro esophageal reflux, could be related to heartburn during physical activity. I recommend consulting with your attending physician for a careful physical examination and some tests: -resting ECG -chest X ray study-cervico-thoracic column X ray study-lab blood tests (complete blood count, PCR, sedimentation rate, amylaze plasma levels, kidney and liver function tests). A cardiac stress test may be needed to exclude a cardiac ischemic disease if suspicions are raised. A fibrogastroscopy may be needed if all the above tests result normal, to exclude possible reflux.

Long story short is that through a series of different doctor consultations I now have had one visit with a cardiologist to review a nuclear stress test recently performed. After explaining my situation the doctor told me that the sensation on my lower right side was due to an abnormal imagining on the right side of my heart.

Iâ??ve had an EKG, ultrasound for gall bladder, x-rays and blood tests. None have indicated any problem. The stress test according to the cardiologist is an indication of my symptoms.

I have increased my exercise significantly, improved my diet, lost over 10 lbs in the last couple weeks and continue with medication. Thanks for your advice.","Doctor":"Hi, Cardiac pain can radiate to a variety of places including the right lower chest. If the results of the nuclear stress test (which is considered a very good test) are abnormal, you should definitely go for at least an angiography. It is just a test to confirm the results of the stress test. No stent is put in angiography. Angiography will tell you exactly if you really have cardiac disease and what treatment will you need.

I am taking Labetalol, Ramipril, Hydrochlorothiazide, Amlopidene and Chlopodigrel. For the past year and a half I have been having the following symptoms - chest tightness, dizzyness, and nausea. These symptoms occur when I go from a condition of rest and begin to walk. They last 10-15 seconds and then disappear. Once they end I can walk for several miles seldom with a reoccurrence. I ve noticed them when I am on a treadmill and they usually begin almost immediately. While I am having them my heart rate increases rapidly, usually from low 70 s to around 95-100 in that 10-15 second period. My heart rate then begins to decline and at the same time the symptoms disappear. Usually I can continue a 2 mile walk without a reoccurance. The strange thing is I never have these symptoms when my stomach is empty but almost always will have them after eating. I have had 3 stress tests (all negative) and my doctor has me lined up for a heart catheterization next week. Since they only occur on a full or somewhat full stomach could they be caused by something like an ulcer or other stomach related cause? The feeling is very uncomfortable.","Doctor":"Hello , considering that age , hypertension are risk factors of a heart related issue and the Symptoms you describe can many a times referred as anginal pain , it's always wise to rule out underlying cardiac pathology.  Also treadmill stress test (TMT) is not the best test when the suspicion of heart issue is high . The sensitivity of TMT is around 75% meaning we may miss 1 in every 4 patients.  However once the cardiac pathology is ruled out either by cardiac perfusion scan or catheterisation , as you truly mentioned a underlying stomach pathology should be suspected particularly some reflux gastritis , the symptom favouring the same is that your pain subsides after the initial walk and later you are able to walk for long time without any significant pain. A trial of it antacid like imperative 40 mg may be taken for 3 weeks before breakfast.  However as I would again say it's prudent to rule out underlying cardiac if any before considering alternative.

It is important performing a complete check up to find out the possible cause of your symptomatology. As your clinical situation has been like this for a week and you are still with the same symptoms, I think that you should wait for an appointment with your doctor until the next week. But if your clinical situation worsens (especially with chest pain or shortness of breath) you should go to the ER to perform a resting ECG and cardiac enzymes to exclude possible acute coronary syndrome. It is important performing also other tests by your GP to find out the possible cause of this clinical scenario: - chest X ray study- a cardiac ultrasound-blood lab tests (complete blood count, PCR, sedimentation rate, thyroid hormone levels, fasting glucose, kidney and liver function tests). You should closely monitor your blood pressure several times during the day and refer those values to your attending physician. An antihypertensive therapy should be started if your blood pressure stays most of the time at these levels. Meanwhile, I would recommend avoiding salt and caffeine intake with food and straining physical activity.

That is why it is important to examine your cardiac function.- the dreams could be related to a sleep disorder or to epileptic seizures. Do you dream with eyes opened during the day or just at night? Brain hypoxia related to cardiac arrhythmia could be the cause. I recommend consulting with your attending physician for a careful physical examination and some tests: -chest X ray study and respiratory function tests-resting ECG and cardiac ultrasound. An ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring would help examine your heart rhythm trends during the day. - blood lab tests (complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, blood electolytes, kidney and liver function tests, blood fasting glucose, etc.)- an EEG to examine your brain function.

I am 44 years old and a female. Should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that your symptoms could be related to a cardiac arrhythmia. I recommend consulting with your attending physician for a careful physical examination and some tests: -resting ECG and cardiac ultrasound to examine your cardiac function-chest X ray study-blood lab tests (complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, fasting glucose, PCR, sedimentation rate, blood electrolytes). An ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring would be needed to examine your heart rhythm trends during the day.

I still don t feel right as my initial symptom before meds was feeling pressure in my head and like i was dizzy or going to pass out. What else could be at play? Should I try other meds? I am worried that my diastolic and pulse are still high.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for your question on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that your symptoms don't seem to be related to your blood pressure. Your actual blood pressure values seem to be OK. Your diastolic blood pressure is within the normal ranges too. Regarding your heart rate, it doesn't seem to be elevated, becuase it is normal to have similar fluctuations during the day. Nevertheless, I would recommend performing a Doppler ultrasound of the cervical arteries to examine the blood flow to the brain and exclude any possible vessel stenosis, which could lead to the episodes of dizziness. Thyroid hormone levels, are necessary to exclude possible thyroid dysfunction. Regarding your headache, I would recommend consulting with a neurologist for a careful physical examination and a possible brain CT scan to find out the cause. A routine blood tests for chronic anemia or inflammation would be necessary too.

Nevertheless betablockers are known to reduce the muscular performance and cause fatigue and dizziness, and these symptoms may also be considered adverse effects of concor. Your blood pressure values are still high and an antihypertensive therapy is needed. I would recommend stopping taking concor and start on an ARB drug ( valsartan, temisartan, etc.) or an ACE I (ramipril, enalapril, etc.). A diuretic (hydroclorthiazid) or a calcium channel blocker may be added to the therapy if needed. The goal of the anti hypertensive therapy would be blood pressure values below 130/85mm Hg. Meanwhile, I would advise some lifestyle modifications like: - modify your diet (reduce salt and caffeine intake)- perform a lot of physical activity (walking, aerobics, etc.)- loose weight if you are overweight. You should discuss with your attending physician on the above issues.

How many hours after eating did you perform the blood test? I would recommend performing a fasting glucose and a glucose tolerance test, including HbA1C to exclude the possibility of diabetes. From the other hand your blood pressure seems to be OK, but your heart rate is a little high. Do you have any symptoms like palpitations, chest discomfort, shortness of breathing? Regarding the blueish feet and the headache, these symptoms could be related to an inflammatory disease, to a viral infection. Do you have any fever? A peripheral arteriopathy can not be excluded as the possible cause of the changes in the color of your feet. I recommend consulting with your attending physician for a careful physical examination and some tests: -resting ECG-chest X ray study- Doppler ultrasound of the leg vessels-blood lab tests: complete blood count, PCR, sedimentation rate, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes.

Also, You have high blood pressure. Muscle fatigue is a very vague symptom. There are various causes from simple vitamin deficiency to complicated as muscle disorder as myopathy or neuropathy. Not to get worried, simple things to do is the consultation with your family physician. Discuss your test with him and decide which test you need to get it done. I recommend the Thyroid function test, Vitamin D levels, ECG and A  2D echogram initially. If your blood pressure remains high then you need to start medication and restrict your salt intake to 2 gm per day. I am worried about your shortness of breath if it is frequent and troublesome then it should be addressed urgently.

Anyway 10 months later, as today, I still have high BP. 145/90. My family doctor advised me to lose some weight and get on a more healthy diet (less salt and sugar) and avoid any medicine right now. Instead he prescribed me deanxit, being very stressed, feeling low and sad for a very long time now. Is this a good idea? Will this medicine help me get my BP lower also? I'm also subject to tachycardia and I forgot to ask my doctor if deanxit will affect my heart beats. I'm also about to start a treatment with isosupra for acne , is it compatible with deanxit? I know that isosupra affects the mood.Thank you for reading and answering me.Regards","Doctor":"Hello , you had pre eclampsia during pregnancy.  It was wise decision to have a CS as soon as the water broke . Btw about 10 -20 percentage of patients who had hypertension during pregnancy may have persistent hypertension throughout and these are the patients who require long term medication for blood pressure.  However as your pressure are just borderline we may wait and give diet and lifestyle changes ro take care of the slightly higher pressure.  Also yes anxiety does push the blood pressure high and so treatment for the same may decrease the pressure is that's the predominant cause . What you are feeling is called post part um blues and it's very common after a complicated pregnancy.  Peer support would be ideal here . Isospura can be taken with Deanxit. however plz note that Isospura should NOT be taken if you are breastfeeding.

I had open heart surgery for removal of a left atrial myxoma on 11/25/13.

He said it is such a small dose that I don't have to wean off of it. 30 years ago I was put on Inderal for migraines(don't remember dose) and I had Sob and developed allergic bronchitis from the Inderal.

However there are fair chances that if you did not tolerate inderal you might not tolerate lopressor too . The dose of inderal you are on is very mild , however I would prefer that you take once a day 12.5 mg for a week and than stop to make sure that pac 's don't occur . Yes both inderal and lopressor can cause allergic bronchitis  ( asthma ) like picture and it should be avoided if that is the case.

I had a normal EKG a year ago, but also had treatment for breast cancer that included doxarubacin and cytoxin, then taxol, followed by radiation.  The cancer was bilateral, and I had lumpectomies.  Could the a-fib be a result of the cancer treatment?","Doctor":"Yes Treatment for cancer can cause atrial fibrillation . Ratiation and medication for cancer chemotherapy like Duxoroubicin,  Taxal and to less extent other medications are cardio toxic , such that they affect the Heart muscle causing inflammation.  When this inflammation subsides there is some residual fibrosis in between the heart muscle . This fibrosis acts as substrate for rhythm disturbances , common among them is a trial fibrillation.  A 2 d echocardiography more precise  Cardiac Mri is suggested to know extent of any damage to the heart . In many causes though there is no decrease in pumping of the heart  ( mechanical ) , still arrythmia may happen sue to electrical disturbances.  Let me know if any clarification needed.

My advice for you would be to relax , calm down and let the medical practitioner handle this. Any way even if the blood pressure ranges to be in the higher side(once again I'm telling you not to go into readings as the readings'll only mislead you since High/Low BP is a variable factor which differs from each and every individual), it's always better to get checked by a physician and act accordingly.Once again thank you for using HCM, happy to help"},{"Patient":"my husband is suffering with heart failure.

Also average BP of 141/93MMHG can be just normal for some individuals. These are just clinical findings which needs to be thoroughly evaluated thoroughly before coming down to some conclusion. First of all just get a 12Lead ECG done (preferably with long lead II), also please attach it here so that I can comment further Please don't panic and try to understand that Tachycardia can be there even in a otherwise healthy individual, doesn't necessarily mean that you're having a heart condition.But my advice in this case would be to get a proper metabolic work-up done(CBC, Serum Electrolytes , Thyroid Function Test, ESR along with 12Lead ECG off course ) before coming down to any conclusionThanks a lot for contacting HCM , let me update further in your next follow-up"},{"Patient":"Good to hear that i have got atleast some body to answer my query. my uncle has got HIV.

The first day it had only occurred three times, hours apart from each time. Yesterday at work, it happened every hour, almost on the hour. What are some symptoms that lead to this?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I read your query. Providing your age would help in addressing your problem. However, I will try to address your concern. Pain caused from a blockage/narrowing within a coronary artery, is most common after the age of 45 years old for male population and over 55 years old for the female population. It is called angina, and presents more like tenderness, heaviness or squeezing feeling in the middle of the chest, rather than clear-cut pain. It arises in physical efforts, radiates to both sides of the chest, jaw, left shoulder and left pain. It signifies an important blockage within a certain coronary artery, which is \\"translated\\" in angina after the demand of supplying the heart muscle is increased (e.g. physical effort). If this is the case, then a full cardiac check-up is recommended. First, an EKG and an echocardiogram, then, judged by the results, a cardiac stress test may be suggested to you. If the latter comes back positive, a coronary angiogram would be in order, to assess the blockages within coronary arteries. I hope I have been of help. Wish you a good health. Take care, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"Hi after my hearth attack I had angioplasty on the 22nd of January, today march 5th the same leg is numb from the spot that was cut all the way down to my foot is it normal? Should I worry? I previously had some discomfort on the abdomen close to the incision and the cardiologist said the pulse sounded good.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I carefully read your query. Puncture site-related complications of the coronary angiogram/coronary angioplasty do not take one and a half months to be produced and become worrisome. Actually, they are seen immediately to six hours after the procedure. A pain or numbness or coldness on a certain limb indeed indicates problems with the blood flow to that limb, but I do not think that there is a connection between the femoral artery puncture and the leg numbness of your leg, in this case, at least. As an invasive cardiologist, I, too, check the pulses periodically, after the procedure, and good and filled pulses indicate that there is nothing wrong with the femoral artery and distally placed arteries. However, in my experience, there have been a few cases similar with yours, where, after all the tests have been done, was concluded that the psychological effect was to be found blaming. If this is a worrisome phenomenon to you, I would recommend you to do a echo-Doppler of the arteries of the limb, to conclude if there is any problem with the arteries of that limb, related or not with the procedural puncture site. I hope I have been of help. Kind regards,Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am taking aspirin on daily basis, and Tarka 180 for hypertension, since 4 months I have done stress and echo tests for the heart they were great I have asthma also and I walk min. 2Km per day and practice GYM, today I took 2 aged garlic capsules and after 20 minutes I felt some shortness in my breath and some chest discomfort lasts for about 10 minutes and redness in the face. what is the reason? Is there any risk?","Doctor":"Greetings. Welcome to HCM and thank you for your question. I understand your concern. Blood pressure figures aim is to keep it under 140/90 mmHg. This is because, it is estimated and confirmed that figures above those mentioned, if for a long time, can cause various organ damages, especially in the kidneys and the eyes. If you are constantly experiencing figures higher than these, you can switch the dosage of verapamil/trandolapril (Tarka) 180/2 mg, to 240/4 mg. It is slow release, and provides safe and effective blood pressure control, and is especially indicated in patients with bronchial obstruction diseases (such as asthma, where beta-blockers are counterindicated). Meanwhile, asthma typically produces shortness of breath. While chest discomfort is not a common event in asthmatic patients, it may happen, and is dedicated to the bronchial spasm or obstruction. My opinion is that nothing is wrong with the heart, judging also from the fact that echocardiogram and cardiac stress test were both normal. Should there be ischemic heart disease or coronary artery disease, they would become obvious with these tests. I hope I was helpful. Take care.

I think it's a very high dose of Aspirin you are currently taking and i dint find any information as to why you are such a high dose . Also yours symptoms can be explained by overactive Thyroid gland and i suggest you start from there although your blood pressure and pulse seem to be normal. First get a blood thyroid hormone levels checked. That includes Free T3 T4 and TSH.  If it is abnormal you need to take therapy for that.Also you need to speak to your Physician as to cutting down Aspirin dosage and if you need it at all as you run a high risk of Stomach ulcer with that.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I wake up in the morning with pain from my neck down my left arm and into the left side of my chest.

The pain you describe can occur due to a cardiac disease but in such a case is usually associated with breathlessness,  lightheadedness and is not specific to early mornings. For starters you can get an ECG to see if its abnormal.However having said that i think in your case the pain is neurological and is probably due to a nerve getting entrapped in your cervical spine usually due to spondylosia of the cervical spine. Also changing the sleeping position may help. For the pain you need to get an xray of the cervical spine and if necessary use a soft cervical collar to relax your neck muscles.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I recently had an incident at work, unprovoked, that caused my heart beat to go over 112 and my BP to 178/98.

What should I do.","Doctor":"Greetings, Welcome to Health Care Magic and thank you for your question. I understand your concern. Indeed, in states where there is a lot of psychological stress there is an abnormal increase in the heart rate and blood pressure. All types anxieties are accompanied with an acute raise of adrenalin levels in the body, and these are adrenalin symptoms. Referring to the intermittent premature ventricular contractions (PVC), your stress, I would recommend you to be started on a beta-blocker, which acts both on the heart rate and PVCs, also on the anxiety. Propranolol is the name of this agent, and I recommend you to discuss with your cardiologist, about the dosage and frequency of oral administration. Another alternative is a consult with a clinical psychologist or a psychiatrist, about the possibility to be started on a short, low-dosage, course of benzodiazepines (7-10 days) and, if this anxiety is severely affecting your quality of life and work, an anti-psychotic for a short time, to regulate the mood swings generated by you anxiety attacks.

Although both are excellent medication for reducing BP, bystolic (nebivolol) has the natural property of reducing the heart  rate of the individual besides lowering the blood pressure. That is why you are seeing pulse dropping to 56 and 60...In general it is good to maintain the pulse between 60 to 100..

Usually this pain comes one or two hours after eating food. This kind of pain is relieved with antacids and proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole.

However it would have easier for me to talk about his prognosis (future health), if I had known his age, whether he had a heart attack before, what kind of therapy he is currently receiving, and any specific cause identified for the cardiomyopathy. These will have a strong bearing on how long he continues to live. I hope he is receiving the best possible medical therapy which will include drugs like ACE inhibitors/Angiotensin receptor blockers, beta blockers, aldosterone antagonists as these are known to prolong life in these patients. However the specific choice of drugs will depend on his history and other findings that are picked up by your treating physician. Besdies medication there are even device therapies like the implantable cardioverter defibrillator or the left ventricular assist device which have clearly shown to increase life span of the cardiomyopathy if the patient is fit to receive them.

Yours respectfully,Lin.","Doctor":"Hi Mrs LinI totally understand your concerns.At the same time, I wish to ally your fears a bit.It is unfortunate that he has been diagnosed with hypertension(high blood pressure) at this young age. Although having hypertension, puts him at a risk for future cardiovascular illnesses such as ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, several studies have shown that with the adequate life style changes and regular medications, these risks can be significantly reduced. The progression of the disease can be slowed to a great extent with these medication. Some of the medication for hypertension are extremely safe and do not affect the quality of life such as losartan, telmisartan, olmesartan.. His GP will guide him in this anyways..In fact people could live much longer with hypertension than what you just mentioned. Drug therapy is essential in his situation besides salt restriction and some kinds of relaxation techniques including spiritual exercises would do him a world of good. Taking too much stress upon himself is not a good thing to do and it is good for him to take breaks. Apart from this he can lead a normal life style like anybody else and so you must not be too worried at this stage.

Right bundle branch block is associated with several structural heart diseases. But it appears that they are very less likely to be present in your case, from the history and the ECG & Echo report. Isolated right bundle branch block is known to occur in several healthy individuals and there are so many studies done to prove that when they exist alone without any other heart disease they do not affect the long term health of the person.Weakness could be because of many reasons. Did you check your hemoglobin? Please consider checking it, as iron deficiency anemia is one of the common causes of such weakness. High cholesterol will not cause weakness usually.

So I recommend consulting with your GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a chest X ray study, an abdominal ultrasound and some blood lab tests : -complete blood count-PCR, sedimentation rate (inflammation)-kidney and liver function tests-thyroid hormone levels-blood electrolytes-fasting glucose-cotisol and aldosteron plasma levels ( adrenal gland function)-thyroid hormone levels (thyroid function). The levels of metanephrines in your 24 hours collected urine may be needed to investigate for possible pheochromocytoma.

Besides this Atorvastatin will also reduce cholesterol. In some patients cholesterol is high inspite of taking atorvastatin maximum dose. In such patients drugs like storfib are given which contains another medicine called fenofibrate along with atorvastatin. Do you have high cholesterol? How is your LDL & HDL cholesterol? If your cholesterol is normal, then you can continue taking only atorvastatin. The period is usually indefinite once the age is above 50 years."},{"Patient":"Hi. Have gon e through a right coronary angioplasty 6 weeks back. 43 years 5'11 and 94kgs. Having hopace 2.5mg tad, ecospirin, tanact 40mg oad, nutrikit, parsudoc tad. BP used to be 120/80 when having 1.25mg of hopace a day, now 100/60 when having 5mg a day. Is all this OK?","Doctor":"HiYou need not worry about this BP reading of 100/60. This reduction in BP is expected with a hopace dose of 5 mg. As long as the systolic blood pressure is above 90 mmHg (the first reading) all your organs are receiving adequate blood supply from your heart and you need not worry. In case you develop a dizziness, particularly while getting up in the morning, or too much light headedness, then you can consult your physician and he may suggest to modify the drug dosage.  Wishing you good health!!"},{"Patient":"My son went for his yearly physical and was told his cholesterol was too high, 270 and white count low. He is a very active 16 yr. old. Weighs about 136 stands about 5'10. He's very passionate about his sports so he doesnt put junk in his body. Im just wondering in his case if its all hereditary?","Doctor":"HiI do not think you have to be worried too much about the total cholesterol of 270. I assume this value is the total cholesterol.  Although it is high, I would be more interested to know what is LDL cholesterol. Usually the LDL target is to be maintained at less than 100. Once you find the LDL value, try non pharmacologic measures of bringing down cholesterol levels by exercise and diet. If this does not reduce you might have to start him on statin therapy (eg.atorvastatin)  after consulting a physician. I would NOT worry too much on a single isolated low WBC count. Does he frequently fall sick and develop infections? If not, I doubt the lab report and would not give too much importance to it. The low WBC count values is unrelated to cholesterol values. Familial Hypercholesterolemia is hereditary cause for high cholesterol and is due to certain genetic abnormalities. This can be confirmed only by doing certain genetic tests to look for specific mutations in certain genes. Though there is a strong possibility that this could be hereditary, i dsuggest you do a complete lipid profile first. An LDL greater than 190 mg % and a total cholesterol greater than 290 mg is suggestive of a hereditary cause for elevated cholesterol in young individuals. Hope this helps.."},{"Patient":"sir my PTCA was done in Dec.2010.since then I am taken monit 20 at 8am& 3pm,seloken xl25,clopigrel75 at 9am,nikoran5 and ecosprin150 after lunch, rosuvas20at 6pm and nicoran5 after dinner.Should i continue these medicines ?

But unfortunately It is difficult to make a decision about all these medication without knowing your angio report and PTCA report, your age, risk factors status, past hospitalization history. If I were treating a situation like this I would consider stopping nikoran and monotrate if chest pain has totally ceased.  I would certainly continue rosuvas and ecosprin. These medicines are great in preventing further heart attacks. Seloken and clopidogrel may be required depending on your reports.

I suggest you discuss this with your treating physician as there are plenty of alternate options in both the category of drugs. Nebistar is nebivolol, a beta blocker. Some of the drugs in this category are known to cause nightmares, difficulty in sleep and in my opinion I would consider changing the drug class to some other category like ACE inhibitors or Angiotensin receptor blockers. These are alternate drug class of drug for the same condition and are very less likely to cause disturbances in your sleep. Novastat can sometimes cause difficulty in sleeping though nightmares are uncommon. You may discuss this with your physician in your next visit. Hope I answered your queries. We can know for sure which of these is causing the problem by stopping the drug to see how the problem resolves or not. But this should be done only under the guidance of your treating physician."},{"Patient":"my sister just had surgery to remove hernia had one removed 3 years ago so much scar tissue so hernia removed through abdomin due to scar tissue. Since surgery she has had an irregulat heart rate getting as high as 160.  She has previously been diagnosed with atrial fibulation.  Could that be causing irradic heat rate","Doctor":"HiAtrial Fibrillation is a condition in which there is irregular heart rate. This occurs as the electrical impulses are not occurring through the normal pathway. It is very unlikely that the hernia and surgery could trigger the fibrillation. Is she on medication for atrial fibrillation? Have they found the cause for the atrial fibrillation? Many times treating the cause of atrial fibrillation will relieve the fibrillation to a great extent. Depending on whether she has persistent or intermittent atrial fibrillation the treatment for her will vary. So I suggest that you ask her to visit her physician and get a complete evaluation. Hope I answered your question.I hope she is also taking blood thinning agents"},{"Patient":"Within the past 3 months I started experiencing heart fluttering on an irregular basis maybe a couple of times a week at different times of the day.  I was concerned so I went to the AZ Heart Institute for a test and they gave me a calcium score of 104 which is considered moderate.  The site was in the lower anterior ventricule.  I exercise at least 4 times a week to include cardio work on a machine for roughly 40 minutes trying to keep my heart between 120 and 160.  Do i just need to focus more on a healthier lifestyle or be worried at this point?  My cholesterol on my last test was 150, triglycerides -111, HDL was 32.  All other blood work was normal with exception of Hematocrit which was 39.9.  What should I be concerned about?","Doctor":"HiI understand from your description that you are experiencing palpitations on and off for the last three months. Palpitations could arise because of certain electrical disturbances in the heart which are termed as arrhythmiaWhen you visited the hospital did they take an ECG? Was it normal? Sometimes certain arrhythmias cannot be detected on an ECG and you might then require a Holter Monitor. As far as your cholesterol is concerned it is well within the normal range. Even your hematocrit is in the normal range and I would not be concerned about it. I do not think you should worry too much at the moment about your calcium score if you are  not currently diabetic, hypertensive and doing regular exercise as you do. Your calcium score will not be be having anyh bearing on the fluttering that you are complaining of.If you really are getting disturbed by these palpitations, get yourselves examined by a  cardiologist for cardiac arrhythmia so that the exact cause can be identified and treated accordingly. Usually Holter and a physical examination may reveal clues besides ECG. Hope I answered your question"},{"Patient":"I am constantly anxious, my heart races and I get palpatation, now severe heartburn and night sweats so bad I completely soak my pillows and sheets. My family is prone to heart problems. I'm 33 now and concerned. Is this anxiety or something more serious?","Doctor":"HiFrom the way you describe your symptoms, in my opinion I am more inclined to believe that you might be having Generalized Anxiety Disorder. But before coming to that diagnosis, I would want to evaluate your heart and vascular function. I would like to know if you are diabetic, hypertensive, smoking, under constant emotional stress. The reason I would want to know this is that these are risk factors to develop heart disease later and so they are to be treated now. An ECG may be done though it is most likely that you would have a normal one, but it is better to confirm it. Having a family history of heart disease DOES NOT make you 100% likely to get heart disease. It is possible that you may never get it too. Once I am sure that your heart is normal I would suggest you to meet  a psychiatrist who routinely treats Generalized Anxiety Disorder. There are several behavioural therapies that may help you apart from drugs and the psychiatrist is the best person to help you in this. Some of the medicines that may use include fluoxetine, paroxetine citalopram, buspirone. Since these are prescription medicines, it is best you consult the psychiatrist. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"MHV (mitral valve) is in my son, he got diagnosed with CAVSD, on anticoagulant every day and has had 3 major surgeries at 5-6 months of age.

Did he have a heart attack earlier? Did he have any other illness prior to this time that required hospitalization? Most likely its is the echocardiography report that would have been mentioned as Ejection Fraction - 25%. It indicates the efficiency of the heart which in your dad's case is on the lower side. Once he comes out of this current period of hospitalization, it is essential that he takes his medicines regularly which may include medicines to reduce the amount of work that his heart performs by reducing the bodys water content(diuretic). There are several other effective medication too which can be prescribed depending on his blood pressure and other factors. I am sure your physician will be able to guide you on this. Ensure that he reduces his salt and water intake. His body cannot handle too much water. Any infection especially of the lungs is to be treated promptly with antibiotics to avoid complications.

The episodes of blackouts after going for runs are a little concerning. They could be related to a low blood pressure (orthostatic hypotension), low blood glucose, hyperventilation or cardiac arrhythmia. I recommend you to consult with your GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a chest X ray study and some blood lab tests : -complete blood count- thyroid hormone levels- blood electrolytes- kidney and liver function tests - fasting glucose. A treadmill test may be necessary to exclude possible cardiac arrythmia related to physical exercise. You should discuss with your doctor on the above mentioned issues. Hope to have been of help!

I just want to know whether chicken is bad for me or not.","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!I understand your concern and would explain that there is no harm in eating chicken in your clinical situation. Instead white meat like chicken and fish are recommended because of their low level in fat and other benefits to your digestive tract. I would recommend you to modify your diet by reducing salt intake and caffeine intake, which are known to increase your blood pressure. Besides, physical activity (walking, aerobics) would be also helpful in reducing your blood pressure.

My understandig is that you have suffered a heart attack (myocardial infarction) and have got a PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) done with a stent placed in the coronary vessels that caused the infarction. In this stage you are considered cured.Amusement parks and roller-coasters during their rides produce joy and excitement by raising adrenaline and othes stress hormone levels. This means tht the heart has to respond to these stressed condition with faster heartbeats which means more work for the heart and also there is the possibility of stress induced coronary artery spasms which may lead to chest pain and myocardial infarction.My opinion is that you should undergo one of the functional stress test  exercise ecg, stress echocardiography or nuclear stress test. After the test you will know how your heart responds on a sressed conditions and if the test resoults are good than I would say that you can enjoy amusement parks in moderation.I hope you got the answer you were seeking.

About two months ago I was drinking and threw up and then that morning I had a jaw pain that felt like it was in the nerves of my back teeth in my lower jaw.","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!I understand your concern and would explain that it is important to perform a careful differential diagnosis of your symptomatology. A radicular disorder, related to a cervico thoracal disc disorder could mimic this clinical scenario. From the other hand an gastro esophageal reflux  or any other gastroesophgeal disorders (esophageal spasms, etc) could explain the pain after throwing up. Besides, the symptoms related to your heart (flutters), raise the suspicions of a possible cardiac disorder (cardiac arrhythmia and ischemia). What is your age? What about your past medical history? I recommend consulting with your GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG and cardiac ultrasound, a chest X ray study and some blood lab tests : -complete blood count-PCR, sedimentation rate-fasting glucose-blood electrolytes-kidney and liver function tests, etc. A cervical spine X ray followed by a possible CT scan may be needed if suspicions of a possible cervical column disorder are raised. I recommend discussing with your doctor on the above issues.

This medication is being taken for controlling a High blood pressure in conjunction with irregular heart beats in 50 yr male.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!I understand your concern and would explain that cialis interacts with both metoporolol and losartan by pharmacological synergism, leading to an increase of their effect on lowering blood pressure. This means that you may be at risk of low blood pressure when taking Cialis while on this antihypertensive therapy. Although, Cialis intake is not contraindicated in this case. It should be used with caution. I recommend to closely monitor your blood pressure during taking Cialis.

One physician recommends medication, but I am unsure.","Doctor":"Greetings! Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. I am going to try to address your issue with my opinion and standpoint on it. Normal blood pressure figures standardized for the worldwide population are as follows: 100-139 mmHg systolic and 60-89 mmHg. I would not refer to your condition as hypertension, but, combining with your age of 71 years old, my opinion is that medical treatment with one blood pressure-lowering agent would be recommended. The aim at your age would be to keep these figures under 135/85 mmHg constant, and avoid any possible end-organ damage by long-standing figures above the ones I provided. Also, most of agents used to lower the blood pressure are safe, with low rate of side effects and effective. You should consult your treating doctor about the precise agent that should be installed in your treatment, but my opinion is that it should be from the class of beta-blockers or verapamil or diltiazem from the calcium-channel blockers. These agents, besides lowering the blood pressure, also have effect on the heart rate, which promotes the heart's efficiency, by reducing its workload. This is my opinion and my recommendation. The choice is always yours. Wish you a good health and I hope I was helpful. Kind regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have come across a strange case. My father in law had a stent out in a couple of months back. Now since then he has been fine and in fact even going fr regular afternoon walks. Now he switched to evening walk (just after nap) and he started getting a little bit of breathlessness -after which he rested after a little bit of walking.its not always but then he noticed that if he goes for a walk in evening rather than just before lunch - he sees a little bit of breathlessness. He has had a cough and te medication changed recently too. Any idea on why this may be happening and if it norm? Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I carefully read your query. Some times, there is a good possibility that coronary artery disease can be presented in an \\"atypical\\" pattern - meaning, without chest pain - with shortness of breath, palpitations, epigastric pain, malaise etc. Since he also is a stent patient, I would recommend him to do a cardiac stress test, to see if there is any evidence or coronary artery disease or problem with the implanted stent. I assume that the curing doctor explained to him that there is a probability of within stent narrowing, after successful implantation. In case of bare metal stents, this probability is 16-25%, and in case of drug-eluting stents, this probability is 4-8%, depending on the stent coating. Hence, my recommendation for a control, so, even if this is nothing to worry about and the stent is fine, at least we can exclude the cardiac and coronary origin with higher probability. If the cardiac stress test results come back positive, then another coronary angiography to check the native arteries and the stent, would be appropriate. Also, if this stent was implanted in a scenario of acute myocardial infarction, the infarcted muscle itself can damage one wall of the heart and, therefore, drop the function of the heart. If this is the case, then the shortness of breath may come from the raised pressures in an insufficient heart, which causes high pressures in \\"upper floors\\" - the lungs, hence the shortness of breath. If this is the case, I recommend him to discuss with his doctor about the possibility of adding furosemide and spironolactone (depending on the heart function) on the therapy. The shortness of breath can primarily come also from the lungs or any change in the airways. I would also recommend a plain postero-anterior and lateral chest X-ray. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Wish you a good health.

Ther are many other reasons he cardiac enzymes could be elevated.   If your kidneys do not clear the enzymes from your body they will be elevated. Congestive heart failure can cause your cardiac enzymes to be elevated.  If you do not take in enough oxygen especially at night and you have like obstructive sleep apnea, this can cause your heart to be starved of oxygen and therefore leaked cardiac enzymes.   If you want heart is working very hard due to  hard breathing,  on infection, this can raise your cardiac enzymes.  As long as you had a full workup, which it looks like you have, I would keep an eye on it and not worry about it.  If you however started to have shortness of breath with minimal activities, then you will need to show up to a cardiologist or the emergency department for further workup.

However, you have to visit your family doctor soon. He is the best person who can help you to diagnose and treat your condition  because he is very much familiar with your family history, history of other illness you had in past, medications you used or presently on etc.  Therefore, I strongly recommend you to book an appointment and see your family doctor immediately.         Anyway your condition can be a type of Arrhythmia. Skipping heart beats are very much likely to be Extrasystoles which can be either premature atrial or ventricular contractions that you feel as skipping your heart beat. This is a very common condition, however, ECG testing and if necessary 24-hour ECG recording ( Holter monitoring) has to be done to make the correct diagnosis.  Sometimes your doctor will direct you to blood tests and ECHO test if needed.  Do not worry. See your family doctor and  explain him all your symptoms and he will come up with solutions. If you have further questions, please let me know.Good luck!Dr. Dinesh Nuwan Weerasinghe ( MD)"},{"Patient":"Left arm tinglesIm a 15 year old female, not sexually active.

Recently I have been experiencing a rapid heart beat at various times during the day.  It comes and quickly goes away.  I have low blood pressure.  I am under a considerable amount of stress.  I have been attributing it to that but am wondering if I should contact my internist/cardiologist for an appt.  Just had my yearly physical and ekg. 6 months ago and everything was normal","Doctor":"Greetings! Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I carefully read your query. Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a benign condition that is estimated to be found in 16% of young ladies, and it may take up to forty or fifty years to produce symptoms, only after a chronic mitral regurgitation is installed. I would go on and say that further clinical investigation should be in order at this time, but I am quite confident that, if something was wrong with the mitral valve and the mitral regurgitation was there, it would have been told to you during the before 6 months echocardiogram. It would be only when a mitral regurgitation produced by a mitral valve prolapse that would enlarge the left atrium, when the high pressures in the enlarged left atrium would produce shortness of breath and, maybe, rapid heart rate corresponding with a atrial arrhythmia. And it would have shown in the echocardiogram, if the left atrium was enlarged. My opinion is that your problem is not being produced by the mitral valve prolapse, at this moment, at least. However, if this a worrisome situation to you, then another echocardiogram should be done. Of course, if mitral valve is found on a bad shape, after carefully measuring the function, size, and grade of regurgitation, adding to the possible symptoms, it is only then when mitral valve should be surgically replaced. As for the stress side, indeed substantial amounts of stress have their clear effect on the heart, by putting it to a significant dynamic state and by producing adrenalin that acts directly or indirectly in your heart electrical and conduction system. There are a lot of natural means to reduce stress, starting from self-fighting of the stress to yoga or other methods. If this becomes problematic to you and affects your quality of life and work, I would recommend you a consult with a clinical psychologist regarding a course of sedatives to reduce it. I hope I was helpful. Best regards.

Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I carefully read your query. As I am let to understand, coronary angiogram was performed. Well, there are different strategies on treating a narrowed or totally blocked coronary artery. It would be really helpful to see the full report and the film. However, I am going to try to address your issue. First, there is angioplasty and stenting of the artery. If the time from onset of a severe, different from others, episode of chest pain to angioplasty is less than six hours, then the benefits on the heart muscle is the highest. I am, of course, referring to a totally closed coronary artery which caused an acute myocardial infarction. If there is a significant blockage to the main artery, and I am assuming that this is the left main coronary artery or the very beginning of the left anterior descendent artery, then the strategy of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) provides more benefit in aspects of lifespan and symptom ameliorating. If this is a blockage in the proximal or midden portion of the LAD artery, then angioplasty and stent placement would be the appropriate strategy, with safety and effectiveness. Drug therapy is not an option to opening blockages in coronary arteries, since they, at best, only can stop the progression of the coronary artery disease. As I one mentioned above, if I would see the angiography film, I would be more specific and precise with my recommendations. I hope this helps. Take care.

Here are some lifestyle modifications that would help you reduce your triglycerides:- Lose weight. If you’re overweight.-Reduce the sugar intake and avoid high speed absorbable sugar. - Consume as much as possible fiber-rich foods, such as vegetables, fruits and whole grains.-Limit fructose. The fructose contained in some foods and even the fructose that's found naturally in fruits can increase triglycerides. Dried fruits, such as raisins and dates, have the most fructose, whereas peaches, cantaloupe, grapefruit, strawberries and bananas are relatively low in fructose.-A moderately low-fat diet.-Reduce the quatity of saturated fats, which are found in red meat,  butter, cheese, milk, and coconut and palm oils. You can use white meat instead (fish, chicken).  - Use safflower, corn and soybean oils. Olive oil would be excellent. -Add omega-3 fatty acids. Fatty fish such as salmon, herring, sardines, lake trout and albacore tuna are abundant in omega-3 fatty acids—a type of fat that is actually good for you. - Exercise. It is recommended 4km of walking, or 30 minutes per day. Exercise is also an important part of keeping your weight under control. Aerobics would also be helpful. -Finally, you should avoid alcohol intake. I agree with your doctor's choices on your therapy.

The use of warfarin throughout pregnancy carries a risk of embryopathy of about 6%;This risk is possibly lower with a warfarin dose Substitution of warfarin with un-fractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin from the 6th to the 12th week of pregnancy eliminates the risk of embryopathy.Anyway warfarin appears to be safer for the mother with a lower incidence of thromboembolic events than unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin.So you should make the decision to continue on warfarine, which is more safe but carries 6% risk of possible fetal abnormalities, or start subcutaneous heparin which is more safe for the baby, but not as safe for you. Regarding  anticoagulation, required dosages during pregnancy for all anticoagulants can differ from dosages outside pregnancy. The risk of valve thrombosis with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin is probably lower when aggressive dose-adjustment takes place, based on monitoring of APTT or anti-Xa levels; They may need to be administered 3 times daily, because the increase of glomerular filtration.

A prolonged chest pain and numbness is indicative of an extracardiac disorder. Is your pain modulated by respiration or body movements? This would be more indicative of a musculo skeletal pain.

Lexapro chronic use can lead to ECG changes , which can induce a cardiac arrhythmia. From the other hand, anxiety (related to a lower dose than needed of lexapro) may mimic this clinical scenario. I recommend performing : - a resting ECG- a chest x ray study - thyroid hormone levels- blood electrolytes. An ambulatory 24-48 hours monitoring may be necessary to exclude a possible cardiac arrhythmia. If all the above tests result normal, I recommend following your doctors advise to increase the frequency and dose of lexapro.

Does she have fevers?If she doesn't have fevers or any other symptoms (like numbness, hand swelling, etc), it can wait up to next week for a doctor consult. If she has fevers or other of the above mentioned symtoms, you should consult with the doctor for a careful physical examination and some lab blood tests (complete blood count, coagulation tests, PCR, sedimentation rate).

What does this mean and should I go to a cardiologist? I started a low dose aspirin about a month ago because my heart seemed to be beating faster or harder for a second or two at times, not often.","Doctor":"Hello I am Dr Mody and I would be addressing your concern, The reason for those extra beats can be 1) anxiety : because of anxiety more adrenaline is pumped into your circulation causing those extra beats 2) levoxyl : levoxyl can itself cause extra beats.  Whenever there is over treatment of by thyroid hormone there may be a state of hyperthyroidism,  which may cause arrhythmia ranging from just increase in normal heart beats,  extra beats or some times irregular beats.  3) there is no role of aspirin in extra beats,  except when ischaemia / angina is the reason of those extra beats It's better if you can get a fresh thyroid profile (Tsh, free t3/t4) and adjust the dose of thyroxine. As such extra beats are benign and so if no symptoms because of it,  you may ignore the same.  The only reason the cause has to be determined is to prevent further arrhythmia.

For the last day or two I have been feeling a little faint and have been experiencing mild but noticeable heart palpitations. I am a healthy weight, my diet is good, I ensure I am drinking plenty of fluids and have no serious health issues.

A chronic anemia can exacerbate this condition. I recommend you to closely monitor your blood pressure in sitting and standing up position. A decrease more than 20mm Hg in your systolic blood pressure in standing up position, compared to sitting position would be indicative of an orthostatic hypotension. A head up tilt test would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

A musculo skeletal pain and pain related to pleuritis could be modulated by the respiratory movements, but would not be related to the tobacco chewing. Another disorder would be esophageal spasms or gastritis, which would be exacerbated by the tobacco chewing. Have you tried to take any painkillers (acetaminophen, ibuprofen)or PPIs (lansoprazole, omeprazole)?The pain relief from painkillers would indicate a musculoskeletal pain. The pain relief from PPIs would indicate a gastro esophageal disorder.

The latest would explain the feeling of fainting. On the one hand, these effects seem to be dose dependent, but on the other hand, the frequent use over a relatively short period of time results in tolerance. This means that after smoking regularly for some time, your body gets used to marijuana effects and you don't experience such symptoms when smoking marijuana any more. But, I would recommend consulting with a GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a chest x ray and some blood lab tests (complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, blood electrolytes, fasting glucose, etc), to rule out any possible underlying conditions. Meanwhile I would advise you to avoid smoking marijuana, because of these side effects on your cardio-vascular system and other side effects on different body organs.

I carefully read your question and i understand your concern. I will try to give you my opinion.There is no relationship between playing a videogame and a heart problem.The only think that might explain what you feel is related with the emotion or stress that you feel wile you play this game or the body position. The pain might be related with a body position, it might be a musculus-sceletik pain that you feel each time you play.It is possible that during the game, because of emotions you might experience a little sinus tachycardia, that means that your heart beats over 100 beat for minute and you experience this like a heart discomfort, that ends immediately when you finish playng and you get relaxed again.I think this is nothing serious. If it really bothers you, you can take a holter rhythm monitoring that can register your heart during this episodes. After this we can better understand what is it and what to do.Hope I was helpful.

I carefully read your question and i understand your concern. I will try to explain you something.There are tree different ways to treat artery stenosis or blockage. These are what we call angioplasty with balloon, angioplasty with stents and surgery  or coronary artery by pass. Angioplasty with balloon and stent means that we open the blockage using a balloon or a  \\"metallic\\" structure that we call stents that is putted into the blocked artery to maintain it open.The selection of each of them depends on the number of stenosis, the position of the stenosis, the heart function and a lot of other factors and organ function.In general, in our daily practice a tree vessel disease is treated with surgery as your doctors already has told you.We use coronary stent-ing in people that does not support or want surgery if this is anatomically possible and this of course depend on the doctors experience.It is mandatory to see the anatomy of coronary artery and evaluate the patient to give a good opinion.Hope I was helpful.

You have just a little beat  much high frequencies maybe because of stress.But if you are not treating your atrial fibrillation I would not recommend you to travel or fly. Because very high frequencies generated by stress may lead to unpleasant events.

I ll jump up really fast and it goes away!! Im scared","Doctor":"Hello erica and thank you for using HCM. I carefully read your question and i understand your concern.Don't worry, this is nothing serious and you are not having a heart attach.As you describe, my opinion is that we are dealing with a rhythm issue.Someone might feel fast and jumping heart beats for different reasons. It might be a sinus tachycardia, a supra ventricular tachycardia or what we call paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.This all are rhythm disturbances, electrical impulses generating from the heart which beats over 100 beat for minute, they might come and go. The heart might have its normal sinus rhythm or loos it and work in a chaotic way.All this rhythm issues gives you the sensation that your heart jumps and runs fast.You are not having a heart attack. A heart attach is manifested with a very heard chest pain and different complications. Yours are just rhythm problems.If i was your treating doctor i will recommend you to do some simple exams like a blood sample to look for anemia, hyperthyroidism. An electrocardiogram, echo-cardiography and a holter monitoring to see the rhythm tendency. After these we will have a better view. Don't worry because it might be just stress or  if it is a rhythm disorder you can treat it with medications.Hope I was helpful.

Your past medical history for diverticulitis and colon cancer could be related to these symptoms. But a common viral gastro enteritis as the cause of this symptomatology can not be excluded. I recommend consulting with your gastroenterologist for a careful physical examination, an abdominal ultrasound, a stool analysis, some lab blood tests including: a complete blood count, PCR, sedimentation rate, CEA, CA19.9 (tumor antigenes), etc. A GI endoscopy is necessary to exlude possible lesions of the digestive tract if suspicions are raised.

A complete check up by your GP, including : -resting ECG-chest x ray study-head up tilt test for orthostatic hypotension-lab blood tests (complete blood count, fasting glucose, PCR, sedimentation rate, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes, thyroid hormone levels, cortisol plasma levels, etc), are necessary to rule in/out the above mentioned disorders.

Anxiety could be the cause of this clinical scenario (high blood pressure). But an episode of high blood pressure, measured at the doctor office, doesn't indicate for sure arterial hypertension. It may be just a \\"white coat syndrome\\", which means that her blood pressure results higher when monitored by the doctor, maybe from the anxiety and fear related to the doctor consult or the hospital.

Since you are overweight, control your eating habits & stop taking junk & oily food. Cut on salt intake. Take fiber, calcium & minerals in your diet. Stay away from addictions if any.

Should I be concerned and what might be some potential issues that they could be looking for?","Doctor":"Hi,If your son plays football and gave no complaint, it is already a good sign.But if your doctor  called you for echocardiography and holter monitoring, it means he noticed something abnormal, most probably some arrhythmia.Sometimes there are slight abnormalities or arrhythmias on ECG without any disease and are not dangerous at all. Anyway if we notice something abnormal, we should go further and have some additional examinations done to be sure that there is nothing serious and dangerous.So, you shouldn't worry, just wait for your appointment and results.

Your symptoms don't seem to be cardiac related. So don't worry about that!Have you measured your blood pressure and heart rate during these episodes? Is this pain modulated by respiration or body movements? This would be more indicative for a musculo skeletic pain. Chostochondritis could also mimic this symptomatologyA gastro esophageal disorder (like esophageal spasms, gastro esophageal reflux, gastritis etc.) could mimic these symptoms. I recommend consulting with your GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a chest x ray and some blood lab tests: - complete blood count - PCR, sedimentation rate (inflammation)- kidney and liver function tests- fasting glucose- thyroid hormone levels (a thyroid dysfunction could explain the shakes)- cortisol plasma levels (adrenal gland function)- blood electrolytes, etc. A GI endoscopy would be necessary to exclude a possible gastro esophageal disorder. If all the above mentioned tests, result normal, the main cause of your symptoms would be just anxiety and psychological stress. In such case, you should consult with a specialist of this field to help you manage your anxiety.

Also the skin on my breasts sometimes looks like purply thin small veins. Lately i also have been getting dizzy spells.Thanks","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!I understand your concern and would like to explain that there are different causes related to your symptomatology. You should know that dehydration, loss of the fat tissue when losing weight, malnutrition and skin thinning and some drugs (like steroids), can induce these changes. Some metabolic disorders (like thyroid and adrenal gland dysfunction) could also lead to these small vein changes in your body. From the other hand, straining physical exercise and prolonged standing up position can induce a vein insufficiency and small vein changes, mainly in your feet. But in that case these changes would be permanent. I recommend consulting with your GP for a careful physical examination and some blood lab tests : - complete blood count- thyroid hormone levels- cortisol plasma levels- kidney and liver function tests- blood electrolytes, etc. A Doppler ultrasound of the leg vessels would be necessary. Meanwhile I recommend you to take plenty of fluids (water and juices) and a balanced diet full of vitamins and proteins.

So, I agree with her doctor that you should wait before making some changes to this therapy. From the other hand, this is a really small dose, but it is started in this way to avoid possible adverse effects related to amtas intake. So if her blood pressure is still above 130/90 mm Hg after a couple of days you should discuss with your doctor the possibility of a dose increase or adding another antihypertensive therapy.

Does he have any head spinning? What were his blood pressure values during this episode? This symptomatology could be explained by an inner ear disorder, such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo or labyrinthine inflammation. Another disorder which could mimic this clinical scenario would be a vertebro basilar TIA (transient ischemic attack). His past medical history for stroke, raises the suspicions of a TIA in the posterior circulation of the brain. I recommend consulting with the GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG and some blood lab tests (complete blood count, inflammation tests, kidney and liver function tests, fasting glucose, blood electrolytes,etc). An ENT consult coupled with the labyrinthine tests is needed to rule in/out a possible inner ear disorder. A Doppler ultrasound of the neck vessels is necessary to examine the blood flow in these vessels and the blood supply to the brain and exclude a possible vessel stenosis in this level.

You should know that the symptomatology related to the above disorders is very variable. Heartburn and burping are typical of these disorders. Anxiety and spicy foods, including coffee are known to exacerbate the situation. Have you tried to take any PPIs (omeprazole, lansoprazole, etc) or antiacids. I strongly encourage you to start taking the above mentioned drugs. The relief of your symptoms would be very indicative for such disorder. If your symptoms persist, I recommend consulting with a gastro enterologist and perform a GI endoscopy to examine better your digestive tract.

Your headache seems to be related to high blood pressure. You should know that it is one of the most common symptoms of high blood pressure. Regarding to back and shoulder pain, it may be related to a cervical disk problem or to chronic degenerative changes to your back bone. I recommend you to closely monitor your blood pressure, different times during the day at home (in sitting position, after 15 minutes of total relax) and refer these values to your GP. It is necessary to perform a complete check up by your GP including: a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a chest x ray study, a cervico -thoracic spine x ray study and some blood lab tests (complete blood count, fasting glucose, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes, inflammation tests, etc). If your blood pressure is above 130/90 mm Hg most of the time (and non episodic), you should discuss with your doctor the possibility of starting an antihypertensive therapy.

Unfortunately, brain death may be a complication of open cardiac surgery. The mechanism of death may be different depending on the type of cardiac intervention and cardiac anaesthesia (substances that are used to stop the heart in order to perform cardiac surgery). In most of the cases, the brain death is related to extra-corporal circulation and cerebral ischemia from inadequate cerebral perfusion.

(but just mild straining) nothing big.. or troublesome from last few months. which if i drink water and have regular walk goes ok.My cardiologist has just changed my current medicine from concor 2.5 (once) to telma 40(once) after i explained him above. My all reports of blood, urine, liver function, kidney function, 2D echo, TMT has come absolutely normal.My question is the change in medicine is ok ? or should i take telma 20...? my weight is 78 and height is 170. Is the problem which i am facing is due to taking BP medicine uptill now ? is there a way to manage BP and stop medicine ? Is the change from Concor 2.5 to telma 40 ok?","Doctor":"Dear Kavit Metha,It is a very good idea to change Concor to Telma. Usually I try to avoid to prescribe beta blockers (medications such as Concor) to young men.You should take Telma and see if the dose is appropriate for you, as it is quite individual.You should strictly follow healthy lifestyle, and after some time try to reduce the dose of your medication. In some young patients, we succeed to withdraw medications gradually with healthy lifestyle.Hope I could help youWishing you good healthIn case of further questions don't hesitate to askRegards,"},{"Patient":"my mother is 64, an upholsterer of furniture, smoker of 40 years, quitting now.  has copd and chf.  we have specialist appointment and i am looking for questions to ask the doctor, so i may write down and fill in family.  i do not know what to ask.  the inportant questions that maybe some patients don't know to ask?  my sister is an rn, and she is wanting all details.  like should she stop working because of other dust and dander and etc. in furniture?  should she get tests done?  if so, what ones?  she has no insurance...thank you for any help with a list of questions we should ask the pulmonary specialist?.  god bless you for answering.....","Doctor":"HiIf the suspicion is of occupational lung disease, then it is better to avoid the wood dust.You can get her investigated for complete haemogram, eosinophil count,chest X-ray, pulmonary Function tests,Sputum culture,hrct if required.All the best."},{"Patient":"I'm 17 and over the past week I have checked my blood pressure everyday at varying times and everytime it was between 135/80 and 145/83.

Regarding your concern, I would explain that your EEG results are indicative for an epileptic focus in your brain, which generates seizures. This means that in your left fronto-temporal region of the brain, there is an area, which is not functioning well and generates epileptic discharges in the brain cells, leading to seizures. You should know that your seizures are not going to stop without therapy. You need to perform a brain MRI with some specific sequences for epilepsy and consult with the neurosurgeon about a possible intervention. If your seizures are controlled by antiepileptic therapy (and you refuse surgery or it is not possible), you need to stay on this therapy for your entire life (as long as the epileptic focus is inside your brain).

I go through periods of a few days when it happens much more. I also feel very lightheaded, my heart pounds, it is harder to breathe, and I feel like I m going to pass out while in the shower, and my heart also pounds and races when I wake up from naps. Are these symptoms of Orthostatic Hypotension/POTS, or should I get my blood taken/see a doctor?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!I understand your concern and would explain that these symptoms can be related to orthostatic hypotension. The fact that your symptoms are triggered by standing up position, is an argument in favor of these disorders. But a chronic anemia as well as some metabolic disorders could mimic this clinical scenario (or exacerbate the POTS symptomatology)So I recommend consulting with your GP for a careful physical examination and some blood lab tests: - complete blood count (for chronic anemia)- Ferritine and hemosiderine plasma levels (chronic anemi)- thyroid hormone levels (thyroid function)- cortisol plasma levels (adrenal gland function)- fasting glucose- kidney and liver function tests- blood electrolytes, etc.Meanwhile, I would recommend taking plenty of fluids (water, juices), avoid straining physical activity and have a balanced diet.

He has a lump that hurts, near his diaphragm. His heart rate is over 200 and his doctor says my roommate had a mild stroke a couple of weeks ago. He has been experiencing arrhythmia recently also. I m really concerned. Shane spends sleepless nights trying to breathe. Shane said the doctor put him on a blood pressure med to reduce his heart rate and that the MRI of his brain showed no bleeders. Shane is seeking care; I m just worried. Thank you, Valerie","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!I understand your concern and would explain that his symptoms seem to be related to a cardiac arrhythmia. What is his age? What about his past medical history? What are his blood pressure values?Has he had any fevers during these days? The painful lump on his chest may be an infection or a lymph node. The facts that it hurts, means that it is inflammatory. I recommend consulting with the GP for a careful physical examination (including the inspection of the lump), a resting ECG, a chest x ray and some blood lab tests: - complete blood count- PCR, sedimentation rate (inflammation tests)- kidney and liver function tests- fasting glucose- thyroid hormone levels (thyroid gland function)- cortisol plasma levels (adrenal gland function)- blood electrolytes, etc.A 24-48 hours ECG monitoring is necessary to rule in/out a possible cardiac arrhythmia. A biopsy of the lump on his chest may be needed to determine its nature (infectious, inflammatory, etc). A 24 hours urinary metanephrines test for possible pheochromocytoma should be performed if his episodes of tachycardia are associated with high blood pressure and other symptoms (pale skin, sweating, etc).

He was not responding to anyone. He had low blood pressure and a UTI. For weeks his lips were purple and a decline in eating and drinking pureed foods. He has PD late stage and had triple by-pass 10 yrs. ago. He has been in a nursing home for almost two months. Could this have been avoided - the UTI and dehydration?","Doctor":"Hello,  I am Dr Mody and I would be addressing your concern,  Dehydration was the primary problem and most probably it was due to poor oral intake. This is extremely common in PD patients.  Now when you are dehydrated your body tends to conserve the maximum water as possible,  helping to fall in urine out and this concentrated urine may be a good medium for infection,  again the infection will result in further fall in urine and the cycle goes on.  The long hospital stay might be due to many Co morbidity  he suffers from.  Though it could not have been completely averted,  however timely intervention could have resulted in less severe form and resulted in early recovery.  I do recommend hospice care even post discharge to prevent a repeat episode.

It is this decrease in body sodium that causes a little  slurring of speech / slowed mentation. So if it was only for a short time,  that is the most common reason.  Oxygen per say will not cause slurring rather it's decrease in oxygen which causes drowsiness.

I will try to give you my opinion. In fact, as you describe your mom has a complicated heart history.As she had done a heart attach and it is a confirmed ischemic heart disease corrected with stents it is mandatory to have a slow heart rate.It is our goal when we treat ischemic heart disease to have slow heart rates. As the heart has problems with normal blood supply throught the coronary artery it is mandatory to lower the heart work. So, through medications we lower the frequency, the blood pressure to makes thinks easier for the suffering heart. So you don't have nothing to worry for these frequency. The frequency between 45-50 its quite normal.I will like to advise you that only if she feels  fatigue, if she experience syncope or chest pains and a  heart beat below 40 she should seek medical attention.So, don't worry for the moment because every think is quite normal and what we desire in her situation.Hope I was helpful.

I carefully read your question and i totally understand your concern.It  is very difficult to give an opinion just by this short story. But I will try to explain you something.It is quite known in cardiology that stent ri-stenosis might happen. This risk is higher during the first 6 month and than decreases. But there are  other possibilities after a stent re-stenosis like angioplasty whith balloon , stent-intra stent implantation that mean that you might implant a stent into the obstructed stent, always depending on the type of your first stent and the characteristic of the stenosis. And the last option when the other are not possible is by-pass surgery that you all ready know. So, yes...if your three arteries have problems and your stents get stenosis you might end to bypass surgery. If this is technically possible or not depends on the characteristics of your coronary arteries and the positions of  stenosis.The risk of bypass surgery depends on your age, your heart function and other organs functions.But you should not worry. You do have possibilities to go quite well. There are a lot of possibilities today with a good chronic medical treatment, angioplasty and by pas surgery. Wish I was helpful.

My heart hasn't carried on like this for a year and a half or so... Not drinking anymore caffeine than usual...","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for using HCM. I carefully read your question and i understand your concern.I will tray to explain you something.You might experience irregular heart beat for different reasons.First of all it is necessary to know what is this irregular heart beat. It might be an extra-systolic beat.this is an electrical impulse that generate from parts of the heart different from normal sinus rhythm, causing a skipped beat that you feel like irregular rhythm.Or it might be a real irregular rhythm, when your heart beats in a chaotic way, what we call atrial fibrillation.You might have this rhythm issues because of different reasons from simple emotional stress to pathology es like anemia, hyperthyroidism ectA hole in your tooth does not cause irregular heart beat. Only if you have done an infection in your tooth that might generate an inflammatory process that might give a little sinus tachycardia, meaning that your heart beats over 100 beats for minute.So, my opinion as a cardiologist is that if you continue feeling this irregular beats you should see what are this making some examinations like blood sample, thyroid hormones, electrocardiogram and of course a holter monitoring to see the rhythm tendency.You already do not drink coffee any more and this is a good think because exacerbates your symptoms.Hope i was helpful.

It is not necessary such an  extreme modality. Let me explain you something.The fact that you have done an angioplasty means that you have ischemic heart disease. It is mandatory for you now to maintain your heart as healthy as possible, lowering her excessive work. This means that the heart must have an adapt frequency and work within normal blood pressure. Restricting your salt intake helps you to maintain low blood pressure values, helping your heart to work within normal conditions.This is why we advise you to avoid salt, but it is not necessary to completely leave it, but just to reduce it as much as posible in food intakesYou should all sow be very careful with your cholesterol, with a healthy rich fiber and low cholesterol diet.Hope I was helpful.

They are two different disorders, which need to be treated properly. Regarding high blood pressure, I recommend to closely monitor her blood pressure different times during the day and refer these values to her GP. She needs to perform a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a chest x ray and some blood lab tests ( complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, blood electrolytes, kidney and liver function tests, fasting glucose, etc.), to exclude other secondary causes of high blood pressure. You need to discuss with her doctor, about the possibility of starting and antihyperstensive therapy (or make changes to her actual therapy, if she is being treated for high blood pressure). From the other hand, you need to consult with a neurosurgeon for her lumbar disc displacement, to consider the possibility of surgery to solve this health problem.

This symptomatology is probably related to acute gastritis , esophagitis or gastro esophageal reflux. Do you have any other symptoms like burping or nausea?I recommend using PPIs (omeprasole, lansoprazole, etc) or an antiacid. If your symptoms are relieved by one of this drugs, it would be very indicative for a gastro esophageal disorder.If the problem persists, your should consult with a gastroenterologist and perform a GI endoscopy to rule in/out the above mentioned disorders. Hope to have been helpful!Best wishes, Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"I took my blood pressure & my numbers were as follows: 114 over 74 & my pulse was 111. I was told that a pulse rate over 90 was bad, it this true and what does this mean. I took my blood pressure after I walked up 1/8 of a mile up a hill. Please explain my numbers.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that your BP pressure values and heart rate are within the normal limits. You should know that it is normal to have a higher heart rate during physical activity and walking. Chatecholamines are released in your blood during these activities and responsible for a tachycardia. A pulse rate over 90 would be suggestive for a cardiac disorder, if it were permanent, and not just an episode. So I recommend you to closely monitor your blood pressure and heart rate different times during the day (in sitting position, after 10 min of total relax). If you have a permanent high heart rate, you should consult with your GP for a complete check up (physical exam, resting ECG, blood lab tests). For the moment, there is nothing to worry about!Hope to have been helpful!Best wishes, Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"hi im cesar fuentes, my problem is that my hearts feels like its pounding and racing and my chest starts to hurt. i always feel like im going to get a heart attack or something.

What is her actual therapy?It seems that her blood pressure and diabetes therapy (if she has one), is not effective and some changes are needed to be done. You should know that there is not a specific treatment for these disorders.I recommend consulting with her GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a chest x ray and some lab blood tests (complete blood count, kidney and liver function tests, thyroid hormone levels, HbA1C, cortisol plasma levels, blood electrolytes, PCR, sedimentation rate,etc.), to exclude other possible secondary causes of uncontrolled high blood pressure and hyperglycemia. Some changes to her hypertensive therapy (a dose increase or adding another drug ) are needed. Besides, you should also consult with her endocrinologist for some changes to her diabetes therapy. She may need to start insulin therapy if necessary. I recommend you to consult her as soon as possible with the above specialists, to avoid possible complications of this situation (a possible brain stroke or coronary artery disease).

You should closely monitor your blood pressure different times during the day (in sitting position after 10 min of total relax) and report these values to your doctor. You should discuss with him, the possibility of starting an antihypertensive therapy ( a diuretic, an ACE inhibitor or ARB class).

Please type your query here... hi!i had unprotected sex with my boyfriend a day after my menstrual period and then after the sex,i pushed the semen out of my vagina,my question is will i get pregnant even though i pushed the semen out after sex?","Doctor":"Hi there, I have understood your concern. I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. First of all do not panic. As you might be aware that in a woman with regular cycles day 10 to 20 of the cycle is the most fertile period of cycle. If you happen to have unprotected sex act in the fertile period, then you stand chance to get pregnant . As you have mentioned that you had unprotected sex act a day after your menses, chances of getting pregnant are almost nil. Secondly,  when you have unprotected sex act with penetrative sex and semen ejaculation inside the vagina, the actively motile sperms immediately enter inside the womb. So pushing out of semen will not help to prevent the pregnancy, when you are in the fertile period of cycle. So please use suitable contraceptive method like condom to prevent the unwanted pregnancy. Please get proper sex counselling done before hand.I hope this answer helps you . Thanks.

I am suffering from male pattern baldness and instead of bald spots I have a receding hairline and general thinning through out my scalp ( not the sides and back )I have been on a treatment of minoxidil 5% , finax 1 mg , adgain hair supplement capsules and qsera hair serum for past 9-10 months. I have been taking once 1mg finax , once application of mintop 5 , one adgain capsules,once qsera application daily as part of the treatment For ease of application of topical meds I have also gone bald twice hoping for better hair regrowth. There has been some but not noticeable improvement. Recently I started suffering from severe hair loss , the moment I touch my hair I have atleast 10 -15 strands on my hand. I decided to give a break to all topical meds and get my hair loss under control thinking that the topical meds may have damaged my hair . I was losing about 500 or more strands per day so even applying these meds was worrysome due to excessive hairfall even on touching my hair grow Within 5 days of stopping the topical meds ( minox ) I developed severe itching and scaling on scalp. On consulting a doc I was told that I have severe dandruff and he prescribed me nizoral , an antifungal oral med and an antifungal serum. After the dandruff treatment for just a week the scaling/itching seems to be in control but hair fall is still about 500 stands per day. So my question is( sorry for the long description)- 1 why the massive hairfall ? is it possible that the hair are severely damaged due To continuous application of these meds 2 I have got thyroid checked so that cannot be the problem 3 I have been without mintop for 18 days . leaving mintop causes hair fall but then I left it because of severe hairfall in the first place so that doesn t seem to be the case. What should I do , continue the treatment irrespective of losing 500 hair or more each day or Use something to prevent this severe hair fall and then continue the topical meds. Also can you suggest me some shampoo. due to such fine hair ;prone to breaking putting additional meds on them for almost a year may have damaged the follicles. I want to continue the minoxidil treatment for atleast 4 more months till my hair grow to their original length ( as I said I had went bald) and I am able to ascertain the benefit of minox after about 1.5 years but this severe hair fall has become a hindrance .

Chronic pancreatitis or any other chronic illness can lead to increased hair shedding- Telogen Effluvium.  This happens because of shift in the hair cycle from growing phase to resting phase.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Hair fall is mostly multifactorial: hereditary/ hormonal imbalance/ poor diet and lifestyle/ weather changes/ dandruff/ usage of poor hair products / stress etc to name a few. In your case, the hormonal imbalance could be one of the reasons, which ideally should be corrected. Also 100-150 hair fall each day is normal, as it is the hair cycle. New hair grow in the same place. I would recommend you start doing PRP (platelet rejuvenation plasma) therapy where the plasma from your blood is injected into your scalp with the help of tiny thin needles.

As far as thinning of hair is concerned it is due to Androgenetic alopecia in males wherein there is decreased hair volume and receding anterior hairline.
