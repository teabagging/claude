I have light bleeding last week and yesterday. Today I went to a different gynae and he injected Proluton and Dexamethasone (2-course). I am very worried if this will anyhow affect my baby. Can you please advise if that was the right procedure to take?","Doctor":"Hi,These medicines are considered to be safe during pregnancy. Proluton (hydoxyprogesterone) is a synthetic form of female hormone that is commonly prescribed to reduce the risk of giving birth too early (preterm birth or giving birth less than 37 weeks of pregnancy). Dexamethasone is a steroid that is commonly given during pregnancy to facilitate the maturity of fetal lungs. It stimulates the production of surfactant in the baby’s lungs and thus reduces the risk of lung problems for babies who are born early, particularly for those born between 29 and 34 weeks of pregnancy. It also prevents colitis and brain hemorrhage in the neonates. There is nothing to worry as these medicines do not cause any harmful effects in the growing unborn baby.Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Asthalin is a combination of a stress hormone and a steroid. While these are powerful medicines, used in an inhaler, very little is applied to the lungs. But since the lungs are where they need to work, this works, but the body doesn't get much drug so the side effects are nearly all local. There can be yeast infection in the mouth from the steroid.

Thursday evening i was awoke from sleep with a pain in my chest and an inability to breathe deeply without pain. The pain subsided after 10-15 minutes. Unfortunately, this morning around 1 a.m. it has return with a vengeance, along with a rapid heart rate and more pain with breathing deeply. I managed to calm myself down after some hours, although it felt like my heart was going to jump out of my chest, and was pumping way too hard, and i had heart palpitations that can be felt by placing a few fingers on my left breast. It did initially feel like i was having a heart attack (although i have never had one so i really wouldnt know what it would feel like). The pain is a sharp type of pain in the left side of my chest just to the right of my left breast, and can also be felt in the same area in my back. The pain happens at the bottom of my breath which makes it difficult to take deep breaths without pain. Although my heart rate has returned to normal, the pain is still there some 13 hours later. Some additional information: I sleep on a bad bed and tend to have back pain here and there. Sometimes i stretch my shoulders and chest out to crack my upper back until a pop can be heard in my chest which relieves stiffness. I feel as this can be somewhat related to the cause of my pain because i have been doing it the past few days as part of a normal routine. When the initial pain in my chest started, i thought that i may just need to crack my back in the same way i described to relieve the pain, but when doing so found that i could not and there was no pop in my chest. I have been researching the subject within the past 12 hours and come to find a condition known as Costochondritis. I read that the this condition affects the areas around the sternum, upper rib cage and cartilage between the two, and can be identified as localized pain the the left side of the chest that can cause difficulty breathing deeply. I read that it can be diagnosed simply by apply pressure to the area where it hurts, and if it does it is most likely Costochondritis and not another more serious condition. Well after hearing that i decided to give myself a little test, and applied pressure (not too hard, but not softly either) on my left breast with the tips of my fingers where i described the pain. I found that it was very sore and hurt very much to do that, and since i ve done it, the pain seems to have increased and now i can sometimes feel the pain at a stand still. It is not excruciating pain but significantly uncomfortable, especially when breathing deeply through the chest. I have since been focusing on breathing deeply through my belly, which doesn t hurt as much as if i were to breath through my chest, but the pain is still there. I do not feel as this is a condition with my heart, but more of a bone type of problem. With the information given what do recommend as a course of action and to provide relief to this area? Does it sound like Costochondritis to you? if so, how common is this condition and how long with the pain last before subsiding? As i said before the first onset lasted for about 15 minutes and went away but this time it has not subsided yet and many hours have past since. Going to the doctor is difficult right now as i do not have any money nor insurance which limits me to going only for a medical emergency. Thank you for your time.","Doctor":"any associated fever, cough or loss of weight or appetite.if none of these can treat like costochondritis. can take acetaminophen tablets and diclofenac gel for local application.pain can continue intermittently for 6-12 months"},{"Patient":"I have been prescribed an antidepresant I am on my 6th day .

I went to a doctor and she treated me for both a bacterial and viral infection while she waited for the test results to come back from the samples she took of the rash. A week later, I developed hives as a result of an allergic reaction to the amoxicilian. I went back to the same doctor and she took me off the anti viral and anti bacterial meds and started me on Ranitidine, Methyiprednisone (4mg) dose pack and Dephenhydramine. The next day I saw a dermatologist where she told me to stop the meds I was just put on and prescribed I take 20 mg Prednisone....2 for five days then 1 for five days, then to continue the Methyipredisone treatment. One week ago I ended up in the ER because my blood pressure was high and my heart beat was irregular. Every time I would try to sleep, I would end up waking up grasping for air. While in the ER, they monitored my blood pressure, did an EKG, took a chest XRAY. It was concluded that I was having an allergic reaction to medication and was told by the ER doctor the original doctor should have never treated my original rash with amoxicilian. So, he pumped me with Benadryl and other meds through an IV until the rash I had over my body started clearing up and my blood pressure dropped back to normal. He prescribed a 5 day treatment of 60 mg. of Prednisone. Yesterday was my last day taking the treatment and I am having several withdrawal symptoms. Headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, heart palpatations, high blood pressure, etc. In reading more about this, I have learned just how serious taking this medication really is. I was never TOLD to taper off the 60 mg. per day as I have been reading on line. Is my health at stake here for abruptly stopping the dosage after that short period of time? Or, do I need to give it time for it to get out of my system? I do have an appointment with MY primary care physician and an allergist in a month. However, I don t know how much longer I can go feeling this way. All I know is I don t want to ever have to take Prednisone again if I don t have to. Any advice you can offer would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time, Cindy H.","Doctor":"Hi, I suggest drug induced urticaria (hives) most likely. You may need steroids.

Since you have been taking Bystolic for 1 year and half, these are not side effects from taking this medication. All the above symptoms might be due to discontinuing Bystolic and experiencing the withdrawal syndrome . I assume you were taking Bystolic, a beta blocker medication, for being diagnosed with HTN (hypertension). This medication works by lowering your heart rate and automatically your blood pressure.

Anxiety2. Shortness of breath3. Chest tightness4. Nervousness, headaches5. Dizziness6. Malaise, nausea, loss of appetite7. Insomnia etc If you were my patient :1. I would measure your BP and if it's above 140/90 i will start you on another antihypertensive medication, such Enalapril or Losartan ( ACE-Inhibitors/ARBs ) based on guidelines for your age (2.I will get a CBC, UA ( urine analysis)  BUN/Crea ( check for kidney function) and measure the levels of your electrolytes Na, K, CL, HCO3.3. Have a baseline EKG and /or Cardiac Echo to check the heart structure and function.I would advise you to go back to your doctor and do the above testings.

I rolled my ankle nearly two weeks ago and have been getting around either hobbling or using crutches (which is quite difficult as I have 3 small children). The doctor I saw told me to take Nurofen Plus. I initially took 4 a day and dropped to 2 after a week or so but I was on then for 10 days. It is Sunday morning in Australia, so it is 4 days since I stopped the pills, and a small rash which I initially thought was a mozzie bite started 3 days ago (Friday night). On Saturday morning, I broke out in a hot, itchy, lumpy rash. We have Polaramine in the house so I tooke one and the heat, itch and welts calmed down, but you can still see the blotches. Each time the Polaramine wears off it starts again, but I am getting about 12hrs of relief from the Polaramine. I have not had anything like this before and I usually don t take painkillers for too long but it was really sore and still is... Is this rash from stopping the Nurofen Plus? It is the only thing that I have done differently apart from changing a sweetner from a sachet to the tablet form and I have stopped that now until this is gone. I am not allergic to any foods, textiles or any medication that I know of.","Doctor":"Hi,Your symptoms suggest likely allergy to the pain killer you have used. Hypersensitivity reactions can some times occur in a delayed manner.

I would like to say first that i had an abortion and after three weeks, i had unprotected sex with my husband - actually, the condom broke - before getting my first period. As well, i am on rifampicin and other tablets for TB. After i took the first postinor tablet, i saw that there might be a problem - although i do not know what problem the combination postinor+rifampicin can cause. Anyways, I took the first tablet of postinor after 12 hours from having intercourse but i missed the second tablet, which i took after 24 hours. I panicked, and i bought 2 other postinor pills. I took the first pill from the second box one hour after i took the second pill from the first box. the second pill from the second bok i took after 12 hours - all these happened within 48 hours from the intercourse. Thus, i would like to know what is the probability of being preganant. as well, i would like to mention that i do not know whether i was ovulating or not as i did not get my period back after the abortion. As well, can you recommend me some contraceptive methods with the exception of condoms - my husband does not like them - and pills. I used to take regular contraceptive pills, but the TB treatment mixed up my period quite badly - i started to have periods once in two weeks. Please advise and thank you very much.","Doctor":"Hi,Postinor is a hormonal pill used as an emergency contraception. If taken under 24 hours of unprotected sex then it is 95% potent. If it is taken under 25-48 hours of unprotected sex then it is said to be 85% effective.Rifampicin is an antibiotic used in TB treatment. This drug affects the enzymes required to metabolise hormonal pills and reduce their efficacy which can lead to contraceptive failure. Hence, you are not fully protected.

Very tired, pale stools, dark rings? It sounds to me like a systemic illness that requires complete workup with at a Complete Blood Count and Basic Metabolic Panel. These will let us know if he has an infection, if his blood is healthy and strong and sufficient, if there are any electrolytes and or nutrients out of balance, and or if particular organs and or tissues in the body are ill. Based on his symptoms, and age, I must admit there are a variety of potential causes; Viruses and infections such as Mono or the Flu typically can cause gastrointestinal and generalized effects such as those you describe. Nonetheless, as it can indeed just be a virus, even more benign than the Flu or Mono, it can also be a completely different entity entirely, and thus a formal test really needs to be done to hone in on exactly what that is.My suggestion is to make sure your son hydrates often and as soon as possible schedule a visit with a primary care physician. I would not rush him to the Emergency room unless a primary care physician could not be reached in an adequate period of time, or if your son starts to appear toxic and or the symptoms you are describing start to worsen. I truly hope for the best and believe you and your son will come out of this strong and well cared for.Warm Regards."},{"Patient":"I have migraine. I am 36 years old.

I have under gone t3 t4 and tsh test and report is normal.All of this problem is for 8 years now. I shall be thankful to you if you could guide me.","Doctor":"There are a few possibilities as to what can be causing the symptoms you describe. I'll delve into a few possibilities. Keep in mind however, stress and inherent cardiac conditions can in and of themselves be the root cause for these symptoms, though there are also a slew of outside factors (i.e food insensitivity and reactions) which can cause this as well. Spicy food, as well as salty food have the potential of dehydrating an individual if not accompanied by proper fluid intake. Low potassium, and or dehydration are both known causes of palpation. Food allergies, and insensitivity are also known causes of induced palpations, as well as causing a variety of other symptoms, such as some of those you discussed (restlessness, perspiration). Then there are chemical and emotional reactions to spicy foods which in and of itself can cause palpations. To summarize; spicy and or heavy foods induce very particular brain signals and changes in blood pressure and flow to the GI system. Alterations in GI blood-flow can induce palpations, as the heart is experiencing a sudden change in its normal patterns of volume, flow and pressure. Ultimately, a palpation in and of itself can be innocent and with isolated symptoms oftentimes no need for concern. However with the additional symptoms you describe, your case sounds somewhat more serious, and they are obviously causing you great discomfort. Therefore despite the possibilities for different rationale for your symptoms that I've discussed with you, I highly recommend you make an appointment with a cardiologist to discuss exactly the symptoms you are experiencing, with potential consultation from a GI physician for food insensitivity and or reactivity. As bridge therapy I recommend ensuring adequate hydration, and possibly tums or over the counter ant-acids; to diminish the effects of potential heartburn; as acid reflux can be a known cause of waking + rising discomfort, food associated discomfort and even activity based discomfort. If these symptoms do not improve, and regardless of improvement, have yourself checked out, the best course of action is always ease your mind of possibilities, and have a definitive answer, which formal physician checkups can likely provide. :)I wish you the best."},{"Patient":"Dear All, I m taking Qlaira now for 3 months but I recently read that I can t take them if I have over 90 kg.

Waiting for my doc's office to open this am?  Take Aleve lots of it..doesn't help much and ice packs on painful area.  numbs pain a little..what is being missed?","Doctor":"Based on your symptoms and lab results it does sound musculoskeletal. Costocondritis (irritation and inflammation of the chest musculature),  and or muscle spasms can be extremely uncomfortable and cause similar symptoms to what you are describing. Interestingly with spasms you may also have periods of what is called \\"Flacidity\\" the opposite of spasms it is when the muscle relaxes after a contraction. The bulge you are describing may be that skin and tissue relaxing and thus seeming to bulge. The good news is these are usually temporary issues. If it is muscular, seek anti-inflammatory medications such as Ibuprofen, Motrin and or Naproxen, and I suggest you do some stretches of the upper extremities when you can. If this pain persists there are more chronic and or long term medications that can be used to treat your symptoms, such as stronger anti-inflammatory medications, muscle relaxants, nerve-modulators such as Gabapentin and potentially even narcotics. You have a lot of options, but based upon this short term consultation, there are not many factors which lead me to believe your concerns necessary emergent (life threatening) but they are certainly concerning and uncomfortable. I suggest you seek a thorough workup from a potentially new physician who has a different perspective, and who can hear your entire case.

Many of the early stents, some 20-30 years prior were of a bare-metal casing and as a result, they would absolutely be a contraindication for any MRI scanning.

Nevertheless many if not most Cardiac stents are devoid of any metal products. As there are dozens of different types of stents I will not surmise as to what type your father could have had placed.

If you start taking the pill within 5 days after your period starts, you will be protected from pregnancy straight away.

Therefore you need to take an alternate method of birth control like a condom during your first week on the pill if you wish to have sex. The pill should be taken on regular basis at the same time of the day.

HE IS VERY SCARED OF THE RECOVERY AND OF DIEING.WHAT DO YOU THINK HIS CHANCES ARE OF SURVIVAL?","Doctor":"There are many factors one must address here, but I think it is safe to say that if the physicians cite 50/50 chance for survival WITH surgery, than those may very well be his chances. Nonetheless, I think it fair to say that without surgery; 90% arterial occlusion (depending one which arteries are involved - there are many arteries and their location around the heart and effect in blockage varies); can indeed lead to even worse outcomes if not repaired. Unfortunately, if the physicians are describing Triple Bipass surgery as opposed to a less invasive option (catheterization), than according to medical treatment guidelines, it is very likely these are very important arteries, which must have adequate blood-flow for survival. Thus surgery may be the only option to prevent the inevitable (a full fledged blockage and heart attack which may lead to death). I would assume, and certainly speak to the physicians about this to assess it's validity, that his chances for survival in the near future may be improved with surgery, though for an individual of your grandfather's demographic, there are great risks to surgery as well. You must weigh your options. 90% occlusion of one's triple vessels will not reverse without intervention, and are not conductive with a positive outlook for continued lifespan.

However, if fever does not subside even after taking it, then meftal-p can be given (after the meals) alternatively along with crocin.

Antibiotic induced diarrhea occurs due to alteration of normal gut flora (good intestinal bacteria) which usually subsides once you stop taking your antibiotic.

Other possible situations (like chronic anemia, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance) may trigger this symptomatology.

You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues. Meanwhile, I would recommend increasing salt intake and take plenty of fluids to stay well hydrated. A close monitoring of blood pressure values during the day is needed.

THEY ARE GIVING HEAVY DOSES OF ANTIPYRETICS. WILL THERE BE ANY SERIOUS SIDE EFFECT OF SUCH A HEAVY DOSE OF MEDICINES","Doctor":"Hi, The treatment of Typhoid fever requires use of intravenous antibiotics like Azithromycin and/or Monocef in high doses, until the Widal test titres start to drop down and/or the blood culture show negative test results. In addition, the symptoms of the patient like fever spikes are taken into consideration to determine the duration of antibiotic course. It is not uncommon to change the antibiotic in non-responding patients. This is due the fact that, most micro-organisms have developed resistance to various antibiotics including typhoid causing bacteria particularly in the endemic zones. The duration of treatment depends on variety of factors like bacterial load, sensitivity to antibiotics, patient condition and underlying co-morbidity(if any). Average patient, with no underlying health issues and on appropriate antibiotics recover fully in about 6-8 weeks. The heavy dose of antibiotics is crucial to control the infection and to prevent complications in typhoid patients like intestinal perforations, peritonitis, ulcers in the intestine and neurological complications with spread to brain.

I took metformin for 4 years until they took me off, and have been taking yaz for 3 years. Are my symptoms from not taking metformin?","Doctor":"Hello,the answer is probably no but I'll tell you more in the next paragraph. Yaz may rarely cause such symptoms though. You should discuss this issue with your doctor and perhaps also with an endocrinologist. Sweating and weight gain are general symptoms occurring in a multitude of disorders but an increase in body hair is almost always due to either a side effect of a medication or a hormonal disorder. Let me get back to metformin now. I suppose you're female - because you're worried about the hair - although you haven't mentioned your sex. Women with PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) may have problems with increased hair (with male pattern of distribution) due to increased insulin levels causing increased androgen levels. Metformin may reduce insulin levels and -consequently- androgen levels and may help with hirsutism (increased hair). Stopping metformin may make the hormonal disorder recur and increase the hair. I hope I've answered your question. Please let me know if you need further assistance.Kind Regards,Dr Panagiotis Zografakis,Internal Medicine Specialist"},{"Patient":"hi, i am about to turn 18 and i am thinking about taking a medium strength pro-hormone called kronic by alpha male formulations.

Please advise.","Doctor":"Hi,Antibiotics do not weaken the resistance to infection but alter the gut flora. Human gut contains various microbes (flora) that are beneficial for human health as well as harmful, especially when they multiply. Normally there is a balance between these two.Broad spectrum antibiotics in addition to killing the invading bacteria causing the infection also suppress the beneficial ('good') microbes and thus there is overgrowth of harmful microbes such as clostridium difficile which causes abdominal cramps and severe diarrhea.It is found that most of the gut microbes return to normal after four weeks after stopping the antibiotic.

I would have a physical exam performed by OBGYN and or Primary Care Physician, explaining to them your symptoms and how the lump has come and changed in size and or consistency. From there they can pin point to you the likely diagnosis. I will also say that slightly painful is more often than not a good sign, if you are worried about cancerous potentialities.

Detoxification is the process of allowing the body to rid itself of a drug. It's often accompanied by withdrawal, which is the set of symptoms the body experiences when long-term use of a drug is abruptly discontinued. The unpleasant symptoms (anxiety, insomnia etc.) can arise throughout the period of withdrawal. It can also impart a high risk of relapse for people undergoing detoxification. Hence, Self-detox is not recommended.Ativan's potential for extreme withdrawal symptoms, and the risk of relapse, detoxification should be closely monitored by medical professionals. Detoxing under close medical supervision can ensure that you have quick access to medical care if you experience rebound anxiety during the withdrawal process. This can help you make it through detoxification without going back on the drug.4-10 weeks is standard for a detoxification schedule, during which your doctor will likely choose to decrease your dose by a set amount each week. Some time flumazenil is used to counter symptoms of Ativan withdrawal. Taking methadone and Ativan is not recommended unless there is a medical indication and prescribed by your doctor. You need to consult your doctor for an alternative approach.Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Admit I do get winded more noticeably than previous years, not sure when may have started, speculating could have been developing over 10 or 20 years, probably genetic given my conscientious health management throughout life, etc. Initial cardiologist recommended coming back in 6 months for another ecocardiogram, as currently asymptomatic , and risk of surgery greater than current condition, even upon my questioning advisability of doing sooner than later. Obtained second opinion, cardiologist and surgeon I spoke with recommended surgery sooner rather than later, given want to avoid waiting for direct symptoms or damage to heart, etc. They said given my current general condition, my risk at lowest end of 1-3% for experiencing problems from valve replacement surgery, should recover fairly quickly. As far as conventional surgery concerned, they mentioned two current options, artificial valve and organic valve (cow or pig). Tradeoff with artificial is can last indefinitely, though they recommend taking take blood thinners such as coumadin or warfarin , which I m aware of the extensive side effects, especially over time, etc. The organic value apparently does not necessitate any such issue or treatment, though the expected duration of these animal valves are only 10 to 15 years, after which another replacement may be needed, etc. I did ask about a non-invasive valve replacement surgery I ve heard about, which this location is one of a limited number of providers doing so over the last year or two (University of Kansas Medical Center). The cardiologist & surgeon I spoke with said the “non-invasive” valve surgery is currently only approved in the US for very high-risk cases at this time, who are not likely to survive conventional surgery, though the process may be more available in the next 5 to 10 years, assuming current rate of progress. Question – Are there any other less destructive “blood thinners” available aside from “Coumadin” if I go with the artificial valve?? I’ve heard there may be at least two others available. If there are no options from this substance, I may go with the organic valve option. Are you aware of any effective organic blood thinning alternatives without the chemical drug side effects?? I have taken garlic and cayenne supplements for many years, among others, which I am further researching. Any comments or suggestions on other sources or advice would be appreciated… Thanks, Jim YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"hiyes Dabigatran is a more safer blood thinner available these days.Dabigatran (Pradaxa) is an anticoagulant medication that can be taken by mouth. It is being studied for various uses and in some cases is an alternative to warfarin, since it does not have to be monitored by blood tests, but offers similar results in terms of efficacy.Use of Warfarin requiress constant monitoring of PT/INR,WHILE Its not required with  debigatran.In case of major bleeding, there is an antidote, idarucizumab,available.It appears to be as effective as warfarin , and  much safer."},{"Patient":"hello im taking kingtropin for the last 30 day and i notice that i have headheaches and wrisk pain. is there a mayor side effect? im 44 yrs old athletic and this is the first time im taking this or any other product. im injecting 2 units daily. what is the risk of taking it?","Doctor":"Hi, Yes, headache and wrist pain are important side effects of kingtropin.

I have had various tests done that showed no direct problems with my heart that require attention.I am currently taking Propanolol 60 mg and Fludrocortisone 0.1 with little to no relief of my symptoms.Is this just a coincidence or is there a connection to food poisoning?","Doctor":"Hello, Khalia.  It sounds to me like the food poisoning caused severe and rapid fluid loss from vomiting and/or diarrhea, which led to the \\"neurocardiogenic syncope.\\"  The feelings you describe--rapid heartbeat, worse with walking (or other exertion); lightheadedness; hot flashes--are typical of what people experience just prior to passing out.  These are also called \\"pre-syncopal\\" symptoms.  You mention the Holter Monitor had showed a abnormally fast heart beat (tachycardia).  How fast was it?  Did the heart rate slow down when you started taking Propranolol?The \\"Neurocardiogenic Syncope Syndrome\\" should not continue after the lone episode of food poisoning.  Once the acute illness is over, and once you re-hydrate yourself, things usually go back to normal.  People with true \\"Neurocardiogenic Syncope Syndrom\\" have abnormally sensitive autonomic nervous systems, which overreact to the normal signals to vasoconstrict or vasodilate the arteries, or to slow down or speed up the heart rate in response to certain stimuli.  If your blood pressure is usually abnormally low (which many normal, healthy 18-year-old women have), then if you are menstruating or dehydrated for any other reasons, your blood pressure could drop low enough to feel uncomfortable symptoms or to pass out.  This is one reason a doctor might try Fludrocortisone, a type of steroid hormone made in our adrenal glands that causes the blood pressure to rise by increasing the absorption of salt and water by the kidneys.  The other thing we sometimes try for this problem is to promote a salty diet, either by eating salty things, adding table salt, or sometimes prescribing salt tablets.  This helps the body's salt and water balance to promote thirst and water retention, which, in turn, helps fix dehydration and helps to keep the blood pressure higher than it naturally is.Depending upon what happens to your symptoms with aggressive hydration and possibly increased salt intake, your heart rate may decrease on its own, and you may not need to stay on the Propranolol permanently.  Definitely follow up with your doctor to monitor you for your ongoing symptoms and look for other possible causes of sinus tachycardia, an abnormally fast pulse, such as anemia, hyperthyroidism, ongoing infections, etc.Good luck, and let us know what happens."},{"Patient":"Hi- I ve been taking detox pills off and on for several months now.

But, I would recommend consulting with your attending physician for a physical exam and some tests to exclude other possible causes of chest pain and uncontrolled blood pressure: - a chest X ray study- a resting ECG- complete blood count for anemia- kidney and liver function tests- thyroid hormone levels for possible dysfunction- blood electrolytes for possible imbalance- fasting glucose- blood lipid profile for dyslipidemia.  A cardiac stress test is needed to exclude possible coronary artery disease. Meanwhile, I would recommend some tips to help maintain a normal blood pressure: - avoid salt and caffeine intake- perform a lot of physical activity (aerobics, walking). - try to lose some pounds if you are overweight. Stress seems to play an important role in your symptoms. Yoga and meditation may help in this regard.

Gynecomastia occurs due to an imbalance between the sex hormones testosterone and estrogen. Estrogen causes breast tissue to grow. Letrozole acts by decreasing the formation of estrogen from testosterone and thus it is used to treat gynecomastia. Since letrozole does not reduce the levels of testosterone so it is less likely to affect the sex drive. You may take this treatment under the supervision of a cosmetic surgeon.Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Cough has reduced I understand that it is steroid and it should not be stopped immediately and it should be tapered. Please advice","Doctor":"Hi,It is not safe to stop using omnacortil abruptly if it is used for a long period of time. Omnacortil is a steroid (prednisone) commonly prescribed to treat various inflammatory diseases such as bronchial asthma or allergic bronchitis. Sudden stoppage of omnacortil can produce 'acute adrenal crisis' or withdrawal symptoms such as severe fatigue, weakness, and joint pains. This happens if omnacortil is used for a long period of time. Since your wife has used omnacotril only for one week such withdrawal symptoms are unlikely to occur if omnacortil is stopped abruptly. So, it can be stopped as per her doctor's advice.Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

If you stop taking venlafaxine suddenly, it can cause 'discontinuation syndrome' characterized by anxiety, vertigo, dystonias (abnormal movements like torticollis), tremors, fatigue and irritability. Hence, it is not safe to do so.If you wish to switch over to mirtazapine from venlafaxine I would like to suggest the gradual reduction of dose of venlafaxine as follows:One day before actually starting mirtazapine, reduce dose of venlafaxine to 75 mgOn day-1, further reduce the dose of venlafaxine from 75 mg to 37.5 mg and simultaneously start taking mirtazapine in a dose of 15 mg/dayContinue reducing the dose of venlafaxine by 50% every day and taking Mirtazapine 15 mg every dayThen on day-8, stop taking venlafaxine and continue taking mirtazapine only in a dose of 30 mg/day.Hope I have answered your question.

Anyway, your blood pressure values are above the normal ranges and you should consult with your attending physician and perform some tests (chest X ray study, resting ECG, complete blood count, kidney and liver function tests, fasting glucose, etc.) to exclude possible causes of high blood pressure.  You may need to start antihypertensive drugs. But, high blood pressure does not explain your tingling sensation in the left arm. Are your symptoms (tingling over the left arm) modulated by arm position changes? This would be indicative of a nerve pain. In such case there is nothing to worry about. A nerve conduction study would help determine possible nerve compression. Meanwhile, regarding your high blood pressure, I would would recommend some tips to help you have a better control on your blood pressure: - reduce salt and caffeine intake- perform a lot of physical activity (aerobics, walking, etc.)- try to lose some pounds if you are overweight.

Based on the history, you seem to have developed the symptoms due to the sudden discontinuation of the anti-depressant medication, citalopram. If you stop taking citalopram suddenly, it can cause 'discontinuation syndrome' characterized by anxiety, vertigo, dystonias (torticollis), tremors, fatigue and irritability.

Shall I keep taking the medicine or I should stop it.","Doctor":"Hi,Yes, it can be due to the side effects of Isotretinoin. Isotretinoin can cause arthralgia, back pain, and myalgia as some of its common side effects.

People who start at higher doses or taper off the medication too quickly are more likely to have a relapse. More than half of the people with polymyalgia rheumatica have at least one relapse when tapering off the corticosteroids. Relapses (flares) are treated by increasing your drug dosage for a while then tapering again.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
