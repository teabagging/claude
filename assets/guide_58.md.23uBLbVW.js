I am Dr Shareef answering your query.All the precautions including birth control pills are not 100% fool proof in protection against a pregnancy if you are sexually active. If I were your doctor, I would go for a serum HCG determination to rule this out as urine PT test might not be always positive. An ultrasound of the pelvic organs might aid in the diagnosis. This would also rule out any other intra-abdominal pathology. In addition, I would also advise you for a urine routine/microscopic/culture sensitivity test to rule out a silent UTI, and a gynecology assessment to rule out a PID (pelvic inflammatory disease). Till then, I would advise you for an anti spasmodic drug with a proton pump inhibitor drug for a symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

These have not worked and on occasion she is coughing up white thick mucus . Her breathing is getting more and more restrictive. No fever or sweating present. I am getting concerned as this is not showing even the most remote signs of improving. We are thinking of taking her to the children s hospital for an X-ray .","Doctor":"Hi Welcome to heathcare Magic! At times the asthma gets exacerbated due to seasonal change or exposure to the factors that cause the bronchospasm. Different asthmatic persons have different triggers for precipiting an attack. Please keep the child away from dust smoke and open environment where pollens are in plenty. An intercurrent viral infection can also lead to increase in the problem. The idea of takin her to hospital is a timely and wise decision, she will get relief with nebulisations of bronchodilators and if required  antibiotics can be instituted. Wish you a great health!"},{"Patient":"I have night sweats and am coughing through the night. I have currently had many facial breakouts of little systs that hurt and contain clear fluid .

I don t know if this is allergy related or if it seems a bit hormonal since I recenly have been having alot of breakage in my hair","Doctor":"Your problem seems to be of allergy. You should take a short course of steroids. Take a tablet of  montair lc also. For the eyes you may use cromal eye drops and flixonase nasal spray for the nasal discharge. If allergies are very troublesome you may go in for allergy testing and desensitization. Pl consult a dermatologist for the cysts on the face."},{"Patient":"My son (19) has been experienceing morning nausea for about 6 months. He complains about extra mucus on his throat which can cause vomiting . Drs have recommended trying over the counter allergy medicine. Claritan Reditabs helped somewhat but do not take the symptoms away completely. Should he try the behind the counter version of Claritan?","Doctor":"HI Extra mucus in the throat/ post nasal drip is one of the symptoms of rhinitis or sinusitis (though sinusitis also associated with pain over the cheeks and by the frontal sinus at the forehead, redness of nose ,cheeks or eyelids). There are other causes of postnasal drip but they are not as common, they include: as result of medication, deviated nasal septum. Treatment of allergic causes of postnasal drip includes: (1)avoiding exposure to the allergen if possible, in some cases where the symptoms are severe and unresponsive to treatment then allergy testing may be considered to identify the specific allergen (2) the use of nasal sprays-  your son may want to try using a nasal spray such as nasonex, flonase, beconase (3) you can use the over the counter claritan to help with the symptoms (4) you can also try a mucus thinning medication such as mucinex (5) if there is any nasal congestion, a decongestant can be added If your son uses these allergic remedies and still does not have a response, then you should consider revisiting your doctor I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hello I am almost 18 years old and I think I may have COPD because I feel short of breath.

Back then all my friends parents pretty much smoked. Ive had this for a long time. I do not feel fatigued or had any chest pains. I went over there everyday after school. Stayed for a few hours and left. Will I die? I m rather worried.","Doctor":"Hi COPD/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has 2 main forms: emphysema or chronic bronchitis.Emphysema occurs when there is enlargement of air spaces due to destruction of the walls of some of the air passages in the lung. Chronic bronchitis is diagnosed if the person has a productive cough for at least 3 months in each 2 consecutive years with all other causes having been excluded. (You would need to have a mucus producing cough for 3 mths out of each of the last 2 yrs). Symptoms may include productive cough, breathlessness and wheezing.. It is diagnosed based on history of smoke exposure and symptoms, physical examination. Blood test and imaging studies will need to be done if it is suspected by your doctor.COPD is not normally seen in young persons There are other causes of shortness of breath and your doctor will check for these. They include: anemia, asthama, lung infections, heart disease, inflammation of the lung, blockage of the upper airway such as the nose. You need to see you doctor to determine the cause of your symptoms I hope this information is helpful to you"},{"Patient":"I feel like I've been punched in the stomach, right below the sternum.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.From your history, it seems that you have got some kind of inflammatory pathology in your abdomen. If I were your doctor, after a clinical assessment, I would go for an ultrasound of your abdomen with special reference to the biliary tract and pancreas, a routine blood test of CBC, blood sugar, an LFT, a serum lipase and amylase. Till the reports of these tests are ready, I would advise you for an anti spasmodic drug, and a proton pump inhibitor for a symptomatic relief. In case the pain increases in severity, I would advise you to report at the ER of your nearest hospital for proper management.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Since you have taken chicken, the bone piece may have scratched the wall of food pipe. The pain in right shoulder might be a referred pain. Sometimes when throat hurts it would cause spasm and it will make difficult to swallow. Since you havnt given any symptoms of fever, cough etc it is easier to rule out sore throat. The constant pain may be due to some bone particle still sticking to the esophagus or some injury due to it. It is better to get a endoscopy to identify it.

I went to doctors yesterday and was given an inhaler and antibiotics but wasnt told what i actually had wrong with me or how often to take the inhaler.","Doctor":"You are having lingering effects of a respiratory tract infection which is causing your symptoms. Shortness of breath is because airways become hyper sensitive after a bout of infection and go into spasm with littelest provocation.

If the itching comes down, it might be due to an allergy . If it does not get better, please visit a dermatologist for diagnosis and treatment.

More specific allergy tests can be done to identify exactly what your sister is reacting to. Allergy tested can be done by skin testing or blood tests can be done to check for the response to a variety of allergens. In skin testing a small amount of the allergen is placed on or below the skin to see if a reaction develops. The blood tests checks for the presence of certain antibodies in the blood .Antibodies are found if your body has responded to a substance, in this case an allergen. It also checks the intensity of the response. Allergy tests can check for problems with foods, dust, animals, grasses just to name only a few. Your sister should speak to her doctor about where she can have the test done, once the specific allergen is identified then she can determine whether it can be avoided.

Thanks, Ashish","Doctor":"The cough is occuring again and again because her asthma is not adequately controlled. She can be given a short course of steroids along with inhalers like seretide or seroflo or foracort. Once breathlessness and cough are controlled, oral steroids should be tapered off and inhaler medicines continued as these have hardly any side effects. She can continue deriphyllin and montair lc. Before all this, have a chest x ray taken to rule out any other pathology."},{"Patient":"my 7 yr old daughter has had a cough for over a week with no ther symptoms except runny nose . The doctor checked her out and said she was fine except the usual allergy stuff. she has no fever but now shes been feeling dizzy, has a bad headache , and eyes hurt all within several hours. this has to be more than allergies, correct? but no panic because no fever, correct? what could be going on? take her back to doctor? blood work? thank you in advance!!!","Doctor":"Your daughter is suffering from allergy and that may be cause of all her symptoms. She could even be having sinusitis which may be causing headache. You may give her montair lc kid and tyelenol to tackle her symptoms. If possible, make her do some steam inhalation."},{"Patient":"Hi Dr. Samuel. I am Michael. I have been experiencing itchy nasal especially when I am asleep during the night. Due to this I often sneezes the whole night depriving me of sleep. When I start sneezing my nose gets blocked and sometimes clear mucous runs from my nose. Could this be a case of sinus or are they parasites in my nasal? Please help. Thank you.","Doctor":"You could be suffering from allery or it could be even sinusitis. As you sleep, secretions accumulate in your nasal cavity and irritate the nasal mucosa which causes you to sneeze. Take a monteleukast tablet, a loratadine tablet and flixonase or duonase nasal spray-one squirt each nostril twice a day. This should help."},{"Patient":"Hi....i get sneezing bout, runny nose water type discharge from nose especially during monsoons also i have itching on my legs leading to tiny boils Also...i had once done check up and was told maybe due to a high esinophil count and i have noticed it usually hapens when i eat fatty foods quite regularly (fried, butter, cheese, non veg, etc)","Doctor":"You are suffering from allergic rhinitis and all symptoms appear to be due to that. High eosinophils are also due to allergy and not vice versa.Take an antihistaminic like cetrizine once or twice a day, montair10 once a day and use flixonase nasal spray twice a day. Deworm your self with zental400, one tablet at night for 3 days.  You should improve with these.

It helps me for around 48 hrs and after that i need to take one more tablet. Can you advise wheather i should continue that tablet so regularly. I feel very tired and kind of sleepy after taking a tablet.","Doctor":"Telekast l is generally given in patients known to have allergies. It\`s a good drug with little side effects and can be taken for long periods. The feeling of tiredness and sleepyness is because of the L content which is levocetrzin. You may try taking plain telekast to avoid these side effects."},{"Patient":"yes sir I do have abdominal problem longtime ago I do feel too much bleeching abdomen babling heavy sholder  windy back pain feeling fatigue headach when I bend left side or twist ifeel pain under chest abdomen bloating I feel burning under the feet and hands I feel light headed Ifeel whole body burning sometime when I eat I feel food stack in my throat I feel pain on chest both side my arms dead I feel fever I did almost all checkup and many medication especialy anti acid pls advise wha to do","Doctor":"Hi ! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.After going though your history, if I were your doctor, I would advise you for the following:1) Try to remove your anxiety on this issue or any other one.2) Elevate the head end of the bed with two blocks on each side, so that the regurgitation does not occur while lying down, and the contents of esophagus and stomach flow down with gravity.3) Some modification in your diet like more of roughage, enough liquids, avoidance of oily, fried, and fast food, and avoidance of alcoholic beverages and smoking if you do.4) Regular routine exercises like morning walk depending on your medical fitness.5) Prescription for a prokinetic agent and a proton pump inhibitor for symptomatic relief and to have a control on the acid production and facilitate movement of gastric contents downwards.6) Routine stool test for ova and cyst and treat them if positive.7) If the problem continues, then you might have to consult a gastro enterologist for a possible endoscopic evaluation of your intestines, and also an ultrasound to rule out any intra abdominal pathology.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery.

That\`s the reason your white blood cell count has fallen. A person with low WBC is prone to develop many superadded infections and the rash may be a result of that.

There are many causes of having allergy and you have to find out the allergen observing one by one by avoiding that thing. These factors are, Dust,weather,food like certain cereals,vegetables like bengan,tomato,cold drinks Cosmetics like soap,duo spray,perfumes,some clothes,synthetics etc. By trial and error you identify the allergen.

It initially reacted the way that is normal for me, large raised bump with pretty immeditate itching. I was bit 3 times in 3 areas in a few minutes- left knee , inside upper right knee and upper outer right thigh. The one on the inside of my right knee created a large red area and it also seemed to swell my leg in that area and is a little tender when pushed on. It still itches pretty bad (the other 2 bites haven t itched since shortly after getting bit. the actual bite has turned a purple color. Never had this reaction to a horsefly bite before. Do I need to be concerned or give it some more time? It s been approx. 56 hours since being bit.","Doctor":"Hi there, Thanks for writing in. As of now, I feel you might want to give a trial with over the counter oral anti histamines like piriton  and apply some hydrocortisone cream at the site of the bite where it itches. Horse fly bites do take a while to heal. In the presence of other symptoms like fever, wheezing , gradually progressive swelling of the leg, pus formation, with pain increasing in intensity, I would say visit your doctor immediately. If this is the case you might require antibiotics. Hope this helps.

Tickling sensation in the throat could be either due to allergies or GERD(gastro esophageal reflux disease).It could be due to allergies since you just recently moved into a new house. You could try cetirizine for 3 days. Have warm water at regular intervals. One teaspoon of honey might be soothing. Use a mask while dusting the house ;as dust might be the cause of allergy. Avoid smoking /exposure to smoke Hope this helps. Regards, Dr. Divya Kuttikrishnan"},{"Patient":"I am having an allergic reaction on parts of my face.

You have to avoid the cosmetic creams or other cosmetics which may cause allergy on your face.   Wash your mouth three or four times in a day with water. Don't use excessive cold or hot water. Itching may be at least partially controlled with the use of low-sedating antihistamines . You can use alovera, it will reduce the burning sensation of your face.  Protect your face from direct sun light and dust. Avoid traumatizing the skin by keeping fingernails short and hands clean to avoid scratching and infecting the skin.

A week later, i noticed a lump on my neck right below my earlobe. Is it lymph node reacting to the stink? If so, how long does it take for it to go down. My earlobe is slight swollen. Toni","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to HCM, Lymph nodes act as a barrier. Lymph collected from any tissue have to pass through a lymph node before mixing back in blood. Whenever there is a infection/inflammation in the catchment area of a lymph node, infected lymph will reach to lymph node and lymph node will becomes swollen as a reaction. When your ear lobe will become normal, lymph node may gradually shrink to normal. Thanks for trusting Healthcaremagic and posting your query.

Are there any good natural or Ayurveda cure? Thanks Prasad","Doctor":"Hello mr. Prasad The rashes are usually taken as allergic manifestation. In ayurveda the usual treatment for such condition is taken on two flanks, first is blood purifiers and other is immuno boosters. Many a times this allergy can be from intrinsic reasons also.

Plus I did not have it hooked up correctly so the air was blowing inside the room. Could this be the cause?","Doctor":"You could be suffering from cough variant asthma and trigger could be as you have said the stale water in your portable ac. There must be moulds and spores of these moulds may have triggered the attack. You should take inhalers like asthalin, seroflo. montair tablet and if required, a short course of oral steroids.

I am 26 years old and recently, not constantly, but often break out in the sweats. I have ran a low grade fever for a few days and of course my mind automatically goes to cancer with those symptoms. However, I do have allergies and a possible sinus infection right now And a lot of stress/ anxiety as I am starting a new job and just moved. Thoughts?","Doctor":"Welcome to Healthcaremagic You have been diagnosed with Sinusitis (inflammation of the sinuses). All of these symptoms can be easy attributed to sinusitis. Sinusitis at times can be difficult to treat at times. Although your worry is genuine in the sense that a malignancy can have the symptoms of low grade fever and sweating however it should also have other symptoms such as weight loss, decrease in appetite and excessive fatigue etc. Still one should not go to that extent since there has been a diagnosis that is easily explaining your symptoms. If on the other hand there was no obvious cause for these symptoms only then one should think of investigating your symptoms on the lines for a malignancy. So it would be best at present to stay calm and follow your treating doctor's advice and ultimately get better. Getting anxious at this place in time would only disturb your life (both professional and social) and that of others (your loved ones) and would also not serve any purpose.

Do i have to change the medicine ? as i heard montair fx will help in my case but not sure . Please advice","Doctor":"Hi, . Stickiness of eyes is not a common unless the conjunctiva is inflamed. Allergic conditions can induce such inflammation resulting in the production of sticky secretions. You would need to address eye issue independently apart from allergic rhinitis. Washing the eye with luke warm saline water should take care of the sticky discharges.  However a permanent cure can only be found by allergy desensitization process. Desensitization process takes a long time and result is not consistent. You can consult an allergist nearby to help you through with the desensitization technique. In the meantime, consult an ophthalmologist to rule out other causes. You may use montair along with your current nasal spray after discussing with your treating doctor. Hope this answers your query.

Your husband must have had an open prostate surgery (not a transurethral one) which could result in a hernia in the incision site. This could result due to very many factors, like a week musculature, or a post operative infection, due to chronic cough/constipation resulting in increased intra abdominal pressure or due to dehiscence of the suture line due to inability of the suture to hold both side of the incision in place. This would need an elective surgery which would close the defect and strengthen the musculature with a synthetic mesh. This could also be done by a laparoscopic method in competent hands and results are usually good.

Because of frequent side effects (commonly stomach upsets, palpitations, headaches etc.) and interaction with other drugs, this is not the first choice for treatment of mild asthma. For mild asthma, first choice treatment is use of salbutamol inhaler whenever required. 2) Montelukast is a controller medicine which is to be taken regularly to prevent asthma attacks. It reduces inflammation of aiways, which is the cause for asthma.

Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, I would advise you for a urine routine,microscopic and culture sensitivity test to rule out a UTI.

In case of a female patient,  would also think of a gynaecologist consultation to rule out a PID. Further management would depend on the clinical findings and reports of the investigations noted.

To begin with, an opthalmologist is not the right person for puffiness under the eyes.

If after the consult, you get an all-clear regds pool water or other allergens, then you may want to consider if the child is getting enough sleep or needs to see a child counsellor or child psychologist..you would be surprised how often this will help.

At the onset, it is important to note that allergic rhinitis when remains untreated for long eventually leads to asthma-like complications and full blown asthma. There is a lot of research to support this concept and hence treatment of both rhinitis and asthma may be required depending on the stage of presentation. You need your son to be seen by an Allergist for either skin prick tests to elucidate the actual allergenic triggers or blood tests (specific IgE) where the same can be identified. A strict avoidance together with optimal treatment for both rhinitis and asthma is then required.

I m not sure what to make of this but it feels like my lungs are going to explode when I cough/sneeze???","Doctor":"Hi, Let me address your concern one by one. 1. I hope you have completed the course of second antibiotic, which you are not allergic to. 2. If you have completed the course, then make sure that you are not taking any other medications. Since, medications usually cause heavy breathing, shortness of breath, it is better to avoid any medicines as such unless they are required. 3. I do not know your age, I am sorry. However, it is advisable to get an EKG done to look for the cardiac status. 4. Repeat a chest X-ray now and look for signs of residual congestion on the lung fields. 5. It is better to consult a pulmonologist and get bronchodilators prescribed (IF required only). Hope this helps. Get well soon.

It was after one day my heart started racing out of nowhere and assumed I was having a heart attack . I was diagnosed with anxiety after the results came back. I have asthma , allergies, and almost every symptom possible that comes with generalized anxiety. Lately, my chest has felt heavy, I have been having issues with this summer and using my inhaler a ton. I always assume the worst ever since the anxiety attacks . I just saw my doctor for a routine check up, but either my anxiety has been awful lately or something is going on. What should I do?","Doctor":"Dear freind, welcome to HCM. anxiety can precipitate asthma attacks as well as allergy. too much inhaler containing bronchodilators can also set the heart rate racing as well as bronchospasm. It is difficult sitting here to tell what predominates. pl. get help of your doc ar a pulmonologist and optimise treatment . give upo being anxious, avoid precipitants . do not overuse inhaler than advised. keep busy with some work/ hobby to beat anxiety let me be posted on the progress.

Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. If I were your doctor, I would go for a urine PT test, a serum HCG test to rule out a pregnancy. If all are negative, I would get an ultrasound abdomen to rule out any intra pelvic pathology, and advise you for a gynae consultation for ruling out a PID (pelvic inflammatory disease). Till then, you could go for an anti spasmodic drug along with a proton pump inhibitor drug for a symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

These symptoms have been fairly mild, so I haven t taken any medication. But today I ve been having shortness of breath for no apparent reason, and the allergy level in my city is quite high today. So I m wondering if shortness of breath can be linked to allergies. If so, what s the best course of action from here?","Doctor":"you symptoms sound like SAR or seasonal allergic rhinitis and allergic bronchitis. in thiscase, please get tested for allergies esp if any pollens. use of nasal sprays and inhalers during the allergic season will keep your problem under control"},{"Patient":"I am 20 years old and aside from having asthma I m a heathly person, but randomly the leftside of my chest will feel like someone is just squeezing my chest sometimes it take my breath away other times I can get ride of the pain by simplely taking deep breathes. I ve never been known to have any kind of heart problems or any big problems.","Doctor":"Hello, It is possible that your asthma is getting worse and allergic triggers need to be excluded. You need to check with your Chest Physician on your asthma control. Occasionally such chest pains can be due to anxiety and taking slow deep breaths is recommended. If you have a family history of heart disease, a fasting cholesterol check will be worthwhile."},{"Patient":"Hello. I have what I believe to be a wheat allergy rash on my hands and arms. I have antihystamine tabs and cream for it, but wondered how long before it starts recovering. I first noticed it about 5 days ago but paid it little heed until it got worse. I started treating it today 6 july. Is there anything else I should be doing to aid recovery? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello, True wheat allergy is rare, whereas wheat intolerance is quite common. Allergic rash secondary to wheat allergy is unusual, and this might be a coincidence. You are more likley to have idiopathic urticaria that might get worse after eating certain foods and long-acting antihistamines for 4-6 weeks is recommended. If you continue to have itchy rashes, continue for 3 months. Fexofenadine 180mg/90mg and/or cetirizine 10mg is standard treatment options. I hope that was useful."},{"Patient":"I have had a problem with my eyelids and the area above them swelling for the past few years. I assume thisight be an allergy symptom. It doesn t happen all the time. Recently I ve connected it to staying in hotels with the air conditioner running. Is it perhaps a reaction to mold in the AC unit? Might it also be the bedding or chemicals used to clean the bedding? It only occurs when I lie down in the bed. If I am up late, the swelling does not happen.","Doctor":"Hello, Mould allergy aggarvated by AC units is a good possibility but hotel rooms are notorious to harbour dust mites and dust allergy would be likely. Skin tests to moulds, dusts, cockroach need to be done to exclude these allergies. If you are using any eye maskara or facial cleaning products, you need to get a patch test in order to exclude a delayed chemical hypersensitivity. Skin prick tests and patch tests are different, so you need to see an Allergist or a Dermatologist to sort this out."},{"Patient":"Hello doctors, i am a 28-year-old lady. suffering from less phlegm , but continous one for the past one and half months and now for the past 2 weeks i have been suffering from sneezing , when it comes it was continous. Because of the strain, i am passing few urine also. I am using asthalin rotacaps for the last six months more... so advice me what i have to do....","Doctor":"Hello. You are being treated with bronchodilators indicating that your doctor has probably diagnosed you as suffering from a reactive/ allergic bronchitis. Salbutamol (asthalin) is just a reliever (like crocin for a fever) and does not alleviate the root cause. I suggest you to take a rotacap with fluticasone + formoterol combination. For your sneezes, a nasal spray of fluticasone + azelastine will help but try cetrizine initially. You need to rule out infection and if found, take antibiotics. Any cough for more than 3 weeks is a warning symptom and a X-ray chest is advisable as also is hemogram with eosinophil count. Now regarding urine incontinence. Don't worry. It is quite common phenomena in ladies. A pelvic diaphragm normally supports the urinary bladder and helps it to hold urine even if intra-abdominal pressure rises (such as in coughing). After delivery of a child (and also in elderly ladies), this diaphragm becomes loose. Hence the urine dribbling occurs during a cough bout. The treatment is simple. Do pelvic diaphragm exercises. These are similar to Moolbandha of yoga. You have to constrict the muscles around the genitals, pull the genitals up and release after 10 seconds. Do this 20 times a day and in a week or two, the muscle should be strong enough. Also, the cough also would probably stop by then. -Dr. Tushar"},{"Patient":"I have a reactive airway from a virus for the past 3 weeks. Had spirometry done (normal) and clear chest X-ray . No fever, clear mucus / post Neal drip....causes gagging, coughing, laryngeal spasms. Taking xopenex to open airway (works well) and on last to days of Medrol pack. Only problem is the xopenex makes me very jittery, extreme fatigue,headache, increased HR until it starts wearing off after about 3-4 hours. At about 5 hours I can feel my airways starting to constrict...I try to get to 6 hours so I can avoid the side effects. I have been using the inhaler every 6 hours for the past couple of weeks. Questions 1. Is it ok to keep usIng like this until the virus is gone....repeated side effects? 2. Can one become dependent.....therefore needing every 6 hours or is it because there is still illness and the inhaler simply wore off? 3. Is an antihistamine like Zytec ok to take to try to dry up the PND?","Doctor":"Hello. Interesting question. You seem to be well read. However there seems to be some communication gap. You said that the airways constrict. You mean airways in chest or the nasal passages? I suspect that you mean that your nostrils get blocked (because your spirometry is normal). Nostrils normally get congested (swollen) and they do get blocked. However they do not constrict because there no smooth muscles in the nasal passages! Normally, a virus infection does not last for 3 weeks. So this is post viral reactive airway causing airway (here I mean chest airways) constriction and post nasal drip. If the drip/ phlegm turns yellow, suspect a superadded bacterial infection and take antibiotics. You have already been put on steroids (medrol). I suggest that you start inhaled fluticasone + formoterol combination for 3 weeks or so (if you mean the chest airways) OR start a Fluticasone + azelastine nasal spray (if you mean nasal airways constriction). A non sedating antihistaminic, such as levocetrizine with montelukast will help. There is no addiction potential to any of these medicines. However nasal decongestants do cause rebound congestion. So avoid them. -Dr. Tushar"},{"Patient":"Hi, Febe, Im 12 years old, you see my skin asthma , started last year, i drank a lot of medicine prescribed by my doctor and nothing happened, i still scratch , my skin asthma is really bad, from my neck down to my body, i tried different lotions, and after a while it makes me scratch again, pls pls help me, i dont wanna have this forever, my legs they re really ugly right now, so please help me.","Doctor":"You should ask your GP about prescribing some antihistamine medication such as Phenergan (promethazine hydrochloride) , this could alleviate some of the symptoms although i cant see the skin itself so i cannot provide a definite treatment plan.

As you have taken Homoeopathy in past there may be 2 things, 1) As psoriasis is being known for its recurrence, it may have come back but this time in less intensity and in less area of your body. 2) your homoeopath needs to rework on your case, make fresh case taking and see how things unfold.

Suggest you get either blood tests (specific IgE) against fungal allergens/mould mix or see an Allergist for skin prick testing against moulds and fungal allergens. Deepending on where you live, it will be important to get the right mix of moulds and fungal allergens tested.

It started from her left side of neck and creeped towards head, behind her left ear. She was in acute pain for four hours at night and each time she tried to move her neck towards left, she experianced a vertigo like feeling. It was warm in that place and I tried to put some water (even if she had chest congestion). After few hours it was reduced to normal. We found she had this experiance way back in 2009-10 when she was prescribed synasma 400 for 7 days. We didn t realised that time that it is due the drug and had to admit her to a hospital, because we thought it was a symptom of cerebral irregularity. But obviusly nothing was diagnosed.

If she is not in an attack, I would advise either trying to call her doctor at home and see if she can take the clenil strength available where you are staying OR take her to a doctor or urgent near where you are staying now to get a prescription for the appropriate dose of her medication.  The dosages on pediatric medications are usually based on weight and age of the patient. Be well, Dr. Kimberly"},{"Patient":"my son has high risk asthma and is havin regular attacks in the night.

My daughter is 9.5 years old. From 2009 january she started wheezing . Before that she s very normal. After consulting a paediatrition dr. advised her to start sereflo 200. 2-0-2. Flomist nasal spray , lasma 5mg. After regular treatment they reduced the drug and now she s using forocart 200 1-0-1. Before starting the treatment they advised to take x-ray. Report is enlarged adenoids . But dr. told that is not a problem. But she had attack again two days back. I am very much confused. I am scared that whether she should take inhaler life long? Please tell me whether adenoid and wheeze have connection. Tell me the remedy.","Doctor":"Adenoids are nothing but lymphoid tissue in the back part of nose. They are more active in children and defend against infections traveling in air breathed in through nostrils. In the process, they become swollen. Your daughter is suffering from allergy. It is most likely related to dust, pollen etc. The child is suffering from allergy i.e. bronchial asthma. Enlargement of adenoids is also due to allergy and occasional infection. Adenoid enlargement will not influence bronchial asthma in any way. Your child's bronchial asthma will usually reduce in frequency and intensity as she grows older. Though she may not be absolutely free from asthma, she will surely have less and less of it. Prevention of exposure allergy causing agents like dust, pollen, dry weather, some foods like eggs or fish (if applicable) and undue strain, eating very cold foods etc should be avoided to prevent attacks of asthma."},{"Patient":"My mother was under treatment for asthma and diabetics from 17th April.

It is due to histamine release from mast cells that can be triggered by infections or sometimes idiopathic. The condition resolves on its own and antihistamines help in lessening the symptoms. Do NOT scratch as physical urticaria is one entity that worsens on scratching. Full blood count (to exclude infections), liver function & thyroid function check is sometimes helpful. Long-acting non-sedating antihistamines over 6 weeks to 3 months (if 6 weeks is not enough) such as Allegra (Fexofenadine) 180mg/90mg and/or cetirizine 10mg at night is recommended."},{"Patient":"Hi, im 17 and since feburay ive been having alot of stomach problems its always hurting and uncoftrtable everythime i eat it gets worse.

If you are needing to use the abuterol >3 times a day then you need to be on streoid inhalers and use this only when required. Combination inhalers (steroids + long-acting beta agonists) are to be used only when the steroid inhaler on its own is insufficient to control your asthma. The ther good combination is a steroid inhaler plus montelukast which will require lesser use of abuterol. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor I am burning and itching all over my body, I feel like something is biting me But I don t have any bumps or rashes , I don t have the shingles nor do I have bed bugs.

I quit for 1 year in 2008 relapsed very shortly after yr to date when i relapsed in 2009 using same bong method with juice. last year in march i went to rehab but left in july due to a relapse, my daily intake is rather excessive i can often smoke up to an eight ball (3.5 grams) a day, i started to occassionally use heroin in september of this year I am not physically addicted to it, but i do use it more than i should. around christmas of this year i noticed i was becomming very short of breath and having troubles breathing wheezing very badly. on christmas i suffered my first asthma attack my respiratory health has steadily declined unfortunalty my meth bong usage has not. i have just recently stopped smoking heroin(i was using bongs for that also) and i can only take about one puff of a cigarette without choking literally and coughing till i usually cough up blood.

If the baby inside the uterus has any stress, it may pass motion into the amniotic fluid, if aspirated can cause problems. To manage them the child has been correctly admitted in the ICU. As you know heart has left and right sides: Right side receives venous blood from various parts of the body ( which is less in oxygen ) and pumps it to the lungs for oxygenation. From the lungs it will return to the left side, to be circulated to other parts of the body . Now when the lungs have problems, like aspirated meconium, oxygenation may not be normal. So the heart has to over work, and become 'tired' in the process. The function of the right heart, pumping venous blood into the lungs comes down. resulting in fluid accumulation. This for easy understanding they have told as swollen heart. If the basic condition is treated then heart function will become normal. Several children have been born like this throughout the world. Generally they recover. We must thank the ICU people managing small babies. They work very hard and are very passionate about their work, and they love children. with regards"},{"Patient":"My mother has injections for her asthma .

How long would it take to get healed completely","Doctor":"Hi Morgan, I can understand that the spray has caused an allergic reaction in and around your eyes. Since it has not come down with the creams for a week ,I think you are still in contact with the irritant. 1. Change all your pillow covers and the bedding sheets. 2. Try cold water compresses for about 5-7 mins twice a day. 3.Continue your topical creams as suggested and a dose of oral antihistamines [for 2-3 days] should help you relieve  itching. 4. Review with your ophthalmologist who can wash your eyes thoroughly by syringing and remove any remnants deep inside your eyes. He can also guide you whether your swelling is due to allergy or any other cause. I hope this helps and have a speedy recovery :).

Please suggest me what to do as am afraid of my health.:((","Doctor":"Dear Abinaya, I am not sure what type of cough you are having - if 'neither dry nor prolonged' - then I have to assume it is 'wet' meaning infected. Chest XRay, blood cultures (if you are having temperature spikes) or a review by a Pulmonologist is recommended (CT Chest and/or bronchoscopy). As for the gastric problem, if you are on ranitidine or pantoprazole for at least 3-4 weeks and no improvement then reflux disease causing cough is unlikely. Is there a temporal pattern to the cough or worsened on lying down (which indicates reflux disease). Drug-induced dry cough are commonly due to blood pressure lowering medications such as enalapril, captopril, lisinopril etc that can be stopped if cough is very bothersome but consult with your Cardiologist, who will also ensure that the heart is not the cause.

She has never had food allergies or sensitivities. Could peanut butter cause such severe stomach pain.","Doctor":"Dear sir/madam, I am really concerned that your child is suffering from stomach pain. If she has taken peanut butter previously without any stomach pain before, then it is unlikely to be the cause. Allergies don't appear all of a sudden at this age without symptoms in childhood. There are many causes for stomach pain which needs to be evaluated in detail by a physician. At this age gynaecological causes like pain prior to menstruation, pain prior to ovulation predominate. Also renal causes like renal stones, urinary infection needs to be ruled out. An ultrasound can be done after consultation with your physician which can pick up major problems of abdomen. Don't worry she will be alright. Just get her evaluated by a good physician. Take care.

I am a young looking, petite 54 yrs of age and post menopausal. The itch can be brought on by bathing (not exclusively) mostly on legs. One itch can trigger a full blown attack from head to toe including the scalp, eyes, nose, face, especially the ears inside and out. Talking or thinking about it can cause flare-ups. When a right extremity itches, the left may itch in the same place. When an attack is really bad, my heart races and it seems as though the itchiness is could be running through my blood and the itch will come from the inside out to the skin. Rubbing the skin w/without lotions or creams or both, unscented, etc. helps and is very time consuming. I also have a raised blue vein that runs across my left forearm above the elbow that severely itches from time to time. What in this world is going on and how can I treat and cure it without man made drugs?","Doctor":"As discussed earlier, itchy skin can be the result of fluctuating hormones during menopause. As estrogen leaves your body during menopause, it will stop the production of collagen, a youth hormone that keeps us looking young. Therefore when the production of collagen stops, itchy skin begins. Estrogen also is responsible for maintaining moisture, so dehydration can occur as a reduction in estrogen production occurs, which can cause extreme itchiness. Unfortunately, itchy skin can become extremely disruptive and the more one itches, the more one scratches. During menopause, many women find itchy skin to be more of an annoyance than a debilitating symptom, but there are many treatment options. It is advised to see your healthcare provider immediately if your menopausal itching is extremely severe, affects your entire body, has lasted for over a week and doesn’t improve with lifestyle adjustments and/or is accompanied by weight loss, changes in bowel habits, fever or redness. it might be allergic problem too. byeeeeee"},{"Patient":"Sir, i have to take anti histamine tabs every third day . i get eruptions with violent itching only in the evenings. the itching comes down after 30 minutes but cant sleep as the place of itching keeps changing. what to do ? can i go for Allergy profile done by a pathologist 24 hours after intake of anti histamine ?

Thanks for your question. From your question it is evident that you have lower respiratory tract infection but is it associated with asthma or not that should be understood if you please mention your symptoms like respiratory distress,wheez etc but it can be a bronchial asthma and be sure if you are not a smoker that doesnot mean you dont have any chance of bronchial asthma.

Recurrence is common. It is a self limiting disease and will heal spontaneously within two weeks. So don't worry.

You have already said that it's cured. Regarding Asthma, it is not a curable disease, though, it is a preventable disease, that is, its progression can be halted on a regular treatment.

Blood work shows platlets at 145 and then 24hrs. later at 138 and his bilirubin was 1.6 the first time and 2.3 24 hrs. later. He has asthma and IBS but otherwise is healthy and very active. The lymph node was causing pain and that is what brought us into his doctor in the first place. What could be causing this?","Doctor":"There can be many causes for the swollen lymph node. First and foremost it could be simply because of repeated sore throats if he suffers from them. Even a infection in the scalp or a boil  in the area can cause this. However what is important is that more important causes like tb and many others  should not be missed out. For this you should consult your family physician and he will examine the child and if he finds it clinically significant he may advice a FNAC  or a excision biopsy of the gland. Regarding his raised bilirubin, he may be suffering from jaundice-early stage. Some times many a people have raised bilirubin without any other symptoms. Put him through full liver function tests and a USG of abdomen and consult a general physician or gastroenterologist."},{"Patient":"I have been having bad pain in 2 or 3 spots of my head.

I will try my best to provide you with best possible professional recommendations to your questions. Allergic asthma is the most common type of asthma. The most important thing in allergic asthma is to find out the cause and avoid or to sensitize to it. Allergens, which are small enough to be inhaled deep into the lungs, include windblown pollen from trees, grasses, and weeds mold spores and mold fragment animal dander and saliva dust mite feces, cockroach feces. An important part of controlling your allergic asthma is to limit your exposure to allergens. Determining the allergens to which you've become sensitized, and then taking steps to minimize your exposure to them, is likely to improve your allergic asthma control. Regarding medications you are already taking them. I advice try to find out the cause and avoid them, like try using face mask while going out, avoid the pollen and if you have pets avoid them for few days. Yet again, I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query. Regards"},{"Patient":"hi doc. my daughter is 3 yr old last night she started with 100.6 fever and vommited(3.30 am) what she ate in the night.even yesdterday she banged her forehead to the wall she cried for sometime but then she was fine and active . fever was before she got hurt (10pm),nxt morning i took her to doc he gave dolo 250mg(every 4 hrs 4ml)and as she is allergic and sneezing hicef(2 times 3.5ml).now can the widal or viral fever come down oly with paracetamol .plz advice .he asked me to review if the fever persists for 3 or more days.","Doctor":"Hello madam, I am sorry that your daughter is suffering from fever. Fever wiith sneezing probably suggest that child is suffering from viral upper respiratory infection. Normal course for viral fever is it subsides on its own in three to four days. All that is required is fever medications to keep her comfortable, antihistaminics for sneezing and plenty of fluids to keep her hydrated. As long as child is active, taking small quantity of food you can wait for three days as your doctor mentioned.

But you mention the pain depends on the quantity you consume! Allergic reaction to foods do not (usually) depend on amount as little amount trigger reactins in a short time. If blood test (specific IgE) to fishes are negative, you will need a skin prick test to the particular fish as skin tests are more sensitive. If skin tests to all fishes you have reacted to are negative, you may have a condition called histamine intolerance which is sometimes related to the amount of food ingested (usually foods high in histamine such as eggs, chicken, tuna, chocolate etc). Occasionally a bad reaction (with stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting and feeling ill for several days) to fish is due to scombroid toxin poisoning i.e., due to eating expired canned fish or semicooked fish. No specific treatment is required but antihistamines help. If the stomach pain is due to several unrelated foods, check with a gastroenterologist to exclude ulcer disease."},{"Patient":"For the last week I m itching like crazy in my knee pits, on the bony parts of my hips, and my upper butt cheeks. There is no rash or bites. Best I can figure is some kind of allergy , but why only in those spots? It started around the time I ate raddiccio. I m not allergic to anything else from the lettuce family, so that would be strange to be allergic, but possible I guess.","Doctor":"Hello, Cruciferous (lettuce) vegetables such as cauliflower, raddichio can have high levels of salicylate that can explain the itchy hives that you are having. However, this is usually a secondary trigger for people with 'idiopathic' urticaria (medical term for red, itchy hives that can feel swollen under the skin) and is occasionally generalised (i.e., whole body may be involved in hives). I would not suggest going on a strict low salicylate diet as it is a very difficult diet but you might want to stop raddichio in your diet and start taking either cetirizine 10mg (max twice daily) or Allergra 180mg for the next 2-3 weeks until all the hives have cleared up. Sometimes the treatment needs to be continued for 3 months so check with your doctor on the right antihistamines. If you do not high levels of salicylate sensitivity (i.e., can tolerate other foods high in salicylates) then do NOT go on a strict low salicylate diet. Sometimes in people with salicylate sensitivity, one may be able to tolerate some foods but not others in the 'high salicylate' list which may be the same with you."},{"Patient":"Hi I have been suffering from a cough for about a week during the day i have the odd coughing fit but at night time when I lay down I am being kept awake by constant coughing fits and i have this feeling in my chest that feel like I have inhaled water It feel like my lungs are flooded.

Can you reccomend any relief for this as I am exhausted from not sleeping.","Doctor":"You could be suffering from allergic cough or cough variant asthma-a type of asthma. Take a Montair LC, a bronchodilater in the form of inhaler like Aerocort 2 puffs 2 to 3 times a day and a protone pump inhibiter like Pantoprazole once a day.

You should take a course of antibiotics  like Amoxycillin, antiallergic like Allegra, a pain killer for bodyache, fever and headache. Pamper yourself with hot soups, ginger tea and drink enough water. Take plenty of rest and adequate sleep. Vigorous physical exercise should be avoided when body is not upto it. However you can go for short walk when not running fever to get some fresh air."},{"Patient":"My 8 year old grandson has excema and allergies to milk and eggs . He scratches all the time and especially if he gets upset about somthing. He scratches sometimes until he bleeds . He had anafalaxic shock when he was almost 3. We thought maybe he would grow out of it, but not true yet. ABout a month ago he had a virus and was throwing up. Now he thinks that if he eats he will get sick again, so he is eating very little and the things he does eat, he questions his mom or me how we fixed it and are we sure no eggs or milk is in it. He is so worried about what he eats that I am afraid he is going to develop an ulcer or make himself sick. Any suggestions on how to get him over this.","Doctor":"Dear JCoates, You have to make sure your son stops the cycle of itch, scratch and bleeds. Eczema is still probably not under control and will not be helped if he has allergies to (say) house dust mite, cockroaches etc. Food allergies worsening eczema is smetimes the case and the evidence is more for eggs and milk apparently making eczema worse. I hope he had a skin test to prove the food allergies in the past. If yes, he needs to be retested for aero-allergens such as dust mite, pollens etc that may be worsening control of eczema. Egg allergy rarely persists into adulthood and if you ensure his eczema is controlled and tested for other allergies, he may eventually outgrow his egg allergy. He needs extensive counseling regarding the eczema, how and what he can do to control it (such as avoiding soaps for washing which dries the skn and leads to itching, that he scratches and bleeds); moderate strength steroid creams, lots of moisturisers, even tacrolimus cream for face and neck that his Allergist or Dermatologist can prescribe. Once the eczema is under very good control, skin tests will help determine what is going on. I hope that was useful."},{"Patient":"Hi, I got my arms and legs waxed and the next day I had an allergy on my arms. I am not to sure if this allergy is due to the waxing or cuz of the woolen jacket which I wore on d same day....? Any recommendations I am allergic to betnovate ointment..... Is it alrite to use tenovate-m","Doctor":"Hello Khangura, It is most likely secondary to procedure and you must ensure you get a patch test to exclude chemical sensitivities. I presume the 'allergy' was also on the legs. If you had a similar reaction to waxing before, then it is even more important to exclude the chemical sensitivities before you go through another waxing procedure. Allergies to steroid creams are possible and this can also be checked when you have the patch test. For the time being, antihistamine tablets such as cetirizine 10mg twice daily or allegra 180mg once daily with Calamine lotion on arms and legs should be enough to control the reaction. I hope this was useful."},{"Patient":"My 18 month old son have problem of cough regularly and for that we visits several times to doctors.

As with all steroid usage, growth retardation is a recognised side effect but much lower than oral steroids as inhaled steroids are generally used to control airway inflammation along with montelukast. Skin prick testing is recommended to ensure common household allergens like cats and dog dander are not making the asthma worse when avoidance will be key. House dust mite allergy is also important to know as changing bedding or adding a layer of protection with dust-proof covers for mattress, pillows, duvets are important. Important to get rid of old soft toys as they accumulate dust very quickly. I hope that was useful."},{"Patient":"My son (21months) has had alot of coughs and colds for the past year.

I am also trying to take neem daily so as to cure it naturally too.. looking forwad to your reply. Many thanks in advance","Doctor":"Dear Arti, Your question is not very clear when you mention 'skin allergy' over 20-25 years. If what you are referring is itchy red weals all over the body with or without swelling of lips/tongue for so many years, it is quite a common condition called urticaria. If there no obvious triggers, like commonly used pain killers (ibuprofen, codeine-based analgesics) or allergy to pollens etc then the condition is idiopathic (meaning all known causes excluded) and responds to long-term high-dose non-sedating antihistamines. Occasionally thyroid or hormone abnormalities or stress can prolong the symptoms, but infection triggers are also common. So infections need to treated and high-dose antihistamines must be used at the same time. Your doctor has rightly given you a short course of steroids which is sometimes the last option. Cetirizine 10mg twice daily or allegra 180mg (morning) and 90mg (at night) plus or minus atarax 25-50mg at night are the usual treatment options. Must be used for 3 months at least without any attacks. Also rarely, patch skin tests are done to exclude chemical triggers. I hope this will be useful."},{"Patient":"My eosnophlia count is 10, other test results of CBC, diabetes and thyroid are OK.

YYYY@YYYY 0000 Bangalore","Doctor":"Hello, Reading your query and the results of the blood tests, I presume that the percentage of eosinophil count is 10% that has several causes. The commonest cause in tropical countries is parasite infections, and antiparasitic treatment is recommended after stool culture studies. This is a must before going through unnecessary tests or treatments. If the eosinophil count remains high and sneezing and rhinoconjuncitivitis symptoms persist, it would sugest allergies as the underlying cause. Pollen allergy, smoke (industrial) are major factors that needs high dose antihistamines and steroid nasal sprays. The duration of treatment will depend on the trigger (i.e., seasonal vs perennial [all year around]). There are several other causes but infections, allergies and rarely autoimmune diseases are causes of raised eosinophil counts.

Also he has always had very loose and smelly stools and i have read that this could be signs of cystic fibrious? many thanks.","Doctor":"Hi, A 7-month old baby boy with recurrent chest infections and possible non-resolving gastroenteritis requires exclusion of an imunodeficiency disorder. I do not know of your family's origin (ie., Caucasian or Asian etc) but this is really of no consequence. Shadow on Chest XRay is usually against asthma and infection-induced asthma is more likely. Sputum or blood culture reports would have been helpful as recurrent bacterial infections would suggest an antibody deficiency. A full blood count (most importantly white cell count) is important and low lymphocyte counts would suggest an immune deficiency disorder. An unresolved infection also requires exclusion. Any child with polyps in the nose has a high likelihod of cystic fibrosis but of course that also needs excluding in your boy (sweat test followed by CFTR genetics). I would strongly suggest asking your doctor to get serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM), specific antibody levels (HiB, tetanus, pneumococcal) and lymphocyte subsets (CD4/8/19/56) are the most important initial investigations to exclude an immune deficiency. Please let me know if I can be of any more help.

Do a skin allergy test to identify the allergens. Use cotton cloths always. Ur beds and pillows should be plastic covered and dust free. Avoid exposure to dust if possible.

The doctors said it is junior asthma but even with the steroid inhaler there is no change and every couple of weeks it returns. his appetite remains (which is very healthy as he us a big boy) in the day he struggles and it is worse at night. I do not think it is asthma and I am worried please help. Regards Richard Smith","Doctor":"Dear Mr Smith, Reading your query it seems that your 15-month-old son is having upper airway problems both during the day and night, but worse at night, and you do not think the steroid inhaler has helped. Nocturnal cough has many causes, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (i.e., hyperacidity) that respond to acid lowering agents (such as Gaviscon (UK), or proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole etc); and then 'junior asthma' that responds to as required salbutamol inhaler (but you need steroid inhalers as rightly prescribed if that happens during the day as well); and of course, allergies that need excluding. Asthma in little children is difficult to diagnose particularly as they are unable to perform lung function testing, so trial of bronchodilators or the leukotriene inhibitor (see below) is the usual management plan. If he has wheeze during the day when he is playing (i.e., exercise-induced asthma), a trial of montelukast can be recommended. If there is history of eczema and family history of allergies, skin testing (or specific IgE blood tests) is important to exclude common household allergens such as house dust mite, cockroach etc and specific treatment (including avoidance strategies) can then recommended. I hope this is useful. Best Wishes."},{"Patient":"Hi im Bri 19 female 168lbs, with no major medical problems ( asthma ) I woke up crying due too severe pain on a scale of 1-10, 10 in my both my lower calves, Idk how to describe the pain I just know I woke up in tears , of also just happens while just resting.

To establish the diagnosis, get a PFT done. A chest Xray and routine blood examination and sputum examination should be done to rule out any other disease. Once diagnosis is confirmed you have to take both salbutamol and long acting corticosteroid+LABA inhaler for long term control.

Your symptoms are definitely tough to handle but I am glad you are concerned about your health and want to do something about it. Stomach toubles, constipation, bloating are all symptoms of a possible allergy. However, when along with skin rashes and fever, the condition definitely needs medical treatment. With regards to diet, it is possible that there can be a gluten intolerance/sensitivity. Gluten is a protien present in cereals/grains processed from wheat which is the major constituent in giving the elasticity in wheat based products. Some people are sensitive towards the gluten and hence the reaction in the form of abdominal pain, crunches etc. A gluten free diet is recommended which is available in most of the medical shops and food outlets. Also, care should be taken not to consume wheat based products. Also, consult a doctor to confirm if it is Gluten sensitivity before you can change your diet.

I understand your concerns about asthma medications becoming addictive. Here are few facts about asthma that might help you. What is asthma? Asthma is a disease of airways resulting from constriction of airways leading to wheezing, coughing and breathing difficulty. Like diabetes, hypertension it is a long term disease. There is always an ongoing inflammation of airways resulting in on and off worsening of asthma attacks. why do we need long term medications? Two types of medications are available. Reliever medications like levolin which cures an attack, preventer medications like Budecort(steroids) which prevent future episodes from occurring. we take medications for diabetes, hypertension for a long period but never complaint about taking them. Since asthma is also a long term disease, preventer medications has to be taken for a long time. But good news for you is a good percentage of children may outgrow asthma as they grow older. I feel worried that my child may get dependent to inhalers ? This misconception creeps in everyones minds when they think of inhalers. For becoming addicts, medicines should reach brain. They should give a pleasurable feeling resulting in craving to have more and more. But such phenomenon doesn't happen with asthma medications. They reach only lungs, act on airways, reduce inflammation and never reach any where else. That is why inhaler medicines don't cause side effects like tremors, palpitation as oral medications do. Inhaler medications are perfectly safe and don't cause addiction. Hope your child outgrows asthma. Till then take preventer medications. Keep in touch with your doctor. They will increase or decrease medication dosages based on your child's response. hence regular follow up is needed. Regarding your child not gaining weight, I need your child's weight and what all she takes for whole day. have a good day."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, my baby boy is going to complete 6 month old on 29th April 2012.

It shows that she was suffering from a respiratory tract infection. Are you sure she is suffering from the same problem this time. It needs to be found out why is she suffering from repeated respiratory tract infections. It can also be an allergic attack and so is repeatedly occurring. I would advise you better go to a Physician who can get a complete check up done and find out the exact cause. Also Leon is an antibiotic so do not use it injudiciously. Use it only on prescription from a doctor. Till then you could try taking steam inhalations and warm water to drink and gargle.

The toe cramps arent painful and go away within 30 seconds. The lower ab and oblique cramps feel like a golfball sized compact tightening of the muscles and can be brought on by simple act such as twisting and turning during normal daily activities. They can last up to a minute or two and leave me writhing around trying to get it to unclentch. I try to drink at least a gallon of water a day due to the vitamins and legal supplements I take. Aside from water and bananas and not overtraining my stomach muscles, what can I do to mitigate these cramps. Thanks for your help","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query and an elucidate history. The cramps and particularly the history of ''golfball sized compact tightening in fact can be a real mass or a cyst or a lipoma inside the muscle mass or a small hernia. I would advise you to get a physical examination done by a General Surgeon and evaluation by a high resolution ultrasonography. IF indicated get operated and you will be dine. The cramps at the toe may be just incidental, do not worry if there ae no other associated symptoms of lower limb weakening or so."},{"Patient":"Our daughter has been suffering skin rashes from the last twenty days.

If the symptoms do not improve you will have to consult a good ENT specialist for the thorough examination of the nose and the paranasal sinuses.

Steroids do have side effects and that\`s why inhaled form of steroids are prescribed which have very minimal side effects as a very small quantity is absorbed in the body. Therefore you must ensure that child takes these inhalers regularly and oral steroids can be avoided as these are given when symptoms worsen and have much more side effects. Instil healty habits in child by following a routine and healthy eating habits and avoiding junk food as much as you can.

I have been following a low FODMAP diet but the burning comes and goes still.","Doctor":"HI, Welcome to HCM. Based on the information provided the cause for the burning tongue is most likely to be due to Vitamin deficiency. Neither Fructose intolerance nor PCOS cause such symptoms. You have never mentioned whether you had any ulcers on tongue. Deficinecy of Riboflavin, Zinc and Vitamin B12 often presents with similar complaints. So, taking multivitamin capsules containing these vitamins and minerals will relieve your problem. Hop you got the solution you were looking for. Wish you a speedy recovery.

First of all, remember 2 cm functional cyst does not need removal at all, most of the times it gets absorbed on its own. The additional symptoms of pain in a abdomen along with diarrhea, nausea, frequent urination all suggest that you may be suffering from a severe for m gastroenteritis and may be an associated Urinary tract infection. I would advise you the following:First of all send the samples for tests before starting any antibiotic so that we can have the best results and reports to help for the most proper treatment. Send urine for culture and sensitivity and routine tests of urine , blood and stool. Get started on a course of an appropriate antibiotic and metronidazole, probiotic.

I am a medical specialist with sub specialty of Csardiology. I assume that hiatal hernia has been diagnosed by a specialist. Most of the symptoms of hiatal hernia are due to acid contents of stomach spilling into your food pipe. Therefore, your heartburn, pain in the middle chest are due to this.  As part of stomach occupies the space where the lungs are therefore feeling of 'hard to breath' occurs.  What can not be explained is Diarrhea, therefore, consult your primary doctor, I am sure he would like to rule out Giardiasis, Amoebiasis and Irritable Bowel Syndrome. I assume asthma is well controlled with inhaler for when you have the episode of 'hard to breathe' , is there whistling sound or wheeze. Meaning thereby perhaps you need more prescription drugs for asthma. Surgery, is curative for Hiatal Hernia, and it is done when patient is feeling bad so that symptoms are taken care of. Asthma will not give much problem to your surgeon and anesthetist though you can remove your apprehension by speaking to them. I assure you that you have taken right decision for surgery, go ahead. Best of Luck.

The correct terminology is Bronchial Asthma. Asthalin or Salsol(Same salt) gives only temporary relief. What you need is inhaled steroids which is the mainstay of treatment of allergic conditions.

You should also take Montair LC 1 tab per day and a Pantocid before breakffast. The fast heart rate may be due to disease itself or due to Asthalin/Salsol. Tiova inhaler will also help.

I have gone through the report of the allergy test yo have posted. Based on the reports your mother seems to be allergic to many substances ( Allergy point of greater than 1.2 is considered Positive) except for Sulpha, tamarind ( 1.2 is usually considered borderline), cockroach dust, pencillin, Tetracyclin, perfume ( less than 1.2 is considered negative). As the allergy test predicts allergy to very few substances, you mother might be allergic to some other substances as well. The Definitive treatment of Allergy is avoidance of allergen. Medicines can only give symptomatic relief. But the hard fact is you mother can be allergic to substances other than those predicted in allergy test and it is difficult to find out. Using preparations like Monteleukast in combination with Levocetrizine is knoen to prevent recurrence. But these are not useful in acute attacks and they need to be taken for longer durations to be effective. Taking medicines like Avil( contains Chlorpheneramine which is drowsy formula) or Allegra( contains Fexofenadine which is non drowsy) or DEC ( Hetrazen - proven to be useful in some cases)would help in treating acute attacks. Taking Low dose steroids is also helpful. But please consult a doctor before taking these medicines. Mean while try to avoid the substances for which the allergy score is above 1.2.

However please remember that if the rash is worsening or he develops symptoms like breathing difficulty, swelling of tongue,high grade fever, vomiting, decreased urine or bleeding from any site then you should seek prompt consultation with his doctor.Since benadryl and I assume local cortisone has not been effective the doctor might precribe hydroxyzine or levocetrizine or prednisone as per his weight and indication. The less likely possibility is that of a viral exanthem but its usually preceded by prodrome illness like cold, fever, stomach upset etc before 3_4 days of rash.Also viral rash usually subside in a couple of days on its own. So you may wait and watch for progression and as per feasibility consult your doctor for confirmation of diagnosis and management. Wishing him a speedy recovery.

The pain in abdomen and then the tingling and spasms of your hands and feet are suggestive that you has an attack of reduced calcium in the body.

Also to get the hormone studies of the parathyroid glands as well as a high resolution ultrasonography of the neck for parathyroid glands.

She is otherwise healthy without any other symptoms but she always keep on breathing from mouth which make me feel miserable. Please help","Doctor":"Hello Fatema , Welcome to Healthcare Magic forum. Your history does seem to resemble that of allergic rhinitis which is common in children especially if there is any family history of allergy or asthma or there is frequent exposure to dust, pets or birds, pollution etc. I assume your pediatrician has ruled out any infection and completed a course of antibiotics to treat if any. Singulair is an appropriate prescription if the cause is confirmed to be allergy.The mouth breathing is definitely due to nasal blockage  and congestion which commonly occurs due to infection or allergy or an ENT problem like tonsils adenoids hypertrophy or deviated nasal septum. A complete Ear nose throat examination, chest auscultation and blood tests like complete blood counts and blood smear and erythrocyte sedimentation rate(esr) can mostly differentiate between them and give an exact diagnosis . So it is advisable to discuss it with your doctor if they can be done and then treatment with singulair can be given if allergy is confirmed.

It appears that you may be having fungal infection in the outer ear fold. This could result from sweat accumulation, seborrheic dermatitis and lack of hygiene. While showering, do clean behind ears as otherwise infection may develop. If you have severe dandruff, you may need similar ointments which you are using for the scalp, folds of nose etc. Keep the area clean. Wipe regularly with clean, soft cloth. Eat balanced diet. Drink 1-2 litres of water daily. Avoid cleaning inside of ear roughly. Avoid using cotton ear buds as they can increase chance of infection. Wishing good health.

Cold environments will make the air dry and your mucus thick,which drips down the throat and tickles it causing a cough reflex. Or it could be due to allergy also.

Dr said to follow up with optometrist for eye problem.","Doctor":"Hi Shrylllanes, If your redness is recurrent in the same eye,it has to be examined under the slit lamp in an eye clinic. Some times sinus congestion will simultaneously affect the eyes producing conjunctival congestion alone which recovers once your sinusitis is relieved. Although sinusitis will cause headache, any refractive error  should also be ruled out. Cold compresses for 5-10 mins ,few times a day ,with an antihistamine vasoconstrictor eye drop  four times a day ,will help you symptomatically until your ophthalmic visit. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi. I am on peritoneal dialysis. I have been foe the past 3 years. My symptoms are uncomfortable stomach bloat that I have had for a few days.

Hi Peritoneal dialysis is being done for such a long time, there is a possibility of peritonitis.As per your history the other causes can be :Intestinal infection as you are more prone to.Increased urea and creatinine also can cause changes in the intestinal movements, predispose to infection. I would suggest you the following:First of all get the stool tested for routine, microscopy and culture and sensitivity. Secondly get started on appropriate antibiotics as per your kidney function reports under the guidance of a Nephrologist.Get other blood tests to see for CBC, Kidney, liver function test.X-ray of the abdomen in standing position.The proper diagnosis can lead to a proper treatment and you will be fine."},{"Patient":"Hello, My father has been an asthma patient for a long time and gets an attack almost every morning, stays for a couple of hours and gets better eventually, for a few days now he is starting to get the attack many time during the day, he was prescribed Omnacortil in but that did not make any improvement to his health, we plan to start the treatment as fresh soon, need your suggestions on what to keep in mind and expect and any off hand suggestions to not let the situation get worse, would be appretiated .

He is being treated by Dr. mannan in Paras and doctor has put him on seroflo (after giving him antibiotics such as augmentine, azithral, allegra , ascoril, ambrolite and nebulisation thru budecort and asthali). He says it is allergic cough. His throat swab is normal. Adenoids are bit enlarged but they not blocking the airways. I saw Dr R K Mani and Dr. K Chugh – While Mani says it is wheezy bronchitis , Chugh says it is asthma . My son has never wheezed, he is never breathless. Only problem has been frequent cold and cough. I was going through the internet – it says seroflo is given to asthma patients and those with quite severe conditions. I am really worried because steroids of this high potensity can cause side effects. These are taken by mostly adults. Please advise.","Doctor":"Seroflo is a combination of fluticasone and salmeterol.You might feel like he has not has had wheezing, but when the doctor auscultated his chest , he may have heard some rhonchi(wheezing sounds).That must be why the doc has given seroflo. The side effects of inhaled steroids are very minimal.The small amount of dosage directly reaches the  lungs. I would like to know your son's age. Any family history of skin allergies, asthma, or eczema? Is he using the seroflo rotacaps/inhaler? After 15 minutes of using the rotahaler/ inhaler, tell him to gargle his mouth with water(I don't know if the child is old enough to gargle, as the age of the child is not mentioned).What is the dosage advised and the duration of treatment?Kindly get back to me for any other queries.

This has caused blocked nose, loss of taste sensation and difficulty in breathing while sleeping. Beside this you may also be suffering from sinusitis causing headache. You should take antiallergics like cetrizine, antileukotriens like monteleukast(Montair), a corticosteroid nasal spray like fluticasone or budecort or fluticasone+azalastin combination for prompt relief. Take acitaminophen for headache. People with allergic diathesis(Atopy) also suffer from Br Asthma and GERD for which you may have to undergo some tests.

Now I live in Australia but here dont practec this treatment ... they sugest only pels but it doesn t work for me...","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to Healthcare Magic forum. Diprospan nasal spray contains betamethasone a corticosteroid  which can be used for severe cases of alergic rhinitis. Corticosteroid nasal sprays such as Nasonex and Rhinocort can also be used to relieve the symptoms of sinusitis, hay fever, allergic rhinitis and non-allergic (perennial) rhinitis. However,they can cause side effects such as headaches, nausea and nose bleeds.Hence their use should be limited and only on prescription. For symptomatic relief you can alternatively use anti histaminics either nasal sprays or oral pills available freely on prescription and over the counter. In Australia sprays like Telnase (Triamcinolone acetonide) and livostin (Levocabastine hydrochloride) are the popular products  on the market and are available over-the-counter. Please understand that allergy is best prevented than treated.So do consult an allergist for long term relief rather than repeated selfmedications providing temporary relief.

So, please maintain him on his prescribed medication (inhalers/ broncho-dilators etc and do not stop medication.

Now she is having fever means there is associated infection may be lung infection[as there is cold and cough]. Giving only ibugesic syrup which is pain killer, will not help. We need to find out the cause for fever and treat the cause [ i.e lung infection- bacterial/viral]. Cold and cough in asthma patient tend to trigger the asthma attack. So take extra precaution. Start steam inhalation. You can continue Cypon syrup which is decongestant. I would still suggest consult pediatrician, to treat cause for fever and prevent imminent asthma attack. I would recommend following things to avoid asthma related problem. Good hygiene can decrease viral infections such as colds. Prevent the spread of cold viruses by making sure you and your family members wash your hands regularly. Another way to protect yourself is to get a flu vaccine every year. Like colds, the flu is caused by a virus and can trigger asthma problems. Take care. Best regards, Dr. Neelam."},{"Patient":"Hi, my age is 58. My stomach is paining from last 45 days.

Early morning snnezing is also a sign of chronic allergy and some simple things to do over a few weeks would help you. Avoid dust exposure as much is possible, cover nostrils & mouth when be in a dusty situation. Try covering you head during night and identify whether morning sneezing also happens because of temprature variation during night (sleeping directly opposite a fan, extra cool or warm room etc). If so avoid this. For blacked nose take steam two-three tmes daily. Start breathing excercises..deep breath..hold..and release slowly.many times daily.

Anyways, after it happened 3 days ago, I got this really sharp pain in the left side of my neck near my Adam s Apple and have also lost a bit of my voice. Also, when I swallow it hurts and when I sneeze I get a really sharp pain in that same spot. I am also only a 33 yr. old male and an occasional smoker (2 to 3 cigarettes/day). Should I go and see my family physician about this problem or is there a way that I can treat it myself.","Doctor":"Hi there. Thanks for the query. Since you have severe sneezing, you may have damaged your throat lining a bit due to the violent sneezing. Since this occurs in the early morning, it is quite typical is Allergic rhinitis. Allergy is mainly due to cold temperature, pollen, certain food, drugs etc. The only way to avoid such attacks is to prevent the allergens as mentioned. Hence if you get in early morning it means you may also be allergic to cool temperature of early morning. Keep warm throughout the day and nigh with proper clothing and blankets respectively. Kinldy stop smoking otherwise you have higher chance for getting infection and delayed recovery. Kindly avoid hot fluids and hard food. Keep well hydrated. Eat a balanced diet. You can take anti-histamine like Cetrizine at night after Dinner which is anti-allergic medication and causes drowsiness also. Do salt water gargling to relieve yourself of the pain and throat swelling for 3-4 times a day. Wishing speedy recovery.

I would like to tell you one thing about the treatment of allergy. The only effective treatment of Allergy is avoidance of allergen ( Triggering factor). Any substance could be an allergen. Most common allergens for Naso bronchial allergy are dust and pollen. As far as the monteluKast is concerned - this is not useful in treating acute attack of allergy. It will help in reducing the frequency of allergic episodes. For it to be effective you might have to use it for years ( 2-3 Years). In very rare cases may have to be used for very long periods. Rotacaps will give you instant relief but will not effect the recurrence of allergic episodes. The only definitive treatment as i have mentioned earlier is avoidance of allergen. Just list out all the possible allergens with which you experience allergy. Try to avoid those allergens. Try using a cloth mask while going out. Using newer ntihistaminics like Fexofenadine 120 mg ( Allegra) will help you to counter acute attacks. Get your Blood Eosinophil count done. Based on the result. You can use some medicines like DEC ( Di  Ethyl carbamazine) which reduces the eosinophils and will prevent recurrent attacks of nasobronchial allergy. But please discuss with your doctor before you start using DEC . Hope you got some solution. Wish you a healthy day Take care"},{"Patient":"I ate mutton this afternoon.

Even if it has\`nt come out, it will be dealt by body defenses and may not cause any problem. However it can get lodged in the bronchial tree(airways) depending on it\`s size.It may lead to collapse of a portion of lung depending on the site of impaction and may lead to infection. If you are having symptoms, a chest xray or CT Scan should be done to confirm the diagnosis and to identify the site of impaction. Infection will have to be treated with antibiotics. Subsequently, it can be removed by performing a bronchoscopy."},{"Patient":"Hi I am AAAAAAA from Chennai. For last two years I am suffering with dust allergy .

About 4 months ago I had a few episodes were my eyes got very itchy and dry on and off and a few times I had some eye symptoms...minor swelling of the right upper eyelid , twice had a bubble which looked like a mosquito bite form under the eye (one time each eye) and another time I woke up with small to medium size bag under my left eye. Each time I felt fine other than the small amount of swelling and each time it was only in one eye, never both. In fact, most times I didn t realize until I went and looked in the mirror and then got scared after seeing the small amount of swelling. I also saw an eye doctor last fall after the first issue with it and the covering of my left eyeball was slightly fluid filled, which he said was due to an irritant and nothing to worry about. We had also found some black mold in our basement at that time that a plumber opened up the ceiling (so conceivably, some of these mold spores may have come out into the air...I had had no issues before this). I am now about 120 pounds (was 140 before I lost the weight) and female and 45 years old. I am a very nervous person and had been under severe stress for several months. It was during this time I started getting the eye symptoms. So stress, the mold issue and most likely the start of peri- menopause may all be contributing. Two of times I got the eye symptoms I had eaten peanut butter....but many hours beforehand. One time it was probably between 4-6 hours earlier and the second time, it was about 10-12 hours earlier. I had also had peanut butter in between with no symptoms. Each time I felt fine other than later on getting some eye symptoms. I had also, due to the stress, had lost 20 pounds during those months and once became dehydrated. Both times I had gotten the little bump under my eye (like a mosquito bite), I had been under acute stress both those days. Those are the only 2 times that ever happened. My general physician feels it s all stress-related and also seasonal allergies (I seem to have a little bit of hayfever). He said my symptoms are not consistent with food allergy or peanut butter allergy. Since not having any peanut products, I ve had no eye swelling, bags or bumps, but my stress level is also a LOT lower now. Should I get a blood allergy test for peanuts or is it most likely stress-related or hormone-related? Is it just a coincidence? Whenever I ve eaten peanut butter I always feel absolutely fine afterwards...even relaxed. No other symptoms...no rash, no breathing issues, nothing else. Being the nervous person I am though, I have worried that if the eye symptoms were related to the peanut butter, then my reaction could be worse next time. That s my main fear in trying the peanut butter again (as I said, I had been suffering anxiety and panic for several months, so my thought process became a little skewed). Would love to know if it s safe to just try the peanut butter again or if I should have the blood test. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for writing in. I think you should get yourself tested for an allergy to peanuts. Its unlikely that stress or hormonal issues are contributing to these allergies. I would suggest that you steer clear of peanuts for the time being as allergic reactions can be very severe  at times ( fatal reactions have also been reported) Try and reduce your anxiety levels with deep breathing and yoga. This should benefit you a great deal. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"i have had chronic rhinitis for the past year. it all started when i had my wisdom teeth surgically removed. the two bottom ones abcessed and i was sick for well over a month. after that i got a sinus infection. it was stubborn and i was prescribed about 6 courses of antibiotics of.all different kinds, none of which helped. i was then prescribed steroidal nasal spray . took twice a day for 5 months to no effect. by this point i was having almost no nasal discharge whatsoever and was mainly swollen to the point of not being able to breathe . i went to an ENT and had a camera up my nose and he found nothing and suggested nothing. he did however rule out allergies. in the last few days it has become unbearable. im beginning to physically feel sick, achey, lethargic and i am extremely tierd from lack of sleep. other symtoms include bad taste, stinging throat, watery eyes at night, head aches between eyes. please help.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcaremagic.com. Nonallergic rhinitis occurs when blood vessels in your nose expand (dilate), filling the nasal lining with blood and fluid. There are several possible causes of this abnormal expansion of the blood vessels or inflammation in the nose. But, whatever the trigger, the result is the same — swollen nasal membranes and congestion. Nonallergic rhinitis triggers include: 1)  Environmental or occupational irritants. Dust, smog, secondhand smoke or strong odors, such as perfumes, can trigger nonallergic rhinitis. Chemical fumes, such as those you might be exposed to in certain occupations, also may be to blame. 2)  Weather changes. Temperature or humidity changes can trigger the membranes inside your nose to swell and cause a runny or stuffy nose. 3)  Infections. A common cause of nonallergic rhinitis is a viral infection — a cold or the flu, for example. This type of nonallergic rhinitis usually clears up after a few weeks but can cause lingering mucus in the throat (postnasal drip). Sometimes, this type of rhinitis can become chronic, causing ongoing discolored nasal discharge, facial pain and pressure (sinusitis). 4)  Foods and beverages. Nonallergic rhinitis may occur when you eat, especially when eating hot or spicy foods. Drinking alcoholic beverages, such as beer and wine, also may cause the membranes inside your nose to swell, leading to nasal congestion. 5)  Certain medications. Some medications can cause nonallergic rhinitis. These include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others), and high blood pressure (hypertension) medications, such as beta blockers. Nonallergic rhinitis can also be triggered in some people by sedatives, antidepressants, oral contraceptives or drugs used to treat erectile dysfunction. Overuse of decongestant nasal sprays can cause a type of nonallergic rhinitis called rhinitis medicamentosa. 6)  Hormone changes. Changes in hormones due to pregnancy, menstruation, oral contraceptive use or a hormonal condition such as hypothyroidism can cause nonallergic rhinitis. 7)  Stress. Emotional or physical stress can trigger nonallergic rhinitis in some people. Some treatments include: 1)  Saline nasal sprays. Use an over-the-counter nasal saline spray or homemade saltwater solution to flush the nose of irritants and help thin the mucus and soothe the membranes in your nose. 2)  Corticosteroid nasal sprays. If your symptoms aren't easily controlled by decongestants or antihistamines, your doctor may suggest a prescription corticosteroid nasal spray, such as fluticasone (Flonase) or mometasone (Nasonex). Corticosteroid medications help prevent and treat inflammation associated with some types of nonallergic rhinitis. Possible side effects include indigestion, nausea, headache and bodily pains. 3)  Antihistamine nasal sprays. Try a prescription antihistamine spray such as azelastine (Astelin) and olopatadine hydrochloride (Patanase). While oral antihistamines don't seem to help nonallergic rhinitis, antihistamine in the form of a nasal spray may reduce symptoms of nonallergic rhinitis. Side effects may include a bitter taste in your mouth, headache and fatigue. 4)  Anti-drip anticholinergic nasal sprays. The prescription drug ipratropium (Atrovent) is often used as an asthma inhaler medication. But it's now available as a nasal spray and can be helpful if a runny, drippy nose is your main symptom. Side effects may include a bitter taste in your mouth and drying of the inside of your nose. 5)  Oral decongestants. Available over-the-counter or by prescription, examples include pseudoephedrine-containing drugs (Actifed, Sudafed, others) and phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine, others). These medications help narrow the blood vessels, reducing congestion in the nose. Possible side effects include high blood pressure, insomnia, loss of appetite, heart pounding (palpitations), anxiety and restlessness. 6)  Decongestant nasal sprays. These include oxymetazoline (Afrin, others). DON'T USE THESE MEDICATIONS FOR MORE THAN THREE OR FOUR DAYS, as they can cause congestion to come back with even worse symptoms when you stop using them. Other possible side effects include headache, insomnia and feeling nervous. Complications from nonallergic rhinitis include: 1)  Nasal polyps. These are soft, noncancerous (benign) growths that develop on the lining of your nose or sinuses due to chronic inflammation. Small polyps may not cause problems, but larger ones can block the airflow through your nose, making it difficult to breathe. 2)  Chronic sinusitis. Prolonged nasal congestion due to nonallergic rhinitis may increase your chances of developing sinusitis — an infection or inflammation of the membrane that lines the sinuses. When sinusitis lasts for longer than 12 consecutive weeks, it's referred to as chronic sinusitis. Sinusitis causes pain, tenderness and swelling around your eyes, cheeks, nose or forehead. There are certain things that you can do for yourself to help reduce discomfort and relieve the symptoms of nonallergic rhinitis: •  Rinse your nasal passages. Use a specially designed squeeze bottle, such as the one included in saline kits (Sinus Rinse, others), bulb syringe or neti pot to rinse your nasal passages. This home remedy, called nasal lavage, can help to keep your nose free of irritants. When used daily, this is one of the most effective treatments for nonallergic rhinitis. Use water that's distilled, sterile, previously boiled and cooled, or filtered using a filter with an absolute pore size of 1 micron or smaller to make up the irrigation solution. Also be sure to rinse the irrigation device after each use with similarly distilled, sterile, previously boiled and cooled, or filtered water and leave open to air dry. •  Blow your nose. Regularly and gently blow your nose if mucus or irritants are present. •  Humidify. Set up a humidifier in your work or sleep location. Or breathe in the steam from a warm shower to help loosen the mucus in your nose and clear your head of stuffiness. •  Stay hydrated. Drink plenty of liquids, such as water, juice or noncaffeinated tea. Avoid caffeinated beverages, which can cause dehydration and aggravate your symptoms Contact your family physician with your concerns and complications.  Together devise a strategy to eliminate your disease process. Be well, Dr. Kimberly"},{"Patient":"Hi I work for the nhs and understand this is free.

A fever of 102 and more is considered high for a young child but if it is controlled with antipyretics like acetaminophen then it's not necessarily an emergency. If your child has or develops any of the following then urgent care might be preferred rather than waiting for routine appointment. 1.Persistent fever or worsening fever despite antipyretics . 2.Noisy breathing or wheezing 3.Flaring of nose or fast breathing (>60 breaths/min) or continuous cough. 4.Decreased urination, lethargy, refusal to feeds or irritability indicating worsening of general condition.

Any particular reason?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to HCM, It is not clear from your question that at what time you use to take milk. In my opinion if you take milk in the morning, you will get less problems. But if you take it at bed time, can create more problems. As you are suffering with asthma, you can be allergic to milk protein also. And if you are allergic to milk protein, then every time you take milk, you will suffer with respiratory problems irrespective of time. The 2nd reason, which can cause problem is poor digestion of milk protein. I want to tell you that as our age advances, our ability to digest milk generally decreases due to poor secretion of enzyme responsible for it, which can cause flatulence & thus aggravate respiratory problems. Thus you should avoid all those foods, which aggravates your respiratory problems. Wish you good health,"},{"Patient":"I HAVE SOME KIND OF ALLERGY WHICH I AM UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND.

I AM FACING THE PROBLEM FROM PAST 6 MTS. IS THERE ANY PERMENANT SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM","Doctor":"Hello Thanks for your query. I will try my best to provide you with best possible professional recommendations to your questions. Allergies are pretty common. Both genes and environmental factors play a role. Common allergens include:Drugs, Dust, Food, Insect bites, Mold, Pet dander, Pollen. Some people have allergy-like reactions to hot or cold temperatures, sunlight, or other environmental triggers. I advice you to find out the cause which is responsible for it and then sensitization should be done. Allergy testing may be needed to find out whether the symptoms are an actual allergy or are caused by other problems. For example, eating contaminated food (food poisoning) may cause symptoms similar to food allergies. The best way to reduce symptoms is to avoid what causes your allergies. This is especially important for food and drug allergies. Allergy shots are sometimes recommended if you cannot avoid the allergen and your symptoms are hard to control. So i advice you to discuss with your dermatologist regarding this and work on it. Yet again, I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.

A few though report some side effects. The commonly reported side effects include: 1. Tablet Omnacortil is associated with gastritis/ulcers/dyspepsia; weight changes, high blood pressure and elevated blood sugars. Prolonged use is associated with calcium depletion and osteoporosis and one cannot stop it cold turkey. 2.

Spent yesterday with a mild fever and lots of coughing. I am an asthmatic so the added inflammation in my bronchial passageways is less than pleasant to say the least. Today I feel like I am on the up&up and the cough is no longer producing white sputum , but when I cough hard there is a metallic-type taste in my mouth. I figured it s normal since I spent the better part of 48 hours, day and night, hacking my lungs out. Anyway, is this normal or something to be concerned about? Thanks so much! -Jonathon","Doctor":"Hi, Viral fevers are known to be debilitating and sap a person's energy quickly. They manifest as anything from colds, to cough, to fever, to gastric disturbance and body aches. Altered taste in the mouth, or in your case, metallic taste is one of the symptoms of a viral infection because a virus can affect your sense of taste. Also, since you are an asthmatic, it is also possible that this added infection has caused you to breathe predominantly from your mouth making it dry, thereby giving a metallic tinge. Dehydration is also known to affect taste buds. Just make sure you drink lots of fluids, eat healthy meals and get adequate sleep and rest. All the best! dr.neharv@gmail.com"},{"Patient":"about 4 months ago i started having bleeding from my right nostril . no history of nosebleed. i also had one episode of severe vertigo . the nosebleeds were infrequent. now they happen almost daily. also had slight vertigo 2 days ago while quietly sitting. nosebleeds are sometimes dark and thick but mostly thin and bright red. sometimes from sneezing. other times they just start. what could be the cause and are the two things related?","Doctor":"HELLO & WELCOME TO HCM FORUM YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH ENT SURGEON TO GET RID OF THIS PROBLEM YOU MAY HAVE ABNORMAL BLOOD VESSELS, ANY POLPOIDAL GROWTH, DEVIATED NASAL SEPTUM  YOU SHOULD ALSO CONSULT WITH PHYSICIAN FOR YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE CHECKUP YOU MAY GET FAINTING ATTACKS BECAUSE OF SEVERE BLOOD LOSS AND MAY BE FEAR AFTER WATCHING BLOOD TAKE CARE & GET WELL SOON DR. MAYANK BHARGAVA"},{"Patient":"Hello, I have been suffering from a tingling/itching sensation for almost a year now, often building up to a burning sensation in my feet , and at some points there has been nausea/ vomiting . I am someone that is prone to allergies , and I have been tested and found allergic to dust mites, and I have been taking cetirizine to control the reactions. I definitely believe that I’m having an allergic reaction to something, but I am concerned that dust mites may not be the right diagnosis. It feels to me as though I have something microscopic that moves around my body, sometimes in what feels like a great quantity. The question is this: if it was something other than a dust mite (eg: scabies mite), would it be normal for them to move around to different parts of the body? I appear to have no lesions and have not generally suffered from rashes etc., but over the past week I have been suffering from a more intense itching than before and a rash that seems to disappear once I apply creams. This might be a reaction to extreme cold weather or excessive bathing – my allergy doctor has told me to stop taking baths, but it’s difficult to follow this guideline, when the dust mite theory isn’t 100% sure. What is certain is that when I stop taking baths, the nature of the itch changes to a tickling sensation, but I get the feeling that there is an increase in number of whatever this is. Is it really possible that this could be dust mites? The doctor told me to take one cetirizine a day, but it can take up to 4 to make me feel any better. What could the result of taking so much cetirizine be? Ps. The allergy doctor also did blood tests to rule out any internal problems that could be causing paraesthesia, and earlier last year I had a checkover by a dermatologist and a parasite doctor.","Doctor":"hi taniya good morning, welcome me dr chisty from ayurveda speciality is giving you the suggestion like it is clearly mentioned as a disease in ayurvedic terxts namly udardham and special treatments also there for this. it is due to the alteration of our immune system only the line of treatment to improve your immunity if you wish we c an go for the therapy simply taking citrazene and stopping bath is not the solution writ to us christyjoseph1@gmail.com"},{"Patient":"I had my gallbladder out last month and an umbilical hernia repaired. I did do some strenuos ab excersise this week but the soreness went away and now I have a ripping sensation right under my belly button and there is a red area that keeps appearing under my belly button about 2 inches straight down. I am also having diarehha now about 30 minutes every time I eat something. I am still able to function and I ran 3 miles today so I am thinking nothing serious but my belly just looks puffy and weird.","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query and an elucidate history. You have undergone 2 surgeries- one for gall bladder removal and another for umbilical hernia repair. The burning sensation and the red area below the belly button is suggestive there is a nerve entrapment in the hematoma or a stitch or a developing scar. The redness can be due to hematoma below or a mild infection. I would advise in such a case the following:Aspirate the area, see the color, consistence of the fluid, if clear or amber color this is just a seroma and needs no active treatment  If pus like, send the material for culture and sensitivity Start on the antibiotics. and be under observation of a Doctor , do not worry, this will be fine soon."},{"Patient":"A 12 year child who is using Asthalin inhaler and Flohale Inhaler. I would like to know the long term side effects of the same.","Doctor":"Hi welcome to HCM. Asthalin or salbutamol can increase the heart rate. When used as inhaler the ill effects are almost 60% less as compared to when it is given orally as a syrup or tablet. Flohale contains steroid . Corticosteroids can lead to fluid retention in body, increase in blood pressure, and precipitation of Diabetes if used for long. But again these problems are almost negligible when used as inhaler. Ideally, Flohale should be used daily as a preventive and Asthalin used only when symptoms are severe or before exercise or dust exposure when an attack can be expected. Hope this satisfactorily answers your query. Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi I had a CT scan confirm I have chronic sinusitis and also I have asthma . For over six months now, I noticed when I spit in to a glass water, this constant thick clear phlegm comes out all day long -NON -STOP , thick looking. When I spit in to a glass of water, it appears cloudy and streaks down and settles at the bottom looking cloudy white. Also, the phlegm is thicker in the morning when I wake up. I have been taking predisone , Amoxicillin , doing Nasal Netti pot, and Accupuncture and nothing seems to be curing it. I am wondering if I have candidasis ? At one time my mucus was thick yellow but after taking amoxiciling the sinus infection cleared, but still the thick mucus is coming all day long. Any idea what tests I should have done or what it might be?","Doctor":"Hi Genxbtq, Chronic Sinusitis and Asthma both can cause this type of mucoid sputum. When there is yellowish or green sputum from nose or mouth along with other symptoms like facial pain, cough, loss of smell and taste etc, there is an indication for Antibiotics. Once you start antibiotics, remember to continue it for longer duration ( not usual 5 days course) like 10-14 days for Chronic Sinusitis. I hope you are taking Inhaler for prevention of Asthma. The dose, and duration of Prednisolone tablet should be guided by your doctor. I would also advise you to increase the dose of preventive inhaler, as soon as you see any first symptoms of flu, sinusitis, allergic Rhinitis. Every year you should take Vaccine against Flu, and you must also take Vaccination against Pneumonia. You must continue doing steam inhalation two times in a day as a routine. Take good care of your food, and heigene. Avoid any allergen, if you have any. Wish you a stable health."},{"Patient":"ALLERGY - Respiratory .

He started to throw up when we go to the ER and became pale.  A type of Cat scan through the rectum showed enlarged lymph nodes and his blood work showed  a high lymphocyte count, along with cloudy urine.  His temperature stayed a little over 98 degrees and no diarrhea.  The doctor sent him home with pain and nausea medication and said return if he spikes a fever and /or pain gets worse.  He is still tender to the touch and sleeping most the day, normally very active doing card type workouts.  He is tall and slender, with not much body fat, and the doctor said it is makes the test procedure more uncomfortable and difficult to be too conclusive counting out an appendicitis.  Could this be just a virus since the pain is more uncomfortable and tender to the touch below his belly button and to his right?  Wouldn't a virus cause a fever?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query and an elucidate history. This is a typical situation where the young present with pain in abdomen and associated severe problems like falling pale.Since the CT scan has shown the enlarged lymph nodes, the diagnosis is certainly related to the lymph nodes. Although there is no diarrhea, lymph nodes should be investigated, if possible get an appointment with interventional radiologist to do an FNAC of the lymph node under ultrasonography guidance. If this fails I would advise to get a course of an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory course for up to 3 weeks, review the lymph nodes by ultrasonography. IF still present , better to do diagnostic laparascopy and to do a formal biopsy. This does not look to be due to virus as there will be pain and other general symptoms also. Virus may or may not cause fever."},{"Patient":"hi doc. my mother suffering from skin allergy due 2 hair dye no medicine works... plz tell me wat to do...","Doctor":"Hi Zoya,Welcome to HCM.Ideal would be to discontinue the use of hair dye.

I mustered enough adrenaline to keep getting back up, make it down 3 flights of stairs, to sit by my car and call a friend to come pick me up.

If I do turn them on , it tends to include muscular tremors - not the smooth motion I m used to. I can, however, (ultimately) sleep it off. It s almost like I m drunk.

As far as Asthma is concerned, its mode of inheritance is polygenetic, that means, more than one gene is responsible for inheritance of asthma from parents to children. This certainly puts the child in a higher risk group for asthma. But this DOESNOT mean the child will be asthmatic for sure. The genes for asthma are mostly triggered by environmental factors , ( like smoke, dust, pollens, cold air, strenous exercise etc ) and protection of children from such factors will delay the onset and reduce severity of the diseases to a considerable extent.

THANKS"},{"Patient":"hi doctor I am suffering from cold from 1 month. from last two days I am getting bad smell in my nose and my breath also. what should I do ?please give me suggestion.","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for posting the query. There could be several reasons for bad smell in the nose and breath. It could be due to poor oral hygiene. A second reason is a non-allergic, non-infectious inflammation in the sinuses that can linger after a cold. A third reason is chronic sinusitis. In your case, it looks like you have developed sinusitis after cold. Inflammation in the sinuses can block sinus drainage. This can cause the mucus to collect in your nose and sinuses.  Over time this collection of mucus can smell really bad. If the mucus is thick, a nasal wash may be needed to remove it from your nose and sinuses. Steam inhalation will help you. Do maintain good oral hygiene. You may have short-term relief from the bad smell, but it may return again if the blockage is not completely cleared. If this continues, check with your doctor to see if a decongestant like Sudafed (pseudoephedrine) would clear this blockage so the mucus drains from your sinuses. Your doctor may also recommend a prescription of nasal steroid spray. This decreases the inflammation in your nose and sinus and the mucus production.  Generally a nasal steroid spray keeps your sinuses draining better.  This may prevent the mucus from collecting in your nose and sinuses. To get the most help from a nasal steroid spray use it after doing a nasal wash. I hope I have answered your query. I will be available if you have any follow up query. Wishing you a fast recovery.

I ve chosen to heal without medications (chemo) and I was doing very well before my neighbors came about. For the past 11 months my next door neighbors have been smoking and producing meth.

Every morning my lungs are EXTREMELY irritated and outside air seems to be contaminated also. When I am away from home I feel better. No one seems to understand my chest discomfort even if they cannot smell it.

Others have been pretty solid but also a yellow color. I can t remember the last time I changed a dark brown diaper. Could this be caused by the teething, a cold, milk allergy?","Doctor":"Hi Thanks for posting your query. There are few problems expected during teething like irritation, excessive cry, excessive salivation, diarrhea. Constipation is as such not noticed during teething. But, stomach upset is expected due to infection as child keeps sucking the things due irritation in the gums. Even cold is not directly related to constipation. It would be of great if you provide me some more information to guide you better. Since how long your child is having constipation? Did constipation start after introducing any weaning food? Is she on any formula milk? Constipation could be due to intolerance to some food especially milk. It is more with formula milk compared to breast milk/cow milk. Introducing fiber-rich foods into her diet, such as fruits, vegetable purees and cereals like porridge will help. Fluids are equally important and the baby should be given plenty to drink for example water and diluted fruit juice. Massaging the baby's tummy can help relieve some of the tension in the bowels.

Is it asthma, COPD, ILD, heart disease or something else (or a combination of many)? You said it is asthma. Has it been confirmed? She is asthmatic since how long? The extent of breathlessness is severe. Remember, asthma is a treatable disease and so severe breathlessness concerns us. Your short history points toward COPD than asthma.

Breathlessness on exertion and easy fatiguebility can be due to several reasons . Most common cause in a female being ANAEMIA i.e low heamoglobin. Most common cause for Low heamoglobin is iron deficiency. In females because of monthly periods , they loose blood and hence are more prone to anaemia than men. However heart or lung problems can also cause your symptoms. So my advice would be visit a physician( to check your heart and lung status) , get few blood tests done - 1) CBC-complete blood counts 2) Iron profile 3) Peripheral smear , these 3 basic blood tests tell you , the reason for low heamoglobin and you can be treated accordingly with ferrous sulphate tabs and Vit B12 and folic acid tablets.

I often feel out of breath even when talking like i have just done exercise. whats wrong with me?","Doctor":"hello. my name is dr waleed. actually it is not possible from the history you have given to reach a diagnosis but i can tell you that you must see a doctor very soon so that he can take a complete history and do a physical examination and then do necessary investigations. in this way it would be possible to reach the diagnosis. From whatever history you have given, i can tell you this. you may possibly be losing too much blood that can make you anemic. Severe anemia can make you breathless and cause you dizziness(light-headedness) but that will not explain the nausea though. Also, if you meant \\"vertigo ie the world spins around\\" by dizziness that would be more alarming though. a benign pituitary tumour can be a possible cause too that cause the nausea,vertigo, and irregular menses. if you have vision problems too, then it can be more likely. A pituitary tumour would not explain not the abdominal pain unless unrelated.another possibility is that you are bleeding into your stomach or intestine (is your stool colour blacK?, if so think of bleeding into stomach or early part of small intestine). it will explain the abdominal pain nausea lightheadedness and breathlessness.Polyarteritis nodosa can explain all these symptoms except the irregular vaginal bleeding.Conclusion: please go to your doctor soon for a full workup"},{"Patient":"Started out as an alleric reaction.

Kindly don't lose hope. Learn more about this condition, this will help you stick to your Treatment plan and will help you understand your condition better. Exercise regularly and eat healthy nutritious balanced diet like fresh fruits and green leafy vegetables. Maintain a healthy weight and avoid stress.

She has neither cough nor any lession or protrution on her body but every night the tenperature raises upto 101.Can you please tell us which type of TB is this?","Doctor":"Hi.  Welcome To HealthcareMagic A strongly reactive Mantoux means that she has been exposed to tuberculosis bacilli and she has developed hypersensitivity to tubercular protein, which is measured by the diameter of induration (red swelling) after 48-72 hours that develops at the site of tuberculin injection given intradermally (in the skin of the forearm). A positive Mantoux test doesn't always mean someone has TB disease; it just means that the bacteria have been in the body at some time. Also, a diagnosis of tuberculosis is never based solely on a Mantoux/PPD tuberculosis test. False-positive reactions to the tuberculosis skin test can occur because of:Infection with non-tuberculous or atypical mycobacteria. I recommend chest X ray and sputum for AFB three times.

Mold can cause VERY serious health problems! It depends on the type of mold but it should be taken very seriosly. I know three girls that were living in a house with mold and 2 out of 3 of them suffered different effects. One girl who had asthma had her asthma worsen significantly because of it, and as a result began to experience arrhythmia (irregular heart beat) from it. She was living in the basement were there was the highest concentration of mold. The other girl was having problems with dizziness and light headedness which sometimes lead to nausea and the doctor couldn't figure out why. When they discovered the mold and had it taken care of all of their symptoms gradually vanished completely!? Luckily they weren't living there for a long time. I hope you figured out your problems long ago but just wanted to make sure you understood how seriously mold can affect our health!

Many thanks","Doctor":"Avoid any obvious triggers or exacerbating factors and try these simple measures:  1) Keep the skin cool, avoid getting hot from exercise and take lukewarm baths. Resist the temptation to rub the itchy skin and apply copious amounts of moisturizing creams to reduce dryness and itch. 2) Avoid alcoholic drinks and foods containing additives.  3) Apply 1% menthol in aqueous cream to soothe the affected skin.  4) Avoid all aspirin or codeine containing medication (including ibuprofen, diclofenac and mefenamic acid). Only use paracetamol as a painkiller.  5) Carefully read Side Effects list of any other medication you are currently taking and avoid medicines that are known to trigger urticaria or angioedema.   The mainstay of treatment is high dose ANTIHISTAMINE medication which may be necessary for prolonged periods (in excess of 6 weeks). Double conventional doses of antihistamines may be needed for symptom relief. Occasionally \\"stomach-ulcer treatment\\" medication such as Cimetidine and Ranitidine which are known to also dampen down histamine release are added. New leukotriene receptor antagonists used for asthma have produced some symptom relief in chronic urticaria which you can discuss with your treating doctor. Short courses of oral steroids may be necessary to settle more severe symptoms can be tried with doctor?s advice only. Cortisone should not be used for prolonged periods of time as they may lead to osteoporosis in adults. Sometimes special investigations are done if the condition is recurring and find out the rarer causes.

Find a doctor in your area that specializes in candida overgrowth and food allergies and you will feel empowered as a parent because you can finally work together to treat the cause.  It is classic the ear infections, skin problems, coughing and runny nose sinus problems are all from this.

I have been back to the gastro and told him this can't keep going on and he did send me to a surgeon who said that the hida scan cramping is a sign of gallbladder as well as other symmtoms.  He did say he would take it out.  I have talked with the gastro guy and he said that if it inteferes with your lifetstyle and work then have it removed.

It started very suddenly on November 11th. It started as dull pain and discomfort on my left side and progressed to more of a sharp pain. I ended up going to the doctor after I had 3 instances where I passed gas and had completely clear, gel like discharge in my pants. One instance there was a circle of this gel stuff that was probably 5 inches in diameter and 1/4 inch thick. By this point, my stool was completely liquid with mucus or fat init. When I went to my pcp, she thought it was cholitis. She put me on 2 antibiotics, took a stool sample, and referred me to a gastro. The stool sample came back clear.I saw the gastro after I was almost done with the antibiotics. They did a cat scan with contrast. I was told the results were clear. They then performed a colonoscopy, which came back clear as well as the biopsies taken from the colon being clear. At this point, the gastro told me it was ibs. I told him that I was having instances where there were noises in the left side of my abdomen as if someone where overturning a large bottle of water and the large bubbles were rushing up, which was followed by discomfort. I also told him that the issues weren’t accompanied by pain. He tested for celiac, which was negative, He was insistent that it was ibs and wouldn’t test for anything else.I went to another gastro for a 2nd opinion about a month and a half ago and she said she thought it was either post-colitis ibs or SIBO. Instead of waiting for a breath test, she put me on a 2 week round of extremely strong antibiotics. I went back 1 week after finishing the antibiotics due to continued discomfort, brief periods of pain, and mucus. She gave orders for blood tests to test my thyroid and an X-ray to look to see how full my colon is. This was almost 2 weeks ago and I haven’t heard anything.Yesterday morning, I woke up slightly nauseated (for the first time during all of this) and didn’t go to work. I started going to the bathroom frequently around 4:00pm or so. Every time it’s soft, but not liquid, with mucus/fat/bile. At around 9:00pm, I started having sharp pain in my left side. By 2am, it was so painful I almost couldn’t stand straight (I stayed in the living room instead of going to bed because I kept getting up). When I woke up today, it was still painful, but not debilitating, and I was in the bathroom all day again with the same results. As of about 10:00 tonight until now (130a), it’s horrible. Very sharp pain that is radiating to my back and down to my hip. It is almost bad enough that I feel like I should go to the ER, but I don’t even know what they would test for. If they tell me again that it’s just Ibs and they can’t do anything for me, I don’t know what I’ll do. It’s so painful right now and nothing is helping. Does anyone have any idea to what I should test for? I’m desperate.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.

So I'm sorry my dear but if you are sure its diverticulitis then broad spectrum antibiotic have to be taken for 5 to 7 days.I would suggest you take Clindamycin 600 mg once daily with Metronidazole 400 mg thrice daily for 5 days.They would cover both bacteria as well as protozoa, however, you would need a prescription for the same as antibiotics are not over the counter.Probiotic etc would help but if its diverticulitis then you have to take antibiotics.

Please explain how these drugs works and is it safe to take them for long periods. Age: 67 Gender: Female. History: Wheezing and breathlessness and Phlem since more than 25 years","Doctor":"I understand from the background you have given that you have asthma. Here, your airways tend to over-react to triggers like dust, cold air, strong odors, smoke, etc. which cause the airways to narrow temporarily. After the triggers are gone, the airway returns to its normal size. But over a long term this repeated narrowing and widening can lead to loss of their \\"elasticity\\" and permanent narrowing. Asthma is an airway problem that can be controlled but not cured. The most important medicines to relieve and control asthma are those that cause widening of the airways and those that prevent permanent damage. In your case they are Formoterol and Budesonide respectively (contained in Formonide). Since these medicines act for a maximum of 12 hours you need to take these medicines twice daily EVERY DAY. Together they control your current episode AND prevent further episodes. The dose may be reduced over a period of time if you show good response and withstand reduced dose ONLY IN CONSULTATION WITH YOUR PULMONOLOGIST during REGULAR FOLLOW-UP. Regarding side effects - since these medicines are inhaled and taken to the lungs where their action is required, they do not reach other parts of the body in significant amounts to cause significant side effects. When compared to oral and i.v medications used to treat asthma, the inhaled medications are far superior w.r.t their side effect profile. If you have allergy of the nose - runny nose, sneezing the Montelukast-Levocetrizine combination(NecMonto-L) will help. Regarding this your pulmonologist will decide the ideal time to discontinue."},{"Patient":"I have shortness of breath , i have no other symptoms other than coughing and wheezing, i use my nebulizer but it doesnt fully relieve my shortness of breath, over the past couple of days i have drank many bottles of water, what else should i do? this happens every time i get a cold, my shortness of breath is moderately severe unless i use my nebulizer","Doctor":"If your wheezing is so severe that you need to use nebulised medicines, it shows that your problem is not under control.

Such a severe pain in abdomen of the character of twisting can come due to an intestinal obstruction due to many reasons like, kinking, stricture or a cancer; or can occur due to a condition called a volvulus of the intestines in which the part of the gastrointestinal tract can get twisted at two points.The simplest test is X-ray of the intestines / abdomen in a standing position. You may need an urgent surgery to relieve / correct one. I would advise you to rush to ER and get admitted investigated and operated if it is a must."},{"Patient":"i have sever sneezing when goes to a room which was closed for long time and also when exposed to dust.What may  be the cause .what are the preventive measures that can be taken from home.and best treatment for that.also my eosinophils count is 7%.What is the normal count needed.","Doctor":"Hi.. These are allergic symptoms.. The best method of preventing these episodes are by avoiding the allergens.. Measures such as keeping nose and mouth closed using the mask or cloth when entering the dusty rooms, regular cleaning of the room, washing the bedsheets and pillow covers, keeping the curtains closed and so on is essential.. Severe symptoms can be controlled by use of antiallergic medications..

Caffeine is known to speed up your heart rate there for putting undue stress on your breathing. A cup of hot lemonade...just like tea, without the tea also helps by opening the airways and the nasal passages."},{"Patient":"how best is it to avoid allergic reactions?","Doctor":"You have asked a general query about allergic reaction. First and foremost thing you need to do is to stay away from the substance causing allergy. In food allergies, avoiding the allergen is a life-saving necessity. That's because, unlike allergies to airborne particles that can be treated with shots or medications, the only way to treat food allergies is to avoid the allergen entirely. For example, people who are allergic to peanuts should avoid not only peanuts, but also any food that might contain even tiny traces of them. Avoidance can help protect people against non-food or chemical allergens, too. Eliminating exposure to an allergen is enough to prevent allergy symptoms and they don't need to take medicines or go through other allergy treatments. Here are some things that can help you avoid airborne allergens: 1) Keep family pets out of certain rooms, like your bedroom, and bathe them if necessary. 2) Remove carpets or rugs from your room (hard floor surfaces don't collect dust as much as carpets do). 3) Don't hang heavy drapes, and get rid of other items that allow dust to accumulate. 4) Clean frequently (if your allergy is severe, you may be able to get someone else to do your dirty work!) 5) Use special covers to seal pillows and mattresses if you're allergic to dust mites. 6) If you're allergic to pollen, keep windows closed when pollen season's at its peak, change your clothing after being outdoors ? and don't mow lawns. 7) Avoid damp areas, such as basements, if you're allergic to mold, and keep bathrooms and other mold-prone areas clean and dry."},{"Patient":"Had a cut and bruised knee after a fall durign a game of cricket.

If this is so you may need another corrective surgery to remove pressure on the nerves. IF the MRI is normal then obviously local causes have to be searched with the help of your General Surgeon, investigations should be planned after a physical examination, which may be in the form ultrasonography, blood, urine and stool tests.

Thanks, Bryan","Doctor":"Right for now, a moisturiser is good enough."},{"Patient":"Hi doc, how is allergy testing done? Could you tell me more about hypo sensitization or Desensitization?","Doctor":"Nice to see someone interested in knowing about allergy and hypo sensitization. Allergy testing is used to identify an allergen. Skin testing is the most common method used to determine an allergen, because several allergens can be tested safely at the same time. Allergy testing is not a treatment, nor is it always accurate. You can also find out the allergen yourself in the daily life to the foods, perfumes, or the atmosphere that triggers the allergic reaction to you. Hypo sensitization is one of the two methods of treatment of allergy.  Hypo sensitization, or desensitization, involves injections of tiny amounts of the known allergen. The amount of the allergen is gradually increased per injection until you are able to tolerate exposure to the allergen with only mild symptoms. Hypo sensitization takes 3 - 6 months to begin to work, and it is usually continued for 3 - 5 years. It is expensive and provides varying degrees of success, depending on the condition. Hypo sensitization usually begins when maximum avoidance and medical therapy is unsuccessful, and the allergic condition is interfering with your life, such as causing you to miss many days of school, work, etc., or requiring many emergency room visits for care."},{"Patient":"for the last couple of years i've been getting extremely light-headed sometimes with black spots flickering over my eyes. also my limbs sometimes go numb and give out. especially my legs.

Steroids work short term. Has anyone had any success with something different? She is only 25 and it really bothers her. Many thanks","Doctor":"Avoid any obvious triggers or exacerbating factors and try these simple measures: 1) Keep the skin cool, avoid getting hot from exercise and take lukewarm baths. Resist the temptation to rub the itchy skin and apply copious amounts of moisturizing creams to reduce dryness and itch. Avoid alcoholic drinks and foods containing additives. 2) Apply 1% menthol in aqueous cream to soothe the affected skin. 3) Avoid all aspirin or codeine containing medication (including ibuprofen, diclofenac and mefenamic acid). Only use paracetamol as a painkiller. 4) Carefully read Side Effects list of any other medication you are currently taking and avoid medicines that are known to trigger urticaria or angioedema. The mainstay of treatment is high dose ANTIHISTAMINE medication which may be necessary for prolonged periods (in excess of 6 weeks). Double conventional doses of antihistamines such as Cetirizine, Loratidine may be needed for symptom relief. Occasionally \\"stomach-ulcer treatment\\" medication is added. New leukotriene receptor antagonists used for asthma have produced some symptom relief in chronic urticaria.. Short courses of steroids may be necessary to settle more severe symptoms. Cortisone should not be used for prolonged periods of time as they may lead to stunted growth in children and osteoporosis in adults. Specialist investigations in Chronic Urticaria may be necessary to exclude other underlying illnesses or to confirm the presence of ?auto-antibodies? in the blood stream. The Autologous Serum Skin Test (ASST) is a good indicator of Auto-antibodies. Highly specialised treatments may include Immunosuppressive drugs (Cyclosporine, Methotrexate, and Azathioprine), Androgens and Warfarin. Colchicine is useful in treating Urticarial Vasculitis. If available, Immunoglobulin injections, Plasmaphoresis or the use of novel anti-IgE monoclonal antibodies such as Omalizumab may be necessary. The future holds many exciting new therapeutic modalities including DNA Plasmid Vaccines"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, my father is diagnosed with celiac disease and was told he was allergic to gluten. It would be nice if u could give me an insight regarding the above said condition and gluten allergy.","Doctor":"Coming to the first part of your question, Gluten Intolerance or Celiac Disease is a hereditary problem affecting the immune system. The consumption of gluten destroys the lining of the small intestine called mucosa. Consequently, essential vitamins and nutrients are not properly absorbed.  As for as the second part of your question, Grains like wheat, barley, rye, and low level oats contain a rubbery substance called gluten, which is a protein that helps in binding the dough. It is commonly used in baked breads and other baked foods. Though gluten causes gluten allergy in sensitive people, there are many other proteins that can trigger allergic symptoms. The symptoms and intensity of the symptoms of gluten allergy can differ from person to person. But the general symptoms are hives, swelling, abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting, or asthma. For a person extremely sensitive to gluten allergy, the symptoms can be fatal. So We advice you to take precautions about your diet. You can visit a nutritionist to plan for gluten free diet."},{"Patient":"I have upper abdominal pain that leads towards the back. I sometimes get nauseas.

Atopic dermatitis is sometimes called eczema or atopic eczema. But atopic dermatitis is only one of many types of eczema .Atopic dermatitis is a long-lasting skin problem. It causes dry skin, intense itching, and then a red, raised rash. In severe cases, the rash forms clear, fluid-filled blisters. It cannot be spread from person to person. Atopic dermatitis is most common in babies and children. Some children with atopic dermatitis outgrow it or have milder cases as they get older. You may also get atopic dermatitis as an adult.. Most people who have atopic dermatitis have a personal or family history of allergies, such as hay fever and asthma. The skin inflammation that causes the atopic dermatitis rash is thought to be a type of allergic response. Things that may make atopic dermatitis worse include stress, certain foods, such as eggs, peanuts, milk, wheat, or soy products, allergens, such as dust mites or animal dander, harsh soaps or detergents, weather changes, especially dry and cold and also skin infection."},{"Patient":"I have continuous cold and wheezing problem in bangalore from last 5 years.

Also, sometimes when I m running my stomach feels like it s burning and I just finished running today and I feel really really light-headed. Is this normal?

You must run all year around, somewhere!! Find an indoor track or use the basketball court and just make laps around the perimeter as well as the old coaches trick of running up and down the bleachers.  Yeah!! it is harsh!!

It was found I sprained my ankle and was told I also had a Heart Murmur.Now I am a bit worried.I had been sick for 3 days prior to my ankle injury and was experienceing dizzyness paleness,and shortness of breath . And I realized that these are some of the symptoms of a Heart Murmur, but did not know this while I was at the doctor. I also have asthma so I figured that was what was causing my symptoms. But I dont believe it is the asthma acting up, since I have had to use Abuterol more than four times this week. I didnt tell the doctor this, he is not my regular doctor. What test should I have done, I have had a Stress test, Heart Imaging test, and electrocardiogram two months ago, and they turned out to be normal. Should I be concerned about the doctors findings on the heart murmur.","Doctor":"A lot of the answers you have received are correct. Albuterol speeds your heart up, So you should be on a preventive medication to keep your asthma under control. A heart murmur can be caused by many things. Has your doctor referred you to a heart specialist or is he doing these tests on his own. I have had the tests that you have mentioned. They showed nothing of my heart condition. The less invasive tests are an echocardiogram and now there is talk that an MRI can also show what is going on with your heart. The symptoms you mentioned could be a sign of something serious. I am not trying to scare you. You do need to see a specialist if he doesn't do more tests and you continue to have the same symptoms. Go to an ER next time and let them admit you and run the tests. The next step after the tests I mentioned would be a heart catherization, you will be put in twilite sleep while they perform that procedure. That test is usually the last one they perform but they get a better picture of what is wrong with your heart or if you have a blockage, mitral valve prolapse or mitral reguritation which is what I was finally diagnosed with. Do seek your answers from a cardiologist. Ask your physician for a referral to go. It is your right as a patient and his duty to give you the referral. If you get no where, find another doctor."},{"Patient":"I am scared because I don t know if this is stress or really a heart problem? Last friday (last week, not this past friday) I had been experiencing difficulty breathing, more pronounced then usual. I went to the doctor and they did an EKG and said I had AF, so I had to go to the ER, where they did another EKG and said it looked normal, and the doctor EKG looked normal (they say) and that there were artifacts that were contributing to it. I am still not convinced. Can an EKG reading be abnormal one instance then an hour later be back to normal? I am scared because no one will try to conform anything, and if I ask to go to the doctor one more time I m afraid my mom is going to slap me X_X She really can t afford all this. I normally don t breathe really deep, it s somewhat shallow, and everyone pointing this out has me worried now. For the past month I ve had alot of chest tightness. A panic attack only lasts a little while, but the chest tightness/pain doesn t go away, and my heart beat still feels very odd every so often (like there are extra beats) They said it sounded fine but these weird beats come and go. I m scared because I don t want to have to sit around until it gets worse or something bad happens. They ve done bloodwork a few weeks ago and last week (never heard about last weeks) and said it was ok. I ve had numerous x-rays done the past month (one at the ER too) and they said it looked ok. I just don t know what to do. I m mostly bothered by the difference in the 2 EKGs, and why it would point to me having AF if I supposedly don t have it. I don t know, CAN it just be stress/anxiety? This weakness and shortness of breath (even though im getting enough oxygen) and the constant discomfort in my chest has made me loose so much sleep, and i ve got so much tension pain from that and so many aches in my legs and arms . I am not sure what is what, and it s scaring me. I m 17, btw. I have been tested for asthma twice in my lifetime, I don t have asthma, and they kept trying to give me asthma medicine that did not do anything :P So I m pretty sure by now I don t have asthma. Nothing directly causes the chest tightness.","Doctor":"Chest tightness and difficulty breathing are normal symptoms of Anxiety disorder but it's also normal symptoms for Asthma.  I would get heart palpitations (irregular heart beat), and shooting pains through my chest and arms.  The only way to find out if you have asthma is to take the medication for a test run. If you feel better after using it, then its just that.  The doctor can also put you on a test run of anti anxiety medication for a week or so.  It's best to just give it a try to find out what you have, because anxiety and asthma are difficult to diagnose by having tests done.  As for the type of anxiety medication you should try, I would recommend Effexor XR, or something similar. You can ask your doctor. I wouldn't recommend Zoloft as it can make you depressed.  It is possible for one test to come back differently than another. It can all depends on alot of different factors.

Lungs can not open and deliver oxygen to the blood, so you are tired and your heart hurts a little too.  I would think that is your asthma acting up.  You can ask a pharmacist for something over the counter, but you should see your doctor.  Asthma can be aggravated by pollen and dust outside, or dust inside, too.  A thorough complete cleaning, vacuuming, dusting of your house or apartment is a very good idea.  Also, clean air filters for the A/C.

Narcan competes for opiate receptors and will reverse the sedative and respiratory depressive effects but not the immune response.

Exercise and extreme activity level  can cause rapid heart palpitations or the feelings of the heart racing or pounding.; which in turn exacerbates the asthmatic attacks. The symptoms you describe; e;g; SOB with mild exertion, and heart palpitations might just be an anxiety behavioral disorder.  Or it could be the side effect of the asthmatic drugs.  Pls review my detailed answer.   Palpitations are heartbeat sensations that feel like pounding or racing. Does your heart rate feel slow or fast when you have these hard palpitations?   Heart palpitations can be caused by:  Exercise Anxiety, stress, fear Fever Caffeine, nicotine, cocaine, diet pills Overactive thyroid Anemia Hyperventilation Low levels of oxygen in your blood Medications such as thyroid pills, asthma drugs, beta blockers for high blood pressure or heart disease, or anti-arrhythmics (medications to treat an irregular heart rhythm can sometimes cause a different irregular rhythm) Mitral valve prolapse -- the valve that separates the left upper chamber (atrium) from the left lower chamber (ventricle) of the heart does not close properly Heart disease.   Shortness of breath (SOB)  from heart failure  Depending on the stage of heart failure, shortness of breath may occur:  With exertion or exercise. At rest. While lying down (orthopnea). This often is relieved by sitting up or standing. At night, and it may occur with waking up coughing and/or wheezing, having a rapid heart rate, and a feeling of being suffocated (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or PND)  What characterizes shortness of breath from heart failure?  People with heart failure experience shortness of breath in many different ways. Most people describe it as being winded, having a tightness in the chest, or even feeling tired while walking. You may also experience shortness of breath from heart failure at specific times—when you exercise or overexert yourself, while you are lying down, and while you are sleeping.   Shortness of breath from exertion. If your shortness of breath is not severe, you may notice it only when you are exerting yourself, and sometimes only during more intense exertion. For example, you may notice that you are short of breath after walking up three flights of stairs, whereas before, you were comfortable walking up four flights. The medical term for this symptom is dyspnea (DISP-nee-ah).   When heart failure develops gradually, your shortness of breath also may develop gradually, which can make it hard to notice. People with more severe heart failure, however, may experience shortness of breath with minimal exertion, even from just combing their hair. In the most severe cases, shortness of breath can become so serious that you require continuous oxygen therapy.    Shortness of breath while lying down. People with more severe heart failure may experience shortness of breath when they lie down. The medical term for this symptom is orthopnea (or-THOP-nee-ah). The severity of this symptom usually depends on how flat you are lying—the flatter you lie, the more you feel short of breath.   To gauge the severity of this symptom, doctors often ask people how many pillows they need to lie on to avoid feeling short of breath in bed. For example, \\"three-pillow\\" orthopnea is worse than \\"two-pillow\\" orthopnea because you have less tolerance for lying flat.  The reason you may have orthopnea is that when you lie flat, the blood that ordinarily pools in the veins of your legs is reentering your bloodstream. If you have heart failure, your heart may not be able to keep up with the increased amount of blood returning to the heart, so fluid builds up inside the lungs and causes shortness of breath.  Shortness of breath while sleeping. Some people with heart failure wake up in the middle of the night with severe shortness of breath. The medical term for this symptom is paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND). In general, people who experience PND do not feel increased shortness of breath when they first lie down. However, after several hours of lying down, they awake with shortness of breath, which often occurs suddenly. People who experience PND often have to sit up on the side of the bed, and they may feel a need to open a window to get more air. The shortness of breath generally goes away after a few minutes of sitting up.    While shortness of breath is the most common symptom of heart failure, it may be difficult or impossible to distinguish it from shortness of breath caused by other health problems such as emphysema or severe anemia. Your doctor can help you determine why you have been feeling short of breath.   Based on the above, it might be a very good idea to go and be checked by a cardiologist to determine if your heart palpitations along with SOB or dyspnea with mild exertion are indeed due to  early signs of heart failure.  He'll most likely do an EKG and a cardiac stress testing  or treadmill test. even an Echocardiogram.   I have an extensive nsg experience work hx in taking care of cardiac patients.  And I also have asthma and a bad heart.  No, I don't think your symptoms are due to the more severe diagnosis of cardiomyopathy  (weakness of cardiac muscles) for which heart transplant is the only recourse.   I hope you find this thorough answer helpful.    Good Luck!!!"},{"Patient":"Im 23, and have high blood pressure (160/110 ish).

The heart flutters is called palpitations.  The term refers to the ability to feel you heart beating fast or irregularly.  It is common for many people and the causes vary.  Your other symptoms sound like they are anxiety related.  Someone else mentioned panic attacks which are definitely a possibility.  As for your symptoms occurring at night, it may also be happening during the day but you are unaware of it.  When we sit down and try to relax, we become more aware of our surroundings and what is going on with our bodies.  I strongly recommend seeing your family doctor.  He can better evaluate you as an individual and help determine the best treatment.  A low dose anti-depressant for a few months may do you some good.  You may say that you don't feel depressed, but there are many uses for these drugs.

Of course, I have already placed a call to her doctor but I was just curious if anyone has a similar problem. She is 5 6 and 120 pounds. She has asthma and takes meds for that but has not had these symptoms before. She has not changed her meds recently nor has she had any life changes. In the past she has complained once or twice of a sharp knifelike feeling in her heart but that only lasted for about 20 seconds. She sees her pediatrician and a pulmonologist/allergist! I have called both and will see what they have to say. She is an active normal teen with no history of heart problems. She has also started complaining of her vision being odd. She says her eyes have been watering a lot when she tries to focus on something! I appreciate any responses. She is curious if anyone else has these sensations. Thanks! Took her in to see her pediatrician and he listened to her heart and ran an EKG. Both were normal. He wants to give it a few days and if it continues he said we will have to take her to a cardiologist and she will have to wear a Holter Monitor for 24 hours. We still don t have any answers and it is still happening. Thanks for all of the answers!","Doctor":"The only thing for a cold sensation I can think of is acid reflux. When you get heart burn it feels crazy and can give anxiety (hence the rapid heart rate). You can remedy acid reflux (gerd, or heart burn, throat burn or whatever you want to call it) by getting some digestive enzymes (try something like Source Natural's Daily Digestive Enzymes) at a local vitamin store (or try vitacost.com) and it'll give her enough digestive juices to help grind up her food better. Also food intolerances will cause problems too. I discovered a food intolerance to wheat, milk and peanuts. But you have to write down how you feel after you eat something and try eliminating it for awhile and see how it goes. You can ask a doctor for an Elisa test (for food allergies) but it doesn't tell us much. A food elimination/rotation diet is much better plus it can't hurt.  A sharp knife like feeling is definitely heart burn from what I've felt or heard about.  Make sure you write down when these things occur, what time and how long (dates) and what she had to eat earlier. Pizza is a biggie on heart burn. Hot dogs, anything with bad fats in it. Bread if she is intolerant to wheat and so on.  I would throw in a thyroid (TSH) test for hyper or hypothyroidism. So many symptoms stem from those diseases (difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, digestion issuges and so on)...that it should be warranted just to rule it out.  And if it keeps happening see the doc. But sometimes I do believe we have to be our own detectives.

You can do tepid sponging of her whole body with lukewarm water using a wet towel (taking care not to expose her to cold) if her fever is very high tonight. In view of the fever with chills, I would advise blood tests to rule out Malaria and Dengue Fever. A low WBC count will be more in favour of flu. A high WBC count will mean bacterial or viral infection. A low platelet count can be due to Dengue. Other common causes of fever with chills are Urinary Tract Infections, Typhoid and viral infections (flu or regular, common viral infections). You may start a broad spectrum antibiotic and an anti-allergic under the supervision of your daughter's pediatrician, before the blood tests results. A cough mixture may also be added. Supervised steam inhalation will be beneficial. Nasal decongestants will help if her nose is severely blocked.

The majority of allergic reactions to dietary components are caused by a small number of foods, namely: * Cow’s milk * Hen’s eggs * Peanuts * Tree nuts * Soya beans * Soya products * Fish * Shellfish, prawns * Gluten containing cereals eg. Wheat * Citrus fruits In children, it has been estimated that nine out of ten reactions are to milk, soya, peanuts, tree nuts, or wheat gluten. Many of these reactions reduce after early childhood. A majority of allergic reactions in adults result from sensitisation to shellfish, fish, peanuts, and tree nuts. It is unusual for food allergy to begin in adulthood.","Doctor":"* Food intolerance reactions may vary the severity of the associated symptoms and the length of time for which they persist.  * For example peanut allergy is often life long and can cause severe, even life threatening reactions to tiny amounts of peanut protein.  * Cow’s milk intolerance may be severe in early life, but typically disappears as the child grows older.  * Similarly, egg intolerance is usually a temporary phenomenon associated with early childhood.  * Coeliac disease (gluten sensitivity) is normally life long and requires adherence to a diet that excludes all gluten. But in some people as the disease is mild and goes undiagnosed, the individual is not aware of any symptoms.

The blockage leads to increased pressure, impaired blood flow, and inflammation. If the blockage is not treated, gangrene and rupture (breaking or tearing) of the appendix can result. Most commonly, feces blocks the inside of the appendix. Also, bacterial or viral infections in the digestive tract can lead to swelling of lymph nodes, which squeeze the appendix and cause obstruction. This swelling of lymph nodes is known as lymphoid hyperplasia. Traumatic injury to the abdomen may lead to appendicitis in a small number of people. Genetics may be a factor in others. For example, appendicitis that runs in families may result from a genetic variant that predisposes a person to obstruction of the appendiceal lumen. [Top] Symptoms Symptoms of appendicitis may include * pain in the abdomen, first around the belly button, then moving to the lower right area * loss of appetite * nausea * vomiting * constipation or diarrhea * inability to pass gas * low fever that begins after other symptoms * abdominal swelling Not everyone with appendicitis has all the symptoms.

Second fact is disc herniation cannot be seen on X-ray but we can assume it if there is reduction in disc height. MRI is the needed investigation to confirm disc herniation. If there is repeat episode of acute onset back ache likely cause may be: 1. Acute lumbar sprain 2. Disc herniation with nerve compression. MRI of lumbo sacral spine with screening of whole spine needs to be done. Please get it done from radiology center nearby you. Meanwhile start tablet Ultracet P twice a day with tablet Pregalin one at bedtime. Strict bed rest on hard bed is required.

However, if I were your doctor I would like to know some things about that back pain since back pain can be produced by several causes. Back pain common causes are Lumbalgias due to simple muscular contractures, lumbosacral spine pathologies, high urinary tract infections, renal lithiasis and many times less probable colon pathologies. There are more causes but these are most common. Knowing this, I would do a physical exam to you first. Then, depending on what that physical examination suggests some paraclinical studies such as urine test, complete haematology, lumbosacral spine x-rays and renal echogram. It would be very important to know more about that pain and if there are some other concomitant symptoms. To treat that pain, we first need a clear diagnosis that a good physical examination will provide. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
