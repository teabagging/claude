Since, you have a 6 month old baby, i would also like to enquire whether it was a normal delivery or Caesarian section was required.Vaginal candidiasis (yeast) is a common condition. It can lead to severe irritation, itching and curdy white discharge. Local vaginal creams for candidiasis like Clotrimazole cream must be applied. It is also necessary to maintain hygiene and keep your private parts clean and dry.I would also advise you to go for Urine routine examination and culture, to rule out any other causes of Urinary Tract Infection. In that case oral course of antibiotics may be required (since you are lactating all classes of antibiotics cannot be used). If the problem is persistent, you should get a blood sugar profile checked and consult your gynaecologist regarding the same.Hope this helps you out."},{"Patient":"I am a 42 year old male in good physical health.  I haven't had any previous heart related issues.  My BP is 110/70 and my total cholesterol is 216 with HDL, LDL, and triglycerides all within acceptable range.  I was having some chest discomfort and shortness of breath so my primary physician suggested I do a cardio stress test. The treadmill test and EKG were both normal. However, the cardiologist said that my ejection fraction was at 45% and wanted to do a retest in 6 months. I am a little concerned and wondered how serious this low EF is?  Everything else was completely normal. The cardiologist didn't seem too concerned, but I am very worried. Could this EF number be the cause of my symptoms?  Should I do another cardio stress test and echocardiogram sooner?

Other examinations may be needed to find out the cause of this heart damage. Hope I have answered your query.

He advised to apply Ketovate Solution ( Ketoconazole solution) one hour before taking bath. In night , Kansel - ds lotion to be applied. This treatment is going on for last 2 months but there is no improvement. We have observed that it starts in summer and continues for 2 months. This gets cured within 2 months.

And she should also have one oral antifungal shot such as Fluconazole 400 mg single dose, which is more ideal treatment of the condition.So my opinion is that give her single tablet of fluconazole 400 mg single dose and ask her to apply oxyconazole or itraconazole cream twice a day & see the results. It may take 20 -30 days to resolve thsi type of infection.Once cured precautions should be taken so that they wont recure.

Considering your age diabetes is unlikely still my advice to you is that you must under go blood sugar level testing once.

It is not transferred by air born route & if proper hygienic precautions are taken.If the ring worm is confirmed only topical therapy ( local application ) will not be sufficient  & you should have to take oral anti fungal such as Terbinafine plus local anti fungal application such as itraconazole.

The causes of itching in said region may be fungal infection or the any worm infestation most common of which is round worm.Considering round worm infestation as you have already taken all worm tablet my advice would be wait for days or two as the clearing of worm may require few days after having tablets. If there is relief in few days  You should repeat the same tablet ( albendazole chewable Would be better choice ) after one week.If the itching is not relieved in a day or two you must consult a dermatologist he would prescribe you proper antifungal for oral as well as topical use."},{"Patient":"I'm a 23 year old male, 5'8, and weight 183 pounds.

The inflammatory bowel disease as a cause of it is necessary to be ruled out as this may lead to non-responding persistent abdominal upset.It is advisable to get your stool routine & microscopic examination done & have a consultation from proper gastroenterologist who may ask you to perform few tests such as colonoscopy if needed.The gnats & fruit flies may be the reason for the infection but the wont cause the blood in the stools usually, nor they are responsible for such a long course of abdominal upset.So my advice is that you must have to consult gastroenterologist for this problem."},{"Patient":"Repeated Widal test result of s typhi th 320 even after taking the following antibiotics; rocephin, augmentin, flagyl, ciprotab, each for 7 days with no change.

I have also undergone hysterectomy a year ago. so, could that be the cause?","Doctor":"Thank you for the query.I would like to know your age, whether you have any associated comorbidities like Diabetes Mellitus and also whether you are on a any Hormone replacement therapy (since you have undergone hysterectomy). Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) can arise due to a number of causes. Since you have undergone Hysterectomy, you are in a surgical post menopausal state. The vaginal area becomes dry in this situation and hence bacterial multiplication can lead to UTI. Hormone replacement therapy may have some protective effect (provided you don't have other contraindications)Diabetes mellitus (increased blood sugar) may lead to frequent UTI. Hence, it is advisable to get your blood sugar (Fasting and post prandial) checked, if you haven't got them tested yet.KUB USG may not always reveal stones, specially small ones (X-ray KUB may be more useful in this regard). I would also like to know whether the residual urinary volume (RUV) was done during your USG. Increased RUV may be a reason for recurrent UTI.I would advise you to drink plenty of fluid and maintain personal hygiene. Avoid using any type of pain-killers. If not done you can get a Urine culture done, which may reveal the organism responsible (so that you can take targeted antibiotics) and get your renal function test done. If there is any irregularity, you should contact your physician for further check up and advise.Hope this help you."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have a dull pain in my left back/chest just below the left shoulder blade, under the rib cage.

I have had this back/chest pain for roughly 6 months. Do you have any ideas what it is likely to be? Many thanks.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Limitation of the pain to swallowing is a strong sign to limit the reasons in the gastrointestinal tract. Generally, dysphagia or difficulty on swallowing is aggravated by cold liquids, but a family history of Barrett Esophagus can't be ruled out.Other causes are Achalasia, Gastro esophageal reflux and esophageal stricture. You have to perform an upper endoscopy to figure out the cause.Hope I have answered your query.

The virus infection may be the cause for the breathing difficulties but then it is usually accompanied y running nose, malaise & temperature etc .So in your case viral infection is not responsible for the symptoms.Considering history of your panic attacks & lack of the accompanying symptoms points the cause of the breathing difficulties towards psychological origin.My suggestion is to be relaxed, wipe out your feelings of breathing difficulties seek opinion of psychotherapist if needed."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, Myself Karthik............

As a former military doctor with lots of sweaty soldiers to look after I saw a lot of poor guys with tinea cruris and this is how I usually helped them:1. Wear only cotton boxer shorts (or go without underpants altogether to get the air flowing!)2. Don't overwash the area with harsh soaps - you are not dirty!3. Use a \\"triple cream\\" containing a moderately potent steroid, an antifungal and an antibiotic - these are prescription only, so you will need to ask your doctor about it.4. Use an antifungal \\"foot powder\\" (but don't use talc - it just turns into slime) - these can usually be bought over the counter.I think you will find that you can get through the summer in this way with minimal suffering - although there is no \\"cure\\" for this condition in the long term."},{"Patient":"The doctor performed a physical on me, and told me I have a UTI, but after finishing my medication 3 weeks later, it still hasn't gone away.

While it is unlikely that you may have infected yourself, you should certainly avoid such practices of other reasons:1. Biting nails is aesthetically unpleasant;2.

Anyway, I would recommend consulting with your attending physician for a careful physical exam and some tests to investigate for other possible causes: -  A resting ECG and cardiac ultrasound-  An ambulatory 24-48 hours of ECG monitoring to exclude possible cardiac arrhythmia-  Blood electrolytes-  Thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction-  Complete blood count for anemia-  A chest X-ray study and pulmonary function tests. If all these tests result normal, you should consider panic attacks as the main cause of your complaints. Hope I have answered your query.

For last 2 months she had throat infection twice and viral infection once.  Everytime she was advicd for antibiotics and meftal-P to reduce the infection and high temperture. Doctor even suggested to give Meftal-P (7.0ml) thrie  a day even there is no fever. How safe is meftal-P for repeated administation for childen","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HCM!I am sorry to hear about your daughters' condition.First of all, I want you not to worry about the recurrent infections in your child. It has become quite common these days due to weather changes. However, I'd request you to take proper precautions to prevent infections in your child.Meftal-P is a potent drug used to reduce fever in children. If fever doesn't come down, it may be given upto 4 times a day i.e 6 hourly.I hope that you gave her and completed the entire antibiotic course and didn't leave it in between. While bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics, nothing much can be done for viral infections. Viral infections are generally self limiting and are cured in 6-8 days. Only symptomatic treatment may be given to reduce fever and cold. To prevent recurrent infection, ensure your child is fed well with nutritious food. This will increase her immunity to fight against infections. Also, maintain hygienic conditions in your house with proper ventilation.Hope this information helps.Feel free to ask if you have any doubt.Wishing your daughter a speedy recovery.With warm regards,Dr. Sridhar Reddy"},{"Patient":"I have an old, long, abdominal scar that has recently become red and infected in part of it. When I realized it was infected I began to apply peroxide and neosporin twice daily keeping it covered. The infection has improved but is still there, it is still red, the wound is still open and after six weeks is now not improving. Any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HCM!Sorry to hear about your problem.Since your scar is infected, merely applying the lotion/powder on it won't suffice. You will have to take an oral antibiotic course. The wound may require closure again and hence, I'd suggest you to visit your treating doctor and get it sutured again. Also, it will need proper dressing.Also, I'd like you to get your blood sugar investigation done. A common cause of non-healing wounds and recurrent infection is Diabetes. Hence, it's bettr to rule it out.Hope this information helps.

Beta-lactams, including penicillins and cephalosporins (for example, Amoxicillin, Augmentin, Keflex, Duricef, Ceftin, Lorabid, Rocephin, Cephalexin, Suprax, and others).2. Aminoglycosides (for example, gentamycin, amikacin, and tobramycin) used usually in combination with other antibiotics to combat severe UTIs.You can help reduce the discomfort by taking the following steps:1. Follow your health-care provider's treatment recommendations.2. Finish all antibiotic medication even if you are feeling better before the medication is gone.3. Take a pain-relieving medication.4.

The reasons for itching in the groin area is most commonly due to fungal infections and contact irritation.

Avoid tight underwear and clothes. Local application of antifungal creams like clotrimazole twice daily for two weeks will help reduce the itching.

Dengue fever needs urgent investigations and treatment as it severely decreases the platelet counts in your body.Hence, I'd advice you to - 1. If residing in an endemic area for Dengue, immediately visit a doctor and get your dengue tests done.2. If minor symptoms, you may take an antipyretic and analgesic for symptomatic relief as it may likely be a viral fever.However if you feel worse in the coming days, you should immediately visit your doctor.Hope this has solved your query.

He was 69 years old and healthy as a horse. He was excercising with his friends one morning as any other (his routine was about a 10k walk, followed by swimming and weightlifting). He said he felt as though his back and face were being pricked repeatedly. They told him to sit down, and he collapsed within a matter of minutes. He was quite literally passing in front of the hospital, right in front of the emergency entrance. You can imagine that the ambulance arrived quite quickly, although the doctor I talked to said that he had probably passed in the ambulance. No doctors I have talked to have been able to give me a definite answer as for why his artery ruptured. He was not under stress, and heart problems haven't been...complicated. Apparently, it was somthing that he kept from my mother and I...something that many people live weith for years, and his heart specialist had said was currently not a problem...please, I wasn't even in the country when this happened. I want to fin out what happened.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Your father had a rapid progressive aortic dissection. This is like a terrible car crash where the chance to survive is very low, even if the patient is in the hospital. Aorta is the largest blood vessel arterial in the human body that takes blood from the heart to the peripheral organs. Aortic dissection can occur in a normal looking aorta or in an enlarged (dilated) one. High blood pressure and extreme physical activity may trigger the dissection. The dissection enlarges itself and the patient experience a very sharp pain. There are different types of aortic dissections and the chance to survive depends on that and the size of dissection.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards, Dr. Anila Skenderi"},{"Patient":"doctor my daughter is having fever but not continuously after four or five days for last three months. i shown her to our rural doctor and they given treatment for viral fever, Maleria , thpoid etc. but her fever which touch 101 degrre persit. all blood test and sonography have been done. she is 17 yrs old.","Doctor":"Dear Friend.Welcome to HCM.

For a usual viral fever, (common cold or sore throat etc), is takes about 3-5 days and it usually resolves on its own, unless severe or if bacterial.For such cases, mild antipyretics are sufficient along with a little dietary modification.

Puncture wound was infected within 3 days even though I saw a doctor w/in 1 hr. of bite and was taking oral antibiotics. A sinus tract developed and burst on top of knuckle at pointing finger.

From what I have researched, I believe I have developed chronic osteomyelitis and it is doing the now you see me, now you don t routine. Problem being is that I had no money or insurance for the med. care and the bite was received while working as a groomer. The dog owner paid for the 1st 3 doctor visits and the 2 scripts, but walked away when I was referred to an orthopedist. It was the ortho who pre-lim diagnosed septic arthritis and ordered the CAT scan. Due to the money issue, I had to retain an attorney so I could hopefully get med treatment. So, my appts. have been very wide spread and I have received no treatment.

Fever occurs due to your body's protective mechanism against the infection. You should start with antibiotics immediately and also ward saline gargles. Once you start antibiotics, the infection should subside in 5-6 days. If it doesn't , you may have to undergo furthur investigations. As far as tobacco chewing is concerned, tabacco is a cancer causing substance and the as such depends on a number of factors like the amount you consumed, the duration, the type.

Could what I'm experiencing be all anxiety related?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Let's get out the medical terms and speak as two friendsConcerning your heart symptoms which ruled out any serious condition that means you might live hard times with a relative or a friend who suffered greatly from heart diseases, or you might be touched by a story or whatever making you worry about your heart. A panic attack is just to fear from something and the symptoms are just like what you wrote, but treating it is easy. You have mentioned that you pass through hard social circumstances and that is enough to be worry and I agree with you, but let's keep moving forward. What about applying for new jobs? Traveling abroad? Trying something new? Making new friends? All of these can get you out of this condition.Let's speak medically, you seem to have an anxiety disorder which is very common to any normal person. In anxiety, Serotonin level decreases in your brain which makes you more susceptible to have panic attacks.How to increase our Serotonin level? there are three major nonmedical ways to increase your Serotonin level:1- Exercise on a regular basis.2- Sleeping well and early ( before 12 a.m. ) because the ideal time for your brain to synthesize serotonin is from 00:00 to 02:00 3- Happiness, do things you like and have fun with your friends, etcetera.There is, of course, a medical way to increase your serotonin by taking SSRI (Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors) which is prescribed by a psychiatrist. Also, Counselling has a major effect.My advice to you is to change your lifestyle and if this doesn't help you may ask for counseling with a psychiatrist.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,      Dr. Mario Aiad"},{"Patient":"can I use mupirocin ointment for ingrown hair infection or should I use nystatin and triamcinolone acetonide cream USP I did not know that I had to pay... I do not have the money or a credit card to pay I thought this was a public service .. stupid me","Doctor":"Mupirocine is better choice for any kind of bacterial infection rather than others. Though it is bit costly but the results with it are very good. So My opinion is to go with  it rather than using anything else. Nystatin is antifungal & triamcinolone is strroid which wont be benificial in bacterial infection. What is important here is the dergree of infection you are having if it is quit big wound then you have to start oral antibiotics too. The decision of starting oral antibiotics & anti-iflamatory agents can only be taken after having look at the infection site. But I will definitly suggest mupirocin which will be benificail."},{"Patient":"i hit my leg on a wagon bring it up from the basement took the fleash right off the leg and I now I belive I have infection in it .I cleaned it with dial soap then poured proxocide over it then applied neosporinon 4 bandages and coved it and have been doing this 2 xa day but it looks red arou nd the area should I be concerned?","Doctor":"The exact opinion regarding the same can not be given unless and until the wound is seen. But considering the points narreted by you, you doesnt seem to worry as you have already taken the proper care. My advice is that look for the symptoms such as fever & malise, or yellowish or greenish coloured discharge from wound, which in case ouccr would suggest the persistant infection. In that case you need to rush to doctor. well I would like to suugest you even though you have taken the proper care, adding oral antibiotics such as cifixime+dicloxacilline two times a day ( or similar ) & anti-inflamatory agent would hasten the recovery. & in place of neosporin I will sugest you the application of mupirocine which is the better choice. If you have not immunized to tetanus it is advisible to get Inj TT im single dose."},{"Patient":"Hi, I got bitten by a stray dog (not looking mad) .

As per the history provided by you, she is having high grade fever, alongwith chills and rigor, with some disorientation.With these symptoms, I would advise you to consult your doctor/paediatrician as soon as possible. Your daughter is suffering from some infection (viral or bacterial) and the source needs to be localised (respiratory tract, urinary tract etc.). Wet cloth application and tepid sponging may provide symptomatic relief, but an antipyretic like paracetamol needs to be given (dose to adjusted as per her age and weight)I would also advise you to get some blood investigations done like White blood cell count, Hb, ESR, electrolytes (sodium/potassium), C-reactive protein, which may give an idea about the type and severity of infection. If its a bacterial infection, antibiotics need to be started. Give your daughter plenty of fluid (she needs to be adequately hydrated during febrile episodes)But as I have told you consult your physician as soon as possible for further advise.Hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"I am having cold and cough regularly .

You haven't mentioned you age and gender though.Medications like Amoxycillin, Amoxycillin-Claveulenic acid (625 mg, thrice a day for 5-7 days) and Azithromycin (500mg once a day for 3/6 days) may help (better to take it after a physician examines you). Droxyl clav is composed of Cefadroxil-claveulenic acid which may also be taken. You can take Paracetamol for your fever. For your nasal congestion, a number of commercially available nasal decongestant may help. In the meantime you can continue the steam inhalation (which will moisten your airway).Since you a giving a history of frequent cough/cold/nasal congestion, I would advise you to go for  X-ray paranasal sinus, since sinusitis/pansinusitis can lead to these symptoms. Deviated nasal septum, may cause nasal congestion.It would be good if you can contact your doctor/ENT specialist, who can examine you thoroughly and give you the necessary medicines after clinical examination.

I would also like to know whether she has any comorbidities like Diabete mellitus, any symptoms of urinary tract infection (burning during urination, flank pain, increased frequency of urination etc) are present or not and whether she has any exposure to tuberculosis.If a patient is suffering from low grade fever which mainly occurs at night, 2 things need to be ruled out Tuberculosis and hematological disorder (specially if history of weight loss is also noted). In this context, I would advise you to get some blood investigations done like complete hemogram, Blood sugar, Liver function test and Chest X-ray.

I went to a GP, did bloodtests etc but couldn't find anything wrong.  Is it possible that it can be the contraceptions that affects my hormones?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.     What type of contraception are you using? Hormonal contractions affect your natural hormones but it is highly unlikely that contraception is the cause of your low blood pressure. If you are using oral contraceptive pills up to know they have not been reported to decrease blood pressure. Conversely, if the contraceptive pill contains both estrogen and progesterone (combined oral contraceptive pills) it may cause an increase in blood pressure because of containing estrogen. Progesterone-only pills which contain no estrogen have no effect on blood pressure. Your low blood pressure is highly likely caused by some other causes. Medications, dehydration, cardiovascular and nerve system disorders are the most common causes of low blood pressure. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,      Dr. Malik"},{"Patient":"Hello, I had unsafe sex about 18 days ago and started PEP treatment about 4 hours after probable exposure.

Continue the post exposure prophylaxis for 4 weeks.

I had my nose pierced around a month ago, and a small bump formed a few days ago. I've been using a salt water solution of half a mug full of boiling water mixed with half a tea spoon full of rock salts. My stud is made from titanium metal. Do I have to remove my stud as my skin is reacting to a foreign body? Can I leave my stud in? Apparently Flucloxacillin is good for this kind of thing - have I definitely got an infection? It bled yesterday but I've seen no sign of puss. Any advice on how to control this infection without worsening it? Thank you","Doctor":"Thank you for your query.There are two possibilities:1. Your body is allergic to titanium; hence it is causing a inflammatory reaction.2. The nose-stud was not sterile i.e. it had some bacteria already on it; hence the infection.In the first case, you need to replace the titanium stud with a relatively inert metal such as gold. In the second case, you need to apply an antiseptic cream such as neomycin at least twice daily till the wound heals.I suggest that you do both."},{"Patient":"I just recently had sex with my boyfriend I have herpes but we used a condom I just got over an outbreak there was little skin to skin contact on his thigh from where I had my outbreak at can I spread it by his thigh touching it but  he washed up and took a shower right afterwards is he at risk I know it takes 2-7 days for symptoms to show I really need some answers im scared for him!","Doctor":"Thankyou for your query.You have genital herpes, transmitted mainly by human herpes virus 2 (HHV-2).

You should approach a physician and get the Rabies shot without delay.As far as first-aid measures are concerned: wash your lips with lots of soap water. Do not -mind you, do not - suture (stitch) the wound as this will only allow the virus to reach the peripheral nerves faster.Of course, if the dog is not infected with rabies there is nothing to worry, but, then, it's always better to be safe than sorry."},{"Patient":"I have been experiencing multiple symptoms that I think could be related to abnormally low blood pressure.

She used to regularly take methyl prednisolon and Azathioprin tables in fixed doses as adjusted by specialists at Apollo Hospital in New Delhi. Also underwent an angioplasty of left coronaries in March 2012. Around 40 days ago she developed symptoms of sever respiratory infection and increased hypoxia, the medical doctors prescribed her braod spectrum anibiotic (ceftriaxon) to be taken with her routine drugs. However, her infection and hypoxia not treated and she found weakness in her lower part of her body and became unable to walk. Following this we transfered her from My country (Afghanistan) to Apollo Hospital in India on 20 Nov 2012. In the hospital she was admitted at ICU ward and received the treatment for infection, hypoxia and swelling in her legs and hands. she recovered after some five days and she was about to be shifted to general ward, but the medical doctors requested her further stay at ICR. Following this she got another sever infection (called Aseno Bacter). Then her health condition worsened, although she received new courses of antibiotics. Last night she got sever respiratory distress and then the doctors did intubation of her, now she is under intubation. Could you please kindly let me on the prognosis of this level of treatment and how long it may take that she may need intubation?","Doctor":"The condition of the patient is of course serious. About intubation which is life supportive measure that must have been done because of the life theratening hypoxia. As the patient is known case of ILD ( interstitial lung disease) which  itself reduces the diffusion capacity of lung with resultant hypoxia, & the super added infection whcih further deteriorates lung diffusion capacity worsens the situation. The decision of the extubation ( removing the endotracheal intubation tube ) can only be taken considering multiple parameters such as patients conciousness, her capacity of maintaining Oxygen saturation ( SPO2) , readings of the ABG ( arterial blood gas reports), whcih is some what difficult & cumbersome process to make you understand. Considering the symptoms provided by you there are 50 - 50 % chances of recovery as wella s deterioration.

Every time I remove the worms there are two worms guarding the sores.  They place more worms in the sores as fast as I remove them.  This is the third stage of these worms.  Everytime it is different. This started when I found little black paraticles in my carpet. They got on my skin and immediately got into my blood.  They slide into my skin like you would not believe.  Every time now when the sores open and bleed many many eggs come out of the sores and get on my body causing them to be more and more sores.  Sometimes these parasites will close the sores with who know who's skin and they will heal but these places are very sore.

My son is 14 months old and tonight I noticed a measles-like rash on his trunk. He may have had a low grade fever a earlier this week but I never checked him since he was sweaty at times but playing happily and otherwise fine. He is getting his molars and has had his fingers in his mouth a lot, which I assumed was due to teething discomfort. Currently, he has no fever. Apparently, when I was a child, I had the measles with no fever or symptoms other than the rash. Is it possible that my son has the measles in the same way that I did as a child? What do you recommend I do?","Doctor":"Hi!I read carefully your query.The typical case of measles actually starts with a fever, runny nose, hacking cough, and red eyes. After two to four days of these symptoms, the patient may develop spots within the mouth called Koplik's spots. These spots look like little grains of white sand surrounded by a red ring and are usually found inside the cheek toward the back of the mouth (opposite the first and second upper molars).The skin rash (also known as an exanthem or exanthema) appears three to five days after the onset of the initial symptoms (fever, cough, runny nose, and red eyes). The rash is a flat to slightly raised (maculopapular) red rash that usually last five to six days. It begins at the hairline and then progresses to the face and upper neck. Over the next two to three days, the rash progresses downward to cover the entire body, including the hands and feet. The rash has mostly distinct lesions, but some may overlap (become confluent). Initially, these lesions will turn white when you press on them (blanch). After three to four days, they no longer will blanch. As the rash begins to fade, there will often be a fine flaking of the skin (desquamation). The rash fades in the same order that it appears.The fever that occurs with measles is called a stepwise fever. The patient starts with a mild fever that progressively gets higher. Fevers often reach temperatures greater than 103 F (39.4 )If you notice this symptoms to your son you should seek medical attention.Hope it was helpful to you.Wish a good health to your son.Dr.Rovena"},{"Patient":"Hello, I am so frustrated with a staff infection I have in my leg.

Boil is an infection of the hair follicle. They are common in the areas where there is increased hair and sweating. Occurs because of decreased aeration in the region. Deep shaving also causes this.

A wide variety of factors may cause heart palpitation. Certain medications, excessive exercise, stress or medical conditions (heart problems, endocrine diseases) may trigger heart palpitations.If the episode of palpitation is a few seconds to a few minutes duration without any other symptoms, then it does not need medical attention. But your heart palpitation is longer in duration and accompanying with dizziness which requires emergent medical evaluation.For the diagnosis purpose, your doctor may prescribe an Electrocardiogram (ECG), and/or continuous heart monitoring (Holter monitoring). The treatment is based on the underlying cause of the disorder. Please, contact your Doctor or visit ER for medical evaluation of your condition urgently.Hope I have answered your query.

I probaly drank too much (about 40 units per week).  I stopped drinking and have lost a lot of weight and my blood pressure is now low - my medication has been halved.  Could this all be as a result of not consuming alcohol?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Yes, limiting alcohol has its effect to decrease High blood pressure (BP). In your case, it is a highly likely a combination of abstinence from alcohol and weight loss has to lead to lower blood pressure values.Non-pharmacologic treatments of high BP includes weight loss, diet, exercise, dietary salt reduction, limiting alcohol, and have variable effect in blood pressure reduction. Every 10 kg weight loss decreases BP up 20 mm Hg and limiting alcohol decreases BP up to 5 mm Hg.Therefore, every patient with high BP should follow non-pharmacologic treatment along with pharmacologic treatment.Hope I have answered your query.

It also depends which part of the body the biopsy was taken.   If it is an area that is rubbing or receives a lot of pressure it will be slow to heal. There are medicines (ex:prednisone, cancer meds etc..), systemic disease(Ex:Diabetes), poor circulation, as well as smokers that are slower to heal.

I had severe head pressure, inability to move my head it hurt so bad, a stiff neck , a low-grade fever, sensitivity to light, and was overall feeling very yucky. My doctor thought it was viral meningitis until the monospot came back positive. My CBC also came back with a low white blood cell count. After recovering from the severe symptoms, I started seeing ghost images / double vision , and was having migraines. My doctor ordered an MRI, which revealed two 4mm lesions. One was on the right side of my basal ganglia , the other was on another section that the radiologist failed to mention entirely and the neurologist didn t say. He gave me migraine medication, which helped with the migraines for a little while. I also have had a chronic low-grade fever that I haven t been able to get rid of. I went to the doctor, and it was a throat infection causing it (he said), and he gave me antibiotics and said the fever should go away. It hasn t since then, and they are now accompanied with burning sensations deep inside my head. The vision has also gotten worse at times, along with having dull headaches to migraines everyday. Are these symptoms still of mono? Or is this something else I need to be concerned of. I see an eye doctor this Friday, and have a follow up with my neurologist in a week. I also see my primary care doctor tomorrow for a test. Are there any questions I should ask or anything I should tell any of them?","Doctor":"Hi,i don't think these are symptoms of mono as its a self limiting viral disease which subsides within 2 weeks or so. Also most probably you would have got rashes once you took antibiotics for seemingly sore throat but this doesn't rule out its probability totally! as medicine is a science of exceptions and variations have been seen often. The only way is to do test which may again come negative if assuming this is your second infection or superinfection by cytomegalovirus and not by EBV!I THINK U SHOULD BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LESIONS IN YOUR BRAIN WHICH CAN EXPLAIN MOST OF YOUR SYMPTOMS EXCEPT SORE THROAT(ASSUMING YOUR DOCTOR WAS RIGHT). see the neurologist as soon as possible and forget Mono because its a self limiting disease which is VERY UNLIKELY HERE. best of luck!"},{"Patient":"I was diagnosed with ebv 22 mths ago.

In addition, phrenic nerve paresis may cause such a clinical pattern.Coming to this point, a comprehensive clinical investigation including several imagine studies may be necessary (chest CT scan, abdominal ultrasound, MRI, etcetera.)A clinical and laboratory correlation is required to review possible inflammatory or systemic events in the past.Several lab tests are recommended:- Complete Blood Count- PCR & ESR- Liver & renal function tests- Blood electrolytes level, etceteraIn case you had a CT scan two years ago and no records of suspected health problems have come after, probably anew CT scan would not offer additional clinical information.Nevertheless, you need to discuss with your attending doctor on the above mentioned issues.Hope I have answered your query.

Oral antibiotics generally clear up infected corns, but pus may have to be drained through a small incision.Moisturising creams may help soften the skin.Oral NSAIDs will help you to reduce the pain.I would suggest you to consult your orthopaedician to confirm whether it is corn or callus and then he will decide the mode of treatment.Thank you."},{"Patient":"Hi, my Name is Kalindi, I am living in Switzerland and was in India in octobre 2013 with my daughter 12 years old. she got the lamblia giardia there and after two Treatments with antibiothicas she still has them.

The yellow color discharge indicates that there is a infection. Most common infection following a cut in a skin is either staph or strep infection, as these organism reside on the surface of the skin and when there is breach in the surface they will gain entry and produce the symptoms of discharge and pain.I would suggest you to tskr course of oral antibiotics like tab augmentin, twice daily for 5 days along with that local application of cream like T-Bact, these medications will help to reduce the symptoms.

Every virus needs nutrients and a congenial environment for sustenance and propagation. A bleached raccoon bone more than 3 years old, is highly unlikely to be contaminated with live viruses, which thrive only in the body tissues.

They said my white blood cell count was low.. im worried its not mono.","Doctor":"Hi there, Thanks for your query. The severity of symptoms depend on the body's immunity status and virility of the infecting virus. Hence, your symptoms are minimal. Further, the diagnosis of mono has been confirmed. As such, mono tends to cause a transient lowering of white blood cell count, which reverts back to normal once the infection is cured. So, I don't feel that there is any reason to be worried.

Its a 30 minute drive to nearest emergency but am not the type to go unless necessary. my question are what are symptoms for this to make sure. I have been fighting a cold for the 1st time in over a year...thank you","Doctor":"Hi there, Thanks for your query. It is highly unlikely that strep infection was the primary cause of recurrent skin lesion on the foot since teenage. Eczema or allergic lesions (due to contact with an allergen such as synthetic socks, stockings or shoes or environmental allergens), which disrupts the skin, enables bacteria to enter and cause bacterial infection. Other cause can be gout, which too can present in the similar manner. In any case, you need to consult a dermatologist who will examine the foot lesion, reach to the exact cause and prescribe appropriate treatment. in the meanwhile, you may use an ointment containing an antibiotic + a steroid for at least 2 weeks (or more- till the lesion disappears completely), which will take care of lesion, irrespective of the cause. Consult your doctor and apprise him of my opinion. I am certain that he will agree with me and will prescribe the advised drugs in appropriate doses.

And this fall I had blood drawn for SED, thyroid, cholesterol, and the nurses usually do a good job. A good job as in the only thing I see after I pull off the band-aid is the little red dot of where they stuck in the needle. And I have smaller veins so the doctor's office I usually go to has the nurses already aware to always use a smaller needle when they go to draw my blood. Plus, they always give my arm time before injecting a needle to allow a proper vein show up.  They do this by slapping my arm, using the elastic band, or whatever.      Yet come this past week since i'm a college student I live on campus, and  I got sick with an ear infection slash small stomach virus. And I could not go home to my normal doctor due to having to many things due this past weekend, so I decided to use the clinic on campus that is for students. And they end up having trouble diagnosing me because I had a low grade fever, yet I had drainage in my left ear. So they decided to do blood count test or sed rate.      Like I mentioned I never have problems after getting blood work done. But this time being nervous in a different doctor's office then I’m used to I notice the nurse was not taking her time at all making sure I had a proper vein. Yes she did use the elastic bandage, and I told her I had smaller veins. Yet she did not really check as much as most nurses I have had in past tend to do. And when she went to inject the needle I noticed that she did not inject it in the normal area under my elbow that I usually get blood drawn from and she did to the side of it.  I was slightly excited at the time, because I never had my blood drawn that fast. Yet it left me with a feeling of dread.      And that dread was right, after hours of having the cotton swab and Band-Aid on the injection sight, I lifted it up to see redness and two bruises on and around the sight. They were different in size, one about the size quarter and one about the size of a half dollar. And I showed one of my best friends, but she paid no mind to it thought it was normal. But over the weekend I developed another bruised around a nickel size near the other two bruises. Plus, I notice pain and painful lump had developed (probably a hematoma) between the size of a quarter to a half dollar's circumference 1 ½ inch to 2 inches away from the injection site. And now the redness has gone away but the bruises are still there, and so is the lump that is making it painful to bend my left arm. So what could have happened to cause this? And what can I do to make it less painful and to heal? I saw posts about taking vitamin c and applying compresses to it. But seriously, I never had this happen before and usually the only thing after blood work is the little red dot from injection nothing else.","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HCM.I understand your concern regarding redness and swelling in the area where the needle was pierced. Such swelling usually occurs due to thrombophlebitis due to bleeding and inflammation of the vein wall. It is one of the common complications of blood sampling.

Normally sella is occupied by pituitary gland. The \\"empty sella\\" is often discovered incidentally in people with no symptoms. . Sometimes hormonal problems, but usually not.

Some common symptoms associated with empty sella are headache, visual field defects, nontraumatic cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea and pituitary hormone abnormalities.

I am going through infertility treatment right now and was stimulated with Letrozole 7.5 from day 3-7 and then Gonal-F injections 100 units a day for four days, when I came for the ultrasound our IUI cycle was cancelled due to too many follicles, more then 19. I was not triggered with HCG shot. And I was given a birth control for 21 day without an explanation of why I need to drink it. Obviously we will abstain from intercourse to avoid pregnancy. But what is the purpose of birth control? Are doctors just protecting us from getting pregnant or is there some other reason for drinking birth control. I dont do too well on any birth control pills and I feel like i have too many hormones in my body right now. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello, Follicle growth & development is monitored during fertility treatment. When the follicles have reached 18-20 mm in diameter they are ready. A hormone trigger injection is given to stimulate your follicles to release the matured eggs prepared. The best possible time is estimated for IUI or matured eggs are collected to be fertilized with sperms to create embryos in the labs. When, as in your case the ovaries were sensitive & produced an unusually large number of follicles after stimulation. You were probably at the risk of OHSS, ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome. This is a dangerous condition so your treating doctor will take options to abandon the cycle or delay to stimulate follicles to release eggs. Since this is not the right time to conceive you were given birth control pills. It's good if you & your partner can abstain from sex. OHSS is a condition when the ovaries get swollen & painful. May complicate to shortness of breath, decreased urination, blood clots in the legs or a tight or enlarged abdomen. Sometimes, it may be fatal. Have patience, relax. Stay away from anxiety & addictions if any. Give your system time to return to normal. Visit your treating doctor thereafter & allow the treatment to continue. Hope I have answered your query.

I take Lisinopril, diltiazem and Xarelto. I also supplement these with Magnesium (250mg) which seems to help reduce my blood pressure a little more. My last blood test showed that my potassium and calcium levels were normal. I recently pinched a muscle in my back and was taking steroids, methylpred dosepak. The first day on this my blood pressure jumped to over 170 so I discontinued using them. A few days later, although my blood pressure was not unusually high, my blood pressure monitor showed that my pulse had jumped to 104. The next reading it was 109. Both readings showed an irregular heartbeat. After that it went back under 100 but the irregular heartbeat continued. I checked it at work where they have a medical center and my blood pressure was 134/78 and heart rate was 85. She didn t have the equipment to check the irregular heartbeat but said through my pulse she could detect it and said it was regularly irregular . However, later readings at home showed my blood pressure dropping under 100 with the lowest being 94/64. Pulse rate stayed under 100 but the irregular heartbeat continued. When I was finally able to reach my cardiologist, he thought that it was more likely a PIV because of the regularly irregular pulse and advised me to keep track and if my readings were over 100 consistently for 3-4 readings, let him know. After talking to him, the irregular heartbeat seemed to have gone away. Last night and today however, while my blood pressure seems to stay within range my pulse has been up and down.

Please suggest are these positive symptoms of expectation or need to get checked.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Clofert is a medicine that is given to promote development of follicles to a mature state and ovulation to occur. It usually takes 3-6 months for the action to take place. Ovulation is expected to occur once the follicles (little fluid filled sacs within which eggs develop in the ovary), reach a size of 18 - 36 mm. In your report there is a suggestion that the follicle reached the size of 21 mm, which is good. Fluid in the Pouch of Douglas (Pod) is also suggestive that ovulation might have occurred. This usually results in release of fluids along with the egg from the follicle. That the corpus lute was seen and reported also supports that ovulation (egg release) occurred. The thickness of lining of the womb (et) usually increases under the influence of progesterone. It is expected to reach up to 16 mm towards the end of menstrual cycle. Having a sufficiently thick endometrium supports the seating or nidation of a fertilises egg and its growth as a healthy, viable pregnancy. Your doctor advised Susten, which is progesterone, to develop this thickness which was shown to be just under at 10-11 mm. An increased vaginal discharge - as long as there is no symptom of infection should be normal. Since you are reporting itching as well, it might be worth getting yourself checked with your doctor for infection.All in all the report is satisfactory. Wish you all the best for ongoing treatment.

Letrozole with injections of hMG and FSH with follicular monitoring will help in regulating your follicles. You should stop worrying about ectopic pregnancy, we need to deal with that later. Its a fact that unhealthy follicle also result into ectopic pregnancy. Since you said there were no follicles in your previous induced cycle you will definitely need FSH stimulation early in the cycle from day 6-7. Hope I have answered your query.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. As the research is stating, progressive motility is becoming one of the most important factor in achieving successful pregnancy. Certain co-enzymes and antioxidants ( available in tablet and capsule form) help in increasing sperm quality but still most important factor remains lifestyle. I would suggest weight reduction and exercise . Increase fruit content and reduce on carbohydrates. Avoid wearing tight dresses and resume to age old loose undergarments (reduces temperature and increases sperm quality).

Having back pain and pimples are not the indicative signs of negative result following IVF procedure. Some of them do experience back pain following IVF procedure. You need to take supportive measures like hot fomentation and local application of pain relief gel to overcome it. Pimples could happen as hormonal preparation like extra progesterone would be supplemented in the form of injection or tablets, as it is necessary to sustain and continue pregnancy following implantation. Pimples would gradually supply after few months as the dose of hormone preparation would decrease as the pregnancy progresses following a positive result.

My question is can I become pregnant after taking these tablets this month please suggest me Dr","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Ovaa Shield tablet contains Clomiphene along with Acetyl Cysteine and Astaxanthin. Clomiphene helps with development of egg and its release from the ovary. Often it takes 3-6 months of treatment on Clomiphene, for pregnancy to happen that is if there is a regular intercourse with partner. However, not all cases may be suitable for Clomiphene. It is usually prescribed after detailed investigations of both partners for an underlying cause of infertility. Usually these investigations (blood tests, ultrasound, semen analysis, diagnostic laparoscopy and dye test) are started after 12-18 months of regular, unprotected sex. In your case, it is difficult to understand the rationale for starting Clomiphene after three months of marriage. Besides bear in mind that while we can prescribe and take medications - that a pregnancy will occur is a chance event.  At best a young (21 - 31 years) and healthy woman at the peak of her fertility has 1 in 5 chance of becoming pregnant in any one monthly cycle. So there is a case for being patient about the results. I would ask you in the meantime to discuss with your partner and the doctor about the way forward. It would be alright to wait on investigations for at least 12-18 months after marriage and use this time to enjoy marriage and develop the relationship with your spouse.

What is effect of these tabs on E2 or Endometrium thick?","Doctor":"Hello,The polycystic ovaries (PCO) that you have reported for your ovaries is a common condition affecting a third of women in the fertile age group. A number of hormone imbalances occur that affect the regularity of menstrual cycles and fertility of women. Women with PCO often have a resistance to insulin and it is where Glycomet is expected to help. The imbalance in female hormones means that although eggs develop in the ovaries, they are not releases and show up as fluid-filled cyst spaces in ovaries - hence the name 'polycystic ovaries'. Siphon 100 helps with the ovulation to occur in these women, that is the egg is released, thus improving the chance of becoming pregnant. It can help correct the thickness of endometrial lining as well by improving the hormonal imbalance that occurs when the ovum is not released. Folinal Plus is to support the pregnancy to grow satisfactorily as it provides Folic acid, which is one of the vital substance required for active cell division that ensues once conception occurs.Hope I have answered your query.

But then all-male medications are to be used for three months because that’s the time taken for production of sperms.

It is important for you to understand that at the peak of her fertility, any healthy woman around thirty years of age has approximately 1 in 5 to 6 chance of becoming pregnant during the fertile period of her cycle. This chance may become less due to a number of factors - increasing age, timing, and frequency of intercourse etcetera. In your case, the fact that you are not staying with your husband regularly and he is based abroad reduces your chance of becoming pregnant. Besides your marriage is very recent. A guiding principle for starting to investigate for sub-fertility is when a woman has not conceived for twelve months of having regular sex with her partner. This criterion has not been met in your case. However, given your health concerns - diagnosis of horseshoe kidney and PCO, it is important to start an investigation and plan for the conception. Horseshoe kidney is a condition that is there from birth and can occur together with malformations and problems linked to the reproductive parts. It may be worth getting imaging done for the kidneys, ureters, bladders as well as for the uterus, tubes and varied. The blood tests for a renal function should be done and review of results with a Urologist or Gynaecologist may be useful. Please get your blood pressure checked as sometimes this can occur with this condition.PCO or polycystic ovaries is a condition that is common, occurring in one out of three women. Sometimes it resolves with correction of weight, lifestyle changes, Sometimes medications may be necessary. Giving combined pills for 3-6 months is sometimes offered to manage irregular periods if fertility is not much of a concern. Doulton is a contraceptive pill, so it might not be the preferred method in your case. Clomid and Duphaston might be a better alternative, however, the intercourse has to be properly consummated, timed to the fertile period of your cycle and occur every two days to maximize the chances of conception.I would like to emphasize that for any investigation and management to deal with conception and pregnancy, it is important to include and involve the partner as well.Hope I have answered your query.
