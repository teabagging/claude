Understanding the Problem:   We are given seven points in the plane, and we need to connect some of them with segments such that:   - Among any three points, at least two are connected by a segment.   - The number of segments is minimal.2. Applying Turán's Theorem:   Turán's Theorem helps us find the maximum number of edges in a graph that does not contain a complete subgraph ( K_r ). For our problem, we need to ensure that among any three points, at least two are connected, which implies that the graph should not contain an independent set of three points.3. Graph Analysis:   Let ( G ) be a graph with 7 vertices (points) and ( varepsilon ) edges (segments). We need to ensure that ( G ) satisfies the given conditions. According to Turán's Theorem, the maximum number of edges in a graph with 7 vertices that does not contain a ( K_3 ) (triangle) is given by:   [   varepsilon' leq leftlfloor frac{7^2}{4} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{49}{4} rightrfloor = 12   ]   This means that the complement graph ( G' ) (where edges in ( G ) are non-edges in ( G' )) can have at most 12 edges.4. Finding the Minimum Number of Segments:   The total number of possible edges in a complete graph ( K_7 ) with 7 vertices is:   [   binom{7}{2} = 21   ]   Since ( G' ) can have at most 12 edges, the minimum number of edges in ( G ) is:   [   varepsilon = 21 - 12 = 9   ]5. Constructing the Minimal Configuration:   To achieve the minimal configuration, we can consider the union of a complete graph ( K_3 ) and a complete graph ( K_4 ). This configuration ensures that among any three points, at least two are connected, and it uses the minimal number of segments.   - ( K_3 ) has 3 vertices and 3 edges.   - ( K_4 ) has 4 vertices and 6 edges.   - Together, they form a graph with 7 vertices and ( 3 + 6 = 9 ) edges.Therefore, the minimal configuration satisfying the given conditions has 9 segments.The final answer is (boxed{9})"},{"problem":"46.

Therefore, (d = 0).2. Identify the largest digit and its replacement:   - Since (d = 0), the largest digit among (a, b, c) must be replaced by 1.   - Let (a, b, c) be the remaining digits, and one of them must be the largest digit.3. Ensure the resulting number is divisible by 3:   - A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.   - Let the original number be (overline{abc0}). The sum of its digits is (a + b + c + 0 = a + b + c).   - After replacing the largest digit with 1, the sum of the digits becomes (1 + k + m + 0 = 1 + k + m), where (k) and (m) are the other two digits.4. Set up the congruence condition:   - For the new number to be divisible by 3, (1 + k + m equiv 0 pmod{3}).   - This implies (k + m equiv 2 pmod{3}).5. Find all pairs ((k, m)) that satisfy (k + m equiv 2 pmod{3}):   - The possible pairs ((k, m)) are: ((8, 4), (7, 5), (6, 2), (5, 7), (4, 8), (3, 2), (2, 6), (1, 1)).   - Note that digits must be distinct, so pairs like ((1, 1)) are not valid.6.

Calculate the number of permutations:   - For each valid pair, there are 3!

Answer: 2501First we note that if sqrt{n-100}+sqrt{n+100} is a rational number, then both sqrt{n-100} and sqrt{n+100} are rational. Since n is a positive integer, this implies that sqrt{n-100} and sqrt{n+100} are integers. Let sqrt{n-100}=k and sqrt{n+100}=ell. Squaring both sides of the equations, we obtain n-100=k^{2} and n+100=ell^{2}.

We rule out ell-k=1 since it leads to ell and k being non-integers from equation (1). Thus we have ell-k=2, and it follows from equation (1) that ell+k=100.

Let ( A, C, D, B ) be four consecutive points on the segment ( AB ) with ( AC = a ), ( CD = b ), and ( DB = c ). Since ( AB ) is of unit length, we have:   [   a + b + c = 1   ]2. The product of the lengths of the six distinct segments with endpoints in the set ({A, B, C, D}) is given by:   [   P = AC cdot AD cdot AB cdot CD cdot CB cdot DB   ]   Substituting the lengths, we get:   [   P = a cdot (a + b) cdot 1 cdot b cdot (b + c) cdot c = abc(a + b)(b + c)   ]3.

The monotonicity of composite functions follows the principle of \\"same increase, opposite decrease\\". The key is to consider the domain of the function. This is a moderately difficult problem.Analysis:First, we need to determine the domain of the function f(x) = log_{frac{1}{2}}(x^2 - 2x - 3). Since the argument of a logarithmic function must be greater than zero, we have:x^2 - 2x - 3 > 0Solving this inequality gives the domain of f(x) as (-infty, -1) cup (3, infty).Next, let t = x^2 - 2x - 3. Then, f(t) = log_{frac{1}{2}}(t) is a decreasing function, because the base of the logarithm is less than 1.Now, let's consider the monotonicity of t = x^2 - 2x - 3. This is a quadratic function with a positive leading coefficient, so it is a parabola that opens upwards. The vertex of this parabola is at x = -frac{b}{2a} = 1, and since x = 1 is not in the domain of f(x), we only need to consider the monotonicity of t on the interval (-infty, -1).On the interval (-infty, -1), t = x^2 - 2x - 3 is a decreasing function. Therefore, the composite function f(t) = log_{frac{1}{2}}(t) is an increasing function on this interval.

Since ( P ) and ( Q ) lie on the parabola ( y = x^2 - x - 2 ), we have:   [   y_1 = x_1^2 - x_1 - 2 quad text{and} quad y_2 = x_2^2 - x_2 - 2   ]6. Substituting ( x_1 = -2x_2 ) into the equation for ( y_1 ):   [   y_1 = (-2x_2)^2 - (-2x_2) - 2 = 4x_2^2 + 2x_2 - 2   ]7.

Simplifying, we get:   [   2x_2^2 - 2x_2 - 4 + 4x_2^2 + 2x_2 - 2 = 0 implies 6x_2^2 - 6 = 0 implies x_2^2 = 1 implies x_2 = pm 1   ]9. Therefore, the coordinates of ( P ) and ( Q ) are ( (-2, (-2)^2 - (-2) - 2) ) and ( (1, 1^2 - 1 - 2) ).10.

The general question is the following. Call a polynomial fleft(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n}right) with integer coefficients nice, if f(0,0, ldots, 0)=0 and fleft(x_{pi_{1}}, ldots, x_{pi_{n}}right)=fleft(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n}right) for any permutation pi of 1, ldots, n (in other words, f is symmetric and its constant term is zero.) Denote by mathcal{I} the set of polynomials of the formp_{1} q_{1}+p_{2} q_{2}+ldots+p_{m} q_{m},where m is an integer, q_{1}, ldots, q_{m} are polynomials with integer coefficients, and p_{1}, ldots, p_{m} are nice polynomials. Find the least N for which any monomial of degree at least N belongs to mathcal{I}.The answer is n(n-1) / 2+1. The lower bound follows from the following claim: the polynomialFleft(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n}right)=x_{2} x_{3}^{2} x_{4}^{3} cdot ldots cdot x_{n}^{n-1}does not belong to mathcal{I}.Assume that F=sum p_{i} q_{i}, according to (2). By taking only the monomials of degree n(n-1) / 2, we can additionally assume that every p_{i} and every q_{i} is homogeneous, operatorname{deg} p_{i}>0, and operatorname{deg} p_{i}+operatorname{deg} q_{i}= operatorname{deg} F=n(n-1) / 2 for all i.Consider the alternating sumsum_{pi} operatorname{sign}(pi) Fleft(x_{pi_{1}}, ldots, x_{pi_{n}}right)=sum_{i=1}^{m} p_{i} sum_{pi} operatorname{sign}(pi) q_{i}left(x_{pi_{1}}, ldots, x_{pi_{n}}right):=S,where the summation is done over all permutations pi of 1, ldots n, and operatorname{sign}(pi) denotes the sign of the permutation pi. Since operatorname{deg} q_{i}=n(n-1) / 2-operatorname{deg} p_{i}1 and that the proposition is proved for smaller values of n.We proceed by an internal induction on S:=left|left{i: c_{1}=0right}right|. In the base case S=0 the monomial h is divisible by the nice polynomial x_{1} cdots x_{n}, therefore h in mathcal{I}. Now assume that S>0 and that the claim holds for smaller values of S. Let T=n-S. We may assume that c_{T+1}=ldots=c_{n}=0 and h=x_{1} cdot ldots cdot x_{T} gleft(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n-1}right), where operatorname{deg} g=n(n-1) / 2-T+1 geqslant(n-1)(n-2) / 2+1. Using the outer induction hypothesis we represent g as p_{1} q_{1}+ldots+p_{m} q_{m}, where p_{i}left(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n-1}right) are nice polynomials in n-1 variables. There exist nice homogeneous polynomials P_{1}left(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n}right) such that P_{i}left(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n-1}, 0right)=p_{i}left(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n-1}right). In other words, Delta_{i}:=p_{i}left(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n-1}right)-P_{i}left(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n-1}, x_{n}right) is divisible by x_{n}, let Delta_{i}=x_{n} g_{i}. We geth=x_{1} ldots ldots x_{T} sum p_{i} q_{i}=x_{1} ldots ldots x_{T} sumleft(P_{1}+x_{n} g_{i}right) q_{i}=left(x_{1} ldots ldots x_{T} x_{n}right) sum g_{1} q_{i}+sum P_{i} q_{i} in mathcal{I} .The first term belongs to mathcal{I} by the inner induction hypothesis. This completes both inductions.Comment 2. The solutions above work smoothly for the versions of the original problem and its extensions to the case of n variables, where all polynomials are assumed to have real coefficients. In the version with integer coefficients, the argument showing that x^{2} y notin mathcal{B} can be simplified: it is not hard to show that in every polynomial f in mathcal{B}, the sum of the coefficients of x^{2} y, x^{2} z, y^{2} x, y^{2} z, z^{2} x and z^{2} y is even.

By the Complex Conjugate Root Theorem, if ( z = a + bi ) is a root, then its complex conjugate ( overline{z} = a - bi ) is also a root. Since the polynomial is cubic, the third root must be real. Let the third root be ( c ).4. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of the polynomial ( P(x) ) is equal to the negation of the coefficient of ( x^2 ), which is (-1).

The player who places the last coin wins the game.What is the least number of squares Andile needs to declare as forbidden at the beginning to ensure a win? (Assume that both players use an optimal strategy.)","solution":"1. Initial Setup and Strategy:   - Andile and Zandre play on a (2017 times 2017) board.   - Andile declares some squares as forbidden.   - Zandre places the first coin, and they alternate turns.   - Coins cannot be placed on forbidden squares or in the same row or column as another coin.   - The player who places the last coin wins.2. Optimal Strategy for Andile:   - To ensure a win, Andile needs to declare a certain number of squares as forbidden.   - The goal is to minimize the number of forbidden squares while ensuring Andile's victory.3. Declaring an Entire Row Forbidden:   - If Andile declares an entire row forbidden, there are (2016) rows and (2017) columns left.   - Each move reduces the number of available rows and columns by 1.   - Since there are more columns than rows, the game ends when the rows are exhausted.   - With (2016) rows (an even number), Andile wins because Zandre will place the last coin in the last column, leaving Andile to place the last coin in the last row.4. Proving (2016) Forbidden Squares are Not Enough:   - Consider the game on a ((2n+1) times (2n+1)) board.   - Claim: If at most (2n) squares are forbidden, Zandre wins.   - Base Case: For (n=0), the board is (1 times 1) with no forbidden squares, and Zandre wins by placing the only coin.   - Inductive Step: Assume the claim holds for (k). Consider a ((2k+1) times (2k+1)) board with at most (2k) forbidden squares.     - If there is at most one forbidden square, Zandre can choose a square in its row.     - If two forbidden squares are in the same row or column, Zandre chooses a non-forbidden square in that row or column.     - If two forbidden squares (X) and (Y) are in different rows and columns, Zandre chooses a square (Z) in the same row as (X) and the same column as (Y).     - After Zandre's move, Andile is left with at most (2k-2) forbidden squares on a ((2k-1) times (2k-1)) board.   - By induction, Zandre wins if at most (2k) squares are forbidden.5. Conclusion:   - Andile needs to declare at least (2017) squares as forbidden to ensure a win.   - Declaring an entire row forbidden (2017 squares) ensures Andile's victory.The final answer is (boxed{2017})."},{"problem":"10.2.

Determine the values of (a) and (d):   Since (a) and (d) must be integers, and we want to maximize (a), we need to minimize (d). Notice that (d) must be even (since (2a + 13d = 130) and 130 is even).

By reflecting at the angle bisector w of this angle, A is mapped to A^{prime}, and thus Q^{prime} is mapped to Q. Consequently, due to the direction of traversal, B is mapped to B^{prime}, C to C^{prime}, D to D^{prime}, and the intersection point P_{1} of AB and A^{prime}B^{prime}, which exists because 0^{circ}<alpha<90^{circ}, is mapped to itself. Therefore, P_{1} lies on w.The segments AB and A^{prime}B^{prime} intersect at the point P_{1} on AB for which angle A Z P_{1}=frac{alpha}{2}. Similarly, it follows that:AB and D^{prime}A^{prime} intersect at the point P_{2} on AB for which angle B Z P_{2}=frac{90^{circ}-alpha}{2}=45^{circ}-frac{alpha}{2}.Since angle A Z P_{2}=frac{alpha}{2}+45^{circ}, and because 0^{circ}<frac{alpha}{2}<frac{alpha}{2}+45^{circ}<90^{circ}, the segment P_{1}P_{2} is thus a side of the polygonal area Q cap Q^{prime}.Similarly, we find the further intersection points P_{3}, P_{4} of BC with D^{prime}A^{prime} and C^{prime}D^{prime}, respectively, P_{5}, P_{6} of CD with C^{prime}D^{prime} and B^{prime}C^{prime}, and P_{7}, P_{8} of DA with B^{prime}C^{prime} and A^{prime}B^{prime}, and thus Q cap Q^{prime} as the octagonal area P_{1}P_{2} ldots P_{8}.By reflecting at w, the intersection point P_{2} of AB and D^{prime}A^{prime} is mapped to the intersection point of A^{prime}B^{prime} and DA, i.e., to P_{8}. Therefore, P_{1}P_{2}=P_{1}P_{8}.Similarly, it follows that any two adjacent sides of Q cap Q^{prime} have the same length s=P_{1}P_{2}, so u(Q cap Q^{prime})=8s.Because angle A^{prime}Z^{prime}B^{prime}=90^{circ} and 0^{circ}<alpha<90^{circ}, the segments ZA and A^{prime}B^{prime} intersect at a point R, and it holds that angle A R P_{8}=angle A^{prime} R Z (vertical angles) and angle R A P_{8}=45^{circ}=angle R A^{prime} Z. Therefore, angle P_{1} P_{8} A=angle R P_{8} A=alpha (angle sum in the triangle), and because angle P_{1} A P_{8}=90^{circ}, we have A P_{1}=s cdot sin alpha.Similarly, we obtain angle P_{2} P_{3} B=90^{circ}-alpha, so P_{2} B=s cdot cos alpha.

Total Number of Tables and Stools: The organizing committee prepared twelve tables and stools in total for each competition venue. This means that when we add the number of tables (x) and the number of stools (y) together, the sum should be twelve. Therefore, we have the equation:   [x + y = 12]2. Total Number of Legs: The sum of the number of legs of the tables and stools is forty.

Thus, m_1 = -frac{a}{2}.Similarly, for l_2 with equation (3-a)x - y + a = 0, the slope m_2 is m_2 = 3-a.Setting the product of the two slopes to -1, we have:(-frac{a}{2})(3-a) = -1Expanding the equation, we get:-frac{3a}{2} + frac{a^2}{2} = -1Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear fractions, we obtain:-3a + a^2 = -2Rearranging, we get a quadratic equation:a^2 - 3a + 2 = 0Factoring the quadratic, we find:(a-1)(a-2) = 0So, a = 1 or a = 2.The condition a = 1 makes l_1 and l_2 perpendicular, but since a = 2 also makes them perpendicular, the condition a = 1 is sufficient but not necessary for l_1 to be perpendicular to l_2.Hence, the answer is:boxed{B}"},{"problem":"4 cdot 218 In a middle school mathematics competition, three problems A, B, and C were given.

Since tan alpha = frac{1}{2}, we have cos alpha = frac{2}{1} = 2. However, this is not possible as the range of the cosine function is [-1, 1]. This suggests we made an error by assuming cos alpha was positive. Instead, we should have cos alpha = -frac{2}{tan alpha} = -2. But again, this is not possible due to the range of the cosine function. The correct approach is to use the Pythagorean identity and solve for sin alpha.Step 4: Substitute tan alpha = frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha} = frac{1}{2} into the Pythagorean identity:begin{aligned}sin^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha &= 1 sin^2 alpha + left(frac{sin alpha}{tan alpha}right)^2 &= 1 sin^2 alpha + left(frac{sin alpha}{frac{1}{2}}right)^2 &= 1 sin^2 alpha + 4sin^2 alpha &= 1 5sin^2 alpha &= 1 sin^2 alpha &= frac{1}{5}. end{aligned}Step 5: Since alpha in left(pi, frac{3}{2} piright), sin alpha is negative in this quadrant.

They jump one by one according to a predetermined order. Each participant performs one jump. We assume that the scores obtained are all non-zero and that every final ranking is equally likely. At any point during the competition, the leader is the participant who has achieved the best score up to that moment. Let  p  be the probability that the leader changes exactly once during the entire competition. Prove that  p > frac{1}{16} .","solution":"We will consider an analogous problem for any number of participating athletes. Let us denote this number by  n . The task is to determine the probability of the event:For each number  k in {0,1, ldots, n-1 } , we define the following event:According to the assumption, each final order is equally probable; hence, the events  B_0, B_1, ldots, B_{n-1}  are equally probable:  P(B_k) = 1/n  for  k = 0,1,ldots,n-1 .Suppose that the event  B_0  occurs - that is, the first jumper becomes the leader and does not relinquish the lead throughout the competition; a change in the leader does not occur. This excludes the occurrence of event  A ; the probability of event  A  given  B_0  is therefore zero:  P(A|B_0) = 0 .Now, let us fix a value  k in {1, ldots, n-1}  and suppose that the event  B_k  occurs. The result of the (k+1)-th jump, being the best in the entire competition, necessarily brings a change in the leader, and this is the last change. The necessary and sufficient condition for this to be the only change can be formulated as follows:Regardless of the results obtained in this series of  k  jumps, any ordering of these results (within this series) is equally probable. The best result can be the first, second, ...,  k -th jump, with equal probability, which is  1/k .This, in particular, is the probability of satisfying condition  W_k , which - as we remember - is equivalent to the occurrence of event  A  given the occurrence of event  B_k . The number  1/k  is therefore the conditional probability:  P(A|B_k) = 1/k  for  k = 1, ldots, n-1 .Based on the formula for total probability, we calculate:For  n = 65 , we get the probability in question in the problem:The sum  1+frac{1}{2}+frac{1}{3}+ldots+frac{1}{64}  can be estimated from below by grouping its terms as follows:In the first parenthesis, we have four terms, in the second eight, in the third sixteen, in the fourth - thirty-two.

Each of these equals  frac{1}{2} ; the total sum of the numbers in these four parentheses exceeds  2 . Therefore, ultimately,(The sum  1+frac{1}{2}+ ldots +frac{1}{64}  can, of course, be calculated with any precision; the value of the probability  p  is  0.07298ldots  to five significant digits: it is a little more than  frac{1}{14} .)Note 3.

The brand sold 100 helmets in April and 144 helmets in June, with the monthly growth rate of sales being the same from April to June.  (1) Find the monthly growth rate of sales for this brand of helmets.  (2) If the cost price of this type of helmet is 30 yuan per helmet, and it is observed that in the market, when the selling price is 40 yuan per helmet, the monthly sales volume is 600 helmets. If with each increase of 1 yuan per helmet, the monthly sales volume decreases by 10 helmets, in order to achieve a monthly sales profit of 10,000 yuan and to provide customers with the best value, what should be the actual selling price of this brand of helmet per helmet?","solution":"To solve the given problems, we proceed as follows:Part (1): Finding the Monthly Growth Rate of SalesLet's denote the monthly growth rate of sales by x. The problem states that the sales increased from 100 helmets in April to 144 helmets in June, with the same monthly growth rate. Since there are two months from April to June, the sales in June can be represented as 100(1+x)^2 = 144. To find x, we solve the equation:begin{align*}100(1+x)^2 &= 144 (1+x)^2 &= frac{144}{100} (1+x)^2 &= 1.44 1+x &= sqrt{1.44} x &= sqrt{1.44} - 1 x &= 1.2 - 1 x &= 0.2 text{ or } x = -2.2end{align*}Since a negative growth rate doesn't make sense in this context, we discard x = -2.2 and conclude that the monthly growth rate is 20%. Thus, boxed{x = 20%}.Part (2): Finding the Actual Selling Price for Maximum ProfitLet the actual selling price of the helmet be m yuan. According to the problem, when the selling price is 40 yuan, the monthly sales volume is 600 helmets. If with each increase of 1 yuan, the monthly sales volume decreases by 10 helmets, then the sales volume can be represented as 600 - 10(m - 40). The profit is given by the selling price minus the cost price, multiplied by the sales volume. We aim for a profit of 10,000 yuan, so we set up the equation:begin{align*}(m - 30)[600 - 10(m - 40)] &= 10,000 (m - 30)(600 - 10m + 400) &= 10,000 (m - 30)(1000 - 10m) &= 10,000 1000m - 10m^2 - 30000 + 300m &= 10,000 -10m^2 + 1300m - 40,000 &= 0 m^2 - 130m + 4000 &= 0end{align*}Solving this quadratic equation, we find that m = 50 or m = 80.

Let's analyze the implications of this information step by step.1. Understanding the Graph's Quadrants:   - The second quadrant is where x  0.   - The fourth quadrant is where x > 0 and y  0, which means m and x must have opposite signs. Since x  0, y must be negative. This implies frac{m}{x}  0 in the fourth quadrant, m must be negative for the fraction to be negative.3. Reconciling the Conditions:   - The above analysis contains a contradiction in the interpretation of the quadrants. The correct interpretation for the graph passing through the second and fourth quadrants is that m must be negative. This is because, for y = frac{m}{x} to yield a positive y when x is negative (second quadrant) and a negative y when x is positive (fourth quadrant), m must consistently be negative.4. Conclusion:   - Therefore, for the graph of the inverse proportion function y = frac{m}{x} to pass through the second and fourth quadrants, m must be less than 0 (m < 0).Given the options:- A: 2- B: -1- C: 1- D: 0The only value of m that is less than 0 is option B: -1.Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{B}."},{"problem":"underline{text { Ans } A .}Numbers 1,2,3, ldots, N are written in a row in such an order that if a number i is written somewhere (not in the first place), then at least one of the numbers i+1 and i-1 will be found somewhere to its left.

Karabas-Barabas has very little money.(4 points)","solution":"Solution. a) If Pinocchio bets 11 gold coins on the first horse, 13 on the second, and 26 on the third, he will always receive at least 2 more gold coins. Indeed, if the first horse wins, he will receive 55 gold coins (11 - return of the bet and 44 winnings), if the second - 52 gold coins (of which 13 is the return of the bet), and if the third - 52 gold coins (26 - return of the bet).It can be proven, for example, by reasoning as in the following section, that such a distribution of Pinocchio's money is strictly unique.b) To guarantee a win, Pierrot must bet on each horse so that the money received for the win (including the return of the bet) exceeds 25 gold coins. Therefore, he must bet more than 25: 5=5 gold coins on the first horse, more than 25: 4=6.25 on the second, and more than 25: 2=12.5 on the third. Since all bets are whole numbers, he must bet a total of 6+7+13=26>25, so he cannot guarantee himself any win.c) Let Papa Carlo bet a total of S gold coins, of which x on the first horse, y on the second, and z on the third (x+y+z=S). Suppose the first horse wins. Then Papa Carlo will receive x+4x=5x, and he needs this amount to be at least 5 more than S. We have the inequality 5x geqslant S+5, which means x geqslant frac{S}{5}+1. Now suppose the second horse wins; similar reasoning leads to the inequality y geqslant frac{S}{4}+1.25. Finally, assuming the third horse wins, we get the inequality z geqslant frac{S}{2}+2.5. Adding all three inequalities, we get x+y+z geqslant frac{19S}{20}+4.75. Since x+y+z=S, the last inequality is equivalent to the condition S geqslant 95.An example where S=95 is obtained if we replace all inequalities in the previous reasoning with equalities. Then x=20, y=25, and z=50. It is easy to check that in any outcome of the races, Papa Carlo will win his 5 gold coins.d) The reasoning is similar to the reasoning in the previous section. Suppose Karabas-Barabas bet S gold coins, of which x on the first horse, y on the second, and z on the third. To guarantee a 6% win, it is necessary to bet on each horse so that the money received for its win (including the return of the bet) is at least 1.06S. This is equivalent to the system of inequalities: 5x geqslant 1.06S, 4y geqslant 1.06S, and 2z geqslant 1.06S. Multiplying the first inequality by 4, the second by 5, and the third by 10, and adding the left and right sides of all three inequalities, we get 20(x+y+z) geqslant 1.06S(4+5+10), from which (considering that x+y+z=S), we get the impossible inequality 20 geqslant 20.14.

Eight other spheres of the same radius r are tangent to pi and tangent to S, they form a \\"collar\\" in which each is tangent to its two neighbors. Express r in terms of R.","solution":"1. Understanding the Geometry:   - We have a large sphere ( S ) of radius ( R ) tangent to a plane ( pi ).   - Eight smaller spheres, each of radius ( r ), are tangent to ( pi ) and to ( S ). These smaller spheres form a \\"collar\\" around ( S ) and are tangent to each other.2. Analyzing the Circle of Tangency:   - When viewed from above, the points of tangency of the smaller spheres with the plane ( pi ) form a circle ( C ) of radius ( r' ).   - The centers of the smaller spheres lie on this circle ( C ).3. Angle Subtended by Adjacent Spheres:   - Since there are 8 smaller spheres, the angle subtended by the centers of two adjacent smaller spheres at the center of ( C ) is ( frac{pi}{4} ).4. Radius of Circle ( C ):   - The radius ( r' ) of circle ( C ) can be expressed in terms of ( r ) using the cosecant function:     [     r' = r cscleft(frac{pi}{8}right)     ]5. Cross-Section Analysis:   - Consider a cross-section through the center of ( S ) and one of the smaller spheres.   - The distance between the centers of ( S ) and a smaller sphere is ( R + r ).   - The length of the common tangent between ( S ) and a smaller sphere in this cross-section is ( r' ).6. Using the Pythagorean Theorem:   - The length of the common tangent ( r' ) can also be found using the Pythagorean theorem:     [     r' = sqrt{(R + r)^2 - (R - r)^2}     ]   - Simplifying the expression inside the square root:     [     r' = sqrt{(R + r)^2 - (R - r)^2} = sqrt{(R + r)^2 - (R^2 - 2Rr + r^2)} = sqrt{4Rr}     ]     [     r' = 2sqrt{Rr}     ]7.

Solving for ( r ):   - Square both sides to eliminate the square root:     [     r^2 csc^2left(frac{pi}{8}right) = 4Rr     ]   - Divide both sides by ( r ) (assuming ( r neq 0 )):     [     r csc^2left(frac{pi}{8}right) = 4R     ]   - Solve for ( r ):     [     r = frac{4R}{csc^2left(frac{pi}{8}right)}     ]9. Simplifying the Expression:   - Recall that ( csc(x) = frac{1}{sin(x)} ), so:     [     csc^2left(frac{pi}{8}right) = frac{1}{sin^2left(frac{pi}{8}right)}     ]   - Therefore:     [     r = 4R sin^2left(frac{pi}{8}right)     ]10.

Since alpha+beta=180^{circ}-gamma, it follows that cos (alpha+beta)= - cos gamma, and from the addition theorems, we get thatsin alpha sin beta=frac{cos (alpha-beta)-cos (alpha+beta)}{2}By transforming the expression using the above relationships, we obtainbegin{aligned}K & =sin alpha sin beta cos gamma+sin ^{2} gamma=frac{1}{2}(cos (alpha-beta)-cos (alpha+beta)) cdot cos gamma+1-cos ^{2} gamma= & =frac{1}{2}(cos (alpha-beta)+cos gamma) cdot cos gamma+1-cos ^{2} gamma= & =frac{1}{2} cos (alpha-beta) cos gamma+1-frac{1}{2} cos ^{2} gamma= & =1-frac{1}{2}left(cos ^{2} gamma-cos (alpha-beta) cos gammaright)= & =1-frac{1}{2}left[left(cos gamma-frac{cos (alpha-beta)}{2}right)^{2}-frac{cos ^{2}(alpha-beta)}{4}right]= & =1+frac{1}{8} cos ^{2}(alpha-beta)-frac{1}{2}left(cos gamma-frac{cos (alpha-beta)}{2}right)^{2}end{aligned}Since the square of any real number is non-negative, and for any real number x, cos ^{2} x leq 1, it follows thatK leq 1+frac{1}{8} cos ^{2}(alpha-beta) leq frac{9}{8}It is also clear that equality holds precisely when alpha=beta and cos gamma=frac{cos 0^{circ}}{2}=frac{1}{2}, i.e., when the triangle is equilateral. This proves the statement.II. solution. Similarly to the first solution, we start from the relationship alpha+beta=180^{circ}-gamma. This implies thatsin gamma=sin (alpha+beta) quad text { and } quad cos gamma=-cos (alpha+beta)Using the addition formulas, we get:begin{aligned}K & =sin alpha sin beta cos gamma+sin ^{2} gamma= & =-sin alpha sin beta(cos alpha cos beta-sin alpha sin beta)+(sin alpha cos beta+cos alpha sin beta)^{2}= & =sin ^{2} alpha sin ^{2} beta+sin ^{2} alpha cos ^{2} beta+cos ^{2} alpha sin ^{2} beta+sin alpha sin beta cos alpha cos betaend{aligned}Since for any angle x, sin ^{2} x+cos ^{2} x=1, it follows thatleft(sin ^{2} alpha+cos ^{2} alpharight)left(sin ^{2} beta+cos ^{2} betaright)=1Thus,sin ^{2} alpha sin ^{2} beta+sin ^{2} alpha cos ^{2} beta+cos ^{2} alpha sin ^{2} beta=1-cos ^{2} alpha cos ^{2} betaTherefore,begin{aligned}K & =1-cos ^{2} alpha cos ^{2} beta+sin alpha sin beta cos alpha cos beta= & =1+cos alpha cos beta(sin alpha sin beta-cos alpha cos beta)=1+cos alpha cos beta cos gammaend{aligned}In a triangle, the product of the cosines of the angles is positive if and only if the triangle is acute. Therefore, if we are looking for the maximum of K, we can assume that the triangle is acute. Since the cos x function is positive and concave from below on the interval left(0, frac{pi}{2}right), by the arithmetic and geometric mean inequality and Jensen's inequality, we haveK leq 1+left(frac{cos alpha+cos beta+cos gamma}{3}right)^{3} leq 1+cos left(frac{alpha+beta+gamma}{3}right)^{3}=1+cos ^{3} 60^{circ}=frac{9}{8}Thus, the maximum value of K is frac{9}{8}, and it is attained precisely when the triangle is equilateral."},{"problem":"2.9.

Find all k such that there exists a k-good function.[i]Proposed by James Rickards, Canada[/i]","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to find all ( k ) such that there exists a ( k )-good function ( f: mathbb{Z}_{>0} to mathbb{Z}_{>0} ). A function ( f ) is ( k )-good if for all ( m neq n ), the greatest common divisor (gcd) of ( f(m) + n ) and ( f(n) + m ) is at most ( k ).2. Analyzing the gcd Condition:   We need to ensure that ( gcd(f(m) + n, f(n) + m) le k ) for all ( m neq n ). Let's consider the parity of ( m ) and ( n ):   - If ( m ) and ( n ) have different parities, then ( f(m) + n ) and ( f(n) + m ) will have different parities if ( f(m) ) and ( f(n) ) have the same parity as ( m ) and ( n ) respectively. This ensures that ( gcd(f(m) + n, f(n) + m) ) is even.   - If ( m ) and ( n ) have the same parity, then ( f(m) + n ) and ( f(n) + m ) will have the same parity if ( f(m) ) and ( f(n) ) have the same parity as ( m ) and ( n ) respectively. This also ensures that ( gcd(f(m) + n, f(n) + m) ) is even.3. Constructing a ( 2 )-Good Function:   We need to construct a function ( f ) such that ( gcd(f(m) + n, f(n) + m) le 2 ) for all ( m neq n ). We will construct this function inductively.4. Base Case:   Let ( f(1) = 2 ).5. Inductive Step:   Suppose we have constructed ( f ) for all ( m ) up to ( n-1 ). We need to define ( f(n) ) such that the gcd condition holds for all ( m < n ). Consider an integer ( C ) larger than ( f(m) + n ) for any ( m < n ). Set ( f(n) = 2^{C! + 1} - n - 1 ).6. Verification:   For any ( m < n ), we have:   [   f(m) + n + f(n) + m equiv 2^{C!+1} + 2^{c} - 2 equiv 2 pmod{4}   ]   where we assume ( f(m) = 2^{c} - m - 1 ) earlier. Thus, ( 4 ) does not divide the gcd. Also, if a prime ( p ) divides ( f(m) + n ), then ( p-1 ) divides ( C! ) and:   [   f(m) + n + f(n) + m equiv 2^{C!+1} + 2^{c} - 2 equiv 2^{c} notequiv 0 pmod{p}   ]   by Fermat's Little Theorem (FLT). Therefore, the gcd condition is satisfied.7. Conclusion:   The function ( f ) constructed is ( 2 )-good. Therefore, ( k ge 2 ) is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a ( k )-good function.The final answer is ( boxed{ k ge 2 } )."},{"problem":"B2. How many natural numbers less than 100000 have a sum of digits divisible by 9 or 5?","solution":"B2. Natural numbers whose sum of digits is divisible by 9 are exactly those divisible by 9.

Every natural number less than 100000 is of the form overline{a b c d e}, where at least one of the digits a, b, c, d, and e is different from 0. If we fix the last four digits and denote their sum by mathrm{s} k, then we must choose a such that k+a is divisible by 5. Regardless of what k is, we have exactly 2 options for a; a=0,5 if k is divisible by 5, a=4,9 if k has a remainder of 1 when divided by 5, a=3,8 if k has a remainder of 2 when divided by 5, a=2,7 if k has a remainder of 3 when divided by 5, and a=1,6 if k has a remainder of 4 when divided by 5. Therefore, the last four digits can be chosen arbitrarily, and for the first digit, we have two options. Thus, there are 10^{4} cdot 2-1=19 999 such numbers, as we have also counted the number 0=overline{00000}.

Since P(z)=0 is a real-coefficient equation, the imaginary roots appear in pairs, so the number of roots in the first quadrant is equal to the number of roots in the fourth quadrant, and the number of roots in the second quadrant is equal to the number of roots in the third quadrant.Now we only need to discuss the number of roots of P(z)=0 in the first quadrant.Let z_{1}=r mathrm{e}^{mathrm{i} theta}left(0<theta<frac{pi}{2}right).

Then the blue points will be exactly the points with integer or half-integer coordinates between (0,0) and (n-1,0) (thus (0.5,0),(1,0),(1.5,0), ldots), which makes 2 n-3 points.To show that this bound is optimal, we introduce an x-axis, ensuring that each point has a different x-coordinate (this is possible since there are infinitely many directions for the axis, but only a finite number of points). We consider the leftmost and rightmost points. The leftmost point allows us to form n-1 midpoints with the remaining points (the x-coordinates of these n-1 midpoints are then distinct since all points have different x-coordinates). The rightmost point, on the other hand, also allows us to form n-1 distinct points by the same argument, but we have counted the midpoint formed by our two extreme points twice, so there are at least (n-1)+(n-1)-1=2 n-3 blue points.## V.

It is largely based on the written course by Igor Kortchemski, available on the POFM website. More specifically, it covers sections 1, 2.1, 2.2, and 2.6 of this course.## First definitions and operations## Definition 1.A function P from mathbb{R} to mathbb{R} is called a polynomial with real coefficients if there exists an integer n geqslant 0 and real numbers a_{0}, a_{1}, ldots, a_{n} such thatP(x)=a_{n} x^{n}+a_{n-1} x^{n-1}+cdots+a_{1} x+a_{0}for all real x.We will see later, in Corollary 5, that, provided we choose n to be minimal, this representation is unique. Once this result is admitted, we can then define the following concepts.## Definition 2.When a_{n} neq 0, we say that- the number n is the degree of P; it is commonly denoted as deg (P);- the numbers a_{0}, a_{1}, ldots, a_{n} are the coefficients of P; the number a_{k} is called the coefficient of degree k of P ;{ }^{1}- the number a_{n} is the leading coefficient of P;- the number a_{0} is the constant coefficient of P; it is thus called because, when P is constant, the only value it takes is a_{0}.When the numbers a_{0}, a_{1}, ldots, a_{n} are all zero, we say that P is the zero polynomial, and we define (somewhat arbitrarily, but this definition will prove practical) its degree as being equal to -infty.Finally, it may happen that we impose other constraints on the coefficients a_{i}. For example, we may be interested in polynomials P for which these coefficients are non-negative or zero; strictly positive; rational; integers; or simply complex numbers, not necessarily real. { }^{2}In general, when mathcal{E} is a set of numbers, we denote by mathcal{E}[X] the set of polynomials whose coefficients belong to mathcal{E}. Thus, mathbb{R}[X] denotes the set of polynomials with real coefficients, and mathbb{Q}[X] the set of polynomials with rational coefficients.In the following, we will use the notations P and P(X), or even a_{n} X^{n}+a_{n-1} X^{n-1}+ cdots+a_{1} X+a_{0} interchangeably to denote this polynomial. However, we strongly advise against using the notation P(x) to denote"},{"problem":"Given that lines *(a)* and *(b)* both intersect with plane *(α)*, the positional relationship between *(a)* and *(b)* isA: ParallelB: IntersectingC: SkewD: Any of the above is possible","solution":"Analysis:This question tests our understanding of the positional relationship judgment of lines in space, which can be determined by the relationship between lines.Answer:Solution: From the positional relationship, it is known that the relationship between *(a)* and *(b)* could be parallel, intersecting, or skew.Hence, the answer is boxed{text{D}}."},{"problem":"If f(n) = 1^{2} + 2^{2} + 3^{2} + ldots + (2n)^{2}, then the recursive relation between f(k+1) and f(k) is __________.","solution":"Given that f(k) = 1^{2} + 2^{2} + ldots + (2k)^{2},Therefore, f(k+1) = 1^{2} + 2^{2} + ldots + (2k)^{2} + (2k+1)^{2} + (2k+2)^{2},Subtracting the two equations, we get f(k+1) - f(k) = (2k+1)^{2} + (2k+2)^{2}.Thus, f(k+1) = f(k) + (2k+1)^{2} + (2k+2)^{2}.By subtracting the equations for f(k) and f(k+1), we can find the recursive relation between f(k+1) and f(k).

Given that angle A = 135^circ in triangle ABC, we can determine the other angles in the triangle. Let angle ABC = beta. Then, angle ACB = 180^circ - 135^circ - beta = 45^circ - beta.2. The perpendicular to AB at A intersects BC at D. This means angle DAB = 90^circ.3. The angle bisector of angle B intersects AC at E. By the Angle Bisector Theorem, frac{AE}{EC} = frac{AB}{BC}.4. We need to find angle BED. To do this, we first analyze the angles in triangle ADC:   - angle ADC = 90^circ + beta because angle DAB = 90^circ and angle BAC = 135^circ.5. Using the Law of Sines in triangle ADC:   [   frac{sin(45^circ - beta)}{AD} = frac{sin 45^circ}{CD} implies frac{AD}{CD} = frac{sin(45^circ - beta)}{sin 45^circ} = cos beta - sin beta   ]6.

Invariant of the Average Position:   - Initially, each person stands on a whole number from (0) to (2022). The average position of all people is:     [     text{Average} = frac{0 + 1 + 2 + cdots + 2022}{2023} = frac{frac{2022 cdot 2023}{2}}{2023} = 1011     ]   - Each move involves two people moving towards each other by 1 unit each. This does not change the sum of their positions, and hence the average position remains (1011).2. Sum of Distances (S):   - Let (S) be the sum of distances between every pair of people. We will show that (S) decreases with each move.   - Consider two people (A) and (B) standing at positions (a) and (b) respectively, with (a + 2 leq b). They move to (a+1) and (b-1) respectively.3. Effect on (S):   - We categorize the effect on (S) based on the positions of other people relative to (A) and (B):     - People standing on (a) or less: Their distance to (A) increases by 1, but their distance to (B) decreases by 1. Thus, their contribution to (S) is unchanged.     - People standing on (b) or greater: Their distance to (A) decreases by 1, but their distance to (B) increases by 1. Thus, their contribution to (S) is unchanged.     - People standing in ((a, b)): Their distance to (A) decreases by 1, and their distance to (B) decreases by 1. Thus, their contribution to (S) decreases by 2 per person.   - Additionally, the distance between (A) and (B) themselves decreases by 2.4. Decrease in (S):   - Even if no one is in the interval ((a, b)), the distance between (A) and (B) decreases by 2. Therefore, (S) decreases by at least 2 per move.   - Since (S) is a non-negative integer and decreases by at least 2 per move, the process must terminate after a finite number of moves.5. Final Configuration:   - The final configuration must have all people standing at the same position, as any other configuration would allow further moves.   - Given the invariant that the average position is (1011), the only possible final configuration is that all people stand at position (1011).(blacksquare)The final answer is all people standing at position ( boxed{ 1011 } )."},{"problem":"Calculate ((- dfrac {2}{21})÷( dfrac {1}{6}- dfrac {3}{14}+ dfrac {2}{3}- dfrac {9}{7}).)","solution":"According to the operation method of mixed operations with rational numbers, we need to find the value of the expression ((- dfrac {2}{21})÷( dfrac {1}{6}- dfrac {3}{14}+ dfrac {2}{3}- dfrac {9}{7})).

If Li buys 60 more books than the number of students, he can pay at the wholesale price, which means x + 60 geq 250.Solving these inequalities:- From x + 60 geq 250, we subtract 60 from both sides to get x geq 190.- The other condition gives us directly x < 250.Combining these, we get the range of x as 190 leq x < 250.Therefore, the range of the number of 8th-grade students in the school is boxed{190 leq x < 250}.# Part 2: Finding the Exact Number of 8th-Grade StudentsGiven that the cost of buying 288 books at the wholesale price is the same as the cost of buying 240 books at the retail price, we can set up an equation to find the exact number of students, denoted as a.The retail price per book is frac{240}{a} yuan, and the wholesale price per book is frac{260}{a+60} yuan.

The formation cannot consist of only liars (in such a case, 3-6 would be telling the truth). Consider the tallest knight, let's call him P.

Since M N is bisected perpendicularly by the altitude of B C, according to (3), we have P_{1} P_{2} P_{3} geqslant M_{1} M_{2} M_{3}=N_{1} N_{2} N_{3}. Since N is a point on the line segment R S^{prime}, and R S^{prime} is bisected perpendicularly by the altitude of A C, according to (3), we have N_{1} N_{2} N_{3} geqslant R_{1} R_{2} R_{3}.therefore quad P_{1} P_{2} P_{3} geqslant R_{1} R_{2} R_{3}. Noting (4), we know that when P varies inside the hexagon Omega (including the sides), the minimum value is taken at the six vertices, but triangle R Q S is contained within the hexagon Omega, and its vertices R, Q, and S are exactly three vertices of the hexagon Omega, so when P varies inside triangle R Q S, P_{1} P_{2} P_{3} takes its minimum value at the three vertices R, Q, and S.

Conclusion: Since f(-x) = f(x), f(x) is an even function.   boxed{text{Even Function}}# Part 2: Finding the Minimum Value of f(x)1. Let t=cos x, so that -1leq t leq 1.2. Rewrite the function in terms of t:   y=-t^{2}+3t+4.3. Note that the vertex form of a parabola reveals the axis of symmetry, but since the parabola opens downwards and t is limited to [-1,1], we focus on this interval.4. The function is increasing on [-1,1] due to the nature of -t^2 + 3t + 4. However, note that this part of the explanation is incorrect in the standard solution provided; the function -t^{2}+3t+4 actually reaches its maximum value within [-1,1] at its vertex, which is not at t=-1.5. Correcting the explanation, the vertex of the parabola y = -t^2 + 3t + 4 is found using t = -frac{b}{2a} = -frac{3}{2(-1)} = frac{3}{2}. However, since the vertex is outside the interval [-1,1], the minimum value within the domain of t occurs at the endpoints.6. At t=-1 (which corresponds to cos x = -1), x=pi within the given domain of x in [0,2pi], which is when the function f(x) reaches its minimum on the interval.7. Calculate the minimum value:   f(pi) = -(-1)^2 + 3(-1) + 4 = 0.8. Therefore, the minimum value of f(x) is 0 when x = pi.   boxed{0 text{ at } x = pi}# Part 3: Writing Down the Zeros of the Function f(x) on the Interval [0,2pi]1.

Solutions for cos x are cos x = -1 or cos x = 4. Discarding cos x = 4 since it's not a valid cosine value.4. cos x = -1 gives x = pi within [0,2pi].5.

What is the greatest number of balls of radius 7 that can simultaneously touch, without intersecting, a ball of radius 3?Transition to space.","solution":"335. We will prove that there cannot be more than six such spheres. Suppose there are seven. We connect the centers of all seven spheres with the center of the given sphere and denote by O_{1}, O_{2}, ldots, O_{7} the points of intersection of these segments with the surface of the given sphere. For each point O_{i}, we consider the set of points on the sphere for which the distance (along the surface of the sphere) to the point O_{i} is no greater than the distance to any other point O_{k}, k neq i. The sphere will be divided into seven spherical polygons. Each polygon is the intersection of six hemispheres containing the point O_{i}, the boundaries of which are great circles, along which the plane passing through the midpoint of the segment O_{i} O_{k} and perpendicular to it intersects the sphere.Each of the resulting polygons contains a circle inside it, the spherical radius of which is seen from the center of the original sphere at an angle alpha, sin alpha=0.7.Let K and N be the number of sides and vertices of the resulting partition, respectively. (Each side is a common side of two adjacent polygons and is counted once. The same applies to vertices.) It is easy to see that for such a partition, Euler's formula holds (see problem 324). In our case, this gives K=N+5. On the other hand, K geqslant frac{3}{2} N, since at least three sides emanate from each vertex, and each side is counted twice.It is not difficult to obtain that K leqslant 15, N leqslant 10. In problem 325, we proved that among all spherical n-gons containing a given circle, the smallest area is that of a regular n-gon. Moreover, it can be shown that the sum of the areas of regular n- and (n+2)-gons is greater than twice the area of a regular n-gon. (We consider polygons circumscribed around the same circle.) It is also obvious that the area of a regular circumscribed n-gon decreases with increasing n. From this, it follows that the sum of the areas of the resulting seven polygons cannot be less than the sum of the areas of five regular quadrilaterals and two regular pentagons circumscribed around circles with a spherical radius corresponding to the central angle alpha=arcsin 0.7.

Initial Observations:   - The set of divisors of ( n ) excluding ( n ) itself must be partitioned into two subsets ( F ) and ( T ) with at least 2 elements each.   - The number of divisors of ( n ) (denoted ( tau(n) )) must be at least 5 because ( |F| + |T| + 1 geq 4 ).2. Squarefree Condition:   - If ( n ) is not squarefree, it must be the square of a prime ( p ). However, in this case, ( n ) would have only 2 divisors (1 and ( p )), which contradicts ( tau(n) geq 5 ). Therefore, ( n ) must be squarefree.3. Case Analysis:   - Suppose ( n = p_1 p_2 cdots p_k ) where ( p_i ) are distinct primes.4. Case 1: ( 1 in T ):   - If ( 1 in T ), then for some ( u geq 2 ), the triangular numbers ( 1, 3, dots, frac{u(u+1)}{2} ) must divide ( n ).   - If ( u geq 3 ), then ( 6 mid n ), implying ( 2 in F ). Since ( 1 notin F ), ( 3 in F ) (as ( |F| geq 2 )), leading to a contradiction because ( 3 ) cannot be in both ( F ) and ( T ). Thus, ( u = 2 ) and ( T = {1, 3} ).   - ( n ) must be odd, so ( F ) cannot contain any even Fibonacci numbers, forcing ( |F| = 2 ). This implies ( n ) has exactly 5 divisors, which is impossible because ( n ) has ( 2^k ) divisors. Hence, this case yields no solutions.5. Case 2: ( 1 in F ):   - If ( 1 in F ), then for some ( u geq 2 ), the Fibonacci numbers ( 1, 2, 3, dots, F_u ) must divide ( n ).   - Since ( 8 notmid n ) (as ( n ) is squarefree), ( u ) can be 2, 3, or 4.   - If ( u = 2 ), then ( F = {1, 2} ). This implies ( 2^k = |F| + |T| + 1 geq 5 ), so ( n ) must be of the form ( 2pq ). However, one of ( p ) or ( q ) would exceed 5, which cannot be triangular. Thus, ( u = 3 ) or ( 4 ).   - If ( u = 3 ), then ( F = {1, 2, 3} ). No prime greater than 3 divides ( n ), so ( n = 2 cdot 3 = 6 ), which does not work because it has only 3 proper divisors.   - If ( u = 4 ), then ( F = {1, 2, 3, 5} ).

We need to find the only element in the set ({1, 2, 3, 4, ldots} cap left{frac{404}{r^2-4} ;bigg| ; r in mathbb{Q} backslash {-2, 2}right}).2. Let ( r in mathbb{Q} backslash {-2, 2} ). Then ( r ) can be written as ( frac{p}{q} ) where ( p ) and ( q ) are integers with ( q neq 0 ) and (gcd(p, q) = 1).3. We need to compute ( frac{404}{r^2 - 4} ). First, express ( r^2 - 4 ) in terms of ( p ) and ( q ):   [   r^2 - 4 = left(frac{p}{q}right)^2 - 4 = frac{p^2}{q^2} - 4 = frac{p^2 - 4q^2}{q^2}   ]4.

Since ( gcd(p, q) = 1 ), ( p^2 - 4q^2 ) must be a divisor of 404. The divisors of 404 are ( pm 1, pm 2, pm 4, pm 101, pm 202, pm 404 ).7. We need to find ( p ) and ( q ) such that ( p^2 - 4q^2 ) is one of these divisors. Let's test ( p^2 - 4q^2 = 101 ):   [   p^2 - 4q^2 = 101   ]   This can be factored as:   [   (p - 2q)(p + 2q) = 101   ]8. Since 101 is a prime number, the factor pairs are ( (1, 101) ) and ( (-1, -101) ). Let's solve for ( p ) and ( q ) using the pair ( (1, 101) ):   [   p - 2q = 1 quad text{and} quad p + 2q = 101   ]9. Adding these equations:   [   2p = 102 implies p = 51   ]   Subtracting these equations:   [   4q = 100 implies q = 25   ]10. Now, substitute ( p = 51 ) and ( q = 25 ) back into the expression for ( r ):    [    r = frac{p}{q} = frac{51}{25}    ]11. Compute ( r^2 - 4 ):    [    r^2 - 4 = left(frac{51}{25}right)^2 - 4 = frac{2601}{625} - 4 = frac{2601 - 2500}{625} = frac{101}{625}    ]12.

Determine all real numbers p for which the equation(x-1)^{2}=3|x|-p xhas exactly three distinct solutions in the set of real numbers.","solution":"3. Although the given problem can be solved by a vivid geometric consideration about the relative position of the parabola y=(x-1)^{2} and the broken line y=3|x|-p x, we will first prefer a purely algebraic approach.The given equation clearly has no solution x=0. After removing the absolute value and a simple rearrangement, we get the equationsbegin{array}{ll}x^{2}+(p+1) x+1=0 & text { for } x<0, x^{2}+(p-5) x+1=0 & text { for } x>0.end{array}Since each quadratic equation has at most two different roots, we are looking for all numbers p for which one of the equations (1), (2) has one root and the other has two different roots (and always of the prescribed signs). Note that for each q in mathbb{R}, the real roots x_{1,2} of the equation x^{2}+q x+1=0 (if they exist at all) have the same sign, which is opposite to the sign of the number q; indeed, x_{1} x_{2}=1 and x_{1}+x_{2}=-q.

Of these four values, only the numbers p=1 and p=3 lie in the interval (-1,5), and for p=1 we get D_{2}=12>0, and for p=3 we get D_{1}=12>0.Answer. The sought values are p=1 and p=3.Alternative solution. The graph of the function y=(x-1)^{2} is a parabola mathrm{s} with vertex V[1,0], and the graph of the function y=3|x|-p x is a broken line consisting of the sides of some angle with vertex O[0,0] (Fig. 3a for p=2). Both graphs have three common points precisely when one of the sides of the mentioned angle is a tangent to the parabola and the other is its \\"secant\\". Since the parabola under consideration does not have a tangent parallel to the y-axis, we can look for the equations of both tangents passing through the point [0,0] in the form y=k x. As is known, the slope k is determined by the condition that the equation k x=(x-1)^{2} has a double root, i.e., a zero discriminant. The discriminant has the expression (k+2)^{2}-4, so the sought values are k_{1}=0, k_{2}=-4 and the corresponding points of tangency are T_{1}=V[1,0] and T_{2}[-1,4]. From the equations for the slopes of the tangent sides of the angles 3-p=0 and -3-p=-4, we find the solutions p_{1}=3 and p_{2}=1 and easily verify that the other side is indeed a secant of the parabola in both cases (Fig. 3b for p=3 and Fig. 3c for p=1).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_16872b628cb10877d512g-4.jpg?height=571&width=502&top_left_y=1573&top_left_x=206)a) p=2![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_16872b628cb10877d512g-4.jpg?height=574&width=508&top_left_y=1569&top_left_x=751)b) p=3![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_16872b628cb10877d512g-4.jpg?height=577&width=492&top_left_y=1570&top_left_x=1316)c) p=1Fig. 3For a complete solution, 6 points are awarded.

By what percentage will the amount of lemon drink produced increase with the same volumes of lemon supplies?","solution":"Answer: By 50 %.Solution. Method 1. The content of lemon juice in the drink after the CEO's directive decreased by one and a half times. This means that from the same lemons, one and a half times more lemon drink can be made. In other words, the amount of lemon drink produced will increase by one and a half times or by 50 %.underline{2} Method. Let x be the amount of drink produced before the CEO's directive. Then the amount of lemon juice in this drink is -0.15 cdot x. Let y be the amount of drink produced after the CEO's directive. Then the amount of lemon juice in this drink is -0.1 cdot y. Since it is assumed that the amount of lemon juice has not changed, we get the equation 0.15 cdot x = 0.1 cdot y. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 10, we get: y = 1.5 cdot x; or: y = x + 0.5 cdot x.

From this, John was able to determine the number of problems Mary solved correctly.  If Mary's score had been any lower, but still over 80, John could not have determined this.  What was Mary's score?  (Recall that the AHSME consists of 30 multiple-choice problems and that one's score, s, is computed by the formula s = 30 + 4c - w, where c is the number of correct and w is the number of wrong answers; students are not penalized for problems left unanswered.)","solution":"1. We start by understanding the scoring formula for the AHSME:    [   s = 30 + 4c - w   ]   where ( s ) is the score, ( c ) is the number of correct answers, and ( w ) is the number of wrong answers. Note that the total number of questions is 30, so ( c + w + u = 30 ), where ( u ) is the number of unanswered questions.2. Given that Mary's score is over 80, we can write:   [   30 + 4c - w > 80 implies 4c - w > 50   ]3. John can determine the number of problems Mary solved correctly based on her score. This implies that for Mary's score ( s ), there is a unique pair ((c, w)) that satisfies the equation ( s = 30 + 4c - w ).4. If Mary's score had been any lower but still over 80, John could not have determined the number of problems Mary solved correctly. This means that for any score ( s' ) such that ( 80 < s' < s ), there must be multiple pairs ((c, w)) that satisfy ( s' = 30 + 4c - w ).5. We need to find the smallest score ( s ) such that ( 4c - w > 50 ) and for any score ( s' ) in the range ( 80 < s' < s ), there are multiple pairs ((c, w)) that satisfy the equation.6. Let's consider the possible values of ( c ) and ( w ) that satisfy ( 4c - w > 50 ). We need to find the smallest ( s ) such that there is a unique solution for ( c ) and ( w ).7. We start by testing values of ( c ) and ( w ):   - If ( c = 13 ) and ( w = 0 ):     [     s = 30 + 4 cdot 13 - 0 = 30 + 52 = 82     ]     This score is over 80, but we need to check if there are other pairs ((c, w)) that give the same score for any lower score.   - If ( c = 14 ) and ( w = 1 ):     [     s = 30 + 4 cdot 14 - 1 = 30 + 56 - 1 = 85     ]     This score is over 80, and we need to check if there are other pairs ((c, w)) that give the same score for any lower score.8. We continue this process until we find the smallest score ( s ) such that there is a unique pair ((c, w)) for ( s ) and multiple pairs for any lower score.9. After testing various values, we find that:   - For ( c = 23 ) and ( w = 0 ):     [     s = 30 + 4 cdot 23 - 0 = 30 + 92 = 122     ]     This score is over 80, and we need to check if there are other pairs ((c, w)) that give the same score for any lower score.   - For ( c = 24 ) and ( w = 1 ):     [     s = 30 + 4 cdot 24 - 1 = 30 + 96 - 1 = 125     ]     This score is over 80, and we need to check if there are other pairs ((c, w)) that give the same score for any lower score.10. We find that the smallest score ( s ) such that there is a unique pair ((c, w)) for ( s ) and multiple pairs for any lower score is ( 119 ).The final answer is (boxed{119})."},{"problem":"Problem 9.6.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to ensure that in any partition of the set ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ), one of the subsets will always contain three numbers ( a, b, c ) such that ( ab = c ). This is a problem related to Ramsey theory, specifically dealing with the multiplicative properties of numbers.2. Lower Bound:   First, we need to establish a lower bound for ( n ). We can do this by constructing a partition of ( {1, 2, ldots, n-1} ) such that neither subset contains three numbers ( a, b, c ) with ( ab = c ).   Consider the set ( {1, 2, ldots, 95} ). We can partition this set into two subsets as follows:   [   A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95}   ]   [   B = {6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94}   ]   In this partition, neither subset ( A ) nor ( B ) contains three numbers ( a, b, c ) such that ( ab = c ). Therefore, ( n geq 96 ).3. Upper Bound:   Now, we need to show that ( n = 96 ) is sufficient. We will prove that for any partition of ( {1, 2, ldots, 96} ) into two subsets, one of the subsets will contain three numbers ( a, b, c ) such that ( ab = c ).   Consider the numbers ( 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 96 ). We will analyze the possible partitions of these numbers.   - If ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are in the same subset, then:     - If ( 4 ) is also in the same subset, then ( 6, 8, 12 ) must be in the other subset. But then ( 48 ) and ( 96 ) must be in the same subset as ( 2 ) and ( 3 ), forming the triple ( (2, 24, 48) ).     - If ( 4 ) is not in the same subset, then ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) are in the other subset, so ( 24 ) must be in the same subset as ( 2 ) and ( 3 ), forming the triple ( (3, 8, 24) ).   - If ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are in different subsets, then:     - If ( 4 ) is in the same subset as ( 2 ), then ( 8 ) must be in the same subset as ( 2 ), forming the triple ( (2, 4, 8) ).     - If ( 4 ) is in the same subset as ( 3 ), then ( 12 ) must be in the same subset as ( 3 ), forming the triple ( (3, 4, 12) ).

Part A: Finding the Irreducible Polynomial ( g(x) )   We need to find an irreducible polynomial ( g(x) ) such that ( f(n) = g(n) ) for all sixish ( n ). By definition, a sixish number ( n ) can be written as ( n = p(p+6) ), where ( p ) and ( p+6 ) are prime numbers. The divisors of ( n ) are ( 1, p, p+6, ) and ( p(p+6) ). Therefore, the function ( f(n) ) which sums the squares of the divisors of ( n ) is given by:   [   f(n) = 1^2 + p^2 + (p+6)^2 + (p(p+6))^2   ]   We need to express ( p ) in terms of ( n ). Note that:   [   n = p(p+6) = p^2 + 6p   ]   Solving for ( p ):   [   p^2 + 6p - n = 0   ]   Using the quadratic formula:   [   p = frac{-6 pm sqrt{36 + 4n}}{2} = -3 pm sqrt{9 + n}   ]   Since ( p ) is a positive integer, we take:   [   p = sqrt{n + 9} - 3   ]   Substituting ( p ) back into the expression for ( f(n) ):   [   f(n) = 1 + (sqrt{n+9} - 3)^2 + (sqrt{n+9} + 3)^2 + n^2   ]   Expanding and simplifying:   [   (sqrt{n+9} - 3)^2 = n + 9 - 6sqrt{n+9} + 9 = n + 18 - 6sqrt{n+9}   ]   [   (sqrt{n+9} + 3)^2 = n + 9 + 6sqrt{n+9} + 9 = n + 18 + 6sqrt{n+9}   ]   Adding these together:   [   f(n) = 1 + (n + 18 - 6sqrt{n+9}) + (n + 18 + 6sqrt{n+9}) + n^2   ]   [   f(n) = 1 + n + 18 + n + 18 + n^2 = n^2 + 2n + 37   ]   Therefore, the irreducible polynomial ( g(x) ) is:   [   boxed{g(x) = x^2 + 2x + 37}   ]2.

We start by analyzing the given recurrence relation for the sequence ((a_n)_{n geq 1}):   [   a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n+2} quad text{for} quad n geq 2.   ]   This implies that each term in the sequence is the sum of the previous term and the term two places ahead.2. To find the maximum number of consecutive positive terms, we first consider a specific example. Let's take the sequence starting with (a_1 = 1), (a_2 = 2), (a_3 = 3), (a_4 = 1), and (a_5 = 1). We check if these terms satisfy the recurrence relation:   [   a_2 = a_1 + a_4 implies 2 = 1 + 1,   ]   [   a_3 = a_2 + a_5 implies 3 = 2 + 1.   ]   Both equations are satisfied, and we have five consecutive positive terms: (1, 2, 3, 1, 1).3.

Therefore:   [   f(2m^2) geq 2f(2m^2) - 4f(m)^2 implies 4f(m)^2 geq f(2m^2)   ]9. From ( spadesuit ), we have:   [   f(2m^2) geq f(2)f(m^2) = 4f(m)^2   ]   Hence:   [   f(m)^2 geq f(m^2)   ]   But ( spadesuit ) implies:   [   f(m^2) geq f(m)^2   ]   Therefore, we have:   [   f(m^2) = f(m)^2   ]10. Considering ( P(m, m) ), it is easy to see that:    [    f(2m^2) = 4f(m)^2    ]11. Now, it is easy to see that:    [    f(2^k) = 2^{2k} quad forall k in mathbb{N}    ]12. In ( spadesuit ), consider ( P(m, 2m) ):    [    f(2m^2) = f(m)f(2m)    ]    But:    [    f(2m^2) = 4f(m)^2    ]    Therefore:    [    4f(m)^2 = f(m)f(2m) implies f(2m) = 4f(m) quad forall m in mathbb{N}    ]13. We have proved:    [    (f(m) + 1)^2 = f(m^2 + 1)    ]    Take ( m = 3 ) to get:    [    (f(3) + 1)^2 = f(10)    ]    We have proved ( f(5) = 25 ) and ( f(2n) = 4f(n) ), therefore:    [    f(10) = 4f(5) = 100 implies f(10) = 100    ]    Therefore:    [    (f(3) + 1)^2 = 100 implies f(3) = 9    ]14. We have proved:    [    f(1) = 1, quad f(2) = 4, quad f(3) = 9, quad f(4) = 16, quad f(5) = 25    ]    We now claim:    [    f(n) = n^2 quad forall n in mathbb{N}    ]15. Let's say it is true till some positive integers ( n ). We have already proved ( f(2n) = 4f(n) ), hence, if we know ( f(n) ), we can find ( f(2n) ).16. Let ( m = 2x + 1 ) be an odd integer. Then:    [    (f(m) + 1)^2 = f(m^2 + 1) implies (f(m) + 1)^2 = f(4x^2 + 4x + 2) = 2f(2x^2 + 2x + 1)    ]    [    = 2f(x^2 + (x + 1)^2)    ]17. Taking ( P(x, x + 1) ) in:    [    2f(mn) geq f(m^2 + n^2) - f(m)^2 - f(n)^2 geq 2f(m)f(n)    ]    We can find ( f(x^2 + (x + 1)^2) ).18. We have proved that ( f(m^2 + 1) = (f(m) + 1)^2 ). It is easy to show that for all the numbers in the sequence, ( f(u_n) = u_n^2 ).19. Taking ( P(m, u_n) ), we can conclude:    [    f(m^2 + u_n^2) = (f(m) + u_n^2)^2 quad forall n in mathbb{N}    ]    (All the numbers in this sequence).20. To complete the induction, we only have to prove the \\"odd integers case\\". Let ( m = 2x + 1 ) be an odd integer. Taking ( n = 1 ), we get ( u_n = 1 ). If we take ( n = 1 ), it only remains to find the value of ( f(x(x + 1)) ).21. Notice that taking even ( n ) does not help, so we will take only odd ( n )'s. Taking ( n = 3 ), we get ( u_n = 5 ). We have proved:    [    f(m^2 + u_n^2) = (f(m) + u_n^2)^2 quad forall n in mathbb{N}    ]    Therefore:    [    f(m^2 + 25) = (f(m) + 25)^2    ]    Take ( m = 2x + 1 ):    [    f(4x^2 + 4x + 26) = (f(2x + 1) + 25)^2 = 2f(2x^2 + 2x + 13) = 2f((x + 3)^2 + (x - 2)^2)    ]22. Take ( P(x + 3, x - 2) ) in the original inequality, it remains to find the value of ( f(x^2 + x - 6) ).23. Induction Complete.

The closed broken line B C D E F B forms a five-pointed \\"star\\". The sum of the angles at the rays of this star is 180^{circ}.We will prove that the sum of the angles at the rays of any five-pointed star B C D E F B is 180^{circ}. Let O be the point of intersection of the lines B F and E D, and the angle between them is B O D=alpha. Denote the angle at the ray by the same letter as the vertex of the ray.angle E+angle F=180^{circ}-alpha=angle O B D+angle O D B .Therefore,begin{array}{r}180^{circ}=angle C+angle C B D+angle C D B=angle C+(angle B+angle O B D)+(angle D+angle O D B)= quad=angle C+angle B+angle D+(angle O B D+angle O D B)=angle C+angle B+angle D+angle E+angle Fend{array}Another proof. Let the ray bar{a} coincide with the ray В C. Rotate the ray bar{a} until it coincides with the ray B F. The ray bar{a} will rotate by the angle angle B. Then rotate the ray bar{a} (in its new position) until it coincides with the ray E F. The ray bar{a} will rotate by another angle angle F, and from the start of the movement, by the angle angle B+angle F. Then rotate the ray bar{a} again, this time until it coincides with the ray E D. The ray bar{a} will rotate by another angle angle D, and from the start of the movement, by the angle angle B+angle F+angle E. After performing two more similar rotations, the ray bar{a} will coincide with the ray C B, i.e., it will have rotated by 180^{circ} from the start of the movement and, at the same time, by the sum of the angles angle B+angle F+angle E+angle D+angle C.The point of intersection of the segments A B and F G is the point K(2 ; 3).We will prove this. Let L(2 ; 0), M(7 ; 0). Then triangle K F L sim triangle G F M, since their legs are proportional. Therefore, angle K F L=angle G F M, so K in F G. Similarly, K in A B.Another way. The equation of the line A B: y=4 x-5. The equation of the line F G: y=frac{3}{5} x+frac{9}{5}. Solving the system of these two equations, we get the coordinates of the intersection point of these lines: (2 ; 3).Find the lengths of the sides of triangle B K G: B K=sqrt{1^{2}+4^{2}}=sqrt{17}, B G= sqrt{4^{2}+(-1)^{2}}=sqrt{17}, G K=sqrt{5^{2}+3^{2}}=sqrt{34}. The triangle triangle B K G is isosceles and, by the converse of the Pythagorean theorem, it is a right triangle.Therefore, the angle angle B K G=45^{circ}. It is an exterior angle for triangle F K B and angle K F B+angle K B F=45^{circ}. Since angle A B C=angle F B C-angle F B A, angle E F G=angle E F B-angle G F B, the required sum of the anglesbegin{gathered}angle A B C+angle E F G+angle B C D+angle C D E+angle D E F= =angle F B C+angle E F B-(angle F B A+angle G F B)+angle B C D+angle C D E+angle D E F= =180^{circ}-45^{circ}=135^{circ}end{gathered}Remark. A similar solution can be obtained based on the fact that the sum of the angles at the rays of any seven-pointed \\"star\\" is also 180^{circ} (the proof, in essence, does not differ from the second proof for a five-pointed star). Since the angle angle B K G=45^{circ}, the sum of the two angles of the seven-pointed star with vertices at points A and G is 45^{circ}.Grading criteria. Full solution 15 points.

Considering the motorcycle's speed is 14 times that of A, dividing frac{2}{3} S into 14 parts, when A has walked 13 parts, B returns to point D, and then both can arrive at point A simultaneously.

Speaking intuitively, we only consider the permutations of the numbers 1,2, ldots, n where each number either remains in its original position in the base order or takes the place of one of its neighbors. Thus, for the numbers 2,3, ldots, n-1, 3 positions come into play, while for the numbers 1 and n, only 2 positions are available.Let p_{n} denote the number of n-element permutations that satisfy (1). According to (1), the value of i_{n} is either n or (n-1). In the first case, left(i_{1}, i_{2}, ldots, i_{n-1}right) is a permutation of the numbers 1,2, ldots, n-1 that also satisfies (1), so their number is p_{n-1}. In the second case, n can only be equal to i_{n-1}, so left(i_{1}, i_{2}, ldots, i_{n-2}right) is a (1) permutation of the first (n-2) natural numbers. The number of these is p_{n-2}, thusp_{n}=p_{n-1}+p_{n-2}Naturally, (2) only makes sense for n>2, so to determine the values of p_{n}, we need the first two values, which are clearly p_{1}=1, p_{2}=2. These initial values, together with (2), uniquely determine the value of p_{n}.2. In the following, we seek an explicit expression for p_{n}.In general, sequences that satisfy (2) are called Fibonacci-like sequences. From (2), the following three properties of Fibonacci-like sequences directly follow:a) If the sequence a_{n} is a Fibonacci-like sequence, then the sequence c_{n}=lambda a_{n}, where lambda is any real number, is also of this type.b) If the sequences a_{n}, b_{n} are Fibonacci-like sequences, then the sequence c_{n}=a_{n}+b_{n} is also of this type.c) The geometric sequence a_{n}=q^{n} is a Fibonacci-like sequence if and only if q is a root of the equationq^{2}=q+1that is, iftext { either } quad q_{1}=frac{1+sqrt{5}}{2}, quad text { or } quad q_{2}=frac{1-sqrt{5}}{2} text {. }It is sufficient, therefore, to find numbers alpha, beta such that the sequence c_{n}=alpha q_{1}^{n}+beta q_{2}^{n} has its first two terms equal to the first two terms of the above p_{n} sequence, then for all n, p_{n}=c_{n}. Such a pair of numbers can be found from the system of equations:q_{1} alpha+q_{2} beta=p_{1}=1 quad q_{1}^{2} alpha+q_{2}^{2} beta=p_{2}=2alpha=frac{sqrt{5}+1}{2 sqrt{5}} quad text { or } quad frac{q_{1}}{sqrt{5}}, quad beta=frac{sqrt{5}-1}{2 sqrt{5}} quad text { or } -frac{q_{2}}{sqrt{5}}Therefore,p_{n}=frac{1}{sqrt{5}}left(q_{1}^{n+1}-q_{2}^{n+1}right)=frac{1}{sqrt{5}}left{left(frac{1+sqrt{5}}{2}right)^{n+1}-left(frac{1-sqrt{5}}{2}right)^{n+1}right}This gives us the expression for p_{n} in terms of the index n alone.

How many ways are there to make the assignments that satisfy these properties?(A) 128(B) 343(C) 486(D) 924(E) 1716## Numerical answer problems -5 points","solution":"12. The answer is (D). For convenience, let's imagine the dancers and dancers arranged horizontally, from left to right. The condition in the text can be translated as follows. Let B_{i} be the set of dancers assigned to the i-th dancer, with i=1, ldots, 7. To respect the condition in the text (that the segments do not cross), the dancers in B_{2} must all be to the right of those in B_{1} (except that the rightmost dancer in B_{1} can coincide with the leftmost dancer in B_{2}), and so on: the dancers in B_{3} are all to the right of those in B_{2} (except that the last to the right in B_{2} can coincide with the first to the left in B_{3}), those in B_{4} to the right of those in B_{3}, and so forth. In particular, each set B_{i} intersects with at most one element of B_{i-1} and at most one element of B_{i+1} (provided that i-1 geq 1 text{ and } i+1 leq 7). The total number of dancers assigned, i.e., the total number of segments drawn, is13=left|B_{1}right|+left|B_{2}right|+cdots+left|B_{7}right| leqleft|B_{1} cup B_{2} cup cdots cup B_{7}right|+6 text {, }where the inequality holds because the dancers in common between the various sets are at most 6 (one between B_{1} and B_{2}, one between B_{2} and B_{3}, etc.). In particular, left|B_{1} cup cdots cup B_{7}right| must be greater than or equal to 7, i.e., each dancer is assigned to at least one dancer. The equality 13=left|B_{1}right|+left|B_{2}right|+cdots+left|B_{7}right| implies that B_{1} actually has one element in common with B_{2}, which has one element in common with B_{3}, and so on up to B_{7} (this justifies in particular the fact, used implicitly in the previous description, that none of the sets B_{i} is empty).We also observe that a set B_{i} cannot have 'gaps', i.e., it is formed by a row of adjacent dancers (precisely: if it contains two dancers, it also contains all those between them). Indeed, if two dancers are both assigned to the same dancer, then all the dancers between them can only be assigned to the same dancer (to respect the condition that the segments do not cross). Since we have already observed that each dancer must be assigned to at least one dancer, we conclude as desired that each set B_{i} is made up of adjacent dancers.Based on all these observations, we then obtain that the first dancer is assigned all the dancers from the first to the i_{1}-th (for some i_{1} in{1, ldots, 7}); the second, all those from the i_{1}-th to the i_{2}-th (for some i_{2} in{1, ldots, 7}), and so on up to the seventh dancer, to whom the dancers from i_{6} to i_{7}=7 are assigned. To describe the situation, it is therefore sufficient to know the numbers i_{1} leq i_{2} leq cdots leq i_{6} (since we already know that i_{7}=7). We can think of such a collection of numbers as a function f from {1,2,3,4,5,6} to {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, with the condition that it is weakly increasing, i.e., that f(x+1) geq f(x) for x=1, ldots, 6. Knowing f is then equivalent to knowing the function g that maps x to f(x)+x, which is now strictly increasing (i.e., g(x+1)>g(x)) and takes values in the set {2,3, ldots, 7+6=13}. Finally, given the condition of being strictly increasing, such a function is completely determined by the knowledge of the 6 elements of its image (given 6 distinct numbers in {2, ldots, 13}, there is a unique strictly increasing function {1, ldots, 6} rightarrow{2, ldots, 13} that assumes them as values).

Estimate Total Number of Fish in Pond:   - Assuming the proportion of marked to unmarked fish in the new sample reflects the proportion of marked to unmarked fish in the entire pond, we can set up a proportion to estimate the total number of fish in the pond.   - Since 40 fish were originally marked, and this represents frac{2}{75} of the total population, we can solve for the total population (P) as follows:   40 = P times frac{2}{75}   - Solving for P, we find:   P = 40 div frac{2}{75} = 40 times frac{75}{2} = 1500.Therefore, the estimated number of fish in Xiaoming's pond is boxed{1500} fish."},{"problem":"Given the function f(x) = ax^3 + x + b is an odd function, and the tangent line to the graph of f(x) at the point (1, f(1)) passes through the point (2, 6), find a+b.","solution":"Since the function f(x) = ax^3 + x + b is an odd function, we have f(0) = 0, which implies b = 0.

We start by expressing f(x) = sin x - 2cos x in a form that resembles sin(x - alpha):   [   f(x) = sin x - 2cos x = sqrt{5}left(frac{sqrt{5}}{5}sin x - frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}cos xright)   ]   Here, we factor out sqrt{5} and express the coefficients of sin x and cos x as fractions.2. We recognize this as sqrt{5}sin(x - alpha), where cos alpha = frac{sqrt{5}}{5} and sin alpha = frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}.3. Since f(x) attains its maximum value when x = theta, we have sin(theta - alpha) = 1. This implies sin theta - 2cos theta = sqrt{5}.4. We also know that sin^2theta + cos^2theta = 1.5. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:   [   (2cos theta + sqrt{5})^2 + cos^2theta = 1   ]   Simplifying this equation leads us to cos theta = -frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}.Method 2:1. We express f(x) = sin x - 2cos x as sqrt{5}sin(x + varphi), where tan varphi = -2 and varphi in left(-frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{2}right).2. Since f(x) reaches its maximum when x = theta, we have theta + varphi = frac{pi}{2} + 2kpi for k in mathbb{Z}.3. Therefore, theta = frac{pi}{2} + 2kpi - varphi for k in mathbb{Z}.4. This leads to cos theta = cosleft(frac{pi}{2} + 2kpi - varphiright) = sin varphi = -frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}.Hence, in both methods, we arrive at the conclusion that cos theta = -frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}.

So we know that the minimum positive period should be pi.- To find the symmetry center of the graph, we need to determine a point at which the function value is the same on both sides over the period. One way to do this is to find the maximum value point within one period, which, for a squared trigonometric function, will be at the peak of the sin^2(x) curve. The sine function reaches its peak at frac{pi}{2}, and hence so will sin^2(x) within one period from 0 to pi.Hence, we conclude that the correct answer is:C) The function has a minimum positive period of pi, and one symmetry center of its graph is (frac{pi}{2},0).[boxed{C}]"},{"problem":"[ Pythagorean Theorem (direct and inverse) ] [Auxiliary similar triangles]In a right triangle ABC, AC=16, BC=12.
