[b](N. 9)[/b]","solution":"1. We start by considering the congruence (a^n equiv 1 pmod{p}) and the condition that the least integer solution (n) differs from 6. This implies that the order of (a) modulo (p), denoted (text{ord}_p(a)), is not 6.2. We factorize (a^6 - 1) as follows:   [   a^6 - 1 = (a-1)(a+1)(a^2 + a + 1)(a^2 - a + 1)   ]   If (p) divides (a^6 - 1), then (p) must divide one of these factors.3. We analyze the cases where (p) divides one of the first three factors:   - If (p) divides (a-1), then (a equiv 1 pmod{p}) and (text{ord}_p(a) = 1).   - If (p) divides (a+1), then (a equiv -1 pmod{p}) and (text{ord}_p(a) = 2).   - If (p) divides (a^2 + a + 1), then (text{ord}_p(a) = 3).   In any of these cases, (text{ord}_p(a)) is either 1, 2, or 3, which are all less than 6. Therefore, if (p) divides any of these factors, we are done.4. We now consider the case where (p) divides (a^2 - a + 1). For such primes (p), we must have (p) dividing one of the first three factors, as otherwise (text{ord}_p(a) = 6), which contradicts the problem's condition.5. We perform a case analysis to find such primes (p):   - If (p) divides (a^2 - a + 1), then (a^2 - a + 1 equiv 0 pmod{p}).   - This quadratic equation has discriminant (Delta = (-1)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 1 = -3). For the equation to have integer solutions modulo (p), (-3) must be a quadratic residue modulo (p).6. We check the possible values of (p):   - For (p = 2), (a^2 - a + 1 equiv 0 pmod{2}) simplifies to (a^2 - a + 1 equiv 1 pmod{2}), which is always true since (a^2 - a) is even.   - For (p = 3), (a^2 - a + 1 equiv 0 pmod{3}) simplifies to (a^2 - a + 1 equiv 0 pmod{3}). This equation has solutions modulo 3.7. Since (a^2 - a + 1) is always odd, (p) cannot be 2. Therefore, (p = 3).8. We now solve (a^2 - a + 1 = 3^k) for some integer (k):   - Rewrite the equation as ((2a - 1)^2 = 4 cdot 3^k - 3).   - Clearly, (3) must divide (2a - 1). Let (2a - 1 = 3m) for some integer (m).   - Substituting back, we get ((3m)^2 = 4 cdot 3^k - 3), which simplifies to (9m^2 = 4 cdot 3^k - 3).9. For (k > 1), this equation leads to a contradiction. Therefore, (k = 1):   - For (k = 1), we have (a^2 - a + 1 = 3).   - Solving (a^2 - a - 2 = 0), we get (a = 2) (since (a > 1)).10. For (a = 2), we check (a^6 - 1 = 2^6 - 1 = 63 = 3^2 cdot 7):    - Since (2^2 - 1 = 3) and (2^3 - 1 = 7), it satisfies our hypothesis.Conclusion:(boxed{a = 2}) is the only integer greater than 1 for which the least integer solution (n) of the congruence (a^n equiv 1 pmod{p}) differs from 6."},{"problem":"If the graph of the inverse proportion function y=frac{k}{x}(kneq 0) passes through the point left(2,-1right), then the value of k is ( )A: 2B: -2C: frac{1}{2}D: -frac{1}{2}","solution":"Given the point left(2,-1right) lies on the graph of the inverse proportion function y=frac{k}{x} where kneq 0, we can substitute the coordinates of the point into the equation to find the value of k.

If ifrac{50}{51} and the sum sum_{1}^{100} a_{i}>50 is too large.

We replace a_{1} by a_{2}, then a_{3} by a_{4}, and so on, until we replace a_{99} by a_{100}. At the end of the process we have S geq 25.

Then the condition becomes:   [   0^2 + 0^2 - c^2 mid P(0) + P(0) - P(c) implies -c^2 mid 2P(0) - P(c).   ]   This implies:   [   c^2 mid P(c) - 2P(0).   ]   Therefore, for all integers (c), (c^2) must divide (P(c) - 2P(0)).3. Form of the Polynomial:   Since (c^2 mid P(c) - 2P(0)), we can write:   [   P(c) = 2P(0) + c^2 Q(c),   ]   where (Q(c)) is some polynomial with integer coefficients. 4. Degree Consideration:   Let (P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + cdots + a_1 x + a_0). Given that (c^2 mid P(c) - 2P(0)), the leading term (a_n x^n) must be divisible by (x^2). This implies (n leq 2).5. Case Analysis:   - Case (n = 0): (P(x) = a_0). This is a constant polynomial. For any constant polynomial, (P(a) + P(b) - P(c) = 3a_0 - a_0 = 2a_0), which is not generally divisible by (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) unless (a_0 = 0). Thus, (P(x) = 0).   - Case (n = 1): (P(x) = a_1 x + a_0). For linear polynomials, (P(a) + P(b) - P(c) = a_1(a + b - c) + 2a_0). This is not generally divisible by (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) unless (a_1 = 0) and (a_0 = 0). Thus, (P(x) = 0).   - Case (n = 2): (P(x) = a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0). For quadratic polynomials, we need to check if (a^2 + b^2 - c^2 mid P(a) + P(b) - P(c)). Given (P(x) = dx^2), we have:     [     P(a) + P(b) - P(c) = d(a^2 + b^2 - c^2).     ]     Clearly, (a^2 + b^2 - c^2 mid d(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)) for any integer (d).6. Conclusion:   The only polynomials (P(x)) that satisfy the given condition are of the form (P(x) = dx^2) for some integer (d).The final answer is ( boxed{ P(x) = dx^2 } ) for some integer (d)."},{"problem":"The value of ∫_{ 0 }^{ 1 }x^2dx is (　　)A:  frac {1}{3}  B: 1  C:  frac {1}{2}  D:  frac {2}{3}","solution":"Solution: ∫_{ 0 }^{ 1 }x^2dx = frac {1}{3}x^3|_{ 0 }^{ 1 } = frac {1}{3},  Therefore, the correct answer is: boxed{A}.

Let M be a set of six distinct positive integers whose sum is 60. We will write all of them on the faces of a cube, with exactly one on each face.

Determine the number of all such sets M whose numbers can be written on the faces of the cube in such a way that after a finite number of appropriate steps, the numbers on all faces will be the same.The regional round of category A takes place## on Tuesday, January 18, 2011so that it starts in the morning and the contestants have 4 hours of clean time to solve the problems.

Let the faces of the cube be denoted by S_{1}, S_{2}, ldots, S_{6} such that face S_{1} is opposite to face S_{6}, face S_{2} is opposite to S_{5}, and S_{3} is opposite to S_{4}. Let the number on face S_{i} be denoted by c_{i}. Clearly, any vertex of the cube belongs to exactly one pair of opposite faces. This means that in each step, the value of the sums c_{1}+c_{6}, c_{2}+c_{5}, and c_{3}+c_{4} of the numbers on opposite faces increases by 1. Therefore, if at the end it is to hold that c_{1}=c_{2}=c_{3}=c_{4}=c_{5}=c_{6}, and thus alsoc_{1}+c_{6}=c_{2}+c_{5}=c_{3}+c_{4},the sums of the numbers on opposite faces of the cube must be the same at the beginning (and will remain the same after each step).We will show that condition (1) is also sufficient. Let the numbers on the faces of the cube satisfy (1). We will describe a sequence of steps after which the numbers on all faces of the cube will be the same. Let a step in which we increase the numbers on faces S_{i}, S_{j}, S_{m} be denoted by k_{i j m}. Without loss of generality, let c_{1}=p be the largest of the six numbers on the cube. Now we perform left(p-c_{2}right) times the step k_{246} and left(p-c_{3}right) times the step k_{356}. This will ensure that the numbers on faces S_{1}, S_{2}, S_{3} are the same, namely p. Due to condition (1), the numbers on faces S_{4}, S_{5}, S_{6} will also be the same, let their value be q.

From the possible groups of length 2, the words are not exactly B B (does not contain any A) and A A (is of an impermissible form), so the words are exactly A B and B A. From these, we create impermissible forms of length 3: A B A and B A A. All other groups of length 3 (except B B B) are thus words: A A A, A A B, A B B, B A B, B B A. If we append the letter A to their end, we get five impermissible forms of length 4: A A A A, A A B A, A B B A, B A B A, B B A A. All other groups of length 4 (except B B B B) are thus the sought words: A A A B, A A B B, A B A A, A B A B, A B B B, B A A A, B A A B, B A B B, B B A B, B B B A.b) According to part a), we know that p_{1}=1, p_{2}=2, p_{3}=5, and p_{4}=10. Now, for each n geqq 1, we will express the number p_{n+1} in terms of the number p_{n}. To do this, we will divide all words of length n+1 into two groups depending on the last letter: those of the form ...

B, there are exactly 2^{n}-1 (before the last B stands any group of length n except B B ldots B). Therefore, p_{n+1}=left(2^{n}-p_{n}right)+left(2^{n}-1right)=2^{n+1}-1-p_{n}. From such expressions for p_{n+1} and p_{n+2}, it follows that: p_{n+2}=2^{n+2}-1-p_{n+1}=2^{n+2}-1-left(2^{n+1}-1-p_{n}right)=p_{n}+2^{n+1}. Based on this, we will determine the values of p_{n} separately for even and odd indices n:begin{aligned}p_{2 k-1} & =p_{2 k-3}+2^{2 k-2}=p_{2 k-5}+2^{2 k-4}+2^{2 k-2}=cdots=p_{1}+2^{2}+2^{4}+cdots+2^{2 k-4}+2^{2 k-2}= & =1+4+4^{2}+cdots+4^{k-2}+4^{k-1}=frac{4^{k}-1}{3}, p_{2 k} & =p_{2 k-2}+2^{2 k-1}=p_{2 k-4}+2^{2 k-3}+2^{2 k-1}=cdots=p_{2}+2^{3}+2^{5}+cdots+2^{2 k-3}+2^{2 k-1}= & =2+2 cdot 4^{1}+2 cdot 4^{2}+cdots+2 cdot 4^{k-2}+2 cdot 4^{k-1}=frac{2 cdotleft(4^{k}-1right)}{3} .end{aligned}The found formulas hold for any k geqq 1.

Extend the given triangle to form parallelogram A B C D and draw segment K N parallel to B C (see left figure). Then C N=C D-D N=A B-A K=B C-C L=A L. Triangles N C L and L A K are congruent by two sides and the included angle. Therefore, N L=L K. Moreover, angle N L A=angle L K B, as these are corresponding exterior angles in congruent triangles.Thus, angle N L K=angle A L K+angle N L A=angle A L K+angle L K B=60^{circ}, meaning triangle K L N is equilateral. Hence, K L=K N=B C.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_6409e68af5a1ba5e989dg-49.jpg?height=572&width=1226&top_left_y=1166&top_left_x=424)Second method. Draw lines through points K and L parallel to B C, intersecting A C and A B at points M and N respectively (see right figure). Then K M L N is an isosceles trapezoid, so M N=K L and angle M N K=angle M L K.Let P be the intersection of the diagonals of the trapezoid, thenangle N P L=angle P N K+angle N K P=angle A L K+angle L K B=60^{circ}.Draw a line through point M parallel to K L, intersecting line N L at point Q. Then in triangle M N Q, M N=M Q and angle Q M N=60^{circ}, so this triangle is equilateral. Therefore, M Q=N Q, thus K L=N L+L Q=N L+K M.Draw the midline E F of triangle A B C, which will also be the midline of trapezoid K M L N (since A M=A K=C L=B N).

The Cavalieri principle used can be stated intuitively as follows: if two solids can be placed in space such that when cut by planes parallel to a suitably positioned plane, the areas of the sections in any plane are equal, then the volumes of the two solids are equal. (The mentioned placement merely facilitates the correspondence of the sections.) A beautiful example of such a pair of solids is a hemisphere of radius r and a cylinder of radius r and height r from which a cone has been cut out, whose base circle is the top face of the cylinder, and whose vertex is the center of the bottom face.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_b9853616a2374cfe3ec9g-1.jpg?height=464&width=1178&top_left_y=2179&top_left_x=454)Figure 23. The above solutions calculated the volume of the solid under the assumption that the sought solid has a volume. Determining or proving that the solid indeed has a volume was not the task of the contestants. The wording of the problem also suggested that the volume exists, and only the value of the volume needed to be determined. However, we would like to emphasize that if we use one of the above methods to determine the volume of a solid, we do not claim that the volume of the solid is this and this, but only that if the solid has a volume, then it can only be this much.Most of our readers were probably surprised to read these lines, as they have not heard that a solid might not have a volume. This, of course, depends on what we mean by a solid and what we mean by volume. School education does not address this. In this regard, we provide an example of a solid that does not have a volume.Consider a unit cube, and among the plane sections parallel to the base ABCD, translate those whose distance from the base is a rational number by the vector AB. The resulting so-called \\"riddled cube\\" has every plane section parallel to ABCD as a unit square, so each has an area of one unit, and the solid does not have a volume."},{"problem":"(5 points) Xiaoying says, \\"For any natural number n, (n+7)^2-(n-5)^2 can be divided by 24.\\" Do you agree with her statement?

Since c sin A = sqrt{3} a cos C, by the sine law we have sin C sin A = sqrt{3} sin A cos C. As sin A neq 0, we can divide both sides by sin A to get sin C = sqrt{3} cos C. Thus, tan C = frac{sin C}{cos C} = sqrt{3}. Since C in (0, pi), we have C = frac{pi}{3}.2. Given that sin C + sin (B - A) = 5 sin 2A, and sin C = sin(A + B) (since A, B, and C are angles of a triangle), we have sin(A + B) + sin(B - A) = 5 sin 2A.

Justify your answer.","solution":"To find all positive integer pairs ((m, n)) such that (m - n) is a positive prime number and (mn) is a perfect square, we will analyze the given conditions step by step.1. Condition Analysis:   - (m - n) is a positive prime number, say (p).   - (mn) is a perfect square.2. Case 1: (m - n = 2):   - If (m - n = 2), then (m = n + 2).   - For (mn) to be a perfect square, both (m) and (n) must share the same prime factors in such a way that their product is a perfect square.   - If both (m) and (n) are odd, their difference (2) cannot be a prime number since the difference of two odd numbers is even and greater than 2.   - If both (m) and (n) are even, then (m) and (n) must be divisible by 2. However, for (mn) to be a perfect square, they must share more factors, which is not possible with a difference of 2.3. Case 2: (m - n = p) where (p) is an odd prime:   - Let (m = n + p).   - For (mn) to be a perfect square, (m) and (n) must be such that their product is a perfect square.   - Consider (m = x^2) and (n = y^2) where (x) and (y) are integers. Then (x^2 - y^2 = p).   - Factoring the difference of squares, we get ((x - y)(x + y) = p).4. Prime Factorization:   - Since (p) is a prime number, the only factor pairs are ((1, p)) and ((p, 1)).   - Therefore, (x - y = 1) and (x + y = p).5. Solving the System of Equations:   - From (x - y = 1) and (x + y = p), we can solve for (x) and (y):     [     x - y = 1 quad text{(1)}     ]     [     x + y = p quad text{(2)}     ]   - Adding equations (1) and (2):     [     2x = p + 1 implies x = frac{p + 1}{2}     ]   - Subtracting equation (1) from (2):     [     2y = p - 1 implies y = frac{p - 1}{2}     ]6. Verification:   - For (x) and (y) to be integers, (p + 1) and (p - 1) must both be even, which is true since (p) is an odd prime.   - Therefore, (x = frac{p + 1}{2}) and (y = frac{p - 1}{2}) are integers.7. Constructing (m) and (n):   - (m = x^2 = left(frac{p + 1}{2}right)^2)   - (n = y^2 = left(frac{p - 1}{2}right)^2)8.

Determine all positive integers n such that d(n) +d(n+ 1) = 5.","solution":"1. We need to find all positive integers ( n ) such that ( d(n) + d(n+1) = 5 ), where ( d(m) ) denotes the number of positive divisors of ( m ).2. First, note that ( d(n) geq 2 ) for any positive integer ( n ) because ( n ) has at least two divisors: 1 and ( n ) itself.3. Since ( d(n) + d(n+1) = 5 ), the possible pairs ((d(n), d(n+1))) are ((2, 3)) and ((3, 2)) because these are the only pairs of positive integers that sum to 5 and are greater than or equal to 2.4. If ( d(n) = 2 ), then ( n ) must be a prime number because only prime numbers have exactly two divisors (1 and the number itself).5. If ( d(n+1) = 3 ), then ( n+1 ) must be the square of a prime number because a number with exactly three divisors must be of the form ( p^2 ), where ( p ) is a prime. This is because the divisors of ( p^2 ) are ( 1, p, ) and ( p^2 ).6. Conversely, if ( d(n) = 3 ), then ( n ) must be the square of a prime number, and if ( d(n+1) = 2 ), then ( n+1 ) must be a prime number.7. Let's consider the case where ( n ) is a prime number and ( n+1 = p^2 ) for some prime ( p ):   - If ( n ) is prime, then ( n = p^2 - 1 ).   - We need to find ( p ) such that ( p^2 - 1 ) is prime.   - For ( p = 2 ), ( p^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 ), which is prime. Thus, ( n = 3 ).8. Now, let's consider the case where ( n = p^2 ) for some prime ( p ) and ( n+1 ) is prime:   - If ( n = p^2 ), then ( n+1 = p^2 + 1 ).   - We need to find ( p ) such that ( p^2 + 1 ) is prime.   - For ( p = 2 ), ( p^2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 ), which is prime. Thus, ( n = 4 ).9.

Next, we will prove that in any desired set, there must be exactly one card from each such pair, i.e., ( k = 512 ).From the condition, it follows that at most one card from each pair can be among the selected ones. Now we will show that at least one card from each pair must be included.Consider a pair of complementary cards, denoted as ( A ) and ( B ). Suppose neither of them is in the selected set.

Adding card ( A ) to the set, we will find several cards that complement ( A ) to a complete set, i.e., all the digits on these cards simply match the set of digits on card ( B ). Similarly, adding card ( B ), we will find several cards from the set whose digits match the set of digits on card ( A ).

Then, we have x_1 + x_2 = 2m + 4.Given that |AF| + |BF| = 10, and considering the distance from the focus to any point on the parabola is given by the x-coordinate of the point (since the focus of y^2 = 4x is (1,0)), we have:[x_1 + x_2 + 2 = 10][⇒ x_1 + x_2 = 8]Setting x_1 + x_2 = 2m + 4 = 8, we find m = 2.Therefore, the coordinates of point P are boxed{(2,0)}.(2) From the previous part, we have the system of equations:[left{begin{array}{l}x_1 + x_2 = 2m + 4 x_1 x_2 = m^2end{array}right.]Given |AB| = 12sqrt{2}, we can express |AB| as sqrt{2}|x_1 - x_2|, which leads to:[|AB| = sqrt{2}sqrt{(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2} = sqrt{2}sqrt{16m + 16} = 12sqrt{2}]Solving for m in sqrt{2}sqrt{16m + 16} = 12sqrt{2} gives m = 8.With m = 8, the equation of line l_{AB} becomes y = x - 8.

Let f(0) = b, f(1) = a+b. Putting y = -x, we get f(x) + f(-x) = 2b. Replacing x by 2x, and y by -x, we get 2f(2x) + f(-x) = 3f(x). Hence f(2x) = 2f(x) - b. We conjecture that f(nx) = nf(x) - (n-1)b. Suppose true for n. Then nf(nx) - f(x) = (n-1)f((n+1)x), so f((n+1)x) = (n+1)f(x) - nb. So the result is true for all positive integers n. But f(-nx) = 2b - f(nx) = -nf(x) - (-nb - 1). So the result is true for all integers n. Taking x = 1/n, we get a+b = nf(1/n) - (n-1)b, so f(1/n) = a(1/n) + b. Hence f(m/n) = m(a(1/n) + b) - (m- 1)b = a(m/n) + b. Put g(x) = f(x) - b. Then xg(x) - yg(y) = xf(x) - yf(y) - (x-y)b, and (x-y)g(x+y) = (x-y)f(x+y) - (x-y)b. So xg(x) - yg(y) = (x-y)g(x+y) (*). Also g(-x) = -g(x). So putting -y for y in (*) we get xg(x) - yg(y) = (x+y)g(x-y). Hence g(x+y)/(x+y) = g(x-y)/(x-y) for all x, y. Now given any k ≠ 1, put x = (k+1)/2, y = (k-1)/2. Then x+y = k, x-y = 1, so g(k)/k = g(1) = a.

A completely different approach is needed.Assume that the natural numbers a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{n} (where mu is also unknown) sum to 1983, and their product P is maximized. Since for x geqslant 4,2(x-2) geqslant x,we can assume that a_{i} leq 3 for i=1,2, cdots, n, otherwise we can replace two numbers a_{1}, a_{2} with one number 1 + a_{1}, keeping the sum as 1983 while increasing the product P.Thus, a_{i} can only be 2 or 3 for i=1,2, cdots, n. Note that2 times 2 times 2 < 3 times 3,so there can be at most two 2s in a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{n}, otherwise we can replace 2, 2, 2 with 3, 3, keeping the sum as 1983 while increasing the product P.

Since y increases as x increases beyond x = 1, and given the positions of B and C at x = 2 and x = 4 respectively, we can infer the following about their y-values:    - y_3 (at x = 4) is greater than y_1 (at x = -1 or its symmetric point x = 3) because 4 > 3 and y increases with x for x > 1.    - y_1 is greater than y_2 (at x = 2) because 2 > 1 and y increases with x for x > 1, but 2 is closer to the axis of symmetry than 3, meaning y at x = 2 is less than y at x = 3.Therefore, the relationship between y_1, y_2, and y_3 is y_3 > y_1 > y_2.Hence, the correct answer is boxed{text{A}}."},{"problem":"Given a parallelogram ABCD, where AB=5, AD=2sqrt{3}+2, and angle BAD=30^{circ}.

Let Sasha put x g of salt in the soup yesterday, and added y g. Then today he put 2x g, and added -0.5y g. According to the condition: x + y = 2x + 0.5y, so x = 0.5y.

Understanding the Problem:   - We need to ensure that in any subset ( A ) of size ( f(n) ), there are three elements ( x, y, z ) that are pairwise coprime.   - Two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 1.2. Counting Non-Coprime Pairs:   - Consider the set ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ).   - We need to count the number of elements that are multiples of 2, 3, and 6 (since 6 is the least common multiple of 2 and 3).3. Using the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:   - Let ( A_2 ) be the set of multiples of 2 in ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ).   - Let ( A_3 ) be the set of multiples of 3 in ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ).   - Let ( A_6 ) be the set of multiples of 6 in ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ).

Ensuring Pairwise Coprime Elements:   - To ensure that there are three pairwise coprime elements in any subset of size ( f(n) ), we need to add 1 to the above count to account for the worst-case scenario where all elements are multiples of 2 or 3.   - Therefore, the least number ( f(n) ) is:   [   f(n) = leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{3} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{n}{6} rightrfloor + 1   ]The final answer is ( boxed{leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{3} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{n}{6} rightrfloor + 1} )."},{"problem":"7.

The cube is cut into 64 smaller cubes of equal size, so there are 64 possible outcomes.Next, we need to determine the number of smaller cubes that have exactly two painted faces. These cubes will be located at the edges of the original cube, as they are the only ones that will have exactly two painted faces.Each edge of the cube contains two smaller cubes with exactly two painted faces (one at each end). Since there are 12 edges on a cube, there are 2 times 12 = 24 smaller cubes with exactly two painted faces.Using the classical probability formula, the probability P is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes. In this case, P = frac{24}{64} = boxed{frac{3}{8}}.This problem primarily tests the understanding of classical probability and the structure of a cube.

An alternating number is defined as a number where every two consecutive digits have different parity (one is even, the other is odd). Case 1: (gcd(n, 10) = 1)If ( n ) is relatively prime to 10, we can find an alternating multiple of ( n ). Consider the number ( 1010101ldots101 ), which can be written as:[frac{10^{2k} - 1}{99}]for some integer ( k ). This number is alternating and we need to show that it is a multiple of ( n ). Since ( gcd(n, 10) = 1 ), there exists some ( k ) such that ( 99n mid 10^{2k} - 1 ). Therefore, ( n ) has an alternating multiple. Case 2: ( n ) is a power of 5We will show by induction that there exists an alternating multiple of ( 5^k ) with exactly ( k ) digits.Base cases:- ( 5 ): The number 5 itself is alternating.- ( 25 ): The number 25 is alternating.- ( 125 ): The number 125 is alternating.- ( 625 ): The number 625 is alternating.- ( 3125 ): The number 3125 is alternating.Inductive step:Suppose ( 5^k ) has an alternating multiple with ( k ) digits. We need to show that ( 5^{k+1} ) has an alternating multiple with ( k+1 ) digits. Let ( m ) be the alternating multiple of ( 5^k ). We need to find a digit ( d ) such that:[10^k cdot d equiv -m pmod{5^{k+1}}]Since ( -m equiv {0, 5^k, 2 cdot 5^k, 3 cdot 5^k, 4 cdot 5^k} pmod{5^{k+1}} ), we can choose ( d ) such that ( 10^k cdot d equiv -m pmod{5^{k+1}} ). This completes the induction. Case 3: ( n ) is a power of 5 times something relatively prime to 10Suppose ( n = 5^k cdot l ) where ( gcd(l, 10) = 1 ). If ( k ) is odd, consider an alternating multiple of ( 5^{k+1} ) with ( k+1 ) digits. If ( k ) is even, consider an alternating multiple of ( 5^k ) with ( k ) digits.We know ( l ) has a multiple of the form:[frac{10^{kd} - 1}{10^k - 1}]which is alternating. If ( k ) is even, multiply this number by the alternating multiple of ( 5^k ). If ( k ) is odd, replace ( k ) with ( k+1 ) and multiply by ( 5^{k+1} ). Case 4: ( n ) is 10 times an odd numberIf ( n = 10m ) where ( m ) is odd, take the alternating multiple of ( m ) and place a 0 at the end. This ensures the number is still alternating. Case 5: ( n ) is a power of 2We will show by induction that there exists an alternating multiple of ( 2^k ) with ( k ) digits.Base cases:- ( 2 ): The number 2 itself is alternating.- ( 4 ): The number 24 is alternating.- ( 8 ): The number 248 is alternating.- ( 16 ): The number 24816 is alternating.Inductive step:Suppose we have an alternating multiple of ( 2^{k+2} ) with ( k ) digits, where ( k ) is even.

Let angle C B D=alpha, angle C D B=beta, alpha+beta=90^{circ} (see Fig. 11.6a). Right triangles D B C and A B C share the side B C. If angle A B C=alpha, then triangles A B C and D B C are congruent, which implies C D=A C, which is impossible because A C is the hypotenuse of the right triangle A C D.Therefore, angle A B C=beta, angle B A C=alpha. Since B A C is the angle between the line A B and the plane A C D, then alphaC D, hence C DA D.Therefore, angle B A D=beta, quad angle A B D=alpha, quad then A D=cos beta; C D=B D cos beta=A B cos alpha cos beta=cos alpha cos beta. Thus, C D<A D.From triangle A C D: C D<A D and alpha<beta. Therefore, angle C A D=alpha. From triangle A B C and triangle A B D: A D=A C cos alpha=A B cos ^{2} alpha. From triangle A B D quad A D=A B cos beta. We obtain the equation: cos beta=cos ^{2} alpha.Since alpha+beta=90^{circ}, then cos beta=sin alpha. The obtained equation becomes: sin alpha=1-sin ^{2} alpha. Introducing the notation sin alpha=t, where 0<t<1, we get the quadratic equation t^{2}+t-1=0, whose roots are t_{1}=frac{-1-sqrt{5}}{2}<0 and t_{2}=frac{-1+sqrt{5}}{2}, 0<t_{2}<1. Therefore, sin alpha=frac{sqrt{5}-1}{2}.Since cos beta=sin alpha, then C D=cos alpha cos beta=cos alpha sin alpha. Moreover, sin alpha=cos ^{2} alpha, and the angle alpha is acute, so sqrt{sin alpha}=cos alpha. Thus, C D=left(frac{sqrt{5}-1}{2}right)^{frac{3}{2}}.For a series of calculations (for example, to determine the arrangement of planar angles at vertex A), the formula of three cosines can be used. Let the line B C be perpendicular to the plane A C D, angle B A C=alpha, angle C A D=beta, quad angle B A D=varphi quad (see Fig. 11.6b).

We need to compare ( A = frac{x}{(x-1)^2 + x} ) and ( B = frac{y}{(y-1)^2 + y} ).3.

A natural number s is called n-decomposable if the sum s can be paid with coins of denominations 2^{n}, 2^{n-1} cdot 3, ldots, 3^{n} piastres, and n-indecomposable otherwise. For n=1, only coins of 2 and 3 piastres are available. If s geqslant 3, there exists an r in{0,1} such that (s-3 r) is even. Then s can be expressed as 3 r+2 k, meaning it is 1-decomposable.

Determine the condition for the angles:   We require:   [   sum theta equiv pi mod 2pi   ]   Let ( z = e^{ipi/4} ). The angles we have available are ( {z^1, z^2, z^3, z^5, z^6, z^7} ). We must choose exactly 8 angles from the set ( {z^2, z^6} ) and exactly 4 from the set ( {z^1, z^3, z^5, z^7} ).4. Count the number of good combinations:   If we found a good combination where we had ( a_i ) of each angle ( z^i ), then the amount this would contribute to our count would be:   [   binom{12}{4,8} cdot binom{8}{a_2, a_6} cdot binom{4}{a_1, a_3, a_5, a_7}   ]   We want to add these all up. We proceed by generating functions.5. Generating function approach:   Consider:   [   (t_2x^2 + t_6x^6)^8 (t_1x^1 + t_3x^3 + t_5x^5 + t_7x^7)^4   ]   The expansion will be of the form:   [   sum_i left( sum_{sum a = i} binom{8}{a_2, a_6} binom{4}{a_1, a_3, a_5, a_7} t_1^{a_1} t_2^{a_2} t_3^{a_3} t_5^{a_5} t_6^{a_6} t_7^{a_7} x^i right)   ]   Note that if we reduced the powers of ( x ) mod ( 8 ) and fished out the coefficient of ( x^4 ) and plugged in ( t_i = 1  forall , i ) (and then multiplied by ( binom{12}{4,8} )), then we would be done. Since plugging in ( t_i = 1 ) doesn't affect the ( x )'s, we do that right away. The expression then becomes:   [   x^{20}(1 + x^4)^8 (1 + x^2 + x^4 + x^6)^4 = x^{20}(1 + x^4)^{12}(1 + x^2)^4 = x^4(1 + x^4)^{12}(1 + x^2)^4   ]   where the last equality is true because we are taking the powers of ( x ) mod ( 8 ).6. Roots of unity filter:   Let ( [x^n]f(x) ) denote the coefficient of ( x^n ) in ( f(x) ). Note:   [   [x^4] x^4(1 + x^4)^{12}(1 + x^2)^4 = [x^0](1 + x^4)^{12}(1 + x^2)^4   ]   We use the roots of unity filter, which states:   [   text{terms of } f(x) text{ that have exponent congruent to } k text{ mod } n = frac{1}{n} sum_{m=1}^n frac{f(z^m x)}{z^{mk}}   ]   where ( z = e^{ipi/n} ). In our case ( k = 0 ), so we only need to find the average of the ( f(z^m x) )'s.7. Evaluate the roots of unity filter:   [   begin{align*}   z^0 &Longrightarrow (1 + x^4)^{12}(1 + x^2)^4,    z^1 &Longrightarrow (1 - x^4)^{12}(1 + ix^2)^4,    z^2 &Longrightarrow (1 + x^4)^{12}(1 - x^2)^4,    z^3 &Longrightarrow (1 - x^4)^{12}(1 - ix^2)^4,    z^4 &Longrightarrow (1 + x^4)^{12}(1 + x^2)^4,    z^5 &Longrightarrow (1 - x^4)^{12}(1 + ix^2)^4,    z^6 &Longrightarrow (1 + x^4)^{12}(1 - x^2)^4,    z^7 &Longrightarrow (1 - x^4)^{12}(1 - ix^2)^4.   end{align*}   ]   We plug in ( x = 1 ) and take the average to find the sum of all coefficients of ( x^{text{multiple of 8}} ). Plugging in ( x = 1 ) makes all of the above zero except for ( z^0 ) and ( z^4 ). Averaging, we get ( 2^{14} ).8. Calculate the final probability:   The total number of ways to choose 12 complex numbers is ( 6^{12} ). The number of good combinations is:   [   frac{binom{12}{4,8}}{6^{12}} cdot 2^{14}   ]   Simplifying:   [   binom{12}{4,8} = frac{12!}{4!8!} = frac{12 cdot 11 cdot 10 cdot 9}{4 cdot 3 cdot 2 cdot 1} = 495   ]   Thus, the probability is:   [   frac{495 cdot 2^{14}}{6^{12}} = frac{495 cdot 2^{14}}{2^{12} cdot 3^{12}} = frac{495 cdot 2^2}{3^{12}} = frac{495 cdot 4}{3^{12}} = frac{1980}{3^{12}} = frac{2^2 cdot 5 cdot 11}{3^{10}}   ]The final answer is (boxed{frac{2^2 cdot 5 cdot 11}{3^{10}}})"},{"problem":"# Problem 5.

Find the radius of circle O_{3}.#","solution":"# Answer: 2## Solution:We will solve the problem in general for all cases, specifically proving that if the radius of circle O_{4} is R, then the radius of circle O_{3} is frac{R}{3}.Since circles O_{1} and O_{2} pass through the center of circle O_{4} and are internally tangent to it, for each of them, the center of circle O_{4} is diametrically opposite to the point of tangency. This means that the radius of each of them is frac{R}{2}. Additionally, they touch each other at the center of circle O_{4}, which means that the centers of all three circles lie on the same straight line.Now consider the triangle formed by the centers of circles O_{1} and O_{2} (let's call them A and B) and the point of tangency of circles O_{2} and O_{3} (let's call it C). By symmetry, it is clear that A C = B C. Moreover, point O (the center of circle O_{4}) is the midpoint of side A B. Therefore, triangle O A C is a right triangle, with O A = frac{R}{2} and O C = R.Now consider point X (the center of circle O_{3}). It lies on segment O C, so triangle O A X is also a right triangle.

Let P be any point on the ellipse, and the coordinates of point M are left(6,4right). Find the maximum value of |PM|+|PF_{1}|.","solution":"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the properties of an ellipse and the given information. The ellipse is defined by the equation frac{{x}^{2}}{25}+frac{{y}^{2}}{16}=1, and we are given the coordinates of point M as (6,4). We are also given that F_{2}, the right focus of the ellipse, has coordinates (3,0), and the distance between M and F_{2} is |MF_{2}|=5.1. Identify the major axis length: The major axis length of the ellipse is 2a, where a is the semi-major axis. From the equation of the ellipse, we find that a=5, so 2a=10.2. Apply the property of an ellipse: For any point P on the ellipse, the sum of the distances from P to the two foci F_{1} and F_{2} is constant and equal to the length of the major axis, 2a. Therefore, we have |PF_{1}| + |PF_{2}| = 2a = 10.3. Express |PM| + |PF_{1}| in terms of known quantities: We want to find the maximum value of |PM| + |PF_{1}|. Using the property from step 2, we can express |PF_{1}| as 10 - |PF_{2}|. Therefore, |PM| + |PF_{1}| = |PM| + 10 - |PF_{2}|.4. Analyze the expression: We observe that |PM| - |PF_{2}| can be interpreted as the difference in distances from point M to points P and F_{2}. Since |MF_{2}| = 5, we can add this to both sides of the inequality to get |PM| - |PF_{2}| + |MF_{2}| leqslant |MF_{2}|.5. Apply the triangle inequality: The expression |PM| - |PF_{2}| + |MF_{2}| can be seen as part of the triangle inequality, which implies that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than or equal to the third side. Therefore, we have |PM| + 10 - |PF_{2}| leqslant 10 + |MF_{2}|.6. Substitute the value of |MF_{2}|: Knowing that |MF_{2}| = 5, we substitute this into the inequality to get |PM| + 10 - |PF_{2}| leqslant 10 + 5 = 15.7. Determine the maximum value: The maximum value of |PM| + |PF_{1}| is achieved when the inequality becomes an equality, which happens when points P, F_{2}, and M are collinear.

Then PN = NQ, and MN = c (since PN and NQ are both radii, △PQM is isosceles).So, PN = NQ = sqrt {( frac {b^{2}}{a})^{2}-c^{2}}. Since ∠PMQ is obtuse, ∠PMN = ∠QMN > 45°.

The distance from ( P ) to the line ( y = bx ) is given by the formula for the distance from a point to a line:   [   overline{PH} = frac{|bx - ax^2|}{sqrt{b^2 + 1}}   ]3.

Understanding the problem: We need to find the sum of the remainders when (i^p) is divided by (p^2) for (i) ranging from 1 to (p-1), where (p) is an odd prime.2. Using Fermat's Little Theorem: Fermat's Little Theorem states that for any integer (a) and a prime (p), (a^p equiv a pmod{p}). However, we need to consider the expression modulo (p^2).3. Binomial Expansion: Consider the binomial expansion of ((p+k)^p):   [   (p+k)^p = sum_{j=0}^{p} binom{p}{j} p^{p-j} k^j   ]   Since (p) is a prime, all binomial coefficients (binom{p}{j}) for (1 leq j leq p-1) are divisible by (p). Therefore, modulo (p^2), we have:   [   (p+k)^p equiv p^p + k^p pmod{p^2}   ]   Since (p^p) is clearly divisible by (p^2) (as (p geq 2)), we get:   [   (p+k)^p equiv k^p pmod{p^2}   ]4. Symmetry in the Remainders: Notice that for each (i) in ({1, 2, ldots, p-1}), the remainder (r_i) of (i^p) modulo (p^2) is the same as the remainder of ((p-i)^p) modulo (p^2). This is because:   [   (p-i)^p equiv -i^p pmod{p^2}   ]   Since (p) is odd, (-i^p equiv p^2 - i^p pmod{p^2}).5. Summing the Remainders: We need to sum the remainders (r_i) for (i) from 1 to (p-1).

Over all four-digit positive integers n, which value of n maximizes the ratio frac{s(n)}{n}?[i]Proposed by Michael Tang[/i]","solution":"1. Let ( n ) be a four-digit number, so ( 1000 leq n leq 9999 ).2. Let ( s(n) ) be the sum of the digits of ( n ). We want to maximize the ratio ( frac{s(n)}{n} ).3. Consider the effect of increasing ( s(n) ) by 1. This can be done by increasing one of the digits of ( n ) by 1, which increases ( n ) by 1, 10, 100, or 1000 depending on the position of the digit.4. We need to compare ( frac{s(n)+1}{n+a} ) with ( frac{s(n)}{n} ), where ( a ) is 1, 10, 100, or 1000.5. The inequality ( frac{s(n)+1}{n+a} > frac{s(n)}{n} ) simplifies to:   [   (s(n)+1)n > s(n)(n+a)   ]   [   s(n)n + n > s(n)n + s(n)a   ]   [   n > s(n)a   ]6. For ( a = 1 ), the inequality ( n > s(n) ) must hold. Since ( s(n) leq 36 ) (the maximum sum of digits for a four-digit number), this inequality is always true for four-digit numbers.7. For ( a = 10 ), the inequality ( n > 10s(n) ) must hold. This is not always true for four-digit numbers.8. For ( a = 100 ), the inequality ( n > 100s(n) ) must hold. This is not true for any four-digit number since ( s(n) geq 1 ) and ( n leq 9999 ).9. Therefore, the value of ( n ) that maximizes ( frac{s(n)}{n} ) must be no greater than ( 1000 + 100 = 1100 ).10. To find the exact value, we need to check the values of ( n ) close to 1000 and 1100. The sum of the digits of 1000 is 1, and the sum of the digits of 1099 is 19.11. Calculate the ratios:    [    frac{s(1000)}{1000} = frac{1}{1000} = 0.001    ]    [    frac{s(1099)}{1099} = frac{19}{1099} approx 0.0173    ]12.

Let line MA_{1} intersect the y-axis at point P, and line MA_{2} intersect the y-axis at point Q. If overrightarrow{PB}=λoverrightarrow{BQ}, find the range of real number lambda.","solution":"1. Finding the Standard Equation of Ellipse CGiven that the center of the ellipse C is at the origin O, and one of its foci F is at (sqrt{3},0). This implies that the distance from the center to a focus, denoted as c, is sqrt{3}. Therefore, we have c=sqrt{3}. The semi-major axis is denoted as a, and the semi-minor axis is denoted as b. The relationship between a, b, and c for an ellipse is given by c^2 = a^2 - b^2. Since c=sqrt{3}, we have:[c^2 = 3 = a^2 - b^2][a^2 = b^2 + 3]Given that the area of triangle OFB is frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, and knowing that the area of a triangle is given by frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}, we can deduce that:[frac{1}{2} times a times b = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}][ab = sqrt{3}]Solving the system of equations a^2 = b^2 + 3 and ab = sqrt{3}, we find:[a = 2, quad b = 1]Therefore, the standard equation of the ellipse C is:[frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1][boxed{frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1}]2. Finding the Coordinates of Point MLet M(x_0, y_0) where x_0 > 0 and y_0 > 0. The points A_1 and A_2 are at (-2,0) and (2,0) respectively. Given that M lies on the ellipse, we have:[frac{x_0^2}{4} + y_0^2 = 1]The slopes of lines MA_1 and MA_2 are given as k_1 and k_2 respectively, with k_1 + k_2 = -frac{3}{4}. The slope of a line through two points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) is given by frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}. Therefore, we have:[frac{y_0}{x_0 + 2} + frac{y_0}{x_0 - 2} = -frac{3}{4}]Solving these equations, we find:[x_0 = frac{6}{5}, quad y_0 = frac{4}{5}]Therefore, the coordinates of point M are:[boxed{Mleft(frac{6}{5}, frac{4}{5}right)}]3. Finding the Range of Real Number lambdaThe equation of line MA_1 can be written as y = k_1(x + 2), which gives the y-intercept at point P(0, 2k_1). Similarly, the equation of line MA_2 is y = k_2(x - 2), giving the y-intercept at point Q(0, -2k_2). Given point B(0,1), we have:[overrightarrow{PB} = (0, 1 - 2k_1), quad overrightarrow{BQ} = (0, -1 - 2k_2)]Since overrightarrow{PB} = lambdaoverrightarrow{BQ}, we get:[lambda = frac{1 - 2k_1}{-1 - 2k_2}]Also, given that k_1k_2 = -frac{1}{4}, we find:[lambda = 2k_1]Since k_1 = sqrt{frac{1}{2 + x_0} - frac{1}{4}} and x_0 in (0, 2), we have k_1 in (0, frac{1}{2}). Therefore, the range of lambda is:[boxed{lambda in (0, 1)}]"},{"problem":"The \\"Digital China Development Report (2022)\\" released by the National Internet Information Office on May 23, 2023, shows that the scale of China's digital economy reached 502,000 billion yuan in 2022.

This function is twice differentiable on [0,1] and has three distinct zeros, a, b, and x. By applying Rolle's theorem twice, it follows that g'' has a zero theta in the open interval (0,1). It follows that f(x) = frac{1}{2}(x-a)(x-b) f''(theta), so |f(x)| leq frac{1}{2}|x-a| cdot |x-b|, a relation clearly true also for x=a and x=b.

From the continuity of the functions in mathcal{C}, it follows that the functions f that achieve equality are those for which |f(x)| = x^2 / 2, 0 leq x leq 1, or |f(x)| = (1-x)^2 / 2, 0 leq x leq 1. Therefore, the required functions are f_1(x) = x^2 / 2, f_2(x) = (1-x)^2 / 2 and their opposites.Remark. The function g comes from the following Lagrange interpolation. Let n be a positive integer, let a_0 < a_1 < cdots < a_n be points in an interval I subseteq mathbb{R}, and let f be a real function differentiable n times on I. Thenf^{(n)}(theta) = n! sum_{i=0}^{n} f(a_i) prod_{j neq i} frac{1}{a_i - a_j}where theta is an interior point of I. In particular, if f vanishes at n of the a_i's, e.g., at a_0, ldots, a_{k-1}, a_{k+1}, ldots, a_n, thenf(a_k) = frac{1}{n!} f^{(n)}(theta) prod_{j neq k} (a_k - a_j)To prove (), consider the real function g defined on I,g(x) = f(x) - sum_{i=0}^{n} f(a_i) prod_{j neq i} frac{x - a_j}{a_i - a_j} = f(x) - left( sum_{i=0}^{n} f(a_i) prod_{j neq i} frac{1}{a_i - a_j} right) x^n + cdotsThis function is differentiable n times on I and has n+1 distinct zeros in I, namely, a_0, a_1, ldots, a_n. According to Rolle's theorem, g' has n distinct zeros in the interior of I, one in each of the open intervals (a_i, a_{i+1}), i=0, ldots, n-1. Applying Rolle's theorem to the derivative g', it follows that g'' has n-1 distinct zeros in the interior of I, and so on. Finally, g^{(n)} has a zero theta in the interior of I, from which the conclusion follows."},{"problem":"## Task ConditionFind the derivative.y=sin sqrt[3]{operatorname{tg} 2}-frac{cos ^{2} 28 x}{56 sin 56 x}","solution":"## Solutionbegin{aligned}& y^{prime}=left(sin sqrt[3]{tan 2}-frac{cos ^{2} 28 x}{56 sin 56 x}right)^{prime}=0-left(frac{cos ^{2} 28 x}{56 sin 56 x}right)^{prime}= & =-left(frac{cos ^{2} 28 x}{112 sin 28 x cdot cos 28 x}right)^{prime}=-left(frac{cos 28 x}{112 sin 28 x}right)^{prime}= & =-frac{1}{112} cdot(cot 28 x)^{prime}=-frac{1}{112} cdot frac{-1}{sin ^{2} 28 x} cdot 28= & =frac{1}{4 sin ^{2} 28 x}end{aligned}Problem Kuznetsov Differentiation 9-28"},{"problem":"Given m and n are two lines, and alpha and beta are two planes, consider the following propositions:  ① If n perp alpha and n perp beta, then alpha parallel beta;  ② If there are three non-collinear points on plane alpha that are equidistant from plane beta, then alpha parallel beta;  ③ If n and m are skew lines with n subset alpha, n parallel beta, m subset beta, and m parallel alpha, then alpha parallel beta.

Understanding the Problem:   - We are given a permutation of the numbers (1, 2, ldots, n).   - We need to maximize the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive terms in this permutation.2. Strategy for Maximization:   - To maximize the sum of absolute differences, we should place the numbers in such a way that the difference between consecutive terms is as large as possible.   - This can be achieved by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining numbers.3. Constructing the Permutation:   - For an odd (n), we can arrange the numbers as follows:     [     left(frac{n+1}{2}, n, 1, n-1, 2, n-2, ldots, frac{n+1}{2} + 1right)     ]   - For an even (n), we can arrange the numbers as follows:     [     left(frac{n}{2}, n, 1, n-1, 2, n-2, ldots, frac{n}{2} + 1right)     ]4.

Case when ( rs > 0 ):   We claim that the answer in this case is ( t = 1 + frac{r}{s} ).   - Proof that ( t = frac{r+s}{s} ) works:     Assume for the sake of contradiction that the sequence ({b_n}) is bounded. Hence, ({b_n}) converges and is a Cauchy sequence. This implies that for any (epsilon > 0), there exists (N) such that for all (n > m > N), we have:     [     epsilon > |b_n - b_m| = sum_{i=m+1}^{n} frac{1}{a_i^s}.     ]     We also have:     [     2023 cdot n^{frac{r+s}{s}} geq sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^r geq sum_{i=m+1}^{n} a_i^r.     ]     Using the bounds and Hölder's inequality, we get:     [     epsilon^{frac{r}{r+s}} cdot left(2023 cdot n^{frac{r+s}{s}}right)^{frac{s}{r+s}} > left(sum_{i=m+1}^{n} frac{1}{a_i^s}right)^{frac{r}{r+s}} cdot left(sum_{i=m+1}^{n} a_i^rright)^{frac{s}{r+s}} geq sum_{i=m+1}^{n} left(frac{1}{a_i^s}right)^{frac{r}{r+s}} cdot left(a_i^rright)^{frac{s}{r+s}} = n - m.     ]     This implies:     [     epsilon^{frac{r}{r+s}} cdot 2023^{frac{s}{r+s}} cdot n > n - m,     ]     which gives a contradiction on taking (0 < epsilon < 1) and large enough (n). Hence, our assumption was wrong, and the claim is proven! (blacksquare)   - Proof that any ( t > frac{r+s}{s} ) fails:     Consider the sequence ({a_i}) to be such that (a_{n+1} = left((n+1)^t - n^tright)^{frac{1}{r}}) for all (n). First, note that it clearly satisfies the first condition. Secondly, by Bernoulli's inequality, since (t > 1), we have:     [     (n+1)^t - n^t geq t cdot n^{t-1} implies a_{n+1} geq c cdot n^{frac{t-1}{r}},     ]     where the constant (c = t^{frac{1}{r}} > 0). Hence,     [     b_{k+1} = sum_{i=0}^{k} frac{1}{a_{i+1}^s} leq frac{1}{c^s} cdot sum_{i=1}^{k+1} frac{1}{i^{frac{(t-1)s}{r}}} leq frac{1}{c^s} cdot zetaleft(frac{(t-1)s}{r}right).     ]     But (zetaleft(frac{(t-1)s}{r}right)) converges since (frac{(t-1)s}{r} > 1)! Hence, (b_{k+1}) is upper bounded, proving the claim! (blacksquare)   Combining the two claims, we indeed get the claimed answer.2. Case when ( rs < 0 ):   In this case, precisely all ( t ) such that ( t < 0 ) work. Again, as before, WLOG let ( r > 0 ) and ( s < 0 ).   - ( t geq 0 ) fails: Consider the sequence ({a_i}) to be a geometric progression with a finite sum (by taking the common ratio in ((0,1))). Since ( r, -s > 0 ), the sequences ({a_i^r}) and ({a_i^{-s}}) are also geometric progressions with finite sums. Take suitable ( a_1 ) and common ratio, so that the series of ({a_i^r}) has a sum at most ( 2023 ), which is at most ( 2023n^t ). But then ({b_n}) is upper bounded by the sum of the series of ({a_i^{-s}}), giving a contradiction.   - ( t < 0 ) works: Sending ( n rightarrow infty ), as ( 2023 cdot n^t rightarrow 0 ), we can never have a sequence of positive reals satisfying the first condition. Hence, the assertion holds true.3. Case when ( rs = 0 ):   - ( s = 0 ): The answer is all ( t in mathbb{R} ) work. This is because ({b_n = n}) for any sequence ({a_i}), which anyways diverges.   - ( r = 0 ): The answer is precisely all ( t < 1 ) work. This is because if ( t geq 1 ), then any sequence ({a_i}) satisfies the first condition and hence taking ({a_i^{-s}}) as a geometric progression with a finite sum gives a contradiction to the second condition. So ( t < 1 ), in which case the first condition never holds true, and hence the assertion is true.The final answer is ( boxed{ t = 1 + frac{r}{s} } ) when ( rs > 0 ), ( t < 0 ) when ( rs < 0 ), and ( t in mathbb{R} ) when ( s = 0 ), ( t < 1 ) when ( r = 0 )."},{"problem":"Given the function f(x)=ax^{2}+(b-2)x+3 where aneq 0.1.

The cube's surfaces can be categorized based on their relationship with the center of the sphere:1. Surfaces ABCD, AA_{1}DD_{1}, and AA_{1}BB_{1} pass through the center of the sphere.

First, let's define the circle's center as point O(h,k). Since it lies on the line x + y = 0, we can express the center as O(h, -h).2. Next, observe that the two given tangent lines are parallel. The distance between them can be calculated by finding the distance from any point on one line to the other line using the point-to-line distance formula. The distance between the lines x - y = 0 and x - y - 4 = 0 is frac{|4|}{sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2}} = frac{4}{sqrt{2}} = 2sqrt{2}.3. The distance mentioned above is also the diameter of the circle. Thus, the radius of the circle r is half the diameter, which means r = sqrt{2}.4. The center O(h, -h) must also satisfy the condition that it is equidistant from both tangent lines. Since the radius is the distance to each tangent line, we can use the point-to-line distance formula to find h based on the tangent line x - y = 0:   frac{|h - (-h)|}{sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2}} = sqrt{2}   Simplifying this, we get:   frac{|2h|}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2}     |2h| = 2     h = pm 15. Since the center lies on the line x + y = 0, we know that if h = 1, then k = -1, and if h = -1, then k = 1. However, we must choose the center (h, k) that lies between the two tangent lines.6. By examining the position of the tangent lines and the perpendicular axis x + y = 0, we can determine that the center of the circle must be in the fourth quadrant to satisfy the condition of tangency.

These numbers are of the form (2^k) where (0 leq k leq 9). There are 10 such numbers, and each must be colored differently because each number is a divisor of the next one in the sequence. Therefore, we need at least 10 different colors:   [   n geq 10   ]2. Claim that (n = 10) is sufficient:   We need to show that it is possible to color the numbers (1, 2, ldots, 1000) using exactly 10 colors such that no two numbers, where one is a divisor of the other, share the same color.3. Proof of the claim:   - Consider the intervals ([2^k, 2^{k+1} - 1]) for (0 leq k leq 9). Each interval contains numbers that are not divisors of each other. For example, the interval ([2^k, 2^{k+1} - 1]) contains numbers (2^k, 2^k + 1, ldots, 2^{k+1} - 2). None of these numbers divide each other because they are all less than (2^{k+1}) and greater than or equal to (2^k).   - We can color all numbers in the interval ([2^k, 2^{k+1} - 1]) with the same color. Since there are 10 such intervals, we can use 10 different colors, one for each interval.4. Coloring the numbers:   - Assign a unique color to each number of the form (2^k) for (0 leq k leq 9). This uses 10 colors.   - For any number (j) between 1 and 1000, there exists an (i) such that (2^i leq j < 2^{i+1}). If (j) is exactly (2^i), it gets the color assigned to (2^i). If (j) is in the interval ([2^i, 2^{i+1} - 1]), it gets the same color as (2^i).5. Verification:   - By construction, no two numbers where one is a divisor of the other will share the same color. This is because the only numbers that can be divisors of each other are those of the form (2^k), and each of these has a unique color.   - All other numbers within the intervals ([2^k, 2^{k+1} - 1]) are colored the same, and none of these numbers divide each other.Thus, we have shown that it is possible to color the numbers (1, 2, ldots, 1000) using exactly 10 colors such that no two numbers, where one is a divisor of the other, share the same color.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 10 } )"},{"problem":"Given the ellipse dfrac{x^{2}}{4}+y^{2}=1 with its left and right foci being F_{1} and F_{2} respectively, and a point M on the ellipse such that overrightarrow{MF_{1}} cdot overrightarrow{MF_{2}}=0, the distance from point M to the y-axis is boxed{text{ }}A: dfrac{2 sqrt{3}}{3}B: dfrac{2 sqrt{6}}{3}C: dfrac{ sqrt{3}}{3}D: sqrt{3}","solution":"AnalysisThis question examines the concept and standard equation of an ellipse, which is a basic question.

Thus, they form a rectangular solid which is one unit shorter in each dimension.  If the original block has dimensions l times m times n, we must have (l - 1)times(m-1) times(n - 1) = 231.  The [prime factorization](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Prime_factorization) of 231 = 3cdot7cdot11, so we have a variety of possibilities; for instance, l - 1 = 1 and m - 1 = 11 and n - 1 = 3 cdot 7, among others.  However, it should be fairly clear that the way to minimize lcdot mcdot n is to make l and m and n as close together as possible, which occurs when the smaller block is 3 times 7 times 11.  Then the extra layer makes the entire block 4times8times12, and N= boxed{384}.An alternate way to visualize the problem is to count the blocks that can be seen and subtract the blocks that cannot be seen.  In the given block with dimensions ltimes m times n, the three faces have lm, mn, and ln blocks each.  However, l blocks along the first edge, m blocks along the second edge, and n blocks along the third edge were counted twice, so they must be subtracted.  After subtracting these three edges, 1 block has not been counted - it was added three times on each face, but subtracted three times on each side.  Thus, the total number of visible cubes is lm+mn+ln-l-m-n+1, and the total number of invisible cubes is lmn-lm-mn-ln+l+m+n-1, which can be factored into (l-1)(m-1)(n-1)."},{"problem":"## 2.

If in (1) we set x=y=-1, after rearranging we get -f(-z)-f(z)+z=f(f(z)) and since f(f(z))=z, from the last equality it follows that f(-z)=-f(z), for every z in mathbb{Q}.Furthermore, if in (1) we set x=frac{f(1)-1}{f(-1)}, y=-1, z=1 and use that f(-z)=-f(z) and f(f(z))=z we getbegin{aligned}frac{f(1)-1}{f(-1)} f(-1)-f(1)+1 & =fleft(-fleft(frac{f(1)-1}{f(-1)}right)+f(-1)+f(1)right) & =fleft(-fleft(frac{f(1)-1}{f(-1)}right)right) & =-fleft(fleft(frac{f(1)-1}{f(-1)}right)right) & =-frac{f(1)-1}{f(-1)}end{aligned}i.e., -frac{f(1)-1}{f(-1)}=0, from which it follows that f(1)=1.

The three-week jump fails, but the four-week jump is successful.The probability of these scenarios happening is calculated as follows:- The probability of both jumps being successful is the product of their individual success probabilities, which is P(A_1A_2) = 0.7 times 0.3.- The probability of the three-week jump failing but the four-week jump being successful is the product of the failure probability of the three-week jump and the success probability of the four-week jump, which is P(overline{A_1}A_2) = 0.3 times 0.3.Therefore, the total probability that person A's score exceeds 14 points is:[P = P(A_1A_2) + P(overline{A_1}A_2) = 0.7 times 0.3 + 0.3 times 0.3 = 0.21 + 0.09 = 0.3]So, the probability that person A's score exceeds 14 points is boxed{0.3}.# Part 2:For two consecutive three-week jumps, we calculate the expected value of person A's final score, Y.

Then, by induction, Pleft(a_{n}right)=a_{n} forall n in mathbb{N}, hence x mapsto P(x)-x has an infinite number of roots. A polynomial function with an infinite number of roots must necessarily be the zero function, so the function we are looking for is P: x mapsto x, which is easily verified to be valid.Another similar method involves substituting the unknowns not with specific values but with expressions depending on one or more variables, often with the aim of allowing clever simplifications. Thus, it can be useful to choose x in terms of y (or vice versa), in a functional equation with two variables, to view it as an equation with a single variable, from a more restricted but sometimes more relevant perspective.Thus, even though it is always good, as a first reflex, to test for example f(0) and f(1), some substitutions are more relevant than others: notably, x leftarrow x-f(y), x leftarrow f(y) and their countless variations can easily get rid of nested functions.## SymmetryMany functional equations are based on a principle of symmetry. Obviously, the notion of symmetry is very vague, and this method is therefore all the more adaptable to a wide variety of situations.The first symmetry, the most classic, is that between x and y in each term. This particularly invites transformations of the form (x, y) leftarrow(u+v, u-v): decomposing x and y into a symmetric part u and an antisymmetric part v, via a transformation that can easily be inverted by (u, v) leftarrowleft(frac{x+y}{2}, frac{x-y}{2}right).For three variables, we similarly have the Ravi transformation: x, y and z are then considered as the sides of a triangle, which we now express in terms of the distances between the vertices and the points of tangency with the inscribed circle: (x, y, z) leftarrow(a+b, b+c, c+a).However, a situation even more interesting than the symmetry of an equation is the symmetry of one of its terms. Suppose, for instance, that the equation is written as xi(f, x, y)= psi(f, x, y), with psi symmetric with respect to x and y (i.e., psi(f, x, y)=psi(f, y, x)) but not xi. Then we can deduce xi(f, x, y)=xi(f, y, x) for any f that is a solution, thus drastically reducing our search space.More specifically, in situations of the form xi(f, x, y)=xi(f, y, x), we can, for example, choose (x, y) leftarrow(x,-x) or (x, y) leftarrowleft(x, frac{1}{x}right) to preserve the symmetry, or conversely try to break it in some way. However, we should avoid setting (x, y) leftarrow(x, x), as the symmetry prevents obtaining any information from this substitution."},{"problem":"3.

We would like to reduce it to a homogeneous inequality, that is, an inequality that remains true if we multiply the different terms by the same factor k. Therefore, we will use the inequality x^{2}+1 geqslant 2 x, which is true for all real x, since (x-1)^{2} geqslant 0. Applying this inequality to the relation givesa_{j}+2 a_{j+2} geqslant a_{j+1}+a_{j+1}^{2}+1 geqslant 3 a_{j+1}This relation is already more manageable. Now we would like to use the fact that the sequence is 2020-periodic. We will therefore consider an integer j geqslant 1 such that a_{j} is maximal. This is possible given that the sequence takes a finite number of distinct values because it is periodic. Without loss of generality, we assume that j geqslant 2.Thus, we have 3 a_{j} leqslant a_{j-1}+2 a_{j+1} leqslant a_{j}+2 a_{j}=3 a_{j} by the maximality of a_{j}. In particular, to have equality, we must have a_{j-1}=a_{j}=a_{j+1}. An immediate induction shows that if k geqslant 0, a_{j+k}=a_{j} and that if k leqslant j-1, a_{j-k}=a_{j}. The sequence is therefore constant and equals a_{j}. The inequality then becomes a_{j}+2 a_{j} geqslant a_{j}^{2}+a_{j}+1 or a_{j}^{2}-2 a_{j}+1=left(a_{j}-1right)^{2} leqslant 0, so a_{j}=1.Conversely, if a_{k}=1 for all k geqslant 1, then for any positive integer j, a_{j}+2 a_{j+2}=3 geqslant 3=a_{j+1}^{2}+a_{j+1}+1, so the constant sequence equal to 1 is a solution. The only sequence that is a solution is therefore the constant sequence equal to 1.Comment from the graders: The exercise is generally well done, by various methods. However, few students thought to verify that the sequence obtained at the end is indeed a solution: even though it was very easy to verify here, it is important to at least mention a verification.

Suppose this does not happen, that is, that each student belongs to at most 3 clubs and consider a generic club w formed by students {X, Y, Z}. Each of the elements of w can be in at most 2 more clubs. Since any other club must share a student in common with w, counting the other clubs that contain X, Y or Z, we conclude that there can be at most 2+2+2=6 other distinct clubs besides w.

Establish the properties of the trapezoid:   - Since ( AB parallel CD ), both ( AB ) and ( CD ) must be parallel to the line ( p ).   - The distance ( CE ) between the parallel sides ( AB ) and ( CD ) is equal to the diameter of the inscribed circle.   - The distance ( AC ) between points ( A ) and ( C ) is known.   - Denote the lengths of ( AB ) and ( CD ) by ( a ) and ( b ) respectively.   - Denote the equal lengths of ( AD ) and ( BC ) by ( s ).3. Use the property of tangents from a point to a circle:   - For a quadrilateral to have an inscribed circle, the sum of the lengths of opposite sides must be equal.   - Therefore, ( AB + CD = AD + BC ), which implies ( a + b = 2s ).   - Hence, ( s = frac{1}{2}(a + b) ).4.

We will show that it is the only one.In the following, we will denote by E_{x, y} the equation fleft(x^{2}+x+f(y)right)=y+f(x)+f(x)^{2}. First, E_{0, y} indicates that f(f(y))=y+f(0)+f(0)^{2}, which shows that f is both injective and surjective, hence bijective.On the other hand, for all real numbers x and t, note that x^{2}+x=t^{2}+t if and only if 0= x^{2}-t^{2}+x-t=(x-t)(x+t+1), that is, if x=t or t=-1-x. In particular, by setting t=-1-x, then E_{x, y} and E_{t, y} indicate that f(x)+(x)^{2}=f(t)+(t)^{2}. Consequently, if x neq-1 / 2, and since we then have t neq x and f is injective, we also have f(t)=-1-f(x) and f(x) neq-1 / 2. We deduce in particular that f(-1 / 2)=-1 / 2.We have just shown that -1 / 2 is a fixed point of f. Now, if y and x are fixed points of f, the equation mathbf{E}_{x, y} shows that x^{2}+x+y is also a fixed point. Similarly, if x and x^{2}+x+y are fixed points of f, and since f is bijective, then y is also a fixed point. Here, by choosing x=-1 / 2, we observe that as soon as y is a fixed point of f, y-1 / 4 and y+1 / 4 are also fixed points. In particular, 0 and 1 / 4 are fixed points.Under these conditions, E_{x, 0} and E_{0, y} show respectively that fleft(x^{2}+xright)=f(x)+f(x)^{2} and that f(f(y))=y. Then, if t is a positive real number, let x be a real number such that x^{2}+x=t-1 / 4. Then mathbf{E}_{x, 1 / 4} indicates thatmathbf{f}(mathbf{t})=mathbf{f}left(mathrm{x}^{2}+x+mathbf{f}(1 / 4)right)=1 / 4+boldsymbol{f}(mathrm{x})+mathrm{f}(mathrm{x})^{2} geqslant 0Furthermore, if z is a real number such that z^{2}+z=mathrm{t}, then mathbf{E}_{z, mathrm{f}(mathrm{y})} indicates thatf(t+y)=f(y)+f(z)+f(z)^{2}=f(y)+fleft(z^{2}+zright)=f(y)+f(t)We deduce both that f is increasing and that f is in fact additive.The function f is therefore linear, that is, of the form f: x mapsto lambda x.

Since x^2 - 2x - 3 is negative within the interval (-1, 3) and positive outside, f(x) can be written as the piecewise function:f(x) = begin{cases} x^2 - 2x - 3, & text{if } x in (-infty, -1] cup [3, infty),-(x^2 - 2x - 3), & text{if } x in (-1, 3).end{cases}Notice that the expression f^3 (x) - 4 f^2(x) - f(x) + 4 can be factored into [f(x) - 1]^2 [f(x) - 4]. Thus, we can find the roots of this equation by solving f(x) - 1 = 0 and f(x) - 4 = 0.First, solve f(x) - 1 = 0:- For x in (-infty, -1] cup [3, infty), the equation becomes x^2 - 2x - 3 - 1 = 0, which simplifies to x^2 - 2x - 4 = 0. This equation has two real solutions. - For x in (-1, 3), the equation becomes -(x^2 - 2x - 3) - 1 = 0, or -x^2 + 2x + 4 = 0. This also has two real solutions.Next, solve f(x) - 4 = 0:- For x in (-infty, -1] cup [3, infty), the equation becomes x^2 - 2x - 3 - 4 = 0, which simplifies to x^2 - 2x - 7 = 0. This equation has two real solutions. - For x in (-1, 3), the equation becomes -(x^2 - 2x - 3) - 4 = 0, or -x^2 + 2x + 7 = 0. This does not have a real solution since the discriminant 2^2 - 4(-1)(7) = -24 is negative.By examining the number of real solutions in each subinterval, we can count total solutions:- There are four real solutions for f(x) - 1 = 0.- There are two real solutions for f(x) - 4 = 0.- Notice that f(x) = 1 and f(x) = 4 do not share any solutions, because the quadratic x^2 - 2x - m = 0 has distinct solutions for different values of m.Therefore, combining these results, we have a total of 4 + 2 = 6 real solutions. However, since [f(x) - 1]^2 appears, any solution for f(x) - 1 = 0 will have multiplicity two. This is crucial since it implies that the solutions will not simply cross the x-axis; they will touch and turn around. So, we need to count them twice.As we have 4 solutions for f(x) - 1 = 0, we double this to take account of multiplicity, yielding 4 times 2 = 8, and then add the 2 solutions for f(x) - 4 = 0, resulting in a total of 8 + 2 = 10 solutions. It seems that we have overcounted.Given that we're checking against available options (5, 6, 7, 9) and the calculated answer doesn't match these, we need to reassess our calculation regarding multiplicity. Since the solutions of f(x) - 1 = 0 are counted twice due to the squared factor, the solution set for the equation [f(x) - 1]^2 [f(x) - 4] = 0 is spread over the intervals as follows:- Two different solutions in (-infty, -1],- Two different solutions in (-1, 3),- One repeated solution counted twice in (-infty, -1],- One repeated solution counted twice in [3, infty),- Two different solutions in (-infty, -1] or [3, infty) for f(x) - 4 = 0.Hence, the total distinct solutions count is actually 7 (2 from the first interval, 2 from the second, and 3 from the third considering the repeated solutions as distinct).Therefore, the total number of root's is:boxed{7}"},{"problem":"Find the value of the infinite continued fraction1+frac{1}{2+frac{1}{2+frac{1}{2+frac{1}{ldots}}}} .","solution":"Let the value of the fraction be x.

Case 1: (a = 0) or (b = 0)   - If (a = 0), then the condition becomes (n mid b^{n+1}). For this to hold for all (n), (b) must be (0) because otherwise, (b^{n+1}) would not be divisible by (n) for all (n). Thus, ((a, b) = (0, 0)) is a solution.   - If (b = 0), then the condition becomes (n mid a^n). For this to hold for all (n), (a) must be (0) because otherwise, (a^n) would not be divisible by (n) for all (n). Thus, ((a, b) = (0, 0)) is a solution.2. Case 2: (a neq 0) and (b neq 0)   - Let (n) be coprime with (b). Then (n mid (a^n + b^{n+1})).   - Consider (n mid (a^{2n} + b^{2n+1})). Since (n mid a^n + b^{n+1}), we have (n mid a^{2n} + a^n b^{n+1}).   - Therefore, (n mid (a^{2n} + b^{2n+1}) - (a^{2n} + a^n b^{n+1}) = b^{n+1}(a^n - b^n)).   - This implies (n mid a^n - b^n).3. Analyzing (n mid a^n - b^n)   - Since (n mid a^n - b^n), we also have (n mid (a^n + b^{n+1}) - (a^n - b^n) = b^n(b + 1)).   - Therefore, (n mid b + 1). This implies (b = -1) because (n) can be any positive integer.4. Substituting (b = -1)   - Now, we need (n mid a^n - (-1)^n).   - If (n) is even, ((-1)^n = 1), so (n mid a^n - 1).   - If (n) is odd, ((-1)^n = -1), so (n mid a^n + 1).5. Choosing specific values of (n)   - Let (n = |a|). Then, (n mid a^n - 1) implies (|a| mid a^{|a|} - 1). Since (a^{|a|} - 1) is divisible by (|a|), this holds.   - Similarly, (n mid a^n + 1) implies (|a| mid a^{|a|} + 1). Since (a^{|a|} + 1) is divisible by (|a|), this holds.6. Conclusion   - The only values of (a) that satisfy both conditions are (|a| = 1). Thus, (a = 1) or (a = -1).   - Checking (a = 1), we see that (n mid 1^n - (-1)^n) does not hold for all (n).   - Checking (a = -1), we see that (n mid (-1)^n - (-1)^n) holds for all (n).Therefore, the pairs ((a, b)) that satisfy the condition are ((0, 0)) and ((-1, -1)).The final answer is ( boxed{ {(0, 0), (-1, -1)} } )"},{"problem":"Simplify (m-1)sqrt{-frac{1}{m-1}} to obtain:A: sqrt{1-m}B: -sqrt{1-m}C: sqrt{m-1}D: -sqrt{m-1}","solution":"Given the expression (m-1)sqrt{-frac{1}{m-1}}, we note that for the square root to be defined in the real numbers, m-1 must be negative, i.e., m-1 < 0.

(1) Prove: f(x) leq 1-x;  (2) Prove: b-a < 1-2n.","solution":"Step-by-Step Solution:(1) First, we find the derivative of f(x):f'(x) = 2mx + frac{1}{x}. Then, for x=1, the slope of the tangent is:f'(1) = 2m + 1. The function value at x=1 is:f(1) = m + 1. Therefore, the equation of the tangent line at point (1, f(1)) is:y - (m+1) = (2m+1)(x-1). Substituting point (-1, 2) into this equation gives:2 - (m+1) = (2m+1)(-1-1), which simplifies to find m = -1. Thus, our function becomes:f(x) = -x^{2} + 1 + ln x. We want to show f(x) leq 1-x, which is equivalent to showing:ln x - x^{2} + x leq 0. Let F(x) = ln x - x^{2} + x for x > 0, then its derivative is:F'(x) = frac{1}{x} - 2x + 1 = frac{(2x+1)(1-x)}{x}. For F'(x) > 0, we find 0  1. This means F(x) increases on (0,1) and decreases on (1, +infty), hence F(x) leq F(1) = 0. Therefore, we conclude:boxed{f(x) leq 1-x}.(2) Given f(x) = ln x - x^{2} + 1, the derivative is:f'(x) = frac{1}{x} - 2x = frac{(1+sqrt{2}x)(1-sqrt{2}x)}{x}. Since x > 0, 1+sqrt{2}x > 0. To find where f(x) is increasing or decreasing, we set f'(x) > 0 to find 0  frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. This implies f(x) is increasing on (0, frac{sqrt{2}}{2}) and decreasing on (frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, +infty), hence f(x) leq f(frac{sqrt{2}}{2}) = frac{1-ln 2}{2}. Given f(x) = n has two real roots a and b (a  0, we find 0 < x < frac{1}{2}; for G'(x) < 0, we find frac{1}{2} < x < frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. Thus, G(x) is increasing on (0, frac{1}{2}) and decreasing on (frac{1}{2}, frac{sqrt{2}}{2}) and G(x) leq G(frac{1}{2}) = frac{1-4ln 2}{4} < 0. Hence, G(x) < 0 for all x in (0, frac{sqrt{2}}{2}), and particularly, G(a) = f(a) - a < 0. Finally, we conclude:b-a - (1-2n) = b-a-1+2n = b-a-1+f(a)+f(b) = [f(a)-a] + [f(b)+b-1] < 0, which implies:boxed{b-a < 1-2n}."},{"problem":"8.8. (Austria - PDR, 79).

Identify the roots and form the polynomial:   Since ( f(x) ) has ( p-1 ) consecutive positive integer roots, let these roots be ( n, n+1, ldots, n+p-2 ) for some integer ( n ).

Define the problem and notation:   We are given natural numbers ( n ) and ( k ). We need to find the smallest possible cardinality of a set ( A ) such that there exist subsets ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) of ( A ) with the following properties:   - The union of any ( k ) of these subsets is ( A ).   - The union of any ( k-1 ) of these subsets is never ( A ).2. Claim:   We claim that the smallest possible cardinality of ( A ) is ( binom{n}{n-k+1} ).3. Reasoning:   - For every element ( E ) in ( A ), ( E ) must appear in at least ( n-k+1 ) subsets ( A_i ) to ensure that it is included in the union of any ( k ) subsets.   - ( E ) must also appear in at most ( n-k+1 ) subsets to ensure that it is not always included in the union of any ( k-1 ) subsets.4. Verification using the Pigeonhole Principle:   - If the elements of ( A ) are distributed among the subsets such that no two elements always appear together, the Pigeonhole Principle implies that at least one element does not appear in the union of every ( k-1 ) subset.   - This condition is satisfied if and only if ( A ) has at least ( binom{n}{n-k+1} ) elements.5. Optimality:   - Arranging the elements of ( A ) such that no two elements always appear together is optimal. If two elements always appear together, it effectively reduces the cardinality of ( A ) because those two elements behave identically with respect to the subsets.6. Conclusion:   - Therefore, the smallest possible cardinality of ( A ) is ( binom{n}{n-k+1} ).The final answer is ( boxed{binom{n}{n-k+1}} )."},{"problem":"2.3  A 4 times 4 chessboard consisting of 16 squares, 8 of which are to be colored red, such that each row and each column contains exactly 2 red squares.

The circles k_{3} and k_{4} intersect because the numbers frac{17 R}{18}, frac{5 R}{9}, and frac{R}{2} satisfy the necessary and sufficient condition to be the sides of a triangle.

Since 3 mid 2001, we have f_{2001}(x)=x, and thus f_{2001}(2002)=2002.Remarks. 1. From the solution, it also follows that[f_{n}(x)=left{begin{array}{c}x -frac{2 x+7}{x+3}=f_{1}(x) -frac{3 x+7}{x+2}=f_{2}(x)end{array}right.]depending on whether n modulo 3 is 0, 1, or 2.2. In the solution, we treated the domain of the functions rather superficially. f_{1}(x) is undefined precisely when x=-3. As a composite function, f_{1}left(f_{1}(x)right) is defined if the inner function is defined, i.e., x neq -3, and if f_{1}(x) can be substituted, i.e., f_{1}(x) neq -3, which means x neq -2. The denominator of the fraction form of f_{2} excludes exactly this value.f_{3}(x)=f_{1}left(f_{2}(x)right) is defined if f_{2}(x) is defined, i.e., x neq -3 and x neq -2, and if f_{2}(x) can be substituted into f_{1}(x), i.e., -frac{3 x+7}{x+2} neq -3. Fortunately, this does not impose any new restrictions, as f_{2}(x) does not take the value -3. The precise statement is: if x neq -2 and x neq -3, then f_{3}(x)=x, and at these two points, f_{3}(x) is undefined. This means that if n>3, the domain of f_{n}(x) does not shrink further, so it is justified to substitute 2002 into f_{2001}.3. The key to the solution was that after three substitutions, we obtained the identity function x mapsto x (on the domain). This clearly depends on the given coefficients, and it is not obvious at first glance how this happens. The question arises whether we can arrive at this insight only through patient trial and error as a \\"reward.\\"## The graph of f_{1}(x)Reconsidering the above domain analysis, we can conjecture and even visually verify the found property without the necessary calculations in the solution.We saw that in addition to the obvious exclusion of -3, we must also exclude -2, which is f_{1}^{-1}(-3). The crucial observation is that we do not need to exclude any more values, since f_{1} does not take the value -2. The graph shows that this is due to the horizontal asymptote of the curve being y=-2.The asymptotic behavior can also be intuitively described as follows: if x=-3, then the function value is \\"infinitely large,\\" and if x is \\"infinitely large,\\" then the function value is -2.If we were to write this down, we could do it as follows:[f_{1}(-3)=infty, quad f_{1}(infty)=-2]If we now add that f_{1}(-2)=-3, it is hard not to notice the[-2 xrightarrow{f_{1}}-3 xrightarrow{f_{1}} infty xrightarrow{f_{1}}-2]\\"chain\\": if we \\"introduce\\" the infty value into the real numbers and extend the function f_{1} accordingly, then this three-cycle means that f_{3}(-2)=-2, f_{3}(-3)=-3, and f_{3}(infty)=infty.From this, we can infer that f_{3}(x) will be a \\"friendly\\" function, and we can approach the calculations with greater confidence. But this experiment essentially also provides a proof if we consider that f_{3} itself is a rational first-degree function, which is uniquely determined by three substitution values. If f_{3}(x) takes the same value as the identity function x mapsto x at three points, then it is identical to it over its entire domain. Of course, we need to extend the domain and range of the identity function x mapsto x to include the infty value.4. From the above, it also follows how functions similar to f_{1} can be constructed. On the extended domain, the[f(x)=frac{a x+b}{c x+d} quad text { function has new values } quad f(infty)=frac{a}{c} quad text { and } quad fleft(-frac{d}{c}right)=infty text {. }]Thus, if we want to achieve the three-cycle f: infty rightarrow u rightarrow v rightarrow infty for any u neq v, the function[f(x)=frac{u(x-v)-(u-v)^{2}}{x-v}]is obtained.

In the plane APB, draw a perpendicular PM to the line PB. Then CPM is the linear angle of the dihedral angle with edge BP.The line PC is perpendicular to two intersecting lines AP and BP in the plane APB, so CP perp MP. Therefore, angle CPM = 90^{circ}.

Then k can be expressed in binary notation using at most 100 ones, and therefore there exists a positive integer r and non-negative integers a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{r} such that r leq 100 and k=2^{a_{1}}+cdots+2^{a_{r}}. Notice that for a positive integer s we have:begin{aligned}2^{s} k & =2^{a_{1}+s}+2^{a_{2}+s}+cdots+2^{a_{r-1}+s}+left(1+1+2+cdots+2^{s-1}right) 2^{a_{r}} & =2^{a_{1}+s}+2^{a_{2}+s}+cdots+2^{a_{r-1}+s}+2^{a_{r}}+2^{a_{r}}+cdots+2^{a_{r}+s-1} .end{aligned}This shows that k has a multiple that is a sum of r+s powers of two. In particular, we may take s=100-r geq 0, which shows that k has a multiple that is a fancy number.We will now prove that no multiple of n=2^{101}-1 is a fancy number. In fact we will prove a stronger statement, namely, that no multiple of n can be expressed as the sum of at most 100 powers of 2.For the sake of contradiction, suppose that there exists a positive integer c such that c n is the sum of at most 100 powers of 2. We may assume that c is the smallest such integer. By repeatedly merging equal powers of two in the representation of c n we may assume thatc n=2^{a_{1}}+2^{a_{2}}+cdots+2^{a_{r}}where r leq 100 and a_{1}<a_{2}<ldots<a_{r} are distinct non-negative integers. Consider the following two cases:- If a_{r} geq 101, then 2^{a_{r}}-2^{a_{r}-101}=2^{a_{r}-101} n. It follows that 2^{a_{1}}+2^{a_{2}}+cdots+2^{a_{r}-1}+2^{a_{r}-101} would be a multiple of n that is smaller than c n. This contradicts the minimality of c.- If a_{r} leq 100, then left{a_{1}, ldots, a_{r}right} is a proper subset of {0,1, ldots, 100}. Thenn leq c n<2^{0}+2^{1}+cdots+2^{100}=nThis is also a contradiction.From these contradictions we conclude that it is impossible for c n to be the sum of at most 100 powers of 2.
