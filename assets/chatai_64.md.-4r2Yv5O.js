It hurt and the ER xray showed nothing broken and perhaps a bruise. I was in pain for about two weeks and kept ice on it for the immediate 24-48 hours. A bruise came through and the only pain I had was kneeling on it. After the first week I forgot about the injury and knelt down to pick something up and the pain was unbelievable along with a gush of warm liquid feeling. Since then I have a funny sensation as if I had a scar like after an operation. I feel no pain in the bone or joint during walking or jogging or exercising. However I do feel pain kneeling on it. It swells and if I bump my knee while doing anything I feel a sharp pain and tingling. I went to an ortho doctor and he stated I had nerve damage. I saw a doctor an had a full EMG done and it was reported normal and healthy. I had an MRI done and it states No occult fractures are seen within ght e osseous structurs of the right knee. No significant osseous contusion are visualized. The anterior andposterior cruciate ligaments are intact. No definitive tears are seen with in the medial or lateral menisci. There is a myxoid degeneration in the posterior horn of the medial meniscus. There is mild narrowing of the medial compartment. No abnormal signal is seen within the distal quadriceps or patellar tendons. Medial collateral ligman is intact. No abnormal signal is seen in the iliotibibial band fibulocollateral ligament or biceps femoris tendon. The medial and lateral retinacula are intact. There is minimal edema seen anterior to the patella. No abnormal signal is seen in the posterior patellar cartilage. So what does this mean? Will I need to surgery?","Doctor":"Hi there. Thanks for your question at HCM. Meniscus is a disc like shock absorbing structure which is present between the two bones of your knee joint. It helps in smooth transition of movements from flexion to extension , as in kneeling down. When we kneel down the posterior most or the back end of the meniscus absorbs the maximum pressure of movement. Hence damage to this part can manifest as pain on kneeling(as in your case). Myxoid degeneration is a type of degeneration usually seen in peripheral tears pf the meniscus. It requires observation only. Fortunately for you, you should be fine if you avoid kneeling down. Its a wait and see kind of situation , surgery will be the last resort. Hope this helps. All the best. Regards.

I m 38 years old and in good shape with no other health conditions, other than sinus bradycardia. Lately the pain has increased and I have felt numbness in my small toes of my right foot and all my toes in my left except my big toe. Also I have had increased urination worse in early morning going some cases 4 times in an hour. The MRI results are as follows: Dessication of D3-4, D4-5,D5-6,D6-7,and D9-10. Some minimal posterior projection of discovertebral material at D3-4,D4-5. Also early osteophyte formation. At the D7-8 level on the right there is minimal undulation of the posterior margin of the discovertebral complex with equivocal findings of small protrusions. At te D8-9 level there is undulation of the posterior aspect of the discovertebral complex at the foraminal entrance with projections of the spinal canal possible neural encroachment. At the D9-10 level, there is asymmetry of the disc with posterior projections of discovertebral material extending from right paracentral region to the foraminal exit which is suspicious for an area of soft disc protrusion. This is about 1.3 cm in transverse dimension and about 5 mm in AP dimension. There is compression of exiting D9 nerve root on the right. Are the new symptoms likely related to the disc degeneration or neural or nerve root impingement? What should I do?","Doctor":"Hi there. Thanks for your question at HCM. Compression in thoracic spine can be associated with numbness of legs/ foot with bowel or bladder disturbances(as in your case). But the findings in your 8 year old MRI do not seem significant enough to attribute your current symptoms to such compression( the dimensions mentioned in the MRI needs to be correlated with your background and dimensions of surrounding structures. Since the MRI is 8 year old, I would suggest you to get a new MRI after meeting your physician. We also need to rule out other conditions which can lead to your current symptomatology ( neuropoathies as in Diabetes Mellitus). Any new symptom in the background of such an MRI needs further evaluation for sure.Hope this helps. All the best. Regards.

Yes it is possible to hurt in front after falling on your back(more so in the chest area). The ribs are log structures extending form the back at the area of your spine to the front till the area of your sternum. Since it is a continuous structure it is possible that force transmission can happen along the bone during a fall and it can break either at point of contact or further upfront. I would suggest you to meet your physician for an x ray to confirm the same. At the least based on your x ray you will require a rib belt and analgesics. Hope this helps. All the best. Regards.

Ice pack application and gel application( analgesic gels) with rest can help relieve the spasm over initial 24 to 48 hours. If your neck hurts when you bend forwards, you should not use a pillow while sleeping. However you should consider and get evaluated for a pinched nerve if: 1.You have numbness of tingling sensation in your arms or fingers. 3. Any pain which is radiating along your arm downwards.( like sciatica pain in the legs) 3. Any muscle in your limb feels weak. 4.

I went to work and can type and lift objects with no issue. There s also some small swelling in a small area directly around the spot, but not any further up or down my arm.

If you are abke to do full range of movements your wrist it is very unlikely tonhave a fracture.  I think you need jot go for an Xray at present.  Only very rare cases of un displaced hairline fractures all movements are possile without pain. (Even in this  instance direct pressure over the bone would cause pain).

This occurred after I got injured in basketball a few weeks ago. I have not done any form of physical exercise after my injury, besides daily stretching. I was wondering if these are symptoms of having a torn meniscus. In addition, whenever i bend the knee i feel something moving inside. Thanks","Doctor":"Hi there . Thanks for yourbquewtioj at HCM.It is possible that your symptoms are caused by a mild meniscal tear. Meniscus is a disc like cushion between the two articulating surfaces of your knee joint. Two menisci in each knee work as shock absorbers during bending and twisting movements of your knee. When it is injured this shock absorbing function is lost and it can get caught or squeezed between the articulating surfaces. This can cause pain on movements like bending, squating, geting up from a chair, twisting movements associated with going up and down stairs.In more  severe  forms it can be associated wity stiffness of knee wity inability to bend fully, giving way or popping sensation and  more severe pain.If you cannot managee your dailyb routine without pain, it will be prudent to meet a sport physicain and let her/him evaluate your knee. The pain while going up and down the stairs cann suggest some injury to associated ligaments of the knee. Hope this helps. All the best.

The best thing you can do is when you wake up in the morning, before getting out of bed and taking a step, give yourself a little foot rub.There are many things you can try to help your foot get better:Give your feet a rest. Cut back on activities that make your feet hurt. Try not to walk or run on hard surfaces.Use shoes with good arch support and a cushioned sole.Do toe stretches, calf stretches and towel stretches several times a day, especially when you first get up in the morning.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"i have had pins and needles in my right hand , also i get very hot sometimes and also i have had some pains in my chest , which was really bad pain , it lasted for about 5 mins with the pain , the pain went away but even now as i type i have the pins and needles in my right hand , i dont use computers a lot . what should i do ?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks  for  your query.The abnormal sensations that you have such as burning, pins and needles are termed peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral Neuropathy is a condition caused by damage to the peripheral nervous system [most commonly seen in diabetic patients]. Another possibility could be nerve compression in spine due to disc bulge.Change your diet and remove inflammatory foods such as citrus fruits, dairy products and wheat that may aggravate the condition. Simultaneously increase your intake of potassium and calcium-rich foods such as bananas and avocados and green leafy vegetablesVitamin B12 is important in the maintenance of health and normal functioning of the nerve tissue and deficiency of it can lead to numbness. You can increase B12 level by taking meat and fish, or you can take tab methylcobalamine .I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"I was hit by a line drive softball to the side of my shin.

Her pain is awful can anything else be done. Thank you, Jerry","Doctor":"Hi there, thanks for your question at HCM.Pain in the groin due to hip often radiates to the knee, as the nerves supplying both are same.With th past history of injury , we can expect some kind of arthritis. Cartilage is a structure which covers the articulating bone ends( similar to the clothes we wear).Cartilage allows smoooth transmission of forces like weight bearing forces across the joint. When cartilage is destroyed, as in the case with your mother, the naked bone surfaces rub against each other with direct contact . This can be excruciatingly painful due to the exposed nerve endings. Total hip replacement is aboon in such cases , as the rubbing painfull surfaces are replacebey by artificial structures which do not feel pain. If the physician and anaesthetist feels your mother is fit to undergo the surgical procedure I feel a total hip has the potential of making tge remainder of her life pain free.

Meniscus is a disc like structure present between the knee joint responsible for soft gliding during movements. It is responsible for full range of gliding movements atvthe knee joint. Inability to straighten suggess that part of this meniscus is toen and his feet bcaught between the gliding bone surfaces.  The color changes in the bruise is natural healing process of a bruise. Also pain on walking can mean injury to other structures or a bruise on the bone also.The stiffness. can also be due to blood collection in the joint.

A gastroscopy will help in the diagnosis.Secondly it may be due to pancreatitis(Inflammation of pancreas). Stop smoking and alcohol if any. Blood tests like serum amylase and lipase will help in the diagnosis.Thirdly kidney stones. X ray of the KUB will help in the diagnosis. Antispasmodic for pain. Increased intake of water is advised.

I drink lots of water and green tea, both decaffeinated and regular. I also have (sometimes) two or three cups of coffee a day. The reason I have this question is because I love coffee (prefer it black). I don t drink it with sugar because I don t care for sugar in my coffee or in anything else. However, I sometimes drink a cup of black coffee or put a non-diary creamer (thinking that s better than black) in it. I have had three intestinal surgeries in the past (the last one being two years ago) and my wellness doctor states that caffeine can cause leaky intestines. Is there anyway at all I can continue having coffee without intestinal concerns? So far I ve not had any problems. I had heard that there is an excellent coffee (very expensive) that can be agreeable to a situation such as mine. My surgeries began from a car accident in 1988 (ruptured diaphragm). Then years later this caused scar tissue to build-up which then created blockages in the intestines. Therefore, a second surgery was required to open up the intestines and unblock the problem. I was told not to eat grains, seeds, popcorn, berries of any kind, nuts, etc. and to always chew my food well. I followed doctor s orders, however, over time another blockage developed in addition to creating two hernias. Apparently, I caused the hernias from lifting and carrying too many books while I was attending college classes. Thereby, another surgery was required. Since then I developed one more blockage from eating a piece of meat I didn t chew well. The doctor wanted to operate a fourth time and I said absolutely not! I said I would change my eating habits on my own and I have successfully done so. I no longer consume meat, only fish. I eat some dairy products in small amounts. I eat eggs, well cooked vegetables, and very soft fruits (no skin). I don t drink sodas (never did), no alcohol (over 24 years), or juices. I only drink water, green tea, skimmed milk, and coffee (1-3 a day). Any suggestions? Is there a special coffee that is okay to drink? Or should I absolutely stop all coffee (regular/decaffeinated)? By the way, I don t smoke nor take any drugs (prescription or otherwise). I take supplements (Standard Process) only and Fish Oil. I am now 65 years of age and overall my health is really good. I have had numerous hip replacements from being born with hip displacements and have congenital feet and hand deformities (many surgeries in the past to correct these conditions as well). I really do want an answer regarding my coffee intake. No matter what is recommended, I will follow what is suggested. Thank you, Respectfully, T.J. Currier (nickname for Trudi)","Doctor":"Hi Trudi. I feel your concern. You are really brave having had so many surgeries. And most importantly now your determination to follow whatever is instructed.That's a factor which has motivated me to express the management experience that I acquired through my own life been in the habit of consuming coffees n teas in excess. The difference between you and me is only that I could understand Ayurveda and medical aspects better having been trained in this field.Do not want to leave coffee or can leave ? Latter option is better. But you die for coffee ! Okay at 65 enjoy the rest of life with little easy procedures.Get Licorice powder ( Glycyrrhiza glabra) and Amalaki ( Indian gooseberry) - Phyllanthus emblica powder. Mix in equal quantities. Take half  to  one teaspoonful, lick by mixing in honey at least 8 hrly or 12 hrly. This will smear your inner lining of stomach and intestines against pungent foods and acid etc. It will heal Ulcers too. Do not take anything for 30 minutes or so. But that doesn't mean you start taking excess coffee.One more alternative is Avipattikar chooran - a classic herbal powder combo - commonly available in India. May get on net or we can also help if needed. Similar way it can be taken as explained above. If you do not like honey or is diabetic, these may be taken with water or milk too.Taste may not be palatable. But being natural its safe, effective but little slow unlike toxic drugs. So you will be at advantage with your determination.As for your scars and strictures in intestines, please get BAEL ( stone apple) pulp powder. Take 1 tsp twice or thrice in yogurt or with water regularly. If you mix it with Isabgul husk 1 tsp , it will be much better. Again commonly available in India.Now most important. Learn little Yoga simple exercises for stomach and intestines. Do for 20- 30 minutes a day. Do little deep breathing exercises. See difference in next one month.All above are totally harmless, scientific, natural and economic.Now be happy.

I started working out lately (resistance training) and sometimes I feel pain in my left shoulder and a bit of numbness down my arm (little and ring fingers mainly). What bothers my, maybe more than the pain, is the awkward look. What steps should I take to get rid of this problem? Thanks a lot.","Doctor":"Hi there, thanks for your question. Raised shoulder and collar bone in one side is uauualy due to abnormal alignment of your axial skeleton, whcih includes the spine and the chest cage or rib cage. If the cosmetic appearance is bothering you, I suggest you to get X rays of your chest and spine done, to ascertain the cause of the imbalance of shoulders. Once it's confirmed, depending on the severity and your willingness solution can easily be reached ( which might include surgery) .Also occasional numbness does not need evaluation. If starts increasing or persists we might have to look into it. Hope this helps. All the best. Regards. Dr.SBK"},{"Patient":"I recently (6 weeks ago) sustained a crushing injury to my knee.

Good morining.

The colour of the urine could be due to the friction of the calculi with the inner wall of the ureter giving rise to some amount of bleeding in the system.

Lasts for about 5 seconds. I take 2 to 3 deep breathes and it goes away. Had a doctor check my heart beat for any abnormality but none were found.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks  for  your query.* Left side chest pain is what we are always afraid of as heart issues can give such symptom.However if the pain has appeared suddenly with shortness of breath and someradiation to the arm, pneumothorax is possible. This condition can appear with no reason. Sometimes sudden cough or sudden lift of heavy object can cause it. It is more possible if you smoke or have chronic lungs disease like asthma or bronchitis.If nothing like that is present, strained muscle is the most probable reason. Strained muscle usually appears only when the chest is moving, and should be completely gone when lying down and not breathing.

This condition can appear with no reason. Sometimes sudden cough or sudden lift of heavy object can cause it. It is more possible if you smoke or have chronic lungs disease like asthma or bronchitis.If nothing like that is present, strained muscle is the most probable reason. Strained muscle usually appears only when the chest is moving, and should be completely gone when lying down and not breathing. If the pain is sharp and well localized, more intense when breathing, rib nerve issue is the most probable reason.In both cases, rest and anti-inflammatory medicines like Diclophenac should help.If the pneumothorax sounds possible, you should have chest x-ray done as soon as possibleI do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"I ve had a lot of problems with my foot.

Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If you had some food from outside, food poisoning might be a possiblility. However it should have been associated with loose motions and vomiting as well. Normal ultrasound excludes the possibility of a right sided ectopic as well. If I were your doctor, I would advise you for a urine routine, microscopic, and culture sensitivity test as sometimes a urine infection could also give rise to such symptoms associated possibly with fever.I would also clinically examine your abdomen to rule out the features of acute appendicitis, which is more of a clinical diagnosis than an ultrasound or other supportive investigations including a stool routine test for ova and cyst.In such a situation, I would advise you to wait and watch, and if the pain increases in intensity, to revisit your treating doctor for a review assessment of your abdomen.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in planning your treatment.

I have been playing badminton with intermittent breaks (1-2 year at a stretch) for about 17 years now. I have never played professionally but when I do play I play it regularly and I generally play for long hours. I have been noticing that I have tired legs for past 4 years. Initially I thought maybe it is because of my habit of sleeping late, sleeping for less than 6 hours on an average and my smoking habits. But then for past 2 years I have stopped smoking and have improved on my sleep patterns. But the problem of fatigued legs, especially my knees has been increasing. Though there is no swelling or any pain in any particular area, I do not feel the same energy in my knees like before. To sum it up, earlier I had a good jump and I used to jump and smash. But now I rarely jump. I don t plan and not jump but its just that I have involuntarily stopped jumping for hitting smashes because I don t feel comfortable with my knee. I get searing pain at certain angles. I cannot climb the stairs in a carefree manner for the fear of that searing pain at certain angles. At those angles when that pain comes, I have to balance myself using my other leg or else I feel like I could not take my body weight and will tumble. I can t remember of any specific injury or anything apart from one incident when I was trying to stamp my right foot in the ground really hard and then I felt a sharp pain in my knee. The pain was a so sharp that I got scared and stopped. But it wasn t like a continuous pain but I felt that something went wrong with my knee that day. I eventually stopped playing for about a year and then my knees felt better but then what started to happen was that my knees would feel tired about playing for about say an hour. Earlier I could easily manage it for 2-3 hours with breaks between matches and occasionally sit-outs between consecutive matches. Also now I don;t jump to smash and also I don t jump to reach to shuttles near the net from center of the court. It has affected my ability to cover court during the play.","Doctor":"Hello, I have studied your case.As per your age and history there is possibility of soft tissue injury in knee.Most commonly meniscus injury occurs may be associated collateral ligament injury.

Serum calcium levels.2. Serum Uric acid levels.3. RA factor4. ESR and CRP5. Serum Creatinine6.

A physical examination would indicate to a physician the likely site of the pain which could be further investigated with X-rays of your spine, hip and femur.The nature of your pain suggests to me that this is more likely a hip joint or thigh muscle problem. If the pain is coming from your hip joint the most common diagnosis at your age would be osteoarthritis of the hip joint. A strain of the quadriceps muscle can also cause such pain, which will likely improve over a period of 2-3 weeks.

Thank you","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks  for  your query.From your symptoms, it seems that you are suffering from plantar fasciitis. It happens due to inflammation of the plantar fascia.It hurts the most with the first few steps in the morning because the plantar fascia is tight and has not stretched out yet, and throughout the day it loosens up. The best thing you can do is when you wake up in the morning, before getting out of bed and taking a step, give yourself a little foot rub.There are many things you can try to help your foot get better:Give your feet a rest. Cut back on activities that make your feet hurt. Try not to walk or run on hard surfaces.Use shoes with good arch support and a cushioned sole.Do toe stretches, calf stretches and towel stretches several times a day, especially when you first get up in the morning.To help the pain, ice the area immediately after getting up in the morning. You can use either a store-bought cold pack or a frozen wet towel. Ice for 10 or 15 minutes. To reduce inflammation, take an aspirin or ibuprofen at mealtime.A 4-inch wide Crepe bandage wrapped around the region also helps reduce discomfort.Consider using soft silicone heel cushions for preventing any further damage to fasciaI do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"Having severe pain in right foot.

Should I see my doctor?","Doctor":"Hii there.A bruise usually goes through colour changes over time.It can change from red colour initially to yellowish brown by end of the week..But it is expected to decrease in size after the first two days.Its my opinion that since you are on blood thinners, an increase in size of bruise should be reviewed and seen by a doctor in perso, as blood thinners can cause accumulation of blood in the area of bruise.U might need blood tests to review your parameters.In the mean time application of pressure by a crepe bandage can help control the swelling.It is best if you can meet a physician and get the swelling and colour changes reviewed by her/him. All the best. Regards."},{"Patient":"I fell down the stairs last night, bruised my left upper shoulder and the top of my left foot is swollen and hurts a little. There is no black and blue anywhere and I started icing it and resting all day. I had a small bump on the back of my head that went away. I m going to a wedding this week and will resting and icing decrease the swelling? I don t have a headache or dizziness. I m a 66 healthy and active woman.","Doctor":"Hi there, thanks for the question. Rest, Ice application definitely help in reducing swelling during first few days after foot injruy. LImb elevation on two pillows also helps in reducing swelling. If u have to participate in a wedding it is advisable to apply a pressure crepe bandage or well fitting stockings to keep swelling under control. It is advisable not to walk excessively and avoid walking on in even surfaces during first 2 weeks after foot injury. If your pain and swelling still persists .and it hurts very time u step foot on the ground. It is best to meet an orthopedic surgeon personally and get an x Ray to rule out other injuries and sprains..all the best .regards.."},{"Patient":"My MRI says disc dissection and degeneration.

For about a week, I have been experiencing a sharp, kind of stabbing pain in my lower left abdomen (directly next to my hipbone) when I walk or do anything that involves moving my torso. I feel it when I extend my leg when taking a step and I end up walking differently to compensate for it. It becomes much more prominent immediately after I eat and if I don t eat for a few hours it s much less noticeable. The pain is very localized and in the exact same spot every time I feel it. I mentioned it to my dad when it started and I didn t talked about it to anyone again until today because I thought that it was going to go away. If anything, it feels worse now than before and I m scared to move or eat (I haven t stopped doing either); It s very uncomfortable and it feels very wrong. It sounds strange, but the best way for me to describe it is that it feels like one of my organs is out of place. I noticed a bit of swelling when I got home today, but there s none now and I don t know if it was real or if my nerves were getting to me (I did check a few times to confirm it, so it was probably legitimate). I only checked for it for the first time today, so I don t know if there has been any for in past week. I tried to ignore it, but I m scared now. I almost contacted my parents at work today so that I could ask them to take me to the hospital because I didn t know what to do. What do I do? What could it be?","Doctor":"Thank you for using HCM. It could be neurological or abdominal condition which needs clinical examination and if needed further tests like an ultrasound.

As I was going upstairs from the basement, I had a camera case on one shoulder and another case on the other shoulder, which contained all my supplies, such as makeup, hair dryer and other heavy items. As I reached the second step, I guess the heavy cases pulled me backwards and I fell. My son helped me up and asked if I could put weight on my leg and I could. I stayed the week, taking the girls to school each day and other places, I was very sore and going up and stairs was somewhat difficult and my top of leg at my hip turned every color, I did not go to the ERdown in Raleigh. I thought it was better until I rode home on Oct. 24th, but it started hurting after the ride home. I decided to go to the ER on Sat. Oct, 25th for x-rays as I was scared of a blood clot. I do have a Hematoma on my leg just below my knee. The ER Dr. At Northern Hospital in Mt. Airy, NC ordered x-Ray and and MRI. They do not have MRI service on Sat, so I think it was another test she ran as she put warm solution on my legs and looked for blood clots with an object she moved back and forth, starting at my crotch. I have continued walking everyday I can, and it has not bothered me, as a matter of fact it feels better after I walk. Yesterday, I walked on mt treadmill for 20-25 minutes.

I believe you have osteoporosis, a condition , where the bones get brittle with age and are more prone to fractures. I would suggest that you get a bone density test done and also blood screening for VIT D, calcium levels and Rheumatoid arthritis . If not found within their normal limits, one can take supplements for these , and I would also recommend you to start an exercise routine for the fitness of your spine, to help develop your core strength and thereby maintaining your posture and disc heights, by bringing it back to its position. Here are some specific exercises to relieve pain in your neck. 1. Self stretching for side neck muscles, by trying to touch the ear on the shoulder of the same side, 2. Do gentle neck movements in all directions. Go only as far as you can, do not push beyond from where the pain starts. The pain will slowly vanish away. Try to feel the quality of the movement as you practice this everyday. I would recommend that you do it in supine lying position .Thank you,and take care. Dr. Nidhi Sood. (PT)"},{"Patient":"Hi.

It feels like a blunt kind of pain, and at times I think it’s gas or a need to use the bathroom for number two, not to be gross. I struggle with constipation and it often resolves itself in the form of painful diarrhea. These past two months, I noticed that this pain came the same day I tried new foods that did not particularly sit well with me.

Continuous massage over a month or two and turmeric will show you what you expect. This oil will strengthen the muscles. It may be applied on joints too for strength. It will smoothen the knot.

I heard a loud pop and my ankle swelled almost immediately and was black and blue and swollen for a couple weeks. I iced it pretty religiously for a few days and did started stretching exercises as soon as I could. After a few weeks it still didn t feel right (I ve sprained both ankles several times before) so I went to see my doctor who took an x-ray to see if it was broken or if there was an avulsion. He didn t see anything and told me to stay off of it for 6 weeks. So I did. Since then I ve been back to playing soccer and now I m started to train for a half marathon and I noticed by the bottom of my heel, by my Achilles, it s very sore and somewhat painful. I am just wondering if this has to do with my previous injury or the fact that I m running a lot more or if it was never properly diagnosed.......It is very tight when I stretch the Achilles but all other range of motion is just like my other ankle.

Associated injuries of knee joints, soft tissue infections and other associate problems also go with Panchakarma which alleviates pain, improves function, decrease disability and strengthen joints.Internal medicines, external applications, Anushastra i.e. 'rakta' mokshan ( leech therapy), 'Agnikarma' (heat/ cauterization treatment as described by Sushruta - an originator of Surgery. In preface of Belly and Love's Surgery book, tribute is given to Sushruta) also have the full potential to cure it without modern surgical invasion. 'Agnikarma' is a para surgical procedure.But for this you have to find a good Ayurveda hospital with all the facilities. In India there are many Ayurveda hospitals fully equipped to treat such cases. Indoor stay will not be more than TKR surgery and even if it exceeds, you haven't gone through the trauma, fear of failure and vast expenses of modern surgery full of risks in such cases.I would definitely recommend Ayurveda treatment at a good Ayurveda Hospital in India if you want to avoid surgery.Hope it helps you."},{"Patient":"Got a tibia plateau compressed fracture non surgical.

A bursa sac was removed and a 3/4 inch partial tear was cleaned up along with every nook and cranny in that area. While in physical therapy, I experienced burning, searing pain starting from the top of my arm and running down my bicep to my elbow, over my forearm, to my thumb and across my wrist. I could not hold a glass without violent, uncontrollable, shaking and trembling. This lasted over the weekend and gradually I was able to hold a glass without the shaking and trembling. I stopped therapy now for about 10 days because any movement causes unbearable pain. The agony from the burning pain remains and I have no strength in my hand. The joint in my thumb clicks and pops and burns. My shoulder pulls and tugs at my elbow. Now, burning pain spreads across my back on both shoulders! There is deep burning in both of my shoulders now that I can t escape from. Now my left shoulder is experiencing similar symptoms as my right! The burning on my back, shoulders and arms is driving me crazy. I have also been experiencing pain and nagging burning in my right leg for 2 months now. Yesterday, I suddenly couldn t stand on my right leg. Burning pain started at my knee, down my shin and over the top of my foot. It hasn t stopped and I can t apply any weight on my leg and foot. The pain is bone deep and I can t bend my ankle without it triggering burning pain that runs up and down the front of my leg. I can t walk on that leg at all. I put a knee brace on my knee and I can hobble for a few minutes at a time. The odd thing is: I DIDN T FALL OR TWIST MY RIGHT LEG AT ALL! Is it just a coincidence that my knee, leg and foot problem just hit without any relationship to my shoulder problems? It s hard not to connect the two because the debilitating pain and symptoms are the same! My bones, joints and muscles burn and stab! Period! And I am quickly going downhill fast! I have not told my doctor or surgeon yet because I can t make any sense of this and I fear them to not take this seriously. But I know that this is NOT normal and I need some insight PLEASE!! I have been taking Celebrex for about a month now and am wondering if, in some weird way, this is part of the problem?

It felt like it was coming from my spine at first, but after adjusting positions in order to relieve the pressure, I realized that the pain was coming from a few inches to the left of my spine and I could not find a position to relieve the pain even slightly. After an hour the pain was unbearable and I had a bowel movement. During a quick shower the pain shifted to the my abdomen, to the left and below my belly button and the pain increased. My stomach muscles were tight making another bowel movement impossible though pushing made the pain tolerable for a moment. I then began to pour sweat even though I felt cold. Eventually I threw up a lot of water, though it appeared a bit grayish. Then, while laying on the bathroom floor, the pain gradually subsided over the next 5 to 10 minutes until all the symptoms were gone. A few hours later I feel a light pain in my back and I m worried that the episode might repeat before I have a chance to see a doctor. If I had normal insurance I would have gone to the ER, but I have only a VA medical plan. I apologize for the length of this, I m trying to provide all information up front.

Food to be avoided in diet includes –meat and poultry. The most abundant source of purines are the full range of meats: beef, pork, poultry, fish and other seafood. Organ meats are especially high in purines and should be avoided completely on a gout diet. When reducing meat, get protein from other sources including low-fat dairy, eggs and plant-based sources such as beans, legumes, soybeans and whole grains.AlcoholAlcohol reduces the ability of your body to excrete uric acid via the kidneys and urine. If your gout is severe or you are having an attack, avoid alcohol completely. Increase your daily intake of water. As the water is turned into urine, it carries uric acid out of your body. Institute of Medicine recommends that adult men drink 3 litres of water daily; women should drink 2 litres.Processed CarbohydratesProcessed carbohydrates and sugars take the place of healthy carbohydrates, such as fruits and vegetables, in your diet. Although no direct link has been established between sugar intake and gout severity, high sugar intake can contribute to obesity, a risk factor for gout. The fibre in fruits, vegetables and whole grains may also help carry excess uric acid out of your body.Hope this answers your query.

Food to be avoided in diet includes –meat and poultry. The most abundant source of purines are the full range of meats: beef, pork, poultry, fish and other seafood. Organ meats are especially high in purines and should be avoided completely on a gout diet. When reducing meat, get protein from other sources including low-fat dairy, eggs and plant-based sources such as beans, legumes, soybeans and whole grains.AlcoholAlcohol reduces the ability of your body to excrete uric acid via the kidneys and urine. If your gout is severe or you are having an attack, avoid alcohol completely. Increase your daily intake of water. As the water is turned into urine, it carries uric acid out of your body. Institute of Medicine recommends that adult men drink 3 litres of water daily; women should drink 2 litres.Processed CarbohydratesProcessed carbohydrates and sugars take the place of healthy carbohydrates, such as fruits and vegetables, in your diet. Although no direct link has been established between sugar intake and gout severity, high sugar intake can contribute to obesity, a risk factor for gout. The fibre in fruits, vegetables and whole grains may also help carry excess uric acid out of your body.Hope this answers your query.

Findings suggestive of a 3 mm articular surface tear is noted involving the distal and posterior aspect the supraspinatus tendon. The subscapularis and teres minor tendons appear intact. There is no evidence of rotator cuff related muscle atrophy. GLENOHUMERAL JOINT: Normal alignment. No evidence of an intra-articular loose body. Regions of grade II chondromalacia demonstrated throughout the glenoid fossa. GLENOID LABRUM: There is a single suture anchor traversing the mid to posterosupier aspect of the glenoid related to a superior labral repair.

Also stress fractures in the foot could be a cause. I advise you to get seen by an Orthopaedic surgeon and get required X-rays and other investigations like Serum uric acid as necessary. Avoid bearing weight on that foot. Use crutches to help get around.

You can actually see my skin jump, like muscle spasms. I guess I should include that I have a spinal cord injury (bulgings discs in cervical area), plus I have symptoms of brain leakage (My Dr already put in an order for an MRI for my brain-still waiting to schedule appt). The two are probably unrelated but in the even that it is NOT my liver fluttering, I want professionals to know the full story. I MAY have had an aneurysm in my brain resulting from my car accident in May 2014 (which caused the possible leakage initially), and if my online research has served me well, I am likely due for another aneurysm in the future. By the way, my spinal injuries resulted from a rear ending accident involving an 18 wheeler (ive been going to PT for 5 months now).

I m currently seeing a doctor that s been treating me for several things such as fybromyalgia and arthritis, among other issues that cause me chronic pain. My doctors office is getting strict about what type of medications are prescribed and also the dosage because of the serious issue about the abuse of medications in this country. I m currently prescribed oxycodone and zanaflex that do help, and I take it as prescribed. My doctor worked with me the last 2 years to get to this level of pain management. But now she is being forced to send me to a pain specialist to take over my pain medications. I was sent to a pain clinic and all they want to prescribe me is Lyrica, which I cannot take because of my edema and heart conditions. I don t know what to do at this point because I ve already went through the guinea pig stage for a few years and was seeing up to 8 or more doctors while they were diagnosing me. I feel like I m starting all over again. What should I do? I really need help with this issue. Also I cannot afford to see all my doctors as it is unless my disability to approved. Maybe this site can help me with finding a doctor in my area that can help me with my pain management and not only offer me a medication I cannot take. Because Lyrica could cause me serious health problems and /or death and I can t believe that s what the pain specialist wants to give me considering the informatin stated in my medical records. There are safe alternatives to manage my pain that my doctor has had me on for a couple of years that I would like to continue rather than suffer and be given a drug that s not safe for me. I don t understand why the pain specialist can only offer me Lyrica that I absolutely cannot take. They said that s the only medication they give for fybromyalgia. Well for one, that s not my only problem and two, it s NOT safe. I have spoken with many other s that have fybro and they are all on some form of narcotic. I only know of a few that took Lyrica and all but one had to stop taking it because of side effects. It s not worth the risk. The first doctor that diagnosed me with fybromyalgia 4-5 years ago told me Lyrica isn t for everyone and only helps a small percentage of people. He said the risks way out weigh the benefits and he doesn t prescibe it and turn his patients in to a guinea pig for the drug companies. Can you help me with finding a good Doctor in my area that s more concerned about my health and well being rather than cater to the pharmaceutical companies, please I don t know what to do. My current family doctor is out of the office till the end of this month & I don t know at this point what she can do for me. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks  for  your query.Fibromyalgia can not be totally cured, you can only minimise symptoms by taking various medications. You can take amitryptiline and duloxetin or you can start Lyrica (pregabalin) consulting you’re treating doctor.Exercises and stretches plays important role in maintaining symptoms of fibromyalgia.Physiotherapy like ultrasound and tens will help, along with exercises.A holistic approach is required, which includes exercises, meditation, SKY [sudarshan kriya yoga] and acupuncture along with healthy diet and herbs.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"yes I am a physician but am asking about my insulin dependent husband age 64 Hispanic iddm for 35 years good control having left arm slight pain like a spasm that left but has what he calls a slight strain, does not sound like an mi but still wonder if need to get ekg now, not sounding like a classic mi but still w the iddm worried","Doctor":"Hi, Pain in the left arm in a diabetic needs an ekg to rule out an angina regardless of the intensity of the pain.

With this my jaw has bothered me but its ok because the pain is not severe. Over the past few months my chest hurts when breathing but this happens every now and then. Just today I discovered that the top part of my gums are a very dark color and was thinking maybe that can be a reason why my face has been hurting me. Also within the past two weeks I have gotten really dizzy and feel like I need to puke. This may be nothing but is this something I should take a little more serious?","Doctor":"TMJ dislocation or dysfunction is not very common like regular knee or back pain. Resting (Jaw movement) should be more than enough for little problem to resolve. However, if rest isn't solving the pain or dysfunction then you must get one X-Ray and consultation of Orthopaedician done.Meanwhile, avoid hard food to chew and speak minimal to give proper rest.'Shitali' pranayama/breathing can help to reduce excessive heat in mouth or chest region."},{"Patient":"I would like to know if my pinky toe is broken, sprained etc. i stubbed it yesterday, there was a very minor cut it does not hurt, i put neosporin on it.

The swelling and tightness is still there it shows that some thing is amiss in your treatment and needs medical attention  .It's important not to disturb the splint if applied , as this is holding your fractured finger in position Physical or occupational therapy treatments are helpful for easing the stiffness and helping you regain thumb movement . I suggest you to see a specialist  for proper guidance .Meanwhile , take care of your diet . Include  anti-inflammatory  fruits and plants as  pineapples, capers, apples, and red onions,  ginger garlic and Turmeric , Aloe Vera  , olive oil , Lemon  and Banana also   Healthy immune systems also that are considered to help early recovery .Hope this helps solves your query .Take care , All the best .Wish Get well soon .Don't hesitate to get back tf have any further query ."},{"Patient":"I am having sharp stabbing pain in my right side below my rib cage that comes in spasms especially if I am walking or moving around.

Sometimes I hear a snap when I change from a standing to a sitting position. I never know when I stand up if it ll make the snapping sound or if I can put weight on it right away when standing. My hips are arthritic and the right one has bone spurs, but there s still a little cartilage there. It s not bone on bone. Celebrex 2 times a day has not alleviated the condition at all, so I don t think it s inflammation from arthritis. I think it s the ligaments in the front. I used to do splits (I m 69) and can still do them tho not all the way down. The last time I did them was 2 weeks ago. I suspect doing splits a few times a month was probably not so good for those front ligaments. I m a very active person. I played tennis for 25 years, bowled, play golf (I walk 9 holes for some exercise). The exercise that seems to help the most is elliptical machine, or being in the swimming pool where I do a bicycle motion with my legs and a figure 8 motion with my arms. The recombant bike aggravated it, as does reclining in a chair with the legs straight out. When I sleep I try to bend my legs so they re not straightened. I m thinking of going to a sports med doctor. Is there any way to check the health or condition of the front ligaments?","Doctor":"Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns.osteoarthritis of right hip is your diagnosis,it is evidenced by your history of excess physical activity and age.In this condition there will be loss of cartilage between two bones which is a protective from  both bone ends to get rubbed. So loss of cartilage leads to exposure of actual bone and they get rubbed each other and there will be loss of bone contour.Bone spurs are indicative of osteoporosis in which bone mineral density decreased and as a compensation there will be excess calcium deposition.To prevent further damage.-have good rest.-take calcium supplements-avoid excess hip movements and decrease weight on hip by using a cane if you likePermanent treatment will be done by surgical procedure,like total hip replacement or by refining the surfaces.Use pain killers like ibuprofen.About the front ligaments, once the hip pathology decreases it will automatically comes down.Stiffness is due inflammation around the joint due to friction of the bone ends.Consult a orthopedic or sports medicine specialist.Hope this answers your question.

I can move toes but when I do the tingling gets super intense and when I put pressure on my foot it hurts but not unbearable","Doctor":"It's a blunt trauma and toes are somewhat sprained.Any mild analgesic and anti inflammatory can relieve the pain such as PCM or Ibuprofen 1 sos if it is not allergic.To my own patients I also say to drink little turmeric mixed powder in warn milk or water for few days. It's a powerful herb ( kitchen soice) doing healing and has anti inflammatory properties. Turmeric is tasteless. So no problem. May use Haridra pure herbs capsules too ( its also turmeric inside).Turmeric may also be applied on traumatised site or on open wounds too, by mixing in warm clarified butter for fastest relief.

He is however still limping. Your thoughts?","Doctor":"If he is playing well there is not much to worry.However limping could be because of temporary pain but if it doesn't improve in a week consult ortho surgeon.To my own patients I recommend to use Turmeric powder with warm milk or water. It's potent antiinflammatory and natural healer as well as anti infective. But children would not take it. For them you can get Haridra capsules by Himalya Pure herbs series.

All together could be almost 3 inches. Leg pain, felt dizziness and thought I was going to faint the night before last. Nausea. Do I need to go to urgent care?","Doctor":"If it persists with pain and swelling, it may get suppurated too. Swollen lymph nodes already denote some underlying infection. It is better to take antibiotics and may get removed by surgeon , if he so directs.People who want to avoid surgery to the extent possible, we direct as per Ayurveda principle to start taking curcumin ( turmeric powder) in warm milk or water twice a day or Haridra capsules of Himalya pure herb series.This is also curcumin. Alongwith this, Kanchnar guggul and Arogyavardhini Vati 2 bid each may be started. If suppuration has not already started, it will subside it. If started, it will ripen , drain and dried with no further complications. No side effects.

It could be little unknown trauma or insect sting or general allergy ( lesser chances otherwise it would effect lower lip too).No cream is advised.

If you have to give for long period, then ask paediatrician first.However natural cure Turmeric powder in milk and water also effects without side effects.

I propose to wait a month from the trauma. If this sensation persist, get an electromyography/electroneurography to objectivate the nerve injury. if positive, do a RMN of wrist and hand to understand the cause (ie. hematoma) and project its possible removal. concerning instead your doubt about a scaphoid fracture, I don't know which xray projections you did (scaphoid fractures are hard to be seen in standard xrays). however, if your wrist remained very painful for 10-15 days after the trauma, a scaphoid xray projection or, better, a wrist CT, would solve your doubts"},{"Patient":"I had a really bad bruise on the back of my leg about 3 weeks ago.

First of all I would like to assure you that you need not panic. Yes, you need to seek medical attention, but it can be easily managed once diagnosed properly. Numbness can be caused due to a lot of factors, primarily, due to bulging of discs in the spinal column, causing pressure on the nerve roots that supply to your foot and hands. Secondly, deficiency of Vitamin D, can cause muscular and neuronal weakness. You may be more prone to this if you are obese or have a lifestyle which requires you to do long hours of sitting or prolonged stay indoors, without enough sunlight. So its highly recommended that you get a BT (blood test) done to find out Vit. D level and calcium levels and also X-ray of Cervical as well as Lumbar spine are recommended to rule out any disc bulges. Once the cause is diagnosed , the treatment will be effective, comprising of dietary management, and Vit. D supplements for a couple of weeks and an exercise regime. Although, you can always start walking to tone up your muscles and strengthen them , which will also help control your weight. I hope this information is helpful to you .Take care and have a nice day:)Dr. Nidhi Sood (PT)"},{"Patient":"I am a distance runner. Last week after a run I woke in the middle of night with sharp pains in the side of my thigh. Not what I would consider an injury that has slowed me down much but it burns at times really bad. I am thinking strain. How long should I rest my leg? If I continue to run will an injury like this heal but much slower? Or will it get worse without rest?","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM.  I understand how it can be very challenging to pursue running with so much pain. The pain you have is due to a condition called, Iliotibial Band Syndrome (ITBS), it is the most common overuse injuries among runners. It occurs when the iliotibial band, the ligament that runs down the outside of the thigh from the hip to the shin, is tight or inflamed.The IT band attaches to the knee and helps stabilize and move the joint. When the IT band isn't working properly, movement of the knee (and, therefore, running) becomes painful. IT band pain can be severe enough to completely sideline a runner for weeks, or even longer. Here is a list of Do's and Dont's that will surely help you! Do's:1. The best way to get rid of it for good is to rest immediately. That means fewer miles, or no running at all. In the majority of runners, resting immediately will prevent pain from returning. If you don't give yourself a break from running, ITBS can become chronic.2. While you're backing off on your mileage, you can cross-train. Swimming, pool running, cycling, and rowing are all fine. Stair-climbing is not, because it is too much like running3. When running on a track, change directions repeatedly and always do icing for minimum of 10 min to help reduce inflammation. 4. Make sure your shoes aren't worn along the outside of the sole. If they are, replace them.5. Walk a quarter- to half-mile before you start your runs. 6. See a Physical therapist near you and get a few sessions of Ultrasonic therapy. Dont's :1. Don't run on concrete surfaces. I hope this information is helpful to you.Take care and have a nice day :)Dr. Nidhi Sood (PT)"},{"Patient":"I fell during skateboarding.

There are many common causes for the swelling, including arthritis, injury to the ligaments or meniscus, or when fluid collects in the bursa. This condition is known as prepatellar bursitis.Knee effusion is a large bursa between the inferior part of the femur and the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle. It usually communicates with the cavity of the knee joint and is pathologically distended with blood or synovial fluid in suprapatellar bursitis (\\"water on the knee\\").A small amount of fluid exists in normal joints. When a joint is affected by arthritis, particularly an inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), increased abnormal amounts of fluid buildup, the knee appears swollen. The fluid is produced by the tissues that are affected by the arthritis and that line the joint."},{"Patient":"hi I developed R shoulder pain after a motorcycle trip out west last summer ending in September pain became unbearable October saw family DR X-Ray reveled inflammation dose of steroids gave relief but pain returned and started in L shoulder and I have been getting increasingly tired and gained 15 pounds and as I am obese I think people are taking it for being lazy . of witch I am not but it is becoming a effort to exercise.

They tried to treat it with lasers, but it didn t help. He had an MRI and the tech said there was a shadow that could have been from a mass or mini stroke. He never got to follow up with the doctor because he lost his health insurance. I don t think it was ethical for the tech to tell him anything and I m hoping if it was serious, the doctor would have called him. He has migraine or migraine-like headaches a lot, but he s also under tremendous stress from an ugly divorce. He said his eye gets worse when his stress gets worse. He said everything is wavy and when he looks at a person s face, he see black. Is this something that will go away in time and are headaches normal with macular edema? Thank you for your help.","Doctor":"If your Eye  makes a macular edema diagnosis due to diabetes or retinal vein occlusion, focal laser treatment is often used to reduce swelling of the macula. With this form of laser surgery, your Eye M.D. applies many tiny laser pulses to areas of fluid leakage around the macula. The main goal of treatment is to stabilize vision by sealing off leaking blood vessels that interfere with the proper function of the macula. In some cases, vision loss may be improved with laser treatment.A patient may need focal laser surgery more than once to control the leaking fluid. If you have macular edema in both eyes and require laser surgery, generally only one eye will be treated at a time, usually several weeks apart.Medication injection therapy is also being used to treat macular edema. Two drugs —steroids and anti-VEGF agents — have shown promise in reducing diabetic macular edema.Anti-VEGF drugs target a specific chemical in your eye called vascular endothelial growth factor — or VEGF — that is critical in causing abnormal blood vessels to grow under the retina. Several drugs have been developed that can block the trouble-causing VEGF. An anti-VEGF drug can help treat macular edema by reducing the growth of abnormal blood vessels and slowing their leakage, which helps to slow vision loss.Medication injection therapy is performed in the doctor's office. An anesthetic is used to numb the eye, and a tiny needle is inserted into the eye to deliver the medication near the retina.For people with diabetes, controlling blood sugar and blood pressure is another method of macular edema treatment.To treat cystoid macular edema, where the eye is irritated by the presence of a new lens, your Eye M.D. may prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) eyedrops for a few months. If these drops do not help to reduce the edema and improve vision, you may need to use steroid drops. Sometimes, more powerful steroid injections around or even inside the eye may be used. In rare cases, when cystoid macular edema does not respond to drops or shots, vitrectomy surgery may be needed to clear the gel inside the eye. Also, in rare instances, a lens replacement may be required.Sometimes the swelling in your eye can cause you to have increased pressure within the eye, called glaucoma.

Try to rest the affected joint as much as possible until you feel better.If you have arthritis, exercising the hip joint with low-impact exercises, stretching, and resistance training can reduce pain and improve joint mobility. For example, swimming is a good non-impact exercise for arthritis. Physical therapy can also help increase your range of motion.If you have a knee injury, you may worry that exercising could cause more damage or pain. But the opposite is true: Strengthening the muscles that support your knee, and keeping them flexible, is the best way to prevent further injuries. Start slowly, and build your strength over time. Some muscle soreness is normal when you exercise. But you shouldn’t feel more pain, especially in your knee. If you do, stop and contact your doctor."},{"Patient":"I heard a snap like sound in the outside of my right bicep while adhering the leash to my dog.

The hand is still feeling slightly weird when I fully contract it. Any idea what this could be?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks  for  your query.Seems that you are  suffering from cervical spondylitis, the giddiness & the sensation of loss of balance in her case is termed as CERVICAL VERTIGO. This is generally a benign condition and is usually self limiting.The general treatment guidelines for her condition is as follows -Use a soft cervical Collar: Soft collar allow the muscles of the neck to rest and limit neck motion. This can help decrease pinching of nerve roots with movement. Soft collars should only be worn for short periods of time, because long-term wear can decrease the strength of neck muscles.Medicines: Analgesic are needed in the acute phase (Ibuprofen, Diclofenac, Naproxen etc). Muscle relaxants are essential for relieving muscle spasm. Neurotropic vitamins like METHYLCOBALAMINE orPREGABALIN will help in alleviating the neuropathic pain.Cervical traction: may enlarge the disc space, permitting the disc protrusions to regress back. Intermittent cervical traction for not more than 30 minutes at a time will suffice.Physiotherapy: Once the acute phase of pain has subsided, Isometric strengthening exercises of the paravertebral muscles are started, under the supervision of a qualified physiotherapist . I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"Hello, I was lifting heavy, performing the deadlift as I lifted the bar off the floor I heard and felt a pop in my right forearm so I had to set the bar down without completely performing the lift.

I can understand your concern .Dear , there are so many factors which lead to such a painful situation . removing the affecting  factors  can help alley pains .90% of your problem is solved  Any condition that puts excessive pressure on the legs or abdomen can lead to varicosity. Being  an equestrian can also be one of the causes . Hormonal fluctuations during pregnancy and menopause may be responsible for the high proportion of varicosities among women. Dietary deficiencies or the loss of skin elasticity due to aging are contributory factors. Prolonged standing or sitting, constipation, constrictive clothing, lack of exercise, obesity, or repeated heavy lifting can interfere with normal circulation to increase the likelihood that varicose veins will develop-and can worsen existing varicosities.To get out of this rutt and to  remain healthy through out life ahead ,it is essential to modify your life style .  I would like to suggest you to increase your immunity by include regular balanced diet containing all essential nutrients and regular exercise for proper blood circulation  & Yoga's stretching and relaxation techniques can be particularly beneficial for varicose veins. Certain positions, such as the Plow, Corpse, and Half Shoulder Stand, promote circulation and the drainage of blood from the legs. The deep-breathing exercises in yoga may further alleviate discomfort by getting more oxygen into the bloodstream.Get plenty of sleep. The body needs recovery . Aim for at least 7 hours of sleep every night. .learn to be active with pain, reduce your drugs and stay more on your will, regular exercise schedule is a must, and staying busy is the key. meditation gives you mental strength .Application of Hot pack or hot water bottle wrapped in a towel on painful part helps alley your pains .

The history of the condition you mentioned is suggestive of migraine, or a cervicogenic headache, which is it is caused due to stiffness in cervical spine due to bad posture.

And also nubmness in hand in swimming pool is caused by low BP Digestion is a complicated job that requires precise coordination between the digestive, nervous, and circulatory systems .In some people, the heart and blood vessels don’t respond as they should. That causes blood pressure to decrease everywhere but the digestive system. The sudden drop usually announces itself as dizziness or lightheadedness is called postprandial hypotension. Some people are genetically predisposed to postprandial hypotension. In others, it comes on after a stroke, accident, or other trauma damages key nerves or blood pressure sensors .You can avoid several lifestyle changes  which can make a difference:. Drinking 12 to 18 ounces of water 15 minutes before eating can evade a fall in blood pressure. Larger meals are more likely to trigger postprandial hypotension than smaller ones. . White bread and other foods made with highly refined flour, white rice, potatoes, and sugary beverages pass quickly from the stomach to the small intestine. This rapid transit contributes to postprandial hypotension. Slowly digested whole grains, beans, protein, and healthy oils may keep your blood pressure up after a meal.It is advised to see your doctor for further guidance .Hope this helps solves your query .Take care , All the best .Wish Get well soon .Don't hesitate to get back tf have any further query ."},{"Patient":"I previously had arthroscopic subacromial decompression withe distal clavicle resection and remove of one spur and arthritic bone from collarbone on myour left shoulder.

And I work in a hospital and am a runner so I wear good good shoes.

No particular pain unless I try to manipulate it.","Doctor":"Dear patient You have got mallet finger deformity which is acute flexion  at distal interphalangeal joint and unable to extend  it. This happens due to sudden hyper flexion at distal IP  joint which leads to  avulsion of extensor  tendon from its base. I would advise Xray of  involved finger anteroposterior and lateral  views to confirm diagnosis. You need to wear mallet finger splint for 3 weeks to allow tendon healing to its place. If this does not benefit you need to consult expert hand specialist  and get yourself examined.  All the best."},{"Patient":"I had a tummy tuck and liposuction exactly two weeks ago.

For about a month or so I ve been getting twitching all over my body, mostly in my feet, legs, and arms. Recently my fingers have been twitching too. This morning my right index finger and thumb were moving nonstop for about 5 hours. My left hand gets shaky and my left middle finger feels stiff. I had blood work done a month ago for something unrelated and the only abnormal result was a vitamin D level of 17. Could this be the cause and if not what could be? Thank you.","Doctor":"Dear patient Twitching all over body is not caused directly by vitamin d deficiency  but low calcium levels in blood leads to nerve hyper excitability  and twitching. So low vitamin d levels leads to low serum calcium levels and hence responsible for muscle spasms and tetany. Was serum levels of calcium done? If not done you should go for serum levels of calcium , phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase  to confirm diagnosis.  Visit reputed laboratory nearby you and get it done.  In case of vitamin d deficiency serum levels of calcium and phosphorus  is low  and alkaline phosphatase is high. Treatment  is oral vitamin d tab 60k  units once a week for 6 weeks with tab shelcal 500 mg thrice a day. For one month.  For immediate relief injection calcium gluconate can also be given.

I wondered if my cartilage could have come unattached again, and be causing my pain.","Doctor":"Dear patient There  are two possibilities 1. Progress of your disease 2.  Detachment of cartilage. What was the reason for previous detachment?  If it was trauma then chance of recurrence is less. If it was due to other cause disease progressing is more likely.

It is commonly associated with damage to other ligaments around the knee.These structures are important shock-absorbers and stabilizers for the knee joint, hence you must see an orthopedic surgeon at the earliest.He/she can examine your knee and suggest an imaging study-MRI.Until you get to the doctor, rest the leg and do ice application, it may bring some relief.Take care."},{"Patient":"CT Scan report mentions \\"mild thickening of the terminal ileum with some prominent mesentric lymphnodes suggestive of inflamatery changes\\".

Women often complain of bruising on legs, thighs, buttocks and upper arms. Thinner people are more prone to bruising as they lack the fat cushion that helps prevent injury. It may also be due to deficiency of vitamin C, vitamin B12, folic acid and vitamin K.Many times taking medications like aspirin, ibuprofen, non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and even birth control pills increases chances of sudden bruising. Topical and systemic corticosteroids cause skin thinning, making one prone to bruises. Many a time bruising can be caused due to liver ailments, kidney diseases and blood disorder.

As per your symptoms there are couple of possibilities. If you have chest congestion and chest discomfort then it can be related to lungs and I suggest to take x ray and check properly for any sort of lung issue or chest infection.If there is no chest congestion and its only tightness of left side chest then it can also be related to cardiac issue. I suggest to visit cardiologist do your ECG along with treadmill test to evaluate further.If there is no issue at lung and heart level then it is muscular pain only at left shoulder blade which is radiating to left side chest as well as armpit level. But this pain can also be indication of problem at cervical spine like loss of cervical curve or disc related issues. How ever for this I suggest to visit orthopedic doctor and get yourself evaluated properly and take treatment as per that.Here I suggest do visit a physio for further treatment planning as per orthopedic suggestion because physiotherapy treatment will help you to overcome the pain as well physiotherapy exercises will help you to improve the biomechanics of cervical spine, shoulder blade as well shoulder joint which will further help you to have long term relief.

The remedial treatment for gout includes -1.Pain killer like naproxen, Ibuprofen .along with short course of cortisone.2.Drugs which lower the uric acid like- allopurinol and febuxostat.These are prescription only drugs so you may have to contact your local doctor. In addition to medication, the following suggestion may help to reduce pain--1. Ice fomentation- If the pain is not severe, try cold packs or cold compresses on the joint to lessen the inflammation and help the pain. Ice the joint for 20 to 30 minutes several times a day.2. Rest the joint.-. Raise the joint if you can on a pillow or other soft object.3. Plenty of water -A lack of water in your body can makes your uric acid levels raise even higher than they already are. Drinking water will help your body stabilize uric acid to a normal level.4 Dietary advice- The Purines, which are chemicals found in some food, when they are taken in food are broken down into uric acid.

Often called wear-and-tear arthritis, osteoarthritis occurs when the protective cartilage on the ends of your bones wears down over time. Osteoarthritis treatments can slow the progression of the disease, relieve pain and improve joint function.I would suggest getting this evaluated by an orthopedician for detailed examination. You may get the X-ray/MRI, some blood tests and joint fluid analysis under his/her guidance to reach the accurate diagnosis.The following measures will help with the painDo regular Exercise. Exercise can increase your endurance and strengthen the muscles around your joint, making your joint more stable. Stick to gentle exercises, such as walking, biking or swimming. Lose weight if you are obese- Being overweight or obese increases the stress on your weight-bearing joints, such as your knees and your hips. Even a small amount of weight loss can relieve some pressure and reduce your pain.Use heat and cold to manage pain. Both heat and cold can relieve pain in your joint. Heat also relieves stiffness and cold can relieve muscle spasms.Apply over-the-counter pain creams. Creams and gels available at the drugstore may provide temporary relief from osteoarthritis pain.Take diet rich in calcium, vitamin d3 and minerals.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"Hi, Lately I have been getting, numbness and a tingling sensation in my hands and fingers.

If im working or with friends i dont notice it. I m not an avid exerciser so it s not because of that. I pretty much go to cheerleading twice a week and that s all. I have a pretty good diet, I think, I eat some junk but not really. I don t eat a lot of sugar. However, I don t drink a lot of water so I was wondering if that could be a reason. Someone once told me that a lack of potassium can cause that... Do you think that could be it? I also heard it could be low magnesium. The tingling started when I was on solodyn an acne med, and I read it s a side effect and I was wondering if it could carry on after I stopped taking it because now I m on monodox. It doesn t have tingling or twitching as a symptom. I watch a lot of TV and I don t have good posture, I spend so much time with my phone in my hand and I was told that could be a reason!

I have the classic swelling but no tenderness. I have seen a doctor and even have had the elbow drained once, but the swelling has returned again.......which the Dr. said was very likely to happen. I realize from the online research I have done that this condition takes weeks or even months to subside on its own.
